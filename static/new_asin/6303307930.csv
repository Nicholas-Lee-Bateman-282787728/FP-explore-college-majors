His victims are disposed of in the basement, which is, laid out as a cemetery and beneath the graves lay a sub chamber where zombie like people are kept and in the end, that is where Bela tries to hide from the law.

624935,3,6303307930,"There is very little that is truly of the horror genre about this movie; modernists and skeptics might say there is very little that is truly of the horror genre in any of Lugosi's movies. But B@M really could be a spy or noir programmer, except for the few chills arriving at the very end with little explanation. Despite some good atmosphere, this film is a quite conventional one, more about crime than the macabre, and having more to do with bank robbing than with grave robbing.
Lugosi plays two roles, both outwardly kind but menacing underneath. Just how menacing we soon see, as Lugosi uses vagrants to carry out daring heists. Then when they have served their purpose, he disposes of them. Or at least he thinks he has disposed of them...
There are some interesting psychological tidbits tucked away into the script, with insight into Lugosi's character; very brief portions are surprisingly literate (if expectedly melodramatic) for this type of film. But there is no mystery at all, and B@M is cheap, spartan and setbound.
The ending is the best part of the film, frantic and relatively exciting; but it is unfortunately out of step with the rest of the movie.
B-fans and Lugosi devotees will enjoy it. At least in his poverty row movies he was not relegated to red herring roles.

 This short (one hour) black and white 1942 flick features Bela Lugosi in a duel role.  He is a brainiac college professor by day (students wore jacket and tie in college in those days) who moonlights as a criminal mastermind.  His specially is safe cracking.  His innovative criminal cover is a soup kitchen in New York Citys infamous Bowery section.  In his criminal mode, he assures the secrecy of his nefarious activities by murdering his criminal cohorts.  Unfortunately for him, a mad confederate re-animates the criminal corpses.  The professor's helper is a doctor who is also, from what we can tell, both a drug addict and a drunk.  He has however managed to find a why to re-animate dead bad guys.
 This is really a crime kingpin sort of movie.  The Zombies play no role in the story and only appear at the end to deliver the Bela Lugosi character his just deserts.  It does provide a new slant on re-animation.  A young collegian is murdered and subsequently re-animated.  He ends the film happily reunited with his lover.  He is seemingly no worse for the experience.  This is so far unique in the film portrayal of Zombies.
 This is not scary at all.  The Zombies are only on screen for a few seconds out of the one hour long film.  They seem to be perfectly normal people, who just happened to have been shot full of hot lead, and then revived.  This film has nothing to recommend it to Zombie aficionados but crime film fans might like it.
 One cool thing you might miss is the movie poster outside of a movie theater.  It advertises a film called The Corpse Vanishes which is another 1942 film staring Bela Lugosi.

624993,3,6303307930,"Bowery at Midnight is one of those shorts that Lugosi made, most likely to put some bread on the table.  He took pretty much anything after being typecast in Dracula (from what I've read).

The story is one of paranoia and secret identities and also the film itself is a reflection of its time: a woman who wants to help the helpless rather than do the right thing - get married and have kids; a man who is used to be rich and realizes he does not know anything about the disadvantaged; and Bella as Carl, a psychologist professor with a loving wife, who takes advantage of his position to create murder and mayhem behind the kind faade of a homeless Mission.

Impressions:

The cold-blooded killer aspect of Bella's character is extremely creepy and he does his part seriously and well.  You just watch fascinated, how long can he keep up the faade until the cops catch him?

The only supernatural aspect of the film is the doctor, a ""human derelict"" who in fact is bringing Bella's victims back to life and keeps them in a basement in a cellar.  Yeow!

John Archer and Wanda McKay co-star. 60 min. Standard; Soundtrack: English mono; scene access. Plays All Regions.

Bottom Line:  Not a bad film. The DVD I have is from ""Digipictures"" or something like that.  Full of pops and scratches and muddy in parts.  There are no special features but a choice of chapters and previews of DVDs they've already made.  Still looking for the better copy!

Picture quality seemed OK, and product arrived intact.  Wouldn't pay more than $10 for it, as it doesn't have a lot of replay value like a major classic (Dracula, etc.) would, but worth a watch for some casual old school B&W suspense.",1367798400,,370,4.257142857142857
624995,3,6303307930,"Bela Lugosi (1882-1956) was at the peak of his career in the 1930s; by the 1940s, however, he had begun to slip, working primarily in B pictures made by second string studios and infamously finishing up in the 1950s in a series of grade Z movies directed by the notorious Ed Wood. Released by Monogram Studios in 1942, BOWERY AT MIDNIGHT finds the actor already into his downward slide, but even so it is neither as bad a few of his earlier B pictures and it is a far cry from his later Z pictures--indeed, and in spite of a nonsensical plot, both the movie and Lugosi received reasonably good reviews.

The story has several clever accents.  Lugosi leads a double life, a respectably married college professor by day and a vicious criminal by night, operating a soup kitchen where he meets and recruits criminals on the run and then has his second in command kill them when they are no longer useful.  Or so he thinks: in actual fact one of his handy men, once a famous doctor, has been busy with experiments, and he has managed to revive a number of Lugosi's victims into zombie-like creatures that will ultimately prove Lugosi's undoing.

It's all a lot of hooey, with police officers running around baffled, frightened heroines, gibbering zombies in the basement, an innocent wife murdered, and a victim who seems to become a zombie but mysteriously returns to health without any explanation.  Even with the marginal run time of sixty minutes the film feels a bit slow, but Lugosi did far worse films, and this one will amuse his many fans.  The sound elements are fuzzy, but the picture is fairly good, and the menu offers a few interesting notes on the production.  Vaguely recommended, but pretty much for hardcore Lugosi fans only.

624996,2,6303307930,"Probably the best Monogram film Lugosi was in with an interesting double life plot, and he's quite a ruthless character and genuine in trying to make this film better than average.  Supporting cast has some recognizable regulars from other Monogram low budget productions, with the addition of Tom Neal, who's talent stood out.  I'm giving this title a low rating not for the movie but for the terrible print.  Much of the print has lines ""dancing"" across the middle of the picture...very distracting!  A shame because the audio is fine, as is the remainder of the image.  I hate to bad-mouth a distributor interested in selling Lugosi, but why bother with a print like this?  This was selling at a dollar store, and was barely worth even that much.

Oh, and I give the rest of the film about two and a half stars because it holds the viewers interest and is fairly entertaining.",1293494400,,879,4.6688311688311686

Bela is a professor who works in the Bowery feeding the homeless. He also employs a mad scientist who in turn employs a bunch of dead guys to wander around in the soup kitchen basement.

I know this sounds intriguing.  However, Bela seems unaware of the zombie workers he has at his disposal.  Bela does not dispatch zombies to commit crimes.  Bela does not use zombies to work in his sugar mill (White Zombie reference).  Bela is simply a kindly professor by day, and ruthless gangster by night.

I don't know when the guy fit in sleep, keeping his marriage together,and maintaining his dual professions.  How does Bela have time to publish anything in journal articles?  Why do other crooks follow orders from some ivory tower type with an accent?

625039,4,6303307930,"Bela is excellent as both the ""good"" professor Brenner, and the cold, heartless, e-vil Kenneth Wagner, owner / operator of the Friendly Mission. No one knows that Wagner is also a sadistic criminal mastermind! He's been using the mission as a front for his underworld enterprises, committing heists and killing off henchmen as fast as he can replace 'em! His office is loaded w/ secret passages and he's got a graveyard in the sub-basement full of his ex-partners in crime! There's even a sub-sub-basement where Wagner's mad doctor pal keeps his unnatural experiments alive! I love this movie! Bela plays his good / bad roles w/ ease and dexterity, never seeming overly angelic nor demonic. Of course, I prefer his wicked persona! BOWERY AT MIDNIGHT would make a perfect double bill w/ HUMAN MONSTER, another of Bela's dual role projects...",1135382400,3,840,5.007142857142857
625040,3,6303307930,"This is a decent movie, provided that you try not to think about it for very long.  BOWERY AT MIDNIGHT (1942) gives Bela Lugosi an opportunity of playing three roles: a mild-mannered college professor, a generous philanthropist, and a ruthless cutthroat crime-boss (he's not playing different characters; he's playing one character who lives a double life... I mean... triple life). Lugosi's a good enough actor to successfully pull this off, but the script doesn't do him any favors.

Judy and her smug, pompous boyfriend Richard don't realize it, but they both know Bela Lugosi's character.  Judy knows him as Karl Wagner, a gentle soul -- a man who cheerfully donates his time running a soup kitchen in an extremely impoverished area.  Richard is a bland college boy, enrolled in a psychology class taught by Lugosi's Professor Fredrick Brenner.  Neither of them realizes that Bela Lugosi appears in both their lives.  Nor do they suspect him of being a criminal mastermind, who somehow manages to keep his hideout (disguised in the back of the soup kitchen) fully staffed with villains even though he seems to kill off a heavy during each robbery.  (How do his underlings not realize that eventually he's going to kill them?  Don't they notice that every thug around them is being bumped off?)

This film is only 62 minutes long, and it makes no attempts at being anything except a fun diversion.  It's a standard, straightforward thriller with a slight supernatural element.  I didn't find it particularly scary or horrific, but it's absorbing enough.  It's strange that I could clearly notice how clueless the characters would have to be to do some of the things they do; yet I was still interested in seeing how everything turned out.  Oddly, it's Bela Lugosi's deceitful and murderous character who turns out to be the most likable.  Richard and Judy are far far too boring to cheer for.

In addition to the characters' extreme density, the script contains several portions that just don't make much sense.  Or at least don't give the audience enough to figure out why things are happening.  I don't need everything spelled out for me, but a little explanation would have gone a long way.  Using the soup kitchen as a front for criminal activities makes sense, but why does he hide the charity from his wife?

Why bother splitting the nice, kindly professor identity away from the nice, kindly soup kitchen owner identity?  Which is the ""real"" personality?  Why does Richard give differing accounts of his future term paper to the professor and to his girlfriend?  Obviously he's lying to one or the other, but why bother?  (It's vaguely implied that he's telling the truth to Judy and lying to the professor about what he's writing.  I can't recommend that as a successful way of getting a decent grade at the end of the semester.)

I'm reviewing the Digiview edition of this DVD, and after viewing several of the discs from that company, I can only assume that they don't hire a copy editor for the text on the back cover.  Despite the written summary, Judy (Wanda McKay) is not Professor Brenner's student.

The picture on this Digiview disc is a little murky in places, but its perfectly viewable.  The sound quality can be muffled at times, but, again, it's definitely acceptable.

The script relies far too heavily on unbelievable coincidences.  Judy and Richard just happen to know the same man.  Every major criminal in the city randomly wanders into Wagner's soup kitchen.  Still, I had fun while watching and that counts for a lot.  The fact that it's so short helps.  Extended for another hour, these flaws would be more than enough to sink the film.  As it stands now, it doesn't fully add up but it's definitely an entertaining hour.",1122076800,2,3754,4.839874411302983
625041,4,6303307930,"Monogram Pictures were poverty-row quality, but here, as in a few other Lugosi movies, they make the most of their limited resources and even make a virtue out of them. I don't remember any other movie that captured the seedy, dusty atmosphere of the Bowery as this one. The plot is actually a very interesting one, with a psychology professor masquerading at night as a mission proprietor to front his third line, robbery and murder. Lugosi, in my opinion a vastly underrated and stereotyped actor, does a wonderful job in differentiating the three personae of Professor Brenner (aka Karl Wagner). His tenderness and affection for his wife are very convincingly portrayed; the only real and unexpected jolt is his murdering her in order to prevent the police from discovering his double life. Here is an example of the film's being a bit too short and not being able to fully deliniate the contradictions of the main character; otherwise, this is one of the most interesting interpretations that Bela Lugosi achieved onscreen. The ending is really frightening, as it is suddenly and swiftly presented to the viewer.",1087171200,,1116,5.005376344086022
625042,4,6303307930,"Bowery at Midnight (1942) stars Bela Lugosi in one of his many 'poverty row' films, a time when Lugosi was on the outs with the major studios and subsequently worked with independent studios like Monogram and PRC.  Directed by Wallace Fox (the back of the box mistakenly says Wallace 'Cox'), most known for his westerns, who also directed another one of Lugosi's low-end films called The Corpse Vanishes (1942).  Bela plays three roles in this film, a kindly soup kitchen operator on skid row, a psychology professor and loving husband, and finally a vicious crime lord (I kept wondering when this character found time to sleep).

Basically the plot runs that Bela runs a soup kitchen, enlisting the aid of various criminal elements that pass through to perform heists, jobs, scores, whatever, while maintaining a secret life as a educator...once an individual outlives his usefulness in Lugosi's crime organization, that individual is then eliminated, keeping turnover high and costs down.  This also helped to keep Lugosi's activities secret.  Also, if a henchman exhibited the slightest bit of treachery, he was gone...like all the way gone, if you know what I mean (I love how they would bury these poor fellows in the basement, and then put markers with their names, no less, showing where each one rested.  Not the smartest move, in my opinion, but whatever).  And that soup kitchen/criminal lair...I haven't seen that many secret doors in like...well...ever.  How in the heck did they keep track of all of them?  Anyway, one of Bela's students, who is involved with Bela's female assistant at the soup kitchen, decides to do a paper on transients, unaware that his teacher is also the man in charge of the soup kitchen.  He finds himself in dire trouble as he stumbles across Bela's alter ego, and soon the police are involved.  There was an actor in the movie, Dave O'Brien, who plays a detective, which I recognized from somewhere, but couldn't place until I finally remembered he was also in the movie 'Reefer Madness' aka 'Tell Your Children' (1938).  Soon Bela's worlds begin to collide as the police close in, and he meets a suitable fate involving recently deceased criminals resurrected from the dead?!  This movie has everything.  For a cheapie little movie, I found much to like with the sets and decor.  The makers of this movie may not have had much, but what they had, they used very well.  A fine example of making the best of what you've got.  Oh, and keep an eye out.  About 17 minutes into the movie, you may notice a movie poster for one of Lugosi's other poverty row movies, made within the same year.  The hour run time serves nicely to keep things moving as the pace rarely slows down.

This disc was released by Lugosi's Estate, and has many worthwhile features including a digitally remastered picture from 35mm film elements, commentary by film historian Ted Newsom and Bela Lugosi, Jr., a photo gallery, some trailers featuring Lugosi's other poverty row releases including one with the Bowery Boys, a wonderful mini movie poster insert, and there is even a radio episode called ""Gasoline Cocktail"" from some old time radio crime show.  If you are interested in getting this movie on DVD, this is the one to get, rather than some of those cheaper releases floating around.

625043,4,6303307930,"Man, there is just something about this cheap little flick.  And that something is Bela Lugosi.  Although he is essenially one character, that character plays 3 roles in the film.  Part of the low-brow charm of BOWERY is that, at times, you feel like you're watching 3 different films.  With that lean 61-minute running time, the action comes fast and the body count rises rapidly.
Bela certainly made better poverty-row films (Devil Bat, Invisible Ghost), but BOWERY is still pretty entertaining.
This is the 2nd release by the Lugosi Estate, and it's a keeper.  The picture and sound quality are mostly top-notch (some of the exterior night scenes are pretty murky, but they probably didn't look that great to begin with).  There's another audio commentary track by Bela Lugosi Jr. and genre critic Ted Newsome.  You won't learn much about the movie, but Bela Jr. does have some great memories of his father to share.  You also get another fun radio play starring Bela Sr., and 2 trailers for other Lugosi flicks.
All in all, a must-have for Lugosi fans.  Let's hope his estate will make good on Bela Jr.'s promise to keep 'em coming.",1065657600,5,1136,4.7846153846153845
625044,4,6303307930,"One item few fans know about Bela Lugosi is that, in his spare time, he was an excellent gourmet cook. Give him a few ingredients, a little time, and he could give the Iron Chef a run for his money. This philosophy also influenced Lugosi's films. Quite often he was called upon to make a decent meal from scattered leftovers. Sometimes his main ingredient would be a portion of ham, depending on the film involved. But, give him a good script and he shone like the sun breaking through on a cloudy day.
""Bowery at Midnight"" gives Lugosi a chance to stretch his acting legs. He plays a character who uses three different guises during the course of the film. By day he is a respected professor of criminal psychology as the City University. In his spare time, he is a kindly do-gooder who runs a soup kitchen in the Bowery. But we soon learn this is a cover for his real persona, a snarling, ruthless crime boss who mistreats everyone who had the bad fortune to work for him. Work for this Lugosi at your own peril, for when he has decided you have lost your usefulness, he tosses you to his henchman doctor for disposal. Unknown to Bela, the doc, whom he has also badly misterated, gets revenge by transforming them into zombie-like creatures and keeps them in the mission's basement. When the police catch on, Bela goes to his mistreated employee for help and a place to hide. The doc is more than happy to oblige, leading Bela down the steps to the basement - and his doom at the hands of those he had previously cast aside.
Given the 61 minute running time, the script has to sacrifice characterization for action, but it keeps its continuity quite well and makes sense throughout the film. It's actually fun to see Lugosi in three different characters, going from the pompous, elitist professor of criminology to the kindly, caring social worker to the thoroughly nasty gang boss.
This is the second DVD in the ""Bela Lugosi Presents"" series and like the first, ""The Devil Bat,"" it is loaded with wonderful extras. First, the picture quality is excellent, as it digitally remastered from a 35mm print. You will not find this quality in other DVD versions of this movie. Secondly, the commentary by Ted Newsom and Bela Lugosi, Jr., serves to enhance the viewing experience by filling us in on behind the scenes information on both the film and Bela's private life. A rare photo and poster gallery is included, as well as a collectable movie poster insert, giving a flavor of the times to the viewer. As if that wasn't enough, a few Lugosi trailers are thrown in as is, as an extra bonus, ""Gasoline Cocktail,"" a radio drama starring none other than Bela himself. If you think his voice is exceptional in the movies, wait until you hear it on radio. Simply fabulous for Bela fans, and cinema fans in general.
I can only hope that Ted Newsom and Bela Lugosi, Jr. do not stop here. Having whetted our appetites with this feast for eyes and ears, we impatiently look forward to their next offering.",1046563200,9,2995,4.579143389199255
625045,2,6303307930,"This is volume 2 of the proposed 15 volume ""Bela Lugosi Presents"" series, which are presented by the Estate of Bela Lugosi himself. It is a step down from volume 1, ""The Devil Bat.""
For starters, ""Bowery at Midnight"" is a very bad movie. The only redeeming value in it is the presence of Bela Lugosi. The plot is boring and formulaic, the characters cardboard, and the acting never better than mediocre.
The damaged source print is made worse by a sub standard transfer, with signs of compression and flashing. The picture is sometimes too dark and blurry to make out, and along with the wavery sound, is little better than any public domain disc or video.
The extras are enjoyable, though. The most valuable is an old radio show in which Bela Lugosi made a guest appearance. He plays a deranged Pyromaniac named Nick. While not an excellent radio show by any means, it is definately an enjoyably guilty pleasure.
Next we have a commentary by Bela Lugosi Jr. and historian Ted Newsom. As in ""The Devil Bat,"" the two barely scratch the surface of the movie (they helpfully point out that it is not a Bowery Boys comedy), but some of the childhood memories Junior has are entertaining, and there's even a little info about Ed Wood!
The promised intro by Bela Lugosi Jr. is little more than an ad for the ""Bela Lugosi Presents"" series.
Rounding out the extras are the always reliable photo gallery, trailer collection, and movie poster insert.
Bottom line: poor film and transfer saved by extras.",1044403200,,1493,4.680608365019012
625046,2,6303307930,"This is the first Alpha Video DVD I have purchased and I must say, ""you get what you pay for.""  Yes, this DVD is cheap, but it isn't entirely worthless.  The source print for the DVD is from an Astor Pictures rerelease.  There are several scratches, but the picture is pretty clear.  The sound is not perfect, but typical of the Monogram pictures of the period.  There are some annoying splices that break some of the dialogue.
The film itself is probably in the middle of the pack of Lugosi's Monogram programmers.  Not the best, but certainly far superior to his two East Side Kids films.  Lugosi plays a man leading a double life, one a college professor and the other as a ruthless gangster.  Not really a true horror picture other than the drug addicted doctor that works for Lugosi.
Just a couple of more comments about Alpha Video.  There are no extras on this DVD and there are only 4 chapters (and they don't even cover the entire film!).  Also amusing is that the website listed on the back doesn't even take you to the Alpha Video website.  The one positive is that the artwork on the DVD is very nice and will make collectors take notice.",1024704000,10,1150,4.454545454545454

7843518,3,6303307930,"Bowery at Midnight, 1942 film

The opening scene shows men in prison. One prisoner tries to escape; shots are fired. But he finds a car for a getaway. Two tramps talk about free food at the Friendly Mission. One man has a hurt hand; will it be treated? Another man is offered a cigar (in a private room). Wagner recognizes Fingers. Im your friend. Another man enters the building by a back door and delivers a small bottle. Can they pull a job tonight? Yes. Fingers opens the safe; has he outlived his usefulness? [Short-sighted?] Karl uses a television to watch his flunkies! [A first for movies?] Karl returns home to his wife. How can he afford those expensive gifts? A jeweler gets a surprise in the morning! The police see a pattern: the body of an accomplice was found at each job. One sergeant hopes for a promotion.

A Professor teaches a class in college on Abnormal Psychology. One symptom is enjoying a life of crime. There are shots from another robbery! A policeman chases this robber. Will he get away? The policeman uses a call box. The robber goes to the Friendly Mission. [Does he look like a crook because he wears no tie?] Policemen arrive at the Mission to search for a dangerous killer! Karl offers a deal to Frankie. Good work, Frankie! Wagner shows his dirt cellar to Frankie. Just a derelict. Can he save Stratton? Richard wants Judy to give up her job at the Mission. She helps the underprivileged, social work. Frederick has a bad dream at night. Sgt. Crocker reports, turn in your shield! He will get a new one. Can people be distracted so a robber knocks over a jewelry store? Yes, at a cost. Ive been robbed yells the store owner. The police must produce results, or else! The Captain orders a search of the Bowery.

That student sees a man looking into a trash can. Is he down on his luck? Can he dress the part? Richard goes to the Mission as part of his research. Do his manners give him away? Is that Professor Brenner? He is doing research too. Richard goes into his office. Did he ever meet a homicidal maniac before? Does he enjoy taking a life? If they get in my way. You cant be serious. Mr. Dennison learns the hard way. His family reports him missing. The police will search the Mission. Judy visits the morgue and recognizes a face.

The police look for Professor Brenner at home. Why, thats Karl Wagner from the Bowery. The police become suspicious. Mrs. Brenner will be taken in for questioning. But she won't talk! Judy returns to the Mission, then is given a prescription. Is Judy too curious? She enters that dirt cellar! Will Frankie take care of Judy? A police car arrives with a load of policemen to search the Mission. Can Brenner escape? The doctor offers him a place to hide where no one will ever find him! That takes care of the professor. Richard tells Judy about their future. And so there is a happy ending for these two. But what about the others?

Aside from its low budget, its a fairly good story. Could a Professor lead a double life? [Like Moriarity in the Sherlock Holmes stories.] The word Bowery comes from the Dutch word for a farmland. Dave OBrien plays Pete Crawford the policeman, a change from his usual Western movies. Bela Lugosi plays a professor who has a hidden villainous side [a rle often found in the horror movies of that era]. [The double life of a professor recalls The Woman in the Window, a better story.]",1470873600,,3389,4.504065040650406

7843521,4,6303307930,"A bizarre movie featuring Bela Lugosi moonlighting as a kindly professor, a kindly soup kitchen owner, and a fiendish criminal mastermind who isn't afraid of killing (or having killed) anyone who gets in his way, including his poor unsuspecting wife given to wearing the jewelry he steals.  Things go according to plan until one of the professor's students (John Archer as Richard Dennison) goes undercover at the soup kitchen to find out what life is all about for the downtrodden.  He's quickly shown the secret room then the secret basement then the coldblooded killer Lugosi has working for him.  With the desired result (there's more than one way to flunk a student!).  As a sidebar, Lugosi has an inebriated mad doctor working for him.  Instead of burying all the people Lugosi has killed, the mad doctor puts them in a subbasement and does restoration work of some kind on them.  Just what that entails is never dealt with adequately (more's the pity).  At least Lugosi looks as if he had fun playing this role.  I certainly enjoyed watching it, even if it isn't one of his best vehicles.  It has the feel of something done hastily and without any attention to details.",1443052800,3,1176,4.782178217821782
