7771348,5,B01GWDC06A,"(Note: I am reviewing the Special Edition that shows two women sitting back to back and Colin Firth in the foreground on the right)
This is a great movie ... about 5 hours & 45 minutes worth. The cast was fantastic in their parts. My only complaint was in the last couple of minutes when it got a little too religious at the wedding (why did the writers do that after pretty much ignoring calls to God and Jesus during almost 6 hours of movie?). I skimmed the end of the book which didn't seem to contain that part.",1507766400,,515,4.212121212121212

I paid a higher price for this listing (versus others on Amazon) because I thought I was getting the edition shown in the picture.",1497139200,8,250,5.121951219512195
7771352,1,B01GWDC06A,"This edition is a big disappointment to me.  I also own the 6 episode boxed set, though unfortunately I lent it to someone and they never returned it.  I wanted to replace it, but the visual quality of this version to me is painful to watch.  I hope no one watching this disc thinks that the original looks like this.  It does not have the beautiful crisp clarity of the original.  It looks like what it is - 6 hours squeezed into a 2 disc set, and much of the second disc is special features.  Of course the cast and screenwriting are phenomenal.  I wish the people who enjoy this could see what it's really supposed to look like. I did enjoy the special features, but not at the cost of the poor quality of the rest of the DVD.",1496707200,5,729,4.164285714285715

8764235,5,B01GWDC06A,"The fault was mine. Therefore the remedy must be mine. - Darcy

The overriding theme is the moral basis of pride. An arrogant, selfish pride is offensive and wrong. This is how Darcy was perceived by Elizabeth upon first acquaintance. He was stiff, critical, unsmiling and well . . . rude.

What else could she think?

As Story proceeds, Elizabeth gradually sees somethings from Darcys eyes. Her silly sister, gossipy and self-centered mother give credence to Darcys aloofness. They deserve it.

Elizabeths prejudice, based on superficial, initial reaction, is shown to be just that - pre judgement - not careful discernment.

Darcy too, pre judging Elizabeths sister as unworthy for his friend Bingley. Darcy admits his prejudice and encourages Bingley to marry Jane.

Humility in action.

When Lydia runs away with a scoundrel, Wickham, who Darcy knew was wicked and nevertheless protected his reputation, Darcy feels responsible. Explains to her uncle . . .

The fault was mine. Therefore the remedy must be mine. I will accept no argument in this matter. I insist on doing my duty in this matter.

We find that tens of thousands of pounds are required to pay Wickhams debts - tradesmen, gambling, etc., etc..

Darcy also purchases a commission in the army for Wickham. Expensive. And does not wish anyone to know.

Elizabeth finds out and is deeply moved. This is not the action of a proud, arrogant aristocrat. This is the generosity of a caring gentleman.

So Darcys pride is the earned self-respect, the confidence of disciplined morality.

One precious scene is when Darcys aunt, prominent aristocrat, comes to Elizabeths house to berate, humiliate, condemn her. Why? Because she heard Elizabeth was engaged to Darcy.

Elizabeths firm, courageous, bold response enrages the old woman. Threatens to use all her power and influence to hurt Elizabeth.

Elizabeths answer . . .

I will not allow you or anyone else to control my life or make me give up my own decisions!

Great!

This is another example of pride that is proper, deserved and admirable. The old ladys pride is unearned, improper, selfish and repulsive.

The contrasts of the good, appealing and uplifting characters with the bad, repulsive and offensive ones makes for fascinating drama.

The personalitys are so vividly drawn, so quickly discernible, so colorfully presented, that our interest is captured and does not escape!

Another special aspect is the detailed presentation of the gentry culture in England. This is only just a few percent of the population. In no way can we imagine that Elizabeth and Darcy represent the ordinary people.

The problem of entail, the law that only male descendants can inherit the land, is a key difficulty for Elizabeths family of only daughters. They must marry well or sink out of their class.

The industrial revolution has just begun. The old aristocratic, feudal world is disappearing. You could see the story as showing the weakening of the power of the old aristocrats to keep the newer Gentry out of their class.

This rigid, controlling, class conscious, honour driven culture is clearly drawn. So completely different from today.

Obviously produced a lot of misery. However, so does our lax, self-centered, dishonorable world (maybe even more).

Wonderful presentation.

Wife and I watch yearly. This time shared with my twelve year old grandson.

Deserves ten stars!",1532908800,,3390,5.092391304347826

8764238,5,B01GWDC06A,"It took me a while to get around to watching this. I never saw it on TV, and had heard lots about it, but only recently purchased the DVD set. Even though this adaptation adds some elements that weren't in the original story, they only seem to fill in holes that make perfect sense for the most part. The wet shirt scene I'm not so sure about, but I'm sure the extreme reaction people have had to it is not exactly what was intended, and it does seem to kind of fit with the story. I had seen the old 1986 adaptation so many times before seeing this one, that Jennifer Ehle was hard for me to get used to as Elizabeth. But once I'd watched all the way through I realized she was an excellent choice, as was Colin Firth. The costumes, the settings, everything came together beautifully. Well done! I loved seeing Bingley and Darcy wear their arm-hats to the assembly. Great touch, as if I understand correctly that's what they would have worn to Almack's in London.",1521936000,4,964,4.361111111111111
