However, then it does nothing but keep re-showing those images.  There is a paucity of interviewed scholars.  Leonard Nimoy states that Ali Baba, Sinbad, and Aladdin are the most famous of the stories and then he summarizes each one.  Well, that ate up time!  The documentary asks many questions that it does not answer.  It's mentioned that linguist Richard Burton eroticized some tales, but the tales that include same-sex sexuality are never brought up.  This work presents itself as teaching something, but actually presents close to nothing.",1180656000,7,678,5.165137614678899
