8585300,5,B00CRGMZC6,"I also have the longer Chinese release of the film and have watched it three or four times now, maybe five. I cannot get tired of this film. Wong Kar Wai is an artist who sees his finished work in great detail and manipulates and controls every aspect of his medium to get the precise effect he envisions. I have watched a lot of his films (mostly because of an infatuation with Maggie Cheung from ""Dragon Inn"") and, in my humble opinion, this is his finest. To approach it as a kung fu flick is to miss its brilliance. Was it Lao Tzu who said, ""The five colors blind the eye. The five tones deafen the ear. The five flavors dull the taste.""? Such is the effect of modern American cinema on the appreciation of artistically made films like this one.",1408924800,,749,4.319148936170213
