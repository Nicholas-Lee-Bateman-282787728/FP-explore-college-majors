7872645,5,6304487959,"I have been a fan of the original Battle of the Planets tv series from the 70's, I thought the characters were fantastic. When I heard about the 90's  versions of the series, I was somewhat sceptical - how wrong I was!
I am  so impressed with the animation and plot of this series that I would not  hesitate to recommend it to G-Force/Battle of the Planets fans out there -  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED -
The overall plot seems to be slightly more  complex than previously, and I found it quite involving. The superb  animation greatly enhances the experience, especially during action  scenes... You can expect to find old characters in there too. 5 stars for  this excellent series!",966384000,3,685,4.603305785123967
