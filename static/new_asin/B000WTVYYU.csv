8225476,4,B000WTVYYU,"This was a good intro to stress, its impact on blood Pressure, and how to manage High Blood Pressure by controlling with  alternative-integrative medicine, diet, mediation, and Yoga.  My only issue was that the meditation pose is a tightly crossed-legged yoga position  on the floor.  Furthermore, It sounded like they asked  specifically for legs to be tight.  I  cannot imagine many  60 & 70 year olds being able to get themselves into that position. In fact, I doubt that even many 50 year olds could enter that seated pose. No alternative to the pose was offered. Usually fitness DVDs offer something like, ""If for some reason you cannot do this thing this way, then an option is to do it this other way.""  Although a lot of the general info here is contained  on line and in books, the DVD had great color, photography and scenery, which makes the meditation and yoga segments very enjoyable.",1363478400,3,897,4.7290322580645165
