7980193,5,B00008973X,"I think I have finally found a DVD that shows the diversity among Muslims, Muslim thought, and Muslim attitudes around the world.  This is an important DVD, in my opinion, because it shows a different face than that of the angry terrorist or anarchist usually shown on the TV nightly news.  Most of the world's 1.5 billion Muslims live life as quietly as the 2 billion Christians; their faith is equally as diverse.  Coming from the same Abrahamic faiths as Judaism and Christianity, Islam is an important and generally peaceful religion which has been hijacked by extremists in the public mind.  This wonderful DVD, jam-packed with beautiful photography and a well-documented commentary goes a long way in dispelling misconceptions and showing the diversity of Muslims around the world.  I give it five stars for its thoroughness, thoughtfulness, and the beauty of its photography.  Well worth the premium price.
I recommend this for classes on Religion, Comparative Religion, Islamic Studies, inter-faith church/mosque/synagogue groups, and anyone who is interested in getting a more in-depth look at the world's fastest growing religion.",1268092800,3,1140,5.340782122905028

7980195,3,B00008973X,"Beautiful story that touches base here and there around the world and unsurprizingly finds Muslims are people too with problems, and predictable variation in both practice and attitude toward other religions and the west. The film does not probe beneath the surface, clarify the belief system of Islam & whether that system is compatible with other belief systems, nor explore what the cumulative effect the religion of Islam may have on western civilization.

Strongly recommend Herb Meyer's ""The Siege of Western Civilization"" and ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" for those who desire to fathom the real issues that are past the politically correct aspects of probably most crucial topic of our time.",1166140800,6,706,5.192982456140351
7980196,4,B00008973X,"""Muslims"" is a 2002 documentary about the diverse ways of being a Muslim today. I've used excerpts from it in teaching world religions to undergraduates and high school students.

It consists mostly of stories of individual Muslims from around the world, including an Egyptian sheikh, an Iranian ayatollah, some Turkish students, a Turkish politician, a Malaysian obstetrician, a Malaysian woman seeking a divorce, several Nigerians, the principal of a Muslim school in the U.S., an African-American convert to Islam, and an advisor to the Iranian president. Along the way, the video addresses various issues in contemporary Islam, such as the fallout of Western colonialism in Muslim countries, Islamic law, women in Islam, Islamism, Islam and democracy, interpretation of the Qur'an, terrorism, and being a religious minority in the U.S.

7980197,4,B00008973X,"This is a good all around Dvd that shows Muslims all around the globe. My favorite part is where the black woman in the U.S. takes shahada and converts from being an alcohol drinking, late night clubbing, sick woman to a Muslim. There is something about a woman that covers her hair and body that makes here a more decent human being. We in America are lost. That is the majority of us. I used to be a lost soul until I found this great religion. It has the guidance that every human being can follow and be morally successful. No other religion including Christianity has the power to straighten an individual out like Islam. It is the answer to the problems, not a cause of them. It is being attacked, for the devil truth and will do anything to stop it from being heard. The devil prefers Christianity, where you can smoke crack, have unregulated sex, and drink alcohol and its ok because Jesus died for your sins. To find the truth in life takes deep thinking. Take a closer look at yourself and at the world around you and you will understand why people are coming in droves to the way of life called ISLAM.
