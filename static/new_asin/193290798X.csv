The internal experience of the spiritual practices among the people interviewed is gently underscored by sounds and music that help express what it might feel like to be present in these rather extraordinary encounters and experiences. Beautiful, unobtrusive cinematography and editing gently help the viewer see things from the internal perspective as well as onlooker. The lengthy interviews with the vivid personalities take some concentration but reap the reward of gaining insight into the uniquely Balinese view of their religion and the world it shapes.",1506729600,,681,5.5576923076923075
7801601,4,193290798X,"This is a riveting film about the sacred traditions of Bali. If you have enjoyed the articles we featured on the island in this issue of Hoop this film gives you the chance to see some of them enacted.

The film is the result of the director's long love affair with the island, which began in 1970 when he went to a remote village and became the first Westerner to live there, participating in temple ceremonies and learning to play the gamelan. Wiese recalls that `the longer he stayed, the more he realised that he was not really `seeing' the world where the Balinese lived.'

Returning to the island many times again during his life, the film finally got born, and follows his travels as he meets healers, ceremonialists and traditional Balinese artists, interviewing them and filming them as they perform both arts and ceremonies. Central to the film is the concept of trance - of letting the spirits through, whether in the shadow puppet performance, the masked dances, or during a healing.

I found some of the film's sound a little difficult at times - some interviews were filmed in big rooms with reverberation - and also found some of the English spoken by the Balinese being interviewed a little hard to follow here and there, but there are subtitles when things get too indecipherable. Visually the film is beautiful, and that and the fascinating information it contains make up more than adequately for any `boomy' location problems. Compulsive and thought-provoking viewing.

7801602,5,193290798X,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film on the big screen last fall, and found Michael Wiese an engaging on-screen guide into the subject matter.  There's an honesty to his fascination with the Balinese spirit world and the practices within the culture that alternately pay a nod of respect to it in everyday routine and surrender control to it completely on other occasions.

Joy, fear and wonder are all present, and Michael's easy narrative style explains without sensationalizing, allowing the subject matter to lead.  TALKING WITH SPIRITS is an outstanding effort and well worth the watch.",1336176000,,593,5.092783505154639
7801603,5,193290798X,"Michael Wiese has a particular genius for finding and showing advanced spiritual traditions and spiritual adepts. He first visited Bali in the 1970's and was led to a remote village by a Balinese friend.  The Balinese allowed him to participate in elaborate ceremonies, and he realized he did not really see the world as the Balinese saw it.

In Talking With Spirits he re-visits Bali, four decades later. The film includes sequences filmed in previous trips over the intervening 40 years. The result is a compelling, gentle narrative that honestly shows the Balinese spiritual traditions, and makes them accessible to outsiders.

A moving, beautiful and profoundly interesting film for anyone interested in Bali, or spiritual traditions.

PS: I first met Michael when he agreed to publish one of my books. I consider this film one of the delightful benefits of knowing him.",1335916800,,874,5.133802816901408
