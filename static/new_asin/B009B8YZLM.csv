8539349,5,B009B8YZLM,"Mr. Jason is ""perfek""  and this series is very funny-old time slapstick comedy and he always comes out smelling like a rose.",1432080000,,124,4.636363636363637
8539350,5,B009B8YZLM,"After seeing Jason in Only Fools and Horses, I couldn't quite see him in a slapstick comedy. But he pulls it off wonderfully. The show is joy to watch from beginning to end. He's come a long way since Open all Hours, another great British comedy.
Don't let the naysayers ruin it for you. One can enjoy diverse comedy that doesn't require deep thinking. Don't analyze it, just enjoy it.",1393286400,2,385,4.514285714285714
8539351,4,B009B8YZLM,"Good quality and good show, well worth watching this guy act the fool, even though it is sometimes obvious what wiull happen next, theis guy makes it funny.",1385942400,,156,4.607142857142857
8539352,2,B009B8YZLM,"Did not like this video, It makes the Royals protective service look bad.

The actors cannot act and the plots are not funny.",1368489600,,125,4.434782608695652
8539353,3,B009B8YZLM,"Rather silly premise but it did have an accurate review so I knew what I was buying.  If you want a light comedy, buy it.",1365552000,2,121,3.84
8539354,3,B009B8YZLM,"I like the cast, but the story was a little silly. I because they are usually excellentalways take a change on buying British film unseen",1358294400,2,137,4.52
8539355,3,B009B8YZLM,"I was a little disappointed with this show.  David Jason is a much better actor than he portrays in this series.  The supporting cast sees stiff too.  The timing is off, and the quick witted play is missing.  I hope if they continue this series that it gets a whole lot better.",1354406400,6,277,4.269230769230769
8539356,2,B009B8YZLM,"This is a lame attempt to recreate the Peter Sellers role of Clouseau in a different setting, the British office that protects the Queen of England.  The main character trips, blunders, slips, falls over, and generally makes an ass of himself.  What a shame that David Jason, now in his 70s, had to descend to the level of a boob to keep working.  The worst part: the series isn't funny.  Indeed, it's embarrassing.  Skip this and revisit the Pink Panther movies.  It's a world of difference.",1351814400,8,492,4.662790697674419
