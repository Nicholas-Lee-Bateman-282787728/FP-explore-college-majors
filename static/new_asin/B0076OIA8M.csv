5057798,2,B0076OIA8M,"Worth the price of admission? No, not really. While fix is a good & honest documentary, overly honest, it might as well have had nothing to do with Ministry at all. I found this to just be disappointing, not the documentary as much as the band in general. While honesty is a beautiful thing, its anything but gratifying to find out one of your favorite bands from when you were younger were just a bunch of rock-star a@#!@#e junkies. It's one thing to be aware of a band you love having drug issues, it's a whole other thing to watch them shoot up, and act like cliche junkies for 2 hours straight. I did always wonder what the hell happened to the band after Psalm 69, this pretty much explains it. What happens in these two hours? You watch Al strung out on heroin more times than i can count, you watch Al cover himself with oils to ward of evil spirits and force the other members of the band to wear talisman's, you watch Al buy various bulletproof vests claiming that stalkers are going to kill him, or rant about how ""people"" are out to get him, and you watch the band ramble on and on about nasty groupies and the things they do with them. The name is fitting though, ill give it that, Al's crippling drug addiction seems to be the major centerpiece of the movie, and you pretty much watch everyone in the band either join in, or turn the other way and just agree with everything Al either says or does. The major reason i was aggravated with this documentary was the fact that as a teen i felt Ministry's music said intelligent things, it almost felt like part of this movie's job was to discredit that, and show what a bunch of total creeps they actually are. Fix isn't necessarily a bad documentary, it just has little to do with Ministry as a band, and more to do with Ministry as Al Jourgenson, and the drug addiction that more or less killed ministry as a creative force. This is much more a rental than a buy, and i doubt many people will want to watch this more than once.",1335398400,34,1988,4.304
5057799,1,B0076OIA8M,"If your an old school Ministry fan and are expecting a cool doc & behind the scenes footage from the Mind tour then don't buy this! Wait until there's 500 used copies on Amazon and buy it for $1.00 or less! This is a documentary about the 1996 Sphinctour, the lamest era in Ministry's history. The footage and interviews are just plain & boring. With all the crazy hype that's been circulating over the past two years about this long awaited release, it's a HUGE let down. The only good thing about this DVD is the bonus audio disc, Paul Barkers ""Fix This!!!"" CD. Good work Paul! :)",1334966400,7,582,4.398148148148148

5057801,2,B0076OIA8M,"This thing is 93 minutes of nothing more than Al getting high and his behavior while high. It's not about Ministry as a band at all. It's more sad than entertaining.  This thing should have been a 10 minute bonus footage track on some Ministry Live DVD. 90minutes of Al Jourgensen high is boring.

The interviews with Ogre, David Yow, Maynard and others is interesting but there is very little of this in it.

Don't waste your time or money on this. Instead go buy/watch the LEMMY documentary. It IS worth watching.

5057818,3,B0076OIA8M,"Title sums it up. I've been a huge fan of Ministry's music for almost 30 years. That being said, no fan is obligated to be enamored with the band members themselves or their behaviors. People generally watch documentaries for information or entertainment, and FIX provides little of either. There's not much here most fans don't already know. As other reviews have mentioned, it's not so much an informative history or story as much as a brief time capsule of a seemingly pretty dark period in Al's life (1996-1997ish Sphinctour era?) which seem like disjointed flashbacks juxtaposed with modern interviews. These interviews are the better parts of the film, Trent Reznor, Ogre, and some other big scene names offer their reflections. The focus is very much on Al's addictions and spiraling out of control behavior. I purchased the DVD set directly from the Fix website to show my support, but I rather wish I would have just rented it. If gawking at trainwrecks is your thing, if you'd rather look at Al's dick than boobs, or if you're a 16 year old who has never seen someone shooting up heroin, you might find it very titillating and thrilling. For those of us who have seen and put up with addicts in our own lives, this production feels sad and meh, sort of like an episode of Intervention. On the upside, Al is reportedly clean and sober now. Well, clean, anyway. Looks like he just went back to rehab in February with a blood alcohol level of .33. He's an intelligent guy with a lot of great interviews - and his autobiography is highly recommended - but this movie is not his best showing. Maybe that's the point.",1400112000,,1621,4.671328671328672

5057837,5,B0076OIA8M,"Not sure what is with all the negative reviews here, must be a bunch of people who weren't aware of Ministry's drug problems during the late 1990s. It definitely is not for the faint of heart....

Anyways, this documentary focuses particularly on the factors that led Al Jourgensen to basically hit ""rock bottom"" during the late 90s, immediately after the band's surprising peak in popularity, after their tour for Psalm 69.
So, it is a very focused documentary and do not expect an over-reaching glimpse into the whole career of Ministry. FIX takes place during the tour for Filth Pig, and start of Dark Side of the Spoon, in the late 90s, so of course the director would be remiss to not focus on drug abuse, which caused major turmoil within the band during this period.

First off, I think Ministry was at their creative peak at this point, despite Al's inability to basically function as a human being, so it is interesting to hear bands such as The Jesus Lizard, NIN, Jane's Addiction, Skinny Puppy, and Jello Biafra share their perspective on what a lot of heavy bands were going through during the 90s (i.e. naive record labels, neo-cons drunk on power, etc.)

The envelopes were really being pushed in a bold manner, sometimes leading to to addiction problems, as in the case of Ministry. It is a total train-wreck, but that is what is so fascinating about it. Some dark humor in it too.

Yeah, I would have liked to have seen some candid tour footage of Ministry during the early 80s, but honestly, the Sphinctour was when Ministry hit a breaking point, for better or worse, so I'm glad someone documented it.

I compare FIX to the similar documentary on the Rolling Stones during the recording of Exile on Main Street, which was also plagued by addiction and serious band turmoil; hence, also a fascinating film.",1370390400,5,1823,4.702194357366771
5057838,4,B0076OIA8M,"The reason I got into Ministry some 25 years ago had something to do with their power, authenticity, and urgency.  After seeing FIX, I'm glad to know I was feeding off something that was real.  While this is not a film about Ministry per se, as in a biography or history, it was far better than I expected.  After reading the reviews, and the pretty lame book by Chris Connelly charting his time in Ministry, I expected Al to be just another junky with more dope than brains.

Al is an addict, ok.  Al is a character that knows only one speed, about 1000 miles per hour.  Ok.  But beneath all the stereotypical rock star posturing is one of the funniest, rant-obsessed SOBs out there.  He is pissed off, he is intelligent, he is troubled and he's real.  I don't see his addiction as much more than a symptom of whatever pain got him on the needle in the first place.  Getting past that, and focusing less on the many scenes of him cooking the spoon, I found a highly entertaining force of a personality.  He's got a ton to say and the intelligence to say it.

One of the interesting parts of the film is when Al talks about Air Force pilots that were using Ministry to get the adrenalin going before dropping bombs on Iraq in the first Gulf War.  On the one hand, he's flattered and on the other, seriously disturbed.  The fact he could stay with this inner conflict, as well as articulate the feelings, was impressive.  Like any powerful music, it can be used as a catalyst to liberate or destroy.  And more often than not, when powerful music hits the mainstream, it's going to be misunderstood and misused.

Like David Bowie, Jack Grisham of TSOL, or Henry Rollins, Al is a larger than life figure.  His output is music but he's the type of personality that is bigger than his craft.  He's totally uncompromising and that is far too rare in the world.  That is what makes him an artist.  That is what generates respect.  Like a benzene fire, Ministry was great, for a short time.  What separates them from the herd is, they were and will always be important.  They were not industrial in the Throbbing Gristle sense but they were industrial, no doubt.  Thankfully, they were industrial before the genre ceased to have any meaning at all.

If nothing else, FIX is a window into Al.  That alone makes it worth seeing because Al is worth the time.  I too wish I'd gotten to know more of Paul Barker.  Nevertheless, if you've liked Ministry because you felt a connection to their music, FIX will uncover that connection.  FIX is annoying, haphazard, and somewhat unfocused which I guess are the emotions one would feel in the first 15 minutes with Al.  Ultimately, it's rewarding all the same.",1363478400,9,2692,4.5
5057839,5,B0076OIA8M,"I pick up this item as I started listen to Ministry in 1995 and this dvd covers the touring period of this album - and the artistic partnership between Paul Barker and Al Jourgensen was so strong you could feel it even inside the album's songwriting.

Ministry were a mess - high and low moods, paranoia, drug taking, amulets and beliefs, grudge, laughing, drinking, travelling, speaking, disappointing and exalting the fans - all this from an objective point of view and interrupted here and there by interviews of people who knew the band during that period or were anyway influenced by them... David Yow of Jesus Lizard obtain the award for best naked man on stage ever: fighting Al's paranoia to being shot by someone, he goes up on stage naked, smoking a cigarette and giving the middle finger to the audience with such a nonchalance that is awesome.

Al shows to be a smart and humorous guy, as well as Paul... definitely, Ministry to me were dead after their break-up, as Barker is a class songwriter (and the tracks contained in the CD shows how good he still is and how his trademark signed the Ministry we all loved)... so it is a good dvd where memories came back, and if you were a fan of the band they were (and not of the imitation they become today, alas), it's a must-see.",1361577600,4,1288,4.523605150214593
5057840,5,B0076OIA8M,Not sure why there is so many 1 star reviews.  This movie is great and makes you feel like you're on a rock star tour bus.  I love it myself.,1358208000,,141,3.6666666666666665
5057851,3,B0076OIA8M,"Somewhat fascinating at times embarrasing at others, this collection of backstage footage of Al Jourgensen and the rest of Ministry anno 1996 being drunk and high, peppered with commentary from everything from people who toured with the band five years earlier to people who say they've never even met Jourgensen was a bit disappointing to me. To watch Jourgensen shoot up and/ or get drunk and make an uncharismatic moron of himself isn't all that interesting. I would much rather have seen a proper documentary about the golden days of Ministry 1988-1996 preferably with interviews with people actually involved with the band at the time such as Paul Barker, Chris Connelly, Willian Rieflin Mike Scaccia etc.
I'll give this 2 disc collector's edition one additional star for the included cd by Paul Barker which is surprisingly good. The songs sounds more like Ministry than Ministry and features both Chris Connelly and Nivek Ogre on vocals among others.",1355184000,5,957,5.101910828025478

5057853,2,B0076OIA8M,"As a Ministry fan who looked forward to this film, I am very disappointed. What exactly is this movie about? Drinking? Drugs? Life on the road? It's essentially 100 minutes of drunk, paranoid ramblings, drug abuse and nothingness. I did not walk away from this movie learning a thing. In fact, I feel bad for Al...the movie makes him look like a moron 99% of the time.

If you're a fan like me, seek out a free copy. Don't waste your hard-earned money on this. It's a pointless film...and that pains me to say it as a fan.",1347580800,3,522,4.326530612244898

5057855,5,B0076OIA8M,"Love Al...This is the best documentary of Ministry. Could not believe all of the bands which were depicted in this video. I honestly can say Al Jourgensen is the craziest the industry has, and he truly is a artist. He enjoys the audience. Also, I like the interviews with Maynard from tool. He seems very calm and down to earth, way different from what I've seen on stage. If you like Ministry, Tool, or NIN, you'll love this movie...",1340841600,2,434,4.506329113924051

5057859,3,B0076OIA8M,"I enjoyed Fix, but it really left me wanting more from it.  There wasn't enough input from Paul Barker.  Most of the footage was filmed on the 1997 Sphinctour, and although there are much more recent interviews included, none of the period between 1998 - 2009 (i think that's when the filming wrapped on the recent interviews) is really delved into at all.  There were a LOT of interesting things that happened with Ministry in the meantime, and some of their best work was released in that period, but none of it even mentioned.

This is more of a time capsule ""here's where Ministry was in 1997"" with some reflective interviews of friends and associates thrown in.  It's NOT a documentary about Ministry.  It doesn't cover the beginning, Wax Trax, the end of the WB years, the start of Al's own label, the departure of Paul Barker, the resurrection of Ministry as a powerful creative force after Al got sober ... none of the redemption that happened AFTER the truly awful behavior shown in Fix is included, so rather than being a story arc of a downward spiral and subsequent rebirth, it's just a cautionary tale of ""don't let this happen to you"" at the point where things really seemed to be getting out of hand with Mr. Jourgensen.

It really is more about Al and his personal demons around 1997 than anything else.  If you want to see that, then this is for you.  If you were looking for a comprehensive retrospective, documentary, etc, then this isn't it.  And someone really needs to make one of the latter.

I bought this directly from 13th Planet to support Al, his label, his music, etc.  I can't really say it's a great documentary, but it's certainly an interesting glimpse at the mind and machinations of a true musical iconoclast at a seemingly dark period in his life.

BTW, Ministry's new album, Relapse, is another decadent slice of grinding industrial metal that proves Al hasn't lost his edge, and that the world still needs people like him to push boundaries and explore the limits of ugly, aggressive, mechanized music.",1335744000,39,2040,4.680672268907563
5057860,3,B0076OIA8M,"I watched the doc and it is pretty much what I expected.  Al Jourgensen is paranoid as can be, he is superstitious, he has wild opinions and immature behavior.  He also shoots alot of dope.

I listened to an interview with Al on the Alex Jones show about Al's beliefs in society falling apart in 2012 and his beliefs that the world is run by Alien overlords and while these are his opinions and he is welcome to have them, the guy is definitely troubled.  I knew what he is like before watching the documentary and it didn't give me any new opinions of him.

There are chunks of the sphinctour dvd thrown in to fill a bit of time, as well as some footage from that tour that did not make it to the sphinctour DVD for good reason.  There are also brief interviews with some other Icons that I am very familiar with (Ohgr from skinny puppy, maynard from Tool, Trent from NIN, Lemmy from Motorhead) and some others who I am not as familiar with.  But Al and his antics are really the main focus of the show.  You'll see him ranting about groupies, pulling his pants down to show his butt or sticking his penis in a cooked chicken but he gives very little intelligent insight into himself, into drug abuse or into Ministry as a band or the music industry.  If it weren't for the other people being interviewed this documentary would be pretty lame because Al is quite obnoxious.  This documentary makes me glad that I am not like Al Jourgensen.  Most people would not want that lifestyle.

I watched it and it was a serious trainwreck, but that is why it was somewhat interesting.  Al is a trainwreck, but you want to watch, at least for a bit, but in the end you feel glad that you are not in the wreck.  I'm also glad that I rented it instead of buying it.  Unless you are truly obsessed with Al as a person and wish that you could live this lifestyle (I've known people who desperately want to be like this for some reason) then don't buy it, just rent it or borrow it because it probably won't be something that you will want to watch more than once.",1335571200,11,2050,4.274611398963731
