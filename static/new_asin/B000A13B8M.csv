8565504,5,B000A13B8M,"This is the story about the aftermath following the collapse of the World Trade Towers in New York. It tells of the bravery, not only of those directly involved, but also of the families who had to wait for them to return with news. There are a few graphic descriptions of human remains and the effects that has on team members, but also the shock effect from being told that in many cases there were no remains; he extraordinary heat that caused the buildings to disintegrate removed the evidence of human occupancy. It is an insight into the true meaning of what it is to be a firefighter.",1458950400,,591,4.481481481481482

The accounts of the aftermath of the 9-11 attacks are eye-opening and the bond between brothers, both the rescuers and the true brothers, is very real. Prepare to be saddened by the imagery. Must see for anyone interested with the events of 9-11.",1341705600,,288,4.8979591836734695

For those interested in him:  it only has his voice at the begining.  That's it.  So if you are interested in 9/11 this one is great.  If not don't bother.",1252886400,7,313,4.133333333333334
