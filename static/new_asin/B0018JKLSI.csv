8269838,5,B0018JKLSI,"In this concluding volume, ""Tweeny Witches"" closes with Arusu making peace with the dark witch in a courageous battle against an apocalypse.

""Tweeny Witches"" has really stretched the boundaries of fantasy anime with endangered fairy creatures and a war between old witches and technological warlocks. But with this volume, ""Tweeny Witches"" went far and beyond, with a desperate attempt to save the entire witch world from destruction.

But be warned--there are a few spoilers here. I won't make the biggest spoiler though.

First, viewers will discover Arusu's real mother and her relation to Arusu's mirror, Lennon. They will discover the real reason why Arusu's father disappeared.

Second, Arusu returns the magic book to Grande, the leader of the warlocks. However, he's not just a warlock--he's a demon hell-bent on destruction.

Finally, one of the witches is Grande's lynchpin in his plot to destroy the witch world. This is the most surprising twist that determines how the story will end. Without giving too much away, this witch wasn't able to cast magic in the beginning of the series. That desire turned to utter scorn for Arusu, who is the witch of light magic.

And Grande transforms into a gigantic monster, using Eva as his source of power. The end is a stunning display of imagery similar to the large-scale destruction in the Hayao Miyazaki film ""Princess Mononoke."" Arusu must appease the witch with her favorite food near the end.

This is a surprising series with an excellent story about a girl who seeks to help the people she loves in any way she can. Although Arusu is not like the godlike Nausicaa in ""Nausicaa: Valley of the Winds,"" she knows how to cheer people up. And this magic of love is what finally ends the ongoing battle between warlocks and witches, and saves the world.

Although I don't know where this may rank in other anime discussion boards, ""Tweeny Witches"" has one of the best anime stories to date. It somehow manages to show off ""Princess Mononoke's"" apocalyptic imagery and remain kid-friendly. In fact, the curse of eternal youth on Eva and Shiela actually helped them retain their hope. It's safe to say that this is a great anime for all ages. And this series is especially great for young girls.",1219881600,2,2248,4.897368421052631
