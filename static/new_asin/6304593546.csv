The production is not professional quality. At times, it was more like a high school show.",1519171200,,256,4.840909090909091
7874386,3,6304593546,"I do not believe most of the other critics really understand the mystery of having no alternatives to purchase Faust.  The opera Faust has a  very special meaning to me. I first viewed this opera by sneaking into a  small local theatre when I was in the Military service in Spring of 1951. There was a double  feature of Luchia de Lammermoor and Faust.  These were films with subtitles. Italo Tajo sang Satin in Faust.  These two operas eventually brought me into enjoying operas.  I contacted Kulter in 1990 to obtain a copy of Faust and they replied that the Family would not allow any reproductions to be made. Thus, I feel fortunate in having absolutely any copy that is attainable.  I have seen three versions including the
Japanese.  The initial black and white version of 1951 viewing was the best.  I now make my comments about the Alfredo Kraus  version.
I believe the singing was appropriate given the difficulties in making the video but was not appreciated by the lackluster applause by the audience in attendance. The staging and costumes were inappropriate for the environment of a simple village girl being seduced by Faust.  The sequencing and positioning of the soldiers returning from battle was a structured chorale presentation with no meaningful relationship related to the actual events that occurred as being presented in the opera. The possible evil gymnastics that Mephistopheles is capable of doing to show his power was missing as well as the reaction of the local gendarme in raising their swords to make the sign of the cross. The lack of a meaningful interpretation of a  night scene whereby Faust enjoys the favors of Venus and her companions is done very poorly by the ballet.  The ballet is completely inappropriate to the operatic venue and possesses no abstract meaning to the opera.
There is no mention of Faust having a vision of Marguerite  with a rope around her neck ready to be hanged.  Also, that she  did not kill the new born child on purpose but by accident and thus was innocent of the crime.  Alfredo Kraus did receive a long ovation for one of his arias .. The staging in the last scene could have even placed a simple set of vertical bars to symbolize a prison.  I am rating this production as three stars only because I am fortunate to have obtained any version. I do not believe the other critics have ever seen the Italo Tajo  film nor have they seen the Japanese
version .  They are most likely not aware the difficult circumstances in obtaining any version that may have been pirated?  .",1441411200,,2541,4.701357466063349
7874387,1,6304593546,"If I didn't know better, I would've thought that someone was playing a joke by presenting me with this remarkably awful--and musically and aesthetically disrespectful--production of Goethe's great opera, Faust.  But I purchased it, so there's no one to blame but myself.  I have long felt, and still do, that one can enjoy and learn about opera at home with very little cost by being selective, and taking advantage of the vast treasure trove of used videos or dvds available from Amazon or other internet sources.  But I goofed on this one;  I didn't heed the warnings of others about this production (it hardly deserves to be called a ""production"") with its very poor singing, 6th grade costumes,  extraordinarily incompetent filming, and horrible audio.  The mystery of course is what was going on with the late (and great)tenor, Alfredo Kraus, or why he consented to appear in this shameful video? And for fear of someone being thoroughly mislead about opera in general, and the achingly beautiful Faust--more specifically, I will toss this into the garbage rather than donating it to my local library's used book and audio store!",1161475200,,1134,5.00531914893617
7874388,1,6304593546,"The listing states Opera Faust with Alfredo Kraus,Mirella Freni & Nicolai Ghiaurov which I have seen and is exeptional. What I received is NOT the version listed. Kraus is the only one in this version which evidently is a DOG as seen by other reviews. If listed one were correct ,I would order. I have returned version received. This is the second time that I receive a misrepresented item. VHS movie ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" with Jose Ferrer (1950) was listed as ""colorized version"" ..received B&W version....NEVER did get a refund either.  Caveat emptor",1043884800,5,551,4.924731182795699
7874389,4,6304593546,"I was apprehensive about viewing this VHS after reading the review by Derek DeHaas, but was completely taken in by it for the very reasons he wasn't. I would loved to have seen this production. The sets & lighting were wonderful & created the atmosphere for this operatic tale of horror. The singing for the most part was quite good & the acting believable,in the tradition of Gedda, Kraus, Pinza & Cristoff. I didn't mind the Walpuris Night scene left out, as most time I cringe at the dreadful choreography of most opera ballets & realize that most composers of the time wrote them only because it was expected to have a ballet. I only hope that one day when Levine is gone we can have a great Faust at the Metropolitan Opera again.",1036713600,14,734,4.485074626865671
7874390,2,6304593546,"Although the quality of the tape (audio and video) was not completely horrendous, the conspicuous absence of english subtitles made it an indeed awkward viewing experience for me, a non-speaker of French.  The quality of the production was, in my opinion, very nice.  The sets and costumes were lavish, and the singing was exemplary.  However, the characterization of Marguerite as a Catholic nun made it very strange to say the least.  Also, during the overture a bizarre ballet is performed in which Faust uses Universal Studios-ish Frankenstein equipment to bring a dead girl back to life for a few moments.  Also disappointing was the omission of the Walpurgis night scene of the  opera.  I guess we'll just have to wait for Kultur video to put out a nice version of this opera on tape!!",1015804800,20,791,4.858208955223881
7874391,1,6304593546,This is a terrible tape..The tape is just about unwatchable...The quality is such that you can hardly make out the characters...The tape looks like it has been copied too many times...The sound quality isn't much  either...i'm suprised that Amazon would sell something of this poor quality,922320000,30,289,5.282608695652174
