As it happened, the Balkan area was very-important in the final defeat of Nazi forces, and the DVD and it's use of combat footage, is probably ""sui generis""/one-of-a-kind, in it's focus on a specific area of WW2 battles. .. This is a VERY-worthwhile DVD to own .. and it's part of the old ""Battlefield"" series.",1232150400,13,390,4.585714285714285

8245663,5,B0012EI8A2,SAome will bicker over the content but this is very informative and interesting,1446076800,,79,5.153846153846154

8245665,4,B0012EI8A2,"This sendup is part of the ""Battlefield"" series and as such is very well done. However, (there is usually an however, isn't there?) it substitutes a lot of other war information for actual testimony and evidence of the importance of the Balkans in this conflict. Possibly because the hatreds that have existed for the last couple of thousand years are yet alive and well in the present time. When commenting on the participation of the various combatants in this theater the text always has to refer to the divisions within the factions themselves and the obvious glee with which they so happily betray each other for their own political, religious or ethnic joy in slaughter. These machinations will again, no doubt, display themselves in gratuitous evil once again soon. Maybe the writers should take the courageous stand of calling the different sides into the court of judgement for their eternal guilt in these arenas and forego political correctness which is temporary at best ... sammy",1407974400,2,992,5.0181818181818185

8245667,4,B0012EI8A2,"Was good, but couldve left out some of the info not specific to the Balkan region. I understand giving us some background leading up to the campaign, just would be more interested in the details about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary & Yugoslavia's roles in the theatre.",1406505600,,264,4.888888888888889
8245668,5,B0012EI8A2,History that almost can't be traced without this kind of video.  Enjoyed the extreme detail of this side of the European campaign.,1405296000,,130,4.909090909090909
8245669,1,B0012EI8A2,"This DVD has little really to do with the Balkans.  It basically talks about what happened on the Eastern Front prior to the BATTLEFIELD: BATTLE OF BERLIN DVD.  Sad, really.  Very little information about the 1941 Balkans, Greek, or Crete campaigns, at all.",1401667200,4,257,4.930232558139535
8245670,4,B0012EI8A2,"The DVD is a survey of the course of the Second World War in the Balkans.  It's very civilian friendly.  A military man wouldn't be into it so much.  But, it's a must own for any one.  It's very good all around.  The DVD is a remarkable contribution in the area of adding to the understanding of some of the cultural impacts of World War II on Europe particularly the Balkans.  I think any civilian would really enjoy this video.",1375660800,,429,4.3
8245671,3,B0012EI8A2,"While there is some good film in this and some good information the presentation is rather disjointed, the program jumps back and forth in time rather than weaving the whole commentary in a way the makes chronological sense.",1254441600,4,224,4.921052631578948
8245672,5,B0012EI8A2,"Tha romanians changed sides in august 1944,not 1943 as specified in the product review section. Due to this change of sides,the war was shortened by at least 6 months,but credit was never given to the romanians for that historical about face. And no,they did not do it as suggested on this site,because of the heavy shelling-after all,the heaviest casualties suffered by the americans,sadly and regretfully,were in 1943 ,over the oil fields of Ploiesti-,but because it was the right,logical thing to do,and the will of the romanian people. If this turn of events would have never happened,the russian hordes would have had very tough times advancing towards Germany,fighting a desperate,but still lethal german army,and a highly motivated romanian army to defend their land,and also,the natural big obstacle of the Carpathian mountains.",1238371200,11,836,5.438461538461539
