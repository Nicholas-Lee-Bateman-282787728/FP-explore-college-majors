3739807,4,B001P6I14K,"This DVD wasn't quite what I was looking for. I've practiced Yoga for nearly 2 years and recently moved to a place where there are no yoga classes nearby. I was hoping, that with a few yoga DVD's I would have a fun way to mix up my daily yoga routine, while still following appropriate form. While Stacey stays true to many roots of Yoga, I found her voice rather intrusive. The moves are along the beginner lines of Yoga. Don't expect any thing challenging on this DVD if you have practiced in a studio. With that said, Stacey is well organized, and explains the moves very well. I would recommend this for those who are new to yoga and want to get their feet wet. My husband (who has never practiced yoga before) enjoyed the addition that this gave to his workout, without confusing him while he learned the moves.

Overall, a good quality DVD and high production quality. In the future I will look to see if Stacey has DVDs available for intermediate-advanced.",1232668800,,963,4.502857142857143
3739808,5,B001P6I14K,"Since I'm only just becoming a fan of yoga, I bought several new workouts to try and this was one of them.  It's fantastic and makes me enjoy yoga even more.  Stacy is a great instructor and makes this easy to follow.
This workout is very well cued and contains classic yoga poses.  You're supposed to be more energized by this and it helps to increase your flexibility and improve your strength.  There are modifications if you need them and so almost anyone could do this.  I especially love the relaxation segment at the end (there is also a bonus 'power yoga' segment too).
I really do think that you get better each time you perform yoga and I have noticed a slight difference already in my flexibility and posture.  I find this really relaxing especially at the end of a long hard day and I truly think that if you give this a go, you'll learn to enjoy yoga too.  It's not always easy at first, but it gets easier and you will be calmer in your day to day life and be able to deal with stress better too.  I love it.",1222387200,4,1022,4.231958762886598
3739809,5,B001P6I14K,"Let me just say that I personally know Stacy and she is by far one of the BEST instructors out there and, this dvd proves it!!! This dvd is a must have for anyone wanting a good workout PLUS great yoga instuction. Stacy, you've been an inspiration to me.

8332238,5,B001P6I14K,Very nice training video.  I recommend it.,1433289600,,42,5.0
8332239,4,B001P6I14K,"There are many things I like about this DVD. . . I can choose to do certain categories of poses (standing, back bends, etc. . . ) or do the whole routine.  I always feel great no matter how little or much I do.  The shorter, bonus segment for boosting metabolism is great - that would definitely get 5 stars.  However, I only give this DVD 4 stars because 1) I wish Stacy would use the common names for the poses (she does sometimes but not all the time) and 2) the music gets to be really annoying.  I wish I could turn it off, but I need to hear the verbal instructions.  I like this video better than the 2 I have from Rodney Yee. . . I think Stacy McCarthy deserves to be more popular but she needs some decent music & better marketing.  All in all, I'm glad I bought this & recommend it to beginners & experience yogis alike.",1406937600,,830,4.061349693251533
8332240,5,B001P6I14K,i first saw Stacy on Exercise TV.  her style of teaching is easy to follow without looking at the screen.  i enjoy the yoga session each time.,1403740800,,142,4.222222222222222
8332241,5,B001P6I14K,"I also discovered Stacy on my ""on demand"" fitness channel.  This is one of my favorite of Stacy's DVDs.  Gentle enough for a beginner but you will feel it the next day.  A great way to keep your practice going when you can't make a class or also my go-to DVD when I have taken some time off and need to ease my way back.  Highly recommended.  The instruction itself does have one mistake but I only notice it because I have done the DVD so many times...",1363132800,,453,4.1022727272727275
8332242,5,B001P6I14K,"I usually play the yoga and pilates videos on ON DEMAND and they had the video on there. I finally broke down and bought this. It is THE best yoga if you want to concentrate on breathing and stretching in the poses for longer than 2 seconds. Even though this is a long video, I still choose to do it when i'm sore...it really opens you up and makes the aches go away...I love it! And my husband does too!",1305590400,7,404,4.0625
8332243,5,B001P6I14K,"First off I just want to say that I've done all kinds of instructional Fitness videos. Tae Bo, Bender,Total Body Workout, you name it. I vowed to never do Yoga because it looked stupid to me, but after trying this on a whim I LOVE it and have found a greater appreciation for it. I must say  that I found Stacy to be the best Instructer I've seen. Not only does she explain the positions in a way that you can fully comprehend but she gives you a sense of stability in performing them. She makes you feel like you're doing just great even if you think you look like an idiot. She is friendly and welcoming. Now, I've purchased numerous items from amazon and I NEVER comment on any of them. The funny thing is I didn't even purchase this item from amazon (I saw it on IN DEMAND on TV) but after trying it I had to comment because its great!!!! STACY IS A SUPERHERO",1283385600,,863,4.167664670658683

8332245,5,B001P6I14K,"Over the last twenty years I have done a lot of at home videos and DVD's, this one is just wonderful.  Her instruction is clear and her voice is soothing.  She gives you alternate harder or easier poses with each pose.  It is a challenging workout, but isn't that why we workout. . .to be challenged",1240876800,3,299,4.303571428571429
