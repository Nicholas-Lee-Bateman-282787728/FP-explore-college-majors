3466309,5,B001ARDBYO,"Well, it was exactly what I was looking for! And exactly what I expected after reading the product description.  My son enjoyed watching real life construction and learning what goes on.  A little bit of familiar Bob and friends thrown in makes it very kid friendly and extra fun.  No, this is not a Bob the Builder episode. If a regular episode is what you are looking for, do not get the ""On Site"" dvd's.",1227052800,6,406,4.386666666666667
