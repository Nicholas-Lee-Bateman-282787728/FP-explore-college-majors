8328486,4,B001NZF1QY,"We watched this video in our spinning club.  The scenery is wonderful.  The production values are top-notch.  I like the camera's perspective and feeling as it follows the riders through the countryside.  The bike-cam is pretty cool.  I also really like the heads-up-display, showing the target heart zone, %grade, and ride profile.  Gives a lot of information without being distracting (way too many biking DVDs have highly animated info displays).

The music, though, is very repetitive.  We lasted about 10 minutes before we turned off the DVD player's music and piped in a workout set from iTunes.",1265673600,,601,5.123711340206185
8328487,5,B001NZF1QY,"I have purchased several cycling DVD's in the past to use for my indoor cycling class and Epic Vermont is definitely the best in my collection.  The production quality, scenery, and the overall, true road ride feel you get from it makes it stand out among the rest.",1235606400,,265,4.520833333333333
