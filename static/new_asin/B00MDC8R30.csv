6568091,4,B00MDC8R30,"I saw parts of the New Years Eve 2015 telecast on CNN with a very vulgar female comedian along with Anderson Cooper (who unsuccessfully tried to keep the show on a PG rated level).  You could flip channels and see Ryan Secrest on the Dick Clark's Rockin' New Years Eve Show, but It all made me long for the original Mr. New Years Eve--Guy Lombardo.  This dvd contains a rare film made from old kinescope recordings. The picture quality is marginal, but you're drawn to the 1957 show because of the wonderful music and the nostalgia of it all.  The audience is mostly of the Geritol crowd.  The show includes some live shots from Times Square with CBS Newsman Robert Trout as the ball drops to usher in the New Year of 1958. You might want to skip the Jack Benny show which is very grainy (shot on film and available elsewhere with much better picture quality). I still recommend the dvd for any Lombardo fan.  You'll want to play it over and over again!",1452297600,3,953,4.422857142857143
6568092,4,B00MDC8R30,"I was delighted with the Guy Lombardo New Years Eve Special recorded at the Roosevelt Hotel in 1957.  I last saw Mr. Lombardo on PBS during the New Year's Eve Special (1976-1977) at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel which is where most viewers would remember him.  The production, however, is very similar, and the inclusion of the Clairol ads in this recording lends itself to authenticity for that time.  Lawrence Welk always thought highly of Guy Lombardo, particularly his saxophone section and it is easy to see why - what a smooth sound though the other instruments also form an excellent blend.  Guy has been sorely missed since his passing in 1977 but thankfully we have CD's and this video gem to draw upon nostalgically when the urge arises.  I would have given this video 5 stars if the Jack Benny complementary feature had been one of his better shows but it will still bring a measure of enjoyment to most people.  My good friend Harry, a 93 year old WWII veteran whom I shared this video with was also delighted to see it and even enjoyed seeing the ads and the shot of Times Square with the dropping of the ball celebration.",1433721600,7,1131,4.601990049751244

6568094,5,B00MDC8R30,"This DVD does not deserve 5 stars because of the beautiful transfer from video to disc, or the beautiful color, or the classic songs and production. It deserves 5 stars because it is like being wrapped in a comfy blanket of memories from years gone by, and for giving us something to look at on New Year's Eve rather than the junk now being aired for the public. For years, we always watched Guy Lombardo on New Year's Eve to see in the new year, and we now have an alternative. And what nostalgia, watching the old commercials. The Jack Benny show was a lot of fun, and classic Benny.",1427932800,8,585,4.327272727272727

8671695,5,B00MDC8R30,"I remember back in the 60's on ""Laugh In"" Guy Lombardo said ""When I go I'm taking New Years Eve with me!""  Well New Years Eve is still here but Guy is gone, however this is the best way to relive Guy and his New Years magic!  A time capsule of the innocence of the fifties!",1486080000,,273,3.857142857142857

8671698,5,B00MDC8R30,As a tip - the New Year's countdown starts 45 minutes before midnight - if you want to time your celebrations to the minute! Can't abide by today's countdowns and nightmares such as Mariah! I'm a square - and Guy is a memory of my childhood and is still perfect way to bring it in.,1485043200,,281,4.127272727272727
