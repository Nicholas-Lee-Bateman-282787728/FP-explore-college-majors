361560,5,6301798740,"This is a very funny old style Jimmy Stewart comedy. Stewart is great as his usual droll self, being an imposed upon father, taking his kids to Maine for a summer vacation when everything goes wrong, including a very funny scene with an old type water pump not functioning. Maureen O'Hara is great as the mother, and, at 42, she is looking great. There is also a very funny and touching scene where Stewart gets lost on the ocean with his son in a small boat and they bond. Perhaps the best scenes are with Jimmy Stewart's daughter's in laws, played very nicely by John McGiver and Marie Wilson. The scene with Stewart doing the ""bird walk"" and almost causing an accident is hysterical. Some of the younger crowd might find this a bit dated but it is a wonderful old style comedy that still holds its own.",1120521600,3,805,4.445945945945946
361561,4,6301798740,"This is not a trip to Wally World but a rather pleasant look at that family summer vacation taken back in the 1960's without the ""dirty dancing"".  All in all an amiable movie, especially for fans of James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara.

Fans of Jack Webb's ""Dragnet""; keep an eye out for ""Blue Boy"".",1120435200,2,296,4.462962962962963
361562,4,6301798740,"This pleasant comedy may seem a bit on the dull side to modern audiences conditioned by R-rated gross-out fests (at least it's in color, for those so spoiled they lack the ability to get into a black and white story), but a nice nostalgia trip for  those longing for the ""simpler, more innocent"" times of the mid-twentieth century.  (I'm not an old fuddy-duddy chronologically, just in spirit.)
Stewart is your average Dad, taking above average Mom (Maureen O'Hara) and family to spend the summer in a rustic Victorian house at the beach.  They encounter the usual problems with antiquated plumbing and teenage romance, with a few interesting plot developments.  If you know character actor John McGiver, he has one of his funniest roles as a bird-watching executive.
Definitely recommended for Stewart fans or those interested in '50 & '60s nostalgia; but not for those who can only laugh at the stuff in Austin Powers or Team America (I like all these movies, incidentally).",1114300800,3,976,4.969325153374233
361563,5,6301798740,"I have seen this movie about ten times. Recently I recommended it to a friend who is going through a depression. It is guaranteed to bring one out of any doldrums. Why? Because it is soooo very
funny!
Scene after scene did in my funny bones. I laughed until my tummy ached. Marvelous are Stewart and O'Hara, but Marie Wilson(Remember ""My Friend, Irma"") and John McGiver are more than marvelous in their roles. They play a couple of 'supposed to be' tea totlers who are guests in the seaside, summer house rented by Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs played by Stewart and O'Hara. Wilson's steamy shower scene and McGiver's lessons in birdwatching are just about the funniest I have seen on screen in almost sixty years. I place this film with great comedies such as: ""The Egg and I."" and ""As Good As It Gets"" ""Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation"" IS as good as it ever gets.",1030665600,49,849,4.448717948717949
361564,5,6301798740,Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation and Harvey are two of the funniest Jimmy Stewart movies.  Vacation is especially fun because of the relationship between Maureen O'Hara and Jimmy.  You will not be disappointed with this movie.,1027036800,2,220,5.083333333333333
361565,5,6301798740,Jimmy Stewart plays a great role as an all American Dad who wants to enjoy a vacation with is family.  He is simply magic in this role and this could be the greatest comedic role he ever attempted.  I Love IT!,996278400,5,209,4.073170731707317
361566,4,6301798740,"I really like this movie. Stewart is perfectly cast, and his voice-overs  masterful in providing the ironic commentary on the events as they unfold.  The scenes between O'Hara and Stewart are flawless (""What did you tell  him I had? Dementia Praecox?"") -- you don't get to see sophisticated,  funny, and warmly affectionate parents in movies lately, and watching them  together is a pleasure. Not only are they real pros, but they are obviously  having fun together. I just wish that we could have seem more of them as  couple, and a lot less of the teenagers.
If you liked the movie you  might enjoy the book, too. The tone is similar, but lots of details are  different, and I found the humor a bit understated and the protagonist less  likable than Stewart's character.",962668800,21,772,4.7368421052631575

361671,2,6301798740,Enjoyed this somewhat. It's the usual kind of 1960's comedy. I liked watching James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara together. The chemistry is excellent between them.

361901,2,6301798740,"My guess is that the only people that like this movie are the ones who actually saw it released in 1962 because I don't understand the positive reviews for this movie. I am a big fan of both Maureen O'Hara and Jimmy Stewart and rarely find a movie of theirs I don't like but I am being generous by giving this movie two stars. There did not seem to be a real plot to the movie other than looking at a dysfunctional family's summer vacation. If you are looking for a good movie by either of the main stars I recommend Harvey, It's a Wonderful Life, Parent Trap or even The Quiet Man but would not recommend you waste your time on this one.",1484524800,,638,4.153225806451613

361964,5,6301798740,"I saw this on tv once and on dvd, too, but when I saw how cheap the vhs was, I decided to order it and watch it again. I loved this movie. Roger Hobbs is an overworked man who doesn't want to take a vacation, knowing he'll need another one just to get over the first. His daughter Katey has just got braces and is very insecure. His grown daughters now have their own children and let them run wild instead of punishing them or even yelling at him, which drives roger insane. His son is TV obsessed and his wife is loving and just kind of goes along for the ride. The family does take the vacation, and everything goes wrong. His son is holed up in his room with his tv, his daughter is too self conscious to go anywhere, the grandkids are little nightmares, and then...things change. Some things don't, but some things do...and in the best ways. Roger may not have a blast on his vacation, but we sure do. the movie is funny, sweet, and trust me, most of us have had problems or at least a vacation like this.",1478217600,5,1010,4.184615384615385

DH sat and watched it with me..and he laughed, and giggled, and enjoyed it.  Maybe not as much as I did but it was a great movie.  Jimmy Stewart, Maureen O'Hara and of course, Fabien or is it Fabian?  I loved it, but I'll never pay to watch another movie again.

A delightful family movie for the whole family, the way movies use to be made for all ages to learn something. This may be a old movie, but, teenagers can still learn something about how to met each other and just have fun instead of just jumping in bed. That's not the only way of learning about each other. Married people can also learn a lot from this movie. This shows, that a family stays together and helps each other no matter What!!",1457136000,6,569,4.327102803738318

A St. Louis family man and bank executive who is roped into spending his four week vacation with his extended family in a run down beach house in California. He finds himself having to deal with the various problems of his two grown daughters with families of their own, a teenage daughter with boy troubles and a pre-teen son who is addicted to television. His wife, played by Maureen O'Hara, who put this whole trip together, soon learns that everything isn't turning out as wonderful as she hoped it would. Still, this is a good movie with gentle humor and a positive message about family that is sorely missed today.",1444435200,2,794,4.598591549295775

Mom surprises him by getting a beach house that resembled the Adams Family home and gathers all the crew for the month.  This is a decent comedy, but not for the whole family.

362792,4,6301798740,"I recall the 1960s habit by Hollywood of anytime anyone used a ""cussword"" (not to be confused with a ""dirty word"" as used by today's gangsta rappers on FM radio), it gets edited out of a version that might wind up on TV. Case in point--there's one scene where Hobbs (Stewart) gets angry, causing his bratty grandkids to start whining. Mommy promptly soothes them; ""Boompa (Grandpa?) didn't mean it."" And Hobbs insists; ""Boompa meant every d*** word of it."" The TV version has Hobbs saying instead; ""Yes, Boompa DID mean it."" Something I wouldn't have noticed had I not first seen it in the theaters a few years beforehand. Contrast that with the scene where the Finnish maid Brenda (a Finnish woman with a Scottish name?) angrily quits because of the recent discord in the household, getting the ""last word"" with Hobbs by declaring; ""And in Finland, man do not svear at voman!"" After she's out of the room, Mrs. Hobbs (O'Hara) says; ""You didn't really swear at her, did you?"". Hobbs protests; ""Why, I haven't said a word to her today at all. The only thing I've said to anyone today was when I suggested to the kids that they get some sun on the beach..."" (his delivery in those last few words fizzles out as it strikes him what the phrase also sounds like). And that one still made it uncut to Prime Time. Another feature in the film is the occasional ""second part"" of voice-over narrator that Stewart plays throughout the film, such as a scene where Hobbs and one of the kids get lost in the fog while out in the boat.",1421020800,2,1520,4.510869565217392

362955,4,6301798740,"I spend a really nice, relaxing moment watching this 1962 comedy - even if it is not a great masterpiece, I liked it A LOT! Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is the story of Roger Hobbs (James Stewart), an overworked banker and father of four, aged 50+, who once wanted to spend nice, relaxing holidays with just his wife of many years and a copy of ""War and Peace"". But as his wife Peggy (Maureen O'Hara) invited the whole family (two married older daughters, their husbands and their children as well as two younger children and her Finnish cook) to come as well, expectations for nice relaxing holidays were greatly reduced. Then, once in place, Mr Hobbs and his tribe discovered THE HOUSE... And later things just went from bad to worse...)))

Well, we all saw many films on the topic ""Holidays in hell"" in which the father is usually the one who takes the worse hits - but the charm of this particular one is that it is gentle, warm and soothing, even when the pater familias is put through all kind of ordeals, some of them quite... extraordinary...))) Unlike in more modern things, there is nothing mean, vulgar or dirty in this film. Even when some obnoxious, unsufferable characters appear, they actually provide us with more laughs - and I for one, when watching them, I felt more amusement (and a little bit of pity) than anything else...

James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara are just perfect as a married couple who with time became a PERFECT team. His olympic calm, quite confident competence and sardonic sense of humour and her gentle but firm bossyness and also soooo feminine wiles are a pleasure to watch - because it is clear from the first moment that those two people love one another dearly and that they also love their wonderful/horrible children (and even more wonderful/horrible grandchildren) even more and would do anything for them. And they will actually have to do a lot...)))

Aging Finnish cook Brenda, sluttish brainless gold digger Marika, a very peculiar plumber and the even more peculiar plumbing of THE HOUSE provide many discreet, but nice gags. John Saxon and Fabian play minor, but important roles and they are very good.

The whole film ends very well, with all troubles and problems more or less solved - sometimes quite unexpectedly...

I watched this film after a very hard day at the office and with help of just one beer I had GREAT TIME and it cheered me up no end. A recommended viewing if you need a heart-warming nice little comedy with good actors, clever but gentle gags and a great lesson in love. ENJOY!",1415664000,,2587,4.687224669603524

He obligingly did so and it has been a favorite ever since. Jimmy Stewart plays Mr. Hobbs (nicknamed Boompa), a gruff, curmudgeon but one who is always willing to step in and help when his family needs him. In one humorous scene, he is enlisted to help his son-in-law win over a potential employer who comes to stay at the decrepit vacation home on the beach (filmed near Malibu) where Mr. Hobbs, wife Peggy (played by Maureen OHara) and family are staying. The employer, Mr. Turner, (John McGiver) is an avid bird watcher and Mr. Hobbs tries to be entertaining as he spends endless hours looking for an elusive rare bird, only to see barn swallows. The movie is based on a novel written by Edward Street, who also wrote another classic favorite, Father of the Bride.

Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation is a superior example of that all-but forgotten genre: the family comedy - a film both aimed at the whole family but also taking aim at the whole notion of family togetherness, even if it's not loaded for bear. Easing into the grandpa stage of his career, James Stewart is the centre of the storm, the grumpy family man who finds his wife (Maureen O'Hara) has taken a house on the coast with the idea of not only taking their two youngest children with them but also their two married daughters and their husbands. Naturally it's a recipe for disaster - the house looks like Norman Bates was renting rooms and nobody's bothered to clean it since he went away to that nice hospital, the Heath Robinson-style generator becomes Stewart's mortal enemy, his youngest daughter (Lauri Peters) won't leave the house because she's too embarrassed about her braces and his youngest son (Michael Burns) takes the TV on vacation with him so he doesn't have to see the family, one of the grandchildren hates Stewart so much he throws things at him whenever he sees him, one husband (Josh Peine) storms off after a row while the other (John Saxon's smug professor) takes an interest in Valerie Varda's glamorous neighbor, Reginald Gardiner's yacht club bigwig takes a shine to O'Hara and they find themselves having to accommodate Peine's prospective employer, the puritanically uninteresting bird-watching teetotaller John McGiver and his wife Marie Wilson as well... the usual family holiday nightmares that make the grownups count the days until they can get back to the safety of work.

Naturally everything eventually works out just as you expect it will, even if Stewart has to tell a few lies or bribe Fabian to date Peters, but there's a lot of fun to be had along the way. Like most vacations, it takes its time to get into the swing of things, and it's more an accumulation of gentle smiles and good humour than belly laughs, at least until McGiver memorably teaches Stewart the fundamentals of birdwatching in the film's funniest setpiece. But it's as sincerely likeable as many of Stewart's frustrations are all too recognisable from real life, keeping things for the most part focussed on sweating the small stuff to the maximum effect. It's well crafted by old studio hands like screenwriter Nunnally Johnson and director Henry Koster (who worked with Stewart on Harvey), with an easygoing score by Henry Mancini that initially takes its cue from Alain Roman's memorable theme for M. Hulot's Vacances before going off on its own direction.

Jimmy Stewart was perfect as the dad and Maureen O'Hara is his wife.  Mrs. Hobbs has arranged for the entire Hobbs clan, two children still at home and two adult daughters with husbands and children, to take a beachside vacation.  This is funny, warm and touching all at the same time.  The scene in the ""big bathroom"" is a real classic.  One of my favorite things in the film is a running gag involving a ""party line"".

Jimmy Stewart is simply superb as wound-up Missouri banker Hobbs, looking forward to a month-long vacation alone with his wife (played by the ever-superb and gorgeous Maureen O'Hara). MRS. Hobbs has other ideas (ie--to have a ""family"" vacation--including kids and grandkids). They are offered a ""gorgeous beachfront cottage"" by friends, sight unseen, and end up with (as Hobbs says) ""Edgar Allen Poe's old house"".
---The scenes involving the water pump had me in stitches, as did the ghoulish women who share the cottage's ""party line"" phone---and, in my opinion, character actress Marie Wilson steals the film in her bathroom scene with Jimmy Stewart---I laughed until I cried!

363824,5,6301798740,"Before I watched the Special Features that came with this DVD I thought how similar this movie was to Father of the Bride: father driven slightly insane by the rapid changes in his family. I could even picture Steve Martin in the role of Mr. Hobbs, if the powers that be ever did a remake (as they so often do with classics). Low and behold, Edward Streeter, author of Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation is also the author of Father of the Bride. There were definite similarities between the two stories.

If you love the classic (and not so classic remake) of Father of the Bride, you will love Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation. James Stewart is endearing in his role of a father trying to re-connect with his growing family and by extension his  sons-in-law, who he neither knows very well or doesn't particularly care for. Maureen O'Hara is simply stunning. The rest of the actors I didn't know at all, except for Fabian, who was from my mother's generation and she used to go nuts over him. Fabian has a minor role in the film as the youngest daughter's love interest. He goes from clean-cut young man to bearded beatnik for some unexplained reason, but he is still pretty cute.

There are certain adult themes, but nothing graphic or immoral. I did object to Mr. Hobbs saying the only thing his son Danny (who is roughly fourteen) needs from him is picking up an issue of Playboy magazine every month. But, maybe  the content was more a gentleman's magazine back in those days. I wouldn't really know, since I don't subscribe to that kind of magazine anyway! But, it seems certain reviewers were offended by the remark.

This movie also reminded me of Summer Rental, the John Hughes film with John Candy. Candy, in the role of an over-worked father on the brink of a nervous breakdown, rents a beach house for relaxation, but experiences anything but.

While I personally enjoyed this movie and laughed out loud at the antics (even the old dilapidated house the family rents is a character in this movie), I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for the good, clean fun of a Disney movie, or Annette Funicello in Beach Blanket Bingo, or Gidget, for that matter. Just because it is an older film does not make the theme suitable for everyone. Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation plays more like the adult comedies of the sixties (e.g., Pillow Talk, or the Odd Couple).

The cover art is what initially grabbed me. Mr. Hobbs is shown on the beach reading War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. I was reading that book myself at the time, and it was strongly on my mind. Also, I loved the literary references throughout the movie: Lolita (Nabokov), Dragonwyk (Seton), and The Brothers Karamazov (Dostoyevsky, which I am currently reading).

If you like old-fashioned comedy, that is ever-so slightly suggestive, then I recommend Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation.",1346630400,,2830,4.657314629258517

363973,4,6301798740,"Synopsis
 Mr. Hobbes (James Stewart) has planned a small family outing with his wife (Maureen O'Hara) and teenage son, but things quickly grow bigger than he had planned when his wife invites his grown up daughters, son-in-law's, and grandchildren along as well.  Leaky plumbing is the least of the problems that are caused.
Sexual Content
 A woman spends most of the film scantily clad in a bikini and other bathing suits (when she is first seen, she had the back to her bikini undone).  Whether innocent or not, the woman makes many overtures to Mr. Hobbes and his son-in-law.  Mr. Hobbes laughs it off, but his son-in-law apparently does not (it is possible that the two have an affair).  Mr. Hobbes manages to save his daughter's marriage, but not before some infidelity (of the heart, at least) takes place.  When his other son-in-law's boss comes to visit, Mr. Hobbes accidentally finds himself locked in a bathroom with the man's drunk wife.  She is nude (we don't see ANY private areas), but not very attractive.  Mr. Hobbes mentions buying playboy magazines for his teenage son.
Violence
 A few fist-fights which end after a punch or two.  Some comic pratfalls.
Language
 A few semi-dirty jokes that will probably pass over the little kids heads.  A few scattered d-words and h-words.
Morales
 Mr. Hobbes drinks and smokes, but is never shown getting drunk.  He is faithful to his wife and gets slightly jealous when he is not as sure of her faithfulness.  His parental style is loving, but not very effective.  He is willing to lie to get out of problems.  His son is obsessed with television, but Mr. Hobbes goes out of his way to get his son interested in other things.  His daughter's marriages both are slightly troubled, but as the film goes on, the problem's are worked out.
Conclusion
Mr. Hobbes Takes a Vacation is a lot of fun.  No one can deny that.  James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara are hilarious to watch in their middle years, and the antics of their children and grandchildren are equally hilarious.  However, what would be a great family film is marred by some troubling content.  Hobbes is no classic because it lacks the family values of Little House on the Prairie or even Yours, Mine, and Ours.
A fun little movie, but not a must-see.  Probably won't be too troubling for most kids if you choose to let them see it.",1266624000,6,2344,4.688725490196078

  There is some criticism from others regarding Fabian.  I always found him irresistably cute.  I don't mind his scenes.  Not even the one in the pizza parlor.  John McGiver and Marie Wilson add a touch of lunacy.

364007,5,6301798740,"Our collection of classics would be nowhere if we did not include the jewels provided by Jimmy Stuart, one of the most charismatic stars of the 20th Century.

Born May 20th, 1908, James Maitland Stewart lived for 89 years, providing the world with an acting style that captured the hearts of millions of Americans and the world at large. Nominated for several Academy Awards, Jimmy Steward won one and a Lifetime Achievement Award. Some of the unforgettable works include; Mr. Smith goes to Washington, Harvey, It's a wonderful life and Vertigo.

If you collect the best movies of all times you will realize that Jimmy Stewart appears in many of them, staring in comedies, westerns, mysteries but always acting in films that the entire family can watch.

He worked with many famous directors but our favorite is when he worked with Alfred Hitchcock.

In this film, we see Jimmy Steward with a great cast: Maureen O'Hara playing his wife, Fabian, John Saxon and Marie Wilson among others. The movie starts by his writing a letter to his wife to let her know that the vacation they just took will never take place again and as he writes, the story opens to surface a wife that wants to take her family on a vacation and she has received the chance to use a friends house for the summer.

When they arrive, the house is in such disrepair that it almost looks haunted and the fun starts as the kids, spoiled by the comforts of the city start to have to deal in an environment where much is missing... even running water.

Some of the lines are rather cute, such as the lady that takes care of cooking leaving the family because Jimmy Stewart was ""swearing."" The couple stares at each other in disbelief because he never does and he says: What did I say this morning? I only asked my daughter to go with me to take some ""sun by the beach."" And at this, both become hysterical because the foreign help understood... SOB.

If you want clean comedy, a view to simpler times, and great performances, this movie is highly recommended. Don't miss it!!!",1228176000,2,2041,4.59065934065934

It is a timeless tale of family and the good times that can result when one takes vacations within the parents. It also is a tale of a father's effort to understand their children, and the difficulties that can involve. So the movie is good couple of hours.

364037,5,6301798740,"This movie is a classic gem.

It's about a vacation lead by a father (Stewart) who is very much against taking the whole family which includes two adult daughters and their families, a young self-conscious daughter with braces, and a son who's a TV junkie.  The mother (O'Hara) convinces him to go.

At first, Stewart is very disconnected from all the family members (except his wife) but as the movie goes on he gets closer to each child.  The things he goes through to get to that point are great humor.

My favorite part of the movie is when the Turners show up to stay for a few days.  This couple is into nothing since neither person wants to do anything the other doesn't want to do.  It looks like they're going to be a couple of duds but they both end up being some of the comedic highlights of the movie.

I wanted to add another one, so that I could update one thing - I just got my DVD here from Amazon this May/2007, and it is indeed Widescreen Version!  I am delighted at that.  Was not sure it would be from what I could read on it here, but it came Widescreen. My favorite scene is the sailboating.  It is so comical to see Mr. Hobbs son enjoying the near misses (boat accidents) and being completely oblivious to his Dad's fright when steering between them - the look on Jimmy Stewart's face and eyes is classic. Maureen O'Hara is lovely as in all her movies. John McGiver is a hoot, especially on the bird watching extraveganza!  I believe I remember him in ""Man's Favorite Sport"", where he was Rock Hudson's boss in that movie.  Such a great sense of straight-faced comedy... I like McGiver.  Fabian is also very good in this ... I remember him best from his role with John Wayne in North to Alaska.  Well ... in that movie I guess I remember Capucine the best, but I digress.  Back to this movie. From the moment Mr. Hobbs and family arrive at the worn down beach house the fun begins.  The pump which supplies water to the house supplies fun of its own.  I'm a huge Jimmy Stewart fan for all of his movies, and this one is no different.  His delivery and timing is perfectly suited, and he plays well across from Maureen O'hara.  Last...

I found this to be somewhat of an awkward blend of 50's innocence and 60's ""not so innocence."" There were a couple of allusions to more adult themes, but these were packaged up with a pretty bow in an early family ""vacation"" movie.

Setting aside some of the very real-life frustrations, there are some genuinely funny parts. When Mr. Hobbs was on his ""bird spotting"" adventure, I couldn't stop laughing!

Overall, I would not say there are oodles of laugh-out-loud places, but there are enough amusing places that this becomes an enjoyable comedy.",1163376000,2,698,4.8
364086,5,6301798740,"Mr. Hobbs (Jimmy Stewart) plans a quiet enjoyable beachside holiday for his family.  He anticipates being able to read War and Peace during his afternoons in the sun.  But what he gets is .... a house that looks like it could belong to the Addams family, rebellious children (a son wedded to the TV and a daughter convinced she is the ultimate wallflower), a housekeeper who does not speak any English, a party line occupied by an endless conversation dealing with medical problems (""Her gall bladder was AS BIG AS a WATERMELON!""), a daughter going through marital difficulties, a son-in-law out of work, a strange water pump, a very sexy neighbor and the guests from hell (John McGiver and Joan).  All this, combined with Stewart's droll third-person narration (""Mr. Hobbs gravely surveyed the scene.""), make a great view of the American vacation.

Everyone has had vacations so bad that they become the lifeblood of all future family storytimes - and the times that you remember with the greatest fondness.  This vacation is that for the Hobbs family.  Each member receives some unexpected gift from the vacation, and Stewart comes to a truce with the plumbing and destroys his post-vacation dictated memo detailing the disasters.

One of the highlights of the film is the bird-watching sequence with McGiver and Stewart.  McGiver adopts a perculiar walk that he forces on Stewart's much-taller frame.  So you have Stewart doing a deep-knee bend walk and identifying barn swallows over and over again.  Right up there with Basil Fawlty's goose step!",1161216000,2,1551,5.0234375

But who cares?  Jimmy Stewart is at his comic best... Just his facial expressions when confronted with ""Marika"" are worth the price of admission.

I have to admit movies I saw as a child often conjure up nostalgia, I loved going to the movies when I was young (initially brought by parents, later going with school friends).  So I may be guilty of over-rating this.  However, I bought the dvd and rewatched it happily.  James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara rent a ramshackle house on the ocean -- which reminded me of a house my parents rented on Long Beach Island, part of my ongoing identification with the film (sorry) -- and they bring their teenage daughter who doesn't want to be there, and their tv-addicted son.  And then their grown children show up, all with marriage and children problems.  Stewart is in his patented semi-annoyed, semi-willing comic mode; and pretty Maureen O'Hara is a pleasingly idealized wife and mother, attentive, sympathetic and calm.  I'm making it sound dull... sorry.  It's actually funny.

Stewart has entertaining ""Walter Mitty-like"", in-his-head narration as he details his dire feelings as he deals with the boiler blowing up or with a badly behaved grandchild who has taken a hatred to him.  And there is a very funny visting-couple-from-hell (Marie Wilson and John McGiver) who show up and overstay their welcome, teetotalers until the last night when she goes drunk/seductive and he goes drunk/homicidal.  The teenage daughter (Lauri Peters, who I think played Liesel on stage in ""Sound of Music"") is taken to a painful dance where she can't meet anybody, until Stewart, feeling bad for her but being practical, starts to pay young men to go dance with her.  It ends up working out well, actually, since one of the guys, played by Fabian, actually likes her, and she comes out of her shell.

There is a crisis at every turn, dealing with misbehaving grandchildren, an unhappy teenager, a television addict son or trying to entertain two important, but very boring guests.

It is not a family movie.  Mr. Hobbs let off a number of swear words, there were a number of ""adult themes"" including divorce and infidelity which were the bulk of the movie.  In addition, the movie was very slow.  If you are a Jimmy Stewart fan, you might enjoy, but otherwise, I'd recommend other choices.",1156291200,16,476,4.363636363636363

Jimmy Stewart, one of the best actors of all time, Maureen O'Hara, one of the best actresses of all time lead a cast of fun characters on the ultimate family vacation gone wrong. Only not everything goes wrong. THere is a perfect mix of comedy and drama here, and the acting is top notch. It is nice to see how one by one, Mr. Hobbs wins his family members and potential employers hearts over with his charm...the reason, he never gives up on them. The music is good, the picture quality has been restord and is beautiful, and it brings back memories of sitting by the beach with my grandparents. There is absolutely nothing bad about this movie. The humor is such that it will appeal to all ages, and it brings us back to the thing that matters the most: our families. If I could give it 100 stars, that probably wouldnt be enough...well worth the money, a steal at only 10 dollars.",1152921600,3,903,4.380952380952381

364098,4,6301798740,"Most everyone will have memories of a vacation gone wrong. Usually, looking back with hindsight, we can see humorous events in the experience. Thankfully, in this film, we get to laugh at someone else's problems. The situations are tame by today's standards but that doesn't mean that they do not still work. They work mainly because Jimmy Stewart and Maureen O'Hara make them work.

The family is from St. Louis. They have two married daughters, a teenage daughter and a preteen son. Mom decides that instead of a romatic getaway vacation, they will rent a coast house in California and have a family reunion. Anyone who has ever had a vacation or a family can see trouble brewing.

Non of the problems is insoluble or even uncommon. The son spends too much time in front of the TV. The younger daughter has braces and is insecure. What's worse is that she becomes popular with the boys (after an initial bribe from Dad). One of the older daughters is married to a guy out of work and the other one is married to a pretentious would be philanderer. The neighbor is a goldigger and the plubming is in really bad shape. Its lots of fun and it is kind. That is something all too lacking in many modern films.

It's a winner.",1131926400,10,1222,4.520361990950226

364102,5,6301798740,"""Mr. Hobbs Takes A Vacation"" is one of the most enjoyable family films ever made. When it was released back in 1962, it was a big hit. But if you are a sophisticate, don't write it off just yet. The plot is simple: Harried St. Louis banker Roger Hobbs (James Stewart) is looking forward to a quiet, romantic vacation with his wife Peggy (Maureen O'Hara) who, unknown to him, has instead opted for a family reunion in a rented Northern California beach house. Not only has she included her teenage daughter Katie and younger son Danny but her married daughters and their families as well. The beach house turns out to be a monstrosity which Hobbs describes as ""Dragonwyck"". When their daughter Susan and her husband Stan show up with their bratty kids, things quickly get worse. The family is complete when daughter Jane and her husband Byron arrive with their infant daughter. By now, both Mr. and Mrs. Hobbs are somewhat disenchanted with this ""family reunion"" as Susan and her husband fight until he walks out on them, while Jane's husband takes up with the local bathing suit-clad vamp Manika. Daughter Katie meanwhile, grows more sullen by the day, sulking because of her new braces and brother Danny simply glues himself to the television set. Add an unhappy Finnish maid and you really have a recipe for disaster. But thanks to the delightful performance by Stewart, the laughs come thick and fast. His dry wit enlivens the film and almost single-handedly keeps it alive. And I mean alive because in spite of a capable cast including Fabian, John McGiver and Marie Wilson, the film belongs to Stewart. He does wonders with his hapless father role and keeps the audience in his corner every second. With the support of the eternally beautiful O'Hara (who's hardly anyones idea of a grandmother) and a memorable Henry Mancini score, ""Mr. Hobbs"" may depict a harrowing ""vacation"" but it's one the the viewer will thoroughly enjoy taking. The film has just been released on a beautiful widescreen DVD, with an original trailer and a few other extras. Bon Voyage! [phillindholm]",1126656000,14,2079,4.842696629213483
