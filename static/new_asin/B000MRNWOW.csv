8171585,5,B000MRNWOW,The film arrived fast and in perfect condition. It brought back wonderful memories for me and delighted my younger friends with its wealth of images of early adolescence in the 1960s.,1290902400,2,183,4.935483870967742
8171586,5,B000MRNWOW,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Seek/dp/B000MRNWOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and  Seek</a>&nbsp;Hide And Seek is that rare film that charms,touches your heart,and which paints joys and sorrows in which we see ourselves. Friedrich's effortless weaving of fiction and interviews is well known to her fans: like Godard(a different but still comparable film/video artist) she can make a tapestry of documentary,found footage,almost all the genres of cinema. Still, I think in celebrating her formal wonders people overlook how incredibly(not a overstatement) moving her work is:In some ways I'm reminded of Allison Anders film Gas Food Lodging. After perhaps 60 minutes I felt I knew the girls she shows growing up in the mid sixties. I saw my past in theirs(I'm of their generation) and was grateful for reliving a part of my adolescence. This is a lovely film showing the joys and stuggles we all go through (each in our own way). Hide and Seek shows what I love most about Friedrich's work:her way of showing our similarities and differences while all the while affirming what there is to love about us. One afterthought:look for the playground scene where some kids do a amazing Supremes performance. It's worth the price of admission!",1197504000,8,1288,5.605128205128205
