6597297,4,B00MOUF4G4,Loved getting our fix of Corner Gas! Wish they would do more movies or another series!,1421884800,,86,4.4375
6597298,5,B00MOUF4G4,"""Corner Gas The Move"" continues where the TV series finished and it's a great winner and a delight. The special feature as Brett and the director discuss each scene is a nice insight into the film's production. I hope Brett, et al are considering ""The Movie 2"". Thanks guys, it was fun!!!",1421020800,7,288,4.5576923076923075
6597299,5,B00MOUF4G4,"My husband has watched this several times and we haven't had it very long. If you liked the TV series, you'll like this just as much.",1420934400,4,133,4.153846153846154
6597300,5,B00MOUF4G4,"Although it stands on its own, both as a piece of art and as a movie, it would behoove ya to see the last tv show (Season 6) to help set the mood for viewing this masterpiece.  Did I say I loved it.",1419292800,7,198,3.604651162790698
6597301,5,B00MOUF4G4,"Always been a Corner Gas fan and this movie does NOT disappoint.

Starts off with a bang and the gags just keep coming.  It takes several watchings to get them all, especially the Oscar-isms.

Can't wait for the sequel (hint-hint-hint).",1418774400,16,236,4.85
6597302,5,B00MOUF4G4,"Corner Gas (2004-2009) was one of the most popular Canadian series ever produced and was also a big hit in the USA as well, so this is a welcome surprise to have a reunion movie just about 6 years after the series ended.  Corner Gas was and still is a Canadian cultural phenomenon, it received more than 80 award nominations, winning everything from an International Emmy Award to 7 Gemini awards. On November 19, 2005, Nancy Robertson who plays Wanda, married her Corner Gas co-star Brent Butt. They live in Vancouver.

Extra features on this DVD include commentary by Brent Butt and the other producers and there's behind the scenes featurettes - bloopers, extended scenes and a sing-along of the theme song - ""There's not a lot going on"".

During the series run (107 episodes), there were a number of special guest appearances by such famous Canadian celebrities such as Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Broadcaster and Politician Pamela Wallin, Broadcaster Lloyd Robertson, Finance Minister Paul Martin, Governor General Adrienne Clarkson, Pop Icon Michael Buble, Actor Kiefer Sutherland, Entertaiment Tonight Emcee Ben Mulroney, Rock Group The Tragically Hip, Scientist TV Host David Suzuki, Pop Singer Jann Arden, NHL Hockey Player Darryl Sittler and even Dog Hero The Littlest Hobo, so I was hoping this movie would have brought back a special surprise visit, but it doesn't happen this time.

The movie starts off with a hilarious opening skit, a sci-fi spoof - a werewolf fighting a robot, and like the theme song says, for the rest of the time, there's not a lot going on , but you'll have a real good time and it sure is great to see them all back again ! Not only that, but it made me go back and start watching the complete series again, there's nothing like it!",1418774400,26,1773,4.822368421052632
6597303,5,B00MOUF4G4,My wife and I drove 700 miles round trip to see this movie during it's limited run in Canadian theaters.  It was worth the effort.  We loved it!,1418601600,30,144,4.107142857142857

6597308,2,B00MOUF4G4,"This movie will be a disappointment for Corner Gas fans.  While it's nice to see the cast, there is little plot or humor.  It was obviously a chance for them to have a reunion and cash in on the popularity of the series.",1507939200,,220,4.093023255813954

6597314,2,B00MOUF4G4,"The series is one of my all-time favorites ~ I've watched seasons 1-6 multiple times.

I stumbled on the movie today ~ couldn't remember if I'd ever seen it or not. But, turns out I purchased it in 2015 and it is not in my collection so I obviously didn't think much of it or it would be with the series. The more I think about it, I do have vague memory of the movie attempting to be like the series but the plot being a bit mundane,",1503273600,,434,3.9318181818181817
6597315,4,B00MOUF4G4,"An A for effort. Sound seemed off, chemistry was rather variable; the trademark quick switcheswere fairly absent, or at least rare. A good wrap up, though, for fans.",1503014400,,165,4.928571428571429

6597318,3,B00MOUF4G4,"As much as I loved the 6 seasons of Corner Gas, this movie was really weird.  I've watched it a couple times and it's slightly better knowing in advance what happens next and the end, but was bummed that it was so weird compared to the great TV series.",1500422400,,252,4.142857142857143

6597322,4,B00MOUF4G4,Expected more.  Loved the series and this was sort of a stretch to make it work.  My grandfather was a druggist in Rouleau (Dog River) so of special interest to me.  Visited there last year.,1494115200,,190,4.371428571428571

6597327,5,B00MOUF4G4,"Yes the movie was a little different format from the show, but turning a half hour show into a full length movie means that it had to change a bit. I love that the original cast was all there. They still had great chemistry. Overall, it was a great follow up to the series.",1484179200,3,273,4.074074074074074

6597333,4,B00MOUF4G4,What can I say?  This was the last chance I'd ever get to see Corner Gas.  Did not disappoint but I'm glad I waited till the price went down from the original 45.00 it had been selling for when it first came out.,1482710400,,212,3.9069767441860463

6597337,5,B00MOUF4G4,"I was disappointed the first two or three times I watched this movie.  Afterwards, I am picking up on little bits and pieces that I missed the first few times viewing the movie.  I vacation in Banff, Alberta every summer.  Once on the way home, I noticed Dog River was painted on the side of the grain elevator in Roleau SK.  It wasn't until I got home and looked at the credits, that I realized that the series and movie were filmed in this small town.  Every evening, we will watch a couple of episodes of Corner Gas on DVD or the movie.  I can say that the movie has grown on me.",1479686400,,582,4.106194690265487

6597339,5,B00MOUF4G4,"If you're a fan of the Corner gas series, you won't be disappointed with this movie. I watched all 6 seasons of the show and this movie was on par with the show plus more special effects and craziness like werewolves vs.robots, exploding cop cars, etc. It may sound ridiculous but it works well into the story. Gag Reel is included along with commentary and interviews. I am an American who likes Canadian humor. Or is it humour?",1473724800,,429,4.512820512820513
6597340,5,B00MOUF4G4,"We discovered the show Corner Gas a few years ago, and were really sad when we came to the end of the series. We were excited when we read that the cast was making a movie, but couldn't find it anywhere in U.S. movie theaters or even on streaming services. If you're a fan of the show, you'll like the movie. It's quite good. Will there be a sequel??",1473292800,,350,4.086956521739131
6597341,5,B00MOUF4G4,Loved the tv show and thought the movie was also great. Very funny without a lot of foul language or nudity. I would let my grandkids watch this. Wish the tv show was still on.,1473292800,,176,4.057142857142857
6597342,5,B00MOUF4G4,Love Corner Gas!  Wish there were more.  We live in US & bought all 6 seasons.,1472774400,,78,3.8125
6597343,5,B00MOUF4G4,"LMAO! From a Texan that's loved Canadian humor since Red Green in the '90's, Corner Gas the Movie made me laugh just as hard throughout. What a way to go out with a bang. Thankfully not in a literal sense  At least Canadian shows are something different and refreshing to the monotony of American comedy shows.",1472256000,,310,4.535714285714286
6597344,3,B00MOUF4G4,"Not up to the standard of the tv show
Has a whole different feel and not as connected between cast and not very funny.",1471996800,,118,3.9583333333333335
6597345,5,B00MOUF4G4,"I love Corner Gas, I have the entire series and the movie was a bonus.
It's like a Canadian Seinfeld, just a show about nothing.",1471392000,,128,4.16

6597347,5,B00MOUF4G4,"Its like a homecoming!  After having watched all 6 seasons...a few times, it was great to see a feature-length movie that was able to capture the fun and charm of my favorite little Canadian town!!  This is a must-watch!!",1470787200,,221,4.641025641025641
6597348,5,B00MOUF4G4,Great movie. Get the box set of the whole series to go with it. Always puts a smile on my face.,1470182400,,95,3.5714285714285716
6597349,5,B00MOUF4G4,Best show ever!,1469923200,,15,4.333333333333333
6597350,2,B00MOUF4G4,"Loved the show, but the movie suffers from the same thing that any one-off reunion suffers; the characters are played just slightly differently to where they don't feel like the same characters the audience loved from the show. There are some nice nods to lines and situations from the show, though.

Trying not to spoil here, but one major gripe for me is how they handled ""Brent and Lacey""; the way they did it during the show's run was perfect, as it was consistent with the characters, but here it's just too ""fan-servicey"".",1469404800,,528,4.67741935483871

6597356,3,B00MOUF4G4,"I guess I was expecting more from the reviews that I saw. I would say this movie is closer to three stars than four stars, but it was enjoyable for a Corner Gas fan. My husband and I loved this show when it was on, and the movie is a nice reminder of a great show, but it just kind of made me sad that there are no more episodes.",1464566400,,329,3.7142857142857144

You can really tell that some of the actors have aged which is a bit jarring when you watch it right after binge watching the original TV shows. But I loved it nonetheless. This is a definite 'buy' for all fans of Corner Gas!,1457222400,2,282,4.1454545454545455
6597368,5,B00MOUF4G4,"For those of you who are familiar with Corner Gas the series, you know just how great this show was.  It is a show made in Canada by Canadians that is full of intelligent humor, silliness, and running jokes that keep you laughing episode after episode, season after season.
Every character from the main ones to the background characters are perfectly cast and you really learn to love all of them.  Each one is tremendously funny and play well off of one another.
This movie is the final punctuation on the end of a brilliant and much loved show.  I am sad that it is gone as shows with this kind of magic don't come along often especially for those of us who prefer family friendly comedy.  I highly recommend it.",1457136000,10,715,4.435114503816794

Still I decided to take the plunge and I must say it was great! The opening scenario fell right in line with the previous seasons and I really enjoyed it. I was happy to see both Gwen Seed (Myrtle) and Jean Freeman (Fitzy's grandma) amongst the citizens of Dog River.

If you have never heard of Corner Gas, well, it's the greatest Canadian TV show of all time...OF ALL TIME! You should buy the 6-season series on DVD immediately if not sooner and then get this movie as well. Not a great film, but it completes the collection and is a nice way to say goodbye to a favorite show.",1453680000,5,441,4.2

6597385,5,B00MOUF4G4,"I loved the Canadian TV series so, when I learned the movie had been made and was available, I added it to my collection.

This episode was a tad more zany than the series episodes, but that just made for louder cries of laughter by my wife and me.

Actually, the movie length permitted for more dialogue and actual acting by Oscar Leroy (Eric Peterson) and by Davis Quinton (Lorne Cardinal). In fact, Cardinal does a terrific tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a ca 1940s private detective.

Since I loathe spoilers I shall say no more. I do hope to see additional movies in the future - this is probably the best comedy cast in television.

Oh, and I soon will be viewing another tv series created by Brent Butt - Hiccups. Sadly, though, only one member of the Corner Gas crew joined Butt in Hiccups. Nancy Robertson. Still, with the quality of Butt's writing, I'm sure I will love Hiccups.",1452384000,3,886,4.553459119496855

6597429,3,B00MOUF4G4,"This movie opens with complete societal breakdown (including a cop-car explosion) in the town of Dog River.  There is a reason, though, which the remainder of the movie explains.  Economic hardship has befallen Dog River thanks to some poor investment decisions by Mayor Fitzy, and our heroes must come up with new ways to bring the town back from the brink of complete collapse.  (Brent takes over the hotel bar, and Wanda opens a casino in Davis's basement, etc...)  As usual, things don't always go as planned, keeping things entertaining.

The best scene from the movie was, of course, Hank's extremely vivid imagination of a fight between a werewolf and a robot.

Unfortunately, the reminder of a poor economy hits just a bit too close to home, and the movie does not have the ""bite"" the series had, probably related to the time considerations.  Still, it's enjoyable to relax and spend some time with the characters we've come to love, even if some of them do seem a little worse for the wear.

It has everything you would expect from corner gas in terms of the story, the humor, and the characters. Dog River is the same familiar and friendly place that fans of the show remember. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this movie. The jokes were great and I laughed throughout and had a smile on my face until the end. The only thing it left me wanting was another movie.

For those of you who have not seen corner gas I highly recommend you seek it out and watch it. It is the best family-friendly entertainment you're going to find. Like Johnny Carson always managed to do the humor is adult but yet acceptable for people of all ages.

6597446,3,B00MOUF4G4,"I am an absolute fan of this series. I watched it as it aired and was bummed when the finale came. I even watched Brent's followup show Hiccups. The show was really cute, fun, and light. It didn't need to be nasty to make a good joke. It is Canada's highest rated show for a reason. When a movie was announced, I was floored. I couldn't believe I would get a chance to visit Dog River again. I was so excited when the campaign started, but when I watched the movie, I was a little disappointed.

First off the good stuff:
1. The entire main cast returned. Everyone is a little older, but still able to reprise their roles. Even Oscar and Emma were present despite their advanced years.
2. There were a decent amount of solid laughs in the films. Nothing quite as good as the show, but still in the same spirit.
3. A lot of the old locations show up: The Ruby, Corner Gas (duh), and even a closer look at Wullerton (spit)
4. The movie was well shot and looked very nice. The transition to film from tv is pretty seamless.

The Bad:

1. Despite the movie looking nice according to film standards, I don't think Corner Gas really works in a movie format. A lot of the quick cuts, multicam angles, and musical transitions that stylized the show are sadly missing from the movie. When a single pan goes through a crowd as they talk, it just doesn't feel like the show. Plus, a show that wraps up in 22 minutes doesn't really lend itself to a 90 minute feature length movie.
2. The story arch seems really weak for this movie. The town is in trouble and everyone needs to band together to save it. It sort of reminds me of the finale of season 4. Everyone is talking about moving, no one knows what to do, etc. I feel like they could have done something a little better.
3. The tone of the movie is all wrong. Lacey rants throughout the film, Brent looks miserable, and everyone else is just along for the ride. The movie is way too dramatic for the series. They should have done something much lighter for the return. Brent basically ruins himself financially through the course of the film (LOL). It just feels like the focus moved from the laughs.
4. I know everyone is a little older, but couldn't Brent, Hank, and Davis prepared for the movie a little? They all look pudgy and rough. Brent was always a big guy, but he is much bigger in this movie. Doesn't seem healthy.
5. For some reason (maybe the pregnancy) Karen's voice seems 2 octaves lower than usual. She doesn't sound like her usual self. Maybe the actress was putting on a voice throughout the series and couldn't quite get back to it for the movie. It just seems odd.

Despite its flaws, I still enjoyed the movie and would still recommend it to fans of the series.",1430956800,,2726,4.3392156862745095

6597461,5,B00MOUF4G4,"when a series' premise and ensemble add up to the sort of ""magic"" that outlasts the series itself, it's hard not to be tempted to reunite years later...and just as hard to justify the effort should you succumb to the temptation. it can be done - see Rescue From Gilligan's Island and/or Get Smart Again! - but well, for every one of those, there's at least a dozen misfires like Return Of The Beverly Hillbillies or The Addams Family Halloween Special. in other words, like pretty much everything else in show-business, it's a crapshoot.
it's gratifying and them some to be able to report that the return of Brent Leroy & Company has more in common with Maxwell Smart's triumphant return than with Jed Clampett's pointless rehash. you could perhaps argue that the relative brevity of the gap had something to do with that: where the aforementioned reunions were decades later, this film was designed to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the series' premiere. well, there is indeed room for that possibility, so go ahead and think so if you'd like to.
but don't forget, there were other minefields to navigate their way around as well. by the very nature of movies they had to readjust the formula. the series consisted of 22 1/2-minute episodes which tended to feature three plots per episode, whereas here they had to sustain a single story for 95 minutes. even the fact that it was predominately the same crew - producer Virginia Thompson, producer/director David Storey - couldn't guarantee that it would work out. but then, it didn't hurt, either.
the story finds Dog River, that realm that appears to be in the prairies, feeling as much more like The Twilight Zone as ever. well-meaning but ditzy mayor ""Fitzy"" (Cavan Cunningham) has made a number of less than astute investments which left the town on the verge of bankruptcy. even the local power and water are only sporadically working. the obvious class of panic ensues, and the situation isn't helped much by the fact that our central core of characters have their personal issues to deal with as well.
take the police force. when Davis (Lorne Cardinal) is forced to retire he decides to be a private detective a' la Sam Spade, and sets up shop in the police station basement. so Karen (Tara Spencer-Nairn) finds herself keeping the peace single-handedly...which would be tricky enough if she weren't pregnant. it's mentioned in passing that she has a husband stationed ""somewhere on the Mediterranean coast."" in a textbook example of the series' surrealist spirit, they simply acknowledge with a shrug that Spencer-Nairn happened to be pregnant during production rather than contriving some backstory that would only of bogged down the pace.
the old folks' find excuses in the situation to be as prickly as ever. father Oscar (Eric Peterson) sets out to become a wilderness survivalist and trades the car in for a horse. mother Emma (Janet Wright) tries to recognize the severity of the crisis but can't help being more preoccupied with the fact that Brent (Brent Butt) is still single and, slightly more to the point, she still has no grandchildren.
Hank (Fred Ewanuick) is, alas, still the same few I.Q. points shy of qualifying for the post of Village Idiot. this time he tries to get a doughnut shop chain to open a local branch, which obviously strains his relationship with Ruby caf proprietor Lacey (Gabrielle Miller). any ""dope"" character could do this much of course, but it takes a Hank go one better (or worse): he makes a garbled and disjointed attempt to enlist Brent's support in some plan he has, which he assumes Brent will bankroll, and gets pissed off when he doesn't.
Wanda (Nancy Robertson), the local intellectual - whom, you'll recall, got more and more morally felxible as the series progressed - finds the obligatory angle to exploit. asked to housesit while Davis goes on vacation, she coverts his ""man cave"" garage into a bar and/or casino.
Lacey is the one with the most free brain cells to devote to the crisis. her plan is to spruce what's left of the town up just enough to win a ""quaintest town in Canada"" contest, but she actually alienates people by throwing too much of her passion into the cause. criticized for being ""bossy,"" she replies ""because i'm the boss."" at the point where things are their darkest she is ousted in favor of Emma. usually Emma is the ideal choice for such a committee, but as already mentioned, at this point she's too preoccupied with Brent's biological clock to give it her all.
which leaves Brent, who turns out to be the character who develops here. (that's the advantage of writing the movie you're starring in.) the usually indolent gas-station owner tends to pride himself on his ability to ""sit things out."" but his ""happy place"" is in more trouble that he can hide from himself this time, and he makes an effort by buying and trying to run the abandoned local bar. he seems to be limping along pretty well, but then comes a confrontation with the aforementioned doughnut chain's representative, who is injured in his attempt to leave the premises. reformed know-it-all Wanda offers her services as attorney, but even she can't get around the fact that Brent is, technically, guilty.
so we have a few substantial messes to clear up here, and needless to say our heroes manage to sort things out. what's especially unique is that they manage to present as maudlin an ultimate resolution without being maudlin in the least. as per the unique spirit of the unique series, they keep from being sappy by going for the sap whole-hog. like the classic series in which Adam West plays Batman, they spoof established conventions by playing them absolutely to the hilt.
all of which builds up to a truly astonishing twist. actually two, if you count the fact it took until that final scene for Oscar's catchphrase, ""jackass!,"" to make it into the film. (who knew they could even DO that?)
and let us not forget that because this is a film we get a few surprises for the upped ante. for instance, the film begins by finally showing the suggested showdown between a werewolf and a robot.
the most significant, though, is that we finally get to see Wullerton. one of the outstanding running-gags of the series is that the denizens of Dog River have, for no readily apparent reason, such disdain for the neighboring town of Wullerton that everyone spits on the ground whenever it's mentioned. and we finally get to see why it's so horrible: where Dog River is a community of dysfuctional, flaws humans, Wullerton is as pure, wholesome, goody-two-shoes a place as you could possibly imagine. they even held fundraisers to help Dog River out of it's crisis, ""the self-serving bastards.""
they say to always go out on top and leave an audience wanting more. as of November of 2014, Corner Gas has done so not once, but twice!",1427068800,5,6838,4.795762711864406

6597481,4,B00MOUF4G4,"Corner Gas is a very unique show and I was skeptical about them making a movie for it.  It is a true show about nothing, more so than Seinfeld, which it has similarities to.  I thought they might try too hard and that the characters might be off from the show since it has been a few years.  I also thought it might just be an hour and a half long episode of the show.  But it turns out that it is more movie-like than the show.  I think they did pretty well capturing the essence of the show, just in a movie format.  The characters felt pretty natural, almost like there wasn't a break in between.  There was quite a bit of laughs and I thought it was very enjoyable.  It probably helped that it's been a while since there's been new Gas and this was a new fill up.  It is not as subtle as the show, but that's to be expected.  Still well written and clever in a Corner Gas kind of way though.  I would recommend the show over the movie.

A good companion to the series.",1422489600,,972,4.031413612565445

I was so excited when I accidentally discovered this movie existed but was almost afraid to watch after having been disappointed by a Different series that came back only to give us a terrible ending. However, Corner Gas did Not disappoint! We thoroughly enjoyed it!  The only disappointment was wishing there would be many more delightful episodes to look forward to.  We actually watched it again a couple of nights later!  Love Corner Gas!  Wish they would do more!",1518739200,,573,4.747474747474747
