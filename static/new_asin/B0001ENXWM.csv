8011327,2,B0001ENXWM,"I am a begginer guitar player and was hoping Ted would show how to play his songs from the basics. It's definitley for more advanced players but, he does show some neat techniques.",1415577600,,180,4.484848484848484
8011328,5,B0001ENXWM,"i was given this when i was about 12 yrs old on VHS , it helped me in my adventure of learning guitar. now that im 31 i bought it on DVD, so i can still go back and watch uncle ted jam out and still learn something new, highly suggest to get this dvd, to any ted nugent fan, or aspiring guitar players.",1364515200,,302,3.734375
8011329,5,B0001ENXWM,"As someone else quoted, it's not your conventional instructional DVD on guitar playing. However in this DVD - you'll find things that you don't find in other instructional DVDs - thats right Ted Nugent!
Now I must admit - I've always wondered how Ted did half the crazy stuff on guitar. Now I have more of an understanding, but no one plays the guitar like Uncle Ted.
Throughout this DVD I was pmsl at Teds comments. And yes he does go into his hunting and other activites. However it is a coaching DVD for anyone interested in a unique way of playing the guitar and some cool techniques.
Personally I got a lot out of the DVD - from playing and taming hollow bodies guitars, to super muting licks, use of non standard scales and patterns to guitar choices. Last but not least - attitude! You gotta have attitude ;) And we all know about Teds!
Ted does show you how to play his most popular songs quickly, but also explains the technique used to achive it as well and the background of where it came from.
For the price of this DVD - personally I think it's a must have. Certainly opened my eyes to new techniques and I've been playing for 20 years! Well - what are you waiting for???",1298073600,3,1184,4.337837837837838
8011330,3,B0001ENXWM,"A lot of great information on it, but also, a lot of Ted bragging about how great he is. He is a great guitarist, but he doesn't have to tell me over and over - I already know! Would of rather have had him demonstrate his licks and riffs at slower speeds. Would have been a more effective use of time on this DVD. Worth taking a look at.",1168387200,,337,3.898550724637681
8011331,4,B0001ENXWM,"This instructional video was filmed in the 1990s, and doesn't follow the typical guitar lesson format.  It isn't so much instruction as it is coaching.  Ted gives a good bit of his philosophy and spirit here, but if you are looking for scales and chops you may want to move on to one of the many videos featuring a music school grad.  If however you want insight into how a successful entertainer keeps his enthusiasm and energy long after many of his peers have crapped out and/or overdosed, then this is a must have.

Ted Nugent is more than qualified to talk about what works and what doesn't.  To be fair, he does show how he plays many of his signature riffs.  The downside to the video is Ted making way too many references to his other interests (hunting and conservation) for a typical garage rocker.

Are you a Ted Nugent fan?  Do you play guitar?  If yes and yes, pick up the video.",1112140800,6,892,4.390243902439025
