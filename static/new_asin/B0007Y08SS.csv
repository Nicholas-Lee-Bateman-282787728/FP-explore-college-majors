2249551,5,B0007Y08SS,"yes the first season didn't have any extras and im sure this one won't either, but come on people this is MACGYVER finally out on dvd. my personal favorite show of all time this is and will be without a doubt a must have, even if youve never watched the show before-buy it, you will not be dissapointed and will be instantly hooked (not to mention impatiently waiting for the next season, and the one after and so on). I for one am extremely excited about the best tv series in the history of tv finally out on dvd. keep em coming.",1114560000,7,531,4.215686274509804
2249552,5,B0007Y08SS,"A unique and different kind of TV action series, MacGyver made its television premiere in the Fall of 1985 to much fanfare. Audiences immediately responded to the title character and his unusual penchant for turning everyday items like chewing gum and paperclips into elaborate life-saving contraptions. In this way, it maintained a slight resemblance to The A-Team, and this recurring plot device helped MacGyver build a strong cult following...

Richard Dean Anderson plays the title role of MacGyver, an energetic employee of the fictional Phoenix Foundation for Research. An unorthodox hero by action series standards, MacGyver has a deadly fear of heights. A pacifist who refuses to use weapons, he relies heavily on his ability to use his brain and tinker with the various materials at his disposal. MacGyver's best friend, and the director of the Phoenix Foundation, is Pete Thornton (Dana Elcar). Pete often sends MacGyver on Foundation missions and sometimes comes to his aid (usually after MacGyver has saved the day). In addition, MacGyver is joined on a regular basis by his airplane pilot friend Jack Dalton (Bruce McGill), a man who constantly entangles himself in illegal activities and other troublesome situations. Between the usual slew of bad guys, the vendetta of archenemy Murdoc (Michael Des Barres), and his multitude of troublesome friends, MacGyver is always in the midst of interesting and dangerous events, and the show's true entertainment value derives from watching MacGyver's distinctive method of dealing with each one...

The MacGyver (Season 2) DVD features a number of action-packed episodes including the season premiere ""The Human Factor"" in which MacGyver and the Phoenix Foundation are called upon to test the security of a top-secret military installation. When MacGyver makes a bet with the security designer, Dr. Jill Ludlum, he successfully gains entry, but the automated system traps them both inside (with a dwindling supply of oxygen) where they're forced to race for their lives against a ticking clock... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""The Road Not Taken"" in which MacGyver encounters his former fiance while helping a nun, and ""Birth Day"" in which MacGyver must guard a pregnant woman from her husband, who's out to kill her...

Below is a list of episodes included on the MacGyver (Season 2) DVD:

2249769,5,B0007Y08SS,"What can I say ?  I love this entire series and Richard Dean Anderson as Mac was definitely an original creation. In my opinion, this character can never be copied better from anyone else so I would not even attempt to try a remake today with a different star--again,  that's my opinion.  7 great seasons. I own the entire series set, but I purchased this one because one of my 2nd season discs had a flaw that interfered with it's playback. This set was priced very reasonable so I just purchased the whole 2nd season to replace the bad disc I turned up. The only thing that is a disappointment: Please understand these shows were not filmed in HD, so don't expect HD playback perfectionist quality. But the quality is better on these discs as opposed to broadcast quality. They were filmed in stereo so they sound great. Like all series there are great outstanding episodes, great ones, good ones and fair ones, and some series have poor to bad- this series has few fair ones and none are ever dull. This is a series that is timeless and meant to play over and over again for adults and kids safe.",1399507200,2,1099,4.45771144278607

He does not use a gun.,1397433600,,321,3.8923076923076922

There are too many role models out there today for kids that teach them the end of a gun is a way to solve their problems. Mac uses his brain! What a concept, we need more MacGyvers in this world!

2249860,3,B0007Y08SS,"Loyalty is what really keeps people coming back to MacGyver.  It has been fifteen years since MacGyver ended his 7 season run and I still love the show.  I recognize that it is campy (just ask MSN), the plot is often thin and the way that items show up just perfect for MacGyver's use is...well, predictable.  However, even though this is a formula show, I would guess that, just as with me, many people love and watch this show because of the memories surrounding watching the original broadcasts.  I wasn't able to get into the first few seasons when it originally aired as I was only 3 years old.  But I do remember that on Monday nights I got to stay up late so that I could watch MacGyver with my Dad, who would remark at every commercial break, ""MacGyver's a dead man.""  Simple memories like this make me want to continue to watch this show.  It is this same loyalty and memory that allows me to give this show three stars.  I have no intention of telling anyone that this show is masterful in its acting, directing or plot, it is often silly.  I know that the show is sometimes stupid, but as someone that can't turn on the TV anymore because the current programming saddens me, I long for the campy shows of just a few years ago.  The entertainment value of the show builds this show up.  My own roommate will only watch the show when I'm watching it.  Mostly so he can make fun of it, but it also is entertaining him.  MacGyver will remain on my shelves.  Hopefully, there will come a day when I'll be able to watch it with people that won't ""Waa Waa"" (trumpet sound) the silly acting, the strange villains and impossible scenarios and will just enjoy it as it was meant to be enjoyed, as an entertaining show of the mid-late 80s and early 90s.",1171756800,6,1753,4.3538461538461535

2249863,5,B0007Y08SS,"Macgyver is my favorite show, and I would definitely recomend buying it. The first and second seasons are funny, interesting, and action-packed. The show Macgyver is about Angus Macgyver who works at the Pheonix foundation for research. Evil robbers, assasins and thugs confornt Macgyver. Macgyver uses every day items to invent things. If you want a show that's similar to James Bond, but way better, get Macgyver season two.",1137542400,2,426,5.188405797101449

2249866,5,B0007Y08SS,"Excellent! I bought this along with season one, and it's just as good. Some of the episodes are even better than that of the first season. Look out for the awesome episode ""Partners"" where we get introduced to the assassin 'Murdock', who also shows up in one episode of all the other seasons. It's also the episode that tells of how Mac and Pete first met up, and how Mac got the job at the Phoenix Foundation.

Overall this is a great season, and highly recommended. 10/10",1127260800,2,473,4.436781609195402

I am thrilled to finally have ALL the episodes I have missed in one great spot. The quality of the episodes is not always the greatest but considering the fact we got them at all I am not complaining.

I heard a lot of the DVD's are not running right but returning them is the best thing. Mine have been ok so far.

There is and never will be another MacGyver.

Richard we love you!!

2249901,5,B0007Y08SS,"The MacGyver television series can be divided roughly into two separate phases, each plagued by different problems.  The first phase would be the first few seasons, blessed with great writing and acting but unfortunately overtly dated with campy special effects and the overuse of stock footage.  The second phase, particularly the last couple years of the show, saw the special effects improve but unfortunately the writing suffered.  The storylines became corny and MacGyver became more of an urban-savior, dealing more with ghettos and gangs rather than rugged CIA-type secret agent work.  Still, the second season marks a time when the show was finding its stride, and the second, third, and fourth seasons really were the best of the entire series.  The episode plots in season two are similar in style to those of the first season -- MacGyver travels all over the world to foil plots involving drugs, kidnapping, environmental destruction -- all while using his brains and science rather than brute strength or guns.  But the characters are better developed in the second season, particularly that of Pete Thorton (MacGyver's boss), who becomes a prime player and good friend of MacGyver's.  Like in all seasons, MacGyver rescues countless women, all of whom he seems to have dated at some point in his past.  But it's good wholesome fun from an era when television action shows weren't all about computerized special effects.",1120521600,18,1432,5.142241379310345

2249903,4,B0007Y08SS,"Although I do not consider myself a die-hard viewer of MacGyver, I would nevertheless like to point out with regret that Dana Elcar (ne Ibson Dana Elcar), who portrayed Pete Thornton and whose real-life battle with glaucoma was incorporated into the script, passed away around June 6 or 7, 2005.

In spite of his struggle with the glaucoma that eventually cost him his eyesight, he continued to work using a special computerized text-writing device.  He was a great character actor, appearing in countless movies and television episodes and more recently, in roles tailored for him. One such role was in an episode of ER as a sightless diabetic.

He will be greatly missed.",1118448000,14,673,4.938053097345133
2249904,4,B0007Y08SS,"Here we are again for a second season of Macgyver.

This season finds MacGyver dealing with the Phoenix foundation for the first time. He will soon face his deadliest of enemies in Murdoc. MacGyver is back in great form immediately from the get go. In ""The Human Factor"" he matches wits against an artificial intelligence out for blood. MacGyver at his best.

I won't waste your time listing episode by episode, but realize that MacGyver's second trip to DVD is more of the same great MacGyver that we came to love, but once again is presented on a meager DVD setting. Perhaps eventually (season 7?) we'll see some behind the scenes, or special features, but for now we must let the quality of the show speak for its own.",1118102400,5,721,4.5813953488372094

And everyone in the USA will be able to purchase this brilliant DVD to sit at home and look at Richard Dean Anderson again and again and again.

It is really sad that this DVD is not available in Germany (Especially in the European Format). So, pleeease! Hurry up and bring it to Europe as well! I will buy it straight away!",1116892800,2,480,4.1063829787234045

As one of the best shows ever on television, you would think it would be an easy choice. However, it is here, and I am overjoyed. It has something for everyone. For the girls, it has a hot star and the hero every girl wants to be there when they have a crisis. For the guys, it has action, adventure, bombs, and even some nail biting moments. During the second season, we see a little bit more about our reluctant, but always present hero. Give him a stick of gum and a wire, he'll make a bomb. To all those who are complaing about no extras...get over it! It was hard enough just getting the dvd. I am looking forward to this season because, my personal favorite character (besides Mac) Murdoch will be out in full force. Everyone will enjoy this dvd.",1115424000,9,845,4.320754716981132
