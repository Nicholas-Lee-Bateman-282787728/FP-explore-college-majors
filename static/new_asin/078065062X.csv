34697,5,078065062X,"Right off the bat I have to admit that there was a moment in 'I Walked With A Zombie' where I found myself on the edge of my seat and biting a ragged chunk from my index fingernail.  I would be the first skeptic to say ""Yeah, whatever"" if someone said that a movie this old could still pack a punch, but 'I Walked With A Zombie' does just that.  The story is simple ... city nurse goes to an island where voodoo is the national pastime and finds herself mixing it up with zombies.  But when we think of zombies today, we tend to imagine the faster, bloodier, fang-filled versions of more recent movies like 'Shaun of the Dead' and '28 Weeks Later'.  Producer Val Lewton's zombies are more classical ... shuffling, bug-eyed undead who relentlessly pursue their victims, even if it takes them days to actually reach them. -- This movie combines excellent production values and intelligent scripting to produce a movie that is as hypnotic and interesting today as it was then. -- And luckily, this set is doubled with 'The Body Snatcher' (arguably, Boris Karloff's greatest role).  This movie deals with a doctor and the blackmailing grave robber who provides cadavers for his midnight researches.  Karloff comes out of the gate running in this one -- partially chewing the scenery and genuinely giving off creepy vibes.  He is all menace in this movie.  In a small but excellent turn is Bela Lugosi (like the Kirk/Picard debates, there is argument over who was the king of the horror genre, Lugosi or Karloff.  It's Karloff by many many miles, but Lugosi was great, so long as he didn't actually have to carry a picture).  Lugosi plays something with stringy hair and an indecipherable accent and he does this very well, even getting some screen time with Karloff, making 'Body Snatcher' a delight for anyone who used to stay up late on Saturday nights, watching whatever black and white offering the local TV stations used to provide.  These two films are often used as examples of producer Val Lewton's finest work.  Who can argue?  These movies still make me jump.",1186185600,6,2065,4.686980609418282
34698,5,078065062X,"To get an in depth read on the movies themselves and alot of information check out the Amazon review on The Val Lewton Horror Collection (recommended) they do a great job, tons of info.
I originally bought Cat People (which includes Curse of The Cat People) when it was added to Roger Ebert's great movie list, I've loved nearly everything from that list and I like horror so i picked it up.  I didn't buy the whole Val Lewton Collection not knowing enough about the movies at the time and thinking it was perhaps a case of putting the best movie in a box set, which is not the case at all.  After watching Cat People and loving it i checked out more titles from director Jacques Tourneur purchasing the Night of the Demon/Curse of the Demon dvd and loving that one even more, and i also picked up the great film noir by Tourneur Out of The Past (also on Ebert's great list), now after reading more on Tourneur and reviews on his work even picking up a couple books i came upon I Walked With a Zombie which was also highly recommended and that's in the Val Lewton Horror Collection as well.  You'd think I learned my lesson but i figured it was Tourneur who was the star of this package and i hadn't heard to much on The Leopard Man so i figured seeing i had Cat People I'd save some cash and just pick up I walked With a Zombie/The body Snatcher.  So I watch I walked With a Zombie and loved it, then popped in the second feature The body Snatcher starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi hearing nothing on and expecting nothing i ended up thoroughly  enjoying it as well.  The Body Snatcher which was directed by Robert Wise (west side story, the sound of music) winner of 4 oscars and also did another great horror film which i enjoy The Haunting and Curse of the Cat People which is also in the Val Lewton Horror Collection.
The other four were directed by Mark Robson two time oscar nominee.  Producers were big in movies back then as directors are now and I've only heard great things of Val Lewton.
So, if you like anything by directors Jacques Tourneur (Cat people, Night of the demon, Out of the past, I walked with a zombie), Robert Wise (the hauting), Mark Robson, or like anything produced by Val Lewton or like classic horror in general definitely splurge for the Val Lewton Horror Collection.  I'm confident that if you like one of the movies, the directors, or the producer you'll love the majority of the set and with 9 films for 48$ that's just 5$ a dvd, a great buy.",1185148800,,2483,4.359307359307359
34699,5,078065062X,"These titles are two of Lewton's best, with ""Zombie"" a stand-out, due to its sublimely creepy atmosphere, a literate script (reputedly based on ""Jane Eyre""!), and charismatic turns by both Dee and Conway. Exploration of voodoo practices adds spice as well. ""The Body Snatcher"" is also a grabber, with excellent character actor Daniell in top form, and Karloff riveting as the sneering, cold-blooded Gray, a role that displays the star's impressive acting chops without all the Frankenstein make-up. ""Snatcher"" also includes a secondary role for Bela Lugosi as MacFarlaine's servant Joseph. Sadly, Bela's career was on the wane at this point, and this would mark Karloff and Lugosi's last screen outing together.",1182729600,,711,5.357142857142857
34700,5,078065062X,"Excellent, somewhat campy, often genuinely creepy film from the fine French director Jacques Tourneur, I Walked with a Zombie is less well-known than his famous Cat People but perhaps even more accomplished. Something of a  Jane Eyre story recast in the West Indies, the film features an added treat in watching the calypso great Sir Lancelot act as a kind of Greek chorus, narrating the action.",1170288000,4,395,4.984848484848484
34701,5,078065062X,"I rented this for I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE because  I was intrigued that it is supposedly ""inspired"" by Jane Eyre, perhaps my favorite book.  Well, like Jane Eyre it has a young woman in love with a man she works for who has a ""mad"" wife and both mad women had spent some time on tropical islands but the similarities pretty much end there.  The story told in ZOMBIE is compelling and though not pure horror is quite spooky at times.  The nurse taking the mad woman through the sugar canes to get to the voodoo ceremony was suspenseful and chilling and there are some other creepy touches throughout the movie.  The atmosphere of the island is deftly created by a soundtrack of songs and mysterious drumbeats as well as decent acting and believable sets.  The romance between the nurse and the ""zombie's"" husband was of secondary importance to the voodoo tale.

  I wasn't even going to watch THE BODYSNATCHER but when I saw it had both Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in it I thought it deserved a look.  The movie was well plotted and paced and the secondary story of the crippled little girl fit in well with the main plot line.  I don't know enough about 19th century Scotland to say the setting of the story is historically accurate but the movie sure gave the feeling and mood of that time and place.  And like ""Zombie"" this is a well told story that makes sense in it's context.  Karloff's acting as ""the bodysnatcher"" is great and Lugosi has a fairly minor part as a doctor's servant who tries to blackmail Karloff and is killed in a rather chilling scene.  The ending is a little over the top but I have to admit I liked it. Both movies are just a little over an hour a piece so they make a great double feature.",1153267200,3,1717,4.375394321766562
34702,3,078065062X,"This DVD double feature presents two mismatched 1940s horror films: one is quite good, the other a rediculously bad movie worthy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Others here have already summarized the plots and wieghed in their opinions, so foregoing the plots, I'll add my own thoughts about the movies.

THE BODY SNATCHER - is definitely the better of the two. It has no gross-looking corpses or other cheap thrills, instead, the story ""gets under your skin"" with mounting tension and suspense. The acting is superb, and Boris Karloff is particularly creepy as the body snatcher, John Gray. The back-and-forth storytelling between a young girl who requires surgery to reverse the effects of spreading paralysis caused by a tumor, and the doctor who turns to dead bodies to learn his craft is very effective. The story has it all: night-time graveyards, murders, and perhaps even a ghost or two. There's plenty of action and the film's 78 minutes seem to fly by. I was completely absorbed in the very believeable world of 1831 Edinburgh created by the filmmakers.

I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE - on the other hand, was a complete waste of time. The acting, while decent, seemed a bit stiff and forced at times. I never got the same feeling of suspense as I did with ""Body Snatcher."" The movie dragged, and I felt like the plot wasn't going anywhere. On the few occasions where the movie managed to quicken my heartbeat just a bit in anticipation of something about to happen, it turned out to be a false alarm and I was left somewhat disappointed. I never got the same feeling of ""atmosphere"" as other reviews here have pointed out (and I watched it with the lights out on a ""dark and stormy night""). In the second half, the story had really fallen to pieces and when the end came, I was stunned for a few moments--it was wrapped up so quickly and sloppily that I almost couldn't believe it. Many loose ends were left dangling, questions unanswered, and the plot still hadn't really advanced. Among the many questions that shot through my mind at the end of the film, the one that most burned in my mind was ""So what?"" I suppose there's no arguing in matters of taste, particularly when it comes to ""art,"" so I won't raise a fuss with the other reviewers here who claim this picture as a brilliant an inspired work of filmmaking, but I will say that I found it to be a tremendous let-down. I'd recommend renting the movie first. If, after the first fifteen minutes, you find yourself taken with the movie's ""atmosphere"" and ""mood,"" you'll probably like the rest. If, however, like me you wonder ""where is this going?"" or think to yourself ""this is boring,"" you might as well stop there because it doesn't get any better.

The DVD *is* worth a rental--if only for ""The Body Snatchers,"" but ultimately, it's a mixed bag.",1144972800,7,2814,4.646586345381526
34703,5,078065062X,"Val Lewton (1904-1951) was brought to RKO when that studio decided to compete with Universal in the horror genre. As it happened, RKO was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy at the time--and Lewton was given the audience-tested title CAT PEOPLE and ordered to create an inexpensive movie to fit it. Without the budget to create ""a monster movie,"" Lewton responded with a series of remarkably artful films that relied on suggestion and implication.

Released in 1943, I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is considered by many to be Lewton's single best film.  Directed by Jacques Tourneur (who also directed Lewton's CAT PEOPLE and LEOPARD MAN), the story concerns nurse Betsy Connell (Frances Dee), who is hired to care for mysterious Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon--and who finds herself romantically torn between the woman's husband Paul (Tom Conway) and his half-brother Holland (James Ellison.)  But no sooner does Nurse Connell settle in to the situation than she becomes unsettled by native drums.  Is her patient's strange condition the result of voodoo?

Although the film suffers from an occasional plot hole, it is easily one of the most stylish horror films of the 20th century.  Like all Lewton films, the direction, performances, and script are low key--but the tone is at once romantic and chilling, a strange tropical melange buttressed by Lewton's remarkable eye for black and white design.  While the film print is not pristine, it is reasonably good and probably represents a best-case situation.  Unfortunately, the commentary by film historians Kim Newman and Steve Jones tends to be excessively chatty; even so, it can be remarkably informative.

Released in 1945, THE BODY SNATCHER often vies with I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE for critical approval.  Directed by Robert Wise (who also directed Lewton's CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE), the film clearly has a larger budget and a tighter script than most Lewton movies--and this is due to the presence of a star: Boris Karloff, an actor with whom Lewton did not originally want to work; after meeting him, however, Lewton realized Karloff's true potential as a serious actor, and Karloff would make three films for Lewton.

Loosely based on the Robert Louis Stevenson story which was itself suggested by the notorious Burke and Hare case.  In an era when bodies were available for medical purposes, Dr. MacFarlaine (Henry Daniell) relies on grave-robber John Gray (Karloff) for specimens--and MacFarlaine soon involves protege Russel Wade (Donald Fettes) in the traffic.  But it happens that Gray is not very fastidious when it comes to acquiring cadavers, and murder is the result.

Some critics complain that BODY SNATCHER is excessively literal in comparison with other Lewton films, but the strength of the film is actually rests upon its remarkably cool, clinical feel.  Everything about the film is completely believable.  The cast is flawless, and if there was every any doubt about Karloff's skill as an actor this film erases it: his performance is fascinating, and although you quickly learn to loathe Gray--but try as you might, you cannot deny his humanity.  Daniell is equally fine in what would his most memorable role.  And then there is Bela Lugosi.

Lugosi, of course, had been a major horror star of the 1930s and had often co-starred with Karloff, with THE BLACK CAT perhaps their most memorable pairing.  But Lugosi's accent limited the roles he could play, and by 1945 his career had taken a downturn from which it would never recover.  Lugosi was hired for this film for the sake of publicity--a sort of ""together again!"" campaign--but although he received second billing the role of Joseph, Dr. MacFarlane's servant, was actually quite small.  Even so, Lugosi proves extremely memorable, and it is difficult to imagine the film without him.  It was the last time he would appear with Karloff, who by all accounts was very sensitive to Lugosi's situation during filming.  Karloff and Lugosi would never work together again, and Lugosi quick declined into obscurity.

The print of THE BODY SNATCHER is not pristine, but it is very fine, and the excellent commentary is divided between director Robert Wise and film historian Steve Haberman; Wise provides comments on both his own career and his work with Lewton, while Haberman's remarks are particular to the film.  Original trailers for I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and THE BODY SNATCHER round out the DVD.  This DVD is also available in the five disk box set THE VAL LEWTON HORROR COLLECTION, which I also recommend.

34704,5,078065062X,"A wonderful double-feature DVD featuring two greats from legendary genre producer Val Lewton.

  -------

I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943)

Purportedly based on Charlotte Bronte's novel JANE EYRE, this typically low-key Lewton chiller stars pretty Frances Dee as a Canadian nurse assigned to care for the semi-comatose wife of a plantation owner.  Not really a horror film--but fascinating nonetheless--this one's a gloomy yet well-acted melodrama that uses the voodoo-steeped Caribbean island of San Sebastian as a backdrop.  Jacques Tourneur's haunting direction, J. Roy Hunt's rich black-and-white cinematography, and Roy Webb's calypso-inspired score create a very otherworldly atmosphere, and actor Darby Jones' portrayal of an emaciated, bug-eyed island native--who may or may not be a zombie--is disturbingly unforgettable.

  -------

THE BODY SNATCHER (1945)

This literate adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson story stars genre great Boris Karloff as a 19th-century grave robber who turns to murder in order to meet the local med school's quota for cadavers to dissect.  Karloff delivers what is arguably one of his best performances, and Bela Lugosi does equally well in a less prominent secondary role.  The film is also notable for being one of the first genre directorial efforts from Robert Wise, who would later direct such genre classics as THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (1951), THE HAUNTING (1963), THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN (1971), and STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE (1979), as well as some non-genre greats like WEST SIDE STORY (1961) and THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965).

  -------

The double-feature disc from Warner offers both movies their original 1.33:1 format, and though neither appears to have received any restoration, the condition of both is pretty good considering their age (THE BODY SNATCHER is in the best shape by comparison).  Each flick is paired with its theatrical trailer, and both are accompanied by optional feature-length commentaries.  The commentary on THE BODY SNATCHER is from the late director Robert Wise, possibly the last one he worked on prior to his death in September of 2005.

All in all, this disc is well worth the reasonable price of admission and is a must-have for any serious film collector.",1128988800,12,2244,5.336182336182336
34705,5,078065062X,"These are two of Lewton's Classic films, though a wee bit mismatched.

""I Walked with a Zombie"" must win the award for the most ridiculous title for a super movie.  During a period when screenwriters were on strike they had to keep making movies, so they turned to the classics.  In this one they took Jane Eyre and moved it to the tropics and added a sprinkle of Voodoo and came out with a very atmospheric film.  Any young film director looking to learn the technique of evocative atmosphere needs to start here.  This movie oozes a melancholy ambiance that is more sinister than horror.  One my my favourite all time films.

The second, they dusted off and trotted out was a Robert Lewis Stephenson tale about evil-doings in the period of body snatching.  A very understated yet menacing Karloff is the sinister body snatcher willing to provide a young doctor the much needed corpses he needs for his medical experiments - even if they are still alive and protesting.  It's a very understate film, no sensational acting.  Costuming for the period Scotland it's wonderful.  Excellent direction from the master Robert Wise.

There are theatrical trailers, it has subtitles in England, French and Spanish (but on the feature films only).  Also included are commentary by Film Historians Kim Newman and Steve Jones for Zombie and Steve Haberman for Body Snatcher.

These are two of the very best Lewton films.  Not to be missed for the power of each does not lessen with time.",1128988800,11,1475,4.774703557312253
34706,4,078065062X,"I haven't seen ""The Body Snatcher"", but I think this could perhaps be a stylistical mismatch: in fact, ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is not a mainstream horror movie; it is rather a psychological and dreamlike thriller.

A no wasted time film which limitation allows the Director not to tarry lovingly over scenes.
The Body Snatcher, stars, in the title role, the inimitable Boris Karloff, and features, Bela Lugosi, the idol of Horror, in a supporting role.  Henry Daniell, another highly accomplished actor, co-stars with a strong performance as the Physician with a past. Karloff and Daniell, in  their roles as antagonists, raise this B picture to a level above most far more expensive A features. This film alone is worth the price of admission despite the weakness of the main supporting role, a student of  Master Physician and Teacher, Daniell.

The Body Snatcher is one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on May 25, 1945. The story is about a body snatcher (played by Boris Karloff) who digs up dead bodies and sell them to Dr. Wolfe MacFarlane so he can use them in his anatomy classes. Cabman John Gray (the body snatcher) starts killing so Dr. Wolfe MacFarlane an adequate spinal specimen to practice for an upcoming operation on a child's back. When he finds out that the dead woman is the street singer and that Gray has also killed Joseph, Wolfe feels he must stop Gray. Also Gray has a secret about Dr. Wolfe that he uses for blackmail. Dr. Wolfe visits Gray to bribe him to just go away and refuses the bribe. A fight develops and Dr. Wolfe kills John Gray.

This movie would mark the last time that Boris Karloff and Bla Lugosi would be pared together. Some of the scenes were left over sets from the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The only thing I did not like about this movie was the commentary by Steve Haberman and Robert Wise. Robert Wise more or less talks about his career with RKO and Val Lewton and Steve Haberman talks about the movie but only for fifteen minutes of the film though he is on longer. The Body Snatcher is a good suspense horror film and gets an AAAA++++.

to him on his Christmas birthday.  Now, he can scare himself silly again!",1358467200,,299,4.4
34739,5,078065062X,"Jacques Tourneur considered I Walked With A Zombie (1943) his best work. It is an assessment many critics agree with. It is, perhaps, the most apt of Halloween entries. Horror is not at its ripest in 7 foot tall hatchet-welding slashers, brain-eating zombies, or slickly produced libidinous teen-age vampires. Rather, it flourishes in the everyday. Horror is in the droves of people flocking to Wal-Mart to purchase torture porn dressed up as religious dogma, or in the self-made blinders we wear. Producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur knew this, and delivered a fascinating horror despite being handed one of the most idiotic film titles in cinema history (clearly taken from a pulp source).

Betsy (Frances Dee),  a Canadian nurse, has taken a position on the island of St. Sebastian. Betsy's blinders prevent her from hearing. When a black driver transports her to the Holland plantation, he tells her how slaves were acquired and brought here: ""Well, they certainly brought you to a pretty island,"" is all she can muster. When she meets her employer, Paul Holland (Tom Conway), he pierces her illusions: ""There is no beauty here, the water's illumination comes from death."" Conway, with his sensual, rich voice, narrates in such a way that Betsy's love for this tragic figure seems reasonable.

Betsy is to care for Holland's wife, Jessica (Christine Gordon), who is the title's alleged zombie (the opening voice over plays humorously with the title the studio saddled the producers with). Paul's alcoholic brother Wesley (James Ellison) evades his own guilt and harbors a grudge for imagined ills. The plot is loosely based off a literary source: ""Jane Eyre,"" with Paul Holland substituting for Rochester. Surprisingly, Hollywood hack Curt Siodmak assisted Ardel Wray in writing the screenplay. The film feels more in line with Wray's other credits (which include Lewton's 1943 Leopard Man and 1945 Isle of the Dead).

Even the film's phantasmagoric qualities are filtered through the poetry of concrete reality. The symbology of the sacrificial St. Sebastian manifests in Betsy. Betsy falls hook line and sinker to the local voodoo lore, fed to her by Jessica's maid, Alma (Teresa Harris). Although Betsy loves Paul, she is willing to sacrifice her love when she takes his wife Jessica to a voodoo priest for a cure. The ceremony itself is filmed kinetically. The natives are as nave as Betsy and Wesley, having inherited the misogynistic framework of colonial society and transposed it onto the perennial Eve, Jessica. A frequent theme with Lewton is his refusal to see death solely as a negative. The ambiguous watery catacomb is more gifted relief as opposed to undesired finale.

Tourneur and Lewton's I Walked With A Zombie is a poetic philter, far removed from Romero's fantasy apocalypses.

When Val Lewton discovered that RKO was saddling him with star Boris Karloff for a three picture deal, Lewton was not at all happy. The producer had wanted to veer away from the Universal monster-mash factory, which he naturally associated Karloff with. A meeting between Karloff, Lewton, and Robert Wise changed all that. To Lewton's surprise, Karloff was seeking a change of pace and a return to more literate acting. By the end of that meeting, both Lewton and Wise were charmed by the actor and enthusiastically looking forward to a fulfilling artistic collaboration. Karloff did three films with Lewton, the other two being Isle of the Dead (1945) and Bedlam (1946) both directed by Mark Robson, a stock RKO director. Lewton should never have hesitated. The Body Snatcher is, easily, the best of the three starring Karloff and the actor almost single-handedly redeems the two Robson films.

Shortly after securing Karloff  for The Body Snatcher, RKO signed Bela Lugosi to the film and ordered Lewton to create a role for the former Dracula star. RKO was bound and determined to replicate a Universal horror star extravaganza. Lewton was just as determined to give them something better. Karloff graciously accepted working with his former co-star (this would be their last teaming) and would prove helpful to Lugosi during shooting. While Karloff proved as rewarding an actor as Lewton and Wise hoped he would be, Lugosi's casting proved problematic. Although Lugosi did turn in one of his few good latter-day performances, the actor's mental and physical health (a combination of age, drugs, and alcoholism) was a considerable obstacle.

Robert Wise co-directed Curse of the Cat People (1944), but The Body Snatcher was his first solo effort. The film features two superb star performances and several very good character performances, including Lugosi's. The Body Snatcher, in its pronounced literalness, may lack Lewton favorite Jacques Tourneur`s poetic aesthetic, but Wise's fleshier terrain gleans benefits.

Body Snatcher is an adaptation of a Robert Louise Stevenson short story which Val Lewton scripted (under his pseudonym, Carlos Keith) with Philip MacDonald. The film is inspired by and loosely based on the infamous Burke and Hare murders.

Karloff's performance here is, rightly, one of his most critically acclaimed. Henry Daniel, one of the great character actors, is precision par excellence. The Body Snatcher is an actors' film, and the two character stars deliver.

Cabman John Gray (Karloff) and Dr. Toddy McFarland (Daniel) are the ambiguous antagonist and protagonist. McFarland is essentially moral, socially accepted, but chillingly cold and obsessively driven to criminal activities. Gray is a social outcast. He is malevolent, manipulative, capable of brutality, blackmail, and murder. Yet, he has a fire in his heart that McFarland lacks.

It's not even quite that cut and dry. This is Edinburgh in the Victorian era, when celibacy was proof of vocational dedication. McFarland's celibacy is a facade. He has a secret wife, Meg (Edith Atwater), who poses as his maid. Meg is a seer, with the gift of vision and fire in her bosom. This relationship, so subtly presented, is the heart of McFarland's hypocrisy and tragedy.

Gray is equally complex. He savagely brings a shovel down on the skull of an interruptive dog, yet is capable of tenderness when caressing the cheek of his horse, or petting his cat (after committing murder). Gray has affection for a crippled girl but, without an iota of remorse, murders a blind balladeer (an effective scene, shot in Lewtonesque shadows) to supply the cadaver for the girl's much-needed surgery.

Lewton and Wise astutely play to Lugosi's limitations, taking advantage of his language difficulty. Lugosi, as the blackmailing servant Joseph, is slow-witted, slow of speech and slow to grasp what's happening. Lugosi's best directors played to his awkward delivery. Some have criticized the brevity of Lugosi's role here (including Lugosi himself). But it is that brevity which gives power to Lugosi's role. The role Joseph stands alongside the actor's best character work. Lugosi's death scene with Karloff is expertly directed and acted.

Atwater projects strongly in her role. Hers are the needs of a fully rounded woman, her passions and visions aflame underneath the icy exterior McFarland demands of her. She fulfills that role without complaint, self-pity, or self-deceit.

However, the film falters considerably in the roles of McFarland's assistant Fettes (Russell Wade), the crippled girl Georgina (Sharyn Moffett) and her mother (Rita Corday). These are contrived, saccharine characters.

The finale, straight out of the Stevenson story, is harrowing and sears the conscience.

34740,3,078065062X,"Here are two movies from the nine horror films did for RKO Studios in the 1940's. Lewton was hired to produce a series of B horror films for RKO to compete with Universal Studios highly profitable horror and monster films. What RKO was something different. Lewton created films with psychological terror rather than using monsters and the supernatural.

As with I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, Lewton was only given a title to use and the rest was his creation. Although I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE does touch the issues of voodoo and zombies, it again, as in all Lewton films, a study of fear of the unknown. The lovely Frances Dee plays Betsy a nurse sent to work at a plantation house in the Caribbean Island of San Sebastian carrying for the ill wife of the owner. Emotionally detached Paul Holland is played by Ton Conway.  Conway appears in several Lewton films and San Sebastian comes up again in another film. Troubled Wesley Rand is Paul's half brother. Betsy arrives to find Jessica Holland in a catatonic state. She does not speak or react to anyone but is prone to getting up and walking. Locals fear she is a cursed zombie though the local doctor explains her condition as the result of a virulant Caribbean fever that destroyed her mind. Betsy's medical mind is taken over by local superstition as she believes only a voodoo priest can ""cure"" Jessica.

Here again we have a Lewton film centering on the fear of the unknown. What is the truth about Jessica's condition and what about the secret voodoo ceremonies. I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is a psychological thriller and not really a horror film. Everything can be explained scientifically or can it? Sir Lancelot appears in several Lewton films and here he is singing the story of Jessica and her fate. I had never heard of Sir Lancelot but I found out he was a popular Calypso singer who actually popularized this Caribbean form of singing.

I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is compared to Jane Eyre. I can see similarities though the stories diverge completely. Again, we have a servant or nurse in this case who comes to a mysterious household and falls in love with her boss.
Can there be a happy ending with this background? It's an interesting film to watch simply because it is so different. I hadn't heard of Francess Dee and found she was married to actor Joel McCrea. There is a lot of history in old films.

Boris Karloff stars in one of the more creepier and unnerving of the Val Lewton films. There is no mystery here. Karloff stars in the title role of THE BODY SNATCHER. This evil and sinister role gave Karloff a chance to show his acting talents. Evil can also have a tender side as we see Karloff's body snatcher showing kindness to an invalid girl. Yet his sinister side reigns as he supplies bodies for a medical doctor's anatomy classes. Although it is based on a ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON book there is some general historical fact here. What happens when a grave robber has no ""fresh"" bodies to dig up? Working on a very modest budget, Lewton uses the shadows and fear of the unknown to scare our viewers. Often the violence is only suggested, but what is happening is very clear. Bela Lugosi also costars in THE BODY SNATCHER. It's a dark film where even supposedly good people have other motives. A seriously creepy scene occurs when the doctor transfers a body in his carriage. Simple idea with seriously creepy and unnerving overtones.",1347840000,,3398,4.619205298013245
34741,5,078065062X,"These are two of the best films by the Lewton team. I walked with a Zombie is one of the best  horror films made in the 40s. It is a tragic tale and there are no heros or villans only victims.

I have watched this film many times and still enjoy every time.
The Body Snatchers is a great film with Karloff procuring dead bodies for Henry Daniel. The two play off each other wonderfully It is some of the best acting in film period.

34742,5,078065062X,"I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE

Directed by Jacques Tourneur, I Walked with a Zombie is a classic Val Lewton production relying on good script writing, solid acting, engaging set designs, and the viewer's imagination and fears rather than big production values.  Lewton was the original master of creating memorable horror film hits with very little money and time and presented a nice contrast to the big budget films that preceded him.  I Walked with a Zombie is a rather obscured gem of 1940s cinema, but it is a great film that deserves accolades.

The film focuses on Betsy, a nurse hired to travel to a beautiful Caribbean island to care for the sick wife of a wealthy sugar plantation owner, Paul Holland.  At first, Betsy is enamored with the sheer contrast and beauty of the island and its people in comparison to her native Canada.  It's tropical, exotic, filled with warmth, unusual plants and animals, and friendly, interesting people--the sort of place people pay good money to vacation in, but her initial feelings are quickly dampened.

Mr. Holland explains the terrible past of the island, that it was born of misery, built by slaves whose lives meant little to the plantation owners.  Everywhere the relics of this slavery stand out like sulking ghosts of the past.  The natives still morn when a child is born and make merry when a person dies, testament to the awful burdens of life on the island.  To think the past long gone is a mistake, for the link from the days of terrible slavery to the modern are not so long as to heal the wounds of the past.

Indeed, it seems that all the sorrows have caused some psychic residue that permeates the island corrupting the souls of its inhabitants, for even as Betsy looks closer at her employee and ward, she learns that dark secrets exist.  There is talk that Paul caused his wife's illness, that his brother coveted her and now turns to alcohol to settle his woes.  And behind it all is the incessant beating of the voodoo drums, a beating that seems to imply that something big is about to happen.

It's a complex story, one that isn't just about scary monsters or magical spells.  Behind all the action is a constant psychological back-story that really engages you with the main characters and builds to something at the end.  Much like everything else in the movie, you're never entirely sure what is real and what is not, what is truth and what is fiction.  Everybody has their own version of the events unfolding, even the local town calypso singer!  There is a great deal of balance throughout, an opposite for everything.  The two bothers are opposites, there is modern medicine existing along side voodoo ritual.  It keeps you continually guessing and especially from making judgment on anything that you see.

And there is much to see.  Besides getting intimate insight into the Holland family, you are also given a look at the voodoo practice itself in a brilliantly done sequence that builds terrific suspense as Betsy decides to intrude on the ritual one lonely night.  It is the crescendo of tension in the film, a tension that never goes away from start to finish when you combine the ill condition of the Holland family with the eeriness of the voodoo practices and the evil history of the whole island.

Yet, the film also never dehumanizes any of the characters or the voodoo practitioners.  One of the more admirable attributes of Lewton unique for his time was his ability to portray people fairly, not in black and white.  His depiction of the native black population deserves some mention, as they are treated quite fairly instead of as uneducated savages typical of Hollywood at the time.

It's a truly brilliant film, one that will spark your interest and keep with you for a long time.  It is a well-put together drama with little actual horror (although lots of gothic imagery) although like everything else, what is really supernatural and what is not is left completely up to the viewer and is never fully revealed.",1327276800,,4000,4.733044733044733
34743,5,078065062X,"More than anyone else at that time (30s-40s), Val Lewton was intrigued (obsessed?) with the exploration of the tortured soul, the sinner who longs for redemption but is pressed by character and circumstance on a path of destruction. These two movies are some of the best examples of this (Cat People is another standout). Lewton created amazing films out of nothing--he had almost no budget and only scraps of a cheesy script foisted on him by RKO, who wanted nothing more than a quick buck. But perhaps this worked to his advantage--Lewton really had no choice but to focus on characters and situations, and had very few parameters to follow, except to stay on budget.

In both of these movies, you'll see very little in terms of monsters, violence and gore--Lewton got around using special effects with brilliant uses of shadows and suggestion. What you will see are rich characters torn apart by love, duty, madness, and the secrets of the past. These are movies not just for horror fans, but anyone who enjoys a movie that works on multiple levels, and challenges them to ask questions about the blurry lines between what is morally right and wrong. They're movies you can watch again and again, and see new details, new connections each time.

Val Lewton should be part of any horror fan's collection, and these two movies are essential to own.",1299801600,2,1349,4.810344827586207
34744,5,078065062X,"If you've heard of producer Val Lewton's reputation but balk at buying the box set of his RKO movies, this DVD should fit the bill nicely. Lewton produced thoughtful and psychologically-oriented supernatural melodramas that RKO marketed as horror films but which had little in common with what Universal and Columbia were doing simultaneously. These are handsome films that are intelligently written, feature strong performances, and a quality look that belies their status as moderately budgeted B-movies. If you like the 1940s style of serious melodramas but also have a passion for the supernatural, these films are probably what you'll enjoy.

""I Walked With a Zombie"" is one of Lewton's best-known productions (although probably more for the truly lurid true confession-style title than for actual audience familiarity!) and is essentially a loose adaptation of Jane Eyre transplanted to a tropical island. If the movie had a different title, it might have more than a cult reputation. To me, this film can stand toe-to-toe with other, higher-budgeted ""classic fiction"" adaptations from the same era as it is exceptionally handsome. This is mostly a romantic melodrama with a supernatural subtext, but has a couple of extended and moody terror scenes that are jolting. If you're familiar with Caribbean voudou traditions, you'll like this film but you'll be sorely disappointed if you want Romero-style hungry undead.

""The Body Snatcher"" is a far creepier film that, ironically, has less to do with the supernatural and more with our revulsion toward ghoulish behavior. It looks just as good as ""I Walked With a Zombie"" and has a melodramatic subplot, but can boast Boris Karloff as a subversive grave robber who provides a medical researcher with cadavers. I've always respected Karloff's work from his Universal days as Frankenstein's Monster to his 1960s films when he was ultimately wheelchair-bound and I never thought of him as limited actor by any means. But I had no idea just how good he was until I saw him portray Cabman Grey in this film. This could have been a one-note hammy performance, but Karloff lends the character not just the expected villany and ghoulishness but also a depth of humanity that makes him even more disturbing and unforgettable. Cabman Grey may not be a ""monster"" in the sense of a Frankenstein's monster, but he will frighten you and you will not be able to forget him no matter how hard you try. You will never again dismiss Karloff as dependent upon heavy makeup to offer up scares. To me, ""The Body Snatcher"" is the very best film that Val Lewton produced, even above ""The Cat People.""

I strongly recommend this DVD for the collection of anyone who loves 1940s films, classic tales of the uncanny, or both.",1296086400,2,2753,5.032894736842105

It is a short nasty little tale about the Body Snatching game along the lines of Burke and Hare.  Karloff and Henry Daniel have a wonderful chemistry.  Lugosi is listed high on the credits, but he has a very small roll, though again his scene with Karloff is mesmerizing.  If you are a horror fan or just a fan of good movies I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  You will never forget Gray the Cabman.  The second movie should not be dismissed or forgotten.

34757,5,078065062X,"A nurse is assigned to the wife of a rich sugar planter in the West Indies, a woman who has lost all personal will and consciousness as a result of permanent damage brought on by a tropical fever. The nurse is thrust into a lover's quarrel between the plantation owner and his brother as she attempts to cure the emotionless ""zombie"" before finally turning to a voodoo priest as a last chance at revival. Tourneur demonstrates masterful visual storytelling throughout the film, using stark contrasts, fluid camera movements, and graphic metaphors to decorate the already engaging plot. The cold, empty, but beautiful plantation house reflects the lifeless walking corpse of Mrs. Holland in just one of many visual clues left through the film. Unlike the typically insulting voodoo ceremonies included in other films of the time, Tourneur offers a respectful and artful representation of voodoo ritualism in a beautifully shot sequence where the servants put Mrs. Holland through a series of trials to see if she is one of the undead. Christine Gordon's deathly white complexion and flowing garbs give her a ghost-like and otherworldly appearance that maintains an eerie mood. Many of the more suspenseful scenes are devoid of any score, which makes them all the more frightening in the overpowering silence broken only by the rustling wind. I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is not a typical Horror movie, focusing much more on the character interactions and love triangles than the scares, but it is an excellent Gothic Horror entry outside of the typical Universal monster films of the 1940s.

Quick synopsis: A nurse is hired to watch over a mental patient on a mysterious island. The patient is in a zombie-like state and the nurse is desperate to cure her. A love triangle ensues between the nurse, the patient's husband, and the husband's half brother. The island natives want the patient to themselves, as they believe she is a real zombie, resulting from voodoo.
The movie has a decent pace, with lots of gothic romance, dark foreshadowing, mystery, and great sets. I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, although the ending seemed anti-climactic for the slow buildup created throughout the film.
The quality of the footage was pretty good. Some slight shaky scenes and small scratches throughout, not bad though. The audio was fantastic. The dvd includes optional subtitles, which is great for catching those few lines you may have missed. It also includes a commentary and a theatrical trailer for the film.
I'd recommend this highly for fans old romance and mysteries.

One of the nine ""horror"" films produced at RKO in the early to mid-40's by Val Lewton, widely acknowledged as the ""Father of the Psychological Horror Film"". Lewton's guiding principle was that the thing that we fear the most is the, ""unknown"". Hitchcock's, PSYCHO, owes much to Lewton's approach to making a ""horror"" movie. The script is based on a short story by Robert Louis Stevenson. Boris Karloff stars as the title character, a grave-robber who provides cadavers for a doctor(Daniell) who runs a medical school. When the supply of corpses who have died natural deaths begins to run low, Karloff resorts to murder. One particularly effective example of Lewton's approach to making this type of film has to do with Karloff's murder of a young, blind ""street singer"". We see her walking down a deserted street, closely followed by Karloff in his horse drawn cart---they disappear into the dark--- a few seconds later, the girl's singing suddenly ceases---in the next scene, we see Karloff delivering the body to Daniell's medical school---it's creepy. As the film unfolds, we learn that Karloff and Daniell have a lengthy personal history and that Daniell is morally conflicted about having to deal with a, ""crawling graveyard rat"", like Karloff. We learn that Karloff was born poor and has had to, ""bow and scrape"", to the more affluent all his life. He enjoys the power he has to ""ruin"" an upper-class individual like Daniell, if he so chooses. This is one of three films that Karloff made with Lewton(the other two were: BEDLAM and ISLE OF THE DEAD), and he gives a nicely nuanced performance---one of his best(IMO)---we are, by turns, repelled by his character and sympathetic to him. Lugosi has a very small role as Daniell's assistant who makes the mistake of trying to blackmail Karloff---it was the last film in which Karloff and Lugosi appeared together. Predictably, the conflict between Karloff and Daniell provides the climax of the film. IMO, this is one of the best of the films that comprise the, ""Val Lewton cycle""---I recommend this film to fans of ""psychological horror"" movies. All nine Lewton films are available in a reasonably priced box set, with an additional hour long documentary on Lewton's career---a worthy addition to any film library.",1257638400,2,2425,5.110831234256927
34760,4,078065062X,"I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE is producer Val Lewton's second horror picture.  The story is told from Betsy's voiceover in the beginning of the story.  Betsy is a nurse who accepts a job in the Caribbean.  When she arrives the island seems beautiful enough, in fact even on the ship there everything is beautiful to Betsy, although her new boss assures that things are not as beautiful as they seem.  And that everything is death.  It is after this encounter that Betsy admits to liking Mr. Paul Holland.

THE BODY SNATCHER was based on the short story by Robert Louis Stevenson and it seemed based on the murders of Burke and Hare. (which is an interesting piece of morbid history).  Dr. McFarlane and Dr. Fettes are working at school where anatomical and medical research and education is done.  McFarlane has an associate who retireves recently buried bodies from the graves in order to supply the researchers with fesh cadavers.

Well a young woman comes to ask for Dr. Mcfarlane's help on a medical project that only he can help her with.  Dr. McFarlane refuses, only because he doesn't have a cadaver to practice on.  So in an effort to help Fettes asks the grave robber Gray (Karloff) to get them another body as soon as he can.  Gray needs the money and instead he kills someone to supply the docotors with their cadaver.  And so the creepiness really begins.

I enjoyed the Body Snatchers more out of the two.  I especially enjoyed the burking between Karloff and Lugosi.  Lugosi has a smaller role as one of the janitors and the school or facility, but all in all and enjoyable duo.",1238544000,,2021,4.58659217877095
34761,4,078065062X,"This disk includes two feature films, both produced by Val Lewton in the mid 1940's. In that time period Lewton produced a handful of horror movies for RKO Studios, of which these are two. Lewton used several directors and writers for these movies, but they all share a similar literary quality and eschew the shock and scare of other horror movies of the time for a more creepy and atmospheric experience.

""I walked With a Zombie"" is not nearly as lurid as the title would suggest, it is a well done melodrama with an exotic locale and voodoo. It is very loosely based on the novel ""Jane Eyre"".

""The Body Snatcher"" is based on a Robt. L. Stevenson story and is the better of the two movies. Like ""Zombie"", it is not a true horror picture, except in the psychological sense. ""Body Snatcher"" packs a real wallop, Boris Karloff and Henry Daniell are excellent, and Bela Lugosi is wasted in a minor role.

A fine disk and two good movies. The other Val Lewton pics in this series are also good. ""The Cat People"", ""Curse of the Cat People"", and ""Isle of the Dead"" are the others I remember. I think there are several others.

Bottom line: These movies melded horror and melodrama and are very nicely written, produced and directed. They also have a certain literary quality about them that gives them an appeal outside of the horror genre.",1217635200,2,1337,4.558333333333334
34762,4,078065062X,"""I Walked with a Zombie"" (1943) is the latest film I've seen in my attempt to review every zombie movie ever made.  I am not reviewing this through the eyes of a film enthusiast trying to understand the brilliance of one of Val Lewton's masterpieces.  Rather, I'm going to attempt to review the film more through the eyes of a person fanatically obsessed with all things ""zombie"" (though, that is not to imply that I am a merely a philistine).  The story is of nurse, Betsy Connell, who was sent to a Caribbean island to help a plantation owner care for his catatonic wife.  Add a couple of love triangles and some voodoo into the mix, and those are the ingredients for a great picture.

""I Walked with a Zombie"" is an interesting conundrum for zombie fans.  It is a more traditional zombie story, which ends up making it an unconventional zombie movie by modern standards.  In the pre-Romero and pre-Ossorio era, zombie movies such as this one usually stick close to their Haitian voodoo roots.  They are either a loved one or brought back from the dead or a slave used to carry out mischievous deeds, as opposed to the infectious creatures out to eat brains.  The zombies in this movie carry a double meaning.  They are both the traditional Haitian ""risen from the dead"" zombies, but they also refer to people who are mentally comatose.  Though I have a love for the modern zombie films, I have a deep appreciation for this older and more traditional version of the zombie story.

For a film made in the 1940's, there is not going to be a lot of the stereotypical things people look for in zombie movies.  There is no bloody gore, and there is no blatant sexism of 70's nudity.  At the same time, considering it was made in the 40's. the film is very risqu&eacute;.  Though ""I Walked with a Zombie"" is lacking in what many are used to in modern zombie movies, the film more than makes up for it by having something that many modern zombie films lack: great dialog, a compelling plot, and amazing direction.  The conversation at the opening of the film between nurse Betsy and the plantation owner is probably some of the most brilliant dialog ever put in a film with ""zombie"" in a title.  ""Everything seems beautiful because you don't understand. Those flying fish, they're not leaping for joy, they're jumping in terror. Bigger fish want to eat them. That luminous water, it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies. The glitter of putrescence. There is no beauty here, only death and decay [...] Everything good dies here. Even the stars.""  A phenomenal speech that really sets the somber tone of the film.

Jacques Tourneur's direction was amazing. The scene when Betsy first encounters her patient is frightening.  The scene when Betsy brings her  patient to the voodoo ceremony is dreamy and memorable.

I believe there are two drawbacks to the movie.  First is that the romance between the nurse and the plantation owner seems entirely tacked on.  It really comes out of nowhere, and isn't supported by any of the scenes in the movie.  At the same time, in the 40's they had to be very careful about the Production Code, and showing a married man romantically interested in another woman while he had a sick wife would have been difficult.

My second issue with the movie is debatable, as to whether it is a drawback.  This is difficult to gage by a person watching a movie 65 years past it's time, but it seems like there is a certain level of (unintentional?) racism in the movie.  This first hit me when an old islander is bringing Betsy to the plantation and is telling her about, ""The enormous boat brought the long-ago fathers and the long-ago mothers of us all...chained to the bottom of the boat,"" to which Betsy replies, """"They brought you to a beautiful place, didn't they?""  I cringed at that.  It's like saying, ""Sure, your ancestors were slaves taken from their homes, and most probably died on the boat over, but at least they were taken to a place with a beach and palm trees.""  It struck me as rather callous.  Also, all of the island people seem to be stereotypically superstitious and ""simple folks"".  On the other side of the argument I've read articles, and even seen a documentary by Martin Scorsese, that discuss how if ""I Walked With A Zombie"" is considered in the context of the early 1940's, that it is actually an anti-racist movie.  Those articles talk about how even the mention of slave ships was a bold move in the 40's, and how Betsy's callous response would have been accurate for the character.  The articles also have a very different take on the portrayal of island people than I did.  They describe the movie's portrayal of the Caribbean people and their religious practice as ""extraordinarily accurate"" and ""respectful"", and ""free of the racial stereotypes"".  It's is a complex issue of the film, and each viewer will have to form their own opinion.  I know I change my opinion from day to day.  If it means anything, the film was purportedly immensely popular with African American audiences when it was released.

Those issues aside, I find this to be a thoroughly enjoyable movie and give ""I Walked with a Zombie""  a 8/10 on my zombie movie rating scale.  Though many zombie fanatics may be put-off by the more traditional take on the genre, I can't imagine anyone not being able to appreciate this movie.  As a sign of a truly good zombie film, it is a movie that has appeal for everyone, and not simply those who are zombie fanatics.

""The Body Snatcher"" (1945): as a bonus, the movie is on the same DVD as Val Lewton and Robert Wise's adaptation of Robert Lewis Stevenson's ""The Body Snatcher"".  ""The Body Snatcher"" is the story of a medical professor who hires a grave robber to keep supplying him with fresh corpses.  The professor wants to get out of it, but the grave robber starts to black mail him, and carries things too far.  It's a great film, and chance to see actor Boris Karloff do some fantastic work as the grave robber.  Also, there's a rare scene of Karloff and Bela Lugosi going head to head.  A movie definitely worth the time: 8/10.",1205884800,3,6111,4.603512014787431
34763,5,078065062X,"These are two of the finest films of the very fine Val Lewton Collection. I walked with a Zombie is, oddly enough, a very elegant treatment of the walking dead. Lewton's favorite director, Jacques Tourneur, was at the helm, giving the subject the correct weight and just enough darkness. No one in the history of film could have made this movie but Val Lewton.

Think of it: RKO studios came to Lewton and gave him a title - I Walked With A Zombie - with directions to make a quick, effective zombie flick to cash in on the horror craze (the studio was still getting over the money pit Orson Wells had dug for them with his Citizen Kane, which was very poorly attended). Val Lewton took the title and produced a quick, effective (and money-making) retelling of Bronte's Jane Eyre set in Haiti with zombies. To call Lewton ""imaginative"" doesn't quite cover it. As was always the case with Lewton, whose involvement in a picture was often greater than the typical ""producer"", this film is very unsettling and truly scary with only minimal special effects. The Body Snatcher is my favorite Lewton film, and it contains my very favorite Boris Karloff performance of a long and glorious career full of great performances. Karloff plays the grave robber, Cabman Gray. As was always the case with Karloff, his subtle performance gave his villainous character a human side. Karloff always took the time as an actor to bring dimensions to his character, as in this film when he apologizes to his horse for having to take her out again on an unsavory mission - ""bad news ."" says Karloff, who seems truly sad, as he strokes the horse's head and describes the night's work ahead of them; or when he stands over a freshly killed body and gently - absentmindedly - strokes his nearby pet cat.

Karloff was always the master of the lethal, burning stare behind the silky voice that suggested terrible things. Yet, all of Karloff's ""monsters"" were always very, very human - particularly Frankenstein",1199059200,2,1983,4.728323699421965

34766,5,078065062X,"The Body Snatcher (Robert Wise, 1945)

The great Robert Wise, protege of Orson Welles (he edited Citizen Kane and acted as assistant director on The Magnificent Ambersons)  who went on to direct some of America's most loved and respected movies, was not above dipping his bloody talons into the horror genre now and again. When he did, the results were usually phenomenal; he was the mind behind 1963's The Haunting, often cited by critics as one of the best horror movies ever made, as well as 1944's The Curse of the Cat People, the sequel to Jacques Tourneur's genre-bending classic. The Body Snatcher, though, is perhaps the best of Wise's forays into horror, despite such things as the disquieting lack of a Scots accent in people who were supposedly born and bred in Edinburgh. Well, you can't have everything. What you do get, among other things, is the last onscreen pairing of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and if that's not enough to bring you to the table, I don't know what is.

Karloff plays John Gray, cab driver by day, body snatcher by night. One of his clients is Toddy MacFarlane (Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea's Henry Daniell), an arrogant doctor who thinks he has Gray under his thumb. The dynamic of power seems to change when MacFarlane hires a young, idealistic assistant, Donald Fettes (veteran character actor Russell Wade), who's not at all fond of Gray. When Fettes uncovers Gray's secret for obtaining bodies on the quick, he and MacFarlane have to figure out how to get rid of Gray for good.

Lugosi, as MacFarlane's servant Joseph, doesn't get a great deal of screen time here, which is a shame. Still, what he has is great, and Karloff's smooth-talking Gray is a sight to behold. Val Lewton's screenplay is based on a Robert Lewis Stevenson short story (loosely, of course, as most Lewton scripts were loose), and is Lewton's usual quality work. The film does have a few minor pacing problems-- Wise was not yet as proficient with the slow, talky scene as was his mentor-- but they pale in comparison to the quality of the rest of the film. This is fine, fine stuff, a must for any student of the horror film. **** ",1190332800,3,2149,4.6596306068601585

7789769,4,078065062X,"""I Walked with a Zombie""

We are treated to exotic titles and expectations with titles such as ""I walked With a Zombie."" My only encounters with Zombies are those that process in an UNIX operating system that can not be killed. I also watched ""Weekend at Bernie's II.""

As with other Lewton productions he got a way with a psychological thriller in the guise of a monster movie. In the days of sailing ships a nurse (Frances Dee) is employed to go to San Sebastian to look after a plantation owner's wife (Christine Gordon.) She fined that her charge is more than just a victim of a disease that heft her without will. Turns out if you cut the wife she does not bleed. We all know what that means.

The true story is the relationship to man and wife, man and nurse, nurse and wife, brother and brother, brother and wife, need I say more? Could it mean that there is nothing supernatural or is love moving in mysterious natural.

Can this all be straightened out or is Jessica Holland the wife destined to be zomiated for ever and the nurse must learn to love from afar?

Yeah Lord pity them who are dead and give peace and happiness to the living.

""The Body Snatcher""
Based on a short story by Robert Louis Stevenson

""It is through error that a man tries and rises. It is through tragedy he learns. All the roads of learning begin in darkness and go out into the light."" Hippocrates of Gos

This film has the psychological complexity of a Val Lewton production but is a lot more graphic than most of his productions where he just implies violence. He even takes it out on innocent dogs. I feel that some one was pushing Lewton from behind to be more vicious with this film.

A young student (Russell Wade) wants to become a doctor like the great Dr. Wolfe 'Toddy' MacFarlane (Henry Daniell.) Little does he know what it will entail?

The DVD has a voiceover commentary from the late Director Robert Wise who directed ""West Side Story"" and ""The Sound of Music."" Surprisingly he said that the original basic script was written by Philip MacDonald.

7789770,5,078065062X,"For those who know him only as the voice of The Grinch in the Dr. Seuss holiday cartoon classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas, it might come as a surprise that actor Boris Karloff once populated the nightmares of millions of peopleadults and children alike.

Possibly Karloffs career-best performance is contained in this chilling little picture, set in 1828 Edinburgh and based loosely on a nifty little ghost story by Robert Louis Stevenson. 

Karloff plays John Grey, a coach driver who moonlights as a resurrectionista grave-robber, supplying cadavers illegally for research at a local medical college. An increasing demand for fresh bodies compels Grey to become more creative about his methods of securing corpses.

The Body Snatcher is the last of the eight pictures which teamed Karloff with his former horror rival Bela Lugosi. Lugosis falling star and growing morphine addiction reduced him to playing a small and nearly silent supporting role in this picture, as the blackmailing servant of Edinburghs most prominent surgeon. 

But The Body Snatcher is Karloffs show all the way, and should have earned him an Academy Awardthe actors talent and versatility is nothing short of astonishing, in a role which requires him to change from enormously sympathetic to terrifyingly murderoussometimes within the space of one sentence of dialogue.

Produced by the legendary Val Lewton, The Body Snatcher was the first motion picture directed by Robert Wise, who two decades later would receive Academy Awards as both producer and director of a vastly different picture1965s The Sound of Music.

""The Body Snatcher"" is as relevant a motion picture as the 1935 version of ""A Tale of Two Cities""--another film project which lists Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur among the collaborators.  This is superb cinema.",1506556800,,1810,5.256944444444445
