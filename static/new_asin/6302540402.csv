7827175,4,6302540402,"Reportedly Hal Roach's favorite Laurel and Hardy film, ""Beau Hunks"" (1931) pokes fun at ""Morocco"" and ""Beau Geste"" in classic fashion. Originally intended as a two-reeler, Roach doubled the length as the Foreign Legion proceedings ""kept getting funnier and funnier."" Stan and Ollie perform some of their best routines in this underrated effort. Memorable appearances by director James W. Horne, Charles Middleton and the immortal ""Jeanie Weenie.""",1384387200,,446,5.6716417910447765
7827176,5,6302540402,"Another downright hilarious Stan Laurel-Oliver Hardy classic that will keep you laughing so hard you'll barely be able to watch the show.  Ollie, his heart broken by a woman, drags Stan with him to join the French Foreign Legion, where it quickly becomes clear that they weren't meant to be soldiers.  They don't march right, follow orders right, dress right...can't do anything right.  They decide that they want to leave, but their attempt is thwarted by the head guy.  While marching, the boys get separated from their group in a sandstorm.  Eventually arriving at another fort, they use pins to help defeat the enemy and become heroes.
""Traveled all over the world...loved by everyone...and she's mine, all mine.""
""Thank you, Mr. Levity.""",1061078400,5,742,5.049180327868853
