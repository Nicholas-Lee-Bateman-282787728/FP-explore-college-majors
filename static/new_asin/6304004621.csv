7859263,5,6304004621,"I actually first saw this back in the early 90's (wow, seems so long ago) on VHS and loved it. I was in my teens and had dreamed of going to powwows but where I lived at the time, there were none. This video gave me a ticket into a world I would fall in love with. I still have the VHS but wanted to get the DVD for the extras that weren't included on the VHS tape. I loved the interview with Chad KillsCrow but I wish there could have been an interview with Mike Roberts. We know nothing about him. Like what tribe he is from, how old he was when he started dancing and whether or not he had attempted multiple styles of dancing. Overall, I was pleased. Someone mentioned the production quality and how they didn't like it. It never bothered me at all when I saw it back in 90's and still doesn't. Growing up in those days, I was use to it. I think if people see it for the first time in this day and age (keep in mind it was done in like 1989) they would expect a crisp picture and when they don't get that they are disappointed. The movie features both powwow music and some nice classic 80's and early 90's guitar chords. It makes me sick to think we don't have music like this anymore. I will forever miss that!

I would say I would like an update on these two fellas. I wonder if they are still dancing. Would have been nice to have this on the DVD!",1300233600,,1355,4.018518518518518
7859264,5,6304004621,"I really like this DVD because it really educates those that want to learn more about the Native American Indian Culture especially their music, dance and culture. A great look at what it is like to be on the Pow Wow trail.",1236038400,,223,4.333333333333333
7859265,2,6304004621,"I was disappointed in several aspects of this documentary.  First, very poor production values and technical quality.  The recorded voices and the film are out of sync throughout.  Pow Wow drumming and singing are used minimally during film of the dancers.  More often there is a Robert Mirabal-ish New Age soundtrack.  If you enjoy this type of music you may find it less a negative for the film than I did.  If you're collecting a lot of Pow Wow films, you might want to add this one...but find it used or at a sale price.  $16.00 is a high price for a 30-minute film of poor technical quality.  If you are looking for an introduction to the Pow Wow Trail, or to Pow Wow music, I would not recommend this film for you. Overall this views much more like somebody's home movie than like a professionally-produced film, although it evidently was the latter.",1206144000,,856,4.549019607843137
7859266,5,6304004621,Documentary about a young male Pow Wow dancer - excellently done.  Takes you on a informative trip to various Pow Wows and gives you insight into the typical life of a teenager who dances the dances of his Native American Heritage.  Would recommend this as an introduction to Native American Dance.,1143072000,11,298,4.823529411764706
7859267,1,6304004621,"If I could give this a minus, I would!  This is a really, really bad video of two boys (supposedly) who dance at Powwows.  Little is done to reflect on them, or the reasons behind their dancing.  The music is mostly canned, leaving out 80% of the drumming.  The videographer took shots at the sun, he was so bad!
Don't waste your money - buy classic such as Thunderheart, Geronimo, even Wind River.",1051056000,2,398,4.410958904109589
