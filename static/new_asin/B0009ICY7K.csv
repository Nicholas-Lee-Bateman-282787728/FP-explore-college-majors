8061262,3,B0009ICY7K,"An okay ""collection"" of ''THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES'', ''THE LUCY SHOW'',and ''THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW''.The picture quality on the ''TAGS'' episodes looked like they do on TV,same with the ''TBH'' episodes, however ''THE LUCY SHOW'' episodes were very bad. They were full of black and white dots and lines and some of the audio skipped,but I could unsterstand what was being said. There is one bad thing,though:Not a one episode of any show contains the original music,the ''THB'' replacement theme was terrible,there were no words except for when the announcer says ''THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES!'' in a very loud voice,and ''THE LUCY SHOW'' replacement theme is about as close to the original you're gonna get! However,the ''TAGS'' replacement was much better than other companies replacement theme. But don't pay more than $10 and if you don't feel like waiting for them to come from Amazon, you may want to try your local Best Buy or Wal*Mart store,I bought mine at Best Buy.",1148688000,,973,5.0875
8061263,3,B0009ICY7K,"Each of the 3 DVDs is devoted to one show containing 6 episodes.  Each show has it's own storage case for the DVD so if you want to watch say Andy Griffith, you can pull the AG case out separately from the other two.

This collection features early episodes from these three sitcoms.  The Beverly Hillbillies DVD contains 1962 and 1963 episodes so they're all in black and white. Andy Griffith is from 1963 and The Lucy Show is from 1967.

The episodes appear to be complete unlike when you watch classic TV these days where certain scenes are cut to fit in more commercials.  I'm a big Andy Griffith fan and the last scene in these episodes seem fresh since they're the part that's usually the victim in today's commercial laden TV.

I'm not a big fan of Lucy or Beverly so I probably won't buy complete season sets of these series.  However, they're fun shows and it's nice to see them again.  With all the focus on I Love Lucy, it's nice to see one of her lesser known series make it into a DVD collection.

The package says ""Digitally Remastered"" and ""Sound Enhanced"".  I'm not sure what's meant by digitally remastered because these shows look and sound just like they do when you watch reruns today.  The Lucy Show must have been recorded on film because you see all the dots and scratch marks inherent with film.  Plus, you also hear the pops especially coming out of black outs where the commercials used to be.  An ocassional word is omitted where the film was spliced but you can still understand the sentence.

What's the pitfall?  The beginning and ending themes of all these episodes were redone!  I think that's what they mean by ""sound enhanced"" but I certainly don't consider it an enhancement.  The Beverly Hillbillies theme is just music; no words!  The closest remake is on The Lucy Show but what's the point of remaking perfectly good theme songs?  At least the original video is still there however, when you watch classic TV you expect to see everything in original condition and the theme song is what most of us remember from our favorite shows.

Still, it's a nice sampler.  Don't pay more than $15 for it though.  It's a bargain if you can get it for under $10.",1120348800,4,2187,4.511450381679389
