  This is a must have for every SEABEE, and every family member of deceased SEABEES. We too often get questions submitted to our ""OPERATION SEABEES KNOWLEDGE"" online SEABEE community, known as ""The SEABEE grapevine "", from family members asking what a deceased loved one may have done while serving as a SEABEE. It's sad that such things aren't always discussed while the person is alive, and only after a SEABEE passes away are these questions asked of us. At best, we can only hope to roughly approximate what a person may have done and where he may have served.  The only one with all the best first-hand knowledge is the SEABEE himself , so don't hesitate to ask before it's too late !!!!!! One of these DVDs would be a fantastic ice breaker, and a welcome gift for any SEABEE past or present.

  It's my dream to have this DVD replace the old John Wayne film as the public's primary source of info on the SEABEES. John Wayne was a good role model at the time, but the film did not give an accurate account of how the SEABEES were born and only told a small part of the whole story !
  If you don't know who the SEABEES are today , and what they have been doing in every miltary operation around the world for the last sixty five years,...see this episode.",1196553600,15,1350,4.389558232931727
