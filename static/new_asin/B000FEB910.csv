8185988,5,B000FEB910,"I bought this bundle pack for the baby shower of one of my old college roomate's wives. I figured that everyone else would be buying them baby clothes and stuff and I wanted to get something unique. I'm glad I did. My friend was very happy with this nine disk set which is full of  helpful advice for new parents and parents of toddlers. He said it was much easier, and more fun to watch these DVDs that it would have been to read several childcare books. Plus, because the disks are broken down into sections, it is easy for them to replay certain pieces of advice later if they face a similar challenge. All in all this makes a great baby shower gift.",1152835200,,653,4.266129032258065
