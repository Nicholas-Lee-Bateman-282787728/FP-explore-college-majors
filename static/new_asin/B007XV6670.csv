8523028,2,B007XV6670,"This is a poor adaptation of the original.  It has been stretched and padded into an excuse for pretty scenes. It has a good cast but they don't have anything good to do.  When an actor has something strong to do, Naveen Andrew's Jimmy doing Shakespeare, and his Tai Chi scenes, for example, it just doesn't fit.
In the original story,Lisa is killed because she is mistaken for Caroline.  Jimmy blames Caroline for blowing his chance at acting stardom and when enacting his revenge kills the wrong twin and then must go after the other twin. A frightening intense scenario results with some claustrophobic scenes all the more terrifying because they seem ordinary..
Instead we have a jealous lover,a bad twin ,and the typical good twin.
 Caroline lives her twin's life to find out what happened to her, which only turns out to be a reason to put Kim Cattrell in a bikini. This role just doesn't use Cattrell's strengths and really seems to emphasize her weaknesses.  Lisa comes off as a selfish tramp and Caroline simpers.  Cattrell deserves better.
Naveen Andrews fans will enjoy seeing him just out of acting school,and Christopher Lee fans looking for an archaic collectable might want this, otherwise if you want to be entertained, don't bother.",1344038400,,1249,4.867924528301887
