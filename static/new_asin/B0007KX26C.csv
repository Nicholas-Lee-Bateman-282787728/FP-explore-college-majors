The Facts of Life spun-off of the hit sitcom Diff'rent Strokes and the show debuted on Aug 1979 and ended in September of 1988. The first season featured many different cast members such as Jenny O'Hara (Ms. Malone), John Lawler (Headmaster Mr. Bradley), Molly Ringwald (Molly Parker), and many more. After the first season was over the show had a major overhaul to include the cast of Charlotte Rae (Mrs. Garrett), Lisa Whelchel (Blair Warner), Kim Fields (Tootie Ramsey), Mindy Cohn (Natalie Green), and newcomer Nancy Mckeon (Jo Polniaczeck).

The show was centered as four girls growing up in a private all-girl school called Eastland. Mrs. Garrett was their superior, a woman who took charge for the 4 girls. In the 5th Season, after Blair and Jo graduated from Eastland, Mrs. Garrett buys a gourmet food shop called Edna's Edibles and has the four girls move in with her. Two years later after all the girls have graduated from high school except for Tootie, the shop burns to the ground and the girls and Mrs. Garrett decide to open a trendy boutique with misc. gifts. The store was now called Over Our Heads. During the 8th season after many changes Charlotte Rae (Edna Garrett) decided to leave and Cloris Leachman (Beverly Ann) entered the cast as Mrs. Garretts sister Beverly Ann. The show added new cast members throughout seasons 2 to 9 such as Pamela Segall, Mackenzie Astin, Sherrie Krenn (Austin), and George Clooney.

The tape of episodes include:

4. Girl Trouble

*Dope (6/11/80)

*Shoplifting (12/31/80)

*Growing Pains (10/28/81)

*Runaway (2/24/82)

(The Audio/video tape quality of all the volumes are great, I can't believe this isn't a DVD. These are full length episodes, not the episodes that are seen in re-runs.)

*** I was very disapointed Columbia House never released any episodes from Season 5 through 9, which I believe are the best years of the show (Edna's Edibles and Over Our Heads Era).
