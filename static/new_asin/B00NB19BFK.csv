6631401,1,B00NB19BFK,Horrible mistake to watch this! There are no words to describe just how bad this piece of krap movie is...  Nuff said.,1439078400,,118,4.363636363636363
6631402,1,B00NB19BFK,"Boring. And then it even got more boring. Couldn't watch anymore without ripping my eyes out and pushing pencils into my ears. I fell asleep. Which was the only good part of this movie. To be fair, I will add that Bruce Payne was good. Just too bad he didn't have something good to work with.",1438992000,,292,4.232142857142857
6631403,1,B00NB19BFK,I don't know who gave this movies 5 stars.  It's terrible and boring... this coming from a guy who will basically watch any movie.  This is the first movie in some time that I could not watch the entire thing as I could only take 45 minutes of this.  I wish I could get those 45 minutes back.,1438473600,,292,4.0

6631409,1,B00NB19BFK,"This was not good.  Each story bordered on nonsensical, then would abruptly just stop, almost as if in mid-sentence. .",1428105600,6,118,4.9
6631410,5,B00NB19BFK,"TALES OF THE SUPERNATURAL follows ""The Demon"" (banished to Earth by The Devil) as he performs an unholy ritual that releases the souls of the damned from each story segment. This first film (of 3 planned) has six segments linked together. ""The Demon"" is torturing a young Priest and extracting the pain of the souls from each segment. The young Priest takes on the pain of the each tortured soul until his bloody demise. Bruce payne and Jon Campling star in this micro-budget horror.",1408924800,2,483,4.761904761904762

8677092,1,B00NB19BFK,"Six confusing stories linked together by one slightly less confusing story. All the stories were very short, and perhaps that made every one of them feel rushed and poorly executed. I can't help but feel that with proper handling, the stories could have been so much more. The first and last stories were the worst in my opinion -- really not the best way to start and end an anthology. Both stories were confusing as heck, and really just made the movie that much harder to get through. I stuck it out to the very end and I still had absolutely no idea why these stories connect to the main one, expect the demon has to collect six souls (hence the six stories, but the demon never appears in any of the six stories). I read that this is the first of a trilogy. Oh boy, let's hope the demon picks souls with better stories the next time. A must skip.",1464566400,,851,4.291925465838509
