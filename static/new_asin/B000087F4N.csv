This DVD proved to me that there are indeed some artist making serious videos that aren't just made for MTV.  One of the videos is almost entirely comprised of aerial shots over digitally manipulated landscapes...jesus it's like the perfect visual accompaniment to her lush music!  Some are so intense and engaging they left me dazed and euphoric.  If you like Bjork and have a DVD player, you simply must have this.  And if you don't believe me, check out her website and download a few(free).",1058054400,,581,4.77

I already had the original Volumen, so the first 14 videos were not new to me.  I had Volumen on VHS though, so it was nice to have them on DVD, along with the other 7 AMAZING videos.  If you already have the original Volumen, these 7 new videos make the whole thing worth buying.  The ones from the Vespertine era- Hidden Place, Pagan Poetry, and Cocoon- are my favourites.  If you have never seen a Bjrk music video before, then you are in for a real treat.  You don't have the full Bjrk experience unless you have seen the videos.  I love the music of Bjrk, Tori Amos, and Ani DiFranco the same, but out of their music videos, Bjrk's are definitely the best. In case you don't know which songs are on this DVD, here is the list:
1. Human Behaviour
2. Venus As a Boy
3. Play Dead
4. Big Time Sensuality
5. Violently Happy
6. Army Of Me
7. Isobel
8. It's Oh So Quiet
9. Hyperballad
10. Possibly Maybe
11. I Miss You
12. Joga
13. Bachelorette
14. Hunter
15. Alarm Call
16. All is Full of Love
17. Hidden Place
18. Pagan Poetry
19. Cocoon
20. It's In Our Hands
21. Nature Is Ancient",1050019200,25,1085,4.118483412322274
7979456,5,B000087F4N,"There are 21 beautiful videos on this DVD, which is coded Region 0 (Global, anywhere) with PAL format on one side and NTSC on the other... Sound quality is just as amazing as the videos. It surprises me at how difficult this is to find in the US; I purchased mine from Amazon.co.uk ... One word to describe this DVD: AMAZING! Even if you're not already a Bjrk fan, you'll love this DVD for its variety of beautiful, artistic music videos. These are some of the best music videos that I've ever seen.",1045440000,8,499,4.376344086021505
