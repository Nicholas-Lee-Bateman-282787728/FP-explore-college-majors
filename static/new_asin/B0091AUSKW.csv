5240991,5,B0091AUSKW,"Great movie with heart! Thoroughly enjoyed watching ""Sam""-Richard Speight Jr. with the counseling sessions... I could NOT stop laughing!  Well worth ordering!",1346803200,,158,6.181818181818182
5240992,5,B0091AUSKW,I really loved this film and the message behind it .  If you want to see a good family faith based film this is the one to get!,1346630400,3,127,3.5357142857142856
5240993,3,B0091AUSKW,"Not sure what to make of this movie.  To me, I didn't get the message.  I love, love Steve Gray and participate in his services every week online, however, I was a bit disappointed in this movie. I think he tried to bring a message of revival while trying to be comic at the same time.  Unfortunately, these two don't go together.

I don't go to movies or watch movies but I got this simply because of Pastor Steve. it's the only movie DVD that I have.  My kids love this movie and want to watch it back to back to back, all the time, simply because they think it's funny but they haven't learned anything at all. There's really no moral of this story, at least, I didn't get it.  It's just mere entertainment.  I was rather disappointed in the plot....""pastor"" hitting on young lady, people who don't know God trying to lead ""God's"" work.... just a mess.  I guess this was the morale of the story?? Typical Hollywood foolishness... BUT I LOVE WORLD REVIVAL CHURCH!!",1396915200,,966,4.418079096045198
5240994,5,B0091AUSKW,Amazing family movie. Great story. My family and I we're blow away by the great message that was in this movie .,1391731200,,112,4.136363636363637
5240995,5,B0091AUSKW,"This is a great movie for people of all ages, tons of sarcasm, but also great message. This movie also challenges the religious system just enough to make a point. The acting is not bad, graphics are not the best, but it is forgivable because the storyline makes up for it. This is different than most Christian films, it doesnt push the come to Jesus message too much. The audience is actually to church goers and the unchurched. It is nice to see a film that speaks to the church goers rather than speaking at sinners. The message was carefully crafted and specifically targeted. Great film, I've loved it so much that I've purchased multiple copies for gifts for friends.",1387843200,,674,4.625

5241007,5,B0091AUSKW,"Extremely Funny, causes you to rethink about religion and what matters most in the pursuit for God. If you are a Christian, you need to watch this to get a deeper insight of what christianity is all about. If you are not a Christian, you need to watch this to have a good laugh about religion and to know the purpose of God for you.",1378771200,,332,4.123076923076923
5241008,5,B0091AUSKW,I loved this movie because it was a realistic portrayal of how people perceive Christians in an honest way where everyone is not perfect. It's refreshing to see people struggle and work out their issues with God. Most mainstream churches turn a blind eye to realism for goody goody approaches that are unbelievable. Way to go for not making the theology so complicated that the average non church goer would be lost. Great job getting down where we live. Thumbs up!,1378771200,,465,4.753086419753086

5241018,5,B0091AUSKW,"Finally a film that will get the attention of both the Christian and non-Christian crowds! Absolutely hilarious and a film that the entire family can watch and laugh with. I highly recommend this movie if you are tired of the ""family"" films or even the Tyler Perry films. I was surprised by the quality of this film as well as the overall meat and depth the film contained. It will definitely satisfy a family night for your home!",1378771200,,430,4.5256410256410255

5241024,4,B0091AUSKW,"As family comedies and Christian movies go this is golden. Most family movies have horrible acting, unrealistic story lines, and terrible humor. This movie is a bit hokey at times, but it is an excellent family film. Parents you can leave the room while they watch the movie, I can't even do that with most Disney and ion specials. Worth the money because it has decent acting, some pretty funny parts, and an ok story line. Anyone who says otherwise was expecting a $100 million dollar movie when they bought it, which the kids probably couldn't watch alone.",1378771200,,559,4.714285714285714

5241035,1,B0091AUSKW,"I was led to believe that this movie was consistent the Christian values! It is not. For that reason, I wish I could give it negative stars.

The movie starts out okay.  It was funny, quirky, a little sarcastic...

I had heard that it was a pastor who had made this movie. So I was horrified when, towards the end of the movie, there was a transvestite scene. To make it worse, the character said that God told him to dress like a woman and seduce a certain man.

This is not a Christian movie or good Christian entertainment!",1369440000,10,526,4.282828282828283

5241043,1,B0091AUSKW,I purchased this movie based on the reviews and I have been duped. This movie is not good at all. Do not waste your money. I will no longer purchase from Amazon soley based on the reviews. Buyer beware!,1356912000,5,202,4.205128205128205
5241044,3,B0091AUSKW,"I'm with Peter McNeely... something does not seem legitimate. 17 out of 21 reviews are 5 star and 3 of the others are 4 star... for a movie I have never heard of before (and I read a lot about Christian movies because I am a youth leader looking for good ones.) The reviewers can not find anything negative to say about the movie. Same on IMDB where all 6 viewer reviews are glowing... either 9 or 10 out of 10. But IMDB, which has ways of determining if a film's rating is being unethically bolstered by friends/family gives the film an overall rating from 82 viewers of 3.4/10. Odd, isn't it?

Something does not add up. To write this review I had to give ""3 Blind Saints""  a rating so I rated it an indeterminate ""3"". But I think I will save my money and look for more promising fare.

Not only does it discuss true faith in a fun way, it recognizes the hypocrisy that has come into the church and shows how to change.

Scriptwriter Gray really did a masterful job with this family-friendly flick. Hopefully, Gray will continue to exercise his talent in this scriptwriting arena.

Plus they treated the volunteers that helped on this movie like crap, a lot of them gave there time and lots of hours and while in the process they refused to provide some of these volunteers with food and drinks just for helping. They conned people into giving money to help film and while promising returns of money was a lie. Plus helping the volunteers out was not going to help fill Steve Grays pockets! The movie was a flop lol",1425340800,3,476,4.420454545454546

8533961,3,B0091AUSKW,"I read the reviews on Amazon, then purchased the digital download and watched it. I agree with some of the negative comments as well as some of the positive. On the negative side, the movie seems disjointed, or choppy, like a bunch of scenes were cut and pasted back to back, at least relative to the level of normal Hollywood production. Seeing as how these were rookie producers/directors, I will give them a pass on that. It wasn't terrible....just noticeable.

Also, I'm not sure of the overall theme of the movie. If I had to describe it, I would say it was a sarcastic parody of how Christian religion functions. Mostly, the movie's writer took pot-shots at religion, like a hunter who hinds behind a duck blind and every so often pops up, takes a few shots, then returns to hiding behind the blind. Even though many of those pot-shots could be, and probably are, valid takes on religion, it didn't always seem to flow withing the context of a smooth-running movie...i.e. the pot-shots seemed a little forced.

Positive...I really thought the principle actors did a great job of acting. There were some genuinely funny moments, and the facial expressions and nuances of Richard Speight, Jr. were especially entertaining. And while I made somewhat negative comments about the pot-shots above, I couldn't help but chuckle at some of them because they did seem to ring true.

Also, the second-tier actors (extras?) did a pretty good job of doing their parts without drawing attention to the fact that some of them were amateurs. Maybe we could credit the director with a job well done on that account.

Production quality wasn't too bad, both audio and video seemed satisfactory.

Overall, a pretty good movie, if you don't compare it to top-flight Hollywood fare. I will be interested to see what kind of adjustments this production company makes on their next movie.",1413936000,,1871,4.852664576802508
8533962,3,B0091AUSKW,I guess I expected something a little less corny and predictable.  It didn't go over well with about half the congregation.,1398124800,,123,4.857142857142857
