At the same time it's good to fall asleep to and the background music is varied and a blend of interesting 70s disco without voices.",1498521600,,183,4.411764705882353
8350811,2,B0024OJ05G,"The picture on jacket is what you see the whole time, so that is your view. Too far to enjoy seeing the water. It was hard to relax because who ever made this, never reviewed their work. If they had, they would have heard the LOUD non-ending sound of wind over-whelming the microphone. Instead of waves and birds it was a constant white noise like a vacuum cleaner in the next room. About half way thru, you hear a guy come up and say something like ""you guys making a movie?"" or ""is this one of those movies?"" and another male voice says ""yes"". First guy said ""that's cool"" or something. Then when it gets darker, it's suddenly light again. They just rewound what they already recorded and hit ""repeat"". Waste of money.",1329609600,3,720,4.421052631578948
