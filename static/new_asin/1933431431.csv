7801746,4,1933431431,"This set of DVDs was very informative.  It is for the Christian film maker exclusively, which is why I liked it so much.  You get information on what types of films should be produced and why.  As well as information on what not to produce and why.  Also some instruction in using very expensive cameras.
Good info too about copyright laws, etc.
