7922127,4,B00004STIW,"This video is quite good and entertaining although the narration by James Woods will not win any awards. The 60 minute program addresses the issue of cheating in modern casinos. The casino scams exposed in this video are those committed by outside cheats who work for themselves. Although all the cheating techniques are valid (except a bit outdated) I wish that it told more about the understructure of certain scams.
I almost wish that this video were more controversial. It would have been interesting to expose some of the other facts about casino cheating. Many times cheats bribe casino personnel (or even seek employment in casinos) in order to execute certain scams. Other times cheats are hired my casinos' upper management to get some tax-free cold hard cash straight into their pockets. These facts were not mentioned.
All in all the video is informative and gives a good overview of the issue of outside cheating in casinos.",1016668800,,936,4.968152866242038
7922128,4,B00004STIW,"American ""edutainment"" is a poor medium indeed. Producers often make great efforts to make their subjects seem more dramatic or more  interesting by adding corny music or passe dialog. Cheating Las Vegas  suffers a little from this but, thankfully the subject matter shines  through with the help of some fascinating real life CCTV footage and the  remarkable experiences related by it's interviewees. If you have ever been  into a Casino, this may open your eyes on some accounts but, even if you've  never gambled, this tape is worth a spin. Fascinating stuff.",967852800,,562,5.054347826086956
