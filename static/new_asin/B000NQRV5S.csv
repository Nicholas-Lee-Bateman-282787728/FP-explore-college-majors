This one has some good, informative episodes...as they all do ;)  Other reviewers had mentioned music/songs being absent but we really didn't think it took away from the overall pleasure rating...  We thought it was worth the purchase.",1332979200,,406,5.7

2778322,5,B000NQRV5S,"My son absolutely adores Snook, and the rest of his crew. I'm actually kind of fond of the big sleepy sloth myself. Great music, awesome lessons, and an original cast, what more could a parent or child hope for. I especially love the nature themed morals and lessons taught through this show. I'm not sure if this show still airs on PBS, we haven't seen it in a while, but I made sure to snag all of the DVD's.",1224720000,,410,4.2025316455696204

8180911,3,B000NQRV5S,"i somewhat like how they teach kids that they need to care for the trees and all but theres this one episode i dislike so much.
this monkey ,winslows(?) sister is making a garden and disses everyone off. the way she approaches her friends is so rude and not appropriate for kids. and its like that through out the whole episode it is so annoying!",1416096000,,346,4.338461538461538
8180912,5,B000NQRV5S,Personally these are hands down the best shows on pbs... I remember watching these with my oldest son now eight when he was a tiny baby.. The music and characters drew all of us so much I memorized that birthday song for his first birthday and to this day still sing it him. Broke our hearts when they cancelled it. Now we can show his 14 mo old brother and he's getting into then add much as the rest of the family . Truly a great find and if you do buy it!! Reason so many of same.. we bought all of them lol,1393977600,2,510,3.9134615384615383
8180913,5,B000NQRV5S,My kids use to watch it on channel 13 (PBS). So i bought this for them and they were very happy. They have been watching it.,1391385600,3,124,3.8076923076923075
8180914,5,B000NQRV5S,"Ok, laugh if you want, but I bought this for my parrot. A few years ago, PBS used to play this tv series twice a day and my parrot would go crazy and sing and dance to the theme song and then to the songs inside the show. The only other time he's done that is with the Curious George theme song. So when it was yanked off the air (why?!) I searched everywhere - even its own website doesn't sell the dvds! I was thrilled when I found this collection on Amazon - so is my parrot! But I have to admit, I quite like it myself as an adult. On in the background for the parrot while I work, I find the songs soothing and the messages are peaceful and serene. Heaven knows why it was stopped - it sure beats the shows they're playing now (which my parrot doesn't care for. lol)",1390435200,3,771,3.9806451612903224
8180915,5,B000NQRV5S,"The music that accompanies the show is great, full of catchy, memorable tunes.  All of the shows teach valuable lessons for pre school children.",1356739200,3,144,5.0
