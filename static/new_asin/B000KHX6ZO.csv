2691287,5,B000KHX6ZO,"This DVD look great, go get it, enjoy it, i will... Also, A LOT is 2 seperate words...you'll see many typos in previous reviews, that should tell you about the reviews, do not listen this dvd will be great..",1167696000,,207,4.333333333333333
2691288,1,B000KHX6ZO,"I'm not going to get into the whole debate about whether or not it was a good idea to relaunch ECW as a brand extension of WWE. It is what it is, another form of WWE ""sports entertainment"". What I want to address here is the fact that most ECW fans (myself included) who have been fans from the beginning and traded vhs tapes and bought the bootleg tv shows from RF Video back in mid 90s, want to see the original ECW on DVD, not this. Like it or not, WWE owns the entire ECW tape library. I thought the ""Rise + Fall of ECW"" and ""Bloodsport"" were great DVD releases. This is what all of us want to see, the classic footage from ECW (and trust me, there's a lot of it!), not a collection of tv matches from the ECW relaunch. To me, it's a mistake to mix the two on this release. This is a 2 disc set with classic ECW matches on Disc One and the new ECW dominating Disc Two. I am excited that my favorite Sabu vs Taz match is FINALLY getting released on DVD and that's the FTW ECW World Title Unification match from Living Dangerously. Also making it's debut is a brutal weapons cage match between the Eliminators and the Gangstas, Sandman vs Cactus Jack in a barbed wire match, Tommy Dreamer vs Brian Lee in one of their gimmick matches and a few more classics that have already been released on DVD. It's worth picking up for the classics, but I can do without the new ECW matches from the Sci-Fi tv show. Sure, they'll put the violent match between Flair and the Big Show on this disc (which is worth seeing if you missed it on tv), the RVD vs Sabu ladder match and probably RVD vs Hardcore Holly (where Holly cut his back deep and hardway), but the problem is that this isn't ECW. It has the look and feel of Raw most of the time and you can't escape the fact that this truly is WWE. So, after seeing the WWE's 2007 list of DVD releases, I was very disappointed to find this on the list instead of a ""Bloodsport Vol. 2"" or the start of a History of ECW release. And with no best of ECW release planned for 2007 and no interest in the current ECW by WWE (there are rumors that Vince will either fold ECW or change it to ""WWE Extreme"") it looks like we may not see anymore classic ECW footage available on DVD again. I have all of the out of print Pioneer DVD releases, and they're great, but there is SO MUCH MORE that has yet to see the light of day on DVD that I and a lot of other ECW fans (and wrestling fans in general) would love to get our hands on. The original Funk vs. Sabu matches, the Night the Line was Crossed 3-way dance, Sabu vs. the Tazmaniac, Shane Douglas vs. 2 Cold Scorpio (ECW TV Title - one of the best ECW matches ever!), the complete series of tag matches between RVD + Sabu vs. The Eliminators... I could go on, but you get the idea. I want to see classic ECW, not this relaunch mess. I'm so passionate about it, that I've already written WWE and have asked them to release more classic ECW matches on DVD. If you want to do the same, here's the address...

If enough people voiced their opinion about wanting to see more matches from the original ECW make their way to DVD, the WWE would listen. As for this release, like I said, it may have a few decent WWE style matches on it, but by no means is this ECW!",1167091200,13,3331,4.138888888888889
2691289,1,B000KHX6ZO,"The WWE ECW is pure garbage. Vince McMahon cares nothing about the legacy of ECW. Vince McMahon is a moron. He would rather spend 20 minutes of air time having grown men kiss his rear end (literally) on live television than let Paul Heymen run ECW the way it should have been run.

ECW is is dead now, please do not buy this DVD. Purchase TNA DVD's instead.

2691291,4,B000KHX6ZO,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

This was the third match anthology of Extreme Championship Wresting released with a special twist in that not only does this set showcase the original ECW but also matches from the relaunch under the WWE banner.  Joey Styles & Tazz host this set with Aeral giving us a tarot card reading to start the show while we are also treated throughout the set to various ECW history highlights from the original promotion (the same ones shown during One Night Stand 2005), the One Night Stand PPV's & the ""WWE vs. ECW: Head To Head"" TV special along with Extreme Vignettes on various members of the ECW roster from the originals (Sandman, Sabu, Balls Mahoney) to the ""new breed"" (C.M. Punk, Kevin Thorn, Kelly Kelly, Big Show).

Matches Include:
ECW Champion Sandman vs. Cactus Jack - Cactus Jack had his entire forearm & hand wrapped in barbed wire while Sandman had a singapore cane in his hand & Woman with an extra cane at ringside as Sandman started out with cane shots to Cactus' head & even going aerial leaping over the top rope to deliver a cane shot but Cactus was able to recover with a single arm DDT along with using the cane himself & delivering a chairshot.  Sandman was able to use Cactus' barbed wire against him by blocking a barbed wire punch with a chair & caning that arm then turned his focus to his head with a DDT & piledriver on a chair causing Cactus to bleed while also trying to fight fire with fire using barbed wire himself but Cactus Jack made a comeback using a chair for his trademark elbow off the apron, second rope legdrop with Sandman's face covered with a chair, and punches with the barbed wire hand until Sandman was bleeding but the biggest impact would come from someone who had a personal agenda against both men.  I'll be honest in that I didn't like the Sandman/Cactus Jack series of matches as they came off as sloppy brawls but this was their best encounter from that series.
Hardcore Heaven '95
[ECW: Hardcore History]

Steel Cage/Weapons Match: Tag Team Champions Gangstas vs. Eliminators - This match was a normal steel cage match but had the additional twist of four executioners at ringside to hand in a weapon whenever one of the participants called for it & match had a more serious tone than any of the previous matches between both teams as Gangstas walked to the ring opposed to running to the ring but both teams started brawling outside of the cage into the crowding using whatever they could to beat on each other from the title belts to chair to the guardrail before making their way back around the ring with Saturn diving off the top of the cage onto everyone.  The fight continued in the ring with everyone at one point being tossed into the cage & bleeding with various weapons used including a fork, trash can, cookie sheet, and keyboard while Saturn kept going aerial off the cage with multiple dives before he was eventually caught one time resulting in a dangerous fall that had a really bad landing.  This was your typical Gangstas weaponsfest brawl with without a doubt the highlight reel being Saturn's multiple dives off the top of the cage along with the shock of who one of the executioners was unmasked to be.
Natural Born Killaz '96
[ECW: Hardcore History]

Scaffold Match: Tommy Dreamer vs. Brian Lee - The rules for a scaffold match are that the first man to throw his opponent off the scaffold to the floor wins but this match had a special twist in that the ring was filled with tables for the loser to fall through on the way down.  This started off with a bang with Dreamer bouncing a trash can off Lee's head & putting it through the wall as both men brawled throughout the crowd using whatever they could such as the candy machine, beer cooler, chairs & tables while taking some hard hits like being dropped crotch first on the guardrail & a powerslam on the concrete before both men eventually made their way to the scaffold where they were still beating the hell out of each other with either a DDT or choking with the electrical wiring.  Normally scaffold matches are very limited with both opponents not having much room on it to fight while the crowd is really just waiting for someone to fall off but that wasn't the case here as a majority of the match was fought throughout the entire arena before making their way to the top making this standout above other scaffold matches.
Alternative commentary by Tommy Dreamer & Johnathan Coachman talked about the ECW bingo hall, the differences between WWE & ECW, the story behind who built the scaffold, and how this was a historic night.
High Incident '96
[ECW: Hardcore History]

Stairway To Hell Match: Sandman vs. Sabu - For those who have never seen a Stairway To Hell Match, it's ECW's version of a ladder match with the twist being that you climb up the ladder to get a weapon to be used during the match which in this case was barbed wire.  Sabu started off throwing the ladder into Sandman's face repeatably while resorting to his hard daredevil offense such as the springboard legdrop sandwiching Sandman's head between the chair & ladder, atomic arabian facebuster onto the ladder, and a triple jump dive into the front row.  They brawled in the crowd eventually making their way back to the ring with Sandman's offense consisting of suplexing the ladder onto Sabu in the front row & a legdrop through a table but unfortunately was on the receiving end of a crash & burn off the ladder to the outside followed by Sabu missing an offensive move that caused his jaw to hit the guardrail & start bleeding from the mouth only for him to tape it up as both men continued to get more violent with their weapons of choice from using scissors to stab in the head or the barbed wire itself.  This was a violent brawl more than anything else as both men took some very hard hits & falls.
House Party '98
[ECW: Path Of Destruction]

Street Fight Match: Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Spike Dudley vs. Dudley Boyz - This started off with both teams wrestling & taking some big moves early from D-Von taking a reverse neckbreaker while hanging off the top rope to Spike being tossed & thrown around like a rag doll before the match broke out in an all out brawl on the outside & into the crowd before making it back to the ring where various weapons were being used such as a dive off a ladder in the ring to the outside & later a senton off the ropes onto their opponent laying on the ladder, four way trees of woe dropkicks with chairs, one tossed out of the ring through a table, one guy on the receiving end of a killer chairshot, and a DDT onto a ladder.  This was nothing more than a weapons filled brawl that not only got physical with all six men but anyone else associated with them both during & after the match.
Heatwave '98

Falls Count Anywhere/Death Match: ECW Champion Taz vs. FTW Champion Sabu - Sabu came into this match with a taped up broken jaw due to one hell of a lariat by Taz in a match in an earlier match while Taz earlier in the night made it clear that he was going to target that injury which he did right away with grounded amateur wrestling followed by crossfaces across the jaw & a boot directly to the jaw before both men used a chair in various ways against each other such as launching it at one's head & chairshots.  They took the brawl to the outside both in the crowd & to the ramp with Taz launching Sabu off the ramp into the crowd on top of a fan followed by a release belly to belly over the top rope that took out the camera feed for a few seconds & dropping Sabu jaw first on the guardrail causing his mouth to bleed as Bill Alfonzo to try to get involve only to just make Taz even more mad.  Both men traded momentum such as Sabu coming off the top rope onto Taz on a table laying on top of the guardrails, Taz's various Tazplexes including one off the top rope & another through a table, Sabu's triple jump moonsault & legdrop, and Bill Alfonzo wanting to throw the towel in for Sabu.  While their most well known match is from Barely Legal, I personally felt like this was their best televised match against each other as they did more of a mixture of wrestling & brawling while taking advantage of their environment both in & outside of the ring.
Alternative commentary with Joey Styles & Tazz talked about how Taz produced his own entrance while Styles did the graphics for Taz different than any other ECW talent, the history of the FTW Championship, the real life feud between Taz & Sabu, where the name ""Tazplex"" came from, and why Taz eventually went to WWE.
Living Dangerously '98

ECW Champion Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome - This was the rematch from the week earlier with this time Tanaka coming in as the ECW Champion & Awesome looking for revenge as he charged Tanaka & was more aggressive than usual with a suicide dive over the top rope with Tanaka coming back with a top rope crossbody before Awesome topped that with a springboard splash.  A chair came into play with both men using it in various ways like a running chair to the head, various unprotected chairshots, coming off the top rope with it, having it kicked back into his face, a tornado DDT onto it, and top rope flying chair onto another one on top of his opponent's face while both continued to deliver impactful punishment like a release german suplex, various powerbombs, top rope moves like a DDT & splash, and even putting another through a table.  This didn't go as long as their more high profile matches but it was still the same match that you expect from these two against each other in that it was very intense & high impact from start to finish.
""ECW on TNN"" Dec. '99

Tables & Ladders & Chairs & Canes Match: ECW Champion Steve Corino vs. Sandman vs. Justin Credible - Corino was the ECW Champion going into this match but Sandman had physical possession of the title since the previous PPV while Credible still had unfinished business with both men leading to this match here.  The ladder came into play early & throughout in the match being used as a weapon such as one man launching it into another, one ladder being rode down upon another ladder, a ladder setup in the corner with a body tossed into it, a bulldog onto the ladder, the ladder being chairshotted into another man's crotch, the classic Terry Funk helicopter ladder spin, a suplex onto the ladder, and the ladder taking such a beating that it couldn't take anymore.  All three men continued to fight each other including some unlikely alliances formed along with the other weapons coming into play such as each man being caned at some point, going out of the ring through a table on more than one occasion, and the managers at ringside getting involved as well including a ""coochie-conrana.""  This wasn't a ladder match filled with memorable ""highlight reel"" moments more than just a very physical fight with the weapons being brought into play for more impact.
Guilty As Charged '01

Tommy Dreamer & Sandman vs. Dudley Boyz - It should be noted that the Sandman's entrance on the original PPV broadcast was ""Enter Sandman"" but that's been dubbed over with generic music on this release & we got a bunch of appearances from many fellow ECW alumni resulting in ""a brawl before THE brawl"" with Joey Styles hitting the line of the night in response to one chairshot that was delivered.  It didn't take long for both teams to start assaulting each other with weapons from a cookie sheet to the cheesegrader causing blood to floor & Bubba wearing it as war paint before Dreamer payed homage to Terry Funk with his classic ladder airplane spin while Sandman also was able to use the ladder against Devon on more than one occasion with Bubba eventually able to use the ladder to his advantage with a frog splash onto it.  Things got even more chaotic when other people wanted to ""make an impact"" at the expense of both teams leading to a ""catfight"" & reunion that ECW fans have been waiting 7 years for only to be eventually topped by another family reunion that involved a road sign, singapore cane, and the flaming table.  To steal a line from the original ECW...this is ""EXTREME"".
One Night Stand '05

Extreme Rules Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Rey Mysterio - Both men knew each other well from being former tag team champions in the past that they both showed mutual respect after having a stalemate due to each man having equal quickness against each other before RVD showed his superior strength with a body press & backflip splash only for Mysterio to capitalize on a missed maneuver diving onto RVD in the front row as both men continued to trade momentum throughout the match such as RVD's with his guillotine apron legdrop & skateboard dropkick in the corner with a chair while Mysterio did a top rope bulldog onto the chair only to miss the springboard legdrop onto the chair.  This was definitely one of the highlight matches during Mysterio's run as World Champion while RVD seemed back at home & more motivated than usual with the relaxed rules.
""WWE vs. ECW: Head To Head"" June '06

Extreme Rules Match: World Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Sabu - You had a clue where this match was going with both men had a dueling chairs battle early as they were able to use the chair in ways such as a springboard for a leg lariat & frankensteiner, drop toe hold into it, and just having it launched straight at the head before both men went aerial with moves like a top rope moonsault, second rop legdrop, springboard leg lariat, triple jump moonsault, Sabu's arabian facebuster with a chair & Mysterio's seated senton through a table while both men showing why it's called ""high risk"" as they didn't always connect with their aerial offense & one attempted maneuver ended up sending both men through a table on the outside.  This was built up as a dream match between both men highly known for their high risk aerial offensive which they did showcase here while implementing the elements of the chairs & tables as well with the only real negative here being the finish.
One Night Stand '06

Extreme Rules Match: Tommy Dreamer, Terry Funk, Beulah vs. Edge, Mick Foley, Lita - It was during this time that Foley had aligned himself with Edge & Lita to the point where they resurrected the retired Hardcore Championship & declared themselves co-champions but this originally scheduled tag match was turned into a six ""person"" tag when Beulah challenged Lita after she kept getting involved in the prior weeks while Foley came into the match with a black eye thanks to Funk & did a funny pre-match promo referring to a period in the history ECW that all the fans truly hated. All four men started brawling both in the ring & on the floor with various weapons coming into play such as a cookie sheet, Dreamer doing a baseball sliding a trash can into Foley & Dreamer hip tossed onto a ladder by Edge before Funk did his classic airplane spin with the ladder before Foley pulled out a barbed wire board that came into effect as everyone took a hit into this board at one point. Edge & Foley got very violent using the divide & conquer strategy using the barbed wire to have Funk bleeding from the eye, Dreamer taking ""Barbie"" between the legs, and even Beulah getting a taste of Mr. Socko but they fought back resulting in Foley being on fire with both him & Funk falling into the barbed wire board, Dreamer using the a barbed wire crossface, the traditional ECW ""catfight"" before things ended in a pin attempt that was so sleazy that even the referee went ""what the hell are you doing?"" This match was the EXTREME violence you would expect from a show with the letters ""ECW"" attached to it.
One Night Stand '06
[Mick Foley's Greatest Hits & Misses: Hardcore Edition; Edge: Decade Of Decadence]

Extreme Rules Match: ECW Champion Rob Van Dam vs. Big Show - After RVD lost his WWE Championship the previous night on RAW, he accepted Big Show's challenge against the wishes of Paul Heyman. They started out in the ring but eventually worked through the crowd at ringside with Show only beating down RVD including one moment where he caught RVD coming off the top rope & just easily tossed him out. RVD was able to gain some momentum & used the ""Extreme Rules"" to his advantage by countering Show's attempt to use the steel steps causing Show's head to bounce off them. However Paul Heyman would be the determining factor in this match the same way he was weeks earlier at the One Night Stand PPV except in this case, RVD's title reign when ""Up In Smoke"" as he lost the title to the Big Show in what was dubbed ""The South Philly Screwjob.""
""ECW on Sci-Fi"" July '06
[Big Show: A Giant's World]

Extreme Rules Match: ECW Champion Big Show vs. Ric Flair - This was not only Ric Flair's first ever ECW Championship match but the first time that he's appeared in any version of ECW.  Flair started off with chops only for Show to keep shoving him off & overpower him with moves like the high press slam & headbutts to the head that busted Flair's open followed by chops in the corner & a powerslam as Flair's attempts at offense had no effects to the point where he had to take ""extreme"" measures such as going low & using hardcore weapons such as barbed wire & trash can & chair only for Show to get extremely mad after taking a hard fall & come back with one big move after another that resulted in Flair being tossed down in a way that he's never been before.  The appeal of this match was to see a legend like Flair put into a type of environment that he's never been in throughout his career & looking at the match from that perspective, it was a good encounter.
""ECW on Sci-Fi"" July '06

Ladder Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Sabu - This was to determine the number one contender for the ECW Title match at SummerSlam that with both men starting out as a regular match with Sabu connecting with punches while trying to avoid RVD springboard sidekick but still got hit in the leg with RVD taking some high risk early on such as trying to leap from the top rope & grab the hanging contract in mid-air allowing Sabu to hit back to back offense from a springboard position.  The ladder came into play at various points throughout the match to either make a move more impactful or as a weapon such as a top rope dive not only onto the ladder but the opponent underneath it, giving the ladder a monkeyflip, RVD attempting rolling thunder only for Sabu to move & him land on the ladder while later Sabu missed the arabian facebuster onto the ladder before someone else who had an interest in this match made his presence known against both men.  I've always said that RVD & Sabu never had a bad match against each other but this one wasn't picture perfect pretty as both men took some risky moves involving the ladder that didn't pay off but still a nice match.
""ECW on Sci-Fi"" Aug. '06

Extreme Rules Match: Rob Van Dam & Sabu vs. Test & Mike Knox - Knox & Test both tried to keep both men down with strikes & clotheslines before RVD was able to mount momentum with a big jumping spin kick that ended up taking himself over the top rope while Sabu joined in with dual leg lariats while Sabu executed a springboard crossbody that sent everyone off the apron through a table but Test was able to use Sabu's own momentum against him by tripping him into a chair face first only for RVD to use the chair to skateboard it into the corner on Test along with Sabu's camel clutch with RVD dropkicking the chair into his opponents face & Sabu launching a chair at both Test & Knox followed by double top rope legdrops on Test & Knox through a table.  This was a fun TV match.
""ECW on Sci-Fi"" Sept. '06

Extreme Rules Match: Rob Van Dam vs. Hardcore Holly - This started off in the ring but quickly made it's way to the floor as RVD took advantage of his surroundings with a spinning legdrop on the barricade but Holly was able to send RVD into the steps & ringpost face first while focusing on his neck with a rope choke & chinlock before delivering a suplex off the apron that not only took both men through a table but had Holly's back sliced open but continued to fight dropping RVD across the chair throat first & top rope legdrop on a chair across RVD's face while later delivering a powerbomb onto a chair but RVD focused on Holly's bleeding back using a chair in various ways like suplexing him onto it, skateboarding the chair in the corner, and a rolling thunder on the chair.  This match told a good story about both men focusing on a certain body part but this was more about the toughness of Hardcore Holly for having a very deep bloody gash across his back yet still continuing the match & not letting up the whole time so you have to give him respect for being very tough regardless about how you feel about him personally.
""ECW on Sci-Fi"" Sept. '06

This set was very different than the previous ECW sets as I felt like it came off rushed.  While I didn't have a problem with the matches they selected based off quality, they picked out matches that reflected only hardcore violence that ECW was stereotyped with unlike the previous (and future) sets which showcased more of a diversity while clearly reusing a lot of material from the One Night Stand PPV DVD's which I pointed out in the beginning.  A bunch of previous reviews went off in rants & or were clearly biased against the second disc strictly because it's WWE's ECW & not the original promotion but that's irrelevant when watching the match itself from bell to bell because all that matters is the quality of the performance and most of the matches on here were good quality performances with the only thing that I felt hurt it was that too many matches on this disc were from the previous One Night Stand events instead of using some other matches that were left off such as Dreamer/Sandman vs. Knox/Test from the Hammerstein Ballroom, RVD vs. Kurt Angle, and RVD vs. Test in what many considered to be one of the best matches in Test's entire career.  In the end, this is an ECW set that I would recommend but only for those who liked the bloody hardcore violence that ECW was known for.",1166140800,13,22084,4.483573917371827

There's a reason I'll never watch a transformers movie and that reason is I don't like seeing memories of my youth pissed on. The inclusion of Mike Knox and Test and passing them off as being somehow on par with what we saw from ECW in the 90's pisses on my memories.

ECW is New Jack using knives and nail guns in matches. ECW is the Sandman getting dead drunk and smoking 3-5 cigarettes on the way to the ring and then bleeding all over the arena. ECW is the crowd getting so involved that they throw about 500 folding metal chairs and bury the ring. ECW is Sabu jumping off of anything and everything in an attempt to kill both his opponent and himself. ECW is Shane Douglas, Mick Foley, Terry Funk, Steve Austin, the Dudley Boyz, Tommy Dreamer and a lot of other people Vince McMahon seemingly never heard of wresting for a mad scientist named Paul Heyman for a fraction of what the big 2 companies were paying and they poured their heart, blood, sweat, snot and tears into it.

i agree with this COMPLETELY!! someone else who is loyal to the OLD SCHOOL ECW!!! i bought this dvd, and yeah disc 1 is great! the Dudleyz vs dreamer and Sandman on disc 2 was just AWESOME! that whole 2005 ONS was SUPER! especially the end when the ECW faithfuls were beating the crap out of the WWE wussies!!! i will watch disc 1 FOREVER!!! disc 2 i will use to wipe my butt! that's what i think of McMahon! and that is why i only give it 4 stars",1214956800,,1007,4.025
2691304,5,B000KHX6ZO,"I have the majority of the old ECW dvd's, so there was nothing new for me on disc 1. To me, disc 2 was where it got good. Mysterio v. Sabu, Awesome v. Tanaka, Flair in an ECW match, Hardcore Holly's disgusting tear in his lower back, Funk and Dreamer and Beulah and Foley and Edge and Lita, etc. If you've never seen old ECW, it makes this dvd a no brainer.",1198800000,,357,3.9722222222222223
2691305,4,B000KHX6ZO,"I won't do my usual match by match review because others have already adequetely done it. I will say that Disc 1 is the only reason to get this release because it has the classic ECW.

Disk 2 is only worth a look for the following matches:

The Dudley Boyz Vs. Tommy Dreamer & The Sandman (ECW One Night Stand 2005)

Rob Van Damn Vs. Rey Mysterio (ECW Vs. WWE)

Rey Mysterio Vs. Sabu (ECW One Night Stand 2006)

Tommy Dreamer, Terry Funk & Beulah Vs. Edge, Lita & Mick Foley (ECW One Night Stand 2006)

The rest of the matches from the recent ECW are pretty much weak though I did find some entertainment in Sabu VS. RVD in a ladder match, Flair Vs. The Big Show and RVD Vs. Hardcore Holly where Holly suffered that horrid gash in his upper back!

Beyond that, Disc 2 isn't worth much. I'd buy this one for Disc 1. If you want a good ECW package from WWE, I'd recommend ECW Bloodsport.",1181692800,,885,4.170588235294118
2691306,4,B000KHX6ZO,"Some of the reviewers are totally ridiculous. Its true I don't like what WWE is doing with ECW now. Yes I know they put this DVD out to make some money. This is still a fairly good DVD and its worth it to get it.

I won't rate every match, like I usually do. The first DVD is great, it has many matches that are B, or B+ matches. You even get a few A matches. The Sabu vs Sandman match is a classic. Sabu vs Tazz another A match. The street fight from Heatwave 98, goes to show why it was one of the best PPV's ever. Grade A-

The 2nd disc isn't nearly as good. A few of the matches really aren't hardcore. Most of them are average C matches that are ok at best. Some of the matches aren't too bad such as the sabu vs RVD. Grade C+

Overall its worth it too see the matches. Its 3 hours long and fairly enjoyable.",1181260800,,813,3.856287425149701

Look how many talented wreslers came from ECW: Beniot, Mysterio, RVD, Sabu, Sandman, Tanaka, Awesome, Raven, the list goes on and on. There feuds were far better then anything in WCW or WWE every done. Tanaka vs Awesome, Sabu vs RVD, Jerry Lynn VS RVD are prime examples of this. Im sick of WWE releasing Best of ECW, espeically since they have ruined the company. They should release best of Sandman or Sabu.

2691309,1,B000KHX6ZO,"This is with out a doubt the worst ECW DVD released. If it was released as a single disk (disk # 1 not # 2) I'd still only give it 3 stars. The quality of the matches are great, classic ECW but Vinny being the cheap ass that he is decided to save money and change all of the wrestlers entrance music!! Now if your a real ECW fan (and yes you know who you are) this is unaceptable! Seeing Sandman come out to generic rock instead of ""Enter Sandman"" isn't right and when New Jack comes out and wrestles to something that sounds straight out of GTA San Andreas and the music stops part way through the match, you know theres something wrong. Real ECW fans do not watch that crap on TV (ECW, RAW, or Smackdown), real ECW fans watch their old tapes or any of the DVDs released prior to this one (well other than that crap fest called ""December To Dismember""). Vinny killed wrestling and thats all there is to it. As for Disk # 2 well any real ECW fan would be disgusted with the fact that Rick Flair wrestled in a ECW ring and even more so for the title (especially since it wasn't against Shane who called him out for years). Quite simply disk 2 is WWE in the guise of ECW and I for one am not fooled. Long live the memory of the real ECW and a quick death to this abomination that is ECW now. Vinny You Suck!! He just needs to release all the old pay-per-views and the old ECW catalog on DVD (intact as is) they would fly off the shelf faster than any thing WWE. Personally I've all ready burnt all of my old ECW to disk (nearly 70 4 hour DVD's!!) so I'm good to go. Personaly I'd just like to see ECW put back on the market with the respect it deserves if it wasn't for ECW many wrestlers wouldn't have been discovered, there would have been less innovation in story lines, moves, and attitude cause lets face it WCW/NWO forced WWF to change their attitude and ECW forced both to change how their wrestlers wrestled (no more whimpy body slam as a finisher). And one last thing Paul Heyman and Todd Gordon were the real geniuses of wrestling Erik Bischoff and Vince McMahon were nothing but con artists and thieves, collectivly they runied wrestling.",1171152000,7,2147,4.239024390243903
2691310,4,B000KHX6ZO,"Okay, Bloodsport definatly had better matches on it as a whole collection but these two DVD's aren't horrible.  Yes, the first DVD is a lot better than the second because the old ECW was better than the new ECW.  ECW being run by Vince McMahon is a joke and it'll never be what it used to be.  That being said I had no problems with the matches on first disc, it was solid and well worth the price alone.  Now, yes like I said, I don't really like the new ECW but some of the matches are pretty good for it being under the rule of Vince McMahon.  The only match I seriously hated was RVD and Sabu Vs Test and Mike Knox because I hate Test and Mike Knox.  The only new ECW wretler I can seriously say that I like is CM Punk and I have been a fan of his for years following his career and I own many ROH shows featuring his great matches.  I guess you can say I am a CM Punk fan, not a new ECW fan.  Anyway, get this set for the first disc because it's great and think of the second disc of like an extra disc that was included as a bonus disc, although like I said it isn't horrible.",1170460800,9,1082,3.8863636363636362
2691311,1,B000KHX6ZO,"Like some of us, after the wild success of ECW One Night Stand 2006, I had high hopes for ECW on Sci-Fi---it was on a cable channel, and it was on late at night.

It's been more than half a year.  And I'm watching an hour-long extension to RAW and/or Smackdown.

Owning just about everything to do with ECW, Vince McMahon had a potential hit on his hands, and while he skimmed us in the One Night Stands by editing some ECW superstars' music and having his WWE talent barge in and compete (2006) or just whine and bitch that ECW sucks (2005), it was still extreme, and spellbinding to watch.

ECW on Sci-Fi is not a shell of old ECW---it's another brand of WWE with an ECW sticker slapped onto the screen.  The only original ECW wrestlers (""brilliantly"" labeled ""ECW Originals"") are the Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Sabu, Rob Van Dam, and Balls Mahoney.  Tazz doesn't wrestle.  The ""brilliantly"" labeled ""New Breed"" has some impressive-looking characters like Kevin Thorn and CM Punk, but the rest are the same stale WWE circus show of sad, unlikeable gimmicks like the extraordinarily dull Elijah Burke or the amazingly lame Mike Knox or the ever-present career-jobber Hardcore Holly (who seems to have been shoved into ECW brand simply because of his name ""Hardcore"")

Titles are likely to change hands maybe once every three or four PPVs, just like in WWE, matches feature an all-time low on athletics (save for when Sabu and RVD are at work), and an all-time high on pillow-strikes (wrestling term for cheap fake punches and stomps) and the storylines are as easily predictable as in WWE.

Disk 1 has matches from Old ECW.  Good.  But this DVD collection isn't about Old ECW.  It's about new ECW.  If you want a great collection of old ECW matches, try Blood Sport ECW: Most Violent Matches.

Tell Vince McMahon that he's made a mistake with this ""new breed"" of ECW, and with the firing of Paul Heyman, it's only gotten... just as dull as ever.  Don't support more of this.",1170460800,4,1972,4.642651296829971
2691312,5,B000KHX6ZO,"This is a great, GREAT, DVD. If you are new to ECW, I highly recommend buying this dvd. Joey Styles & Tazz introduce and give history behind the matches along with video footage. They also show footage of previous years. The first disc is broken down to the original ECW, and it has great matches. My favorite is the never before released onto DVD Tazz vs. Sabu to unify the ECW & FTW Titles. Disc 2 is the New ECW. If you have missed the new ECW and want to get caught up on the great matches, watch this disc. You will see history of all the new extremists and the best matches the new ECW has had to offer since One Night Stand 2005. If you are an ECW fan (old or new) and do not pick this up, you will be sorry you missed out.",1170288000,4,730,3.9727891156462585

Its not ECW and should be laid to rest rather than ruin the name of the greatest thing to happen to wrestling.  I saw Wrestling Society X last night and this owns anything in wrestling today even though theirs a few flaws but it has potential to blow away WWECW.  I say avoid this DVD.

It's cool to see what made ECW so ahead of it's time with some great classic matches from the Original ECW dayz
This is the second ECW best of dvd put out by WWE.
Need I say more?
The new ECW matches are pure garbage!
Ric Flair in a ECW ring vs The Big Slow how is that ECW ?
Ric Flair vs Shane Douglas in a ECW Ring would draw major fans & ticket sales

The smart thing for Vince and his puppet head marketing department to do is
Just Re-Release all the great ECW Commercial tapes on dvd
They would make a killing with the back catalog of ecw shows
 That would be way too smart to give the fans what they really like!

8156940,5,B000KHX6ZO,"I bought this DVD set at an electronics and appliances store.  There are two reasons to buy this DVD set.  The first one is for the ""Stairway To Hell"" match between The Sandman and Sabu.  In this match, both participants wrestle and fight one another, so that they can climb on top of a ladder in the middle of the ring, in order to get a coil of razor-tipped barbed wire to use as a weapon against their opponent.  In this match, The Sandman is on top of the ladder as Sabu knocks over the ladder.  The Sandman falls off the top of the ladder from 20 feet in the air, and crashes through two tables and down onto the concrete floor outside the ring.  It is one of the most dangerous falls ever recorded in the history of professional wrestling.  But to everyone's amazement, The Sandman recovers, and despite sustaining one of the worst, most bloodiest facial cuts in the history of the sport from the razor-tipped barbed wire, he fights on and pins Sabu in one of the most violent matches ever recorded.

The second reason to buy this DVD set, is for the ""High Incident"" Scaffold Match between Tommy Dreamer and ""Prime Time"" Brian Lee.  Former ECW announcer Joey Styles aptly described this match as ""the most dangerous Scaffold Match of all time"".  The reason for this description, is because there was not enough room in Viking Hall (in South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, also known as the ""ECW Arena"") for a second set of scaffolding to support the platform in the ceiling area correctly.  Instead, four heavy battleship ropes tied to steel girders holding up the ceiling of the building were used, and they were not secured completely tightly.  The platform was swinging back and forth as the wrestlers moved around on top of the platform on top of the scaffolding.  Below the platform inside the ring, were stacks of folding tables, stacked on top of one another, three tables high.  The loser of the match was thrown down from the top of the platform onto the stacks of tables, and then crashed down onto the ring floor.  But before the match ever started, Tommy Dreamer attacked ""Prime Time"" Brian Lee as he was entering the ring area, and the match started out as a ""Street Fight"" Match, and it eventually evolved into the ""Scaffold Match"", with its historic, crashing climax.

I highly recommend that you buy this DVD set.  You will not be disappointed.",1390348800,,2363,4.628297362110311
8156941,2,B000KHX6ZO,"I got this DVD long after production ceased through the Amazon Marketplace for $5, I would not recommend paying more for this set.  This is the worst of all of the WWE DVDs released.  I have a feeling this DVD was released in a hurry, trying to market itself as the ""best of wwe ecw 05-06"" and throwing disc 1 in there for the original ECW fans to make a quick buck.

 The opening segment is idiotic with the bimbo obviously trying to play on her plastic surgery.  Joey Styles and Taz are okay as hosts, we do get some vignette segments and highlights, but they seem like filler and don't fit with the rest of the footage.

Unfortunately, Disc 1 mostly contains footage previously released on Pioneer DVD releases.  The match list is okay, it does suffer from the typical theme music edits these dvds commonly have, but it is enjoyable.  There are some first-to-dvd released matches on here, I think the FTW championship match and the Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka match.  The Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka match a few weeks previous to the one on this set was much better though from Nashville, I have no idea why that one is not on this set instead.

Disc 2 is a waste of a printing press.  The highlights from ONS 05 and 06 are okay, but if you already own the dvd or have seen them its useless on this disc.  After the ONS matches, we are ""treated"" to the ECW on Scifi matches.  Admittingly, the matches on this set are the best matches that were shown on this horrid interpretation of ECW from WWE.  The Big Show vs. Ric Flair match is probably the best, I am quite surprised as Ric Flair never fought the ""garbage"" wrestling style before this.

Thankfully, the idiotic zombie segments from the scifi show are not contained on this set.

All in all, get the Pioneer DVD  first releases instead of this dvd if your looking to watch ECW on DVD.  I might also suggest the Rise and Fall of ECW DVD, Bloodsport, and the ECW unreleased DVDs.",1388880000,,1942,4.392156862745098
