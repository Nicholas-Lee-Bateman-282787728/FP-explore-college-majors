8145063,5,B000ICLU2C,Just got this video from my sister in law after having a double mastectomy and reconstruction same time.  I did so much Yin yoga before the surgery that I had good range of motion with in a week.  But not being able to go to classes for a while she brilliantly sought out a way for me..  I love my sister law!  I'm doing alittle each day and it's only going to get better.  Highly recommend this to anyone!  But check with your Dr first.  Bit my bit it will get better.,1491264000,,469,4.032608695652174
8145064,5,B000ICLU2C,"I had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction a couple of years ago.  I was shocked, post-surgery, to discover that I could not lift my arms above my shoulders.  My doctor insisted I did not need PT, so I found this video online and did it daily, then 3 times/week.  I got my full range of motion back.  Yes, the production values are not the best, but the exercises really work, and it helps that the instructor has been through this herself and is so understanding (""I couldn't even lift my arms over my head to put my T-shirt on"")  and encouraging.  Watching her, I believed that I could get back to normal, even though at first my efforts seemed pretty pathetic.  I would highly recommend this video to any woman who has undergone a mastectomy.",1408492800,,751,4.518518518518518
8145065,5,B000ICLU2C,I had a radical mastectomy with 27 lympth nodes removed. This CD has been great. I follow it every day. It is awesome.,1402185600,,118,4.173913043478261
8145066,4,B000ICLU2C,"I bought this DVD for a friend who has recently undergone a double mastectomy.  Never having had breast surgery myself, I can only imagine the ""tightness"" one must feel through the chest area afterward.  Through a series of both standing and floor exercises, Alice softly and calmly talks you through lifting your arm higher and higher until you can lift it to your chest, then your shoulder, then over your head (over time, not in one workout!)  She follows up the stretching exercises with ""mindful meditation.""  Alice is gently encouraging, and the garden setting is very relaxing.  For the price, this is an excellent DVD for someone beginning rehabilitation after breast surgery.",1300320000,,684,5.071428571428571
