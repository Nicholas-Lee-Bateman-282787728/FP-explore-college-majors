Google it and you will find tons of examples Sam Kinison, Bill cosby, joe rogan, ari schaeffer and many more.

Carlos is just one of the funniest comedians I've seen, and this DVD proves it. I've watched it a couple of times now, and even though I know the jokes, it's still funny. I enjoyed it so much, I just ordered another one of his DVD's. You can't go wrong with this. If you don't like foul language or have little ones around, this isn't for you.

The best thing of this is that his jokes and comments are accurate and for the most part are true.

2609016,3,B000GG4Y3W,"I just saw Carlos Mencia last night (2013Feb9) in San Jose at a comedy club, a club to remain unnamed.  We wanted to check out the club for ourselves since we like comedy, and we've never been to that one before.  Suffice it to say, I will never return to the comedy club in San Jose, even though Anthony Jeselnik and Harland Williams are both on their schedule soon.  (I've seen Mr. Jeselnik in concert, and he is very funny.  The whole ""baby in the dryer"" routine almost made me cry.  I've seen Mr. Harland doing stand-up on Comedy Central, and his hillbilly schtick kills me.)  And after last night, I'll never return to a Mencia concert again either.

Oh, don't get me wrong.  I still find some of Mr. Mencia's jokes funny, even though I believe that he needs to update his material for today's world.  And he was nice enough to sign a DVD for me -- this one, to be exact, which he also gave me since I was a VIP -- which I might even watch.  His biggest issue though:  I believe that he needs to rethink his opening acts.  And then perhaps 86 them, just like the waitresses wanted to do themselves at the comedy club last night.  (I watched one waitress walk by during one very offensive joke and she got really mad and shook her head.  In the hallway, I asked her, ""Isn't this supposed to be a comedy club?""  She smiled, wanted to curse, and just walked away.)

Mr. Mencia had about three opening acts, and none of them were very funny, but all of them were fairly rude.  I kept thinking to myself, ""Self, if Jerry Seinfeld were here tonight, what would he say about this stuff?""  And not to put words in that very fine comedian's mouth, but I believe that he might say -- OK, so I almost KNOW exactly what he would say because he's said these words ad nauseum in interviews in the past -- ""If you can't tell a joke without swearing then I don't think that you're really a comedian.""  And this surely applied to almost all of the ""comedians"" last night; all they did was swear and they thought that it was funny.  Unfortunately, many of the very blue-collar crowd laughed with them, which seemed to egg on the comedians even more to swear some more.

And I thought about something else last night, too.  One of the opening acts was black (that's all well and good by me; I'm a huge fan of Dave Chappelle and I wish that he'd come back to TV), but this guy kept using the N-word.  And yes, I almost cringe just writing or saying the joke-of-a-euphemism ""N-word,"" as I find it more offensive myself that the word that it replaces.  But anyways, I was thinking about Charles Barkley and his take on the use of this word.  After last night I am convinced that Mr. Barkley is wrong; no, make that completely wrong.  And I'm also convinced of the following:  either everyone should be able to use it, or no one should be able to use it.  Period.

And my opinion on this is so strong now that I will make the following recommendation:  anyone who uses it in public gets a fine.  Yes, I am perhaps Freedom of Speech's biggest supporter, but I supposedly can't say this word, so no one else should be able to use it either.  And there are some groups that are losing their fight by continuing to use it, and you know who they are.  Perhaps you haven't lost yet, but it is inevitable that you will.

So I say, ""Stop using the N-word in public -- either the real word of its replacement -- and that applies to everyone.  And I've got no strings attached to Carlos Mencia anymore either, especially after the mess-of-a-comedy show that I unfortunately witnessed last night.""  Adios, Carlos.",1391990400,,3584,4.352941176470588

He used to make me a bit uncomfortable because I hate prejudice but I realize now that Carlos is a comedian and he's saying those things with one objective, nothing else ... to make us all laugh!

2609051,1,B000GG4Y3W,"Probably one of the worst comedian's of all time that gets attention. His material comes from senarios about standing up to people that he doesnt agree with- how hard is that? Thats like me saying i hate abortion and then talking about women who get abortions. Untalented prick who tries to play it off like he's smart but he's not. He constantly blames the crowd for not catching his so called joke's. I didn't like him to begin with but i gave him a chance on this dvd. I only laffed once and I shut it off 45min. in. It just wasn't entertaining. Definetly a dvd for the weak minded stupid poeple of America. Carlos mencia to the rescue with his unimpressive, lack of creativity, idiodic views on the world. one word. Horrible-",1263340800,6,729,4.488721804511278
2609052,3,B000GG4Y3W,"Owe how I looked forward to this dvd. The extra footage and jokes were going to be great. Well I was wrong. Now it is not to say that the whole thing is bad owe no there are many great moments and jokes in it but it is the biggest mistakes he makes that ruined it for me.

First the Civil War despite what anyone has told you was not fought over slavery and the South even abolished slavery before the end of the war. Second God is definitely not a female and to judge the ethereal world based on our worlds standards is well to quote him Dee Dee Dee. Not to mention that men back in the day of bible were not as they are today. Not that I am hating on the females owe no. What is is though. Our Father, Father forgive them but they do not know what they do, and most of all we call him god not goddess and yes there is a difference. Ask a Wiccan.

No I am sorry but these ignorant statements just ruined an otherwise great show. I believe there were more as it has been awhile since I watched the dvd. Now everything else I loved but I can't stand ignorant statements the level that were made. Worst yet is when someone calls you stupid for knowing the actual facts. I can see why those parts were edited out of the live broadcast they would have sunk the ratings to nothing. Though rejoice there is an TV version of the special which does live up to the comedy.

Not everything that was edited out was bad but some were just atrociously horrible. But hey this dvd is a comedy which is supposed to make me laugh or at least enjoy myself and if it is pissing me off then I believe it did a complete round about from its original destination.

This is why I have to place it 50/50. Now I am not a stickler for accuracy but some things just tend to rub me the wrong way and this did. I leave it with nether a recommend or don't recommend. Though I would tend to not as I wouldn't want to such ignorance to reach peoples ears.",1240012800,,1923,4.039370078740157

2609058,5,B000GG4Y3W,"First off, the dvd, well worth the money! I personally agree with most of what he says and i admire his bluntness.

As for the whole issue with him and stealing jokes....yes, he is Honduran...He has never tried to hide this but he does explain that his mother is Mexican. Now, when anyone looked at him, what was the first thing anyone prolly thought? Mexican! sad truth of the world, but there it is. So since his shows live off stereotypes and (honestly, no one can say that they don't exist for no reason) and he's stereotypcially a Mexican....then the white people are getting mad at him for stealing.....

In closing, ""Race makes everything funny"" and i hope He continues to make more shows and episodes!

p.s.

As you can prolly guess, I'm not White, I'm Guatemalan, but i'm still confused for Mexican all the time >_<;;",1178496000,2,826,4.598639455782313
