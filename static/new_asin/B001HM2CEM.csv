3630534,1,B001HM2CEM,"Zero stars. Acting and writing were on par with a class film. Surprisingly some of the cinematography was ok, but not enough to rescue this one.",1471910400,,144,4.576923076923077
3630535,3,B001HM2CEM,It's okay. Kind of a made for TV movie. Action with a little bit of romance.,1470700800,,76,3.8125
3630536,5,B001HM2CEM,"If you think this movie was made like this to be serious then I think you missed the whole point. This is a B movie that is meant to be stupid, overacted, silly, and ridiculous. Unless of course you believe that a nine year old director really tried his best to make an A rated  professional action movie then please by all means place your one star and let everyone know about the bad acting, script, filming, special FX, directing, and the other hundreds of things that really don't make any sense in this TRUE and AUTHENTIC attempt at professional movie making.",1469836800,2,564,4.529411764705882
3630537,4,B001HM2CEM,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I didn't think I would from all the bad reviews, but then again, I usually do go against the grain!  I didn't go into this expecting a Matt Damon or Tom Cruise action movie, so I wasn't judging this compared to them.  Consequently I had a good time enjoying this.  I'll probably watch it again sometime.",1469059200,,333,4.409836065573771
3630538,1,B001HM2CEM,it sucked. Very unrealistic!!,1467244800,,29,6.5
3630539,1,B001HM2CEM,waste of an hour and a half,1466208000,,27,3.0
3630540,5,B001HM2CEM,it wound up being more than what I expected reminder to keep everyone close to you regardless of who they are because you have to expect the unexpected from not only outsiders but even more so your family,1430870400,,204,4.394736842105263
3630541,1,B001HM2CEM,"Bad writing, bad acting, bad dialog. Even the blood looks cheap.
If it didn't seem to be a serious attempt at a movie, it might be funny. At 30 minutes in, it is just painful.",1237766400,,175,4.0285714285714285
3630542,4,B001HM2CEM,"Some reviewers of this movie take it way too seriously.....cheesy but 'realistic' dialog and deadpan amateur acting, but at the same time cool and funny....likable, engaging characters.....this has cult written all over it.

If you have a sense of humor, and are a real, down to earth person, you'll like this film.",1237593600,,315,5.0576923076923075
3630543,3,B001HM2CEM,"John Will Clay is very Talented,loved the special effects. Ashley Morgan has talent those Angelina lips and pretty eyes!  Buck  was really funny should consider funny roles..  enjoyed the movie. Can't wait to see the next film of these young stars!",1234742400,,248,5.0
8308995,4,B001HM2CEM,"OK, it's not Die Hard 4.0, but if you consider that it's the first effort of a small group of independent film makers, who wrote, produced, edited, scored, and everything else, it was a truly outstanding effort.
Good plot, and funny acting. Remember how stiff the acting was in the first Star Trek (TOS) movie? ""Wrath of Khan"" was the next one in the series, and it was maybe the best.
I'm looking forward to their next effort. Remember the first time you did something? You got better the next time, right?",1523923200,,507,4.521739130434782

8309002,1,B001HM2CEM,The worst acting I've seen thus far. I think high school drama students would have done a better joy. The script was als poorly written.,1476921600,,136,4.48
