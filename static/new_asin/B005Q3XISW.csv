8482901,5,B005Q3XISW,"I have just seen this wonderful movie the second time in two years.  Since I just saw it last year, I didn't know if I would watch it all the way through, but the directing and acting and story are so captivating that I just sat there completely entranced and watched the whole thing again.

I have many times felt the way our time traveler does in this story; so fascinated by the events of the past that I wanted to go there, even if only to visit for a while. And this movie captures that feeling better than any other time travel movie I have ever seen.  So if you have ever felt that way about visiting a time in the past, you will probably love this movie just as much as I did.

The script and directing are solid and coherent with no logical errors so you always know what's going on, and nothing is confusing.

And certain scenes are done to overwhelming perfection with great effect, like when the psychic cousin insists on looking into the time traveler's eyes and he finally lets her, she sees the future with all it's big machines and planes and battleships and bombs to her great horror...  She's such a sweet, innocent thing from such a simple time to be viewing all that at once, I just cried and cried for her.  That's how effective that scene was written, directed, acted, and filmed, and it's not the only one.  Many scenes are done really very well in this most enjoyable movie.",1434153600,,1398,4.35

Now I know why the chemistry of Leslie Howard worked so well in GWTW. He was most dashing! The attempt to portray time travel and it's fearful interpretations was impressive and laid the groundwork for ""Back to the Future"" and others as well.

I enjoyed the peculiar moments of slip ups in modern, for 1933, language and mannerisms in 1784 London. The actual transitions from one time to another was awkward but having limited expectations this presented no problem from an otherwise exciting plot.

My biggest issue was the glimpse of our future with the wars, speed, violence, and loud noise complimented with a grand finale fireworks display. Who would want to be part of that mess? Well, a plot device to prevent anyone switching places, I assume the trap had to be set.

God's timeframe seemed to provide little satisfaction unless one passes at 23. However, it was a romantic interlude that is seldom created even in today's films. Interesting to note this may have been the first film mention of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who was portrayed in ""The Duchess"".

High recommend for Howard fans, time travel, British vs Colonials, and eternal love.",1427241600,,1200,4.920792079207921
8482903,3,B005Q3XISW,"American that inherits house in England is obsessed with former inhabitants associated with a distant relative who also came from America just after the War Of Independence,  He ignores his contemporary fiance and is literally drawn into the past, and as we learn later off stage his counterpart is drawn into the future.  Being out of time, both of them make a mess of things.

He becomes obsessed with his would be sister-in-law of the past, betrothed in a loveless marriage, who is the image of his present day fiance.  She sees the future as he sees the past.  He finally returns to the present, and after visiting her grave vows to be alone until they are reunited in the afterlife.

Tragedy that may not hit you until after the show.  Perhaps Henry James meant in his unfinished The Sense Of The Past is that the hero doesn't appreciate what he has now, but has been living in the past, and his past lover obsesses about her forlorn future instead of taking charge of it.

Probably inspired the movie Somewhere In Time, which doesn't have the same feel.",1424736000,,1059,4.595744680851064
8482904,4,B005Q3XISW,"They need to upgrade this movie... twas fun even though the audio was at times poor. The movie only goes to prove, run with what you have; a bird in the hand....",1411430400,,161,4.0625
8482905,5,B005Q3XISW,"This is a fascinating time travel movie (1933) and perhaps the first of its kind that tells the story of a young American who goes back in time to London, after American Revolution, and meets his ancestors and his fianc&eacute;e. Unlike the modern day box office hit, ""Back to the Future,"" starring Michael Fox, in this movie Leslie Howard as Peter Standish goes to his family, which obviously creates some strange situations. For example, during the conversation with his fianc&eacute;e and other members of the family he seems to know the future and predict events as it would happen. This makes them very suspicious and uncomfortable of this visitor from future. Sometimes it gets a little amusing since these folks belong to another culture are ill at ease when Standish uses modern English and puts himself in awkward situation. This is secondary to the romantic fantasy that evolves but which he doesn't anticipate. He had pledged his love to one woman, but falls in love with her sister played by Heather Angel. This becomes a fantasy and the love story where he and Helen Pettigrew (Heather Angel) expresses true love for each other. They both starred in the Broadway version and it naturally builds up in the movie when they become caring couple. Helen understands that Peter is from the future and through his eyes sees the destructions of war and the cultural change brought forth by technologies, it terrifies her. On the other hand Peter is nauseated with the lack of good hygiene of the 18th century folks, and public hangings, etc., stirs his conscious, hence he doesn't want to stay in the past. The sad truth of the story is that Standish must accept the fact he will never find Helen in future, and thinking about someone long dead is very much in his mind. He lives in a state of emotional despair looking for the woman he loved 200 year ago.

Time travel is a fascinating concept for centuries for human beings and Hollywood is no exception to this mythical reality. Although this movie is more than 80 years old, the possibility of going back in time is increasingly real and possible according to the current understanding of quantum physics and recent developments in technology.

Leslie Howard offers a brilliant performance as Peter Standish and rightfully nominated for the Academy Award in the best actor category. I strongly recommend this movie to all fans of Leslie Howard and anyone interested in back to the future movies. Very fascinating indeed!",1403740800,,2479,4.872037914691943
8482906,4,B005Q3XISW,"BERKELEY SQUARE was a succes d'estime of the late Twenties and early Thirties.  Based on a short story - THE SENSE OF THE PAST  - by Henry James, it tells the story of how Peter Standish (Leslie Howard) travels back in time from the contemporary world into the late eighteenth century, and discovers to his cost that life isn't quite as idyllic as the history books might suggest.  John L. Balderston's script isn't without its sentimental moments, but generally takes a hard-nosed look at the ways in which individuals remain as self-centered in the past as they might have been over a century ago.  Leslie Howard, who created the past of Standish on the Broadway stage, here recreates his part; he doesn't have to do much other than to look bewildered, which he achieves very competently.  Valerie Taylor makes an ideal romantic interest.  Director Frank Lloyd was one of Twentieth Century-Fox's most competent contract directors; his version of Noel Coward's CAVALCADE (1933), based on another theatrical hit, is particularly memorable.  In BERKELEY SQUARE he creates a brisk narrative, containing a memorable series of transitions between past and present.  Definitely worth a look if a copy of the film can be found.",1372809600,3,1221,5.039800995024875
8482907,5,B005Q3XISW,I have  been looking for this movie for a long time and was so happy to find it. The movie stopped working briefly in a few spots but the quality was not too bad considering the age of the movie.,1362355200,2,195,3.875
8482908,4,B005Q3XISW,"I saw BERKELEY SQUARE for the first time ever this past week when TCM had its premiere screening of the film. This sucker isn't even available anymore (if ever) on VHS, and it's rarely on DVD (I'm not sure about Betamax). This is the film for which Leslie Howard earned his first Oscar nomination. According to some old sage, this 1933 film adaptation is based on John Balderston's stage play which in turn is inspired by a Henry James story. Lead actors Leslie Howard and lovely Heather Angel reprise their stage roles. BERKELEY - which I learned is pronounced ""Barkley"" - SQUARE is a time travel fantasy, and a bit talky. And when I say ""a bit talky"" I mean that the exposition runs wild. But I liked it. If there'll be an avalanche of dialogue, then I'd rather the Brits do the talking. I dig the accent, and things seem to mean more.

There's much concern over Peter Standish (Howard), that brooding American who seems much too obsessed with his inherited home in Berkeley Square, with its centuries of history and its past inhabitants. On September 3, 1933, Peter Standish, by dint of sheer will, travels 149 years to the past, to the year 1784. In the 18th Century, Peter slips into the form of his look-alike ancestor of the same name, Yankee Captain Peter Standish, who had just fought in the American Revolution under General Washington himself.

BERKELEY SQUARE is very much a film of its era, nowadays a bit dated and stilted. Sound was very much a newfangled thing to cinema back in 1933 and filmmakers were in love with all things British, from the culture to the elegant, well-modulated actors to the adaptations of prestigious plays. BERKELEY SQUARE is shot like a stage play, lending it a more intimate but also more confined look. And yet you can see why the director opted to go this route. Someone's always talking, you see.

Even in 1933, that familiar time travel constraint surfaces. Modern-day Peter Standish, eyeing the past, is well aware that events must unfold in exactly the same manner. But Peter's a bit of a doofus, or maybe he's so out of sorts by what's happening that he can't help committing a series of blunders... his unrelentlingly odd behavior, his wayward remarks. Peter inhabits his ancestor's body just as his ancestor was visiting his poor relations in Berkeley Square (and this is when the Jane Austen influence comes into play). In 1784, Peter Standish is engaged to his cousin Kate Pettigrew (Valerie Taylor), but he becomes smitten with younger sister Helen (Heather Angel), a lovely girl who had vowed to never marry. This is a cue then to mention that BERKELEY SQUARE, besides being a time travel fantasy and a biting comedy of manners, also happens to be one of those sweeping star-crossed love stories. Somewhere in this film, one character is heard to sigh: ""There's never been a kiss like that since the world began.""

Isn't it our practice to romanticize the past? Except that BERKELEY SQUARE casts a skeptic eye on nostalgia, and then goes on to condemn the present. Initially intoxicated with his historical surroundings, Peter Standish gradually becomes disillusioned with the 18th Century, with its lack of refinement and its antiquated manners and with its stink. Peter finds that he simply cannot adapt and settle in. He remains the perennial fish out of water. More, his peculiar conduct and mysterious observations and seemingly prescient knowledge have inspired suspicion and alarm from those around him. In ""this new age of speed and invention,"" superstition and fear of the unknown still carried weight. Peter Standish is soon accused of dabbling in the occult, of being a body-possessing demon. I'd become a bit frustrated with Peter's incessant fumbles and his overbearing sense of superiority by then, and so I almost thought he deserved that jolt of anxiety.

Someday there'll be a DVD available, and then a parade will be thrown, probably. Me, I was lucky enough to set up my DVR, so I have a ready copy. BERKELEY SQUARE is talky, but the cast delivers their lines with panache and convincingly navigates thru a narrative set in the vanishing old empire. Leslie Howard easily anchors the film, and there's something about him, a presence, a quality, I don't know. But I've always found him so watchable. In a way, the plot - concerning a man who deliriously travels to the past only to grow increasingly uneasy in his time there - dovetails almost perfectly with The Twilight Zone. I liked the tonal shift. The story starts out as an almost frothy comedy of manners but then transitions into the macabre. This is an odd film, but, I think, an enjoyable one. Peter Standish, a gentleman of moods, once glamorized the past. And then the past rebuffed him. If you're looking for a film that discombobulates, if you want something off the beaten path, BERKELEY SQUARE'll do you. But good luck trying to grab a copy.",1343606400,20,4881,4.805952380952381
8482909,4,B005Q3XISW,"""Berkeley Square"" is a 1933 fantasy romantic comedy based on John Balderston successful 1929 stage play (which itself was based on a story by Henry James ""The Sense of the Past""). It is one of the very first films to deal with time travel - A 20th Century American mysteriously transports himself to London just after the American Revolution where he inhabits the body of his ancestor.

Leslie Howard (1893-1943) appeared in the stage play and reprises his role as the time traveler in the film. He started in films in the U.K. in 1914 and came to the U.S. in 1930. His big breakthrough came in with this film and in his brief career and 34 films Howard was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Berkeley Square"" and ""Pygmalion"") and gave us a memorable performance in ""GWTW"" (1939).

Mary Astor look-alike Heather Angel (1909-86) plays Howard's 18th Century love interest just as she did in the play. She's best known for her continuing role in the ""Bulldog Drummond"" series, and was popular in the 30s in films like ""The Hound of Baskervilles"" (1932) and ""Orient Express"" (1934).

Alan Mowbray (1896-1969) has a brief role. He appeared in more than 140 films from 1931 to 1962. He had a recurring role in the ""Topper"" series and made memorable contributions to films such as ""The King and I"" (1956), ""The Man who Knew Too Much"" (1956), ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) and ""Wagon Master"" (1950).

Look for Samuel Hinds (1875-1948) in a moustache as trhe U.S. Ambassador. Hinds was the fireworks- making father in ""You Can't Take It With You"" (1938). Despite beginning his film career at the age of 54, Hinds made 200+ films and is best known as Dr. Stephen Kildare from the film series.

Director Frank Lloyd (1886-1960) was a major figure in the 30s, nominated for an Oscar 4 times and winning for ""The Divine Lady"" (1929) and ""Cavalcade"" (1933). Among his notable films are "":Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1935), ""Blood on the Sun"" (1945), and my favorite Jim Bowie biography ""The Last Command"" (1955).

Lloyd's use of the montage was ahead of its time, and he uses it to great effect in this film as he did in ""Cavalcade"" - When Angel looks into Howard's eyes she sees the future.

1933 was a good year for films. Box office hits were Mae West's  ""I'm no Angel"" and ""She Done Him Wrong"", the star studded ""Dinner at Eight"", Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell in ""42nd Street"",  ""King Kong"", and Garbo in ""Queen Christina"". The Oscar winners were ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (Actor), ""Morning Glory"" (Actress) and ""Cavalcade"" (Picture). Other notable films released that year included the Marx Brothers' ""Duck Soup"", Laurel and Hardy's classic ""Sons of the Desert"", and ""The Invisible Man"". Fred  Astaire and Ginger Rogers made their film duo debut in ""Flying Down to Rio"". FWIW - 1933 was the year that Walt Disney referred to the gold statue as an ""Oscar"" when he won it for ""The Three Little Pigs"".

The NY Times said - ""In the matter of poetic charm, nothing quite like it has emerged from Hollywood. It is an example of delicacy and restraint, a picture filled with gentle humor and appealing pathos. It is in a class by itself...""

The film was remade in 1951 as ""I'll Never Forget You"" with Tyrone Power in the lead role, and many elements appear in the hauntingly beautiful ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980).

In addition to giving us a melancholy romance, the film has lots to say about how the reality of a romanticized past doesn't match up to expectations. Howard is often repulsed by the practices of the 18th Century.

My favorite time travel films include ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980), ""12 Monkeys"" (1995), ""The Lake House"" (2006)  and ""The Final Countdown"" (1980). For kicks, there's ""Back to the Future"" (1985), ""Groundhog Day"" (1993), ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" (1989), ""Disney's The Kid"" (2000), and Terry Gilliam's ""Time Bandits"" (1981).

Bottom line - definitely interesting and well done, although by today's standards it may seem lacking. If you can appreciate it for when it was made, you'll really enjoy it.",1343260800,12,4017,4.75
