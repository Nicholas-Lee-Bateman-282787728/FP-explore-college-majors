3521604,5,B001D25LSU,"I was a bit worried going into Part 3 of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.  The beginning of this final chapter appeared much more mature, somber, and at times downright depressing.  But luckily that was just a momentary departure from the series' signature high-blown mega-scale fist-pumping F**K YEAH crazy overdrive insanity.  Like its predecessors, Part 3 delivers the goods with plenty of comic relief, and heaping helpings of some of the most ludicrously explosive giant robot battles you'll ever see, and then somehow manages to magnify their scope by literally hundreds of times (Simon takes the helm of a mecha so massive, it uses galaxies as stepping stones).

Gurren Lagann shatters the borders of rationality, blithely discarding any notion of limitation or restraint.  It spins up, rips loose and rampages nonstop through every episode.  Just sit back and let this chaotic spectacle of imagination unfold before your eyes.  You won't regret it!",1267747200,,951,5.258278145695364
3521605,5,B001D25LSU,"Gurren Lagann is one of the best anime titles out there. It's art style is what sets it apart from all the rest. This crazy hand drawn style (though I'm not entirely sure if it is hand drawn) may turn off some, but I personally dig it. I knew what to expect after buying Dead Leaves. This is a bit more tame (story wise) compared to Dead Leaves, but still off the chain none the less. The story line is great. There is a little over the top acting at times but that is kinda like the soul of this series. The whole freaking crew is over the top! And I love that about it!
This is the final two volumes packaged as Part 3. It was worth every dollar spent, and I highly recommend it!

They now have the complete series for a cheaper price.",1255305600,,737,4.0479452054794525
3521606,4,B001D25LSU,the product was great and had a reasonable price. only downfall was that it was subtitled. This can be bothersum to some people,1247184000,,127,4.565217391304348
3521607,5,B001D25LSU,"FYI, I'm going to be duplicating this review for the other two parts in this series. I've been a hardcore anime fan since the mid 80's, I even purchase a lot of Japanese region exclusive anime. I've watched them all, from ROBOTECH to GaoGaiGar to Witchblade. And Gurren Lagann is a very, very good anime series. One of the best.

  The story is very well paced, reminiscent of Gunbuster (the original OVA, not the new series). Sorry, I'm not going to give away any hint of spoilers in this review. But let me say that the character development and evolution is handled as well as any anime or film I've seen.

  Gurren Lagann's style is a mix of Naruto and GaoGaiGar. Familiarize yourself with those series if you haven't already. Basically it's just WAY over the top!! It doesn't matter if it's the characters, weapons or scale. If the scene can be made any more spectacular, it is. I can't say enough about this series, other than BUY IT!! Support this kind of high grade anime!! And hopefully we can get more amazing anime series like this in the future. Thanks.",1237075200,,1065,4.549738219895288
3521608,5,B001D25LSU,This is the greatest anime every made. The DVD doesn't really offer any extras...or an English version...but it is an amazing world that everyone should experience.,1229472000,,164,5.346153846153846
3521609,5,B001D25LSU,"A fitting end to one of the best anime of 2007. Unlike Gainax series before it, the ending makes sense. Well, not logical sense, but this is Gurren Lagann. But it does follow that crazy brand of GL sense, and it keeps its seriousness tempered with mind-blowing animation and energy. If anyone, and I mean anyone, did not get some manly mist-eyes in episode 26, they have no soul. Again, the ending couldn't have been better. Highly recommended.",1224806400,,444,4.705128205128205
3521610,5,B001D25LSU,"I absolutely love this series.  Underneath the flash, action, surreality, completely bizarro and truly HUGE scale events of cosmic destruction and rebirth is a very touching story about friendship, love, and ""fighting spirit"" to transcend the bonds of despair.  This is an absolute must have series.  Its at turns exciting, funny, action-packed, ridiculous, visually edgy / eye-popping, stunning, surreal, touching, sad, exploitative and flat out mind-blowing in scale.  You gotta see it to believe it.  Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it.  Highly recommended.

Oh, and this volume concludes the series brilliantly.  Just get 'em all if you don't have 'em.  They're essentials.

Prepare to break through the karmic cycle of never-ending battle with your drill, Gurren Lagann!",1222732800,,788,5.43801652892562
3521611,5,B001D25LSU,one of the best mecha shows ever made. ever anime fan owes it to themselves to check this out,1221782400,,93,3.9473684210526314
3521612,3,B001D25LSU,"Great Sasuke & Orihara vs Duck Togo & Psychic- Its more of a wrestling match then a hardcore match, despite the fact that ladders, and night sticks are used. The Great Sasuke loses his mask but quickly returns with a Sasuke the Great mask (His partners old  name). A few good moves, but nothing too special. Grade C+

Sekimoto & Shimoda vs Ito & Teioh- Well again this wasn't a hardcore match at all. This was a 10 year anniversary celebration for Teioh against 3 of his students. It was slow moving and you could tell a lot of people where holding back. Grade C-

Shadow WX vs Mad Man Pondo- We finally saw a hardcore match. We saw a few big shots, and some light tubes. The match just seemed like it was getting moving and we had a weak finish. Grade B-

Yamakawa vs Bad Boy Hido- This was a great match. They must have used 10,000 thumb tacks. Yamakawa heads was filled with thumb tacks. Many great moves and both of them seemed like nothing would get the pin. Then a terrible finish. Grade B+

Why do we always have the worst announcers money can buy? All I want is a guy who is excited to call the match, and has some good wrestling knowledge. Instead we one guy totally dead and boring. The other sounds like an imbecile. The DVD is only 1 hour and 15 minutes and you only get 4 matches. That is always disappointing. The DVD is ok but there are much better DVD's out there. The last match was almost an A+ but the finish was very disappointing. Overall Grade C+",1182902400,,1468,4.247311827956989

8290997,5,B001D25LSU,"There are just no words in the English language to describe how awesome and satisfying Gurren Laggan's ending is. After it's over you look back to the start of the series, realizing the amazing adventure they had, how they started out so small and weak below the ground and how they fought their way up until they challenged the freaking Moon and after that they killed a god, basically. The feelings, the emotions and the realization of it all leaves you mind-blown for the rest of your life. It's really the perfect synthesis and love letter to the old mechas of the 70's and 80's, superbly well-handled. So much fun, manly, actiony, cartoony, hilarious and epic. After you're done you will remember it for the rest of your life.",1388620800,,731,4.674418604651163

8291002,5,B001D25LSU,"Gainax does it again. The ending isn't quite as epic as the rest of the story, but the journey getting there was singular and Studio Gainax at some of it's best. Some of the most unique and colourful animation I've seen in years, with an obvious nod to Marvel Comics of the 1960's. Highly recommended.",1290556800,,301,4.490909090909091
8291003,5,B001D25LSU,Gurren Lagann is one of my favcorite animes of all time. It's basically a parody of Gundam or similar mech based anime with that Gainax off the wall twist.,1270857600,,155,4.379310344827586
