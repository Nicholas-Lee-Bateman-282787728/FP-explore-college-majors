6209019,5,B00HUAH0QU,"Four real tall structures, each a record, from China to UK to US, each with a completely different style of architecture and purpose to serve different clients in locations where each building has to be designed and build with all new technologies not all common to the architecture and building industry practices of today's structures due to the height and shape of the building as well as needs, life style, history, security, memory, pride and more importantly offering what no other building has ever offered before, in a documentary, four hours long which has taken years to produce with great cinematography. Informative and educational DVD regardless if you are in AEC (architecture, engineering, construction) or any other trade since there is so much offered in every aspect of the development of these projects which has and will impact thousands of lives in so many different parts of all three continents prior, during and after completion. The billion dollar residential development in US has more to do with the finish stages of construction and interior designing process which is extremely entertaining since after all we are not talking about furnishing a single residential unit for just few dollars, we are talking about dealing with details, painstaking details where majority building their custom homes will be satisfy enough in purchasing the best Carrara marble available from a local seller in US but not for the developers of One57 skyscraper where the interior designer has to fly to Carrara, Italy in order to see the exact pieces in the quarry with the right shade of color, good veins, not spotty, clean white, not cracked, etc. for many multi-million dollar units with few units selling over one hundred million dollar which will have its discriminating clientele from every point of the globe, to seal the deal in the most competitive real estate market, in the most prestigious neighborhoods in the world, Manhattan with floor to ceiling view of the Central Park, unmatched to any other view from surrounding structures, at least all for the time being till the next set of super skyscrapers of the future.

A century ago, a genius claimed ""Skyscraper is a machine that makes land pay"" and these four super skyscrapers certainly will not disappoint anyone, absolutely guaranteed. Bravo.",1393027200,5,2320,5.121372031662269

8635874,5,B00HUAH0QU,"I saw segments of this on PBS, and would watch it over again as much of it is interesting.  I originally wanted to be an architect and how they conquered their challenges in each building is fascinating stuff.  Especially in the tight quarters of the Leadenhall Building in London.  Having it in HD is icing on the cake.",1492128000,,320,4.482758620689655

8635879,3,B00HUAH0QU,"The first three episodes were good in that they covered three remarkable skyscrapers, each with a unique design. But we didn't get enough time on the engineering and construction of them, and we got too much time with the workers. (Which makes me sound like a misanthrope, but I'm not. I just hate people. ^__^)

Too much time was wasted hearing individual workers (""I come from a long family of ironmen. My grandfather was an ironman, my father was an ironman, my uncles were ironmen, my...."" ""It's showtime, baby!"" in NYC) that could have been better used to inform us of the challenges of these amazing buildings. I want to know more about sanitation systems, elevators, and especially cranes. The few minutes in the Shanghai episode on raising a crane one floor only whetted my appetite. Without any of these three elements, skyscrapers would not be possible. In this series, we learn next to nothing about them.

The last segment, on the Billionaire Building, seemed a complete waste of time. Well, I shouldn't say that, as I stopped watching about a quarter hour in, and maybe it got better. Was the intent to have us drool in envy at those who can afford almost $100 million for an apartment? Should we care about the financing of the construction and the selling of the apartments? Why was this segment included at all?

I didn't need the background music that often made the narrator hard to understand. It made me wonder if these programs were intended to be education or entertainment. (17 March 2015, I watch another PBS series, ""America Revealed."" The intrusion of music here is even worse than in ""Skyscrapers."" What is wrong with silence? Why does PBS think we need background music to make us excited? Isn't learning exciting enough?)

The discs had plenty of time for extra features, but there were none. In addition to the elements I mentioned above (sanitation, elevators, cranes), I'd also like to learn about the role of computers in designing buildings of such complexity and close tolerance, and the education that architects receive to design these astonishing buildings. But there are no extra features, none at all. Unforgiveable, perhaps a reflection of the missed focus of the series.

Kudos, though, to the film crew. Their cameras went everywhere, sometimes, it was clear, at some danger.

Thanks also for what we did get, and why three stars from me: a better understanding of some -- but not enough -- of what goes into constructing one of these monumental buildings.

This could have been an indispensable set of programs about skyscrapers, but it's just a first step, regrettably, and it stumbles. I'm looking forward to the next effort.

(You're right, my disappointment in this set of discs is almost personal. That's because I see architecture as among the noblest efforts of man, combining art and engineering to give us shelter, one of our basic needs. If I believed in reincarnation, I'd ask to come back as a darned good architect.)",1424476800,4,2973,4.873267326732673

8635881,5,B00HUAH0QU,"Skyscrapers have become the symbols of our modern cities. This 2 package DVD set illustrates 4 skyscrapers during their construction, which are individual symbols. There are English subtitles for the hard of hearing.

 1st is 1 world Trade Center, called the building of the future, but a symbol of so much more right up to its 1,776 feet. We see the difficulties of building so high from getting cement up to the highest floors to installing glass and having to watch the wind speed. The goal was to make this building indestructible.
For any tall structure, the DVD points out, there is sway. Winds around the 400foot level can reach 100 miles an hour and create a sucking force, even when there is hardly any wind at all at ground level.

Episode 2 shows a unique structure built in London, with only 10 feet to spare on its property line everything is prefab and steel.

Episode 3 is a vertical city built in Shanghai. It is luxurious and has all anyone could ask for in any building.

The last episode is a building for billionaires, with a luxurious hotel on the lower floors and living quarters ranging from 6 to 100 million. We see the exacting specifications - huge pieces of rare marble and bathtubs nearing the half million mark.

This is an interesting series for those who are fascinated by cities, architecture and the techniques of building in cities, crating symbols of wealth and power.",1412380800,2,1403,4.682926829268292
