3830431,3,B00208GJ14,"First the ""pros"" of this DVD ...  excellent footage is included of the town (or lack thereof), the re-routed PA Route 61, the damage the fire continues to do, and the scenery around the area.  Watching the elderly mayor of Centralia and one of the last remaining residents gives a good feel for how attached some people were to the town and why they still will not leave.  The home movies from the 1960's that are briefly shown on the DVD add character and a real personality to the town that has a way of getting lost when you just read about the history of the town.

Now the ""cons"" of this DVD ...  I have two complaints.  First, the video is very shaky for extended periods of time.  For a professionally recorded and edited DVD, the camera operator(s) really should have used a tripod!  I found myself looking away from the screen a few times because of the shaky camerawork.  The second complaint is that the story of Centralia is told through the eyes of one of the very few remaining residents.  Nothing against him, mind you.  He did a good job of explaining his family roots and what makes him stay on in a town that no longer has any ownership of property.  However, to be honest about it -- I wanted to see more of a visual history of the town and the mine fire.  The producer(s)/writer(s) spent too much camera time on one person.  While his story is interesting and I am not knocking him, I would have enjoyed seeing a lot more fully-factual information in it.

Lastly, having read the book ""The Day the Earth Caved In"" as well as currently reading ""Unseen Danger"", the DVD missed a lot of key parts of the story:  how did the fire truly begin?  Who is Todd Domboski?  (he is shown in the DVD without an explanation of who he is and how he directly relates to the panic of 1981)  Also ...  who supported the town being kept intact?  Who was firebombed for supporting the town being relocated?  How did the residents end up fighting with each other over staying in the town or leaving?  What did the majority of the residents decide was best for the town?  What public officials were involved in the total bungling of the fire suppression projects?  Did the state and federal governments have an alternate motive for vacating the residents of the town?

All and all, the production of this DVD is not bad, but I would have liked to have seen a lot more history of the town and the fire, as well as more interviews with past and present residents.  The remaining resident they interviewed should have been a chapter on the DVD but not the main focus.  For $20.00+, I think the DVD should be marketed with a better description of what the disc actually has on it.  It is honestly mostly about one remaining resident, as well as the elderly mayor and two former residents.

If you're looking for a full ""history"" of the town and the mine fire, this DVD is NOT the place to start your quest for knowledge.  If you're familiar with the story already (as I was), then this DVD is worthy viewing.  $20.00+ for it is a bit pricey.  The DVD fails as a good history of the town and mine fire, but it does succeed in bringing people into the story of Centralia.  It helps you understand better that people made up Centralia, not just buildings and historic information.  I don't mean to knock or degrade this DVD, but 70 minutes of a small number of people and not a lot of history make $20.00 seem kind of steep for the DVD.

Thank you for reading this.",1248998400,29,3456,4.378930817610063

It's very inspiring to see John, the main character, and how dedicated he is to the upkeep of his hometown, and how he keeps hope in the face of everyone else's doubt. This is a great movie to help understand what really happened in Centralia.",1248652800,,371,4.23943661971831
3830433,5,B00208GJ14,"Very well done ! Excellent story !

I have lived in close proximity to Centralia my entire life. I have witnessed the heydays of this forgotten town during my childhood in the 1970s. I have visited often since its demise in the early 1980s, doing my best to photograh and document the tragic loss of a community's life for my own personal record.
This film brought tears and visceral emotion..realizing that what I had experienced as a ""local"" were merely just pictures and newspaper clippings. The true meaning of this film is of one man's hope..hope to preserve and save the true legacy of a small town and the people who once called it home. His continued unselfish,  un-rewarded efforts to keep what is left of his hometown alive.
I write this while listening to the DVD's soudtrack, feeling, once again, emotion.  Trying to understand the emotions of the residents of this town, past and current, and my own...wondering how this could happen. An entire town..full of life,love and spirit.. vanished.

This film not only can be important to people from this area in NE PA, it also can be enjoyed by anyone interested in the love of life, the undying determination of hope, and memories.",1247961600,7,1190,4.762135922330097

3830439,5,B00208GJ14,"""The Town that was"" is one of the most intriguing and sad ghost-town stories of the modern industrial age. In 1962 during a controlled  burn at a trash site in Centralia Pennsylvania, fire spread to the anthracite coal beds below, which have  lasted a half century. Because of the gases rising from the Earth, it turned Centralia into a ghost town. In a sense this is a true ghost town because most of the town has completely disappeared. All that is left now are bare vacant lots and eerie white steam coming up from the ground. However, a few shattered houses remain along with their eleven residents that refuse to leave. These individuals represent true love for the town, and still reminisce for a town that will never return.

After high concentrations of Carbon Dioxide was detected in people's homes along with major roads buckling from the steam coming from the ground, the state in the 1980s forced most of the residents out. A few diehard residents remain today. I guess the remaining soul of this town exists within these individuals. The film focus's on John Lokitis, who could be called the town's caretaker. He paints the remaining bench on the main road, unlocks the cemetery in the morning, and during Christmas puts up a few decorations. In the distance you see rows of empty foundations of buildings that once constituted the town.

The film cleverly juxtaposes old 8 millimeter film footage of the once vibrant town with the current barren surroundings.  You can see from the old town parade footage that this was a close nit town. Now all that is left are a few houses and empty lots, and in background there is steam constantly rising from the ground making it look like some prehistoric landscape. But this has not deterred the spirit of the remaining town folks, who stayed despite being told to leave. To these people this place will always be home. Interestingly enough some of the people that left long ago came back to this town to be buried. Maybe to them this is their true home as well.",1328140800,,2017,4.686440677966102
3830440,4,B00208GJ14,"This is a captivating movie, certainly for me. I drove through Centralia a number of times some years ago, both in the very early days of the fire when the town was essentially intact, and after it had become a smoking ghost zone with contorted roads and scary subduction zones. And virtually no people. I learned a lot about this largely unknown little town from this documentary. Nicely done.",1322870400,,394,4.72463768115942
3830441,5,B00208GJ14,"I have read 2 books on this tragedy so far - and watched this DVD.  The books tell more about the stupid political bickering that allowed this tragedy to happen - a fire that could have been easily put out in the beginning, allowed to grow slowly and destroy an entire town - and develop into something that make take billions to put out - and destroy more towns such as Mt. Carmel PA eventually.
  The DVD does need some more added features - the extra's are also a must to watch - but one extra that is needed is to document how the people were lied too about the health effects of CO2 poisoning - before the days of the internet.  People concerned about how they were suddenly feeling ill, as well as their family - had to drive to a library and look up the effects of Co2 poisoning - as the government was acting as if they had nothing to worry about - when furnaces wouldn't stay lit (pilot lights not having enough air to stay lit), people falling asleep and not being able to be easily awakened - sick, tired, etc.
  The missing part that is really needed though is with todays technology, can anything be done to rebuild Centralia in honor of the people who went through such hell for so many years, trying to get the government to quickly supply assistance to prevent this tragedy from developing. Today, can the fire be mapped by infrared and other means - then the mines filled in under Centralia and bring a few homes and businesses back? As one person stated in the DVD - I have no hometown to go back too - when we gather at the cemetery for our yearly celebration - we can't go to a restaurant nearby, or anyone's home - it would be so nice to bring back a few homes, and a few businesses.",1321401600,3,1704,4.243827160493828
3830442,3,B00208GJ14,"The Town that Was (Chris Perkel and George Roland, 2007)

I've been talking about Centralia a lot the past few weeks, not just as a side effect of seeing The Town that Was, and I'm finding that a lot of people I thought would be aware of it aren't. The perils of having grown up on the outskirts of coal country oneself, I guess; Centralia was a bedtime bogeyman story when you lived in Pittsburgh. So, perhaps, a small history lesson to ease you into this documentary.

Centralia, which is actually in east-central Pennsylvania, used to be a booming coal-mining town. In 1962, a fire started in a coal mine underneath the town. It has been burning ever since. No one knows how it started, though some hypotheses have been advanced over the years (Wikipedia reports on one or two). While it is not the longest-burning underground mine fire in America, nor the largest geographically, one could argue that it is the greatest mine-related disaster in American history; after all, it has, essentially, destroyed an entire borough over the past half-century; while some people still ""unofficially"" live in Centralia, eminent domain was claimed by the State of Pennsylvania in 1992. Even the United States Post Office revoked the city's zip code in 2002. Centralia, officially, no longer exists. (According to Wikipedia, as of 2010, only five homes remain in the borough.)

Again according to Wikipedia, there were eighteen people residing in Centralia, PA, in 2004, when The Town that Was was filmed (by the time of its release in 2007, that number had dwindled to nine). It is of the Errol Morris style of documentary filmmaking, in that the guys behind the camera mostly stay out of the way and simply let those residents talk about what life used to be like in the town and compare and contrast what it's like circa 2004. We get to see the formation of a ghost town, essentially, despite the efforts of the remaining residents to keep it functioning as a town. The strongest activist, if the term can be used in this context, for the continuing function of Centralia as a town is John Lokitis. (Not any more; Wiki reports he was evicted in the summer of 2009.) We spend a good deal of time with him over the course of the film. He's a likable enough guy, very salt-of-the-earth in a way that anyone who grew up in a coal town will identify with. We also drop in on a number of other remaining residents; the one who will stick with you the most, I'd warrant, is Todd Domboski, who as a kid in 1981 was a part of the incident that prompted the state to start relocating people (a sinkhole opened up under him in his family's backyard; only his brother saved him from falling into a tunnel filled with carbon monoxide and suffocating). His interview in the finished film is something else, but there's an extended interview clip with him in the DVD extras. It's worth watching.

I have a sneaking suspicion that, once the last of the residents are gone and the final planned event (a time capsule opening scheduled for 2016) has come and passed, that a government, be it county, state, or federal, will put a large fence around the entire area and make it vanish from the face of the earth. Twenty-five years after that, it'll be another Area 51 in the minds of conspiracy theorists. Which would probably make better use of the land than anyone else can, though some former residents still squabble over the mineral rights (a fact oddly absent from the film, given that it's fascinating, at least, again, if you grew up in/near coal country. I put it down to one of the co-directors being from Queens). This is probably a vertical-market film, but it's one worth watching if you're interested in the source material, or in how ghost towns get to be ghost towns. ***",1300233600,,3762,4.6441441441441444
3830443,5,B00208GJ14,"The ""town that was"" is Centralia, Pennsylvania.  It would be just like any other coal-mining town in the anthracite region of eastern Pennsylvania, except that in 1962, a fire that had been deliberately started in the town's trash dump ignited a coal seam just below the surface and started an underground inferno.  Today, 48 years later, the Centralia Mine Fire is still burning; and in the 1980's, after a 12-year-old boy almost fell to a fiery death when a subsidence suddenly opened up in his grandmother's backyard, the fire forced the evacuation and demolition of virtually all the homes and businesses in Centralia.  Today, Centralia is a real-life ghost town; one can see the cracked asphalt where the streets used to be, and yet there are no homes or businesses.  It is an eerie and forbidding landscape, and a sad true-life story.  The documentary ""The Town That Was"" does a skillful and effective job of telling the tragic story of Centralia.  The key informant here is John Lokitis, the youngest of a handful of holdouts who absolutely refused to evacuate.  Other informants include former town residents, authors like David DeKok (whose two books on Centralia remain essential accounts of the mine fire and its aftermath), scientists, and even the late U.S. Representative John Murtha.  Home movies and some old news footage capture what Centralia used to look like; the juxtaposition between old images of a thriving town of happy families and modern footage of the empty, smoking landscape of today is heartbreaking.  Some documentaries have too much voice-over narration; this one might have benefited from more of that kind of narration, especially in terms of explaining the bitter divisions that emerged in the town of Centralia between those who wanted to relocate for the safety of their families, and those who wanted to stay at any cost.  (DeKok's books tell this story well, as does Joan Quigley's ""The Day the Earth Caved In."")  Yet the images speak for themselves and have an undeniable power.  A powerful documentary, highly recommended.",1276041600,,2064,5.056047197640118

I was very moved by the extent of the situation created by a community's attempt to dispose of trash in a seemingly nature-friendly manner.  To recognize the cost to the residents of this small close-knit community is overwhelming.  Once again man is at logger-heads with nature.
