6305752,4,B00IZEATRM,"With any much-beloved story (and anything in the Bible comes under that heading), you're just never going to please the people who had already visualized for themselves. Leave them (with respect) to their thoughts, and move on.

Aronofsky has done it again, with a spectacular rendering of the classic story of redemption - this time, not just redemption of mankind, but of one man, too. Translation from book to movie always involves artistic decisions. Translation from a story you can read in ten minutes to a two-hour movie demands a lot of filling-in of missing detail, too, and there's plenty of that here. (Suspended animation for the menagerie - well, that solves a whole bunch of problems.) And the whole human experience - well, I haven't checked my King James translation of the Greek translation of the Aramaic lately, but I don't remember a lot of emphasis on that, and it really has to be there to make the story come to life. And yes, it's there. Add in the best the effect-meisters can manage, having practiced on a big bunch of recent disaster flicks, and it makes for a show that's well above average. And, if the familial tensions get amped up a bit, I can't complain too much. Have you ever spent a long car trip cooped up with teenagers, let alone a claustrophobic boat trip covering months? A few moments of high feeling are to be believed - and we don't even live in an era when we accept people like Abraham (or this Noah) having voices in their heads telling them to kill their family members.

Granted, this may have stretched the original text past its elastic limit, possibly to the yield point. But, when original means ""translation of a translation of a thousand years of oral tradition,"" or something even less solid, I can allow a fair bit of elasticity. Aronofsky's stop-animated interludes presented more of a stylistic leap than I could really follow. Outside of that, though, I found it a very workable imagining of the classic story. And, when you think about what movies have done lately to the Greek and Norse myths, this Semitic story got off lightly.

6305754,1,B00IZEATRM,"Horrible movie.  Russell Crowe is a great actor, but the director, writers and special effects are poor.  No where near a great block buster like Hobbit or Lord of the Rings.  Saw it at IMAX. I definitely will not be buying a dvd nor blu ray of this movie.  Once again, Hollywood does not make films for the general public ... they do what they want to do and the funding is endless.  I had a similar reaction to all the Kevin Costner movies this year.

Darren Aronofsky was quoted to have said ""It's a very hard line, as a filmmaker, to know when is too much. And I'm usually on the wrong side of it.""  Yes, I have to agree with Aronofsky ... he really stuck his foot in it this time.  loooool.

Darren was also quoted to have said ""To me, watching a movie is like going to an amusement park. My worst fear is making a film that people don't think is a good ride.""  Gee ... I think his worst fears were realized.  But, don't feel too bad for Aronofsky, he was also quoted to have said ""I try to live my life where I end up at a point where I have no regrets. So I try to choose the road that I have the most passion on because then you can never really blame yourself for making the wrong choices. You can always say you're following your passion.""  So ... Aronofsky makes movies and really does not care if the public likes it or not ... and he can live with this because he can hide behind his intolerant ""passion"".

6305756,1,B00IZEATRM,"Awful movie. Did Hollywood make this movie to give non-christians the idea that the Bible is full of fantasy garbage such as is depicted in this movie? This movie is total crap. I have never been tempted to leave a theater while watching a movie...until tonight.

This movie featured advanced cities (with metal piping and other modern-looking devices), ""angels"" that had been turned into rock-creatures (they reminded me of the Ents in the movie trilogy Lord of the Rings, only the special effects in this movie couldn't hold a candle to director Peter Jackson's work), villains wearing welding masks as they worked at their forges, a low-life criminal leader who managed to keep hidden on the Ark for nine months, and other really ridiculous ideas.

Don't waste your money on this. Wait until it comes out for free. Better yet, dedicate a few hours to cleaning your toilet because it will be time better spent.",1395964800,27,912,4.877419354838709
6305757,1,B00IZEATRM,"Quote from Paramount, ""The film is inspired by the story of Noah. While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values, and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide.""

So how can this movie be true to the essence when it never mentions the word God once? The Nephilim (fallen angels according to Enoch) play a large role in this movie even almost becoming the saviors of mankind.

Aronofsky admits that he himself is not religious, and advances the ""global warming"" theory using this movie. In fact, he called upon Rabbi Dennis, author of the ""Encyclopedia of Jewish Myth, Magic and Mysticism"" to help with the story which ended up with a Kabbalistic and Enochian foundation, not one from scripture.

One such detail is the exclusion of the window which God told Noah to make in the ark. Instead Aronofsky uses a magic gemstone to illuminate the arc, given to Noah by the watchers (fallen angels).

Really take a good look at this story before assuming it's a Biblical movie. If you think Hollywood is going to release an accurate telling of the Bible, think again.",1395964800,49,1152,4.688118811881188
6305758,2,B00IZEATRM,"Noah.  God.  The deluge to destroy the world and then start it anew.  A pair of every living creature housed within a vast ship made of ""gopher wood.""  Beyond the question of one's faith, it is hard to imagine a person not knowing this story or at least having a version of it in his or her head.  Here it is interpreted on film by director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler) as a mega-budget action/adventure spectacle and also as a meditation on, among other concerns, the environment and the concept of justice.  Russell Crowe is an able Noah:  ever a source of cinematic fury and grit, he can create this type of bearded monument to the macho and the mad with ease, though there is never a sense he is challenged despite the iconic nature of the role.  The overall result is ambitious and not without a certain objective interest in regard to its production and how it is received around the world, yet, as a film, as an intended entertainment, it is uneven and at times even unpleasant.

Changes to the story as presented in Genesis, or rather details and tensions inserted to turn it into a feature-length film, have generated furious debate.  In my opinion, as an atheist who finds the story of Noah intriguing without believing it to be true in any way, shape, or form, a few of the changes are positive and a few are negative.  The worst:  the conception and inclusion of angels turned stone giants named the Watchers, beings who aid Noah's construction and engage in a brutal fight sequence as the flood begins.  These computer-generated monster-protectors play as if they tramped their way out of second-rate deleted scenes from the Lord of the Rings or Pirates of the Caribbean franchises, and I could never invest in their involvement in the storyline.  A more rewarding alteration:  Tubal-Cain, a smith (descended from the first murderer) briefly mentioned in the Bible, is played by Ray Winstone as a self-proclaimed king who refuses to be stamped out by the Creator to whom the stoic Noah is so beholden, at least not without a bone-crushing, throat-slicing fight.  The way his desperate urge toward self-preservation manifests itself is riveting, as is the way he contends with others or seduces them to his side.

In general, aforementioned stone giants notwithstanding, this is a film which rouses in its large moments, but falls short in regard to more fundamental elements, including character development.  A scene in which Noah spins a campfire tale regarding God's creation of the universe results in a psychedelic time-lapse montage placing Adam and Eve within an evolutionary context, and the result is as gorgeous as it is provocative.  This is a bold and neat gambit.  Yet, on the other hand, consider Noah's sons, including Ham and Shem, and how thinly conceived they are.  They are important characters, yet there is not a single significant moment of interaction to reveal to the audience the ever-evolving dimension of love and resentment so often shared by brothers and sisters.  Portrayed by porcelain stud Douglas Booth, Shem in particular is a nonentity and cipher.  And so it goes with Noah the film:  amazing visuals and moments of rousing acting give way to hamstrung dramatic beats and underdeveloped characters and ideas.",1395964800,11,3259,4.894353369763206
6305759,4,B00IZEATRM,"""Noah"" (2014 release; 138 min.) brings to the big screen the tale of how Noah gets instructions from the Creator (through a vision/dream) to prepare for the end of times, and to build an arc carrying a male and female of each animal species on earth. along with his family consisting of his wife, 3 sons and a girl they have adopted along the way and raised as if own of their own. Along the way, we got to meet ""the wicked ones"" who are bent on storming the arc and taking it over. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: ""Noah"" is the latest ambitious film from writer-director Darren Aronofsky, who most recently delighted us with ""Black Swan"" but has also brought us other top notch movies like ""The Wrestler"", ""Requiem For A Dream"" and ""Pi"". Of the little that I know of the old testament's story, I was thinking to myself ""how is this going to take 2+ hours to play out?"", but Aronofsky has woven quite a few intricate moral dilemmas into the plot (which I won't detail further so as not to spoil anything). Second, the visuals of the movie are nothing short of stunning. When the arc is attacked by ""the wicked ones"" and defended by ""the Watchers"", it is a CGI dream in heaven. And when the flood arrives, it gets even better. Third, the movie has created some controversy for straying from/adding to the old testament's story (which is only 3 chapters in Genesis). To which I say: this is not a history lesson, or a religion class. This is a Hollywood movie trying to entertain you, and at that it surely succeeds. Fourth, there is a reason this movie is rated PG-13, as there are several disturbing (if brief) scenes in the movie. So please don't take your 5 or 6 yr. old to see this (as I saw one couple do when I saw the movie today--surprise, surprise, they ended up leaving early). Last, but not least, check out the excellent soundtrack, courtesy of Clint Mansell (whose has scored all of Aronofsky's movies). Patti SMith (accompanied by the Kronos Wuarted) sings ""Mercy Is"" over the movie's closing credits.

Bottom line: ""Noah"" is another ambitious movie from Aronofsky, and would we want it any other way? I thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. The movie opened today, and I went to see it at an early evening screening here in Cincinnati. It was playing at a mega-size theater, but the screening was not well attended, I'm afraid. I also notice that ""Noah"" is available on Amazon Instant Video, which really surprises me, but if you're going to see this, this is the kind of movie that begs to be screen on the big screen. ""Noah"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1395964800,3,2683,4.518518518518518
6305760,5,B00IZEATRM,"Human morality is brought to center stage in director Darren Aronofsky's ambitious epic Noah, which is a loose adaptation of the tale of Noah's Ark found in The Bible.  Already this movie has been dividing audiences with people of faith upset that it strays so far from the source material and atheists writing it off as ""religious garbage.""  Both sides are so caught up in their political agendas that they never stop to appreciate Noah for what it really is:  one of the best Hollywood epics I've seen in years.  People who are writing it off simply because it's loosely based on a Bible story need to just appreciate it as a well-made film from one of the more unique directors currently working.

First off, what you need to know up front about this movie is that it makes no attempt at being a ""historical"" epic.  This is a high-concept fantasy film loosely based on a Biblical tale.  Here mankind has created an industrial society and has pillaged to earth to the point that they're basically living in a post-apocalyptic setting. This is the evils of mankind taken to their most extreme to the point that our own planet is practically inhospitable.

""If you're a man you can kill.""  This quote from the film's antagonist sums up the moral and ideological questions at work in Aronofsky's interpretation of the Noah story.  It isn't simply a matter of basic right or wrong, but of human nature, and whether or not man can ever truly live in harmony with the creatures he co-inhabits the earth with.

While its deviations from religious scripture are certain to ruffle a few feathers I believe Noah falls in line with a tradition of storytellers taking classic tales and reinterpreting them for new audiences and with new meaning.  I feel these changes make the story even more relevant to our times, and help create a new struggle as the character of Noah is forced to question whether or not the human race is worth preserving at all.

All the Aronofsky tropes are here: a haunting musical score by Clint Mansell, trippy time lapses and character dreams/visions, with the most abstract and visually arresting one being Aronofsky's interpretation of the Adam & Eve story.  It's hard to describe it in words, but if you're at all familiar with his body of work you're going to be picking up on these things from the start.  Going in I was worried about how his style would translate to the source material, but he immediately washed those concerns away and I was hooked from beginning to end.

And of course when the flood finally comes Aronofsky gives us an honest to goodness, no holds barred, Wrath of the Almighty apocalypse!  We're talking the earth cracking open, gigantic geysers springing up, trees being uprooted, people climbing over each other trying desperately to survive--the works!  The chaos of this sequence mixed with intense human suffering I felt made it far more impactful than your typical Hollywood disaster picture as Aronofsky deftly utilizes camera and computer generated effects to create this cataclysm.

The characters of Noah could easily have been overwhelmed by Aronofsky's style and the visual effects, but every member of this cast holds their own.  Each character is given clearly defined motivations, and are performed believably, with Crowe being the standout.  His performance is enough to remind everyone why he is one of Hollywood's most sought after male leads nailing dramatic and physical demands of his role.

If you're a person of faith looking for an accurate representation of the Noah story you probably won't be very happy with this film.  Noah needs to be viewed as its own story built up from the skeleton of the Biblical tale.  If you don't believe in the events of Noah's Ark that would be mighty short sighted.  This movie uses a Biblical tale to create a high-concept fantasy, and should be accessible to all regardless of whether or not they believe in scripture.

I can honestly say that Noah is unlike any Hollywood epic or Biblical adaptation I've ever seen before.  Approaching this film with an open mind I believe there is a lot to enjoy about Noah.  It addresses universal questions about morality and man's place on earth, willing to show both the good, the bad, and the outright wicked.  Noah may be inspired by religious tales, but viewers shouldn't define the movie in those terms.  The film is a product of one Hollywood's best and should be appreciated as the work of art it is.",1395964800,15,4452,4.796854521625164
6305761,5,B00IZEATRM,"Ever since I was a kid, the story of Noah and the Great Flood has been a source of fascination.  And I'm not alone.  After all, it's the most-told story on the planet.  By a casual count, there are about 200 independent ""flood"" stories that are organic to cultures both modern and primitive.  Of course, Christianity, Islam and Judaism share the same core story.  But was there a cataclysmic event at the far edge of history that accounts for all these rather similar stories about one family and the seeds of life surviving a deluge brought on by angry gods?  And what does it mean?  We still call big natural catastrophes like floods or earthquakes ""acts of God"" even though few of us believe it to be literal  -- or do we?

The intensity of the story is so persistent numerous expeditions continue to search for the remains of Noah's ark on Turkey's Mt. Ararat, the region of the Biblical landing place.  During the 90s, I co-produced a segment of NBC's popular ""Unsolved Mysteries"" on the subject and shot footage around Ararat and interviewed eyewitnesses who saw something huge and manmade that has been preserved in the permanent ice cap of Greater Ararat.  I showed a special cut of this footage (RIDDLE OF ARARAT) at our local Short Film Festival a few years ago and was invited to show it in London.  Both screenings got wide attention and drew full houses.

What is it about this story that still resonates with us on such a deep level?

Darren Aronofsky has been working on his NOAH film for 15 years in one form or another.  He's known as a visualist and uncompromising filmmaker who loves stories about obsessive loners who are compulsively driven to the brink of madness in their quest to find God.  In NOAH, he has fashioned a $130 million epic film that reboots the Biblical myth with a bold look and modern sensibility.  The film has already raised the ire of some conservative religious groups that think they have the only interpretation of this scriptural disaster story.  They don't.  The power of myth is that it has relevance to each successive age and Aronofsky has delivered a film that's a fine fit for the 21st Century as well as a great return to the popular Biblical epics of 50 years ago.

The fine cast features Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly, Emma Watson and Ray Winstone.  Crowe is a wonderful Noah who may be fighting a private madness.  He is a dark and intense protagonist full of existential angst.  Who can't relate to that?  He does not exactly hear the voice of God, but get's the message of his mission and the impending disaster in an acid-like dream.  Anthony Hopkins is a scene stealing (and scenery-chewing) Methuselah who endorses his grandson's dream.  If there's an antagonist, it's Ray Winstone as Tubal-cain, an environmental raping leader of a rogue army who attempts to hi-jack the ark.  There's a terrific ten-minute battle sequence that looked like something out of Tolkien.

The production design and art direction throughout are superb and I liked the computer graphics that made the migration of the animals and the horror of the flood vivid and hyper real.

I hope this film makes connects with a global audience (and makes big bucks) so that other mythic and Biblical tales can be realized on the big screen with all the personal vision of artists like Aronofsky.  In many ways, he's the Kubrick of the 21st Century.

Forget the negative things you may have read or heard about NOAH.  Be assured, it is not sacrilegious, even though it may not be what you expect, it is an authentic retelling of this ubiquitous, enigmatic and powerful story.  For those conservative believers who are uncomfortable with the movie's theme of environmentalism and stewardship of the planet, it might be helpful to read the Biblical book of Revelation that specifically damns those who ""destroy the earth.""

But does NOAH have meaning?  Well, that's up to you.  For me, it's a potent reminder that we are one human family and the earth is our ark.  No matter how you look at it, we are truly all in the same boat.  But first and foremost, NOAH is a grand, big screen, spectacularly satisfying entertainment that dazzles the eye and provokes the mind.  What more can you ask for?

PS  If the ancient world and Biblical myths are of interest, you might consider reading the fascinating ""GOBEL TEPE Genesis of the odd"" by Andrew Collins.  It takes a look at the 10,000 (?) year old Turkish ""Temple of the Watchers"" that is linked in many ways to the Flood story in the real world.  There's so much we don't know about the outer edge of so-called written history.",1395964800,13,4602,4.685785536159601

6305772,4,B00IZEATRM,"Very artful and creative rendition of the story. Fills in the gaps in the biblical rendition by most original ways. One can discern that much thought went into the writing so as to mend the inconsistencies in the Hebraic account. Some examples of originality:

1. Even the fallen angels/watchers finally find a way to redeem themselves.
2. The blessing of Methusaleh literally saved the hope needed in the aftermath, very well done.
3. The horror of what Noah must have felt in his resignation to complete the task; his creeping madness actually added realism to the story
4. The relationship between Naamah and Noah was compelling; very powerful characters both.
5. Noah's cold and ruthless attitude toward the others and the resultant tension with Ham; hard to watch at times
6. Loved the character of Tubal-Cain; reminds us all of the balance we must keep with industry and the immature clinging to ideas of dominion

Others I cannot remember, but this film is worth watching twice so as to soak it all in.

Finally, the uber-tense scene on top of the boat with Noah, Ila and the knife:
Absolutely breathtaking, could not look away. Amazing performance throughout by Emma Watson.

If the complaining fundamentalists who give this film one star actually believe that the gaps in the biblical story really indicate nothing happened, then there is no help for them; they truly have no earthly clue how to interpret their own scripture, and are missing out on so much; they are walking talking DEAD PEOPLE.
Jesus literally wept for these ignorant people.

As has been widely observed, this is not a literal retelling of the Bible story so I'd definitely advise not going in with that mindset.  This movie is purposely set in a more timeless environment and you feel that it could happen at any era in the history of the world.  While the film has flaws, some head scratching moments and is a theologian's worst nightmare, I rate it high for originality and for the fact that it seems the filmmakers are trying to take the story seriously and preserve the themes and ask the questions that some people may have with the source material.  The flood scene, it's buildup and climax are all undeniably cool even if it is bit more ""action movie oriented"" then expected and the filmmaker (regardless of his spiritual beliefs or lack thereof) does an effective job of addressing the age old question in spirituality and religious practices and that is ""what is the line between justice and mercy?""  This pure love vs. fundamentalism approach makes for good drama and is thought provoking and the scene about half way through the movie in which Noah tells his family the story of creation had some of the most beautifully simple imagery I've seen in a movie in quite a while.

Ham and Japheth's wives, who joined them on the ark, are completely missing from the movie. Also, I don't even know what to say of the angels trapped in rock bodies that help Noah. :)  Finally, the pretty twisted and dark phase Noah goes through in this movie is a total 180 from what you learn about Noah in the Bible. So, I'll sum it up by saying that the writers of this movie's script took some rather large liberties when re-writing this Biblical tale.

My recommendation: If you are looking for a cinematic re-creation of the real story of Noah, take a pass on this movie. If, on the other hand, you already know the story of Noah, and can just take this as pure entertainment, setting aside the sometimes minor, other times rather odd diversions from the actual story of Noah, as found in the Bible, then this movie provides some decent fictional action, adventure, and drama, based rather loosely on the telling of Noah's story in the Bible.",1511913600,4,1107,4.416666666666667

6305860,4,B00IZEATRM,"If theres any filmmaker more controversial than Darren Aronofsky, Im not sure who it would be at this point. Interestingly enough, while most of his films are rated R (or higher, like the uncut Requiem for a Dream (2000)), I think Noah (2014) is the first time one of his films has been at the PG-13 rating. Since most of the controversy of his movies comes via the content that would make it R-rated, its interesting that the controversy with Noah is more along the lines of how Aronofsky filled in the gaps and created a dramatic narrative inside the Biblical story of Noah.

As is always the case with an Aronofsky film, Noah is a beautiful spectacle of filmmaking. Even if the landscapes of Iceland helped create this stunning setting, certain dream-like sequences and moments speak to the art that Aronofsky can evoke on the screen. The setting of the pre-flood world is believable, and most of the costumes and characters make sense, with the exception being the CGI-fueled fallen angels. Because the film is distinctly in the visual style of Aronofsky, there were a few artistic liberties taken with the story to create this contrast of good vs. evil.

I do find it interesting how a short story that comprises a small section of Genesis in the Bible was able to be filled out to a movie thats over 2-hours long. What helps piece together this narrative is the context of the Biblical story before this event. Drawing conclusions from what we know about the lineage as well as a number of Biblical specifics, the plot seems mostly plausible. That being said, there are a few facets to the story that contrasts with what the Bible says. Still, if it gets people to pick up a Bible and start reading, all the better.

A somewhat plausible plot with stunning visuals, I give Noah 4.0 stars out of 5.",1506124800,12,1803,4.628125

They go behind his back and conspire against the will of the Creator at every turn because they are, well... gals, and they know better than the Creator. They also get hysterical at every opportunity because, well... that's what acting gals do.

It's a misogynistic fictionalization that's just so completely and deliciously misdirected and over the top that I just loved it. You also get a long shot of Russell Crowe's butt to boot!

6305878,2,B00IZEATRM,"This movie is just another example of why Hollywood should veer away from epic tales and/or stories based on the bible. You have to keep a good balance with bible stories, especially ones that have been done to death like Noah: too close to the source material and lose box office cash because it seems like the movie was just made for a small group of Evangelicals, too many liberties with the source material trying to make it hyperrealistic and unless the film is really good, people will just think it's another action CGI fest that is ""barely"" based on the book.

Noah seems to grab aspects of both... in a bad way. It adds silliness in the story where Anthony Hopkins appears as a rather comical version of Methusaleh, toned down religiosity to try to appease broader amounts of people and then adds a dumb teenage love story to sell tickets. There are some good battles but the villains are simply unbelievable. Noah seems to act like some crazy old dude building a ship for no apparent reason and then suddenly two armies want to keep the boat for themselves? The villains just don't seem to have a strong enough desire to keep the ship other than the movie's script is so weak that they needed a token villain to try to add some action for the sake of it. You can take or leave the part where angels have the shape of rocks and walk around and speak to Noah.

The movie has some entertaining moments here and there. The movie is very silly due to the weak script (and yet it tries to take itself too seriously), but the action scenes are fun and the cinematography and costumes are a huge plus. Until Hollywood learns how to be ultra careful at writing coherent scripts and believable villains, it should steer away from epics that don't do very well in the box office and are panned by critics.",1499299200,,1804,4.463636363636364

For instance, Master and Commander--a truly stellar Russell Crowe vehicle--will live in my memory banks as Pippin on a Boat because it came out on the hobbity heels of Lord of the Rings. Every time he pops up on screen, I expect him to ask about second breakfast. In Sin City, I get to see what would have happened to Frodo had he not gone with the elves.
I had a similar experience with Noah. It is abysmally bad. I almost gave up on it until I had revelation of biblical proportions that I was looking at it all wrong, expecting it to be cohesive and make sense.

The world has become corrupt; God assigns Noah the task of sheltering the living creatures on an ark he constructs and takes refuge in with his family while raging waters wash over the earth, wiping out the doomed.  In this version, the righteous Noah seems to loose contact with God.  On a trip to find wives for his sons, he seems to have an epiphany: he is himself sinful, unworthy and corrupt, all are.  He relies on that concept in refusing to allow his family to 'be fruitful and multiply'. It appears at this point we are looking at a control freak whose response to doubt is punishment.  We might be reminded of Jacob's aborted sacrifice of Isaac as Noah struggles to kill his twin infant grandchildren.  Most religious leaders here who weighed in were anxious to support the film.  In many Islamic regions the film was prohibited on religious grounds as offensive.  This is a movie about a man who, at least through a sin of omission, seems to have blood on his hands.

The first half of the movie was pretty good. The rock people didn't seem historically plausible, but I found them entertaining. *Spoilers* What killed the story for me, though, was the way Noah turned into a murderous lunatic. First, leaving the poor girl Ham was trying to help to die, when he easily could have helped Ham pull her out of the trap, and next, -the nail in the coffin- with Noah basically saying, ""Ima kill my own gran'babies!"" And the movie directors clearly communicated that Noah had been told by God that he was to do so. That was where I was no longer able to suspend my disbelief. My extreme dislike for this guy wasn't soothed when he simply decided not to kill them. The damage was already done. And it wasn't like Abraham not quite killing Isaac. Noah actually thought that God wanted him to kill the baby girls, and he just wasn't able to, so he disobeyed God, at least according to the movie. God told Abraham to kill Isaac as a test, and then said, ""No, don't do it."" We're basically told that the only reason humanity exists, was because Noah rebelliously went against God's wishes.

Noah's character is made to look like a buffoon before they get on the Ark and during. There is much made up in opposition to what the Bible states, such as, when the family boarded the ark in this movie, only one of Noah's sons has a wife. Noah looks like a madman deducing that God killed everyone wit no intention of repopulating the earth and thereby threatening to kill his own grandchild when it is born on the Ark. Utter poppycock! Also, Biblically, the order of Noah's children is and always has been Shem, Ham and Japheth. This movie isn't the only thing that somehow makes Ham the youngest son as the bible says, its been perpetrated in our history for the same of justifying slavery, that Ham suddenly became the youngest son when Noah was drunk from wine and looked upon by ""his youngest son"" as the bible originally stated.",1482537600,,1188,4.50462962962963

6306022,3,B00IZEATRM,"I did not like this obviously Christian version of the story of the Flood.  Noah was a Righteous man--in other words, he definitely would NOT have tried to murder his own grand-daughters!  His sons were adults at the time of the flood, and newly married, and their wives went along with them.  Finally, it was just after the flood that Ham was cursed by Noah (who woke up from a drunken stupor to find his youngest son had castrated him, preventing any more sons to share the Earth with.)  For the sin Ham committed in the dark, he became dark as night.  This is not racist--this is the Jewish religion.  God did not curse Ham--all three sons of Noah were blessed by the Lord, in fact.  It was Noah's curse on his son when he discovered what Ham had done to him, that caused God to darken Ham's skin as punishment.  It was also a fact that on the Ark, there were no apes at all.  Apes didn't come about until AFTER the flood--at the Tower of Babel.  The Lord punished the sinners by the sins they committed at the Tower: the worst of the worst were turned into demons; those who acted like they didn't have a brain in their head were turned into apes ""You wish to behave like animals--fine, be ye animals!""  All the rest of us merely had our languages mixed up and were scattered.  Only Abraham was holy enough that he retained the Holy Language of Creation: Hebrew.  All of this knowledge comes from the Talmud and Midrash, which has been translated into English from Aramaic.",1482192000,,1477,4.405904059040591

6306029,5,B00IZEATRM,"I think it was a really good movie. Great acting, and I liked that it wasn't really ""religious"" . It has a good message of being responsible for our planet, as well as loving our neighbor.
But it is also a love story on more than one level, and at times it is a ""tear-jerker"".

It's family-friendly in my opinion (except for some violence obviously) but special effects are cool, and enough suspense, even if you're familiar with the story.

Lastly, I liked that some little-known details about the flood are presented, which prompted me to do some research, and really opened my eyes to things in the biblical account that I wasn't aware of.",1480636800,,642,4.573913043478261

The Ten Commandments had a bunch of additions, but it did not change the Biblical story. Where did these watchers come from? Why did two of Noah's sons not have wives? Why did Ham leave by himself. Why did Noah think he was chosen to be the last of mankind which would die off and the list goes on.",1480464000,,438,4.226190476190476
6306041,1,B00IZEATRM,"obviously written and directed by someone that has never read the Bible. I couldn't believe the inaccuracy of a movie supposedly about a well known biblical character. It is more a science fiction fumble. SPOILERS****** you have been warned....

Noah's father Enoch was killed in this movie, in the Bible Enoch was translated that he should not see death. Watchers are these giant rock people that are fallen angels which help Noah build the arc in around five years, it took Noah 120 years to build the arc, with only him and his family helping him, no mythical rock giants in the Bible. Noah preached to the people and was mocked and laughed at because until the flood it had never rained. In the movie people believe Noah when he speaks of flooding. God shut Noah his wife and his three sons and their wives in the arc when the rain started he couldn't open the door to let anyone in if he tried. In the movie he battled to keep people out, and ended up with a stow away. The inaccuracies in this movie are aweful but worse it misses the entire biblical lesson taught. If you are wanting a good Christian movie to teach your children about biblical characters don't buy this movie.",1480291200,,1184,4.506976744186047
6306042,2,B00IZEATRM,"It took me two attempts to watch this. The first time, I stopped when the fallen angels were introduced ... I was expecting and hoping for a story at least somewhat close to the familiar story I grew up hearing. Having Russell Crowe as Noah was another draw for me. But it lost all appeal for me when the rock creatures appeared.  I decided I'd try it again, on a day I was particularly bored.  I managed to get past the disparity of these absurd creatures, but it didn't take long for me to realize just how much worse it could get. I kept seeing things that were almost amateurish mistakes. The fabrics used in the women's' clothing was clearly machine woven, nowhere near the period's technology. In the attack scenes, the rushing hoards were using corrugated sheet metal as shields!  I can't swear to it, but I'm reasonably sure steel/metal leg-hold traps were not invented for another 1000 years or more. These are the kinds of disregard for credibility that suggest a severe budget shortage OR a film-school production by some under-educated junior high students! I could get by the distortions in the story itself, but the flagrant use of modern props in an ancient period is unforgiveable.  If I were Russell Crowe, I'd be ashamed to have my name associated with this production.  Embarrassing.",1480204800,5,1302,4.743362831858407

So this is a more action packed and fantastic flood story than presented by the Bible. Tension is established early and it sets those faithful to the Creator (rather than God?) apart from the rest. It follows a lot of loose themes along biblical lines.

To be a movie where the first 2/3rds are really boring they make every effort too make it not so boring.

Off of a hunch? Like if he truly believed the creator controls everything then how would Emma Watson magically become unbarren and have it not be by God's intervention.

The writers of Genesis incorporated those more ancient myths into their own tribal version starring Noah just as the monotheist Zoroaster myths were subsumed into Yahweh.  These myths were and are no different than the Greek and Roman pantheon, merely humans creating gods with the characteristics and qualities of humans. Those myths aren't true in the historical or scientific sense but are true as insight into the human nature.

The photography is grand, the characters well-developed, and the storyline is outstanding.

If they gave prizes for worst Bible movies, this one would be the champion of the world. I cringed for over an hour, making myself watch the entire movie, on the grounds that I didn't want to form an opinion without watching it first. We waited on the edge of our seats for Ham and Japheth to marry before entering the ark and it never happened. Then the only daughter-in-law Noah had, gave birth to twin girls. Were they going to be the wives? What are they implying.. Pedophilia? Of course they couldn't leave out the part when Noah got drunk and his son found him naked, even though their wasn't any grandson to curse. Finally the end of the movie came, do the makers of this movie even know what a rainbow looks like, I could have drawn and colored a rainbow freehand with crayons and it would have been an improvement.

6306498,4,B00IZEATRM,"Some interesting ideas had to be added to make a 2-hour movie out of 5 chapters of the Bible. I was amazed at how the writers stayed true to the creation account but then surprised when they deviated in other areas. For instance, Noah was over 500 years old when he fathered his 3 sons and started to build the arc. Lamech, his father, was still alive (he dies in the movie when Noah was about 10). The arc construction took about 100 years (he was 600 when God close the door) so his sons would have been much more mature. And they had wives. The movie only shows Shem getting a wife and the other 2 coming along as bachelors but we read in Gen 7:13 that the sons had three wives with them. Furthermore, in the movie, Ham left the group after the arc landed and went away alone. But from the Bible we know he fathered Canaan which became a large nation.
It was purely artistic license that they had a stowaway on the arc who Noah later fought after the arc ran aground. This was not necessary and likely conflicts with Gen 7:22-23 (even though there is wiggle room for a stowaway.

An interesting idea was that they put the animals into a deep sleep for the year long journey which would have solved some logistics of food and dung. But the better explanation was that Noah only had to take a male and female of each ""kind"" of land dwelling vertebrae so the actually number of animals on the arc is far less than what many imagine from their Sunday school days. With the dimension of the vessel given by God to Noah, there would have been ample room for all the animals needed plus a year supply of food for 8 humans and the animals.

And speaking of animals, the movie accurately portrayed Noah's line as vegetarians. In the garden, God had given all the fruit of the ground for man to eat. But after the flood, God instructed Noah his family to start eating meat as well.  ""Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything."" (Gen 9:3)

Another interesting idea was using the angelic beings (called the Watchers in the movie) to do the heavy lifting during the construction. These could easily be the referenced Nephilim on Genesis 6:4 since we aren't given any more information from the Bible (the real source). Of course, in the movie these creatures defended Noah's family and the arc from the invading humans who tried to storm the castle as the rains started.  In the Bible, Noah and his family entered the arc 7 days prior to the rain starting so there wasn't the epic battle scene portrayed in the movie. I think the creators to throw in a little ""Lord of the Rings"" style action to bolster ratings. It was exciting, but never happened.

I liked how the movie portrayed Noah when he realized that he and his family were just as evil as those on the outside. This we know is biblical for the Bible clearly says that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and that all deserve judgment and death. God saw Noah and his family as ""righteous"" not because they were good people or kept the law (which was given 1000 years later) but because he covered their sin. God will also cover the sins of all who come to faith in Christ.

Bottom line: I enjoyed the film but recommend people build their doctrine on the Bible and not a Hollywood rendering of it!",1472774400,,3333,4.34887459807074

6306657,4,B00IZEATRM,"This myth from genesis is less difficult to watch than I thought as an atheist. The visuals and action far surmount what I could have imagined for this simple tale I have heard many times since I was a small boy. It takes some optimism to see through the obvious insertion of appeals to intelligent design; however, there is fruit to be eaten from this film that will grant knowledge regardless of what each spectator may or may not believe.

First, it shows a wildly compassionate view for animals. It is surely a warning cry for all carnivores to abstain from eating flesh of any living beast. As a new vegan it felt like vindication for the struggle of eating a plant based diet. The scenes that draw parallels to the consumption of animals as a byproduct of the evil in men rang true to me. Ignoring the decimation of the planet and murder of animal life to the base desires of men was a clear message throughout the film. Eating animals is wrong: ""He gives us all we need,"" Noah states in the film. We do not need animals to live, therefor there will always be something inherently wrong with using them for any purpose that we can find an alternative to.

Secondly, I watched the film as if I was watching any epic fantasy. It is a fictional story with magic and monsters. None of it is to be taken as truth: Angels of light trapped in stone, a barren woman made fertile, a single seed giving birth to miraculous new life, stones of Prometheus cracking and fizzling magnesium fire, incense that grants sleep to all beasts--great and small. Noah demands the suspension of belief that any work of fiction requires for total enjoyment.

In conclusion, I liked the film for those two reasons. It was entertaining as a the anecdotal story I heard as a boy with the pleasing visual storytelling of a modern cinematic fantasy. I enjoyed the message of morphing duality in the moral of man. I enjoyed the quality of production of the film, good actors--acting well. I would recommend Noah to someone who may be intrigued by the concepts I mentioned or someone with two and a half hours to waste watching something in the background while they complete other tasks.",1471564800,,2162,4.56701030927835

So I was wondering what this movie was like since it was put out by a big picture company. Well even as a fantasy story,  this was very poorly written.

Taking a ""story"" (I would use the pharse ""a piece of history"" but that would create a whole different discussion) so familiar and applying very foreign interpretations to it was somewhat uncomfortable. It was like arriving home to find your home painted orange and black. It is still your home but it doesn't look like it.

I was pleasantly surprised, since conservative Christian organizations were not fans of this movie. It isn't a strict, literal interpretation of scripture. However, like most stories that come from books, people should compare it to the actual book.
It was interesting that, in this version, the animals slept during the voyage; that would definitely have made things easier! I can't imagine feeding, watering and cleaning up after all those animals for nearly a year.
The scenery after the flood was beautiful; the credits told me it was filmed in Iceland.

The acting is great, the special effects were top notch.  Great Job Aronofsky!  I was impressed, educated and entertained, just what I like to see in a movie.  I'm not going to debate the truths of the movie, as it is an interpretation, that may differ (not by much) from mine, but we are all allowed to have our own perspective on what we read and watch.  Again Rabbi Yonassan Gershom had so many great comments on the area's that were controversial, and raised deep perspectives on each, worth your read as a Christian to open you eyes.  Those who posted comments on his review that were Christians (like real Baptist Christian) remind me of they types of Christians that I strive not to be.  A Christian with a my way or the highway point of view.  I liked the human perspectives of this story, the ability to cast Noah as a real person, with doubts about his own goodness, and to look at just what Humans do, and how we destroy, take it to the next level with other writings and you can see even greater forces of wickedness in that day.

6306847,5,B00IZEATRM,"I just finished a study of the book of Genesis from Dallas Theological Seminary and watched an online seminar on the movie Noah. I would not have watched the movie if I had not taken the seminar. The take-away from the seminar was although the movie did not follow the Bible exactly and the director took artistic license, it was a very good movie if you did not have the expectation of it reflecting the Scriptures.  I really enjoyed the movie.  Having just studied Genesis, the events of that time were still on my mind.",1468800000,,522,4.484210526315789

6306852,1,B00IZEATRM,"There are some  interesting this in this loosely biblical-based film. But the mish-mash of a scarce amonut of source material with some apocryphal (pre-flood fallen angels) and many, many strange additional made-up central plot points (did I mention rock-encrusted fallen angel rock beasts?, Tubal-Cain being alive in the time of Noah, and successfully making his way onto the ark with the help of Noah's son Ham? No wives for all of Noah's sons? Noah going infanticide-minded on his grandchildren? Noah being an advocate and enforcer of a no-child policy and mankind's extermination? Noah and his family being vegetarian and the evil people being meat eaters?, etc.) makes it simply too weird and foreign to the source material for much of anyone to enjoy.

I could cut about half this film out on the cutting room floor and you would have a better movie, including some nice special effects and passable acting. Unfortunately, it would probably not make a lot of sense because major movie plot points required leaving simple things from the source material out of the film, like :""On that very day Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, together with his wife and the wives of his three sons, entered the ark.""",1468800000,,1215,4.921951219512195

However, the extreme stretch of truths from the Bible, are so far fetched to the degree you think its just another ""Transformers"" episode?!  Secondly, the anger within Noah's family, and a vengeful stowaway on the Ark are a serious turn off.  How they contrived this is beyond us.  We actually thought from the reputable cast, directors, producers, or writers, someone or more, might have stood up for the accuracy of numerous points?  I guess it leaves us to understand that none of them are Christian or even Jewish.  It could have been a superb production with today's cinematic technology, and perhaps a bit of understandable artistic license.

Animation concerning the snake in the Garden of Eden and stone creatures from the world of 50s monster movies pop up during the building of the ark sequences.  There are many battles and wicked human beings hiding out in the boat as the world finally floods.  There is teenage love on the arc and the rejected teenage suitor heading off at the end for a limitless summer elsewhere.  This film in no way touches John Huston's portrayal of Noah in The Bible, where the story is handled with some dignity and faithfulness to the scriptures.  Here we have violence and monsters and Jennifer Connolly telling her husband that she knows he is good and will not let God down even though he sees his children as more interested in life than God's word.

Wooden acting, little chemistry between characters, some of the worst animal CGI I've ever had the misfortune to see.  And yet again, Hollywood appears to have read a story, thought ""Hey, this is a great story, let's make a movie out of it!  But let's throw out all of these bits, just keep these couple of bits, and change up a lot of the characters!  Totally the same!  Now we'll make MILLIONS!""

I'm not Catholic any longer, but I was raised Catholic.  I know the story of the flood in the Bible.  I have studied comparative religions and I know lots of cultures have Flood legends.  But this movie kept only a few of the names, and the fact that there was a flood, and a big boat.  They added weird things that make no sense, and apparently had NO interest in using things that looked even old fashioned.  There are several shots with knives in people's hands.  These knives did not look even hand made.  They didn't look old, in fact, they looked like someone went down to the sporting goods store and bought a few mass produced knives.  Complete with serrations and machine marks and rivets in the handles.  Clothes were very obviously machine made, and there was no continuity with makeup, or even trying to cover up tan lines.

Total fail, and if I could give fewer than 1 star, you better believe that I would.

Some of the characters have the same names as those in the biblical story, and Noah builds an arc, stuffs it with animals, and there is flood.  Beyond that, this story has very little to do with the biblical account.  Accepting that this movie as just another work of fantasy/fiction having nothing to do with the biblical story is a good mindset to have to be able to try and enjoy this movie.  However, even with that perspective, this movie is terrible.  The story line makes no sense, is not believable (even for fantasy genre) leaving all kinds of bizarre things unexplained.  It isn't funny, the action is fairly poor, there isn't any chemistry between the characters, and the story line is ridiculous.  [SPOILERS FROM HERE ON] There are some fun things like guardians or giant rock creatures that help and defend Noah, but there are so many holes in the plot things don't really hold together well (and remember, you must realize the movie does not follow the bible story, so thinking it does becomes frustrating and misleading).  Methuselah is some magic warlock guy hanging out in a mountain on his own, a magic seed from the garden of eden creates a fountain of water and grows a forest in 5 minutes, the rock creatures are the ones that build the arc, the evil king can somehow climb up the side of the arc and chop a hole in it big enough to get in with a hatchet in about 5 minutes with flood waters pounding on him, but the structure of the arc is otherwise sound enough to house hordes of animals and withstand the pounding of intense flood waters.  The wicked king took a magic snake skin (supposedly from the snake in the garden of eden and passed down from Adam) from Noah's father when he killed him that seems to have some significance in passing on powers from one generation to another, but the real significance of it is never explained.  Ham gets it when he kills the evil king and then Noah uses it to bless the two baby girls at the end, but none of that really made any sense.  They can put all the animals into a coma-like sleep for the entirety of the movie by burning a concoction of incense and exposing it to them only once, but somehow all the humans are immune to this.  Noah insists on killing Ham's wife's baby if it is a girl because she would be capable of being a mother, but he doesn't seem to have a problem with his own wife, or Ham's wife (the pregnant one) who are also perfectly capable of being mothers.  On top of it all, and despite all these ""miracles"", Noah is totally clueless about what ""the creator"" wants him to do, and he determines he is supposed to save the animals and let the human race become extinct - but he really doesn't know for sure - but despite not knowing with certainty that he should end the human race, he is determined to kill two babies.

I am really disappointed that Anthony Hopkins and Russell Crow would participate in a charade like this.

Again, I can and WILL stomach a LOT of poetic license just to stimulate the brainwaves, but this is just garbage.  Noah is depicted as some sort of bumbling nut job with again, the WOMEN of his life providing the ONLY balance and sanity.  It is a perfect role for teen super chick/ super feminist Emma Watson and Jennifer Connolly.

6307030,3,B00IZEATRM,"Where do I even begin?

I watched this film because I was not finding anything on YouTube to watch, and I did not want to search around much for a good film. I had heard this was not that great, so I was not very eager to engage it.

Literally from the first few minutes of the film, I felt that it was very ""hokey."" Famous actors, probably a big budget, and I could think of low budget films with better starts. The visuals just looked chinsey and cheap.

Nonetheless, I kept watching. The ""rock people"" hit me at first like bizarre, tacky versions of the old ""Transformers,"" but after I let a little time pass I actually came to rather like them. Still, they did not seem Biblical at all, and entirely some creation of another mind. Thus while finding their presence highly ""fake,"" I came to like them.

The acting was certainly very good, and I have no qualms about that. If this had been a fiction story, it may have been more interesting, but still not as dynamic as it could have been. For example, almost right from the start their costumes seemed like someone had gone to the local thrift store and bought some used jeans and old shirts, turning them inside out, roughing them up a bit, and calling them ""period clothes.""

Noah also did not have any clear instructions except something he saw in a dream, and what looked like maybe a stuper from something his grandfather gave him to drink. But no clear instructions on what to build, how to build it, how big to make it, if humans should continue on, or not. This was aggravating, as it then made no sense how he knew what to do in regards to building the ark.

It was creative how they put the animals to sleep, and that I thought was unique, but then there was this whole theme running through the movie about how animals and the earth are more important than humans, and *Spoiler Alert* Noah almost kills his own grandchildren, thinking God does not want a world with humans.

I could not help but think of all those people out there who put ""save the whales"" before ""save the babies,"" and it just seemed very off.

Thankfully, alls well that ends well, and Noah got his act together about humanity, sans any direct instruction from God (so odd).

I found that throughout the movie I kept pausing it to go do other things, and while it had its interesting points, it was just nothing like it could have been.

There seems to be an agenda here, and I am not buying it. All in all, it may be worth a go if you are curious. But it is not the best movie ever.",1466294400,,2517,4.313559322033898

6307040,2,B00IZEATRM,"During the first five minutes it became clear, as I commented to my teens with whom I watched ""Noah"", that this would be an entirely fictional movie using Biblical characters and a Biblical story as an archetype, but with an entirely made-up plot and details. As the movie went on, I discovered how far the writers, producers and director (largely the same two people) would actually stray; nevertheless, I continued watching.

This movie is not the Biblical story of Noah; it's not even close. This movie is a combination between Transformers and Water World, with a little Mad Max thrown in for good measure, to accomplish some goal more in line with the ""dark and gritty"" trend. While I am a fan of the sci-fi genre, and may have loved this movie if the main character were named Bob or ""Garr of Um"" or something similarly fictional, building such a fictionalized story around revered and well known religious and (ostensibly) historical figures was jarring.

Most importantly, the changes to the personality of the main character bordered on sacrilegious. The changes to the more ""transformer-like"" characters (the identity of which I will not spoil for those actually interested in seeing this) could be interpreted as outright heresy. Those things made me cringe, and resulted in conversations with my kids about the falseness of what the movie was showing.

So I'm giving it two stars instead of one because I recognize that under different circumstances (i.e. were it not butchering a sacred account) I might have enjoyed it. That's about as generous as I can be with this movie.

Edit: After reading the review of Rabbi Yonassan Gershom, (search for it, it's very good), I can see where the author took some of his ideas, and why some of the details are the way the are. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that some of the details could have been addressed and topics introduced in ways that did not directly attack the character of a man that the Bible calls ""righteous"". Moreover, the depiction of the Nephilim was like dropping StarGate SG1 technology and concepts into The Ten Commandments; just too far out of place. So while the Rabbi's take is fascinating, and his background info makes me want to watch the movie again in that different context, it doesn't change the fact that Aronofsky threw far, far too much of his own imagination into the story, to the point where it bears jarringly little resemblance to the one most people are familiar with.

Spectacular, only in its manifest ridicule and hatred of God, His Word, and Religion and Church.

Anti-Catholic. That is to say, Anti-Christian. Satanic. Horrible. Dreadful. Wicked. Blasphemous. Heretical. Awful. Disgusting. Disturbing. Corruptive. Delusional. Insane. Psychopathic. Manipulative. Poisonous. Perverted. Debauched.

Fallen angels are depicted as giant rock creatures that help Noah build and defend against the hordes of wicked men that assault the Ark. As they fight off these men, and die, their spirits, trapped in the rocks, shoot straight up beyond the firmament into the heavens. As if returning home to God like Prodigal sons. God is portrayed as a maniac unworthy of the affections, let alone worship, of man.",1530144000,,738,5.63063063063063

John 8:44 King James Version (KJV)

Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
King James Version (KJV)

God will hold accountable for all your blasphemy against the True Word of God. You have corrupted and perverted His words. Greater is your punishment in hell for eternity. You are deceiving and lying to 7.5 Billion people of this world. Repent now before its too late for you.
