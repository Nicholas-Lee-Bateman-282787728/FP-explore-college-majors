The story begins at the home of Rhubarb Vaselino. He was sent for a sack of flour. On the way he stops at a bull fight ring, they advertise for amateurs. Men walk in but are carried out on a stretcher. Rhubarb enters, then the body of a bull comes flying out of the arena! Then another! We see a stretcher coming out - with a bull on it! The crowd carries Rhubarb on their shoulders. Then he meets sweet little Caramel. Later he brings home the dough. He divides the cash with his mom. [This was later copied by Abbot & Costello.] That night he sings to Caramel, and gives her pearls. They leave for Madrid and fame.

We see Filet de Sole, a famous and beautiful woman. Then Pavaloosky, the famous dancer. There is a comic dance. Pavaloosky falls into a fountain. Vaselino visits Filet de Sole, and stays. His wife and mother walk in, and hear his excuse. His life is ruined now. He prepares for the last bull fight of the season. This vicious bull has killed ten men, and that's some bull. [That cummerbund serves for protection.] Note the slicked-down hair. There is thunder and lightning - an ill omen? The crowd cheers for Vaselino, and he shows his skills. What happened to his sword? There is an attempted trick with ether that doesn't work. The crowd cheers. Pavaloosky throws her hat into the ring - and hits Vaselino. ""If you want to live long - and be happy - cut out the bull!""

The above can't describe the visual effects of this comedy. It seems like a parody of the famous movie ""Blood and Sand"". There was an audience for comedies that parodied dramatic movies.
