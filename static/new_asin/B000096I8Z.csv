The Sabu vs X Pac match is great and the bonus 3 way between Funk, Sandman and Dabu is awesome, they have a nice undercard with stars like the Blue Meanie amoung others.  The Public Enemy battle The Badd Brood Ian and Axl Rotten in one of Rocco Rocks last matches.  If you can get over Jasmin in a low rent wet T-Shirt contest you will like this.  I bought this DVD from the Blue Meanie myself when he was in COlumbia SC and him and Jasmin are good people, common give there promotion a chance!",1066780800,,564,4.1
