329360,5,6301415159,"I saw this film years ago and loved it.
Recently saw a remake (2016) which was painful to watch. Why, oh why, do some producers and or directors think they need to remake movies already made to perfection.
This 1945 movie won an Academy Award. The 2016 comes across as a ""B"" movie in acting and script quality.
Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire made this a beautiful, enchanting story. See only the classic 1945 version.",1508803200,,419,4.6

329420,5,6301415159,"I was looking for another movie and this one came into my mind.  It's a beautiful tale that lovingly expounds on how ""Love is blind!""  A must-have for your movie collect if you are a classic movie collector.  Nice to watch with the one you TRULY love.",1497312000,,251,4.297872340425532
329421,5,6301415159,"Like another reviewer, I watched this movie carefully especially because of Robert Young's work in it.  I admire him as an actor very much--the fact that he was a very handsome big star throughout the '30s and '40s in light comedies and film noir and ended up in TV, always a steady, dependable guy, never flashy or making headlines or demands--just a hardworking actor with a wife and family.  I guess that made him boring to some people.  No one has ever written his biography.  (Louis B. Mayer said, ""He has no sex appeal."")  For some reason he starred opposite all the top actresses, though, from Joan Crawford and Hedy Lamar to Lana Turner and dancer Eleanor Powell, etc., etc.  He was always charming, funny, astute, torn, or, occasionally, hardened by war or his convictions.  I love his movies.  He was a fine actor.

I never liked The Enchanted Cottage much for one simple reason--I could never get past the fact that Dorothy McGuire was supposed to be terribly homely.  She just wasn't!  I always watched a few minutes and shut it off.  But after reading up on Robert Young again and discovering this was his favorite movie because he considered the disfigurement of the characters a metaphor for his own debilitating shyness, which plagued him all his life (triggering his alcoholism and depression), and a larger message, of course, for all people--everyone has a handicap--I decided I must suspend my disbelief and bite the bullet.  I should have done so a long time ago, of course.  While I can't help but think, Oh, brother, the first time the little boy tells Herbert Marshall that Laura Pendleton is ""terrible homely"" (they couldn't use enough makeup to make her REALLY ugly), I got over it and got into the groove--especially when the servicemen at the canteen dance pass her by.  My imagination went to work.  What a painful experience that was!  I could BELIEVE she was physically ugly because of their reactions to her.  And so it went.

I was surprised that Dorothy McGuire had top billing over Robert Young; I felt it should have been shared.  While she was sensitive and fearful, understanding and loving, Robert Young was alternately confident and tortured, loving and KNOWING.  As good as she was, I felt it was his movie.

A few words should be said for Herbert Marshall and Mildred Natwick.  Herbert Marshall, who walked around with an artificial leg from the hip down since World War I, must have been thinking about disfigurement quite a bit throughout his stint in this movie, even though he played another kind of disabled character, the blind composer, who, Homer-like, told the lovers' story.  He had an incredible career, becoming a romantic leading man despite the loss of his leg, and remaining steadily employed as an actor of note for decades after.  He had the most beautiful voice and unflappable suave composure.  I try to detect a limp sometimes as he strides across a room in his many films, but I very seldom can.  They were so stoic in the old days about such things!  No one even knew about his leg--except maybe the people in the studio.  Mildred Natwick is an old battleaxe in this movie, but she is another old piece of bedrock of many movies, usually John Ford films.  I thought she was a great gruff old maid, a post for Dorothy McGuire to lean on, here, with a soft core well hidden.  Another of her solid performances.

All in all, The Enchanted Cottage IS a great story for all time.  Its romantic touches make us feel good, the story is enticing and sweet, leading to the message, which is important, today just as much as it was in the 1940s.  People and their emotions haven't changed.  That's why it's still a valid movie.",1496966400,,3681,4.689547581903276

I agree with another reviewer's comments about the damaged print that was used for the Warner Archive DVD of ""The Enchanted Cottage"".  For a long time, I have believed that many of these Warner Archive DVDs were made from the previous VHS tape versions.  This was especially evident when the ""Turner"" logos were present at the beginning of the MGM films.  This was NOT the case of ""The Enchanted Cottage"" since the print used was worn and damaged.  To view this film in the best available version, please buy the RKO Studio VHS tape!",1489536000,,649,4.699115044247788
329463,5,6301415159,"My Mom turned me onto this movie.  And then I turned my wife onto it.  And hopefully here, in this review, I can turn you onto it.  Basically, this is THE love story.  The one you watch on rainy nights.  The one you watch when you want to get out of your world and your troubles.  The one that reminds you that even the best of loves and experiences need to go deeper.  Highest recommendation.  This is one of those movies that few know about, but once they do, they want to tell the world about it.  If you've never heard about, but love impossible love stories that could still be in the realm of possibility, this is it.  Is there true magic to this story?  Not sure.  Probably not.  Unless, of course, you, like me, consider love to be magic unto itself.",1488844800,8,758,4.216783216783217

329465,5,6301415159,"I bought the movie after a rekindled admiration of the work of Robert Young, and the  comment on here about this being the only movie of his  he watched. I was not disappointed. It is a great movie, with a beautiful  message you will not find in the Hollywood movies they put out nowadays... It was a shame this movie was not in color as the scenery must have been spectacular in color. The love story had me in tears. The only problem I had was trying to convince myself that Dorothy McGuire was actually as homely as they tried to depict  her in the movie. I guess in Hollywood homely means average looking.  I would love to see a collection of the works of Robert Young as he was an A list star in my book, and especially shined when acting  with children.",1484179200,,759,4.236111111111111

329661,5,6301415159,"I stumbled across The Enchanted Cottage late one night on cable, and was mesmerized. It's one of those tiny treasures you unearth from the mass of well-known, big and splashy Golden Age of Hollywood titles we all know and love. Yes, it's quiet, sentimental, and old-fashioned, but it's a story that lingers even if you're not sure how much you liked it the first time around. The story focuses on 2 people, who for different reasons, feel isolated and unwanted, who see physical plainness and disfigurement as a mark of being unworthy or unlovable. Yet by some ""magic""--the enchantment of the cottage--they find beauty and love in each other. It's narrated by a blind pianist, almost as a fable, a fairy tale to remind us to look beyond the surface, and see the heart, even one that's breaking. The performances are good; occasionally feel a little ""stagey"" but that's not uncommon for the style and time of the film. Worth a look if you love old films, or a touch of ""something magic"" in your stories.

I was tickled to finally get a copy; this edition is well mastered and far clearer than the original broadcast version I saw since a lot of it is shot with soft edges, misty-ish lighting (and clearly limited soundstage), the picture can really deteriorate on broadcast. The DVD edition was really crisp without losing the original ""mood.""",1453248000,8,1342,4.759656652360515

I liked this movie a bunch. Not sure why this is supposed to be such a rare occurrence that when people fall in love their entire aura, persona, appearance completely changes in an instant. And this is not just for lovers, it also happens with close friends, professional and even casual acquaintances. Apologies folks but seeing beauty as a result of uplifting fine inner qualities is not a new concept or one to be forgiven.

Enchantment is a veritable experience and most are very grateful to feel the warm envelopment of these most elevated moments. For most of us they are transient, the lucky few, a lifetime. I have never lost hope of this message because it has occurred to me many many times. It is one of the reasons I live for. I have only seen one other film that addresses this concept, ""Winter's Tale"" with Colin Farrel. Also, an enjoyable fantasy love theme.

329792,5,6301415159,"The Enchanted Cottage is a movie I saw as a young person. The story has been in my head for more than 50-years and it did not disappoint. It is a story of an injured disfigured soldier returning from the war who moved into the cottage maintained by an older woman with memories of her own and with full knowledge of the magic rendered there. A young plain looking girl (how they made Dorothy Maguire homely is a fine example of Hollywood Magic) was called in to help the housekeeper. The hero is a dashing handsome man who first came to the cottage with his gorgeous fianc because they expected to later spend their his honeymoon in. He attempted to write their initials on the window where only true mates could carve their initials and he managed to break the diamond out her engagement ring instead. He was self absorbed with himself but knew he would be leaving soon for active duty overseas; the wedding would wait. When he returned from the ward he became a bitter but still self absorbed man; the house girl showed him kindness, care and understanding and the magic began.  Needless to say eventually they saw each other with different eyes; hence to him she was beautiful and she saw no scars on his face.

329925,5,6301415159,"""Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different beauty."" - David Hume, philosopher

The quote above captures the elegance and effervescence of ""The Enchanted Cottage"".

Two souls who have been bruised by life, find happiness together in ""The Enchanted Cottage"".

Laura (Dorothy McGuire), is a maid at the cottage, while engaged couple Oliver (Robert Young) and Beatrice (Hillary Brooke) plan on honeymooning there in a short while. John Hillgrove (Herbert Marshall) is a blind man whose vision is more than 20/20 when it comes to a person's true goodness. The cottage's caretaker, Mrs. Abigail Minnett (Mildred Natwick) has seen couples come and go to this little location of love.

Mrs. Minnett and Laura share a sisterhood of solitude, which only a lonely soul can comprehend. As in this short interaction between them from the film, both women hold that hollowness of a heart hoping for light:

Mrs. Abigail Minnett - Do you know what loneliness is, real loneliness?

Laura Pennington - Yes.

Mrs. Abigail Minnett - I thought you would.

From the outside, this cottage and the grounds surrounding it, may not have the appearance of a five-star hotel. But, it is what is seen through the eyes of affection and adoration that brings the decor to life.

As we all know, sometimes life doesn't go as planned. In this film, what may seem to be a tragedy; actually is a blessing in disguise.

Oliver returns to the cottage alone and he and Laura find they are kindred souls. More than just physical beauty is what they see in one another. It is that light inside of them, which brings out the glow on their surfaces.

Yet, the main character is not one flesh and bone; but it is a cottage of hopes and dreams. It proves that dreams of devotion never truly die; for they just hibernate among the snowflakes of Winter. It just takes a warm heart to change tears of isolation into tears of joy.

""The Enchanted Cottage"" is not just a place to visit. It is a state of mind that will remain in your heart, long after you watch this treasure.",1431907200,,2119,4.697297297297298

330059,5,6301415159,"One of the most touching films made in the 1940s, this ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" movie was gracefully and tenderly told in such a fashion that it made you believe an enchantment had truly taken place and had transformed the disfigurements of both Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire and left them both beautiful people as we come to see them as the movie progresses.  Throughout, both characters overcame barbs, looks of disgust and downright hatelfulness exhibited by members of a vain society that can only see external ""beauty"".  Although this movie was made in the 40s, the story holds true even today in that we live in a society that is fixated on having a perfect body, teeth, hair etc., and still judges a person by their outward appearance rather than any hidden inner beauty they may possess.  How sad.  In the end, we all will all be judged not by the way we look but by our deeds.",1416182400,,902,4.515337423312883

While contemporary tastes would probably dismiss it as too sentimental, I find that its modest sincerity & its belief in the transforming power of love is something this darker, uglier contemporary world sorely lacks. Robert Young & Dorothy Maguire are equally good in their roles as a disfigured pilot & a plain, even homely girl who initially believe that there's no welcoming place for such misfits ... until the ancient honeymoon cottage casts its spell over them. And of course the true spell is their growing love & compassion for one another. Herbert Marshall is equally good as the blind pianist & composer who has the inner sight necessary to see the two lonely lovers for their genuinely beautiful souls. The black-&-white cinematography & the lush score add considerably to the film's appeal, as does Mildred Natwick's supporting role as the long-bereaved housekeeper. I especially love the cottage window inscribed with the names of honeymoon couples over the past centuries. The film as a whole has a dreamlike, ethereal quality that you just don't find today -- most highly recommended!",1395100800,4,1158,5.1

I first came across this movie several years ago and I was completely captivated by this timeless tale of what it means to be truly in love and to see someone with not merely one's eyes, but one's heart.

The story centers on a lonely young woman, Laura Pennington (Dorothy McGuire) who is the epitome of a plain Jane, possessing nondescript looks and an unassuming manner, but who is gentle and kind. When a dashing young pilot, Oliver Bradford (Robert Young) comes to the cottage she is working at, she is immediately captivated by his looks and charming demeanor. Oliver has come with his fiancee and the pair are to be married soon, planning to spend their honeymoon at the remote cottage. Unfortunately, fate has other plans and Oliver soon finds himself called up to serve in the war, before he can even marry his fiancee.

Some time passes and Oliver returns to the cottage, this time by himself. Laura and the lady who owns the cottage find out that Oliver has been disfigured in the war and that he now prefers to be a recluse, shunning human companionship because he feels he has nothing to give. Over a period of time, both the scarred ex-pilot and lonely young woman find each other and discover what true love ultimately reveals.

It may seem like a melodramatic old-fashioned B&W romance, but the stellar acting by the main cast especially McGuire and Young's performances elevate this to great heights. There is much atmosphere in this classic movie that convinces viewers that we are truly watching something special and miraculous unfold. The other performance that deserves commendation is the one of the blind pianist John Hillgrove (Herbert Marshall), who through his sincere friendship with the couple is able to understand what is truly happening, and as he says, is able to see not with one's eyes, but feel with one's heart.

The one thing about this film that I am surprised nobody ever mentions is the suspension of disbelief required to see Dorothy McGuire as anything less than stunningly beautiful merely because she in not made up at all for her ""homely"" scenes.

The truth is she looks starkly gorgeous when she is supposedly ""homely"" !

Her stunning features, her symmetrical face, and hauntingly heavenly eyes are all there !

She is not at all ""homely"".  She is just not wearing make up !

I wonder if this film would have played as well if they used a really homely actress to play the part, and made the change more than just about putting on some standard Hollywood glam make up ?

The print we get to see is significantly affected by flecking, scratches and emulsion milkiness; at times it is just this side of watchable. The sound is good, but surely some cleaning and repair would have - should have - been possible before sending this into the digital age, with a not inconsiderable price tag.

The film is worth preservation. It is, undoubtedly, highly sentimental. Some would call it a tear-jerker, although I think its script is more intellectually demanding than the term would imply. The idea at the heart of the story is cleverly managed by the scenario-writers and by the director, John Cromwell. I won't spoil it for those who have never seen the film, but those who have liked 'The Ghost and Mrs Muir' or the more recent 'Always' may be expected to enjoy this film.

For me, at least, Robert Young's acting is something of a revelation. I associate him with light comedy, but he strikes just the right notes in this very different kind of role. The every reliable Herbert Marshall and Mildred Natwick also do good work. The star, however, is Dorothy McGuire. Perfectly cast, she gives a performance of rare sensitivity. This is a film about love for those who believe in it.",1325721600,15,1313,4.7043478260869565
330440,5,6301415159,"""The Enchanted Cottage"" is set in the English countryside during WWII. It is the tale of a man who had everything. . .; money, good looks, a gorgeous fiancee. When his plane crashed and he became facially disfigured, he lost it all. The hero is played by Robert Young, a war time favorite and Dorothy McGuire who portrays a woman with her own appearance problems.
The most interesting and perhaps important fact about this film, produced in 1945, was that it was used to help rehabilitate real life heroes who returned with disfigurements during WWII.
""The Enchanted Cottage"" uses a unique way to show that beauty is seen, not with the eyes, but with the heart. Today, our military who come back with horrific injuries,like JR Martinez, the recent winner of TV's Dancing with The Stars, might best benefit from the advice JR's mother gave him. She told her son, burned over 40% of his body, including his face , this: ""Whoever will be in your life will be there not because of what you look like but because of who you are.""

330442,5,6301415159,"I'm sure I cried the first time I saw this movie. It really cuts down to the essence of what true love is and speaks of the limitless ways you can love and that beauty and attractiveness are completely superficial in the eyes of the beholder.
The story is amazingly simple. An engaged couple (Robert Young and Hillary Brooke) check out a honeymoon cottage for lovers and decided rent it. The plain and frumpy owner/housekeeper (Mildred Natwick) speaks of the magical qualities of the cottage, but it is obvious right from the start that this is a couple that is probably not meant to be. As it turns out, the implication is truer than it appears. Young is called to war and returns scarred and broken. His mother(Spring Byington)is horrified by his appearance and doesn't miss a beat letting him know how dreadful he looks. The fiancee tries to be stoic about it all, but doesn't seem all that bothered by being released from her promise to marry. In the background is a housemaid (Dorothy McGuire) who is about as plain as you can get and is a shadow figure if ever there was one. Her plain appearance just adds to her own sadness and despair as she yearns to be beautiful and special.
After his return from the war, Young decides to escape the eyes of a prying and horrified society and rents the cottage. At the cottage, Young forms a friendship with a blind pianist/composer (the ever urbane Herbert Marshall) who realizes that when something is taken away sometimes something greaer is given. From that point a friendship and then love develops between Young and McGuire's characters. From there, I'm not giving any secrets away.
This is a minimalist film. Almost all the action occurs within the confines of this charming cottage that has a faux tudor sort of charm. Surprisingly, the make-up artists did a good job of ""plaining up"" Young and McGuire without making them look like they were in a Universal horror flick. Most of the unattractiveness came from the acting. The leads were just that good and convincing, as were the supporting actors. Definitely this film did wonders in terms of establishing Mildred Natwick as one of the great supporting character actresses in film.

330463,5,6301415159,"""The Enchanted Cottage"" is a film I have eagerly waited for on DVD. I had always hoped it might turn up in a Dorothy McGuire or Robert Young boxed set with lots of extras included. Unfortunately, these two deserving stars have never been awarded their own boxed sets and I doubt they ever will. It didn't really matter how it got released I just kept watching to see if it would turn up on DVD. The fact that it is on DVD-R isn't really an issue with me but the DVD does have some other problems I'll address later.

I remember discovering ""The Enchanted Cottage"" when it aired one afternoon on one of my local TV stations. I started watching it, not having any expectations, and before I knew it I was totally engrossed in the film. It was one of those classic movies that makes you feel like you have been on a wonderful journey where you have met special characters that you came to care about and when it's over you feel truly uplifted. I didn't see the film again until it was on the old AMC channel (when they used to show the RKO film library). I sat down wondering if the movie would have the same effect on me again (actually not expecting it to) and was happily surprised to find myself enjoying it every bit as much as I did the first time. I have since it enjoyed it a few times on TCM.

I don't want to get into a synopsis of the movie because other reviewers have already done so. What I want to mention is the quality of the actors in the film. I can't imagine ""The Enchanted Cottage"" having been half as good without the lead actors it has. Dorothy McGuire as the homely Laura Pennington really tugs at your heart strings. McGuire is a very underrated actress who, sadly, isn't as well remembered as some of her contemporaries. She could convey so much emotion through a look in her eyes or a simple facial expression. That's why, I am sure, she was selected to star in 1946s ""The Spiral Staircase"" where, as a mute, she had to do all her acting with her expressions. Robert Young is also outstanding as the disfigured pilot, Oliver Bradford. Young had a long film career but, like McGuire, isn't remembered for his film roles as much as his contemporaries, such as Jimmy Stewart or Henry Fonda. Young is best remembered as the congenial dad in the 1950s TV series ""Father Knows Best"". ""The Enchanted Cottage"" probably contains Young's best screen performance. The film also includes the versatile character actor Herbert Marshall as the blind composer John Hillgrove. Marshall is one of my favorite supporting players and he always gave great performances. Rounding out the cast are Mildred Natwick, Spring Byington and Hillary Brooke.

Now for the bad news. This Warner Archives release is one of the most disappointing DVDs I have ever purchased from a major studio. I was expecting a pristine clean transfer of the film. The print they used for this release is very battered with loads of film artifacts throughout. Warner usually does such a great job but they screwed up on this one.

I am giving the film five stars because I think all classic film lovers should see it but the poor print used only earns two stars. This wonderful movie deserves a much better release.",1291680000,10,3191,4.525129982668977

330465,5,6301415159,"The Enchanted Cottage is one of the most beautiful and fondly remembered films of the 1940's. John Cromwell's direction and a lovely score from Roy Webb give this sensitive and tender film about true love and real beauty the perfect atmosphere. Adapted from a Sir Arthur Pinero play by DeWitt Boden and Herman J. Mankiewicz, it is a film held close to the heart by all who have ever seen it.

It begins at a cocktail party as blind composer John (Herbert Marshall) awaits the arrival of Laura Pennington (Dorothy McGuire) and Oliver Bradford (Robert Young). As they wait, he relates their magical story of love which inspired his latest work. It revolves around a Noblemen's estate burned to the ground long ago, only a wing untouched by the flames. Over the centuries, only newlywed couples have stayed there, etching their names in a window. All who have stayed there have been happy, feeling something special at the cottage. According to Laura, the cottage is not haunted, but enchanted.

The chain of happy couples was broken by Mrs. Millet when her husband was killed in WWI, and only when Laura returns to the cottage to work as the maid does she begin to feel the place come to life again. For Laura, who is plain and homely, the cottage is a place to belong, somewhere she can live out her dreams of happiness on the inside, beneath her unexciting exterior.

Plans to rent the cottage are made by Oliver and his shallow fiance, but the second world war interrupts and the scarred and disfigured Oliver, shot down over Java, returns alone. John befriends the lonely Laura and the frightened and bitter Oliver, watching them find the beauty beneath the skin as the cottage works its magic once more and they begin to fall in love. When a miracle occurs and they are no longer plain or disfigured they cannot wait to tell their friends and family. To relate the chain of events which follow their decision would ruin the impact of the films moving message about love.

A cast which includes Spring Byington in support is stellar, with leads Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire giving extraordinarily sensitive performances. Their inner angst and loneliness, and their feelings of joy as they are transformed are brought forth in a tender and real manner. Finally available on DVD as part of the new Warner Archive Series, this Turner release gold box on VHS, which is the one I own, is an excellent quality print. Every couple should see this wonderful film together at least once, as a reminder that true love lets us see the more important and real beauty of the heart.",1274054400,2,2574,4.713333333333333

Albeit, not in a way the film truly deserves (restored and in pristine condition with a boat load of extras!), but this release far surpasses the lame and blurred pirate copies currently for sale on the Internet.  Using the same master as shown on TCM, as well as utilized for the 1990's laserdisc release, it is far from perfect.  In fact the film negative from which this has been mastered is badly in need of repair and restoration. But though flecked through out with dirt and stratches and lacking in clarity, density and contrast, the film still packs a wallop.

The disks are part of the media behemoth's new ""Archive Collection"" and are available now.  Amazon should offer them soon.  Meanwhile, eBay sellers are asking twice the retail price.

Dvd-r seems like an odd format for Time Warner to offer movies on, but it's actually not.  It all boils down to practicality, something Dorothy McGuire would beautifully understand.  Unlike pre-recorded video tapes, which have low fixed costs, dvd's have high fixed costs.  That's why we saw The Enchanted Cottage available on tape but not on dvd.  Now, thanks to dvd-r technology and its low fixed costs, less popular films can be released and earn a profit even when only a few thousand copies are sold.

Earlier this year, Time Warner announced that over the next 15 years, they'll offer everything in their vaults on dvd-r.  This includes tons of rare and obscure silent and early sound films.  While this is perhaps the best video news so far this century, I can't help but wish that The Enchanted Cottage were released on dvd instead of dvd-r, but that's like complaining about someone gifting me with gold instead of diamonds.

******************************
* UPDATE - February 11, 2010 *
******************************

Time Warner, in it's infinite wisdom, chose to release one of the best films ever made, The Enchanted Cottage, on dvd-r, not dvd.  The lifespan of dvd-r's is approximately 30 years, though sometimes dvd-r only last a couple of years.  Just google these two keywords:  ""dvd-r"" and ""longevity.""

Unlike regular dvd's, which are manufactured by physically pressing an image into them, dvd-r images are created by the chemicals on the disk, which physically react to a bright laser.  This photo-reactive chemical process yields a less stable product that continues to react to light, heat, and humidity throughout it's life.

For proper care, dvd-r's should be stored in the dark.  Keep away from heat.  Don't leave the dvd-rs in pause mode for extended periods. Despite what I've written above, dvd-rs may last many years and may even endure much abuse. However, don't be surprise if one day--poof!--the disk is no longer readable.  Before throwing it away, try playing it in another dvd players  Some players are better at reading damaged disks than others.  Just to be safe, it is advisable to create backup copies of the movie.

Having purchase several Enchanted Cottage dvds, I can attest to the fact that Time Warner is using grade b plastic keepcases and the paper inserts are printed on very thin paper that wrinkles easily.  I would guess the dvd-r blank is of similiar quality.  As for the video quality of the dvd-r, they work perfectly.  When I find time, I will read the tiny code near the center of the dvd-r hole so I can determine the make and brand of the dvd-r disk they are issuing our beloved film on.

And since it's on dvd-r, this opens the door for easy piracy.  Time Warner does not even seal the keep cases with cellophane.

So this release is definitely met with a mix of feelings.  We've waited so long, and this is all we get, a cheap dvd-r with no extras, in a grade-b keepcase and flimsy paper insert.  One thing good:  I'm pleased with the overall video image and sound quality.  It beats the vhs version, and it contains important scenes not seen on TCM or on vhs.

As for a BluRay release, don't count on it.  Time Warner didn't think The Enchanted Cottage would sell enough dvd's to even turn a profit.  They released The Enchanted Cottage only because of their new dvd program (for collectors) which will eventually see the release of their entire catalog.

The only chance of a regular dvd or BluRay release, as I see it, would be a box set or multi-movie disk, which probably won't happen.  In the meantime, protect your dvd-r.  Purchase extra copies.  Make backup copies, even to vhs.  Donate official copies to your public library.  Show the movie to your friends.  Dorothy McGuire Forever!",1260576000,20,4042,4.836496350364963

One of the best features of this film, to me, was listening to McGuire's soft, sweet feminine voice. It certainly went with the nice, compassionate character she played in this movie (""Laura Pennington"").

Robert Young, as ""Oliver Bradford,"" also is very good in here and Herbert Marshall is outstanding as the blind neighbor, ""Major John Hillgrove."" The annoying character was played by Spring Byington but her ""Violet Price"" role was small.

This is the story of a plain woman and a battle-scarred World War II pilot who meet at this cottage, fall in love, see each other as beautiful thinking that some mystical power at the cottage and transformed their faces, but in the end find out they haven't changed at all.

First, I hope this movie is never colorized--the atmosphere of the film, with the mysterious cottage on the ocean, is perfect in black and white (especially, as someone noted, on a rainy day).  Secondly, to the person who commented that this film is ripe for a remake, I hope that never happens either...too many classic films have been butchered by remakes (ie ""An Affair to Remember,"" the Annette Bening version).  I just have one quibble with the film, and that is that I don't think Dorothy McGuire's character Laura is all that ""awful homely,"" to quote the little boy in the film.  Mostly she just needs a good eyebrow waxing!  Also,Robert Young is supposed to be so hideously disfigured when all he has is one scar on his cheek.  The scene at the dance, when Laura is the only woman left available to dance and men are approaching her and then turning away in seeming horror, would have been more credible had she truly been ugly.",1194566400,6,1115,4.658163265306122

330480,5,6301415159,"This beautiful film remains a sentimental classic and has retained its power in its exploration of love & beauty through the eyes of the beholder.

Dorothy McGuire portrays the plain and sensitive Laura Pennington, a woman seemingly destined to be an old maid, where love is only something that can be experienced or observed in others. She comes to work at an old cottage at the edge of town, an enchanted cottage, so-named from her childhood. The cottage has a past, and that is any couple spending their honeymoon there, will continue to fall in love for the rest of their days. As is tradition, couples etch their names on a particular window, some date back to the early eighteenth century. As the legend goes, the home is a place of love, beauty and magic.

Oliver Bradford, (Robert Young) arrives one day with his fiance, falling in love with the house, and paying the future rent to spend their honeymoon. The war breaks out, and Bradford returns from the war emotionally scarred and physically debilitated. He refuses to marry his fiance, and seeks solace in the cottage. It is here that the two lost souls, Laura and Oliver, more out of mutual loneliness and sympathy, decide to get married. With this decision, however, their sad world begins to drastically change.

We see the couple through the eyes of each other, to find that they have miraculously transformed; Laura is no more that homely figure but an incredibly beautiful woman; through the eyes of Laura, we see Oliver's scars have disappeared, appearing now as the handsome man he once was before the war. Can this be true? Can others, too, see their transformation?

Their two closest friends, sensitive to this miracle, refuse to break the spell by telling the couple that their beauty can only be perceived through their own eyes. However, a visit from Oliver's family disrupts their bliss, and reality comes crashing in...

Despite the couple's perceived ugliness, will they remain in love?

This is a beautiful film about love and the nature of beauty. It is an old cliche that those in love see the person they  love much differently to everyone else. As the old woman, the owner of the cottage says at the end of the film, ""If my old husband rose from the grave and walked in this house, he would say I was the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. And he would be right.""

Enchanted Cottage is a wonderful film making one appreciate the mysterious ways of love and beauty.",1145923200,20,2452,4.712616822429907

A timeless classic with classic stars such as Dorothy Maguire,Robert  Young, Mildred Natwick & Herbert Marshall.

330484,5,6301415159,"The Enchanted Cottage is one of the most beautiful and fondly remembered films of the 1940's. John Cromwell's direction and a lovely score from Roy Webb give this sensitive and tender film about true love and real beauty the perfect atmosphere. Adapted from a Sir Arthur Pinero play by DeWitt Boden and Herman J. Mankiewicz, it is a film held close to the heart by all who have ever seen it.

It begins at a cocktail party as blind composer John (Herbert Marshall) awaits the arrival of Laura Pennington (Dorothy McGuire) and Oliver Bradford (Robert Young). As they wait, he relates their magical story of love which inspired his latest work. It revolves around a Noblemen's estate burned to the ground long ago, only a wing untouched by the flames. Over the centuries, only newlywed couples have stayed there, etching their names in a window. All who have stayed there have been happy, feeling something special at the cottage. According to Laura, the cottage is not haunted, but enchanted.

The chain of happy couples was broken by Mrs. Millet when her husband was killed in WWI, and only when Laura returns to the cottage to work as the maid does she begin to feel the place come to life again. For Laura, who is plain and homely, the cottage is a place to belong, somewhere she can live out her dreams of happiness on the inside, beneath her unexciting exterior.

Plans to rent the cottage are made by Oliver and his shallow fiance, but the second world war interrupts and the scarred and disfigured Oliver, shot down over Java, returns alone. John befriends the lonely Laura and the frightened and bitter Oliver, watching them find the beauty beneath the skin as the cottage works its magic once more and they begin to fall in love. When a miracle occurs and they are no longer plain or disfigured they cannot wait to tell their friends and family. To relate the chain of events which follow their decision would ruin the impact of the films moving message about love.

A cast which includes Spring Byington in support is stellar, with leads Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire giving extraordinarily sensitive performances. Their inner angst and loneliness, and their feelings of joy as they are transformed are brought forth in a tender and real manner. Every couple should see this wonderful film together at least once, as a reminder that true love lets us see the more important and real beauty of the heart.",1111881600,31,2415,4.742857142857143

330489,5,6301415159,"This unforgettable film is for lovers of love stories. THE ENCHANTED COTTAGE contains the message that true love is etched in the human heart and beauty is indeed in the eye of the beholder. Young is an embittered, suicidal and facially disfigured WWI veteran who meets McGuire, a girl so plain that no one would look at her twice. They eventually marry and move into a secluded cottage which is enchanted by the love found within its walls by its previous occupants over the years: it is a Honeymoon cottage of which Natwick knows to contain a legendary spell. Slowly and miraculously, through their love for each other, the couple find each-other immensely attractive to each other: Young has regained his youthful handsomeness and McGuire is blossomed into a great beauty. The film's theme of love's triumph over adversity was cruelly attacked by many critics in 1945, but the story is beautifully handled, written and tastefully acted. Young and McGuire underplay their roles which would easily have been labled histrionic in less capable hands. In supporting roles, Mildred Natwick and Herbert Marshall are fine. First filmed as the silent FOREVER in 1924 with Richard Barthelmess and May McAvoy, this was Robert Young's personal favourite of all his movies.",1030320000,193,1263,5.076923076923077
330500,5,6301415159,"I can't say enough about this film.  It is absolutely outstanding with fantastic acting by Robert Young and Dorothy McGuire.  I taped it off television years ago and was absolutely mesmerized the first time I watched it.  It continues to have an impact on me each time I see it.  It's a story about beauty being in the eye of the beholder and shatters the idea that beauty is only in outward appearance.  Kindness is presented as a most important virtue.  It is suspenseful in parts and the nature of the cottage's enchantment is not revealed until the end of the movie.  Not a coincidence that the couple's best friend is a blind man who truly sees them as they are.  It's a nice romantic movie.  Who could ever replace Robert Young?  Too bad it's not presently available on DVD or at least more readily available on VHS.  I also wonder if it was ever colourized.  Oh yeah, it is in B & W, but you don't really notice that while watching it as it is so interesting.

Feb. 2005 - I'm editing this review because I just found out that there is a cut and uncut release of the video.  I recently purchased a copy of the 1972 release and found out that it is shorter than the one I taped off TV.  This one is 78 minutes and two scenes from the beginning of the movie, when Oliver tries to commit suicide and when Laura goes to the party and no one will dance with her, were cut.  They are probably the most depressing parts in the movie, but should have been included.  *The uncut version is 92 minutes.*  I am editing this because I am concerned that some sellers are selling the cut version for very high prices.  So, let the buyer beware.  Let's hope the DVD is released before not too long, and that the whole movie is included.  I'm sorry I didn't realize this earlier.",1021507200,131,1770,4.303030303030303

And by that great actress you'll recognize - Mildred Natwick as the owner of the ""Enchanted Cottage"". Although Spring Byington is wasted in a minor role as Young's mother, it is none the less good to see her. This movie is ripe for a re-make. I just hope that if it is remade that it is not updated. Part of the allure of the film is the time period in which it takes place. This film is also a good example of how black & white film can enhance a story and move it along. It's a shame that not many of today's film makers are brave enough to use black & white. Or maybe, brave is not the word - let's substitute ""skilled enough"".
