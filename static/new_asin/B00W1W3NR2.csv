7114508,2,B00W1W3NR2,"A large meteor strikes a nuclear reactor on the Eastern seaboard, and creates a nuclear winter. A group of preppers live underground in a bunker for 10 years and don't seem to age. When the machinery messes up, Melissa King (Holly Deveaux) leads a group topside to fix the problem, but they end up in an old west looking town fighting mutants with florescent green contacts.

First off the science is all messed up. Even if a meteor hit a reactor, the radiation would be local. Iodine pills do NOT protect you from radiation. They saturate your thyroid to prevent radioactive iodine isotopes from seeking your thyroid. 10 years later the iodine has decayed away. The pills would be useless.

The acting was as bad as the science. Holly Deveaux as the tough leader of the group was funny. The hand to hand fight choreography was choppy and silly.

Guide: SyFy film. No swearing. Near  sex. No nudity. Woman in bra teaser..",1433548800,5,921,4.666666666666667

7114510,4,B00W1W3NR2,"This is better than most SyFy movies, but still B class! The plot: Large meteor hits Three Mile Island. Doomsday preppers are ready: have an old military silo stocked with military equipment, food drugs, water and a power source. Ten years later, power source is on the blink. Must send untrained amature preppers outside to fix the problem, but they are equipped with good military weapons and gear. Preppers meet mutants and the battle to survive begins. Now, there are two types of radiation mutants, both deadly, who will kill each other as well as preppers! So that makes things a bit interesting, especially when the one type are normal humans in daytime, but mutants at night. The other are mutants all the time with green blood and bright green eyes. So we pit untrained preppers who haven't been outside their silo for 10 years vs mutants who have survived everything in the real world for the past 10 years! The few cgi effects were fair at best. Over all the movie was done way better than I expected. Think Z Nation without Zombies and the humor. The mutants were not stupid, and were hard to kill. The 12 Ga. shotgun worked quite well. Anyway, this movie was entertaining and enjoyable to watch. At spots I laughed out loud, but not due to humor, just strange happenings. I give it 3.75 stars.",1432598400,6,1306,4.633620689655173

8711845,5,B00W1W3NR2,So bad in every way possible that it's entertaining to watch.  Felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live skit.  Unbelievable storyline creating more entertainment.  So many corny scenes.  I'd watch the movie again just to see what unintentional silliness I missed the first time.  Five stars because it's so bad that it's good.,1461715200,,332,4.963636363636364
8711846,3,B00W1W3NR2,"Not the best, certainly not the worst. Reminds me of an early syfy network production. Entertaining.",1445817600,,100,5.3125
8711847,4,B00W1W3NR2,"I really liked this movie; since I am a post-nuke type movie bluff.  This movie gave me everything that I wanted; A Disaster, people surviving under ground to come out of their bucker to a new world.",1436832000,,199,4.378378378378378
8711848,3,B00W1W3NR2,Good movie all in all. The story and plot had quite a few holes in it. For being a fairly low budget movie it was OK. I don't think I'd buy it on DVD or watch it again but it was ok.,1436745600,,182,3.357142857142857
8711849,5,B00W1W3NR2,I actually really like this movie. I mean you the mutants were pretty cheesy but otherwise I like it. Only thing that irked me is rolling with a 240B with no ammo. And the guy fired a burst of a single shot grenade launcher. But it's ok can't be perfect.,1435881600,,254,4.1
