*Plot analyzed*

A Monster with a Thousand Heads (2015) may find extreme resonance with the decent people who have had to deal with the intimidating web of useless bureaucracy that entangles most, if not all, governments or corporations.  All bureaucracies tend to put real people at the wayside, concentrating on extending their profit margin or influence.  They are virtual laws onto themselves.  In fact, all corporations have a ""bean counter"" (a person involved in financial decisions, and who is usually reluctant to spend any money or pay out to those in need.) in their departments.

A Monster with a Thousand Heads opens up with a dark room and an ailing person.  I did not read the synopsis of the film, thus it was a mystery to me what was going on and quite interesting to watch how the film commenced.  I did not know if it was a documentary or a drama.  An ambulance is called and a family wakes up with evident stress upon their person.  It turns out that a wife has been taking care of her infirm husband.  The ambulance technician, or some caseworker, tells her that he needs immediate care.

She attempts to go to the corporate headquarters of a medical insurance to speak with a doctor in charge of her case, and she waits, and waits, and no one seems to really care.  Finally, she takes matters into her own hands, grabbing the annoying phone secretary and asking who is the man in charge of her case.  With her son, who is a punk rocker (he has a 1980's haircut, close-cropped in front, with a long tail in back, think Dave Dictor from the punk rock band MDC and he's a fun character and an accessory to his mother's ""crime""), she uses a gun to find those involved with the decisions of denying her husband the necessary aid he needs to stay alive.  Someone at the private recreation club does get shot while trying to wrest the gun from the mother and they all are on the lam (running away from the law).  They travel through the city, intimidating more corporate lawyers or their smug accomplices.  Most of which are at private recreation clubs, or privately guarded expensive houses.

The film itself was short, clocking in at around one hour and ten minutes, but still, it's a nice little statement of anarchy against the rich and powerful corporations that deny us our lives.  It was filmed in Mexico, so it's nice to see an independent foreign film of some substance.  Music Box Films put it out, and they do some lovely independent films of all types.
