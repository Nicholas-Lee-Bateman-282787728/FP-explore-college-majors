51254,5,0783226608,"HALF BAKED

Still to this day I love this movie, I remember when it was first released and it is still as good now as it was then. Sure this movie is not for every one but for those who get it they know it is a classic. I remember this was one of the famous summer movies we had going one year. Se each year we pick a flick that we will watch all summer, not every day or anything but you get the idea. There have been various classics that have been our summer flick but this is one of the funniest.

The film follows a group of slackers who like nothing more than to smoke, and they smoke a lot. One day they have a nice little smoke session and send one of them out to the store to get some food, or how do you say, munchies. That is what they had so they needed the snacks so off one of them go. After he gets the food he meets a horse on the streets, I know what you are thinking but no it was not an illusion, it was a real horse. So he feeds the horse all of his food including chocolates and the horse dies. Turns out, not only was the horse a diabetic but he was also a police horse, so off to jail Kenny goes.

So the rest of the film his friends are trying to get him out and what an idea they have. One of them works at a hospital and has access to legal weed, so they decide to sell that on the streets. The only problem is the local big wig drug dealer does not appreciate the new competition, and one of them has a girlfriend that hates drug dealers named Mary Jane Potman [some name right]. Oh my, the things you will do for your friends, gotta love it.

Dave Chappelle is very much a genius and this film was an early sign of that since not only did he star but he was a writer. There are various dumb but laugh out loud moments here, if you don't mind drug humor this is a movie for you. All the actors are excellent in this film especially the group of friends. Chappelle, Guillermo Daz, Jim Breuer, and Harland Williams are one of the best on screen group of friends of all time. Of course this movie would not be complete without cameos from people like Tommy Chong, Snoop Dogg and many others. This is not a film for everybody but it is a very funny movie, watch with a group of friends and have a good time, we do.",1303948800,,2237,3.931567328918322

Everyone in the film (especially Chappelle, Breuer, and Diaz) really knows how to make the audience laugh. Numerous scenes are very memorable. The psychedelic scenes are just wild.

51285,5,0783226608,"I'm not giving this movie a five star rating because it's a good movie in general. You'd have to be stoned to think it was a good movie. I mean, this movie was probably written in 2 hours, filmed in 2 days, on a budget of $500, most of which went to cheetos and orange fizzy drink. Ironically, that's probably what it takes to make a hilarious stoner movie, which is exactly what 'half-baked' is.

You probably have to be, or have been at one time, a weed smoker to fully comprehend why this movie is funny. I may or may not have indulged a little myself once, so I may or may not have found this movie absolutely laugh out loud hilarious. For the non weed-smokers, (myself included, of course) there's still plenty of funny non-drug related comedy to keep you (us) entertained. However, don't believe all of the stuff you see these guys doing when high. Pot does not make you (so I've been told) feel like you can fly around.

This film features some great physical comedy (You just have to see Dave's reaction when he picks up the Marijuana brick for the scientist) some oft repeated lines ('he had sex with my momma! Why?') and a host of cameos (Jon Stewart, Bob Saget, Willie Nelson, Stephen Balwin, to name a few). Half-Baked is a light-hearted piece of stoner theater that won't really offend anyone outside of the hardcore anti-drug crowd. The cheetos await...",1222128000,2,1367,4.530364372469635
51286,4,0783226608,"The first time I ever saw this film was about 3 or 4 years ago.  I had heard many numerous references to this film, but never really got around to watching this film.  One day, in the BX, I saw this and decided to pick it up.  The movie itself is pretty good.  It has a decent storyline and some pretty good cameo's to make it a notch above the current dime a dozen mainstream movie out there.  (Meet the Spartans, The Comebacks, etc) My main gripe about this movie is it seemed too short and it went into the storyline rather quickly.  If it were any other way though, it probably wouldn't be the movie it is now, and it would run the risk of being drawn out and over done.  The storyline, as we all know, is about 4 people who live together, one works at a music store, one is a custodian, or a janitor... one works at a fast food joint, and one is a kindergarten teacher, which scares me because he's a weedhead and all, but he was doing the best out of all of them, AND the guy on the couch until he went to grab munchies, fed a horse, and not just ANY horse- he was an officer of the law!  And ended up in prison.  They raise money to bail Kenny out of jail, where Thurgood meets Mary Jane on one of their visits.  Ultimately,  They fall in love and he kicks the habit.  Half Baked in a nutshell.  This movie is memorable, and the characters and the lines from the movie are good, but not great.  If you can remember the scenes and the lines and laugh along with the movie, cool.  This movie is a little nostalgic for me and always brings me a laugh when I need it.  So, when I need to get lifted, I look no further.  Hope this review helps you.",1216512000,,1650,4.027692307692308

51288,2,0783226608,"Half-baked always seemed to me to be a movie about weed, by people who know nothing about weed.  I know it is a movie and it is fictional but hallucinating that you are flying from smoking marijuana, expecially from swaggy government weed is so far from reality it is not even funny.  I hate it when movies and TV shows depict the effects of marijuana as if it is a PCP trip or something.  It is just a pet peeve of mine because it sets the law reform movement way back because idiots who believe what they see on TV, think marijuana makes people see elves and unicorns.

I have to admit the films does have some clever stoner puns and is very quoteable, ""wesley pipes"", ""billy bong thorton"" and Bob Saget's cameo line.  Yet it does not make up for the rest of the movie being so cartoonishly fake.  That is just my two cents.",1215302400,,826,4.262820512820513

If you pay close attention, and watch it for what is secretly writen, then you will know how to properly use marijuana, and laugh. More than anything, enjoy yourselves, and don't take this movie too literally. You can't really get bonded out of jail for 10 percent of one million dollars, and everything will be ok.

We even get a semi-cameo performance from Tommy Chong as a prison inmate known as ""The Squirrel Master"" but even his over-the-top antics couldn't save the film.

The best ""pot"" movie of late that I can recall was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Lebowski/dp/B000A7DVR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Lebowski</a>&nbsp;starring Jeff Bridges. More character piece than drug-culture talk, it had a very flawed and funny ""Dude"" at its core. Here with Half-Baked, the focus is muddled with side-jokes that often miss their marks.

The story is that of four marijuana smokin' friends who live lives of idleness and degeneracy. One buzzed-out day they send Kenny (Harland Williams) out on a munchies run. But while out collecting groceries galore, Kenny accidentally feeds all of the food to a diabetic police horse standing outside the store. The horse (of course) keels over of hyperglycemia and promptly dies. Kenny is whisked off to prison and a very serious threat to his anal virginity looms large. Protected by ""The Squirrel Master"" for now, Kenny must get bailed out before his protector hits parole. His three free buddies Thurgood (Chappelle), Scarface (Guillermo Diaz) and Brian (Jim Breuer) must come up with a flood of funds to spring him. Instead of ingenuity, though, they devise a not-so-sophisticated plan of selling lots and lots of weed. The trouble is, though, that another local drug lord wants in on their scheme. Also, Thurgood has fallen for a beautiful woman who's father is in prison for selling dope, and Thurgood must decide between love and getting high.

Homage to pot movies aside, the film simply isn't funny. There are a few lines that smack of excessive attempts to make the characters laughable (""I don't do drugs. I smoke pot."") and even they just don't hit the ol' funny bone.

The biggest blessing is that the film is only 82 minutes, so you don't have to put up long with it regardless.",1182211200,4,2788,5.708433734939759

The greatest Stoner comedy within the last 20 years hands down. Maybe even of all time. If you are a stoner, just smoke here and there, or are even curious about the lives of potheads, this dvd is for you. Great cast. Everybody is great in their roles. Too many cameos too name. I could try; Jon Stewart, Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson, Tommy Chong, I couldn't imagine this movie any different.

This dvd is 'Fully Baked'. It includes - Feature Commentary by the director Tamra Davis, Outakes, Deleted Scenes, A couple different diagrams of the Types Of Stoners, and a bonus video of Grandma's Guide to Cooking Bud. (Or something like that. It's kinda interesting actually, especially on weed!)

One thing I didn't like however was it was the case with the two locks on the front (Which I guess is a good thing for a clumsy stoner such as myself) and it didn't have the inside chapter title list. Not a big deal I know, but i'm kind of a DVD Collector Buff, and like to look at those chater lists for the pictures or just to familiarize myself with the names of the chapters and how the movie is split up.

There's nothing of value here.

Dave Chapelle had nothing to do with this edition -- he's not on the commentary track or in any of the bonus materials, nor are any other actors from the film.

Don't be confused -- I LOVE LOVE LOVE Half Baked -- and I HATED the extras on this DVD.  Total waste of time and money, a big disappointment to Half Baked fans.

51331,4,0783226608,"The biggest problem with this film is the narrative revolving around Chappelle and the female love interest. I don't mean to sound malicious, but the actress can't act... at all. Enough that I consider her wholly unattractive, and enough that, sadly, it brings down Half Baked quite a bit 'cause there is just too much god forsaken time devoted to her.

The rest of the movie is a riot. All four of these guys are hugely entertaining and funny. Their characters are exaggerated stereotypes but they all hit them perfectly. When Breuer starts rattling off all the food he wants his roomate Harland Williams to get after they've all hit billy bong thorton, and it pans to Guillermo Daz blankly staring at nothing, smiling... it reminds one of the idiotic (but joyful) state of being high (and this is certainly not the only state the good plant is able to produce). People might pass off the acting in this movie but I really find it to be subtle and really nuanced... All four of them are excellent; I don't think one actor rises above the others. From what I can tell it looks like there was a lot of smoking on the set, and really I think that's one of the reasons the film comes across as authentic... it IS a half-baked, lazy movie that was made for their own enjoyment and that's where I find it to be so endearing... It IS fun.

The film isn't neccessarily pro-marijuana in that its characters are all pretty much slackers and not particularly admirable... Most of the time they are simply moronic. But simultaneously they are totally charming and loveable, and I think personally this gives the film a sort of ""harmless"" attitude towards the drug. Anyway though I really don't think politics were on the minds of any of these guys when filming, and that's why I can rewatch the damn thing over and over.

I am tempted to drop the score one but I like the film too much. The temptation comes from the copout ending... A movie this stonerfied shouldn't have the main character ditching the drug for a pathetic love interest as occurs at the end. And in Chappelle's transition to sobriety there are a few moments that kinda irked me, one which follows Breuer's uproarious story about  Killer the dog. ""I didn't think I could say this, but you guys smoke entirely too much refer."".. says Chappelle. Dunno -- rubbed me the wrong way.

But ANY WAY... this is some second-hand smoke that actually intoxicates and usually makes me laugh like a little child for two hours.",1151366400,,2469,4.6022727272727275

Join Thurgood, Brian and Scarface as they traffic super weed to 'fundraise' the bail for their best freind Kenny. The movie features Dave Chapelle with some classic calls aswell as Jim Bruer and Harland Williams. It cameos John  Stewart as the kind of stoner who thinks weed enhances every daily activity; ""ever seen the back of a 20 dollar bill.....On weeeed?"".  The movie is at it's hararious best but the extra material is pretty tacky and i'm pretty sure '5 minutes with the guy on the couch' is a completely different guy.

This is a type of movie that you can watch over and over again without it getting old.

Dave Chapelle and Jim Breuer are riotous, and the movie itself is pretty decent. There are some really funny lines in here and you can see a lot of that trademark Chapelle humor that he would later make famous on his Comedy Central show. You can read about the story elsewhere so I am going to talk about the DVD itself.

Commentaries and extras are a deciding factor for me when purchasing DVD's. Being called the ""Fully Baked"" edition, I had high expectations for this, but in terms of features, this DVD is only on par with current generation DVDs (commentaries, deleted scenes, featurettes).

The first problem is when you load the DVD, there's a smoking symbol and a non-smoking symbol to choose from, with no description of what they mean. Selecting either leads to the same features, with only the main background animation being different. Are they the director's cut and the theatrical release? I can't tell.

Lackluster commentary: Tamra Davis is completely dull! Of the more than 100 DVD's I own and dozens of other commentaries I have listened to on rented DVD's, I can't think of a more sleep-inducing commentary than hers. She is silent for long stretches of time and I spent as much time waiting for her to say something as I did listening to her talk. It is obvious she hadn't seen the film in years (something she even says at the beginning of the track), and she came totally unprepared to do the commentary recording.

Other directors are a treat to listen to and they talk the entire time, offering a lot of extra information about various things, like production difficulties, costs, whatever, just spontaneously as they watch the film again and comment on it. They don't just talk, they talk about interesting stuff. Davis is silent about half the time, and the things she does say when she opens her mouth are completely uninteresting.

crappy other features: The Granny's baking tips extra is dead unfunny. Don't even bother watching it. 5 Minutes With the Guy on the Couch is dead unfunny also, except maybe if you're trippin' balls. The deleted scenes (10 of them) are all strung together back to back, with no menu, selection screen, or any descriptions. The studio really skimped here. You have no idea what scene they are cut from. The guide to different types of smokers is just 4 or 5 short and crappy animations. Don't bother. All in all, an OK DVD with a standard treatment. Still worth it to own, but don't be fooled by the ""Fully Baked"" name. it doesn't deliver.",1134950400,9,2627,4.739606126914661

The extras & the Extras on The Jerk DVD that was released around the same time, are a complete embarrassment. Paramount should learn to give fans what they want, not make up new extra's with 0 context to the movie they are appearing on.

""Bitch, you know what I want.""

""If you want a heifer with cheese, just turn around and ask me for a heifer with cheese, yo!""

""You walk on two legs, homo erectus. Did I say 'homo'? I didn't mean that!""

Sure, if you're looking for funny lines to quote out of context with bloodshot eyes and a mouth full of Fritos, this is the best movie for you. If you're looking for comedy to enjoy while you're sober, this might not be the best DVD to purchase.

I was severely disheartened when I viewed this movie again. I haven't seen it since Freshman or Sophomore year (around the time when the movie came out in theaters), and back around those times, I had my own Billy Bong Thornton, Wesley Pipes, and if I remember correctly, I even had one named Bowl Cosby. (Weedheads aren't the most creative bunch.) Needless to say, this movie did not pack as much of a comedy punch as it did back in the day. I guess pot comedies are not as funny when you're not on pot.

A little note about the extras on this disc: they suck, blow, and any other euphemism you can think of for the action of fellatio. Different kinds of smokers? I was looking forward to more celebrity cameos, Jon Stewart and Stephen Baldwin being my favorites. What I got were several crudly animated and severely unfunny shorts about what kinds of smokers there are. If I wanted to see bad animation of unfunny material, I'd watch Shorties Watching Shorties, thanks. Granny's Guide To Bakin'? A young woman dressed up as an old woman cooking recipes with slang terms for being high in the titles. While the recipes actually do look legit and maybe even edible, do we really need to watch an old woman smoking up and completely ruining a batch of perfectly good brownies? The cook in me wanted to stick my own head in an oven.

The alternate ending is not funny. The deleted scenes were deleted for all the right reasons. I'm supremely glad that they were not included in the movie, because not only were they stupid and completely not entertaining, they also had nothing to do with the overall plot.

All in all, I am horribly disappointed in this edition. It's not worth any money you spend on it, and you'd be much better off getting the VHS edition than this subpar ""Fully Baked"" edition.

The movie has no substance but it is very funny. I especially liked the flying part the guys go through after smoking the high-grade marijuana that was received from the Drug Lab. Dave Chapelle is not a great actor as he is a stand-up artist and his entoronge of actors are always his best support. The relationship between Chapelle and his girlfriend, Mary Jane was not exploited enough except for the sex part. I guess this is the way white America will always differentiate us Black men as being always sex-hungry. I was so very happy that his girlfriend was actually black and not white. So all in all I think the movie is good and it has its very comical times which is why I watch the movie. Go Dave!! [...]",1105660800,,956,4.316666666666666

Half-Baked is one of them.  This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and most of the best jokes don't have to do with pot-smoking.  It's mostly just about 3 idiots who have to make money to get their other idiot friend out of jail and because they're pot smokers, use pot to do it.  The two funniest characters are Dave Chapelle's and the Cuban guy and they also happen to be the least stoned.  The movie isn't supposed to make sense, it's not supposed to have a purpose, it's just going to make you laugh.  And if you think all the pot humor is low brow and beneath you, then don't watch.  Pop in The Big Lebowski (a more refined, adult stoner comedy) or something and revel in your intelligence.  As for me, I'm going crack up watching Half-Baked and then probably top it off with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze.  90s comedies don't come any better than that.",1101340800,,1234,4.3304347826086955

The food he feeds him kills the horse and Kenny (mr nice guy) goes to jail for killing a cop!!!

Thurgood (Dave Chappelle) is your typical custodian (or janitor if you wanna be a jerk about it) and he and his friends Scarface (Guillermo Diaz), Kenny (Harland Williams) and Brian (Jim Breuer) all have one thing in common.  They all have the same best friend, marijuana.  They've all been friends since middle school and now that they're grown up and live in New York City, the still do their favorite past time.  After Kenny gets in trouble with the police, it's up to Thurgood, Scarface and Brian to get him out.  The problem is that they don't have the money.  They decide that the only way to get him out is to do a little ""fundraising"" and sell marijuana.  They've got to hurry because on the inside Kenny makes a fellow inmate, Nasty Nate, mad and now Nate wants ""something more"" from Kenny.  This is really a laugh out loud comedy, packed with some great cameos and all out hilarity.
Now first off, this one isn't for younger viewers because of the drug content and drug use throughout the movie.  There's also a lot of swearing as well (not as bad as JAY AND SILENT BOB STRIKE BACK but there's still a lot).  Even so, this movie is really funny.  There are a lot of laughs and Chappelle and the guys are really funny.  Plus all the cameos from Jon Stewart, Willie Nelson, Janine Garofalo, Tommy Chong, Bob Saget, Snoop Dogg and comedian David Edwards (Real World Los Angeles).  Plus there is a really funny scene in which Chappelle plays another character, Sir Smoke A Lot.  It's really funny.  Plus, Bob Saget (of all people) has a really, really outrageous line in the movie.  Trust me, the fact that it's Bob Saget just makes it wrong.
I'm not saying that you have to be into that stuff (marijuana and all) to laugh at this one because even if you look past all of the drug references and drug related topics, the movie will still make you laugh.  This is totally another great hang back and kick it movie, like FRIDAY and NEXT FRIDAY.

Maybe this was a joke that went over the heads of some reviewers, but the reason that the plot is truly half baked is that it's a stoner movie.

Oh yeah, there is also a guy that just sleeps on their couch as well.  Brian works at a record store, Scarface is employed at a burger joint, and Kenny is a kindergarden teacher.

These characters are moronic, juvenile, brainless, pathetic, and totally hilarious in the way the flop about like stoned headless chickens.

Another great part is when Thurgood has to take Mary Jane out on a date,and the whole thing with how much money he had and the meter thing was very clever. This movie is definately a must buy comedy.",1006041600,,676,4.052238805970149

Brian, Kenny, Thurgood, and Scar Face are so loveable and funny.  I can't tell you enough good things about it, all I can say is GO SEE IT! It's fantastic, and Bob Sagat saying ""I used to (...) for coke"" was the greatest, I was laughing hysterically for at least five minutes.

51485,2,0783226608,"A few months back I ventured out to the local video store after a hard day at school.  ""Hmm,"" I thought.  ""Half-Baked...this looks good.""  After all, I doubt that Jim Brewer would be involved unless it was a class operation.  ""I'll take it.""
A more unwise choice I could not have made my friends.  Aside from a few, if you can believe it, pot jokes, the movie simply falls flat on its face.  There was one particulary entertaining part where Harlan Williams unknowingly feeds a diabetic horse enough junk food to kill, well, a horse, but beyond that it was just an incessant torrent of cheap jokes aimed at your average pot-smoking high school sophomore.  As a side note directed toward the aforementioned high-schooler: I recommend taking the advice of John Stewart's character (the ""ever done this...on weed?"" guy) because otherwise you will undoubtedly realize what an incredibly ill-begotten film this really was.
I will give Tommy Chong credit for his cameo, however.  It's good to see that Mr. Chong has managed to shed his image as a low-life pothead and resurrect his once flailing career.  He's come a long way really.  Take for example his role in Tin Cup.  When he told Kevin Costner that this was their last ball on the 18th faiway of the US Open, I was truly moved.  Inspired even.  Mr. Chong, I salute you and your craft sir.
As for Half-Baked, please avoid this one.  But if you must watch it, and I recommend against it, please take one message away from it.  Pot kills brain cells kids.  It's not hair, they don't grow back.  And if you're bald, ignore the first part.",1003363200,2,1585,4.623655913978495
51486,4,0783226608,"An uneven attempt to revive the stoner comedy genre made famous in the '70s by Cheech and Chong, Half-Baked deals with three potheads who become drug dealers in order to raise money to get their friend out of jail.  The plot is an excuse to give us a comedic tour of the wide, wonderful world of marijauna.  For every funny joke, there's about ten that fall flat but, under the, shall we say, right circumstances, I've found this film to be truly hilarious.  (And if you can't pick up the hidden meaning of that statement then this film probably ain't for you.) None of the four leading actors are all that funny (I've never been a big fan of Dave Chapelle who has always seemed to be a third-rate Wayans Brother) but the film features some truly hilarious cameos with everyone from Willie Nelson to Janeane Garofalo to Snoop Doggy Dogg showing up as examples of common stoner types.  (My favorite was Jon Stewart with his whole, ""But have you ever tried watching TV ... on weed!?"" routine.)  Probably my favorite cameo (and the one scene that always has me on the floor laughing no matter what circumstances might have led to me watching the film) comes from Bob Saget of all people who, with one simply question, manages to make you wonder what really was going down on the Full House set!  I can't quote the line on this service, sadly, but anyone who hears it will never be able to get it out of their head.  Hopefully, someday, Saget and Stewart and all the other cameo actors in this film will get together to remake Reefer Madness.",1002585600,,1538,4.491039426523297

Sure this movie is stupid, and the plot is somewhat insufficient, but that is expected of all movies that focas on the topic of marijuana. You could definantly tell that stupiditiy is what the writers were aiming for, and they hit the spot. Half Baked makes it on my list of one of the most hilarious movies of all time.

I guess it's not surprising that this movie appeals to so many people, because so often what appeals to most people is the lowest-common denominator (look at any Pauly Shore movie and tell me that's not true).  There is a plot to this movie- barely.  Three pot-smoking guys decide to sell high-grade weed to raise money for a friend's bail.  That's about it.  But the plot is clearly secondary in this movie, which basically ends up being 2 hours of guys saying ""We're stoned, man!  We're stoned!  Duuuuuuuh...""  The acting isn't too bad.  But when your character is a guy who has fried his brain on pot, it's not too difficult a role to play.  Overall, this movie lacks a decent plot, good acting, and any actual humor.  Had there been any real jokes in the movie- something other than ""Duh, I'm STONED, MAN!""- the other flaws would be easier to forgive.  Half-Baked would probably be half-funny, if it were more than just an excuse to put stoners on film.",994636800,,1107,4.563451776649746

In every movie, I can find good for almost every scene, a way of understanding it and realizing what the director was trying to show his audience, but in this film, it was difficult to do that. I was very displeased in this, for it not only wasted my time, it made me think twice about renting another movie like this again. I would recommend American pie if your looking for a comedy. But for a film that does nothing but show drug usage, and shows no point in doing so, I'd recommend a more worth your while film, like Traffic or Scarface (Al Pacino).",993427200,,831,4.265822784810126
