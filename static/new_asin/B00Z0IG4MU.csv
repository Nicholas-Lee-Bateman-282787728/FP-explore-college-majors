7270312,4,B00Z0IG4MU,The one thing I was unhappy to find out was it does not play on most US DVD players. Fortunately we have a player that does play it so I was happy for that. It was my fault for not understand & reading the add more carefully. It was shipped in record time & I was very pleased with my purchase. My granddaughter loves to watch Duggee so it was purchased for her. She is very happy with the purchase.,1473033600,2,399,4.0
7270313,1,B00Z0IG4MU,"Agree with last poster- hugely disappointed. NO where in the description does it state Region 2 does not play in US. I would argue most do not know that, including myself. When I went to return it it states that you cannot return if it is correctly listed as a Region 2 format. VERY deceiving and Amazon should immediately clarify this in the description. Basically have to throw this away - and the sad thing is the kids were the most disappointed!",1471132800,10,449,4.487804878048781
