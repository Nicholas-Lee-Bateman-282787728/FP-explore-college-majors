8629621,5,B00H3TZNWG,"This is a very cool and original new horror that's really worth checking out, if you love old school horror, practical effects and gore and a man in a suit monster then this has it all, the story is great set on 31st December 1999 a couple goes on vacation to a remote ghost town camping to get away from the end of the world media, they soon get more than they bargained for! The movie has very cool effects the monster is awesome, the gore is great too, the cast is good, the movie moves along really well with several different genres all mixed into one, this is a must see, very smart cool original horror gem!! This is made by true fans of old school horror and show a small budget can do great things!!!

The German import Blu-ray has great picture quality 1080 HD
Features include lots of trailers and 2 more entire feature films for free, not very good ones though unfortunately as why they are bonus, you get Return of the killershrews and Night claws (AKA Apex-Predator) both are CGI ridden garbage.
All 3 movies on the Blu-ray play in English or German (removable subtitles)
