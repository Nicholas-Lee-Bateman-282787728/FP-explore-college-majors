5409835,3,B00ADRYGJ6,"This was one of Robert MItchum's last films.  Angie Dickenson is always a treat.  It isn't a great film, so-so murder mystery, but I am still glad to see former legends toward the end of their careers.",1413936000,2,201,4.405405405405405
5409836,4,B00ADRYGJ6,"I liked this movie. Robert Mitchum like Humphrey Bogart is great at playing world weary detectives, This film noir is even better with Mitchums voice over narration that tells you what he is thinking. I thought this was a decent movie. it's not as good as OUT OF THE PAST and FARWELL MY LOVELY but if you like Robert Mitchum you won't be disappointed I think. Plus Angie Dickinson is more than capable of providing the sex appeal for the movie. If your a fan of Robert Mitchum or Angie Dickinson and Detective movies.... This movie is worth a try.,",1407024000,3,548,4.49
5409837,3,B00ADRYGJ6,"Even at his age he was a better actor than most....  The movie was OK to watch for a ""wet afternoon""....  I have seen better movies of his .... it is sad that these actors have to grow old.... but he has many excellent movies to his credit..",1371600000,,241,4.0
5409838,5,B00ADRYGJ6,"An old movie that will keep you guessing.  Why does ""One Shoe Makes it Murder""?  Logical answer.  Mitchum in his slow pace is just the kind of movie that they do not make anymore.",1370822400,,179,4.205882352941177
5409839,5,B00ADRYGJ6,"I saw this when it originally aired more than 30 years ago and haven't seen it since. It's routine and predictable, and I mean that in a good way. Sometimes a formulaic mystery is just plain relaxing and diverting. The presence of the mighty Mitchum elevates the material to a level it perhaps doesn't deserve. Sure, it's not OUT OF THE PAST or FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, but it's worth getting for hardboiled buffs and Mitchum fans. I dislike the fake widescreen as well, but what can we do? We can boycott and email our distaste, but I doubt anyone will listen. I've been looking for this for years. I found it and watched it and enjoyed it. That's enough.",1368921600,2,652,4.487394957983193
5409840,5,B00ADRYGJ6,"A must have for Mitchum fans. Originally a TV movie, but great typical Mitchum.  Angie Dickinson for interest.  A film Noir of sorts done in 1982 with Mitchum's first TV movie role/ acting debut.  Interesting twist and turns.  The role of a washed-up cop is perfectly played by him.",1361145600,6,282,4.6938775510204085
5409841,1,B00ADRYGJ6,"This REALLY annoys me! Although it lists this 1982 made-for-movie as being in the original 4x3 aspect ratio, Warner has cropped the top and bottom of the screen to make the dvd FAKE widescreen!
I really hope that this doesn't become a trend. DO NOT CROP OLD TV MOVIES to fit the new TV screens!
I hope Warner re-releases this dvd again in the proper 4x3 ratio.",1359331200,7,360,4.388059701492537
5409842,5,B00ADRYGJ6,Looking for this movie for some time. Excellent acting by two people in the twilights of their careers. Keeps you guessing.,1358553600,3,123,4.904761904761905

5409868,4,B00ADRYGJ6,"What a great duo - Bob Mitchum and Angie Dickinson!  They make this little pseudo-noir thriller come to life.  If you are a film buff and love a tight little tale, you'll enjoy this.",1427760000,,182,4.323529411764706

5409872,4,B00ADRYGJ6,"A TV mystery murder movie bringing two big stars together again.  Robert Mitchum, in one of his last roles, plays a worn-out ex-cop and unlicensed PI working a case first to find Mel Ferrer, a good hearted rich casino owner, find his missing wife and then to find out who killed her and why.  He is romantically paired with a good hearted hooker, Angie Dickinson, who had been a friend of the wife in the old days.  Angie was attractive in the role and did not have that hard edge to her to her yet.  Good slow, but evenly, paced mystery as Mitchum moves through the case.  Well worth the watch and very entertaining.  A TV movie that Mitchum moves up into a better class film with his performance.",1419638400,4,698,4.372093023255814

8550192,3,B00ADRYGJ6,"Mitchum is Mitchum.  Angie is irresistable.  The music and voice over set a very ""noir"" atmosphere.  It is a B movie with excellent actors and a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes if you don't require a frenetic pace and huge special effects. I enjoyed it.",1472601600,,254,4.478260869565218
8550193,5,B00ADRYGJ6,"An overlooked gem and not just for fans of Robert Mitchum, Angie Dickinson and Mel Ferrer. The script is solid, if a throwback (even the filmmaker quotes The Lady from Shanghai at one point). It's a great 1982 noir, complete with haunted ""failed cop"" protagonist, homoerotic subplot, chiaroscuro lighting (or a foggy steamroom, anyway), and hard-boiled voiceover by Mitchum himself. It may seem tired, but if it had come out in 1942, it would be a classic today.",1460592000,,462,4.935897435897436

8550195,4,B00ADRYGJ6,"A tired, alcoholic former police officer is hired (why?) to find a missing woman. The job is easy, but he sees her plunging from her highrise apartment. Is it an accident, suicide or murder? One of her shoes remains in the apartment 7 or so paces from where she fell. Robert Mitchem plays the role the investigator in the zombie mode of acting. It is hard to imagine him as having any romantic interest. Still, the detective musters enough interest and alertness to solve what turns out to an an intriguing mystery.",1442620800,,515,4.608695652173913
8550196,2,B00ADRYGJ6,An okay film.,1440201600,,13,3.6666666666666665
8550197,4,B00ADRYGJ6,"Robert Mitchum was Robert Mitchum. He like friend John Wayne was good at playing the same character. The script sucked. The cast made it work. The mistake was believing the audience were dumb. I guess back in the day of goofy Hollywood T.V. we were. I watch some of the old television shows I used to adore, and feel stupid because I liked them. They were some of the worse acting and scripts ever. It is no wonder that the real actors on TV actually made it big like Pierce Brosnan and Bruce Willis and TV heroes like David Hasselhof and Tom Selleck never really became the  Movie Stars of Film. Both great on TV but lousy on film. I digress. The movie is certainly worth watching, Angie Dickinson also does her usual good enough for television performance. She too never really made it as a Movie star but made a living on TV. Over all this is an entertaining TV movie worth watching, especially if you like Robert Mitchum.",1437609600,2,925,4.4411764705882355
