8355543,4,B000VZGIHI,"This is a cute video if you are looking for some craft ideas for kids or for a kid's party.  Some of the ideas were similar to other videos, but there were a few new ideas.  It was interesting enough for the price.  The person presenting the video is obviously enthusiastic about Halloween.  The crafts would be pretty easy to make and not very expensive to buy supplies.

I was in the mood to try some of the ideas after watching the video, which I think is the sign of a good craft video.",1214179200,,490,4.170212765957447
