2064711,5,B00026L9CU,"This is a fantastic made for TV movie which shows the struggles of suffragettes during World War One.  It mainly follows the story of Alice Paul.

The movie does a great job of showing the struggles experienced by the women's suffrage movement & how there were different views on how hard to push for the vote within the movement.

I think this video is great for students except for 2 parts:
- A bar butt scene
- a bathtub masturbation scene (nothing is shown, but it is very much implied)
The bathtub scene is easily skipped as the entire DVD chapter adds nothing to the story line",1468540800,5,583,4.429906542056075

However, this movie tell the story from the struggles of the radical wing of the movement lead by Alice Paul and I have to say, I was completely fascinated the entire time.  Even though I'm well informed on the topic, I was on the edge of my seat.  Hillary Swank shines as an actress, especially in her prison mental evaluations scenes.  And the story is just so compelling.  Sometimes the makeup and the dialogue doesn't seem really time period.

These were ""iron jawed"" women who fought for the right of women to vote in America.  Hillary Swank is amazing in this.  She is staunch and determined, and will not let anything, or anyone, get in the way of the cause.  Excellent acting by Frances O'Conner!  Angelica Huston seemed awkwardly out of place.  Julia Ormond is excellent as the beauty on the horse, attracting attention to the movement.  These were bright, educated women, who would not take ""NO"" for an answer to voting rights.

However, the editing and some of the artistic choices were just terrible. The music was anachronistic and distracting, and the ""artsy"" editing really took away from the very real drama going on. I wish they would take the raw video and re-edit it, re-score it, and then re-release it! Hillary Swank certainly deserves better treatment for her work than this movie turned out to be. That said, I'd still have to recommend it because I know of no other movie that gets inside the fight for women's suffrage in the US and educates us like this one.",1434931200,,705,4.648

It has strong emotional impact and, from reading other reviews has inspired many women to appreciate what it took; what it means to have gained a voice - the vote.  On a recent trip to Washington, D.C. I stepped out of a cab to find myself standing in front of a stone on which was inscribed a dedication to Alice Paul, the main character in this film and the real life woman who dedicated her heart and strength to the suffragist cause. I had to take a moment to catch my breath. Until viewing Iron Jawed Angels I hadn't realized how important her role was and how appreciated she was by anyone in Washington. Standing on that corner I felt I had been so clueless. But I was extremely gratified to discover that many, many people (like myself) hold Ms. Paul in the highest esteem.

Familiar faces (Hilary Swank, Frances O'Connor, Julia Ormond , Angelica Huston, Brooke Smith) embody the passion of the suffragettes who gave their all to win the fight to enact the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. Dramatic, mounting tension in physical and emotional conflicts leave one with a better understanding of just what was earned through their efforts. This movie will keep you on a roller coaster of righteous anger, fear, frustration, determination, cringing angst, admiration, and triumph.  I like to give this movie to young ladies reaching their age of majority and registering to vote as a reminder that it is a right and responsibility not to be taken lightly.",1424736000,,772,5.070866141732283

2064798,4,B00026L9CU,"If you can get past the silly Hollywood aspects of the first third or so of this film, it is very good. The early part seems to be trying to be hip and current and sexy.  The film as a whole really brings to life the movement for women's suffrage in the United States, with a particular emphasis on the innovative tactics of Alice Paul.  She pioneered the use of marches and picketing the White House, which have become commonplace today.  When she and her supporters were arrested she used a hunger strike very effectively to bring attention to their mistreatment.  Many people at the time viewed these nonviolent tactics as unusually and perhaps even inappropriately confrontational.  However, they focused attention on the issue and applied great pressure on opponents and potential allies to actively support women's suffrage.  Skip over the first bit of the film and you have an excellent dramatization of a major political milestone in American history.",1420243200,,959,4.9625

The acting was okay, but not the best I have seen, and if I remember correctly there were a few parts that elongated the movie a little too much. I would recommend it.

2064919,4,B00026L9CU,"This is one of those made-for-TV, or low budget, ""movies with a message"" that practically requires screening for the audience it might best serve--for example, students unfamiliar with the suffrage movement or even with the meaning of the word--before making any evaluation of worth or weight.  As others have observed, the film runs a little long (90 minutes would have seemed preferable to its more than 120), and a few details of plot and mis en scene (the lavish costumes) betray a hurried, even occasionally cartoonish, quality about the production.  What distracted me most was the ""score""--the moment I heard a rock band along with the sound of an electric guitar with the distort pedal activated my critical censors became activated.  Certainly, it couldn't have been a budget-breaker to have employed ""time-resistant"" classical music or at least music that, if ""period-specific,"" would be appropriate to the film's narrative setting.

Seeing Angelica Houston reminded me of her appearance in her father's last movie--an adaptation of Joyce's ""The Dead"" (in some respects, as ""unfilmable"" as a movie could be--but that was Joyce's, not the Houstons', fault).  And contrary to some reviews, I was impressed by Hillary Swank (admittedly offering the camera an unexpectedly sensual face).  But the real question, as always, is: can image-saturated, hyper-critical young people ""buy"" this representation of a genuine hero and the pivotal historical moment she represents?

Such great actresses portraying important, intriguing historical characters. Hilary Swank and company was fabulous! My problem with the film? The director should have never filmed one scene. It was totally inappropriate. The story is about a strong-willed, intelligent woman who simply believed that all women should have an equal right to vote for those who represent them in the government of a country that was built on freedom and liberty. She was willing to stake her life on that belief. This is a woman that everyone should be proud of. Her strength and integrity was remarkable!

So, why did HBO and the director decide to degrade her? I'm really having a tough time understanding why it was necessary to show a scene of her bathing and masturbating? REALLY?? This woman was a Quaker. She was educated. She was young. She was single. She was fighting for her beliefs. The sexual nature of her being was her private business. The movie was not about her love life. This movie could have been fantastic. It could have been used a learning tool for all young people, showing them the importance of a single vote. Instead the director chose to degrade her character.

The director's choice of film techniques are distracting, as is the anachronistic soundtrack.  Apparently the writers didn't think these powerful women were interesting enough, so they *invented* a love interest, played by Prince Charming (Patrick Dempsey), and then showed long scenes of Alice Paul (Hilary Swank) masturbating in the bathtub, presumably frustrated by her single-minded devotion to her cause that kept her from realizing her great desire - perhaps this is supposed to assure the viewer that she was not a lesbian?  Having endured torture at the hands of US government officials, our heroines finally gain the rights of citizenship, and all they have to say is ""How's my hair?"" before stepping outside to meet the press.  That was the last line of the film.  It takes real effort to turn one of the most powerful social movements in this country's history into an anti-feminist screed, but these filmmakers pulled it off.  A sign of the times, I guess.  The right wing should hire them to appropriate other feminist causes.",1332288000,17,1205,5.11734693877551

This film looks at the last seven years of the Suffrage movement, most notably the National Womens Party, founded by Alice Paul and Lucy Burns. Iron Jawed Angels tells of the struggles women faced during the Wilson administration before finally gaining equal rights under the 19th Amendment which was ratified in 1920.

2064943,3,B00026L9CU,"I am a big suffrage buff and would have loved to give this movie a positive review, but its flaws are significant, and ""mixed"" is the best I can do.

The single biggest problem is the way Alice Paul is presented as a person.  Paul in real life was a zealot, first and last.  She could never have been a character in a romantic comedy, but the version of her portrayed by Hilary Swank is right out of Hollywood's playbook for chick flicks.

What redeems and justifies the movie is the extended sequence of the suffragists' confinement to prison and mistreatment there.  I believe this part of the movie is pretty true to what actually happened.  This was a very important and relatively little known chapter in U.S. history--it's a great thing that this movie will help a new generation to be aware of the martyrdom of Alice Paul and the other militant suffragists.

2064963,5,B00026L9CU,"Iron Jawed Angels depicts the final stages of the battle for the women's right to vote.  This is an excellent HBO production, and it plays more like a big-screen release than a made-for-TV production (as HBO is known to do).

The centerpiece of this film is the work of Alice Paul (Hillary Swank) and Lucy Burns.  These sufferagettes met in England and brought their passion home to the United States in 1912.  They attracted a group of young, dedicated, educated women that went to work in Washington, D.C.,to lobby for the vote.  This is the same year Woodrow Wilson took office.  Their decision to picket the White House, even during the early days of WWI brought down the ire of many people upon them, and even resulted in their unlawful arrests and imprisonment.  Alice Paul was the heart and soul of this effort and, though she was a relative latecomer to the fight, provided the spark that inspired women to take up the challenge.  The treatment of the sufferagettes in prison was eye-opening.

The cast is amazing, and there is not a weak performance among them.  You will see many familiar faces among the cast.

The film is of high quality and deserves to be seen.  There are a few disjointed scenes here and there, like Swank in the bathtub, but all in all, it is an excellent period piece dramatizing actual events.

Watching a film like this makes me ashamed about the times I have taken for granted the right to vote, and inspired me to be a better-informed voter and citizen.

The little moments of humor between the character were good and I bought the friendly affection between the leads.

I disliked the way the movie ended as well - in traditional biopic fashion they tell, rather than show, that the battle was not over. I would have preferred an additional scene showing that Alice Paul was not done fighting especially given one of the discussions she had earlier in the film. Hell I would have even taken a montage as horrible as those usually are.

The movie was two hours long but I still felt that it was far too short and that it gave short shrift to many issues. The romantic relationship between Alice Paul and the WaPo reporter seemed to just hang in the air and not do much. Race is brought up as a 5 second aside in two separate scenes; I would have liked to see a lot more development there. Honestly, I think that this would have been benefited by miniseries treatment. It's a fertile period of history and I think taking some time to develop the stories would have given far more depth and reduced the need for fancy camera/narrative tricks.

This film is brilliantly acted and exceptionally well written.  It addresses the process of getting the ammendment passed and it addresses the fact that this battle was waged during World War 1.

I personally believe that all high schools (Public and private) should screen and discuss this film.  We are so fortunate to live in a place and time when we CAN have a voice in our government but many even now do not have that right.  Watching the struggle of our ancestors, knowing that their were those that died IN THIS COUNTRY so that I can participate in my government is an important reminder to all citizens all the time.

One important point - the force-feeding scene is graphic.  While we should not shy away from it (This was what killed some of the early sufferagettes.  The folks doing the forced feeding were often neither skilled nor gentle.), it is important to not inflict this film on anyone too young.  Please do not show it to anyone under 15.

It probably helps to have had some background in the long battle for women's right to vote as this story picks it up in the final stages and takes it to the finish line. Others have said that it may try too hard not to be a period piece and that is probably a fair criticism as the characters may be a little more reflective of today than the early 1900's. Having said that, it has always taken people who have that radical toughness and obsession to break down barriers in society. Isn't it amazing that our Constitution that proclaimed 'all men are created equal....' took so long to make it really viable for half of our population, not to mention the battles for freedom from slavery and the subsequent struggle for voting rights of African-Americans. Our country was founded in revolution and struggle-both ideological and physical and that was the beginning as we have struggled to define 'all men' since then. This is a movie worth watching for the reminder of the hard fought (they literally experienced physical violence and wrongful imprisonment) rights that some in our society have had to battle for while others have been able to take for granted those same freedoms. This is the story of a sad chapter in our history and the women who paved the way for their daughters and granddaughters to have an equal (mostly) seat at the table.

2065016,5,B00026L9CU,"Closing in on 100 years after women gained the right to vote in America, few know what a momentous struggle it was to establish the franchise among the female half of the population. ""Iron Jawed Angels"" tries to erase the misconception that the work of getting the vote was just the work of quaintly-dressed, semi-masculine suffragettes. In actuality, the road was long, frustrating and sometimes violent.

The movie focuses on Alice Paul, a young Quaker PhD from Swarthmore, played brilliantly by Hilary Swank. Paul represents the new breed of suffrage worker who, armed with advanced degrees and a passion for activism and justice, make the final push for the franchise. The movie shows us the difficult work of organizing reluctant women to support voting, as well as the political infighting that took place within the movement, Older suffrage supporters, like Carrie Chapman Catt (played by the magnificent Angelica Huston) have been firmly, patiently, yet unsuccessfully asking for the vote for years. Deferential to men in power, they hope to gain the vote by slowly amassing support at the state level. Alice Paul and her young comrades, like Lucy Burns (played by Frances O'Connor) and Reverend Anna Howard Shaw (played by Lois Smith) take a different tack, ""manning"" the phones and organizing public events to bring attention to their demand for the vote. But when World War I begins, there is a dilemma in the movement. Should suffragism go underground again until the hostilities end? Or is this the time to press even harder? When Alice Paul and her cohorts decide to go for it, they set in motion a series of events that leads to violence, imprisonment under trumped up charges and abuse.

Though ""Iron Jawed Angels"" is excellent, it has a few problems, notably the awkward title, which is equally descriptive and disparaging of the suffragists' determination. Then, there is the unfortunate (but predictable) love interest for Paul - Ben Weissman, a fictional newspaper cartoonist played by hunky Patrick Dempsey. A particualrly unfortunate bathtub scene (you'll know it when you see it.) in which Hilary muses on an afternoon encounter with Weissman, comes close to devolving into soft porn. Such nonsense is both unnecessary and out of keeping with the film's uplifting tone of female empowerment.

""Iron-Jawed Angels"" is smartly written, very well acted and informative about a historical period that mostly wins smirks. Great acting turns by the above named as well as by Vera Farmiga as a Russian immigrant and Molly Parker as the timid wife of a US Senator. The film's best line is delivered at a White House meeting with a reluctant President Woodrow Wilson. When a comparison of suffragist demands to Patrick Henry's ""Give me Liberty of give me Death"" speech is called ""apples and oranges,"" a participant says that ""In oranges and women, courage is often mistaken for insanity."" This film tells the true story about courage and a drive for equality and justice. Inspiring and moving.",1224374400,,3006,5.080971659919029

2065021,3,B00026L9CU,"Long before this movie was recommended to me by a female friend, I had seen this movie at Blockbuster and passed it over.  The cover and title combined to make it look like a soft core porn/slasher film which wouldn't merit my time and energy.  I was completely wrong of course.  Upon personal recommendation and an e mail touting the importance of the early work of these women, I looked up the DVD on Amazon.

I did learn a lot about the sacrifices made by these women and a few new historical perspectives.  There was an agenda which accompanied the e mail I received and it was supported by the movie..""Look at all the sacrifices these women made early on...now don't go an waste your vote after all they've done for you..."" The email came from a conservative friend who was formerly in the military.  (I think the endorsement of this movie implied, furthermore that a liberal vote in the upcoming presidential election would be such a waste, but I digress..)

I am a videographer and a movie buff, so I look at any movie from the standpoint of the production values involved.  I really felt like this would make a great made for TV movie.  It was full of cliche renderings to make its point.  It was even peppered with a little sex and romantic interests.  The protagonist engages breifly in a daliance with a newspaper man she has come to know.  Whether it was the morais of the day or her divided loyalties to her cause, she was unable to fully indulge herself in the banality of such a relationship.  However, her fantasies win out during a bathtub scene where she is obviously masturbating.  I wasn't offended by the notion, it's just that it seemed like gratuitus sex to me, designed to spice up the story line for viewers.  It also has the impact of nixing a showing to the local women's club by my friend.

Overall, it was informative, but perhaps not entirely historically accurate.  It was a good one time viewing, but I wished I had rented it originally instead of buying it as it is not a ""keeper"" in my estimation.",1223510400,3,2031,4.505464480874317

Anthony) is not the one who sees it through to victory. I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't think that Hilary Swank ever really connected to the character. She always seemd to be toying with the ideas, but sadly, didn't come across as ""completely in character"".

Excellent film, that while not completely accurate in it's entirety, still manages to capture the spirit, frustration and rare moments of exhilaration during the height of the women's suffrage movement.  The movie shows the historic ""War of the Roses"" in which the pro and anti suffragist legislators wore their yellow and red roses, but there was one heroine who wasn't even there and who played perhaps the biggest role with the most concise note:

Dear Son,

Hurrah and vote for suffrage!  Don't keep them in doubt.  I noticed some of the speeches against.  They were bitter.  I have been watching to see how you stood, but have not noticed anything yet. Don't forget to be a good boy and help Mrs. Catt (Carrie Chapman Catt - the character portrayed by Anjelica Huston) put the ""rat"" in ratification.

2065040,5,B00026L9CU,"This story is especially poignant now, while America is in the midst of a presidential election where a woman, Hillary Clinton, is vying for the Democratic nomination, and all the candidates are sloganeering the concept of ""change."" Iron Jawed Angels portrays the struggles and sacrifices made by the Suffragists Alice Paul (portrayed by Hilary Swank) and Lucy Burns (portrayed by Frances O'Connor). Along with their diverse team of recruits--from a senator's wife to an immigrant factory worker--they surpassed the efforts of their ""older sisters"" and succeeded in changing the old guard political machinery of the United States, winning the right for women to vote.

Call them Suffragists, call them Feminists, women who've fought for rights in our nation's history have often been portrayed as masculine, ball-busting bra-burners. This film does a beautiful job at depicting the beauty and intelligence of these modern, college-educated women, and isn't afraid to show them admiring fashion or worrying about how their hair looks. At the same time, it pays homage to the original Suffragists, including Carrie Chapman Catt (portrayed by Angelica Houston) who succeeded Susan B. Anthony as head of the National Woman Suffrage Association. The upbeat musical score pumps additional energy into the telling of these tireless women, willing to give everything for their cause. We, their descendents, owe them a debt of gratitude.

Hillary Clinton may be breaking the so-called glass ceiling in today's American politics; however, she has it EASY compared to Alice Paul and Lucy Burns and what it took to pass the 19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote.

What a shame - men and women of all ages find this movie appealing and I have sent quite a few online to order their own copies. I use this in my U.S. History II class and will be using it in my Women in American History class next fall. The film gives us insight as to how social movements actually succeed in this country.

 If Carrie Chapman Catt's strategy was left to wend it's merry way through the states, many of us would still not be able to vote. Alice Paul's militancy pushed Wilson to the wall- woman's suffrage was no longer a petition, or supplication, but a demand for political equality under the Constitution.(At this time the 16th Amendment was working its way through the states to be ratified in 1913.) Paul in a face- to-face meeting with the President, reminds him that women pay taxes and that ""taxation without representation""  was the reason for the American Revolution.

Paul strategically deepened the movement by successfully appealing to wealthy women and by forming ties with radical women in the labor movement- connecting labor's need for the vote as a way of fulfilling their own agenda- by obliquely referring to the Triangle Shirtwaist fire.

Yet it is truly the combination of Catt and Paul that win the battle. Neither could have done it alone. Paul was able to embarrass the administration into proposing the amendment, but it is Catt's organization, already at work in the states, that gets the amendment ratified.

A factor not to be overlooked was that Wilson was able to save face by claiming that he was ""rewarding"" the ladies (in Catt's organization-NAWSA) and that the radical element (Paul's NWP)had in no way influenced his decision to support the amendment. Unfortunately,for many years that is the account that historians and even women's historians have repeated. This film, based on the Doris Steven's account, Jailed for Freedom, sets the record straight.",1196467200,,2021,4.826589595375722

Iron Jawed Angels really speaks to young women, drawing parallels between today's employed, educated, intelligent women who are just too busy to be activists, and our political elder stateswomen, who are so often horrified that we seem to be taking our rights for granted and not fighting to extend and preserve what we have. The young feminists of the 1910s shocked their elders with their protests (see Code Pink), their smoking (see Sex in the City), their sexual liberty (see sex positive feminism) and their will to power.

What's amazing about this film is that so little of it ever crosses a school-child's desk. As a product of the public schools, where we rarely got past the Civil War, and nearly never made it to this time period, I found the film eye-opening and shocking but also hopeful and important. I will never cast a ballot again without thanking the women who were beaten, abused, force-fed and considered quite possibly insane so that I could vote.

Indeed, it is a sobering thought that just one hundred years ago, long after the Revolutionary and Civil Wars were fought, women did not have the right to vote and were told to stay home.

The friendships and the hardships and the difficult decisions these women shared are depicted and acted like it's rarely been seen before.

2065053,4,B00026L9CU,"Throughout time, history has proven itself to fill our imaginations with stories of perseverance and determination, only to find ourselves repeating the life lessons of our ancestors over and over again. Occasionally, an exceptional example to the contrary occurs, as we see in the woman's suffrage movement of the early 20th century. Iron Jawed Angels, HBO's dramatic and emotionally stirring fictional account of the trial and tribulations endured by the women activists involved in this fight, is a film that does just that. Released on DVD in the fall of 2004, the film reveals in the battle between traditonal culture and values, and a new class of bravado and progressivism that has endured for years benefiting both past and future activists of equal rights.

 The film stars Hilary Swank as Alice Paul, a young defiant yet charismatic woman growing up in a time when most would rather see her role as a bright, contemporary leader regulated to cleaning the house and making the families dinner. Swank does neither, as we see her embark on a drama filled journey of conflict and betrayal to secure the voting rights for American woman and witness the pain and hardship all women involved in this movement are forced to endure. The film builds on this as it concludes with her quest finally ending with the passing of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on August 26th, 1920.

 At times, I did feel like I was given an intermission of sorts, as we witness theme transformations and plot deviations in the form of a less than stellar romance involving Swanks lead character and a widowed but determined Washington Post editor brilliantly portrayed by Patrick Dempsey.  Francis O'Connor plays the remarkably likable but slightly vulnerable Lucy Burns, a sidekick of sorts who revels in the day she herself can settle down for marriage and a family to call her own. Legendary film veteran Angelica Houston tops off the films honors with her excellent and riveting portrayal of the leader of the National Woman's Suffrage Organization.

An excellent example of how everyday woman can bring about change and optimism in modern day society, I felt enlightened and somewhat motivated after viewing Iron Jawed Angels. Questions I had about the treatment of the activists had been answered, for I had no idea why Swank and her cohorts had been labeled the `Iron Jawed Angels' before seeing the film. Witnessing a scene in which Swank is held down in a confinement chair while forcibly feed liquid nourishment as to combat her fasting crusade and avoid a martyrdom, I now had a new found understanding of what it meant to truly dig in and fight for your beliefs.

Interestingly enough, discussions in my college Modern American History class that I've had the opportunity to be involved in have really helped in my understanding of how events of the past, even some that may seem trivial in comparison to modern day conflict, can take hold and shape how a culture looks at itself for generations to come. Minority based civil rights of the 1960's would prove a keen example of this, as African Americans could look into the past for one of the first times in our nations history and find role models in the woman that suffered unspeakable defiance in the face of ever changing and turbulent times.

Had it not been for the courage and determination of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns, along with hundreds if not thousands of other woman activists that held their ground and fought for suffrage rights, I believe that America would be less of a nation, one still involved in disagreement and inner turmoil over equal rights regardless of gender.

The film and the performances are very well done and it is not done in a heavy-handed way.  Honestly, it is AMAZING what these women went through and most women today have no idea about this time in history and all that was fought for and gained because we take our independence for granted.

There are a couple major issues I have with the film.  The use of contemporary music instead of period pieces.  It is jarring and helps to destroy the 'suspension of disbelief' we all experience when watching period films.  It also doesn't lend itself well to the time period depicted.

2065069,1,B00026L9CU,"Combining dialogue that appears to have been lifted from old political pamphlets with a rock music score more appropriate to a modern cosmetics commericial (lots of guitars and vibraphones, let's call it ""Rock On with NAWSA""), this film tells the viewer much more about Hollywood femnists' perceptions of the past, than it does about the past itself. All decked out in Edwardian costumes, the cast works its way through a series of thankfully brief scenes in which enlightened women slay dominant males with verbal ripostes and quips, all loaded with telling facts and figures that reveal the extent of sex discrimination in the Progressive Era. These scenes also include the occasional disgruntled woman, for the moment reluctant to enlist in the movement, yet after being exposed to a few suffragist talking-points, she too will take up the banner and join the NAWSA crusade. Perhaps the most forgettable moment in two hours of not very clever dialogue came early on when Alice told a Washington Post reporter: ""I'm having dinner with Helen Keller."" The reporter, ""Don't stare, she hates that.""

Yet, I suppose the most annoying aspect of this film is the music: rock is not only inapposite to the 1910s, it is completely at odds with the seriousness with which suffragists conducted their campaigns. Indeed, one of the few songs the producers chose from the early 20th century was ""Ain't She Sweet""-- a Roarin' Twenties jazz standard introduced in 1927 by Paul Ash & His Orchestra at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago and thereafter adopted by such entertainers as Eddie Cantor and Sophie Tucker.

Alice Paul was hardly a flapper, nor was she an astute poitical strategist. She was a militant activist whose overwrought contribution to winning the vote for women only complemented the much greater, much more productive efforts of Carrie Chapman Catt (Angelica Huston) and others who had continued the struggle since Seneca Falls in 1848. Catt used Paul's antics to good effect in eventually persuading President Wilson (here, woefully overweight) to endorse suffrage as a route to victory in the Great War. Paul was at most a footnote in the process.

I showed this film to my Gilded Age-Progressive Era class last spring; consider a few written comments from today's undergraduates: ""disjointed"" -- ""historically inept and emotion-ridden"" -- ""this was Hilary Swank in INSOMNIA Part 2"" -- ""numerous historical inaccuracies included women's hair and men's clothing styles from later eras, the misuse of props like a small woman's wrist watch and a Crown Graphic press camera, both of which did not exist in 1918, plus the American flag behind Wilson is hung backwards"" -- ""the parts where she (Paul/Swank) was jailed reminded me of that holocaust movie by Speiberg, but his was more convincing"" & my favorite: ""why not really screw it up and throw in a little Helen Reddy at the end?""",1161388800,30,2885,5.05672268907563

2065076,5,B00026L9CU,"What a splendid film! Imagine what it must have been like for women in that era.  And, yet, they stood up and took it.  The yelling, the violence, the loss of security...  The beautiful Inez, like a Joan of Arc, she perished under the weight of her calling.  As I watched the scenes in the ""workhouse"" (jail) and the hunger strike, I was struck by the brutality of the forced feedings.  It is so sad that this practice continues (in an even cruder form) in Guantanamo to people who still haven't been charged with crimes, people who may be innocent.  Instead of devolving,as we seem to be lately, our democracy should be evolving.  The problem is that most Americans are out of touch with their history.

 If more young women watched this film, they would know how hard won are the freedoms that many take for granted.  If more young people knew labor history, they would know that they can thank the blood, sweat,and tears of people who proceeded them for their weekends, vacations, and 8 hour days.  Even now, though, we are sliding behind.  Europeans, who borrowed our notions of labor law, have bypassed us and their workers have greater benefits and work less hours.

I'm glad that Alice Paul isn't here to see young women of today rate each other's worth on talk shows by how much jewelry men give them. It's pretty sad... I hope more young people watch these kinds of films, read books that give them history from the perspective of the governed, like Howard Zinn's ""People's History of the United States.""

 I thought the actors all did a superb job - even Dr. McDreamy - who I guiltily admit to enjoy watching in Grey's Anatomy on Sunday nights.  Someone reviewing remarked that his smirking detracted from this movie.  Yeah.. he does have the same look on Grey's Anatomy. That reminds me of something a friend pointed out to me years ago.  He said (for those who are old enough to remember this actor), that Richard Widmark had two facial expressions - blank and confused.  Well, let's hope this younger actor can master more than a smirk in the future.  It was nice,though, to see a man as a decoration in a woman's movie.

Although my fellow reviews criticize the superfluous aspects of the movie (a love interest and random small talk), it helps to describes Paul's drive and determination to achieve the right for women to vote.  The writer and director of the movie ""Iron Jawed Angels"" did their homework to find the true Alice Paul, and it is evident for anyone who has studied the women suffragists of the 1910s.

Another bad idea is the repeated use of multiple images with looped sound. This stuff looks like parts of a deranged music video accidently spliced in.",1123977600,5,540,4.858695652173913
2065080,4,B00026L9CU,"The meaning of the title for this 2004 HBO movie becomes clear in the final act when sister suffragette Alice Paul (Hilary Swank) is arrested for ""obstructing traffic"" by standing in front of the White House and reading aloud public statements made by President Woodrow Wilson.  Convicted on the trumped up charges and thrown in a workhouse with over 200 over suffragettes, Paul goes on a hunger strike and eventually is force fed against her will.  The picture of Paul, jaw clenched against the coming intrusion, becomes iconic for the film, especially given the idea expressed at different times in different ways in the film that points out that courage in women is mistaken by men as being insanity.

""Iron Jawed Angels"" is the story of the radical suffragettes who broke away from the National American Woman Suffrage Association and its president Carrie Chapman Catt (Angelica Huston).  By the time Woodrow Wilson (Bob Gunton) entered he White House in 1912 there were a handful of states that had given women the right to vote.  NAWSA wants to continue to go state by state, but Paul, Lucy Burns (Frances O'Connor) and other like-minded younger women want to push for an Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to give women the right to vote.  Facing opposition from the old guard and political conservatives, the women also face apathy from Wilson's administration.  Marching for women's suffrage before Wilson's inauguration the women are attacked, and this foreshadows worse things to come, especially once America's entry into World War I is supposed to stop the movement in its tracks and Paul insists on pushing forward.

Directed by Katja von Garnier, ""Iron Jawed Angels"" has a script put together by Jennifer Friedes (who came up with the story), Sally Robinson, Eugenia Bostwick Singer & Raymond Singer, and it is not overly simplistic to say that the film shows that the movement for women's rights had a dark side that makes it more akin to the labor and civil rights movements than our history textbooks lead us to believe.  The problematic elements with the movie come in the early parts.  I did not want to be distracted by any spark of romance between Paul and editorial cartoonist Ben Weissman (Patrick Dempsey), because such things become immaterial when Paul is being straight-jacketed and having her jawed ratcheted open.  Early on in the film there are some funky examples of editing and at one point Sarah McLaughlan starts singing ""Fumbling Towards Ecstasy,"" but such contemporary concerns are stripped away in that final act when the question is whether Paul and her colleagues are going to survive long enough to see the Women's Suffrage Amendment passed.

Fortunately, ""Iron Jawed Angels"" saves the best for last and whatever you think of the first couple of acts of the movie the last one will catch your complete attention.  Swank has certainly cornered the market on playing a suffering woman, but her best moment is when she is questioned by a doctor concerning her beliefs and mental state, and she more than holds her own.  Ultimately it is the contrast between the silent actions of these imprisoned women and the babbling hypocrisies coming out of the mouth of the district commissioner and other politicians that eloquently drives home the point of this movie.  Of course, the idea that merely quoting the president could constitute treason is a delicious irony (and one that has certainly existed ever since).

But in dramatizing the story of the push for the 19th Amendment there is always a tendency to be overly dramatic and everything gets reduced to the idea that Paul, Burns and the others are suffering so that Catt finally realizes they have given her a big chip to play in this game of power politics.  I guess I want to think that on some level the idea of equality being inherently just came into play, and I know that I really do not want to think that gender equality in this country came down to one state legislator receiving a note from his mother.  The result is not a movie that is short of perfection but which still demands attention for the story it tells, the cause it embraces, and the women it honors.",1123286400,6,4163,4.8559322033898304

2065082,4,B00026L9CU,"This movie is a nice study in the effectivness of different methods of social protest. In any movement there are often different opinions over what methods to use to achieve their goals. It's one of the historical ironies that in staid stiff upperlip England, the suffrigist movement used very in-you-face techniques with ladies in lace gloves sticking small bombs in MPs mailboxes, storming parliament and pelting the members with eggs. While in rough-and-tumble America, for decades the suffrigists were very lady-like and tried to do nothing to offend the politicians and public. Was it the efforts of the suffrigists that got the vote or would it have come anyway since at that time legions of women were attending college and entering the workforce as a result of the WWI labor shortages? This is an excellent film to study the dynamics of social change.

The only fault I found was the obvious pandering to the youth audiance by throwing in a superfluous love story and a bathtub self-pleasuring scene that cluttered the story. (Also the music belonged more to an Ophra movie than the early 20th century.) The movie needed less ""sex"" and more on Carrie Chapman Catt to examine why she held her differing views on suffrigist strategy. The powerful images of the women being attacked and mistreated was enough to attract the youth market.",1121990400,,1342,4.964444444444444
2065083,5,B00026L9CU,"In a role that was tailor-made for her, a tomboyish and intelligent-looking Hilary Swank leads a stellar cast in Katja von Garnier's look at the second-generation suffragettes who saw the push for the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, granting women the right to vote, end victoriously.
  Occasionally, I found the modern score of this tale of the early 20th century to be rather off-putting, but have come to appreciate its usefullness in attracting a modern audience.
 I have been provided with a lesson about the suffragettes who lived to celebrate the passage of the 19th Amendment that was hitherto unknown to me, although I was familiar with the story of the attacks on the suffragettes during the 1913 parade in Washington.
  As Lucy Burns, the exotically beautiful Frances O'Connor, with her sharp, dark eyes, olive skin, red hair, and a strict Irish Catholic upbringing similar to  that of the character she plays, is every bit Swank's equal.
 The group of suffragettes really come to life in this  production, becoming more than the staid women in historical black and white photos. As is exemplified when Alice commandeers Lucy's new lavender hat, and by their kidding around at a photo session during a rally, they are far from humorless, and in fact,are prankish and spirited, although serious about their cause.
 Anjelica Huston's performance as Carrie Chapman Catt was worthy of the Golden Globe she received for it. She is primly assertive as she challenges the policies of the young suffragettes, and is either confrontational or supportive of Bob Gunton's President Wilson depending on the issue. Ultimately, she comes to respect the young suffragettes for their bravery in their endurance of abuse and a hunger strike during their unjust incarceration.
 Julia Ormond is tragically brave and bravely tragic as Inez Milholland, whose sacrifice brings bittersweetness to the eventual outcome.
 Molly Parker's Emily Leighton, the wife of Senator Tom Leighton (Joseph Adams), is as demure and docile as a live Victorian porcelain doll in the beginning, but as she is recruited to the cause, impresses her husband and the world when she shows the stuff she is truly made of.
 Vera Farmiga's  full-lipped Slavic beauty and strength are well used in her role as the immigrant factory worker Ruza Wenclawska.
 Brooke Smith's Mabel Vernon keeps the suffragettes and the NAWSA (National American Women's Suffrage Association) budget on an even keel.
 Adalah Barnes gives spark to the courage of Ida Wells Barnett, who joins the marchers over the objections of Southern delegates who did not want an integrated rally, and Carrie Snodgress, in her last role, typifies the down-home strength of a farm woman as she consoles her daughter, Alice after the death of one of the leading suffragettes, encouraging her to renew the fight despite the setback.
 Patrick Dempsey's newspaper columnist, Ben Weissman, is a widowered father and potential love interest for Alice.
 Both Alice and Lucy play off well against each other as they discuss their campaign strategy. While she inevitably has her down moments,Alice always knows what to say to win recruits to the cause and to keep those involved in it committed. The definitive moment in the struggle is probably Alice's confrontation with the prison psychiatrist, who expresses his admiration of her gallantry in his report to President Wilson.
 On August 18, 1920, a young and unassuming Senator Burns( Peter Berinato) reads a telegram from his mother, Phoebe, and decides to change the course of American history in the Tennessee State House. Alice and Lucy await the final word at Suffragette Headquarters with a poignant tribute to a fallen  suffragette posted in one corner of the office.
 The celebration of their triumph is a sight to behold; the symbolic yellow stars of pro-suffrage fluttering from the balcony, and two best friends tossing their stylishly bobbed heads thither and yon in acknowledgement of the tribute.
 While there are a few inaccuarcies, Katja von Garnier's production is a beautiful tribute to Alice Paul in time for the 120th anniversary of her birth, as a timely one that could help decrease apathy among the American voters of today.",1118016000,4,4224,5.137226277372263

The entire cast does a good job here, although Patrick Dempsey's smirking takes away from his supposedly sympathetic character.

Only when the movie dispenses with the special effects does the story really come into its own. There is a wonderful moment of solidarity amongst the women as they sing ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken?"" in the dining hall and the final harrowing half hour with Swank being force fed in prison is not for the squeamish. Two-time Oscar winner Swank does an excellent job of conveying the abuses suffered in jail.  The negative points aside, this is a story that should be seen by everybody concerned about individual rights and freedoms.  The road to victory is not an easy one, and this film dovetails nicely with the events of today's America and the fight to retain our civil liberties.",1115596800,11,1136,4.780612244897959
2065085,4,B00026L9CU,"I rented this film mostly because I'm a huge fan of Frances O'Connor and want to see everything she's in.  She's my favorite actress, and I never fail to be impressed by her grace, humour and heart.  She always charms, and this role is no exception.  Hilary Swank was a pleasant surprise, as I've never seen any of her films, yet she shines in this one as Alice Paul--a pioneer in women's rights, forsaking love for a cause.  In one of the most profound lines I ever heard, she tells Lucy that as an individual, she has the right to make any choice she wants, but love would obligate her in a way that she would no longer have that choice because she'd be committed to what's best for the relationship.

This film surprised me by its very impressive cast...including Angelica Huston in some cool looking hats, Julia Ormond as the lady on the horse in their first march on Capitol Hill, and Patrick Dempsey as the Washington Post Reporter who falls for Alice Paul.  It was also nice to see President Woodrow Wilson onscreen and learn that things haven't changed so much in our country (for all our talk about freedom of speech, Americans truly are a censorous bunch when the person speaking raises uncomfortable questions about our commitments to what we claim to believe, as written in our Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights).

I really love the hip style of filmmaking the producers used to make history alive and exciting, with some interesting shots (particularly the 360-degree shot at the end of the film, the intercuts of people's speeches, etc) and some current music to drive home the beats (Lauryn Hill's ""Everything is Everythin"" and Vertical Horizon's one hit wonder song).  Historical purists might be alarmed and cry foul, but I think its a fresh touch for what might have easily been a ""boring period film"" shown on PBS or the BBC.  This film has modern sensibilities and was easily able to maintain my interest throughout.  This film stands as an example of how to make a historical film be interesting and fresh to a younger generation.

The scenes in prison were alarming, and all of it is new to me, as I never learned about any of this in high school or college history classes.  For that, I thank the filmmakers for bringing this topic to the screen.  I learned a lot and after watching this film, it makes me want to learn more.  That's the best that filmmakers can aim for.  All in all, a film worthy of being shown in high school history classes or required course assignments in college, discussed at length and to serve as an intro before diving into the subject of voting rights.  This film is an example that freedom is never given up by those in power.  At every step of the way, people must demand rights and not be afraid to pay the ultimate price for their demands.  This film deserves to serve as an inspiring call for any group that seeks to change our government to act in keeping with its words and founding principles.  If the people don't rise up and demand their rights be respected, no one else will.  History has shown it again and again, and this film is a perfect reminder of how far we've come...but also how much things haven't changed either.

2065086,4,B00026L9CU,"Hilary Swank has won the Academy Award (Boys Don't Cry) and is nominated this year (Million Dollar Baby).  However, her performance of Alice Paul in the HBO made for television movie, Iron Jawed Angels is as impressive as any work that she has previously done.  Other supporting actresses include Anjelica Huston, Julia Ormond, and Brooke Smith, along with Patrick Dempsey and Frances O'Connor.  They, too, add to a fantastic show.  Director Katja von Garnier beautifully captures the characters of these women.  Furthermore, the storyline is fast-paced and exciting

  The movie arouses deep thought and emotion.  ""Personally, I don't know how a woman could see this movie and not want to vote,"" said a female voter when she viewed it on Presidential Election Day 2004. The movie is about the lives of the 20th century suffragists with special focus on the radical, Alice Paul. After studying the subject well, I found the movie historically accurate in most areas.

 The film glorifies the women who went through hell to pave the way for today's young female voters.  It is important to note that the subject matter was not glossed over.  What I mean is that there are no rose-colored glasses to view through.  Hollywood glamour will not be seen here.  Because it was made for HBO rather than network television, the hellish scenes are cinematic nightmare sequences.  The scenes where the women are made to strip for searches and are force fed during a hunger strike are terribly graphic.  This makes the film too gory for very young viewers.  This is somewhat sad because young girls could be inspired by the film.  The suffragists that are in this film are not the sort that you see in ""Mary Poppins.""

 One item that brought concern for this critic was a question about the historical accuracy of the relationship between Dempsy's character and the character played by Swank.  This may have been added to give a love interest to the story line, but it seems unnecessary to the plot.  Moreover, Angelica Huston's character, Catt, is somewhat more villainous than the lobbyist might have been.  Many films have cast Huston in this sort of role, however in this particular instance, it was over the top.

 This film is a reminder that Susan B. Anthony did not work alone to insure the right to vote for women.  After viewing this film, I think every one of these women should have her face on an American coin.",1108512000,6,2412,4.819512195121951
2065087,4,B00026L9CU,"Too few women today realize just how much was sacrificed, as recently as the 20th century, for their right to vote. Even the greatest names among our foremothers are virtually unknown. Pearl S. Buck, one of the most popular novelists of the mid-twentieth century and the first woman to win both the Pulitzer and Nobel prizes for literature, wrote: ""In curiosity a few months ago I asked a haphazard score of women of my acquaintance if they had heard of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Only one had even heard her name, and she had no recollection of more. Yet only a generation ago Elizabeth Cady Stanton was called the greatest woman in the United States, and by some the greatest in the world.... [I]f the aim of education is to be enlightening of men and women about each other, of course history must be taught truthfully about both, and truthfully rewritten.""

This movie depicts the life of Alice Paul and her fellow suffragists during the last years of suffrage, including the violence used against them, the arrests and imprisonment, the infested food they were given to eat, the hunger strikes, the force-feedings, and their strength and courage in the face of hideous abuse. Most people have no idea how they suffered for our right to vote. (Even fewer know they opposed abortion, which Alice Paul called ""the ultimate exploitation of women."")  It is my hope that ""Iron Jawed Angels,"" though imperfect, will renew interest in the women's suffrage movement and its great heroes like Alice Paul and Inez Milholland Boissevain, ""Who Died for the Freedom of Women"" (as the classic memorial poster says).

""Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton & Susan B. Anthony"" (ASIN: B00008WI9Q) would make a great companion DVD to this one.

2065090,5,B00026L9CU,"Has HBO films just been on a roll lately, or what? From making the critically acclaimed and beautifully haunting miniseries ""Angels in America"", to the late Peter Sellers biopic, they seem to have cornered the market on creative, intellectually powerful films. Case in point: the beautifully haunting and critically acclaimed movie about the women's sufferage movement called ""Iron Jawed Angels"".

Recounting the desire to give women the right to vote, ""Iron Jawed Angels"" spans eight years in that divisive, poltically charged movement of people truly desiring equality. Played brilliantly by Hilary Swank, sufferagette Alice Paul becomes the powerhouse behind the movement, taking it from what was a more genteel group of women to one championing civil disobdience. Taking up the cause with her, Lucy Burns, played by Aussie actress Frances O'Connor, the two become an fiercesome force.

One thing that's amazing about this video is how little of a deal it is today that women vote. No one gives it a second thought. But back then, people were rioting over the fact that women wanted a voice in their own government. It makes me wonder how many causes today, when people look back 80 years from now, they will wonder what the big deal was at all.

Little has ever been taught about the price these women have paid in schools, but this video, and the contribution they have made should be taught across this country, period.",1102809600,18,1425,5.0042194092827
2065091,4,B00026L9CU,"This 2004 HBO movie depicts the struggles of the early suffragette movement, which eventually gave women in the United States the right to vote.  Spanning the years from 1912 to 1920, it stars Hilary Swank as Alice Paul who led the fight with ultimate courage.  There's some interesting history of which I was unaware.  And the filmmakers seem to get the theme across.  At the time, it was a state-by-state decision as to whether or not women could vote.  But Alice Paul wanted to make it a constitutional amendment.  There is, of course, is in-fighting in the movement itself with the old factions, led by Anjelica Huston, as Carrie Chapman Catt,  preferring to not make a fuss and quietly let each state decide.  Alice Paul, however, confronted the establishment head on and brought down some dour consequences on herself and the group of women who followed her lead.

At first I was annoyed at the film. I felt their wardrobes too lavish and the potential romance between Alice and a Washington Post cartoonist was silly.  I also thought the women seemed a bit too modern and politically correct.  And, frankly, I thought of turning off my DVD and never reviewing this film.

But then there was a scene in which the police turned their backs on protecting a festive parade in which women and children were demonstrating.  When the mobs attacked the women I felt real tears dripping down my face.  And then, later, when the women were horribly mistreated in prison, I found myself crying again, especially when they force-fed Alice Paul and we see them pushing tubes down her throat and through her nose. By the end of the film I understood exactly what these brave women had gone through in order to give me a privilege that I take for granted.  I also know that I have learned a new appreciation for my right to vote and will never take that right for granted again.

While not perfect, I applaud this film.  It brought me a new understanding.  It will bring it to you too.  Recommended.",1102723200,134,1991,4.653295128939828
2065092,3,B00026L9CU,"I have mixed feelings on Iron Jawed Angels. One the one hand, it tells the story of a very important (and relevant) moment in American history--the movement for national women's suffrage.

As a film, Iron Jawed Angels works. On first viewing it is very arresting (no pun intended) and involving. It is filled with great actresses and gets good turns from an aging Patrick Dempsey and a seemingly getting younger Bob Gunton (he sure didn't look this good a decade ago in The Shawshank Redemption).

Like most movies of this genre, the historical accuracy is slain on the altar of story-telling. In a story like Ms. Paul's this is unneccessary and annoying. This story has more than enough to it to carry a movie without any ""improvements.""

I can understand the poetic liscence with the voting at the end, but why must we make up a Senator and his wife to live this battle out in the microcosm of their family? It is tedious and steals the thunder of the history to have this man use his position to ""rescue"" these women.

One person did make a big fan of me in this movie. That was Frances O'Connor. She steals this film as Lucy Burns. My wife likes all the Austen flicks and I actually brought home The Importance of Being Earnest, so I have had the pleasure of watching Ms. O'Connor's work before, but she is at the top of her game in this film.

Unfortunately, on a second viewing of this film, she was one of very few things that held up twice. The soundtrack and cinematography that make the film grab you the first time around--to put it in a nice way--wear quickly.

The soundtrack in particular will date itself horribly in the next decade (an aside: my brother once said the same thing about the humor in Disney's Alladin. I thought he was splitting hairs back then, but man, was he right.)

So...now comes recommendation time: Iron Jawed Angels is a visually stunning and historically important movie. However, the visuals and the music get old fast and the history is, if not suspect, juiced up a bit.

Watch the movie and make up your own mind. Frances O'Connor's performance is worth a look, if nothing else.",1102723200,7,2121,4.563157894736842

This film depicts Alice Paul as the courageous and undaunted woman that she had to have been in order to persevere and fight for the woman's right to vote.  She is arrested without legal cause, jailed, grossly mistreated, force-fead, and interrogated in an attempt to prove her insane.

2065098,4,B00026L9CU,"I finally saw this whole movie! I was able to catch snips of it when it aired on HBO originally, but it wasn't until this weekend that I saw the whole thing. Three times, actually, plus a once-through of the commentary track with the director and screenwriter.

American cinema is usually quick to make movies about ""war heroes"", but much slower at pulling the trigger on our nation's heroes without guns... and even slower when those heroes are women. This is not a dull or overly dramatic movie about a long-overdue subject where the movie is just ho-hum but the topic makes it receive some sympathy points. This is a a great movie on its own.

I liked the fact that the music wasn't from the teens or twenties. Not because I don't like musics of that era (a search of my previous reviews will show that I do), but because alot of people do not. Having a more modern soundtrack will probably do a better job at drawing more people into the film. Plus, I think it also makes a subliminal connection between the past and the present. These events are by no means ""old"" history, and I think music from today may do a better job for most people of making them feel like we as a nation are still very much tied to the events caused by/surrounding these great women.

Beyond that, the movie shows them as humans, not as a cluster of no-personality drones who are always 100% serious and giving corny Hollywood-generica Hero Speeches. Also, they were not without flaw. In many director's hands, a movie of this topic very well may have ended up going that route, but here we get a great movie about the real events and real people that helped shape this nation... some of those people (the women) for better, and some (Woodrow Wilson & friends) for worse. Hopefully you already knew Wilson was garbage, but if not, this is a fine introduction to that fact.

There are many great performances here, but the whole thing hinges on Hilary Swank's performance, in my opinion. What an excellent choice she was! Having seen it, I can only hope that production of the movie would have been delayed had she  already been engaged in another project at the time. After this movie, no one can play Alice Paul again. Well, I guess someone could, but why?

Some don't like the music, which is music from today, and some don't like how it was filmed--again very contemporary.

2065103,5,B00026L9CU,"""Iron Jawed Angels"" dramatizes the last leg of the fight to win the right to vote for American women. It focuses on the work of young suffragettes Alice Paul (Hilary Swank) and Lucy Burns (Frances O'Conner) from their arrival in Washington, D.C. in 1912 until just before the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1920. Paul and Burns represented the younger generation of suffragettes who were less willing to bide their time playing politics until the nation's politicians came around to their way of thinking. They were brash, bold, brave and so self-righteous that they must have thought themselves invincible. But the time for extreme tactics had come, and even picketing President Woodrow Wilson during the US's involvement in World War I ultimately produced good results, though at a high price. ""Iron Jawed Angels"" follows Paul and Burns' fight for the vote through their atttention-stealing Inauguration Day parade in 1912, attempts to lobby Congress, their split with the National Women's Suffrage Association, formation of the National Women's Party, their 1916 cross-country trip to rally voters against any Democratic candidate who opposed a constitutional amendment giving women the vote, and their imprisonment for picketing a wartime president and subsequent hunger strike. There is constant strife between Alice Paul and the older generation of suffragettes, who are experienced in the ways of government and politically savvy, but disdain the obnoxious tactics that the younger generation embrace. Most notable of the older generation of suffragettes is Carrie Chapman Catt, played to perfection by Angelica Huston, who is imposing and clever, if old-fashioned.

Director Katja von Garnier has brought this story to life with a stellar cast and contemporary style. The film and sound editing are bold. The soundtrack is modern and upbeat. I questioned that decision when I first heard contemporary pop sounds pumping as Alice Paul crossed a street in 1912. But the style grew on me, and I came to appreciate the director's unconventional but oddly effective choices in scoring the film. The cast is great. Hilary Swank hits just the right note as Alice Paul -over and over again. I have never liked Frances O'Conner in anything, but she's perfect as Lucy Burns. It's a joy to hear Anjelica Huston speak as Carrie Chapman Catt, even if she is a stuffy character. Molly Parker gives perhaps the most emotionally affecting performance as Emily Leighton, wife of Senator Thomas Leighton, who supported the suffrage cause against her husband's wishes. Hers is an Oscar-calibre performance. Julia Ormond and Bob Gunton are also notable as suffragette Inez Mulholland and Pres. Woodrow Wilson, respectively. ""Iron Jawed Angels"" creatively and passionately presents the victory for women's suffrage and the story of those who fought and won it.

The DVD: There is an audio commentary by director Katja von Garnier and screenwriter Sally Robinson. The commentary is very casual and discusses filming and sound editing decisions and recounts a few anecdotes. It's honestly not very informative or interesting. No need to feel you missed anything if you skip it. Subtitles for the film are available in English, Spanish, and French.

2065108,5,B00026L9CU,"Only because Mary Poppins was released during the beginning of America's second wave of feminism was its `sister suffragettes' number inspiring during that film.

Yet the 1964 snippet of British suffrage tactics completely and convieniently overlooked their radical strategies in favor of bouncy and pert cheerleading which could otherwise found at a high school game. While acknowledging the need for women's rights, that same film also presented the women as pampered housewives who were really too busy for their families.

Thank goodness this HBO movie is much more realistic about the American-British radical suffrage struggle.

Alice Paul (Hillary Swank) and company may be conventionally attractive, but they are also not afraid to show how openly ticked off they are about being held to laws they cannot help form.

Much to the chagrin of the older `respectable' American suffragists (who want to wait for men to give them the vote), the British experience encourages demand for full sociopolitical equality. When they are jailed for their convictions, the women refuse to eat. By our modern expectations, the prison response (shown in graphic detail) is especially brutal.

For all of their progressive politics, Paul and company downplay race ironically in a time when such justice is most needed. Paul personally welcomes support of Delta Sigma Theta and other African American organizations, but worries their public presence will either undo or prevent the critical southern support necessary to winning suffrage. It is not easy to admit that our movement has an imperfect past, but it is important to ensuring a socially just future for all members. This conciousness is a marked improvement from days when even feminists themselves assumed their experiences applied for all women and race was a separate issue.

Another plus, this same movie recognizes men have always supported the suffrage movement not because they wanted a partner, already had one, or were lobbied until they had no other public choice---but out of similar social justice concern.

Again, earlier suffrage depictions (as with the larger feminist movement) erroneously claimed that the movement was all women. This more accurate historical picture may convince male viewers they have a similar obligation to work for the continuation of modern women's equality.  Other men will question their motives and some women will question their sincerity. But equality is really everybody's fight.

Attending a college, which was founded by many suffragists, the emphasis on women college graduates (then a statistical minority) was especially sobering. Despite our current knowledge of women's studies and gender theory, I don't think my generation (including myself) appreciates how fortunate we are when we would have been jeered at in earlier generations for receiving a college degree. After seeing this movie, I walked across my own campus trying to imagine some of the local townspeople (opposed to the idea of women receiving a college education in their town) threatening us on a near constant basis.

Precisely because Paul's Equal Rights Amendment was not ratified by the required states by the 1982 deadline, the film ends on a melancholy note. Paul's work remains half-finished and we have moral obligation to ensure the ERA becomes part of the constitution.

Hilary Swank is at her very best in this. There are scenes in this move that I still play over and over in my head. Every woman and girl in this country should see this movie. If they did they would never not vote again. Every man should see this movie - if they did they would ensure every woman in their lives saw it and and voted in every election. This is a definite must see!!!,1090022400,27,545,4.009174311926605

8023147,1,B00026L9CU,"I can tell you it is pathetic how horrible this movie is. It LITERALLY has a naked woman on it about women's suffrage!?!? MAKES NO SENSE!  The whole film fallows that same ""theme"".

If you want to watch a real movie about women's suffrage watch Suffragette.",1519603200,,257,4.565217391304348

8023152,5,B00026L9CU,Great film!  I show this to my women's history students as well as students in my US history 2 courses when we are covering the women's suffrage movement.  The students seem to enjoy it quite a bit and there are tons of free online worksheets and viewing guides.  It really puts a human face on the struggles that women experienced in order to gain the vote and a public voice.,1509408000,2,377,4.357142857142857
