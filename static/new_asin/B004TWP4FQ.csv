4466077,5,B004TWP4FQ,"Adam's vocals on this sound ALMOST as good as his live performances do...I was amazed that the sound is so true.
Love that it's both a CD & DVD.
Adam's Glam Nation Tour was the concert of a lifetime, and it is super to have this record of one concert. Since he changed it up with every show, each event was unique. For those who were not able to attend a GNT concert, this is a must. Yes, you missed it,but get ready now form the next one! I can not wait!",1320451200,,455,3.9565217391304346
4466078,5,B004TWP4FQ,"As close as one can get to being at the concert.
Very very happy not having to use U Tube to watch and listen
Adam is simply the very best entertainer of our day bar none",1306713600,,170,3.75
4466079,5,B004TWP4FQ,"Awesome concert! Huge Adam Lambert fan, I enjoyed the concert. People's concern with the videography should be taken in the context of the director going for a different look. The DVD director, Doug Spangenberg, used 11 cameras and 9 operators and had concerns about the lasers' position (relative to the cameras) - however it was the Director's decision to position the cameras where he did and use the angles he did, as well as the coloring. While you may not like his vision, it is his vision and his alone, including video effects which are intended to bring out the best from the concert. I have both versions of the DVD (regular and Blue Ray) and have gifted several copies to friends, who in terns were delighted by the concert and dumbstruck by the power of Adam's voice. Go ahead, get your copy and you wont' regret it!",1305590400,7,828,4.601351351351352
4466080,5,B004TWP4FQ,"I attended Adam's Glamnation concert in DC in a small overly packed club.  This DVD enabled me to experience more of the concert atmosphere than I was able to have at the club.  Loved the different angles that were taken of Adam, his band, and his dancers.  It captured the excitement of the crowd and made me feel like I was actually there again.  The sound was right on the money and Adam's voice never sounded better.  I enjoyed the contrast of the black and white shots with the colors because it gave you another feel for the performance.  The colors are so vivid the black and white helps you to zone in on Adam and the performers.  The crowd shots were quick but enough to understand the connection he was making with his audience.  I have the regular DVD and the Blu-Ray.  Both have their positive points--both are superb.  I am so glad I have these as memories of an unforgettable night.",1305590400,4,896,4.441717791411043
4466081,5,B004TWP4FQ,"This concert is fantastic.  The music/vocals are sensational and the performance mesmerizing.  If you attended a concert then it will take you back to that magical experience.  If you were unfortunate enough NOT to have attended a concert then this GNL Blu-ray will ensure you don't miss out on the next tour.

4466082,1,B004TWP4FQ,"I am a huge AL fan so I was really looking forward to this BD. I should have previewed the regular DVD that came with the CD because if I had I would have definitely skipped this 'supposed' high definition copy. First, the videographers were horrible. I've seen better amateur videos posted on you tube. If I am watching a professionally shot video of a concert I do not expect to see heads blocking my view (this happens many many times throughout). Next, the switching back and forth between the black and white and color was distracting (again, this happens many many times throughout). And what's with the rear camera shots (a few times ok but again, happens many many times throughout). Do I want to see the audience or do I want to see Adam performing. The editing on this is also terrible. The constant panning back and forth, with disjointed angles is distracting. Lastly, the fact that they call this a high definition video is laughable. I've seen regular DVDs upconvert better than this BD. It's a shame how horrible the quality of this BD is. Don't get me wrong - Adam gave a great concert, but don't waste your $$ on this BD. Just stick with the free DVD that comes with the CD.",1305331200,16,1191,4.493087557603687

8441023,1,B004TWP4FQ,"Some creep stalked me and pointed out that I had written a few reviews for his Adam that he didn't agree with...so this is for my stalker...I hope you like this review. Adam is a potential talent but his taste in music is just not nearly as good as his voice. The make-up, hair, and raunchiness are too theatrical for him to be taken seriously.",1434672000,,344,4.3076923076923075

8441025,5,B004TWP4FQ,"This was Adam's first tour and I'm sure that explains the small unimpressive stage. That being said, I love this concert! I may be biased because I love Adam Lambert with all my heart lol but I can enjoy this concert (and even my grandmother begs me to play it from time to time) I now even play this concert and reminisce. I previously owned this on DVD so the upgrade to Blu-ray was a huge sigh of relief.",1424908800,,407,4.1645569620253164

8441027,5,B004TWP4FQ,"If it were possible for David Bowie and Barry Manolow to have a son, it would be Adam. Adam has his own unique style and good looks of a  Bowie, and the showmanship,  work ethic, and connection with audience of Manolow.  We have just scratched the surface of what Lambert can do.",1414281600,,279,4.326923076923077

8441029,5,B004TWP4FQ,I miss GNT so much and this DVD makes me happy to remember the good times of GNT in HD.  I have the one with CD/DVD also and I listen to The CD in my car.  Adam's live voice is out of this world and these GNT CD/DVD & Blu-Ray discs captured the essence of Adam extraordinary GNT live performance.  Every fan should have them.,1339977600,,325,3.9692307692307693
8441030,4,B004TWP4FQ,"I don't like the way this was shot, but I did want the official record of the tour on blu-ray. Great quality. Just no closeups of one of the most beautiful creatures on the planet, IMHO. Cos2mwiz, Suz526, Libracats, Anthrogeek...many others on YouTube did a great job of capturing the feel of the tour. Especially cos2mwiz. She shot tight and close and you can really appreciate his expressive face. Now if we could just get this type of audio and video clarity in the hands of his fans...Oh, well. The blu ray is worth purchasing.",1326067200,,531,4.6
8441031,5,B004TWP4FQ,"Given the low budget an artist has on his first tour, Adam did an oustanding job with the Glam Nation Tour and it's amazing there's a Blu-ray at all.  I saw it live.  The video doesn't do it justice visually, but the sound is incredible!  If you saw the tour, this is an excellent keepsake.  If you didn't see it, this will give you an idea of what you missed.",1321401600,,360,4.1
