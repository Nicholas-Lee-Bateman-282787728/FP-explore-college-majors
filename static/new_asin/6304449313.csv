I have never seen a production, live or on film, that lives and breathes and moves as clearly and well as this.  It moves quickly, with  great directing so there's no stiffness, no difficulty in interpretation or  timing, this is the smoothest and least artificial interpretation of the  Bard I've yet seen.",911779200,2,385,4.7727272727272725

886139,5,6304449313,"This is a wonderful adaptation of Shakespeare's play.  My favorite is Sir Ben Kingsley as Feste.  However, each of the actors and actresses were phenomenal.  ""Oh mistress mine, where are you roaming?""

The physical comedy of a woman playing a man dueling another man for the love of a woman was hilarious.",1482364800,,305,4.8076923076923075

886179,5,6304449313,One of Shakespeare's best and a great combination of players bring this comedy to life. Never has Shakespeare been so enjoyable. A pair of twins are lost at sea. Each washes ashore in a different place and thinks the other is lost. The girl twin pretends to be her brother twin because a woman should not be travelling alone. She meets and falls for a baron and joins his service acting as his representative in wooing Olivia. Olivia does not care for the baron but falls for the woman she thinks is Sebastian. Sebastian arrives and fall for Olivia. Meanwhile the servants and Olivia's uncle are creating chaos by urging a candidate of their own to woo Olivia while at the same time plotting disaster for Olivia's main household servant by giving him hopes that Olivia returns his amorous feelings. Riotous comedy.,1476835200,2,814,4.73943661971831

886235,1,6304449313,Badly bowdlerized version of great comedy. Scenes shortened and out of order important speeches cut off. Trevor Nun should be ashamed,1469318400,,133,5.380952380952381

886238,5,6304449313,"Perhaps the best film ever made of this play. The director was artistic director at the Royal Shakespeare Company, and he keeps the action moving. Also, the actors speak their lines like they mean something, which is hard because Shakespeare's dialogue is now archaic.

This film ultimately inspired my Master's thesis in Women's Studies, 9 years after I saw it, which shows how much it and this play mean to me.",1467244800,,412,4.802816901408451
886239,5,6304449313,"Brilliant. The performances are all spot on. The little easter egg touches in this Victorian setting of Twelfth Night are delightful - Sebastian consulting a copy of Baedeker's Illyria in one shot is my favorite. The score - background music interweaving with Shakespeare's use of song throughout the play (Come Away Death, Oh Mistress Mine, the opening sequence on piano that cues Orsino's iconic ""If music be the food of love..."" line) is both clever and very beautiful.",1466812800,,472,5.064102564102564

886320,4,6304449313,"This adaptation of Twelfth Night is pretty sappy, but it's still fun to watch, mainly because of the casting.  Nunn does a good job of cutting between scenes to keep the action moving, but sometimes uses visuals at the expense of dialogue, so if you really love Shakespeare's language, you may be a bit frustrated at the quantity he leaves out.  He displays the gender-bending in a less comic way, so it's not as farcical as it should be, and his decision to start the movie with Viola and Sebastian dressing alike, with Antonio looking on, makes the play's denouement stupid.",1455062400,,576,4.693069306930693
886321,5,6304449313,"This is a very well-made and entertaining movie. A few years ago I taught a little Shakespeare at a private school, and this Twelfth Night video was great because the edgy subject matter was interesting to the teenage students. Some scenes brought on laughter from the students.",1454544000,,278,4.9361702127659575
886322,5,6304449313,"One of my favorite Shakespeare renditions, the twins look amazingly alike.  Great actors, and good musical score as well!",1454198400,,121,5.368421052631579
886323,2,6304449313,"As a motion picture, this is forgettable. As ""Shakespeare on screen"" it is lamentable, as probably only 40% of the text of the play is included. And the words are often hard to hear, whether due to slurred delivery or having to try to strain to hear them over background noises like the sea or birds. If it makes viewers want to go to Shakespeare and learn more about the text, I can see that as a positive. If you want a much better introduction to this work by Shakespeare, try the 2008 film version with Alec Guinness, The Thames Shakespeare Collection: Twelfth Night (with Kenneth Branagh), or the Globe on Film version. They are all different productions, giving different emphases to different  aspects.",1453680000,,709,4.717741935483871

886325,5,6304449313,"Much Ado About Nothing is my favorite, with Twelth Night a close second.

I thought i bought the dvd!  Where is it?",1453507200,,115,4.181818181818182
886326,5,6304449313,"I LOVE this movie! I'm a big Shakespeare fan, and 12th Night is my all time favorite Shakespeare comedy. The way that this movie was done, is not only a credit to the original piece, but they even improved on it! I'm very much a stickler for ORIGINAL TEXT. I hate it when the original text of the play is edited or modernized. I really dislike (but understand) when they edit out parts of the play. From my memory, I would say that there is a very minimum of editing out in this version... and the additions they made, which normally I would object to, really did add to the play. They also re-arranged a few scenes, keeping the text, and that ALSO worked to the advantage of the play.

Now, even though 12th Night is my favorite... I am fully aware of how unbelievable the ending can be most of the time it's done. It's just not believable. This film makes it 100% believable. It's 100% acceptable for the ending to be plausible, because of the way the scenes were done and the extra physical elements that were added. If you know the play, you know exactly what I'm talking about. If you don't, I don't want to spoil it, but trust me, you need to see it. If you need more information, the fact that a woman is pretending to be a man, and falls in love with another man (who falls in love with her, thinking that she is male... but being straight...) there is that tension and desire with confusion that really SHOULD be there, but is not written in the text. That is what makes this movie great.

My favorite character of the play/film has always been the fool, played by Ben Kingsley. May I just say that Ben Kingsley is the BEST actor I have EVER seen in this role. The character of the fool in this play was specifically written by Shakespeare for the actor (of his day) to play. This was a new (then) concept of the wise fool. This fool does not do physical or low comedy, but is the ONLY character in the entire play who is not some kind of unintentional fool. This fool is where all the wisdom comes from. He's the only character who knows exactly what is going on, but allows everything to happen as it will. So often this character is not grasped by those playing it, or they have trouble playing it. It takes actual wit and cleverness to really pull off this character and Ben Kingsley has that. He's masterful in the role and truly inspiring. If you want an example of the ALL TIME best performance of this character, this is IT! So, of course, this being my favorite character in my favorite play, the fact that he does the role perfectly makes it absolutely fantastic for me.

All of the acting is excellent! ALL of it! When Viola is sacrificing her physical self, both temporarily (losing her lovely hair) and permanently (destroying her voice) for her role as a boy, it's heartbreaking. Her love is very real. The love Sebastian has for Antonio and vice versa is very much felt. The pompous attitude, forbidden lust and later, the complete downfall of Malvolio is both hilarious and enthralling. Sir Toby Belch and Maria are also believable and funny in their plotting and romance. The much used Sir Andrew Aguecheek is over-the-top -but in a perfect way! I adored the little bit they threw in there costume-wise for him. Orsino and Olivia are both characters where their love should not and (sadly, in most productions) never is honestly believable in the end, but for this film it is 100% believable and set up for complete success by the director and the actions of the actors. Sure, she's married a total stranger, but we get the feeling that it'll all be ok, BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONS! If we'd not seen that first scene where they made that relationship of the twins come alive for us and we knew their bond, their love and their spirit, it just wouldn't be the same.

So if you've not seen it yet, GET IT AND SEE IT NOW!",1452988800,4,3841,4.405633802816902
886327,3,6304449313,One of my favorite films. Love this play. The movie does the screen play justice to a point. The ending is so campy. Over look that and you will get a laugh or two.,1449100800,,164,3.8529411764705883

886348,5,6304449313,"This film interpretation is just lovely--and unexpectedly moving.  I've used this film in class while reading the Shakespearean text with high school students with great success.  Imogen Stubbs handles Viola/Cesario with convincing humanity, never sliding into caricature or camp.  The location shoot, the lush score, and the relocation in setting give the film a curiously nostalgic quality, an unexpected bonus.  Ben Kingsley as Feste and Richard E. Grant as Sir Andrew both inject their normally flat characters with a complexity easily overlooked in the reading.  No easy feat.  Well done and well worth your time.",1447113600,2,618,5.4526315789473685

886351,1,6304449313,"I know that it's my fault for not noticing, but this was for PAL systems (what they use in places like Hong Kong) and not NTSC (what we use in America).  That should labeled pretty big.  I was unable to play it.  That was pretty annoying.  Again, I know I should've looked more carefully, but I assume when I'm buying something from Amazon in America that I don't need to check to make sure it will work on American devices.",1446681600,,424,4.2625

It is clearly pointed out so it was all on me for not reading it. This was the first time I should have paid attention to the description. When I got it, I was disappointed that I couldn't watch it, but I talked with a friend and she told me that many new DVD players now play other regions. Yay! I was wanting to get a new one since my old one sounds like it's dying anyways. I found one on Amazon that is the same price as I paid for my old one and this solves my mistake...just as soon as I can afford to replace it ;)",1446336000,,679,3.857142857142857

I gave it a few chances but couldn't ever get passed the scene where the house servants are up late at night partying.  Now, this is a great play, maybe Shakespeare's greatest comedy, and there have been some excellent productions of it on the stage, both on the small stage (saw a memorable one in Monmouth Maine in the 80s) and the big (Delacorte NYC in the 00s).

This one is a bloated drag, that does its best to miss what marks it can along the way, and easy marks.  Viola is coming onto Olivia and their lips nearly touch, on their first meeting.  No impassioned attempt to bring Olivia's attention to Count Orsino.  No, no, he's long forgotten.  It's the gay era of movie making and the gay element is appropriately played up.  Subtlety, none of that.  Meat fist and clever.  Malvolio isn't cast as some pernicious up-start political type trying to kiss up the boss for a rapid gain to fame.  He's an old farty has-been.  There's no tension here.  The plot's wheels have come off.

And then, to make sure they stay off, the drippy performance is buried under an overwrought badly tempered soundtrack.  It's as though they say Branaugh's Much Ado About Nothing and tried to pull that off by a half-dead Politically Correct manifesto and some old hack BBC actors, costumes, and of course that enobling English accent which covers up all woes.

It's too bad, I hope the media machine finally gets around to doing this play right.  It's great, great material.  It's sad this is the most representative work for it on the dvd market.",1430611200,2,1611,4.56993006993007

886643,5,6304449313,"All movie adaptations of Shakespeares plays face the same challenge, i.e., which scenes to be cut off and which plots gaps to be filled-in. The movie directors usually fill the gaps with their own fragmented interpretations, which are based on personal views or favourite themes. Trevor Nunns adaptation of Twelfth Night, however, is quite unique in its accuracy. The invented scenes are correct and they accurately represent the original intention of the play. For example, having Feste witnessing the landing of Viola in Illyria helps the audience to comprehend the plot. Indeed, Feste directs the entire process that is illustrated in the play. Therefore, from the very beginning he knows who Viola and Sebastian are and what their respective roles are. It is their arrival in Illyria that prompts Feste to return to Olivias house.

There is only one detail that does not reflect correctly the situation of Illyria. Namely, it is not possible for Illyria to be at war with Messaline, i.e., the place from which the twins Viola and Sebastian have been sent. Messaline is an imaginary place and, in accordance with Shakespeares symbols, represents a higher state that operates beyond limitations of time and space (like Pentapolis in Pericles, Prince of Tyre, Mauritania in Othello, or the Fairy Kingdom in A Midsummer Nights Dream). In other words, Messaline is beyond Illyrias reach. It is there that the future events are designed and then projected down for their earthly actualization.",1386288000,,1491,5.161157024793388

When it was still impossible to purchase Twelfth Night in any format, let alone on DVD, our family borrowed the VHS tape from the library about every 6 months. My grade school aged children (whose taste in movies is admittedly precocious) embraced this production of Shakespeare's romantic comedy wholeheartedly. The cast is fantastic, the story line and dialogue are clear, the chemistry between the characters is believable.
Even now, I cannot watch ""Shakespeare in Love"" without feeling compelled to follow it with Twelfth Night. ""It will be a love story. For she will be my heroine for all time. And her name will be Viola.""",1378252800,,690,4.956896551724138

The second is I've seen a bit of this on Bravo years ago and became curious about it ever since. So after seeing it for the first time from start to finish, I can honestly say that this is one of the best film adaptations of a Shakespearean play that I have ever seen. The scenery and costumes are gorgeous, the plot is faithful to the original play, and the acting is excellent.

Imogene Stubbs and Helena Bonham Carter give breathtaking performances and foil well of of each other and the corresponding members of the film's cast. In all of my viewing experience there has never been a better Sir Toby Belch or Feste than Mel Smith and Ben Kingsley.

--what moves me again and again are the multiple portraits of yearning and desire in shakespeare's writing realized so beautifully by the cast (and, omg, what a cast!)--the act ii duke-and-viola material is chopped up and deployed in different places down the time-line (you can do that in a movie, have a 1-minute scene in another-part-of-the-forest) and we get a sense of viola really falling in love with the duke over time--so about the middle of the movie we come to ""what's her history?"" ""a blank, my lord, she never told her love..."" and viola's brief, gorgeous monologue still moves me to tears (oh god, the worm in the rose), and when imogen stubbs delivers it it's clearly  a matter of intense personal yearning and desire, heartfelt and earned

--yearning and desire: that's 12th night--yearning and desire reveal us as persons, and put us at risk of big disappointment, and all those persons are realized by shakespeare (and who of us doesn't feel a pang for malvolio and his no-way-man yearning and desire)--but how splendidly varied are the roles in this casting!--everybody's a star in every way, and beautiful, so full of the different sorts of yearning and desire

--the music!--there's a music cue in the form of this kind of fluttering tremble in the high violins, and it occurs when somebody in the story is suddenly, unpremeditatedly getting hot for another character: viola goes blankly slack-jawed staring at the duke (music cue), the countess does a little double-take on viola a couple minutes into their first meeting (music cue)

""A while ago the world began,
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
But that's all one, our play is done,
And we'll strive to please you every day.""

The above are the last words spoken (actually sung) in this well-acted movie based on William Shakespeare's (1564 to 1616) last romantic comedic play of the same name (written circa 1600).

With a lavish estate, plenty of amorous encounters, upper class--lower class plotting, and two cases of mistaken identity, this movie is like a house party where no one goes home.  However, there is something sweetly sad, unsettling, and even bitter about this movie.

Both this movie and the play are festive but they also dabble in madness, despair, sexual ambiguity, and even cruelty.

The play is about love and grief, their pains and their pleasures, and how the two emotions are often difficult to distinguish.  This movie captures all this quite well.

This movie features an all-star cast with perhaps Helena Bonham Carter (as the rich countess Olivia ""of beauty truly blent"") and Ben Kingsley (as her clownish sometimes singing ""allowed fool"" named ""Feste"") being the most identifiable.  All the actors do good jobs in their roles but both Imogen Stubbs (as the very female Viola turned male ""page"" Cesario) and Nigel Hawthorne (as Olivia's self-loving attendant Malvolio) do, in my opinion, outstanding jobs in their roles.

Note that this movie trims down Shakespeare's original play.  This had to be done or this movie would have been way too long.  This movie also updates the play costume-wise to the late nineteenth century.

The background music & cinematography are beautiful and add to each scene.

Finally, the DVD released in 2005 has no subtitles or closed-captioning.  However, it does have a few extras.  I also noticed that on the DVD case, the movie has the title ""Twelfth Night.""  However, the opening credits tell us that its real title is ""Twelfth Night or What You Will.""

Bottom-line:

This movie is a worthy addition to William Shakespeare's cinematic canon.

In Shakespeare's time women actors were not permitted on the stage. Their roles were usually played by boys or men who could do high pitched tones. You can imagine therefore the dramatic tension that can be created by a somewhat gender bending role, and what that can add to certain romantic situations.

So when a young lady, Viola, and her twin brother, Cesario, get shipwrecked, she washes up alone on the hostile shores of Illyria, where the Duke of Orsino does not allow women in court because he only has eyes for the Duchess. Adopting the guise of the brother she gains the Duke's trust, and he asks her to woo the Duchess in his name. Unfortunately, the Duchess has recently also lost her brother, and sworn off men for seven years.

The Duchess falls in love with Viola as a man, while Viola falls in love with the Duke as a woman, setting up a complicated romantic triangle. Meanwhile, Malvolio literally means ill will, we have music with Ben Kingsley as Feste the clown, and an attempt to mislead the melancholic Malvolio in the ways of love, and a mysterious anonymous message lending farcical elements. You wonder if Viola's brother might have miraculously survived the shipwreck.

In my opinion Imogen Stubbs does an excellent job doing double duty, and Helen Bonham Carter steals the show in every scene. Her facial expressions are priceless.

As a Shakespeare production I have to give Trevor Nunn top marks for delivering a beautiful setting, developing the tension very well, and for the license he takes with the scenes, I particularly like that the twins were a singing duo, and the bath scene. Ben Kingsley's experience and presence as a Shakesperean actor shows through in every scene.

Perhaps best considered as part of a trio of plays including As You Like It, with which it has the thematic similarity of a woman in disguise as a man, and Much Ado About Nothing, a romantic comedy set in Messina.

Twelfth night features the famous saying: Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.

I consider this one of the best renditions of Shakespeare to screen, and if you get a chance, I particularly recommend you check out Zeffirellis&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-Juliet/dp/0792165055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo & Juliet</a>&nbsp;(Widescreen) starring Olivia Hussey. Sublime.

I have also seen an earlier version of TN with Joan Plowright in the role of Viola, and Alec Guinnes as Malvolio. Unlike this modern version JP looks the same as either a man or a woman, and while she is a good actress, I estimate she may have been about 50 when playing the part, which is probably more suited to a woman in her early 20s like Imogen Stubbs. That version while quite good made me appreciate the dynamism of this one more. It's not just a great play, now it's a great movie.

You will laugh, you will be moved, you will pity Malvoleo while disliking him, and you will recognize the many poetic phrases that Shakespeare invented for the play and that have entered normal speech.  My daughter at 15 loves this play and has it practically memorised, and it even entices her brother (11) to listen and enjoy some of it.

So far as the play goes, I have never quite been able to believe that fraternal twins, a boy and girl, could be mistaken for oneanother, but it is fiction afterall.  The story is very fun:  twins lost in a ship wreak and washed ashore, are seeking to make their way in an aristocratic society.  The girl poses as a man, gaining access to a world of gallant men, to whom she listens and learns, all while a countess is falling for her and not the man she represents.  It is wonderfully hilarious gender-bending stuff from another epoch, never over the top or sexual, but always witty and ironic.  The countess' drunken uncle and his hapless sidekick are also great fun, particularly when affronted by an affair of honor.  The comic situations, as there are apparently two handsome boys, are wonderfully done, believable yet hilarious.  Indeed, this is one of the best film versions of Shakespeare I have ever seen.

886870,4,6304449313,"I do not usually comment on Shakespearean plays, yet because this adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night"" is set in the Victorian period, I thought I would comment.

1.
This adaptation contains good acting and more elaborate sets than any other adaptation of ""Twelfth Night"" I have ever seen. The picture quality is also good (considering this adaptation was produced for a wide-range of viewers rather than merely aficionados of William Shakespeare's plays).

2.
The adaptation is pretty loyal to the original play. Of course, there are some deviations such as when Malvolio rides a bicycle in pursuit of Cesario (which is entirely against Malvolio's personality, even when set in the Victorian period), not to mention that it is still a little early for the type of bicycle Malvolio rode.

3.
I thought the 'romantic' scenes were effective. Unlike some adaptations, this Cesario actually looks like she could be male (rather than a female actor dressed up). Of course, when Shakespeare plays were originally produced, male actors played the female parts.

Final thoughts:
I think this adaptation is worth watching. I enjoyed watching it. I especially thought Ben Kingley as Feste played his part well. (PS: Feste is given a larger role in this film adaptation than he would have been in an actual rendition of William Shakespeare's ""Twelfth Night.""",1258761600,4,1362,5.177272727272728
886871,4,6304449313,"Although I am a Shakespeare scholar, I am not what one might call a ""purist"".  That is, I can enjoy film adaptations of Shakespeare's plays which do not include every word of the text, which rearrange lines and/or leave out dozens of lines at a time.  Such an adaptation is Trevor Nunn's.  He even includes Shakespeare-LIKE added dialogue at the beginning of the film along with scenes which Shakespeare did not write, since, unfortunately, Shakespeare did not have the advatage of cinema.  A professor once told me that Shakespeare would have loved film, especially for Antony and Cleopatra, which jumps back and forth frequently between Alexandria and Rome.  The same may be said of Twelfth Night, which ""cuts"" from various outdoor settings in Illyria to Orsino's dwelling to Olivia's house to Olivia's grounds.  Trevor Nunn's adaptation takes full advantage of these cinemamatic advantages.

I have one quibble, however, and it is considerable.  I know that actors in a film should not ""declaim"", in stagey deliveries of lines from plays, especially Shakespeare's.  However, I do expect the speeches, however ""naturally"" they are delivered to be intelligible, at audible volume.  Such, it seemed to me, is not always the case with Nunn's adaptation.  Actors often mumble or practically whisper their lines (especially true of Helena Bonham Carter), and if I were not familiar with the play, I would have no idea of what they are saying.  I find it disappointing that the director should not have noted this during the rushes (or whenever) and sharpened the delivery so that more of Shakespeare's irreplaceable lines could be distinctly heard and understood.

However, Trevor Nunn's film of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is remarkably successful in most instances, and this is largely due to the perfect casting.",1251417600,5,1812,5.185567010309279

That earlier world's own metaphysical investment in the mystical union of opposites parallels Shakespeare's preoccupation with the double marriage. By merging these worlds and their symbols - the Shakespearean and the Celtic, the textual and the visual - so seamlessly together Nunn and his superlative team bring manna to starved souls.",1245715200,,658,5.656565656565657

This is a very well-done Shakespeare on-screen production.  While plays are all well & good, there is something to be said to seeing Shakespeare filmed outside, inside of castles & w/lavish sets.  While some purists may not like it, I think it's good for his plays to be displayed thus.

The acting in this film is top-notch.  You can never go wrong w/Ben Kingsley, and he is stellar as the sort of ""rudder"" character of the story.

Ben Kingsley's Feste is a wise man with a powerful intellect and acts as the presiding consciousness of Illyria.  Olivia, Viola and Sebastion are all excellent. Sir Andrew emerges as a rather sad but very real personality.  Antonio's obsessive love for Sebastian arouses compassion.  As a result the comedy is less rousingly slapstick than one sometimes finds, but this makes it possibly for the more subtle comedy of language to come through.
  Its setting in Victorian times is completely convincing and provides many comedic details.  Sir Andrew with his neck caught under a croquet hoop is a very telling and hilarious example.  My only reservation is about Orsino, whose initial  appearance  with a lip-curling eye-tooth flashing sneer is difficult to forgive or forget - but he improves quite soon.

Sometimes this can be a cruel thing and not stereotypically funny. If you think I'm wrong, all you need to do is look at Feste's first scene in which he is telling Olivia she is a fool to mourn her brother to the extent she does, since he in in heaven and doesn't need her sympathy.  Is this something to laugh out loud at? No. Is it funny? In a way and convinces Olivia to keep Feste around.

There is perfect time taken to put real emotion behind the lines. The characters feel more real than any other Shakespeare I recall seeing performed, either in stage or film. The acting is simply excellent, and the actors are clearly picked to match this style of realism.

The realism goes so far, however, as to ruin many of the laughs. It's like we're not being allowed to get in on the joke. Even when the characters are laughing, I wasn't coaxed into laughing myself. It seems to be designed so that we are looking in on foolish people, but with pity instead of humor. The biggest example fo this is the casting and directing of Ben Kingsley as Feste, who instead of a jester, plays some kind of a wise truth-saying guy. Not only does it destroy him as a comedic character, it makes you spend the movie wonder what he's doing there.

There is a relationship between twins that is very poinyant during the beginning and at the end of the film that Imogen had part into that is worth noting.",1173312000,2,1089,4.447236180904523
886976,4,6304449313,"""Twelfth Night"" may be one of Shakespeare's lesser known plays but this production really hit it with my entire family - even my two sons, ages 15 and 11, loved it!  The trailer/teaser for the movie played up the gender-bender aspects of the plot but don't be misled - there's nothing gay about this movie.  ""Twelfth Night"" is all about mistaken identity, wistful and fruitless love, and runaway egos.  All's well that ends well, and all does.  Ben Kingsley as Feste is my favorite character, and his song at the movie's close really wraps things up well.  He, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Nigel Hawthorne are the best known members of what proved to be a very good cast.  So, why not 5 stars???  I am profoundly deaf.  The first time I saw this movie, it was on VHS with poor-to-average closed captioning.  I so looked forward to seeing it on DVD.  The DVD version that I purchased is NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED!  What's with that!  Just copy the text from Shakespeare's play and add it to the DVD!  I simply cannot believe that this is happening in the 21st Century.

Acclaimed director Trevor Nunn's film is a classic adaptation of the third of Shakespeare's mature comedies (the others being Much Ado and As You Like It).  Twelfth Night is the darkest of these three plays, beginning with Orsino's famous opening soliloquy and continuing its conflicted heroines, the cross-dressing Viola (Imogen Stubbs) and the moody Olivia (Helena Bonham Carter), both of whom are mourning lost brothers.  The puritan steward, Malvolio--played masterfully by Nigel Hawthorne, whose appearance recalls famous Malvolios from play posters of bygone eras--is seething with sexual frustration, revealed only when tricked into it via a letter supposedly written by Olivia, yet penned by the tricky servant, Maria (Imelda Staunton).  Maria's plotline is wonderfully augmented in this film by the clowns, Sir Toby Belch (Mel Smith), Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Richard E. Grant), and Feste (Ben Kingsley).

Nunn's adaptation is distinctive in three ways:

1.  his realignment of scenes to emphasize similarities in seemingly disparate circumstances (e.g. the theme of madness, wherein Viola's lost brother Sebastian (Steven MacIntosh) wonders if he is mad even as Malvolio has a nervous breakdown in the dark room).  The cuts he makes in the original text are equally appropriate to the change of medium:  the story is essentially intact, with an opening non-Shakespearean twist that emphasizes shipwreck as the originating event.

2.  Ben Kingsley's emphasis on the revenge motivating Feste--the fact that this seemingly merry fool has a thin skin when Malvolio upbraids him, and lords it over the broken steward at the end of the play.  Though this darker interpretation of Malvolio is not the usual happy-go-lucky goof seen too often on North American stages, the text itself does warrant this way of seeing him, and it gives the character much more complexity.

3.  The homoerotic attraction between Duke Orsino (Toby Stevens) and Cesario (Viola in disguise)--again, warranted by the text itself--is more fully developed than in many productions, and again, it increases the complexity of Orsino's character even as it emphasizes Viola's intense desire for him even as she is unable to break out of the identity she has created for herself in Orsino's court.

Beyond all this, the film is lush in its use of color, its landscapes and interiors--a delight to anyone who understands and appreciates the complexities of Shakespeare's characters.  One only wishes Nunn would continue making films of this sort.  I'm waiting for a good adaptation of The Tempest!",1171411200,14,2593,5.4264339152119705

I totally concur with the other reviewers who have rated this so highly, along with Ken B's gorgeous Much Ado, for example. I bought this based on the cast alone, but to be honest, it even exceeded my expectations.

Just as Shakespeare played around with gender/androgyny in As You Like It, in which Rosalind cross-dressed in order to gain information etc. he excels in Twelfth Night by also adding twins into the mix - he was the father of twins, himself.

I really cannot recommend this delightful and hilarious production highly enough.

887058,4,6304449313,"This is in many ways a terrific film adaptation of Shakespear's ""Twelfth Night"". The casting is superb - Helena Bonham-Carter is exquisite as Olivia, Imelda Staunton is nothing less than superb as Viola-playing-Cesario, and the Duke is played as a suitably self-dramatising and lachrymose young man with excellent qualities underneath all of that. The fool is interestingly played by Ben Kingsley - I must say, I'd expected more the traditional sort of Fool, but Mr Kingsley plays it almost straight. Such is his brilliant talent that he gets away with it.

The other parts - Viola's twin Sebastian, the grave and conceited Malvolio (a lovely performance by Nigel Hawthorne), a not-very-bright Sir Andrew Aguecheek and a riotous Sir Toby - are extremely well played. Everyone looks wonderful - the settings are magnificent - the costumes work very well.

There are two reasons why I do not give this DVD 5 stars. Firstly, I thought the midnight revels as instigated by Sir Toby were a little over the top, what with smashing glasses and bawling out songs at top voice in the middle of the night. And secondly, there was a tad too much chopping of lines. This was particularly noticeable in what was originally the scene where Aguecheek and Sebastian engage to Aguecheek's detriment. It just seemed too bitsy...

887062,5,6304449313,"There have been many great Shakespeare drama adaptations, but Trevor Nunn's Twelfth Night is outstanding even among the greatest. It is wonderful how sensitively and excitingly he handles the issue of identity (girl disguising herself as a boy) and identification (male-female twins)problems.

The major character is Viola, who after losing her twin brother (played by Stephen Mackintosh very convincingly), is forced to disguise herself as a boy to survive in a strange and hostile land (namely Illyria which is at war with her home county, Messaline). The introductory scenes (not included in the drama)  showing how brother and sister, sharing a strong bond of affection, lose each other, how dangerous it is for a citizen of Messaline to set foot in Illiyra and how Viola is transformed into a boy give the story a very good frame. The scenes where Viola is being transformed are great, showing how sensitive this girl is, how difficult it is for her to pretend, yet she musters all her courage to hide her pain over the supposed death of her brother. But struggles are not over as she also has to hide her passionate love from Orsino, the Duke of Illyira whom she serves.

Her position is twofold difficult: she soon becomes Orsino's confident, they get really close to each other so she finds more and more difficult to hide her feelings from him; but to ease Orsino's sufferings, she undertakes to act as a ""courier"" for pursuing his hopeless love, the Countess Olivia.

Then comes another Shakespearean turn of the screw: Olivia, who won't hear of Orsino's passion, falls for Cesario/Viola. In the meantime, Sebastian, thinking her beloved sister, Viola is dead, sets for Illyria as well ...

As it is a comedy all things messed up will sort themselves out at the end, however, this is not a light comedy, the shadow of the tragic is hovering over the whole drama shaped in one of the subplots. The whole film seems to balance at the very narrow edge of tragedy and comedy all the time despite the many hilarious moments.

The most wonderful scenes are the ones of Cesario/Viola and the Duke Orsino (a very sexy Toby Stephens)being together. Nunn is actually showing the emotional and subtle sexual attraction the Duke feels for his ""manservant"". Absolutely brilliant!

Imogen Stubbs personificates Viola superbly: an upright woman, who, despite the disguise she is forced to wear, is the most honest of all, especially compared to the characters of Orsino and Oliva, both of whom are deluding themselves by imaginary feelings.

The whole cast is wonderful from Helena Bonham-Carter to Ben Kingsley. Music and costume all fit in amazingly with the whole atmosphere of the drama.",1131494400,17,2686,4.940133037694014

You can truly believe that Olivia, played by the always ""on"" Helena Bonham Carter, would fall in love with her. Toby Stephens is a revelation as Orsino.  He managed to make Orsino very noble and sexy while most actors tend to play him a little too whiney for my taste. It was a bit of a shock to see Ben Kingsley playing the Fool but I fell in love with him with in 10 minutes. All in all this film has taken the title of favorite in my home.  I watch it every time I can and always find something new to enjoy. The DVD is seriously lacking in any extras.  The ""behind the scenes"" feature is literally just that.  Someone set up a camara about 100 yard from the set and left it there.  No voice over or editing.  Very disappointing.  But one can expect such things from a movie that was not made in the DVD era.

887065,5,6304449313,"If this ""Twelfth Night"" is not the definitive ""Twelfth Night,"" it comes close. Under the guidance of director Trevor Nunn, the superb cast plays Shakespeare not only for laughs but also for the dark pathos that underlies the comedy, as is evident in Feste's song, ""Come away, come away death, and in sad cypress let me be laid."" Ben Kingsley portrays Shakespeare's enigmatic clown, whose rendition of the charming, but usually conventional, ""O mistress mine, where are you roaming?,"" is tinged with a tragic undertone. It not only complements the love-sick Duke Orsino's lament, ""If music be the food of love, play on,"" but, as its last strains linger in the air, it suffuses its listeners with an inexpressible sadness. It is as if, with the final notes, the hitherto roistering Maria, Sir Toby, and Sir Andrew, have become painfully aware of the ephemeral nature of life.

Imogen Stubbs is a delightful (and plausibly male) Viola, disguised as Cesario, who must act as a go-between for Orsino (an incredibly handsome Toby Stephens) and Olivia (Helena Bonham-Carter, who looks as if she has stepped out of a pre-Raphaelite painting). The scenes between Viola and Orsino, as she is falling in love with him and he is most definitely attracted to his young ""man"" and emissary, are fraught with a palpable sexual tension (A similar dynamic may well have been present in the original production when the audience knew that a boy was playing the part of a girl playing the part of a boy. Trevor Nunn conveys the ambiguity of gender with subtle artistry). Viola and her twin brother Sebastian look reasonably enough alike so that the audience can easily suspend its disbelief and, along with the characters, enjoy the confusion of ""Which one is Sebastian?.""

The production is reinforced by an ensemble cast. Nigel Hawthorne's pompous yet vulnerable Malvolio has the viewer laughing at one moment and crying at the next. The cruel pranks of Maria (Imelda Staunton), Sir Toby Belch (Mel Smith), Sir Andrew Aguecheek (Richard E. Grant) and Feste, the clown, bring Malvolio deservedly low, but as he leaves the household and his tormenters forever, the audience knows that the comic conspirators may have humiliated him, but they have not robbed him of his dignity. Malvolio's exit is followed by the departure of the brooding Feste, who, ""with a hey, ho, and the wind and the rain,"" strolls along the edge of a cliff above the shore. As he gazes out over the restless sea, he seems to be seeing beyond the play's comic narrative frame into the reality of a future that is ineffably dark.

Nunn's ""Twelfth Night"" is fast-moving and suspenseful, even if one has seen the play dozens of times. There are so many delightful moments that it is difficult to single one out, but the duel in the orchard between the terrified Viola and the equally frantic Sir Andrew is hysterically funny. The Cornish settings make for a stunning ""Illyria."" And since the audience is readily transported to that fantastic country, the pre-Raphaelite / Ruritanian costumes and settings do not spoil the illusion.",1128556800,30,3080,4.930635838150289

Good performances by Imogen Stubbs and Helena and good teamwork between them.  With a production this good and a play this monumental, it hurts all the more when there are flaws.

For one, the director was so keen to be true to the text that he had the actors even speak the typos.

For another, on one or two occasions, the actors speak so rapidly that they amalgamate words, as for instance in Viola's ""Be my aid ... my intent"" and Olivia's ""in indifferent red.""

More serious is the complete misunderstanding of the character of Antonio when caught by Orsino's men.  Instead of preserving his dignity and stroking his own ego as an Elizabethan man would, Antonio delivers this speech (""Orsino, noble sir, ..."") in a brattish, defiant, nose-thumbing way that makes him sound like a twentieth-century teenager caught smoking.

Still more serious is the apparently deliberate garbling or replacement of lines, as in the song, ""Youth is such stuff as will not endure.""  You will never guess that this is what the line says.  I claim it's deliberate because this line is sung over and over again three or four times.  One has the feeling that the filmmaker didn't want to antagonize youth (which is the majority audience) and make them think too much about the fact that their youth will be short-lived.

Still, this movie is far superior to anything Branagh has made and should appeal to general audiences, not just to the ""elite.""

But the depth that it had was great- when I read the play, it was kind of like 'Hmmm... okay, this is cool, love triangles!' And then it skipped to the servant scenes and I started racing through those to get to the, I supposed, 'better' action taking place with the twins.
But the servants have some of the best character representation out of the movie, especially Ben Kingsley as Feste and Malvolio- they rocked. And the main cast was perfect, as well.
All in all, probably the best re-doing of a Shakespeare play that I have ever seen... I loved it!
Oh- and how can anybody help but love the music to this movie? Kingsley's voice is magnificent, and makes you finish the thing wanting more. (My theater teacher is a performer at heart, and after our class finished it, he memorized the closing song- The Wind and the Rain- and that's practically all he sings nowadays... and what's worse, he has our English teacher doing it, too. :)

887094,5,6304449313,"The wonderful review by ""theviciouscircle"" says almost all:  this is a rare and beautiful filming of one of Shakespeare's most engaging comedies.  Every role is played to perfection -- the entire production shows the cast's and crew's intelligence, deftness, sense of play and extraordinary craft.  Every single actor has so embodied his or her part that I will never again see the play without seeing this cast in my mind's eye.  Ben Kingsley and Imogen Stubbs stand out even in this exceptional group.  The music fits every mood in the play; Shakespeare simply must have heard these tunes when he wrote the verses, and the themes and backgrounds further carry us into the spirit of the play.
The Cornish settings in autumn are almost too beautiful; at times, one almost misses the acting, so spellbinding is the countryside in which it takes place.  Trevor Nunn and his crew are much to be praised for finding locales that hold the story so gracefully -- we may know this is Cornwall, but we believe we are transported to Illyria.  All in all, it is difficult to imagine a more exquisite realization of a robust yet delicate play.  I have long waited to see this film on DVD, and in the widescreen format in which it was made -- how can the studio not release it?",1083024000,13,1265,4.641255605381166
887095,4,6304449313,"This film is basically great, because many of the scenes are merry and can make most people titter (which is not bad considering that Shakespeare's humour relies so much on word-play) and of course give you that ""warm"" feeling.
As for the well-known plot against Malvolio, the pranksters seem to waver between enjoyment and a bad concience for engaging in such an idle or childish activity. Unlike some other reviewers, I can accept the sometimes blank face of Sir Toby, the indifference of Feste and the sternness of Maria, although their behaviour creates an odd feeling, as if they are not really enjoying the revels. Maybe the director is trying to say that Malvolio is not the only ""malvolient"" character.
This is probably the play that has the best music of all, and Ben Kingsley's singing is good enough. It should not be more schooled than it is because Feste is obviously a street-wise singer.
The director deserves credit for slowing the pace down in the middle of the film. My favorite part is when ""O mistress mine"" is simultaneously played at the duke's court and sung by Feste elsewhere. Here, the plot finds unity and the many characters become powerfully united.
The best acting performance, if you ask me, is Imogen Stubbs as Viola. She comes across as a real person and somehow manages to show all her conflicting emotions at once. Many of the other characters come across as spirits, half human, which makes sense since they live in ""Illyria.""
The weaknesses lie in a gaudiness and, perhaps, in a fragmentation into too many clips and scenes. I've actually watched part of the film in black and white and liked it better that way. All music except that which is part of the plot should clearly have been done away with, including the overblown, flowery starting tune which completely drowns (sic) the misery of Viola after the shipwreck. There is no need to tell us at this early stage that it will be a warm and happy movie! A strength in some of Shakespeare's comedies is that they are in danger of ending tragically.
The ending has been criticised before and while I enjoy it and have shed tears over it I partly agree with the criticism. It also suffers a bit from the gaudiness.
Still, I'm very thankful for this movie and I could easily have given it a 5. But since it is Shakespeare my demands go up a notch. The film is good craftmanship and some of its problems are indeed hard to solve: the abundance of characters, the overflow of beauty - what can you really add in that department when there's already so much beauty in Shakespeare's lines?",1079568000,3,2572,4.654945054945055

And the fight between Viola and Sir Andrew Aguecheek was hilarious. However, the events surrounding Malvolio's imprisonment were supposed to be comical, as was his release from prison. However, they made it seem malicious, which I didn't take to very well. ALl in all, though, it was a great movie, and an excellent adaptation of a classic play, and I heartily recommend that you see it.
When that I was and a little tiny boy
With hey ho, the wind and the rain,
A foolish thing was but a toy,
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came to man's estate
With hey ho, the wind and the rain,
'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gates
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came, alas, to wive
With hey ho, the wind and the rain,
By swaggering could I never thrive
For the rain it raineth every day.
But when I came unto my beds
With hey ho, the wind and the rain,
With tosspots still had drunken heads
For the rain it raineth every day.
A while ago the world begun
With hey ho, the wind and the rain.
But that's all one, our play is done,
And we'll strive to please you every day.",1072396800,4,1748,4.570063694267516

As a student, Shakespeare has not always been my cup of tea,(save for Romeo and Juliet and A Midsummer Night's Dream) maybe because of the old English which I'm not used to at all in my part of the world. Anyway, this Twelfth Night movie actually made me realise that Shakespeare's works may not be such a bore after all.
Director Trevor Nunn has done an excellent job of adapting this play into a movie. Twelfth Night has everything I love in a movie: Great actors and actresses (especially Imogen Stubbs, Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Kingsley), a wonderful setting, lots of funny and witty moments as well as the melodious singing of Feste (Ben Kingsley). I believe that just by reading the play alone, you would never be able to feel the tenderness of the songs, nor the poignant moments between the characters. However, Twelfth Night the movie has successfully captured all the elements present in the play itself and I have to admit, it has blown me away!
All in all, this is an excellent movie and I bet that you, like me, will definitely feel the same way after watching Twelfth Night. Enjoy!",1068508800,2,1158,4.572115384615385

Nonetheless, it was an excellent film, transformed into a different era in a masterful way.  The acting was absolutely superb, including the crossdressing romance between Viola and the duc.  Toby Stephens shines as the duc, and it is unfortunate to see him spend so much time on stage.  We need him on the screen, sharing his talents with the world, not just the English people.",1062720000,2,505,4.964285714285714
887141,5,6304449313,"This is one of the most imaginative interpretations of Shakespeare (or perhaps anything) I've ever seen.  Although I have read the play numerous times, I never would have thought of doing it this way.  The story was fleshed out even more than Shakespeare did to begin with, and was made to seem modern and old-fashioned all at the same time.  Director Trevor Nunn did a wonderful job with this film (but of course he also formed the Royal Shakespeare Company, so what else would one expect?) :-)
Although each member of the cast does a great job, a few must be mentioned individually.  Imogen Stubbs proves to have an amazing amount of talent and versatility in the complicated role of Viola/Cesario.  Nigel Hawthorne is terrific as Malvolio, particularly in one hilarious moment where he tries to smile - something at which he is not too practised.  Helena Bonham Carter makes a very appealing Olivia.  Ben Kingsley is absolutely wonderful, and extremely expressive, as Feste the fool.
TWELFTH NIGHT is a film that is definitely worth watching over and over.",1049587200,15,1059,4.88268156424581

Orsino and Olivia make fools of themselves as they pine away in self-absorption, while Sir Toby and Aguecheek reek havoc, with help from Feste and Maria, in pathetic attempts to hold on to youth that's already passed them by. Feste is the soul of the show, and it's hard to imagine anyone doing Feste better than Ben Kingsley.

887143,5,6304449313,"This film is definitely among the finest adaptations of Shakespeare to film ever made.  The Bard's characters are revealed, enhanced, fleshed out by their surroundings and judicious editing.
One of the major themes, the nature of identity and gender identity in particular, is brought out vividly by the Victorian time period;  We see that it's no small matter for Viola to shed her feminine clothes and training to act like a man, or for Olivia to be the head of her household.  Imogen Stubbs is real and endearing as we see her as Viola/Cesario, concealing so much of her self to so many.
Trevor Nunn's directing is superb, especially when he intercuts between the original scenes to compare Orsino and Cesario here, Maria, Sir Toby and Aguecheek there.  Putting the two parts up against one another tells us a lot about what the Bard had to say about our own inner conflicts, and how much of those is healthy to share with the world.  Purists may argue that the orginal order is monkeyed with.  Myself, I've often thought that Shakespeare himself would have presented it much the same way if he'd had the benefit of film and editing.
The film's a visual treat too - both lush and stark landscapes, Olivia's estate a wonderland autumn setting.
My only bone to pick with the production is that it still is not released on Region 1 DVD.  My videotape is wearing out from use.

I must say, at first I really just got it because it gave a review in my Lit book when we were reading Julius Caesar, and it looked interesting. However, once I had read the book, I fell in love with the characters. I couldn't wait to read it again, which I did, a few times actually. I was 15 at the time, and once I heard there was a MOVIE of the book, I begged and pleaded until my father finally rented it from Blockbuster. While watching it, I thought I was in heaven...it was wonderful! It followed the book so well, barely changing a thing! It did take out a funny joke, about caper and mutton, but I could overlook that little thing. Anywho, once my birthday rolled along, I just had to get it...and my dear uncle actually bought it! I was so happy, it being by far the best gift I had gotten...aside from the car. I give this movie 5 stars, even if I haven't had as much experience in reviews, I know it deserves it.

Twelfth Night is my favorite Shakespearean play, and I've loved many different performances of it.  But this one lacks comic energy; the actors never really connect.  The only scene that sparkled was the swordfight between Viola and Sir Andrew Aguecheek.  Personally, I wouldn't watch a comedy if only one scene provoked laughter, not when Shakespeare usually makes me fall over in guffaws.

The melodrama with which Helena Bonham Carter plays Olivia never lightens into humor, and Imogen Stubbs is stiffly dry as Viola.  Worse, Viola and Orsino have little romantic chemistry.  The only truly convincing actor was the one who played Antonio, an unfortunately small part.  I was surprised that such a remarkable cast and director should produce this relatively dull work.

This movie was really good. I cannot think of a poor
performance. Helena Bonham Carter - what can I say?
I didn't know she was so good. Olivia is a difficult
part with the character having to leave behind her mourning
and in some sense come back into ""the real world"". She
succeeds admirably. Plus, boy can she speak the verse or what?

Imogen Stubbs - is now my idea of a perfect Viola. Oh my
goodness, yes. I just want her performance to never end.

Ben Kigsley - this is the first time I have seen the warmth
of the relationship between Feste and Olivia. It is very
touching - until Viola's arrival, you can understand he must
have been Olivia's only true friend. Plus though he is indeed
supremely manipulative in the plot against Malvolio, this
movie does not pit him center stage as some kind of sinister
Macheavellian controller of everything as many productions tend
to do. That always strikes me as a false way to play him.

Nigel Hawthorne as Malvolio. Does he put a foot wrong? I don't
think so.

Mel Smith and Richard E Grant as Sir Toby and Sir Andrew? I see
some negative reviews here about Mel Smith criticizing him as
playing Sir Toby as a drunk. Hello? Is there anybody in there?
If anyone was made to play Sir Toby it is Mel Smith. He makes
me laugh in the duel scene with just his facial expression when
he says ""They say he has been fencer to the Shah of Persia"".

is a little bleak at times, but that makes the comedy and

887170,4,6304449313,"Twelfth Night ""The Movie"" plays well for those who know the story and script. The gloomy Cornwall landscape lends itself beautifully to the comic yet melancholy themes. Personally, I would've scouted around for a lengthy, more cosmopolitan ""Main Street, Illyria"" than the production's short dirt road lined with rugged old structures. And I would've placed the characters on that active street often.

This production's beginning is different than Will's original, and seems horribly melodramatic and contrived. I always fast forward through that part.

The actors are perfectly suited to their roles. Sir Ben Kingsley nearly steals the show, though a strong runner-up would be Toby Stephens. He plays the Count Orsino with verve. This production is set in the Victorian era and it seems to me that his dark features, scowls and belligerent manner put him across as sort of villainous -- which lends a complexity to his character. Behind his excessive romantic scheming in adulthood, there lurks the impetuous reasoning of a little boy raised in privilege.

The dialogue is spoken too conversationally, lacking the punch that Kenneth Branagh often supplies to put across the meanings and intentions. Those unfamiliar with Shakepeare won't be able to tolerate it for long without the usual, ""What are they saying?!""

But for long time Shakespeare enthusiasts --- okay, okay, I'll spite my own critique: this is still a memorable movie experience and worth including in the collection.",997574400,2,1483,5.297872340425532

The acting all around is indeed superb and the sets are a visual feast. Ben Kingsley provides a lot of ""extras"" in fleshing out the role of Festy. I would place this film on a level with Branagh's ""Much Ado"" if it were not for the sound.

It got almost to the point that  I would laugh at anything, in hopes that the movie -- encouraged by my  support -- would come out of its shell.
Now, don't get me wrong -- the  movie is well-acted and well-staged.  It's just exceptionally slow to start  off. Unfortunately, the tediousness of the first hour or so was made worse  by the sound quality.  Shakespeare is difficult enough to grasp, but  abnormally quiet speaking voices make it downright unintelligible.
