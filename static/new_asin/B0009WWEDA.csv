8068805,4,B0009WWEDA,"As I've grown older, I have come to admire Elvis' early music the most, essentially everything that came before ""Heartbreak Hotel.""

This documentary attempts to go back to Elvis' early years and determine the various elements that came together to produce the phenomenon that hit the world in 1956. There are visits to his homes and schools in Tupelo and Memphis, interviews with his friends and classmates, an overview of the Memphis music scene in the early 50s, and some remarkably intelligent commentary by several music historians who actually know quite a bit about him. All the while, excerpts from his early hits play in the backgroud.

Unfortunately, there are no full performances of those early hits on this dvd, but they are available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-56-In-the-Beginning/dp/1568963696/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis '56 - In the Beginning</a>.

The general consensus is that the best of those that do is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-The-68-Comeback-Special-Deluxe-Edition-DVD/dp/B00025L42Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis - The '68 Comeback Special (Deluxe Edition DVD)</a>, although I found it to be scripted and forced.

For those who are interested in learning more about Elvis, Bobbie Ann Mason's brief biography&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-Presley-Penguin-Lives/dp/0670031747/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis Presley (Penguin Lives)</a>&nbsp;is excellent.",1187481600,7,1823,6.8111587982832615
