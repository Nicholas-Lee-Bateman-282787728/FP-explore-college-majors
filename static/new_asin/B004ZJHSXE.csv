4509264,5,B004ZJHSXE,"Again in Season two (2) on two (2) discs with four (4 ) hour long episodes (plus a bonus feature that is most informative giving the importance of Garrow to the British legal system and giving much insight into the ""real"" Garrow),  this very  splendid British historical drama ""Garrow's Law"", shows how William Garrow (wonderfully and intently acted by Andrew Buchan) is trying to get justice for all in 18th century England including slaves that were only considered property not humans, lower class people and/or those looked down upon by the so-called gentry.  What a marvelous series--it is so well directed and acted recreating the era being depicted fabulously.  We get the broad picture of England's judicial system of the era that favored the aristocrats along with Garrow's attempts to make the system fairer for everyone.  At the same time, the real character of Garrow along with his personal struggles (one being his love of Lady Sarah Hill the wife of the very nasty and powerful Assistant Secretary played brilliantly by Rubert Graves) is shown in a very believable way--one really admires Garrow and his efforts to change the judicial system for the better.

Season two (2) is very brilliant with wonderful scripts, great acting and marvelous recreation of the era--what gorgeous costumes. All four (4) episodes are really outstanding especially, to me, the second episode which deals with illegal love and Garrow continually being accused of adultery with Lady Sarah and suffering the ramifications thereof--really fabulous acting by all and tremendous writing on the subject of forbidden love.  It's a very touching  episode that I adored.  . I never knew that history could be so entertaining.  (By he way, the role of Lady Sarah is brilliantly played by Lyndsey Marshal--she is so good)  I can't wait until Season three (3).",1313971200,3,1843,5.089700996677741

4509266,5,B004ZJHSXE,"Quickly has become one of my favorite shows of all-time. Garrow's Law Series 2 confirmed as BEST HISTORICAL LEGAL DRAMA, tops Rumpole. Near perfection for late-18th century historical reproduction in sets, costumes, & dialogue. It's more realistic 1700s scenes than the true period. Stunning visual detail. The plots, cases, and people are from real British Old Bailey criminal court data- the beginning of justice. Sir William Garrow (1760-1840) initiated ""Innocent until proven guilty."" This TV series, accurately reveals him idealistic, rescuer for wrongly arrested. He's young, eager, belligerent, rash, arrogant, and a winner. Since Garrow was champion to the poor, this series gives viewers an accurate look at commoners' life. 18th century low class was often taken advantage of by aristocrats. Modern law has inherited much legal good begun by Garrow.

Stellar returning cast and powerful portrayals:
Andrew Buchan (Cranford) as barrister Wm Garrow could be played no better.
Lyndsey Marshall (Being Human) plays Lady Sarah Hill, exquisite in acting as well as filling her period aristocracy costumes. Those hats!
Alun Armstrong (Little Dorrit, New Tricks) plays the true-to-history character, John Southouse, Garrow's mentor, a solicitor (attorney).
Michael Culkin (The Hours, Lolita) is Judge Buller, mostly ruthless.
Rupert Graves (Forsyte Sage, Death at a Funeral-see the UK version) plays Sir Arthur Hill, Sarah's nasty spouse, now Asst. Sec. to the Admiralty.
Aidan McArdle (The Duchess, Ella Enchanted) is another REAL historical figure, John Silvester, a proud, rich, barrister who constantly opposes Garrow.

4 episodes each an hour, includes SUBTITLES, with multiple plots and one main plot carrying from 1 through 4. Bonus: behind the Scenes Photos, 6 text fimlographies, and a 22 minute SUBTITLED featurette on the real Garrow.

133 slaves are thrown overboard & drowned. The slave ship, Zong, Captain is tried for fraud--not murder. Dialogue quotes: ""Cargo can't be murdered."" ""Blacks be goods and property."" Meanwhile, Sir Hill attacks Lady Sarah believing Garrow is the true dad to his wife's son. Sleaze lawyer Farmer (Anton Lesser-Little Dorrit, Lorna Doone) is secured and will appear in all four 2010 episodes.

2-
Army Captain Robert Jones (Andrew Scott-John Adams, Longitude) faces death on a sexual assault charge. His friend (Rachel Pickup-Victoria & Albert) runs a Molly-house, male brothel, and this becomes a ""Buggery"" (Homosexual) case of two centuries past. Sarah & Garrow must not meet due to Sir Hill's legal action against both. But can they?

3-
A Greenwich disabled sailors' hospital mistreats patients, but it is the dire conditions reporter, honest Capt. Baillie (Ron Cook-Little Dorrit, Diary of Anne Frank) who needs Garrow to defend. Complicating matters, Hill is Baillie's libel accuser, he being Garrow's own accuser in the ongoing legal situation of adultery.

4-
Garrow tried for adultery. Surprisingly, Silvester, Garrow's longtime adversary, is in the courtroom. Lives, love, fortunes, and careers hang on a verdict. The ending is suspenseful and quite open leaving much room for more trials and romance in the 3rd series of Garrow's Law, which IS being produced. It's a CRIME to have to wait.

Of course there is a Garrow's Law: Series 1 that is equally compelling and worthy viewing.
Series 1 & 2 now prove this drama on a 6 star level with Foyle's War, Upstairs/Downstairs, Pallisers, etc.",1308096000,44,3446,5.407821229050279

As the one who coined the phrase ""innocent until proven guilty,"" he handles very fascinating cases that really reveal why his innovations were needed. In this season, Lady Sarah's jealous husband tries to land Garrow in debtor's prison for ""criminal conversation"", an old-fashioned term for adultery.  While he and Lady Sarah are attracted to one another, thus far their relationship has been above aboard.  There is a very fascinating opening segment involving a middle passage slave trading ship case and there is a most sad case involving a young twelve-year-old boy who is mute.  I have wondered watching this series how the prosecutor maintains his position, as he does lose most of his cases to the brilliant William Garrow.  However, a neat twist in this season is that the prosecutor does start trying to use some of Garrow's tactics against him.  This series is very historically done and very well done.

It was wonderful, enlightening about the time period, educational about the evolution of the legal defense system, and very entertaining.  And all the cases are based on real cases defended by the real William Garrow.  Excellent acting.  I'd seen Andrew Buchan in Broadchurch and Cranford, but this really showcased his talent. And he's easy on the eyes, too!!! I was only sorry to see it end!!!  Highly recommended to anyone who loves British period dramas.",1407369600,,631,4.6909090909090905

4509290,4,B004ZJHSXE,"Another current British production, GARROWS LAW is the story of William Garrow, the 18th-Century historical barrister who turned the legal profession on its ear. It was Garrow who coined the expression innocent until proven guilty and in this series Garrow is most certainly the champion of the underdog.

A certain amount of artistic licence is acceptable in fleshing out an historical character like Garrow. Presenting him as being particularly drawn to unpopular causes is to be expected, though isn't always successful.

This four episode series sees Garrow take on such issues as the slave trade, which works well as drama, as well as a reminder that Garrow has contemporary relevance as a defender of human rights.

Usually Garrows views and procedures as he undertook these courtroom battles are well-documented and the writers of the show are able to incorporate them into the scripts. This gives the program a certain authenticity which really serves the drama.

However one episode goes a bit too far, in my view. During this period in history in the United Kingdom, sodomy was a serious offence, punishable by a severe prison sentence. An accusation of sodomy was sometimes used as a tool to blackmail individuals who might, in all likelihood, be entirely innocent. The subject was considered so distasteful at that time that court records were censored, thereby leaving out details of the accusation and only recording the fact that such a trial occurred, and its outcome.

Historical records show that Garrow defended one such accused individual. From that scrap of information, the writers concoct an episode that essentially makes Garrow a champion of gay rights. While this is all acceptable to most contemporary mindsets, it is questionable in the context of an historical drama. Its modernistic and unrealistic to show the couple engaging in a tender kiss inside a prison cell. In a solidly historical drama, modernism is obvious and out of place.

Political correctness aside, this is the only aberration in an otherwise excellent set of episodes to further the series.

The other main story arc is Garrows relationship with Lady Sarah Hill, which results in his being charged with criminal conversation, which was the 18th-Century euphemism for adultery.

The strains of these circumstances test Garrows ability to focus on the other cases in his workload, including one involving a young child.

Andrew Buchan is appropriately principled as Garrow, but it is especially appealing to see the great Alun Armstrong again as Garrows friend and mentor, John Southouse. Armstrong is also currently one of the principal cast members of New Tricks. His character couldn't be more different in that show.

GARROWS LAW is an excellent series, only occasionally marred by striving to present an admittedly forward-thinking hero as just a little too much in synch with contemporary values. Still, there is much more to enjoy than there is to criticize.",1397433600,,2961,5.201680672268908
4509291,5,B004ZJHSXE,"Season two of Garrow's law takes some personal turns, both in the stories of Garrow and Lady Sarah and in the courtroom.

Initially, like the reviewer who gave the second season two stars, when confronted with the stories of the slaves and the homosexuals, I thought, oh here we are imposing post modernist thought on history. Not so, and just a bit of an internet search proves it. I found it so interesting I must share (forgive me for being such a nerd)  and begin by saying that all the cases presented in the series took place at the Old Bailey or other courts of law.

Concerning episode 1, featuring insurance fraud, during which 'cargo' in the form of human beings from Africa is jettisoned off ship in the Caribbean for the value of its loss against market value of slaves.
Antislavery sentiments began with the Enlightenment philosophers Rousseau and Montesquieu writing against the trans-Atlantic slave trade. In the 1780's the Abolitionist movement was in full swing and featured in the work of political economists such as Adam Smith and the active works of the Quakers. The American Revolution and the loss of the colonies caused the British to examine their own role in their Empire as the political debate focused on both freedom and enfranchisement. In 1787 The Society for Affecting the Abolition of Slaves was founded, and within it freed Africans played a most instrumental role.

As for Homosexuality, events depicted in the second episode are accurate, though the details of the trials themselves were censored and are unavailable for detailed historical examination. Apparently London had a flourishing homosexual community, centered around 'Molly Houses', though until 1861 homosexual acts were punishable by death. Most of the cases brought to trial however were in incidental cases such as blackmail, since the actual act required witnesses to intimate details. From the 1690's onward, in successive waves, Societies for the Preservation of Manners actively pursued  homosexual men employing spies, provocateurs and thief takers -and one such large action took place in the 1770's.

On the personal level, concerning  Garrow's own trial where he is accused of adultery with Lady Sarah, the laws of coverture under Common Law were as such (I'll cut and paste from Wikipedia for the sake of expediency): ' A feme sole had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name. A feme covert was not recognized as having legal rights and obligations distinct from those of her husband in most respects. Instead, through marriage a woman's existence was incorporated into that of her husband, so that she had very few recognized individual rights of her own.
 A married woman could not own property, sign legal documents or enter into a contract, obtain an education against her husband's wishes, or keep a salary for herself. If a wife was permitted to work, under the laws of coverture she was required to relinquish her wages to her husband. In certain cases, a wife did not have individual legal liability for her misdeeds, since it was legally assumed that she was acting under the orders of her husband, and generally a husband and a wife were not allowed to testify either for or against each other.' A woman after a divorce was generally left destitute. If I understood it correctly the trial was conducted as a property dispute, Sarah's husband seeking financial restitution for the loss of his wife.
 The third episode has to do with fiscal and political corruption at at the Greenwich Hospital for retired seamen. This case is centered around libel laws--often used to stifle opposition in the UK, after a pamphlet is published accusing the Earl of Sandwich for appointing officials, not for their abilities, but, in exchange for their votes.
Fascinating stuff.",1395100800,,3801,5.011093502377179
4509292,5,B004ZJHSXE,"This is an excellent series and in the same tier as Foyle's War,  Downton Abbey,  The Tudors...Can't understand why it is only 3 seasons. It was just getting powered up when it ended! I had finished viewing season 1 when I read a lot of the reviews;  after reading that one reviewer thought the series degraded into a tasteless explicit and gratuitous romance (ahem...the reviewer would likely faint upon viewing The Tudors!), I was expecting to be disappointed but on the contrary found the romantic scenes very mild, brief and not offensive in the least. The most intriguing intellectual aspect of this series is the awareness that it is based on actual cases from the London Old Bailey records and a real--and monumental--historical figure, William Garrows,  who had the moral fortitude, razor sharp analytical skills, and emotional intelligence to square off with the entrenched and Draconian British legal system and politically corrupt elements within the British aristocracy. The mood of the set of Old Bailey and the period costumes, combined with the often nuanced expressions and interactions of the players in the stifling, often smoky confines of the courtroom, make this a tense and riveting piece of work.

Not only that we get a glimpse back into the brutal world of the 1700's , and the english system was far superior to most of the worlds courts at the time!, we also get very accurate historical sets as well.  This one looks great and has a extra in words about the true Garrow. What a man he was by any standards! We all owe him and thankfully this show is out there to familiarize us with this law reformer who coined the term 'innocent until proven guilty"". His influence can be felt in the U.S. as well as other countries as his cases were legendary in those days.  This show is well worth your time , as it moves fast and is engaging om many levels. Rupert Graves plays a excellent villian too. His insane jealousy causes him to lose his own son and that is just a part of how bad he is. Alun armstrong plays a tough lawyer too , he's always done a great job which is why it's great he's in here. (he's great in New Tricks"" too.)

Of course there is a Garrow's Law: Series 1 that is equally compelling and worthy viewing.
Series 1 & 2 now prove this drama on a 6 star level with Foyle's War, Upstairs/Downstairs, Pallisers, etc.",1333152000,,3446,5.407821229050279

4509311,4,B004ZJHSXE,"My family and I were looking forward to Series 2.  We all enjoyed it except the scene in the jail where the men were kissing each other.  I don't discriminate against homosexuals, but I don't want to invite it into my home either.  I know that it is a way of life for many people, I just don't want to see it.  That is the only part that bother our family that we did not want to see.  Other than that, everything else was a fact of life, this is too, we just don't like see it on screen in our home.  Other parents may consider that when deciding to view this with their minor children.",1331596800,4,587,4.017241379310345

4509314,5,B004ZJHSXE,"Garrow was the fellow who made courtrooms a place where you just might get a fair trial instead of being hung.  Or worse.  When I started the first series, I was disturbed by the first courtroom scene as it seemed so chaotic.  But I kept with it and it turned out to be one great series. The chaos was how it was then, with the wealthy minor royals there for entertainment, and the poor and mostly innocent defendants being the entertainers. Although actually, at the time there was no true defense offered them.  They were murdered. Sent to death by purchased judges, and jurors who were probably purchased as well. The jurors took seconds to come to a decision and Garrow was so frustrated by the whole process he undertook to change it.
His private life is also examined in this series, but the romance certainly adds to this a 'true story' about a real honest to gosh barrister.",1324080000,,882,4.528301886792453

I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT THE INFLUENTIAL ONLY CAN GET FAIR TRIALS, BUT THE UNINFLUENTIAL. IT IS GREAT TO SEE A GREAT MAN GO AGAINST THE UNFAIR SYSTEM, EVEN AT THE RISK OF HIS CREDITABILITY, LIVELYHOOD OR LIVE TO HELP THE UNDERPRIVILEDGED.",1323734400,2,391,4.157894736842105
4509316,5,B004ZJHSXE,"Loved this series.  It brings to light the law as practiced in the late 1700s in England and is based on the real life experiences of a barrister named Garrow.  The cases before the court involve, for the most part, the poor.  ""Justice"" as handed out in those days was far from fair.  Garrow is young, headstrong, idealistic, intelligent, and a gifted speaker.  Quite often he wins his cases and quickly gains respect, even from his adversaries.  There is also a love interest (with a married woman) which reveals the mores of the time and place.",1318982400,,546,4.635416666666667

The script takes some liberty with the facts of his life but in general sticks to the important elements of the landmark cases he dealt with.  The settings are superb.  Well worth watching",1499558400,,338,4.677966101694915
