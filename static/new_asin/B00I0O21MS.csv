8638085,5,B00I0O21MS,"This set contains the entire 7 seasons of ""Sorry"", including recent interviews and at least one Christmas special.

Recorded in the 1980s, Ronnie Corbett's tour de force comedy ""Sorry"" remains bright and fresh in its humor. Corbett plays Timothy Lumsden, the 40-something librarian still living at home with mummy and daddy, held there by magnetic forces from which he can never seem to break free. His mother is played with shrill ruthlessness by Barbara Lott, who uses every means to keep him from leaving the nest. His hen-pecked father has long since given up, and the whole scenario could make for a depressing Freudian drama except for the ebullient wit of Ronnie Corbett, whose antics turn it into high comedy. Like a smart-aleck fly caught in a spiderweb of maternal fussiness, Timothy knows he's trapped, but can't admit that he's largely responsible for his own plight. In the meantime, he resorts to all manner of plots to evade his mother's controlling eye, as, in his words, ""Mother is the necessity for invention.""  A veteran of panto theater, Corbett's  body language and facial expressions are every bit as funny as his ""sarky"" patter. Attending a nightclub dressed in a cat costume (because Mummy put all his clothes in the wash) and trying to act suave about it is something you're not likely to see anyone else carry off with such panache. Ronnie Corbett, if you're reading this, thank you for so much fun and laughter!

This set is Region 2, so of course you must have a code-free player to watch it.",1398211200,2,1520,4.812260536398467
