5163535,3,B008H6GHM4,"I purchased this to help fill out my collection, mostly for the Benji movie which is probably the best movie in this set. ""Benji the Hunted"" is almost entirely animal scenes other than some setup in the beginning, so it's very relaxing in a way.

""Where the Red Fern Grows"" is a pretty faithful adaptation of the book, so if you enjoyed the book you will like the movie as well. The boy playing Billy does very well in the role, but it ends the same as the book so be prepared to cry if you're a tenderheart like me.

""Rascal"" is done in the classic Disney style, with a cute animal getting into trouble. It's paced pretty well and it has an interesting setting, Wisconsin at the turn of the century. Younger kids will find some of the scenes pretty hilarious but the laughs are a little thin for adults.

""The Journey of Natty Gann"" has a female main character, which is a nice change, and has a pretty good story. It has some stars that you may recognize, like a young John Cusack, and Ray Wise. Parents of younger kids might want to have a quick watch before showing it to younger kids under 12 or so, it has a lot of realistic situations from the Depression and the life of hobos riding the rails, plus some language.  The dogfight scene is especially intense.  I will say that the DVD transfer for this was  AWFUL.  I think they must have lost the archive copy and gotten the source for the DVD off a beat up VHS from the Goodwill. The first few minutes of the film during the opening logo and credits shake like a tape that needs to be tracked, but this effect becomes less noticeable later.",1435190400,8,1597,4.303333333333334

5163540,1,B008H6GHM4,"I thought that this must be nice collection, because Disney usally has some good ones.  The only one worth watching is the Rascal Movie and it isn't a Disney best for sure.  I had always wanted to see the adventures of Natty Gann and was so looking forward to it.. Whoa, stop right there.  This moving has bad language and a lot of of adult content, not the family movie I was expecting at all, just not good.  I have no desire to ever see again and would love a refund on my time.",1425340800,,481,4.085106382978723
