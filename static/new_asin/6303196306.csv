7841102,3,6303196306,"CRYING FREEMAN 2: SHADES OF DEATH, Pt. 1 (1989) is the first sequel to CRYING FREEMAN: PORTRAIT OF A KILLER (1988), which offered a near-perfect animated adaptation of the first volume of the celebrated manga (comic book) about a Japanese sculptor-turned-Chinese assassin for the 108 Dragons. This edition offers a far less perfect but almost scene-for-scene adaptation of the two stories contained in the first half of the ""Shades of Death"" cycle of the graphic novel series (written by Kazuo Koike and drawn by Ryoichi Ikegami). The first story, ""The Tiger Orchid,"" tells of Beya-san (Bakah Sin in the manga), the greatly oversized, immature granddaughter of the leaders of the 108, Father Dragon and Mother Tiger, and her bid to oust Crying Freeman as their successor by conspiring with someone high up in the organization. The second story, ""The Wind and the Crane,"" spotlights a lone black female assassin, Kitche, and her attempt to kill Freeman by identifying and exploiting a perceived weakness in him. She slips past his security by posing as a white, blonde female golfer and manages to reach the 108's floating submarine HQ where she tries to carry out her plan.
As in the first volume, the animation strives to capture the rich, dramatic qualities of the manga artwork while expanding the action scenes to meet audience expectations. There's a slight drop-off in quality, however, from the first to second volumes and the overall mood is just not as well established. Another chief problem is that the two stories, though unconnected, follow one right after the other. Such a pairing makes sense in print, but deprives the anime of a single narrative arc. Still, overall, it's a pretty spectacular example of crime-themed anime and manga adaptation and, it must be said, delivers the requisite amounts of violence and bloodshed, along with ample nudity, expected by fans of this series. There are some excellent fight scenes between Freeman and his varied attackers and some playful and tender moments between Freeman and his wife, Fu Ching Lan (the new name given to Emu from the first volume).",1029888000,,2107,5.040114613180516
7841103,5,6303196306,"This is one of the best animes ever made. I'm speaking for the entire series. The idea that a normal man can be brainwashed into becoming the perfect assassin is a brilliant idea and the fact that he cries every time he kills as a release is what makes this anime so great. Much of the time, Freeman is naked but you don't see any of his *important* parts due to shadows and this huge tattoo that covers his body. There are sex scenes in the first movie that are highly erotic so it's not something you want the kids to watch. But for adults this series gets an A+ rating.",1001980800,3,572,4.162162162162162
