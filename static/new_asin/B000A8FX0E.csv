8076320,5,B000A8FX0E,"Based on a play, this 1998 film directed by Rachel Perkins, is the story of three sisters coming together for their mother's funeral in a remote Northern Australian community. It is a bitter sweet tale of family dysfunction and the unearthing of a family secret. Deborah Mallman, playing the role of the younger sister Nona is the goad and foil for her two older sisters, coming in from the city all spit and spunk. The striking Rachel Maza is Cressy a 'successful' opera singer with demons controlled by will and discipline that begin to unravel as the story unfolds. Lastly Trisha Morton-Thomas plays Mae the sister who stayed home to care for their mother-chain-smoking and full of resentment but very much her own person. It is a very good film on sibling relations and unfolds on screen as a play with plenty of snappy dialogue and humour. Although the play was written as a focus on the relationships between sisters with the playwrights wanting it to be a universal theme the director of the movie has placed an equal focus on this being a story of indigenous women and this adds power to the story. Recommended but because of the material it is not light or easy watching.",1420243200,,1180,4.677884615384615

8076322,4,B000A8FX0E,"This movie is almost ten years old.  The storyline is simple enough and it is best suited for the stage and yet, it delivers.  The mother has died and all three daughters congregated for her funeral.  The eldest daughter is never happy and she's bitter.  It's obvious at the way she drives, the way she conducts herself.  the youngest one is the chirpiest of all, reminding the sisters of their mother.  The essence of her returning home is that she's pregnant and she hopes to stay with the eldest sister for a sense of security.  Then, there's the second daughter who has since become a professional opera singer overseas.  The eldest daughter resents the second daughter not because she's jealous of her achievement but that she doesn't wish for her younger sister to take pity on her.  As the movie progresses, we would understand why the second daughter refuses to come back until the mother passes away.  As the opportunity arisen for all sisters to share their opinions and their secrets, it's only timely and appropriate for them to eventually do the unthinkable, to burn the house down and so does the memory and start afresh again.  A poignant movie that ends in good note.  Highly recommended.  Brief commentary and only eighty minutes in length.",1148515200,,1257,4.790697674418604
8076323,5,B000A8FX0E,"The screenplay for this film was written by none other than the incredible Louis Nowra (based on his stageplay). That in itself should be enough to make this film a classic; add the extraordinary cast, the breathtaking cinematography, and you have a film that is like no other! Giving this film just five stars does it a great injustice...it is truly a treasure in every way imaginable!",1141430400,,386,4.776119402985074
