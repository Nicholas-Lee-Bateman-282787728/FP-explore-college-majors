4934405,5,B00632KUMW,"Only watched Menace and Friday so far, both great movies. I see what people are saying about the extended version of Friday but I personally like the added footage, especially John Witherspoon's little speech for cube at the refridgerator, if you have seen Friday before but not the extended I think it was worth it for that one scene alone! The Blu-ray transfer of the movies looks great.",1449273600,,389,4.735294117647059

4934448,5,B00632KUMW,"I'm a fan of all 3 of these movies and own each of them on VHS & DVD. But when I saw all 3 on Blu-Ray for such a low price I had to get them!! I already knew that Blu-Rays video & sound quality are head & shoulders above DVDs but what I didn't expect was the bonus material added to each movie!! I've been watching these movies for 20 years thousands of time & was taking back when I put Friday in & seen scenes I've never seen before, not even on the DVD deleted scenes!! A new opening to a new ending & plenty of more, it was like I was watching a new movie!! Not just Friday but all 3 movies were like this, filled with never before scenes!! I'm buying a copy for my cousins birthday & I'd definitely recommend them to fans of these movies. Not to mention you're getting 3 separate Blu-Rays for less than today's average movie ticket cost.",1380758400,5,842,4.047904191616767
4934449,3,B00632KUMW,"Not sure how Friday fits into this gangster flick combo, but whatever. Quality is decent, the remastering wasn't so good on Menace II Society but it's not the DVD sellers fault, it's the studios. I've downloaded higher quality movies than this. The directors cut of Friday was too extra and made the film unfamiliar, didn't like it. I should have just bought the original Friday on Blu-Ray instead.",1376438400,,398,4.867647058823529
4934450,2,B00632KUMW,I was greatly disappointed when I began watching these movies.  The picture quality was that of an old VHS and changed into dvd quality as the movies played.  Rarely did I see anything close to blu-ray quality picture.,1360627200,2,218,4.7105263157894735
8491663,2,B00632KUMW,"Friday is not the ""original"" movie- it has added scenes that suck!!! Should be the ""original"" bad to the bone movie... Menace II society is good. Not a fan of Set it off personally, but really this Friday version sucks!",1505433600,,219,4.5
