879103,4,630442065X,"When considering the characteristics of opera, it naturally follows that the genre would be difficult to film.  Not so for Mitterrand with his Madame Butterfly;  from casting to direction to filming, Mitterrand wins.  The title role must do far more than ""look Asian,"" she must also  live the role...even more so when being filmed as ""Butterfly.""  Ying Huang proves herself a sensitive and sensible actress as well as a  singer with an expressive and powerful voice.  Richard Troxell as ""B.  F. Pinkerton"" shines in his role, allowing the callousness of his  character clash with an accidental love.  Troxell uses the flexibility of  the film medium to act as many opera singers seem unable to do upon finding  themselves on a stage.  In fact, the power of this video lies in the fact  that the singers realize that they have the opportunity to be better actors  than they could be in a staged version of the same work.  There are  retakes, more natural positions, beautiful scenery, and an amazing  acoustic, even when outdoors!  All in all,it is a fine work by Frederic  Mitterand, Huang, Troxell, Cowan (""Sharpless""), Liang  (""Suzuki""), and the rest.  None of the roles had less than an  accomplished actor and singer; even the role of ""Kate Pinkerton""  played by Constance Hauman was rendered with a delicate hand aware of a  conflicting position and an involuntary hostility.  Enjoyable for the  everyday opera viewer as a fresh, beautiful feast for the eye and ear, and  a first-rate film for the opera newcomer.",930268800,144,1518,4.916666666666667

879379,5,630442065X,"Translating any opera to film is a tremendous challenge. Not many can do it well, and the challenge comes from trying to mix two completely different art forms successfully.

Opera was created for the stage and the magic of theater. Film can have much magic, but can also be more reality based. Making the proper choice when filming an opera is critical to it being convincing in the film medium.

I applaud this production for the reality that is in it, but I also was disappointed because that same reality took away the magic. And Puccini needs magic to really work.

But let's first discuss the high points of the film.

The singers are fantastic. There's no question about it!

Richard Troxell has great voice and range and he manages Italian tenor with strength, passion and conviction. Also, he is an incredibly handsome Pinkerton. So he is easy on the eyes, and powerful on the ears. He is definitely one of the strong leads of this film.

Ying Huang takes on the difficult role of Butterfly with wonderful grace and elegance. She is very convincing in the part as the naive Butterfly. It is nice to see an Asian playing an Asian, even if we've got a bit of a mix-up between Chinese and Japanese going on here. Huang is a brilliant soprano with a clear voice and strong delivery. Plus she is beautiful to look at, so she is a great match for Pinkerton.

Ning Liang makes a wonderful Suzuki. Her voice is very strong and she plays the role very well. I've always liked Suzuki, she's the only character in the opera with any common sense, but because she is a servant, no one pays attention!

Richard Cowan delivers a fine and powerful Sharpless. His appearance is a good match for Pinkerton, although he looks a little young for the role. I have always imagined Sharpless to be a man of middle age, more of a father figure to Pinkerton. But I love this man's voice!

Jing Ma Fan presents us with a great Goro, the marriage broker. He's great. In this film, Goro is not as comic as I have seen in some productions. Here, he is a bit shifty and crafty, hard to trust. Of course he is as handsome as Pinkerton and Sharpless -- and what a singer, he's very good!

As are the other members of the cast, with the exception of Miki-Lou Pinard as the child ""Sorrow"" (sometimes called ""Trouble"" in some translations of the text). It's not his fault, I think he was not given proper direction. But more on that later.

There are two other spectacular performers in this film.

The Orchestra De Paris/Choers de Radio France and

The cinematography and sets.

The orchestra is wonderful, extraordinarily rich and clear, the chorus suitably gentle when needed, and it does a great job as the angry family in the wedding scene. I love the orchestral performance throughout the opera. Brilliant.

The cinematography is very pleasing to the eye, a sumptuous visual feast, and the sets are very 'period', nicely done, and a great blending of traditional Japanese and 19th Century American styles. They provide a great atmosphere.

For all the reasons above, the movie is worth getting or renting, definitely worth watching.

However, the current (Feb 2013) price on Amazon is a whopping $105 for a DVD, which is just plain scalping -- probably because the film is rare right now. There is a much more reasonably priced VHS tape, for anyone who still has a VHS player.

I am sorry to say that the movie is not worth $105 - but I can't imagine any movie that is!

Regardless of the price, there are other ways to view the film, including YouTube (for the moment - until YouTube takes it down)

I had one problem with the film, in spite of all its strengths, and I'm sorry to say it is in the direction of the actors (singers).

I think Frdric Mitterrand took it a bit too literally, treating the actors as if they were on stage. On stage, opera singers do tend to stand around sometimes, and they do sing to the audience, not truly interacting with each other. That's because the audience is looking for them, and of course, it's the best way to project a voice into the house. At times, the actors do face each other, as in a love embrace, so the ""face the audience at all times"", is not a hard and fast rule.

When you have a film however, I feel that the actors need to actually interact with each other, which they can do because the singing is going to be separately recorded anyway. When there is dialog, interaction is way easier than when someone is singing an aria. Even facial expressions would help.

Something has to happen so we, the viewers, believe the characters are involved with each other. I imagine it is very difficult for a director to solve this problem. I don't totally fault Frdric Mitterrand or the actors for the fact that I felt they were missing an opportunity to be a bit more convincing as film actors here. I just found myself with a slightly empty feeling for them, a longing to be more emotionally attached to the characters as portrayed in the film. But I still love it as a film and I certainly appreciate that this was a tremendous undertaking.

And that leads to the poor kid in the movie. I have yet to see a child in Madame Butterfly who is convincing. It's a very tough role because the child has no lines, nothing to do, and is usually quite young. But he shouldn't be a prop. He really needs to have more interaction than he does in this movie. For the most part, I have to say, I had the feeling that the child was thinking ""Why is this woman singing in my face?"" I just did not get the sense that he had any attachment to her, or Suziki at all. I think stronger and more sensitive direction was needed to help out here.

In the end however, this is a really well done film, in spite of the minor problems. It's worth a watch for the music and operatic performances as well as the sets and cinematography.

But it is not worth $105 in my opinion.

Until Amazon drops the price, I suggest looking for it elsewhere.",1360368000,5,5945,4.455299539170507

879381,5,630442065X,"I am no opera expert by a long shot, but I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD production of Madame Butterfly.  The key ingredience for me was the fact that it was not a stretch of the imagination to see a Japanese, young (enough) and beautiful lead playing what is supposed to be a Japanese, young and beautiful, Madame Butterfly.  The arrogant American Pinkerton was played well enough for me to feel a true sense of American guilt over the way we so casually treat other cultures - especially in that period.  Left me wanting to read and learn more about that era.  Well worth the money and completely enjoyable.

879383,5,630442065X,"Excellent movie DVD.  The role of Cio Cio San can be performed either by a 300-pound dramatic soprano, or a lithe lyric singer.  For the latter, sopranos such as Ying Huang and Anna Moffo (DVD from a previous generation), both beautiful women, are visually and vocally credible. Any shortcomings in this DVD are minor:  (1) It was filmed in Tunisia.  Why not Japan?  Too expensive?  (2) Ying Huang is an attractive young lady, but the paint job on her face made her look much older.  (3) Puccini's B.F.Pinkerton is a despicable male slut, but Richard Troxell's Pinkerton is almost a likable guy. (4) I prefer a live stage performance, but there are advantages of a movie setting.

879446,3,630442065X,"Well done, wonderfully realized, and of course, the major musical moments were fully realized.  However, as I cultivate and educate my friend's operatic experience, I look for staged productions that give her a hint of how our local opera company might stage a production.  We get the season line-up, and order the operas to watch at home and learn the music and language.
  One of our favorite post-opera discussions is how our local company compares to the versions we have watched on tape, film and dvd.  Making a movie of an opera story just doesn't cut it for this, and this production is definitely a movie.  We prefer a stage production.  I also want subtitles in the language the opera was written in, as well as the English.  We enjoy listening with English subtitles until we have the story down pat, and then with the original language subtitles so we can follow the language as the opera is presented, and then with no subtitles ... then, we are ready to attend the show.
  Also have to say, much as I love Puccini, and as popular as this opera is, I really only find a couple tunes that resonate after the performance.  Seems a travesty to say so, but not my favorite opera.",1317081600,,1187,4.55188679245283

879448,5,630442065X,"let me respond to some of the idiotic comments some reviewers have made:

- puccini based the opera on a dramatised short story by an american writer. he didn't decide to set it in japan, and he didn't decide to make the villain an american. apart from that, the original story is based on some historic actualities;
- neither the film nor the opera is advocating what pinkerton does. it's a tragic and sad commentary on the attitudes that underly pinkerton's actions. so why attack the film as if it is an apology for those attitudes?
- you can't have a lead soprano that looks 15 AND has the voice of a 40 something plus soprano. the amazon review got it right - ""chinese soprano ying huang doesn't rock the rafters with her vocal power; hers is a tender, delicately observed performance"";
- the lead soprano doesn't have to look japanese. have you seen the ridiculous opera films starring white sopranos in blackface? get a life. audiences are sophisticated enough to be able to look past the ethnicity of the lead singers;
- someone even had the temerity to say she ""was no beauty"". do we really need such childish, sexist observations, not to mention entirely incorrect? she is a beautiful singer and actress;
- and yet another person said she was dull and old. for god's sake, old?! she was perfectly cast, and looked the part. you may not understand it, but it's impossible to find 15-year-old opera singers that can sing madame butterfly! ying huang was a good compromise
- ""visibly low budget"" - are you kidding?
- this most certainly wasn't a ""stage-bound"" or ""dramatically inert"" production. i loved how the camera chose to focus on other characters' reactions when someone was singing (e.g. the sly looks of goro, the matchmaker). if you know anything about film, this most definitely was cinematic in style, and the camera provides more than enough mobility. any more mobility and it would be distracting!
- this is essentially more or less puccini's opera. it is absurd to suggest that it has somehow been mangled or dramatically altered;
- the picture looked great on my big screen tv. if the movie looked dark on yours, you might want to consider getting a new tv, rather than blaming the dvd;
- what dubbing? needless to say that with an opera, you can hardly record the soundtrack at the same time as the action;
- i had no problem seeing or reading any of the subtitles;
- i noticed that the person commenting on japanese authenticity has a distinctly western name. even so, does it really matter whether or not the japanese women move with ""tiny minced footsteps""?

most of the positive reviewers have commented on the few missteps in the film (including the flying uncle, and the insertion of old newsreel footage), so no real need to harp on them again here. they do unfortunately mar an otherwise exceptional film

but above all else, this is a truly cinematic, deeply moving rendition of one of the greatest operas of all time (my favourite in fact). i've yet to see a better film version. i have seen this opera performed on stage many times - from sydney to prague - and to the opera snobs who say this doesn't hold a candle to a live performance, i say you're missing the point. this isn't intended to be a stage performance with world-class singers. if you can't see past your own superficial need for ""perfection"" then you won't understand what this film has achieved, and how wonderfully it has achieved it",1311379200,7,3436,4.666666666666667

879452,5,630442065X,"I'm a lover of opera and wondered just how good an opera would be transferred to the movies. Well, I wasn't disappointed in the least when I saw the DVD of ""Madame Butterfly"" done in 1996 by Martin Scorcese and Frederick Mitterrand. I was just enthralled by this movie, the singers, the orchestra, and of course by Puccini's opera of ""Madame Butterfly"". I almost was afraid since it was a movie, that it wouldn't have the whole opera, or all singing as an opera really is, but this movie surpassed all my fears and I just thoroughly enjoyed it except for that part when they had that black and white bit while the son is supposed to be dreaming. I didn't care for that part, but the rest of it, A++. I've seen ""Madame Butterfly"" on stage in a theater and she was always played by a caucasian woman trying to look Japanese and it didn't quite work for me, but this version on film was done by a beautiful oriental young woman named Ying Huang, who wasn't much older than the 15-year-old Butterfly or Cio-Cio-San, as she's properly named. Her voice just sent me, giving me chills of how beautiful her voice truly is. I don't normally watch a movie again right away when I watch them, but with this movie of ""Madame Butterfly"", I watched it 3 times in one afternoon, one right after the other, just to listen to the beautiful music of Giacomo Puccini and to the beautiful voice of Ying Huang. Richard Troxell playing the part of American Lt. B.F. Pinkerton was done so superbly that him being so handsome added just the right touch for the rogue he was. He just married her, Japanese style, for fun while he was stationed in Nagasaki, never intending to be with her forever while she had married him forever, never to part with him until their deaths. She didn't know he was doing that to her, so when he told her he would return in the spring when the birds made their nests, he didn't mean it and she was innocent of all of it, firmly believing him when he told her thus. When he does return, she's asleep in the bedroom with their son and doesn't hear Sharpless, Pinkerton and Kate come to the house. He doesn't let Suzuki awaken her because he doesn't want to face her because of all the guilt he feels. As he walks through the house, he remembers what took place with him and Butterfly those 3 months that he was with her and he can't stand it to the point he runs away, leaving Kate and Sharpless to tell Suzuki who in turn has to tell Butterfly that Pinkerton had married an American woman and they want Butterfly's son. When Butterfly finally gets up, she sees Sharpless and immediately knows Pinkerton's there or somewhere near. She looks all over for him, but finds him not. She begs Suzuki to tell her and all Suzuki can do is cry. When Butterfly sees that, she knows the worst and knows that Pinkerton's not coming to see her. Then she sees Kate and knows immediately that she's Pinkerton's American wife and now Butterfly realizes the full extent of the pain she feels. Kate asks for the boy and though it will break her heart, Butterfly consents to give him to Pinkerton and Kate. Butterfly had waited for him for 3 years and now he didn't want to see her, so Butterfly does the only thing that she can do and that's to commit hari kiri, because of the loss of face for her. Just after she has plunged the dagger into her heart, she hears Pinkerton calling for her, ""Butterfly? Butterfly? Butterfly?"" She stands with blood soaking the front of her white ceremonial gown, as Pinkerton runs into the house. He catches her in his arms to kiss her as she dies. This was originally written by John Luther Long in a book form in 1903. David Belasco had written the stage version of it for him and when Giacomo Puccini had seen it, the story just went to his heart that he wrote the music for the opera, with Luigi Illica and Giusepe Giacosa writing the libretto, and it was first performed in 1904 in Milan, Italy.",1277510400,5,3919,4.406896551724138

Even so, as a lyrical soprano, Ms. Huang is able to tackle most, if not all, the dramatic demands just by her voice.  If the suicide scene could be more powerful, her Cio Cio San would be just perfect.
Traxell as Pinkerton does not fare as well as Huang. Even though American, his vocal capabilities did not measure up to the demands of the role 'most' of the time. On the other hand, one is seriously led to feel that Jingma Fan, who portrayed Goro, would make a fantastic Pinkerton on stage vocally as well as dramatically - his is the timbre, the prowess, the look, the very feel of Lieut. Pinkerton, even if he is Chinese.
Ning Liang was vocally great, but not so much visually, with her towering height over the petite Ying Huang.
And both Liang and Huang, as one reviewer observed, were unable to convey the Japanese classic female movements in kimono.

The acting is top notch and the photography is crisp even on a 42"" screen.  The timing put you into the scene as if you are part of the play. The costumes are realistic and not stage egad rated or out of the time period.

The basic story is of an U.S. Lieutenant Pinkerton of the navy, stationed in Japan. He is used to a girl in every port. The 15-year-old girl in this port however gives up her home and religion to become his American wife.  She is due for an unbelievable shock when Pinkerton returns to Japan after a sojourn to America.

Everyone looks the part and sings very well.

879507,4,630442065X,"I don't believe in comparing stage performances of operas with filmed versions and this Butterfly is a very good example why. Film allows so much more latitude for obvious reasons yet the amazing thing is, directors don't often take advantage of it. In this version, director, Ponelle, does.
He has used a ""verismo"" style that brings much credibility and power to the story. Wonderful realistic sets and settings with a truly Asian cast including a beautiful Asian (Chinese) girl to play the tragic Japanese ""Cio Cio San"" (Butterfly) starts the whole piece on a level way beyond any staged performance, yet it also takes nothing away from them either.
Vocally, it is powerful enough yet it is obvious that without the benefit of ""filmed recorded sound track"" the heroine would hardly have the vocal power necessary to carry the role in a stage presentation- yet in this, it works well- almost brilliantly.  One could quibble about some small breaks in continuity here and there and some might find the ""flying rellies"" a bit of film latitude gone a step too far- but that is a minor point. Of far  more significance to purists, might be the archival film footage of Tokyo that is shown during the Humming Chorus.  It is interesting but a wrench away from what is traditionally a very moving few minutes in the opera.
That aside, this is definitely a Butterfly that belongs in any opera lover's collection- to sit right alongside one of the excellent staged presentations. In short, it stands clearly on its own and is easy to appreciate over and over again.",1247961600,3,1557,4.802238805970149

The levitating Japanese priest uncle was very strange for me:

OK, the 'floating relatives' were a little too Hollywood, but the close-ups, setting, costumes, acting and, yes, singing were truly sublime. I have several other performances on both CD and DVD, but in all fairness, none of them take you as deeply into the love affair between Butterfly & Pinkerton as this one does. Really, the only thing I've seen lately that approaches the intimacy of such a performance is the Met broadcasts live in theatres. If you only buy one Butterfly DVD, make it this one.

The sets are fantastic, the costumes are also amazing, and every little detail helps everything seem realistic. The Chinese actress playing Butterfly is heartbreakingly sincere, especially in her later, tragic arias. Richard Troxell as Pinkerton is as annoying as he is supposed to be, and as heartless. Suzuki is also phenominally developed in this film, and little details (such as when Butterfly and Suzuki are playing a game in the garden) help to foster the believability of their relationship. Everyone pulls their weight in this movie, and I have been unable to stop watching it since I got it. It is simply a beautiful film that suffers from some flaws that should have been taken out during editing - the grainy black-and-white film that happens in the middle of the movie doesn't work, and nor does her uncle flying in from the sky. But other moments, such as when Butterfly is singing about taking her son through the wind and rain, are staged so you see the vision she has in her head of what would happen, and it is heartbreaking.

Her support cast are just as impressive. Richard Troxell's tenor voice is magic and the love duet in Act One, ""Viene la sera"" (""Evening is falling"") just blows you away. Richard Cowan's Sharpless is quite powerful and a commanding performance and we are also blessed with an Asian Suzuki; Ning Llang. The Flower Duet in Act Two, Scene One, between Butterfly & Suzuki is breathtaking. The two voices blend so well, each seems to be an extension of the other. I cannot speak highly enough of this Butterfly. Normally I do not like filmed versions of operas, because you lose that intimacy between the cast, the audience and the viewer. But this seems to compensate for that, so I can recommend this Madama Butterfly un-reservedly.[By the way the Child is very cute]. My only gripe is the packaging. There are no notes what so ever, nothing, zilch! Which is a disgrace. You pay good money and you don't even get a chapters list.

Why the director chose to have Butterfly's uncle crash the wedding celebration via the air like a character out of Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon is a great puzzlement to me. It jars the realism shown up to this point. The insertion of old Japanese martial film during the singing of the beautiful humming chorus is a terrible disservice to the music and the plot, not to mention the film's  distraction to the viewer. Close your eyes at this point and concentrate on the lovely music. The omission of the orchestral interlude and bird songs from the waiting scene bothered me. One more small complaint. During the love duet at the end of the first act, the director has the singers sing facing front instead of to one another. This is practical in an opera house so the voices can be heard better, but in a film where the voices are recorded electronically, this is unnecessary.

879673,3,630442065X,"Filming an opera, especially one as globally well known as Puccini's, is a daunting challenge because so much of what has been composed and dramatized has been designed specifically for the stage of an opera hall. On one end, there have been superb video recordings of great stage performances, such as the 2005 Salzburg Festival production of Verdi's ""La Traviata"" with Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazn. On the other end are adaptations that try to cinematize operas with real locations, though most often with some deficiencies, for example, Barbara Willis Sweete's 2002 production of Gounod's ""Romo et Juliette"" with Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu frankly too old to play the young lovers. In the latter camp, this 1995 French-financed film shows director Frdric Mitterand making a valid attempt toward authenticity, but he misses a key opportunity to open up the visual and sensory possibilities beyond the obvious. Despite the creative use of Tunisian locations to replicate early 1900's Japan, the result still feels oddly stage-bound and dramatically inert despite some bravura musical moments.

The heavily masochistic story is familiar. In 1904, U.S. naval officer Lieutenant Pinkerton, while stationed in Nagasaki, marries a teenaged girl named Cio-Cio San. Despite their affections for one another, he cavalierly sees the marriage as one of convenience, and when his assignment is done, he goes back to the U.S. with no intention of returning. Cio-Cio San, however, takes the relationship so seriously that she sacrifices her family for the marriage. Three years pass by, but it does not deter Cio-Cio San from hoping for Pinkerton's return since it also turns out that she has borne their son in the meantime. Finally, a ship arrives and Cio-Cio San correctly surmises that he is on it. However, tragedy ensues since Pinkerton has remarried in the interim and wants to take his son back to America with him and his new American wife. Taken on the surface, the opera seems defiantly anti-American in showing Pinkerton to be a superficial cad despite how remorseful he may appear at the end, but it also takes a sideswipe at the purportedly subservient nature of Japanese women since her own self-delusions are so intractable. Regardless, the heartstrings are pulled at the right moments when the opera is acted in the manner Puccini intended.

Chinese soprano Ying Huang was chosen over hundreds of young singers for the title role, and while she does not really look Japanese, she displays a sweetly supple voice as she performs the dramatic arc of Cio-Cio San's plight. However, as a screen actress, Huang lacks a certain lightness in the early romantic scenes and seems a bit at sea with the later melodramatic moments. Even though she simply doesn't possess the plummy depths of a Callas or a Tebaldi, she provides affecting renditions of the two pivotal arias, ""Un bel d vedremo"" when Cio-Cio San looks out into the harbor awaiting Pinkerton's return, and her death scene, ""Con onor muore"". As Pinkerton, admittedly a tough role to play much less sympathize with, American tenor Richard Traxell matches Huang well vocally, but again his acting seems a bit shallow as he only shows unrelenting bravado in the first act and guilt-ridden regret in the third. The others in the cast fare better since there are less dramatic demands on them, in particular, American baritone Richard Cowan as the sympathetic consul Sharpless and acclaimed Chinese mezzo-soprano Liang Ning as the maid Suzuki.

Despite some nice art direction, the visual presentation feels somewhat flat when colors should really pop and the camera should provide more mobility to the action. There are also some scenes that simply do not work such as having Cio-Cio San's uncle and his acolytes come to banish her from the family in an airborne fashion and the use of anachronistic Japanese newsreel footage as a musical bridge. However, the sound itself is fine with superb orchestral support from the Orchestre de Paris under the baton of James Conlon. There is one extra with the 2002 DVD, a 12-minute making-of featurette which really amounts to following Huang from her initial audition through the actual production.",1160611200,22,4207,5.120815138282387

The cast is suited, in age and appearance, to their characters, which is hardly ever the case in stage productions. Ying Huang, who as Butterfly, carries most of the weight of the drama, gives a particularly heartbreaking performance. Yes, be warned, this is the weepiest of stories and you will need a good supply of tissues close to hand.

The cinematography is employed to great effect, enough to make this more than just a filmed stage production, yet not so much as would detract from the tightly focused drama. Any filmed opera has the problem of what to do with the intermezzo. Do you omit it? Do you leave the screen blank? Mitterand's solution is to retain the music and show actual film footage of early twentieth-century Japan as a visual filler. I think this works very well and helps to support the overall realistic feel of the movie.

There is just one false note: at the wedding, the gonze (Buddhist priest) appears as a supernatural figure, floating through the air. There is no good reason for this and it simply detracts from the dramatic impact of the moment. No matter, this remains an unmissable movie for all actual and potential opera lovers.

879793,5,630442065X,"French director Frederic Mitterand's gorgeous and melancholy movie makes the best version of Puccini's most famous opera. This movie is so well-made, so perfect, that after seeing it, you will be a true lover of opera. Filmed in Nagasaki, Japan, the beauty of the landscape in sprawling panoramic views in the springtime make for a beautiful setting. Authentic Japanese kimono and dress, as well as Japanese houses complete with sliding doors make it very realistic. Visually, cinematically, it's a masterpiece. Now as far as sound. While more than one critic may call it a poor quality Madame Butterfly, with the wrong cast, especially in soprano Ying Huang, there are many reasons that this is not true. In addition, as a movie, there are advantages over stage versions. We SEE subtle things, like Madame Butterfly's portrait of Jesus showing she has accepted Catholicism and renounced her faith. We see in the wedding scene how furious and powerful her uncle is who disowns her (flying in white robes like something out of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a very Asian motif). We see how the house Butterfly lives in is both beautiful, surrounded by spring flowers, but also an isolated little dream cage, a world entirely of her own making since she has been deceived in a false marriage with Pinkerton. The ending is so moving, if you don't cry, you miss the point of the movie.

This IS the Madame Butterfly as it should be sung and acted. Purists among the opera-loving world prefer to keep traditional, conventional staging and casting. Butterfly has been sung by the heavy, dramatic divas from Maria Callas, Mirella Freni, Reneta Tebaldi, Renata Scotto, among others. The role of B.F. Pinkerton is a prize-winning performance for the tenor who can sing it well, and many have sung it in their glorious careers- Luciano Pavoratti, Placido Domingo, and many others. However, this opera is not merely a tenor-and-soprano tragic romance. It's not Wagner's Tristan and Isolde which withou a doubt calls for a heavy tenor and soprano. In the case of Butterfly, she is FIFTEEN years old. Heavier voices make her sound older and melodramatic. She is supposed to come off as naive mostly. If she's dramatic, it should not be overdone. She's bold, she's spirited, she's only a full character when she's in love, and this is throughout the entire opera. It is her love for Pinkerton that has driven her to find a new religion (presumably Pinkerton's Catholic or Christian faith) and abandon her ancestral faith, to the cost of being disowned by her own family. In Ying Huang, we have the real Madame Butterfly. Her light voice can still deliver the dramatic lines and perfectly characterize a frail, love-sick Geisha of an inexperienced age.

Ying Huang as Butterfly, Richard Troxell as Pinkerton (doing a slightly lesser performance than the heroine. One would have wished they could have casted Domingo as Pinkerton but by this time in 1996 he was much older or unavailable for the role. I feel that Troxell's voice is not passionate enough. He is cast simply because he's a good looking man. But it works in the biggest part of his character - his image as a Yankee playboy who merely takes Butterfly's love for granted. The singers in the roles of Susuki and the Consul man are doing a fine job. This is a great movie that ought to be in every opera lovers' collection.",1102723200,18,3369,4.867595818815331

Madama Butterfly and the love and shy glances to his beloved,  are the same that the nahuatl women take to their husbands. Is a mistery, which makes more captivating, this absolutely wonderful movie. Huang is a so tender, yet powerful Butterfly that makes you smile, cry and reflect at the same time. She deserves an Academy award for this splendid performance.

who comes down by night on the bridge of the sky."" ~Butterfly

I love this romantic escape into a fantasy world of dreamy opera and sometimes the singing can literally make you heady. I fell completely in love with this story after listening to a 1987 London recording from the library.

The story begins near Nagasaki, although this movie was filmed in Tunisia. A Japanese house, terrace and garden is situated on a hill overlooking the harbor. There is a sense of serenity and peace, but this does not fully represent the future.

Lieutenant Pinkerton (Richard Troxell) is selecting a home and Goro brings him into the house to show him all the benefits of the house. He in turn thinks the house is ""as delicate as a puff of wind."" Which could rather be used to describe his commitment to his new bride, Butterfly (Ying Huang). We can't quite figure out why this naval officer wants to buy a bride when he is just going to leave her trapped in a beautiful cage for three years.

Is this not the entire fantasy of the knight who rescues a woman and then puts her in a tower? Yet, here the knight and the maiden don't seem to share the same commitment to one another and when the knight leaves, he seems to forget to even send a note back to the maiden.

The love duets are magnificent and beyond compare. The world literally dissolves when you watch this movie. The letter scene gives you hope and yet the sheer tragedy of the situation reaches new levels when Butterfly tosses Sharpless out of the house due to his heartless comments about her accepting a proposal from Yamadori.

I also love Butterfly's sweet innocence when she asks when the robin builds his nest in her husband's country, because in her country it has built a nest three times and she can't understand why her husband has not returned. He promised he would return when the robin was building his nest.

Butterfly has many opportunities to escape her cage with a variety of suitors, yet stays completely faithful. She lives with her maid, Suzuki. They almost run out of money while waiting for Pinkerton to return. When she realized Pinkerton has finally returned, she takes flower petals (peach-blossom, violet, jasmine) and strews them all over the house. She then falls asleep, exhausted from waiting up all night.

""Oh, the bitter fragrance
of these flowers
spreads in my heart like poison.
Unchanged is the room
where our love blossomed.
But the chill of death is here.
My picture...
Three years have passed
and she has counted the days and the hours!"" ~Pinkerton

""Madame Butterfly"" is an exquisite and faithful cinematic adaptation of  Giacomo Puccini's Opera ""Madama Butterfly"" set in Japan in 1904. It is really a heart-wrenching story of a young geisha who sacrifices her religion, family and life with a more suitable partner, like Prince Yamadori, while she waits for Lieutenant Pinkerton to return.

Unfortunately, a rash decision does not allow her heart to heal. This movie is just mesmerizing, heart breaking and terribly romantic. If you want to create a romantic atmosphere, watch on a rainy afternoon with a jasmine scented candle and jasmine tea.

In fact, it may be a long time before another one is attempted, simply because this is one tough act to follow. The setting, the costumes, and above all, the casting ... it is so obvious that everything in this production was planned and executed with tender loving care.
My teenage niece was captivated by this opera (after telling me she wouldn't like it!) She has since bought her own copy and it has opened up a whole new world for her.
This DVD never fails to give me goosebumps ... even when I just THINK about some of the scenes and arias!! It accomplishes the essential B and P of opera--Beauty and Passion--wonderfully.

879871,5,630442065X,"This is THE production of Madame Butterfly!

Pinkerton does a great job of making you hate him! Ying Huang is SO beautiful! Sometimes she even looks even YOUNGER than 15! And her bell-like voice, although it can lose its operatic quality, is still breathtakingly beautiful! She has the girlish beauty and voice for Butterfly (sure, it isn't a dramatic soprano voice, and it's not strong and rich enough for the stage, but it's still beautiful), and gives a heartbreakingly sad performance.

Ning Liang is EXCELLENT as Suzuki! She's also lovely and has an AMAZING mezzo-soprano! And she's a wonderful friend to Butterfly. Goro, so often portrayed as this bumbling idiot, is portrayed for what he is: a cruel, cynical villain. Even Kate Pinkerton has a touch of cruelty when she first appears.

The Bonze's portrayal of flying in is the only weak point. It looks SO cheesy! It is supposed to be one of the saddest moments and yet it just botches it up. Oh well. The end is especially heart- wrenching! She hears Pinkerton calling to her after she has stabbed herself and she tries to get back up(that part just really makes you tear up!)and then she dies in his arms.

879872,5,630442065X,"There are something very refreshing and appealing about this Madame Butterfly. First of all is the fresh-voiced cast, in which everybody is at the right age, in the right race, and with the right looks. Chinese soprano Ying Huang delivers a most delicate Butterfly. Her transcendent interpretation did benefit from, but not solely depend on, her oriental root. She has shown us that she has much more to offer: her elegant and pellucid soprano, her exquisite technique, as well as her subtleties in rendering the character. She conveys the demureness and femininities of Butterfly naturally, and with such ease that I believe part of the character is simply part of her. Well matched with Ying Huang's pure and light soprano, Richard Troxell's soaring and not-so-dark tenor portrays a very impressive Pinkerton. This Pinkerton would make you believe that if there were no Lieutenant Pinkerton, there would be no Madame Butterfly. Troxell's undeniable charms and handsome looks has very well justified Pinkerton's attractiveness which had captured Cio-Cio San's heart. Although at the end this is a character that ought to be condemned for his cowardliness of deserting Butterfly, you'd never question his infatuation with Butterfly, and you'd truly believe his pain and sorrow when he finally understood Butterfly's loyalty and realized that it's already too late. Both Troxell and Huang demonstrate superb acting, not at all inferior to their singing. In the wedding night duet their soulful performance and passion-pervaded singing bring out the uttermost beauty of romantic feeling. Other cast members are great too, especially Ning Liang, who sings Suzuki. She has an amazingly rich mezzo-soprano. You'd be impressed instantly as soon as she starts to sing, and then you'd hope she could sing more.
Being an excellently filmed opera, its beautiful sceneries and great camera work have remarkably caught each dramatic moment of the story. It indeed is an opera sung by the finest voices, while at the same time, it also is a movie of a touchingly romantic tragedy that reveals deep humanities rooted on western and oriental cultures.",1036540800,10,2136,5.266862170087976

879874,5,630442065X,"As a musical-theater enthusiast unfamiliar with the opera world, I stumbled across this production almost by accident when a visit to a ballet performance of Butterfly sent me scuttling thru the local libraries in search of Puccini's original opera. Used to thinking of opera as somewhat ""stuffy"", I was unprepared for what I found- I was completely caught off guard by the quality of the acting, and the power of the music. Within 5 minutes I had nearly forgotten I was watching classical opera in a foreign language with subtitles, and thought I was seeing yet another of my favorite musicals (believe me, from someone as enamored of Les Mis as myself, that is VERY high praise!) And the more I watch it, the more I notice of the care and detailing the actors and director put into this performance (try watching the consul Sharpless- carefully- right before he has to answer Butterfly's question about when robins build their nest).

I think it would be nearly impossible to find another version so accessible to non-opera people like myself. More seasoned opera lovers may, perhaps, criticize the singing; I personally cannot hear why. Huang may be light, but she holds her own against the best ""Butterflies"" out there; and no other Sharpless I've heard even comes close to Cowan's. Having since compared this with numerous other versions (including Scotto and Freni), I have found no other version yet that more closely captures, for me, the essence of these characters; the carefree, irresponsible charm and rogueishness of Pinkerton, the compassionate gallantry of the Consul Sharpless, the innocent naivete and heartbreaking vulnerability of Butterfly. ""B-List singers"", indeed!

There are a few decisions the director made, which other reviewers here have touched on, that I didn't quite understand: having the Bonze (Butterfly's uncle, a Buddhist priest) come in as a kind of flying ghost; using footage of old (pre-war) Nagasaki for the dream sequence during the Humming Chorus; and some of the changes made in the staging of the final sequence. Then, there was also just a bit more focus on the matchmaker, Goro, than I felt the role called for (he was even present in one scene near the end where he had no lines and did not seem to belong) But overall I would say this was a very excellent production. Since seeing it I have become rather obsessed; you might say I have Butterflies on the brain!

879878,5,630442065X,"I have seen several videos of Madame Butterfly and I am delighted to own this one. Filmed on location in Tunisia, this wonderful production gives reality to this tragic story. It is sensitively portrayed with good singers who are also great actors. Pinkerton was perfect for the role - amazingly believable, with great acting ability as well as a good voice. Butterfly was also perfect in the role - a delicate, fragile flower with an excellent voice to match. The two together made magic. Goro, the marriage broker, was appropriately sinister, and the Consulate appropriately confused about how to handle this situation.

The down-side, however, was the director's creative license, which detracted quite a bit from this wonderful production. Two scenes in particular come to mind which I feel Puccini would have rolled over in his grave if he had seen them. The first one was the three flying ghosts at the wedding, who admonish Butterfly for converting to Christianity. In my opinion this was a real stupid interpretation, since the original libretto called for a real-live angry uncle crashing the wedding. The second, which I feel was an even worse offense, was when Butterfly and Suzuki wait for Pinkerton throughout the night. That musical scene in the opera, referred to as the ""Humming Chorus,"" is haunting and is usually depicted with lighting effects as the evening slowly transcends into dawn. The director took liberties at this point to insert black-and-white vintage footage of 19th century Japan. Not only did this detract from the beauty of the scene and pull you completely out of the opera, but the clips were paced much faster than the music. He could have used his creativity instead to display a Japanese sunset, beautiful visual scenes of Japan, or just use effective lighting instead of changing the mood altogether. There were also several musical pauses during scene changes that broke the cadence of the music and brought you into reality with a thud. These were totally unnecessary and amateurishly done. The film should never take precedence over the music.

Generally speaking, even with these shortcomings, the entire production was a magnificent achievement and I would recommend it to anyone, especially to beginners who have never seen an opera. In my local opera group there wasn't a dry eye in the house.",1014163200,14,2340,5.0595854922279795
879879,3,630442065X,"This is a nicely done film of the opera, however, I still prefer the old, original version with Freni and Domingo (in their 30's) which still has the best singing and acting, in my opinion.  An Asian such as Ying Huang cast as Madama Butterfly is certainly more authentic, however, I didn't find her performance as touching nor her technique or timber as pleasing as Freni's.  Troxell seemed stiff and unconvincing.  The customers who have reviewed this film seem genuinely touched and that's really a good thing!!  I just could't find similiar feelings with this cast.  As a life long opera buff I always am trying to spread the joys of opera to others who haven't experienced the pleasures of the sport.  Opera is subject to much interpretaion on so many different levels which makes it such an interesting pursuit.  This film has some flaws when taken in the context of Puccini's concept which aren't really important if you enjoy the experience, the story, characters and performance.  I just felt it was conceived as an opera movie for mass consumption and that it could have been sung and acted much better with a higher caliber cast.  If an opera movie pleases a number of people on any level and inspires them to seek other works and performances, then it has succeeded in its mission.  The singers in this cast probably couldn't compete in live performance on an opera stage which is one reason I ranked it with 3 stars.  I like my opera sung on video with genuine internationally recognized singing actors who have had years of training and performing experience.  I do own this film, the Verona and La Scala which I have only watched a few times. I rank the Freni version #1 (watched it many, many times over the years) and this would probably be #2 of those commercially available.  If you like Madama Butterfly, see a live production someday!  It can be thrilling and move you to tears!  Certainly superior to video.  However, in the meantime, enjoy this filmed version, especially if you are new to opera and find a film easier to enjoy.  This opera is certainly an international favorite with a relevant  and timely story (""Miss Saigon"") and some of the most delicious melodies of Puccini.",997142400,14,2204,4.725130890052356
879962,2,630442065X,"While the singing is generally superb, the acting is not very good.  The costuming is not hardly recognizable as Japanese and the American costuming is much more British styling than the United States. Lieut. Pinkerton was more interested in playing to the camera than he was in becoming involved with Cho-Cho San (Madama Butterfly). Raina as Madama Butterfly did a good job in spite of a very poor job of makeup.  The hairdo was anything but what a self respecting Japanese girl would wear.  The widow's peak would be more appropriate for a Samurai warrior than a lady.  It still brought tears and memories when she sang ""One Fine Day"".  Most of the subtitles were unreadable since they were all in white and frequently against a white background.  I would give the orchestra and conductor good marks and many of the singers, but the women walked like europeans, not with the tiny minced steps of a Japanese lady of that period. Fortunately, I have heard enough operas sung in Italian that I was able to follow the main theme of the opera.  I should have bought the other Madame Butterfly which was advertised (for less money, yet), but it had no reviews and I foolishly trusted the reviews of the people who had seen this one.",988416000,6,1228,4.657407407407407
879963,5,630442065X,"Martin Scorsese's cinematography is utterly unparralleled in his filming of the beautiful Puccini opera ""Madame Butterfly"".  It is with a reserved caution that I say it surpasses any staged version of the opera I have ever seen!  I say that cautiously so as not to offend those die-hard traditionalists, myself having been one.  Scorsese transports us to an authentic Japan and his photography captures all of the intricate details and beauty for the setting of one of the worlds most beautiful stories.  The film is so real that one is truly moved to tears by the end and emotionally overwhelmed.  The mixed cast of both Asian and Western singers makes it even more beliebable.  Soprano Ying Huang sings and acts delicately the fragile geisha who will wed the American lieutenant Pinkerton, sung by American Richard Troxell.  Both are aptly cast in the film and compliment one another.  Ying Huang plays the child-like Butterfly accurately as the composer would have intended.  Troxell is handsome, charming and plays well the role of a not so nice character, leading Butterfly to believe he will one day return to Japan and take her back to America.  He's so charming, in fact, that at times one feels he may have a change of heart along the way.  From the beginning of the film with the torii standing in the Nagasaki harbor through the duration of the film, much in the leased 100 year paper and wood house built for Butterfly, one experiences many visual nuances.  Scorsese can even film the softness of a breeze blowing at sundown through the house, captured by flowers moving in the dimming sunlight in a vase.  The only fault I can find with the film, and it's considerable enough to detract from the overall experience, is the very unrealistic Bonze flying down from the sky at the end of the wedding ceremony.  It looked somewhat foolish, considering the rest was unprecedented.  Of the many filmed scenes, one that was effectively done was at the end of the opera, where Scorsese created a bad thunderstorm around the time Butterfly committed hara-kari and just at the time Kate and Sharpless pulled up in a carriage in the pouring rain to have Suzuki push the child out of the house and picked up by the Americans to be returned with his father to the States.  Lastly, the cowardly Pinkerton runs into the house hoping to once more see Butterfly, but rather finds her dead on the floor.  Scorsese captures the intense awkwardness and ambivalence of this moment that closes the film.  In my review, I've talked little about the music or the voices.  Puccini's music was sung convincingly by the cast and particularly Ying Huang and Richard Troxell, who both had great acting ability as well.  But the true essence of this production was the filming and Scorsese's ability to capture so many delicate moments through the use of cinema.  Please do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful opera, but rather on film as an alternate to the stage.  Highly highly recommended!",972777600,47,2982,4.805882352941176
879964,5,630442065X,"This film is an unusual portrayal of the opera. On the one hand, it consists entirely of a performance of Puccini's opera (in Italian). The visuals, however, are not the traditional stage sets, but rather a cinema-style, realistic acting out of the story by the singers.
I'm not one who normally finds Italian opera very accessible. But this film moved me to tears, and occupied my thoughts for days after I watched it. What made the difference is that the performers are not only wonderful singers, but are terrific actors and actresses as well.
This is not automatically true. Since opera is traditionally done on-stage, the performers usually use an exaggerated type of acting that projects from a small stage to a large audience.
For this movie, the performers were able to very succesfully adapt to cinema-style acting. In particular, Ms. Huang (as Madame Butterfly) projected every subtle feeling with devastating effect.

879965,5,630442065X,"The story happened around 1900.  Cio-Cio-San was about 15 years old and in a very conservative society.  So far in the world, there were so many opera  singers who sang for Madame Butterfly, such as Kiri te Kanawa, Regine  Crespin, Mirella Freni, Montserrat Caballe, Renata Scotto, Leontyne Price,  Licia Albanese, Yasuko Hayashi, Lawrence and etc.  However, no one had  expressed so deep feeling as Ying Huang.  One great example is the aria  ""Un bel di"".  90% of the other singers ignored Puccini expression  notes on the musical score or didn't do as good as Ying Huang.  At the  beginning of the aria, it should be a dynamic weak (pp) to show the voice  from distance or from imagination.  In the middle of the aria, two very  important slurs noted for  ""Chi sara? Chi sara?"" and ""Che  dira? Che dira?"".  No many people did so well as Ying Huang. The whole  middle section she sang so sweet (sweet as honey); so fluent (fluent as  milk); as a beautiful dreamer for a young girl.  Many of other opera  singers showed with sorrow and pain for that section of aria.  That is not  right.  Cio-Cio-San had a wonderful dream for Pinkerton to come back to her  and she also wanted to persuade Suzuki not to be sad, therefore herself  must not be sad.  The role of Cio-Cio-San as called by Pinkerton is  ""little wife"" and ""little perfume flower"".  Many other  opera singers are just too big in physical size to play the role of an  young oriental girl with the conservative voice with so much shy.  (Even  the Japanese soprano, Yasuko Hayashi, when she played the Cio-Cio-San role,  I found that her voice is unstable especially at the weak (pp) notes, no  memtion her ""big physical size"" and shyless acting.)  However,  when the voice need to be strong, Ying Huang is as strong as any of the  other sopranos: such as at the end of the ""Un bel di"", the  dynamic goes from ""f"" to ""ff"" then ""fff"" and  Ying Huang did show to herself and the maid the strength and power of the  faith that Pinkerton will be back.  The whole opera is a great work.  No  wonder it is one of the three Puccini's great opera (The other two are, La  Boheme and Tosca.)

Ying Huang has said  herself that her voice is too light to sing this taxing role live, but  onscreen her performance is definitive: she captures every aspect of this  bewitching character, and her performance deepens as Butterfly attains  maturity. She is well-matched by the handsome Richard Troxell as her  Pinkerton, who gives a more sympathetic portrayal of this odious character  than is customary. As her maid/friend/confidante Suzuki, Ning Liang is  perfect, and Jing Ma Fan is simply spectacular in the small but pivotal  role of Goro.  Once seen, this film is not easily forgotten. Have Kleenex  at hand, though....",945388800,33,892,5.3
