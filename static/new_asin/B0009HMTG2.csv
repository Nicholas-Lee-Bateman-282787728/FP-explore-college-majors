8061084,2,B0009HMTG2,"This video i at best ok. It is before the Tyson/Holyfield ear biting incident and the more crazy days so you are kinda left with ""what's next for Tyson?"" and at that point you already know. I would go with a newer documentary or Tyson's movie.",1420502400,,243,4.304347826086956

8061087,2,B0009HMTG2,"Hi,
I can't recommend this DVD unless you can buy it for under $5. There are ""stills"" where fight footage should be and too many non-important talking heads blabbing about Mike and not enough Mike talking. The new movie ""TYSON"" is out in the UK and will be out over here soon and is much much better. The two out of print ESPN DVDs are both HIGHLY superior to this tabloid styled bio DVD. I'm very disappointed in A&E , they usually deliver.",1245888000,2,441,4.325301204819277
8061088,5,B0009HMTG2,"You don't have to be a boxing fan or historian to enjoy this product. It is carefully assembled from rare footage and well-conducted and edited interviews with friends and co-workers. The subject is a great athlete of with high aspiration; his scientific physical and mental preparation, including an intellectual study of his occupation, bespeak a remarkably disciplined man in his worklife, but the antithesis in his private life. In that light, he should be taken very seriously as a cultural enigma. The reported menacing behavior is also well-documented and intolerable, though it seems that his complexity has been misunderstood by many.

This DVD concludes in the mid-'90s when he was living as a convict, when a future ""comeback"", or return at some level was just shakey speculation. His re-emergence, including more violence and confusion, of course is not covered. A very impressive production, nonetheless.",1173398400,7,917,5.368055555555555
8061089,2,B0009HMTG2,"Anyone considering buying this DVD should note that it was done in 1994. This DVD gives a cursory review of Mike Tyson and does NOT include his professional and personal battles after prison.  The interviews are good and keeps a steady pace, but more could have been said.",1172275200,6,272,4.666666666666667
