The first that I saw (included in this box set) was Letter from an Unknown Woman, a true masterpiece made in USA during the director's exile. Then came the unbelievable Lola Monts, in which Ophuls filled the CinemaScope screen with everything you can imagine, none but in a brilliant way. Le Plaisir, La Ronde and Madame De... were sumptuous pictures beautifully screened in the french belle poque. None of these films look old and out of fashion. Just refined, intelligent, good looking and hansome as ever. And the cast for all of them is superb!!",1260748800,10,589,4.728155339805825
