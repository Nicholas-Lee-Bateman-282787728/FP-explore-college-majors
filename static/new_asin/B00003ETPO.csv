8221228,2,B00003ETPO,"This is not the imax movie. It is just the ""making of"" of half
of it. Boring...
2/3 of the DVD is just the director talking about the imax camera.",1064534400,4,146,3.9
8221229,5,B00003ETPO,"This is not the IMAX original of ""Extreme"", but really a documentary of how they made it. In that respect, it deserves five stars. If you read about IMAX going to Everest (""Into Thin Air"", etc.), you get an idea of how much more difficult it is to get large-format films made (200 pound cameras that cost $300,000). BUT, with this film, you also get behind-the-scenes interview snippets with surfers, climbers, and filmers as well as more shots of the waves and such. If you keep that in mind, you will be better off.",1038182400,3,517,4.51063829787234
8221230,3,B00003ETPO,"I was disappointed to find that this is not the actual IMAX film transferred to DVD. Instead, it is a documentary ABOUT the IMAX film. It does indeed show some impressive footage from the original, but it was  frustratingly interrupted by interviews with the director and shots of the  camera crew.  The disc does NOT provide the ""sit-back-and-relax""  experience of awesome visuals and cool music that I was expecting, as the  constant voice-overs and back-and-forth switches between the beach and the  studio do become annoying.  It seems redundant for the disc to have a  ""making of"" section, as the whole disc is just that. On the  bright side, there is some great footage on sports that you don't easily  find on DVD (or anywhere else, for that matter). I'd recommend buying it,  but caveat emptor!",964483200,22,802,4.866666666666666
8221231,4,B00003ETPO,"EXTREME Summer DVD is second of two parts (Extreme Winter being the other) of this DVD edition of IMAX's EXTREME.  The summer edition is, I find, more daring in its pursuit for extreme sports than the winter one.  The whole  atmosphere for the film is man's interaction with nature, on sea, land and  snow (for the winter edition).  It showcases very good new age music while  featuring top athletes doing what probably only 10% of the world's  population dare to do. On the surfing side, instead the usual paddling, the  surfers are towed by jet skis miles from the shore to surf the perfect  waves, 30 feet high!  You can actually see the immense force of the waves  (though a lot of its IMAX impact is lost on the your tv-no matter how big  your tv may be).  On windsurfing, the athletes are also riding through  massive waves. Not much on the windsurfing in itself is presented, but by  how much air these guys are going.  These windsurfers were floating so high  above the waves that they have been said to have run the risk of hitting  the chopper w/ the camera hovering above.  On the side of rock-climbing,  forget Tom Cruise and his stunt in MI-2.  The two female climbers featured  are the best in the business.  The film shows how much of a vertical and  how high these climbers go and you can pretty much see the stress their  bodies go through to attempt such heights.",961977600,5,1381,4.471774193548387
