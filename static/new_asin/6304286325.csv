825813,5,6304286325,"I was first introduced to this film when my wife's oldest sister said it was a ""wonderful"" love story, and that we should all see it.  I thought, ""Not another one of these boring love stories.""  About a  half an hour into the movie I realized that this was not your average love  story.  My attention was glued to the T.V. and  I couldn't wait to see what  would happen next.  It restored my faith in love and committment again and  made me appreciate my wife even more.  This film has become one of our  family's favorite. We seem to enjoy it even more every time we watch it.  Definitely, a five star movie.",915753600,,609,4.245614035087719

This is my all-time favorite movie, so the movie itself deserves 5 stars.

BUT, the DVD I received deserves 0 stars. Not only is the supposed ""widescreen"" actually letterbox (black lines on the top and bottom, as well as left and right), but the copy I received is sped up. The whole movie is sped up faster by one-tenth, making all the actors sound like chipmunks. I tested the disc out on 3 different computers and 2 DVD players and the result is the same.

I just didn't want to believe that it was sped up and I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning the DVD. So I decided to test it against my original The Cutting Edge DVD (NOT gold medal edition) and it was true. The movie is too fast. Also, every time the actors move, there is interlaced video. You can take a look at the photo and video I uploaded. Since it's an ice skating movie with A LOT of movement, there's interlacing all over this movie. You can see that in the photo I posted. And in the video, the Gold Medal edition DVD is on the left and my 10+ year old original Cutting Edge DVD on the right. Notice how they both start in sync, but slowly the video on the left speeds up and goes ahead of the video on the right. That is because it's faster than the original movie on the right.

In conclusion, I am returning this DVD for an exchange in hopes that it's just a glitch and my copy is a lemon. I will update when I receive the replacement.

UPDATE: Received 2nd copy of this DVD. Same problem. The movie is sped up. It's so frustrating. How could they create a DVD copy of this movie with non-anamorphic ""widescreen"", interlaced video, and most frustratingly the sped up video... and then release millions of copies of this so-called Gold Edition?!?! The only good thing about this DVD is the behind-the-scenes Reflections From The Ice. So I'll keep the DVD for that, but I'll be watching the movie from my original 10 year old DVD copy of The Cutting Edge.",1465171200,4,2338,5.093994778067885

827066,5,6304286325,"Great movie. A must-see for everyone, young and old. Predictable ending but with perfect open ending for the future. It increases expectation from beginning to end, specially from the moment main characters met. Movie shows two parallel worlds, but with different characters, different psychology and worlds, totally different ways of seeing life. One character, a jockey player, (D.B. Sweeney as Doug Dorsey) not very devoted to reading, playing rough, not paying much attention to details, a macho man, but with a very strong character,  the other (Moira Kelly as  Kate Moseley) subtle, intelligent,  a skate figure dancer, highly literate, well-read young girl, wealthy, who has always had everything in life except for someone who might contradict her  and when Doug Dorsey just appeared in his life out of nowhere, with his strong character, feels like a challenge as Kate does not want to accept him for the simple fact that he is know nowhere and Doug challenges her as he realizes he is dealing with a very stubborn personality. Both characters start to feel or better say, see each other as someone they need to have close every day, not for the simple fact of practicing figure skating, but for the fact that they are both so opposed personalities, like the positive and the negative of a magnetic field that instead of repelling each other they just get closer and closer each time. Climax comes at the end. He breaks the ice by telling her that he just found out the he has fallen in love with her, she, who has been feeling the same for him, but being so proud-hearted, starts crying as she realizes her love is being requited.
Skating and figure skating are very far from my field of knowledge, but of all the movies I've watched dealing with this beautiful, still difficult sport, this is the only one that has touched so close how hard is to become a figure skating, specially, pair figure skating. It takes a lot of talent, patience, practice, sacrifice, dedication, etc.",1456790400,3,1988,4.838235294117647

827341,4,6304286325,"Released in 1992, ""The Cutting Edge"" revolves around a sassy female figure skater who can't keep a partner, Kate (Moira Kelly), and a hockey player, Doug (D.B. Sweeney), who's injury forces him to consider being the girl's partner. They seek Olympic gold with the help of their coach (Roy Dotrice) and the backing of Kate's rich father (Terry O'Quinn). Rachelle Ottley is on hand as Kate's rival for Doug's attention.

The plot is reminiscent of 1978's ""Ice Castles"" in regards to the romance between a figure skater and hockey player, but this is more of a formula sports flick. Moira Kelly is brassy in the manner of Carrie on The King of Queens (Leah Remini) whereas Sweeney comes across as a more likable Ben Affleck. People complain that they're so opposite that they couldn't possibly be a couple in real life, but there's a reason ""opposites attract"" is a saying. My wife and I, for instance, are total opposites, but have been happily married for over twenty years. Anyway, everything clicks for an amusing albeit predictable sports movie/drama/romance.

The film runs 101 minutes and was shot mostly in the greater Toronto area, but also Lake Placid, NY (the hallway where the couple first collide, the ORDA Complex) and Pasadena, CA (the interior of the chteau in France).

I'm giving this purchase only 4 stars however and for the reason that the DVD itself arrived with a large scratch over the graphic side of the disc, right over Moira Kelly's face and this definitely effected the ""play"" aspect of the disc, for example, there were some instances of the audio going out, white flashes and also some blackouts during the course of the movie. But because of the inexpensive price of this DVD, I won't trouble myself with returning the DVD. I am going to just go ahead and purchase another copy and hopefully it will be in better shape than this one is. Some times I think Amazon offers ""Factory Seconds"" amidst it's various offerings, hence the low price. I can't figure out why else the disc was so badly scratched when it was sealed tightly and still had the ""tape seal"" in place along the top edge of the case?",1449187200,,977,4.52542372881356

827575,1,6304286325,"Since this movie was not available via streaming services, nor mail-in disc rental service, I figured that I would just pick up a copy on Amazon, so to watch the movie which my wife fondly recalled.  Searching Amazon for ""Cutting Edge"" led me to this DVD version, the Gold Medal Edition, which was seemingly the only version available.  When the DVD arrived, we were only able to make it through about 15 minutes of the film, due to the extremely jerky video quality.  As a test, I played the disc on my computer's DVD drive (in case my player was trying to do some fancy smoothing/upconversion of the SD DVD), and the video quality was again very poor.  The movie itself is also sadly presented in non-anamorphic widescreen, a.k.a. a 4:3 presentation with letterboxing.  I headed over to a BD review site, to see if I could find out when the BD went out of print, and lo and behold, the review page for The Cutting Edge contained a link back to a BD version on Amazon, for only a few dollars more than this disappointing DVD version.  I'm not sure why the BD version is not found when casually searching the Amazon site for The Cutting Edge, and just in case you were looking for the HD version, here it is.  http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B004IZVMXM",1437523200,7,1247,4.565022421524664

Starring D.B. Sweeney and Mora Kelly

I have watched this movie a number of times and still enjoyed the ending. The story up to it is conflict between the two partnered figure skaters who are put together because of their situations.

Mora plays a spoiled prime Doa of the figure skating world and Sweeneys character is an unwanted hockey player. Their personalities conflict at the beginning into a rivalry to show which is best.

When the respect of each others abilities leads to love, they have a major conflict. They each realize their need for one another which leads to a climatic end result.

On the ice, they find each other with a joining result after each finds the best in each other.",1435449600,,724,4.625

This is the story of a hockey player named Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeney) who can no longer play hockey and is forced to work in a factory. After hours he continues to train even though no professional franchise is willing to put him on their roster. Determine to play he enlists into the local bar league that is happy to have him. Then one day a coach happens onto him while he is working on an outside job. He introduces himself as Anton Pamchenko (Roy Dotrice). Doug mistakenly believes him to be a hockey coach. Anton explains that he is not a hockey coach and then hands him a pair of figure skates. And then the plot thickens. Doug is transported to a wealthy businessmans residence who among others things has his own ice ring. Kate Moseley (Moira Kelly) is along in the ring skating. After introductions Anton proclaims that they could become a figure skating couple and make it to the next winter Olympics and possible win a gold medal. After a few rocky starts they are soon on their way of making that a reality.

Character Development

It is not often that the lead roles grow as individuals and change so dramatically. Doug is the basic fish out of water character, but Kate also needs to grow up and adapt and overcome her differences. There are role reversals and clever moments and regressions. Character and broken down and built up again and it really doesnt give much away to state that they is a happy finish.

Acting

What is truly wonderful about this film is that the all the lead roles and many of the minor ones do a stellar job in the acting department. Sweeny and Kelly have a ton of chemistry together and really move along the romantic wedge of the story forward. The writing plays well with their playful banter which is quite often. They try to outdo each other on and off the ice and become a better team because of it and grow closer together despite themselves.

Overview

This story is one of the better ones and even though they have tried to duplicate the magic in this film more than once they couldn't get the lightning to strike twice. But this fact doesnt go against the grain of movie history because other remakes have gone just as poorly, the film Sabrina (1995) with Harrison Ford would be one of those examples.",1406419200,,2260,4.4975609756097565

I tend to turn my nose up at stories where people move heaven and earth to be together after knowing each other only a few days.

828401,5,6304286325,"Back in 1992,it was the Olympic year and The Cutting Edge was released. It romantic comedy film. The plot is about a very rich, spoiled figure skater Kate Mosley,played by Moira Kelly,who is paired with a has-been ice hockey player,Doug Dorsey,played by D. B. Sweeney for Olympic figure skating. They face off against a Soviet pair in the climax of the film, which is set at the site of the 16th Winter Olympic Games, in Albertville, France.

Kate Mosley is a world-class figure skater training for the 1988 Winter Olympics. She has genuine talent, but years of being spoiled by her wealthy father have made her all but impossible to work with. Doug Dorsey is an exceptional hockey player with drive, skill, and a full complement of arrogance. His team is also in the Olympics. Doug suffers an eye injury during that game which damages his peripheral vision, and he is forced to retire from the sport.

In the lead-up to the next Winter Olympics four years later, Kate has driven out all potential skating partners with her attitude and perfectionism; her coach, Anton Pamchenko, needs to find another replacement. He proceeds to track down Doug, who by now is back home in Minnesota, working in a steel mill and playing in a semi- professional hockey league on the side. Desperate for another chance at Olympic glory, Doug agrees to work as Kate's partner, even though he has a macho contempt for figure skating. However, Kate's snooty, prima donna behavior gets on his nerves immediately. The first few practices between them do not go well. In time, though, their relationship grows warmer, and they learn to work together and become a pair to be reckoned with both on and off the ice. They advance all the way to the finals in Albertville and look to be one of the top pairs competing for the gold. Everything is going well until they realize that they have fallen in love with each other. Doug and Kate are forced to reconcile these new feelings with their mutual desire to win at all costs.

Although a lot of the thematic formulas were applied in this film from other movies like sports underdog,unlikely romance from two people from different backgrounds,the United States-Soviet Union rivalry and many more,Cutting Edge works as it was entertaining from beginning to end. Credit that to the brilliant screenplay from Tony Gilroy. Despite of applying many clichs that have been used in many romantic comedies,the story was presented in a way that the viewer will find it both original,refreshing and surprisingly addictive. Added to that,there great chemistry between Kelly and Sweeney that the viewer will definitely be engaged in their characters. Aside from that,their performance made it heartwarming due to their honest portrayal. Both made the film engaging and surprisingly addictive. And of course,the one could never forget the 90's soundtrack in the movie led by Joe Cocker's Feel Like Forever. Overall,I consider this one of the best romantic comedy/sports movie ever released.",1399939200,,2996,4.964143426294821

828738,4,6304286325,"Love this film !  (Not very many Blu-ray reviews to be found yet, so here's some insight)
 .....Great film, however, the current Blu-ray release has very poor picture quality.  Let me explain. The first 15 minutes of the film is especially poor with heavy grain and what looks like smoke or a fog covering the picture.  After the first 15 or 20 minutes, things do get a bit better.  If you do buy it, realize that the first part of the film will have what I believe is the poorest picture quality of any Blu-ray I have probably seen to date.  Later in the film things get a bit better especially in the well lit interior scenes and the outdoor scenes.  Enjoy this fun film.  I have for over 20 years on laser disc.
 .....There is an excellent special feature on the disc:  The Cutting Edge: Reflections from the Ice.  It was produced in 2006 and provides some interesting insight into the actors and the film's production.  In my opinion, the film gets a rating of 5 but the Blu-ray quality gets a 1.

The acting is fine.

The cast - apart from the usual Hollywood nonsense, like casting a 30-something for the part of a promising hockey player (24, I believe, is when they stop thinking of you as a potential superstar in the real hockey world), or the idea that to give a good impression of a proper Russian accent one has to make extensive use of American idioms pronounced telegraphically (""I'm at bottom of barrel"") - the cast is okay. The lead man is charming and the lead woman so endearing you want to stroke her hair very gently and rush to the nearest jewelry store to get the ring.

The ending is brilliant in that you desperately want the movie to go on.

So I don't know why everybody's so upset. Maybe, because they're so sophisticated, and read nothing but Joyce and Dostoyevsky all day long, and are very fond of verismo opera, and happen to be former hockey and figure skating Olympians, they found this movie did not quite meet their expectations.

829030,4,6304286325,"Moira Kelly (Dangerous Beauty, ""The West Wing"") and D. B. Sweeney (Roommates, Memphis Belle) star as polar opposites who unite on the ice for a shot at Olympic gold in this inspirational romantic comedy from acclaimed director Paul M. Glaser (The Running Man).

To this day, when it comes to films about figure skating and capturing the essence of training and competition, the 1992 film ""The Cutting Edge"" is considered by fans of the sport to be one of the better films to showcase the sport.

Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (the actor known for his classic role in ""Starsky and Hutch"" and director of episodes of ""Miami Vice"" and Las Vegas and the Arnold Schwarzenegger film ""The Running Man"") and written by Tony Gilroy (The ""Bourne"" trilogy, ""Michael Clayton"", ""Duplicity""), ""The Cutting Edge"" was a cutting edge film at the time.

Featuring innovative ways to film figure skating, the film would star D.B. Sweeney (""Spawn"", ""Memphis Belle"", ""Fire in the Sky""), Moira Kelly (""Chaplin"", ""One Tree Hill"", ""The West Wing""), Roy Dotrice (""Amadeus"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"") and Terry O'Quinn (""Lost"", ""The X Files"", ""The Step Father"", ""Primal Fear"").

VIDEO:

""The Cutting Edge"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1).  Like many films from the late '80s to early '90s, picture quality for many catalog films on Blu-ray are unfortunately not in the best shape.  ""The Cutting Edge"" shows signs of age and definitely has a strong mixture of grain and noise.

Granted, picture quality for the film is more likely better compared to its DVD and VHS counterpart, certain scenes with red and blues actually do pop onscreen due to the sharpness but for the most part, picture quality is good.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Cutting Edge"" is presented in English 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Dolby Surround and French Dolby Surround.  The film is a front-channel driven lossless soundtrack.  Dialogue and early '90s music is heard crystal clear.

Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The Cutting Edge comes with the following special features:

  The Cutting Edge: Reflections from the Ice - (10:53)  D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly talk about their experience working and training for ""The Cutting Edge"".
  Theatrical Trailer - (2:04) The original theatrical trailer for ""The Cutting Edge"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Have you ever been on the ice and fall down while skating and someone to yell ""toe pick"".  The now used slang on the ice skating rink is derived from the figure skating film ""The Cutting Edge"".

There are not many films based on figure skating and for the films I have reviewed over time, sure there will always be ""Ice Castles"" and ""Love Story"" and I felt that back in the '90s, ""The Cutting Edge"" was a pretty awesome film when it came to how they were able to film ice skating and build contraptions in order to capture the skaters and make it look convincing.

But to my surprise, what was more interesting was to know that both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly trained in figure skating to the point where they were able to pull of certain moves on their own and make it look convincing on camera.

In fact, for Moira Kelly, she took it seriously and her dedication to learning to figure skate and amaze even the trainers because of her dedication to the training and even learning difficult moves quite quickly  (note: Kelly pushed herself so hard that she even fractured her ankle).  Granted, there are scenes of stand-in doubles for the more difficult moves but there are many scenes where you know that the two talents were actually on the ice and were skating.

Also, I felt that both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly did a good job with their role and both had great chemistry.  I enjoyed the ""opposites attract"" storyline but of course, for many people who are dedicated to the sport, the fact that a hockey player became a professional figure skater may seem a bit farfetched but I actually enjoyed the back-and-forth exchanges by both characters and felt that Sweeney and Kelly did a great job with their performance.

But what about the story?  Granted, the film is quite predictable and the plot is quite formulaic in structure and yes, there are people who know more about the qualifications of athletes in the Olympics and know that the film doesn't capture the true nature of the sport perfectly.  And I'm sure figure skaters would probably be the first people to be fairly critical of the film but one thing that this film has done is inspire many young people to take up figure skating and even Moira Kelly has mentioned how people continue to recognize her from ""The Cutting Edge"" and thank her for inspiring them to join figure skating.

As for the Blu-ray release, unfortunately those who are expecting the film to look pristine on Blu-ray may be disappointed to see that the film looks quite aged and for some, the high amount of grain and noise may not be to their liking.  But that's how a lot of films in the late '80s and '90s look and I would rather have the grain that excessive Digital Noise Reduction (DNR) and make the film look overly soft.  But I will say that the film does look much better than its VHS and DVD counterpart.  And as for special features, it was great to have the one special feature featuring both D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly many years later to discuss the popularity and their involvement in the film.

Overall, the way I felt back in 1992 about the film has not really decrease much in 2011.  Aside from the 2010 release of ""Ice Castles"" which tried to show modern technology capturing the competitive and technical side of ice skating, ""The Cutting Edge"" is an entertaining film that captures two characters who are from different sports, are different type of people and dislike each other but eventually, their dedication to teamwork leads to an appreciation of each other's skill and eventually making them an awesome team.

Sure, it's not perfect, nor is it a great film and nor does it capture the authentic nature of the road to the Olympics but even now, in 2011, I still feel that this is one of the better ice skating films out there.

""The Cutting Edge"" is charming, uplifting and entertaining.  It's definitely a romantic comedy that shines through the performance by Moira Kelly who is fantastic in this film.  And I also have to say that the chemistry and tension between her and D.B. Sweeney is quite convincing and fun to watch.  Also, if you ever hear someone yell ""Toe Pick"" when you munch on the ice, now you know what film those words came from.

Overall, ""The Cutting Edge"" is recommended for those looking for a ""good"" ice skating film but also an entertaining, romantic comedy.",1312156800,24,6731,4.758828596037898

I just want to give some thoughts...

The Cutting Edge (1992) is my favorite romantic comedy of all time.  It's funny, entertaining, serious, and emotional all wrapped into one great movie.  The acting is outstanding.  The best acting comes from, well, everybody.  My personal favorite is Moira Kelly's portrayal of an ice skater with a spoiled brat attitude, Kate Moseley.  D.B Sweeney also does a great job as  conceited ex-hockey star-turned-figure skater, Doug Dorsey.  Supporting actors Terry O'Quinn as Kate's father Jack Moseley and Roy Dotrice as figure skating coach Anton Pamchenko also perform great.

My favorite part of the movie is the argument that takes place about the ""button"".  I find it humorous and serious at the same time.  I also like the ""double or nothing"" and ""finger painting"" scenes.

I saw this movie in the theater probably seven times back in 1992.  I had never seen the same movie in a theater more than twice before.  In the years since this movie came out, I still haven't seen the same movie in a theater more than twice.

If you want to watch a different kind of romantic comedy that is many things rolled into one, then give The Cutting Edge a try.  I highly recommend this great film.",1294272000,,1296,4.714285714285714

Even the minor and supporting parts show inspired casting e.g. Roy Dotrice as Pamshenko, the Russian skating coach.

The skating sequences are beautifully edited and the tension is pitched at just the right level. The humour has humanity and is never profane. The story-line is a tried and true formula, but I still cry every time I watch it.

829165,5,6304286325,"**SPOILER ALERT**

I recently caught The Cutting Edge on television late one evening while working at home.  I was going to switch channels but when I saw and heard hockey and Olympic references I kept the channel there and am very glad I did; I was rewarded with a funny and heartwarming story that I might otherwise have ignored had I heard about the ""romance"" aspect.  This movie was an absolute joy to watch thanks to the superb acting by all involved.  Great acting has been lacking in so many movies I've seen lately, so go figure I can only find great acting in old movies...this one is 18yrs old now.  Moira Kelly should have received an Oscar for her perfect portrayal of a snotty, selfish, spoiled rich girl with, as we find out later on, has a soft heart.  Of course, that Moira is a stunningly natural beauty doesn't hurt, either.  Her acting skills were top notch here and she is notably skillful at portraying emotion perfectly for the scene and dialog with perfect timing.

Along with DB Sweeney, the two actors had perfect chemistry and timing especially at the key points in the movie.  The supporting actors and even the secondary background acting made The Cutting Edge so very watchable; it was well-written and the direction and final editing made this one worth watching again.  So, I bought the DVD and it is just as entertaining viewing it again even though I know what happens; that's rare for many movies.

The ending is not a giveaway, but you can clearly see through the actors that they are falling in love but don't yet know it and then you begin to see how perfect they would be for each other...the balance so needed in a relationship.  The ""Kate Moseley"" character so needs to be loved and DB Sweeney's ""Doug"" reveals the character is not as shallow as one may initially believe.  I really enjoyed watching this movie and, because of the outstanding acting, will probably watch it once per year or so like I do with other well-done movies that have become perennial favorites.  Highly recommended...and this review is coming from one who is not into romance movies at all.  Almost forgot: the DVD quality is a very good quality transfer.",1269993600,4,2170,4.643979057591623
829166,5,6304286325,"- Doug's confession to his blue-collar buddies in a crowded bar: ""I've been doing a little... figure skating.""
- Doug's incredulous brother: ""You've been doing what?""
- A confused voice from the back of the crowd: ""Finger painting...?""

A manly man's guilty pleasure: I happen to think that THE CUTTING EDGE is a really good, fun movie, even with the sissy venue and the pretty, pretty outfits. It helps a guy viewer's sensibilities, though, that D.B. Sweeney plays a gritty, down-and-out hockey player who reluctantly shifts to figure skating.

She thinks he's a neanderthal. He thinks she's, um, temperamental - but maybe the voice-over in the movie trailer said it best: ""She has a nickname that rhymes with 'rich.'"" 45 seconds away from the Olympic gold medal, and then it all falls apart for gifted figure skater Kate Moseley and her just-not-cutting-it partner. Elsewhere, when Doug Dorsey suffers a horrible injury on the ice, it spells the end of his hockey career. Where else can Doug turn to but... pairs figure skating? He's willing to give it a try. His prickly new partner, Kate, is more skeptical, to put it nicely. She rages at her Russian coach, ""What is this? Final stages of Ukrainian alcohol psychosis?"" Not surprisingly, Kate Moseley goes thru skating partners like tissues (8 partners in 2 years). But we all know it's gonna work out... eventually. That is, after heaps of Kate's smirky ""Toe pick!"" remarks.

Not that the story breaks any new ground or anything, but even though it unfolds in conventional ways, it's graced with terrific dialogue, snappy heated banter, nicely developed character arcs, and, most notably, marvelous performances by D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly. And it's no surprise, really, that their roles here are what folks remember most about them. In the bonus feature, Sweeney recounts past experiences in which he'd tripped on something and some stranger had inevitably called out, ""Toe pick!""

Sweeney and Kelly bring a palpable heat, some really nice chemistry. D.B. Sweeney is likable from the start, coming off as a regular cat. Moira Kelly has the trickier part because her character is such a, uh, demanding diva. But we eventually do get to see her vulnerable side, and your heart goes to her. Still, she's really great at delivering that offended, nose-turned-up look. Anyway, the contentious rivalry, the training montages, the class war (he comes from a working class community, she's from a filthy rich family), the falling in love unwillingly, the big skating finale at the end as they go for the gold and break out the unholily brutal Pamchenko Twist... these are all easily predicted signposts. But how can you not get pulled in? THE CUTTING EDGE is irresistible stuff, and very romantic.

This DVD is the ""Gold Medal Edition"" and includes three bonus features: a sneak peek at THE CUTTING EDGE: GOING FOR THE GOLD (which, by the way, features neither D.B. nor Moira and isn't nearly as good); the original theatrical trailer; and ""THE CUTTING EDGE: Reflections from the Ice"" - an 11-minute-long retrospective as Sweeney and Kelly reminisce about their experiences in making the film.

829169,4,6304286325,"I already owned the plain version of this, released in 2001.  The only extra on that version is the original theatrical trailer.

I just bought the ""Gold Medal Edition"", released 2006, because it was cheap and it had some extras that I didn't have on the other disc.  (I haven't watched those extras yet, so I won't be reviewing them here.)

However, I noticed something very interesting.  I played them side-by-side, using two computers with identical monitors that are calibrated identically.  I noticed several differences in quality.  Then I switched the DVDs to the opposite computers and played some of it again to verify that it had nothing to do with the monitors or computer settings.

The Gold Medal Edition runs 1hr:37min:17sec -- 97min, as advertised on the back of the case.  The plain 2001 version runs 1:41:24, also as advertised on the back of its cover (it rounds up to 1:42).  This doesn't seem to be from a difference in content, though.  When playing them side-by-side, starting them off in perfect sync, they quickly become unsynchronized (ironic, considering the content... synchronized skating...).  The Gold Medal Edition runs faster than the 2001 version.  (The physical DVD itself isn't running faster; it's the way the film was transferred during production of the DVDs.)  IMDB claims 1:41 running time (101min), which would suggest the 2001 version is correct; however, I don't know where IMDB got that data -- whether it matches the actual theatrical release or not.

Also, the Gold Medal Edition is _not_ anamorphic.  So if you have a 16:9 TV (like an HDTV), unless your DVD player or TV automatically compensates, you'll actually get letterboxing both on the top/bottom AND on the left/right.  The 2001 version is anamorphic, so there's a good chance it will look better than the Gold Medal Edition on 16:9 TVs.

Finally, the color balance is different, and the 2001 version looks more correct.  One major thing I noticed is that when they're on the ice and/or wearing white, the whites look cleaner, brighter, and more white on the 2001 version.  Whites on the Gold Medal Edition look yellow by comparison, and even a tiny bit green.

The picture looks cleaner, brighter, better color-balanced, and just better in general on the 2001 release.

If you can't find another version, the Gold Medal Edition is still ok, and you might want to buy that if you want the extras.  But I'd recommend the 2001 version if you can find it, especially if you're picky about quality.  The 2001 version has a fairly plain cover, with plum/purple text for the title.  The cover doesn't mention anything about any kind of special edition.  And the back cover will say ""1 hour 42 minutes"".  (The Gold Medal Edition says ""Gold Medal Edition"" at the top, has white title text, and says ""Approx. 97 Minutes"" on the back.)",1249689600,13,2830,4.878406708595388

829172,4,6304286325,"I keep telling my girlfriend this is a guy movie, and this is how I see it...

A rugged hockey player named Douglas Dorsey (DB Sweeney) is on the verge of greatness.  He's in the Olympics and his career is on cloud nine.  He's nearing a lucrative NHL contract that will set him up with millions.  A massive, if not illegal, check from a foreign hockey goon sends his career, his health, and his life into a tailspin.  In walks the Russian coach (or is he a spy?) Pamchenko to change his world.

He links Douglas up with vixen Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly), a virtuoso on skates whose heart is just as cold as the ice on which she effortlessly glides.  Her weapon of choice: the deadly toe pick.  TOE PICK!  Her beauty, brains, and ruthlessness rival that of any Bond villain.  Under the tutelage of the Russian, the two team up to take over the world and fill their pockets with gold...via the unjust scoring and judging system of the Olympics.

Without a single on-screen sex scene or bloody hockey fight painting the ice red, Dorsey's vigor and testosterone must carry the majority of the movie.  He's left to fend off another threatening injury - a head shot - while overcoming his partner's tendency to fold under pressure.  To overcome the Russian's evil, communist plot he'll have to battle enemies at every stop, bed a gorgeous redhead spy from a heated rival while placating his neurotic partner, and pull off a miraculously daring last feat of flying athleticism that leaves his enemies and Jackie Chan in awe.  Is it too much to accomplish?  Does he have too much to overcome?  It's a rip-roaring good time - complete with a superb early 90s action montage - that is sure to keep everyone interested all the way to the enjoyably predictable end.

The editing is excellent to keep us unaware (most of the time) that these are not ice skaters, but actors pretending to be ice skaters.

In the standard formula movie where the boy and girl start off hating each other and end up loving each other, this is much better than most, because of the strong performances by Kelly and Sweeney, and by a very strong supporting cast.

829452,3,6304286325,"I've read and gotten a kick out of both the negative and positive reviews of this film on this site.  I would have to say that my opinion runs somewhere down the middle.

The film starts off on a good note with clear character definitions.  Dorsey is the womanizing jock who doesn't know the meaning of the word responsibility, but pulls through when he is needed.  Kate is a frustrated diva who hides her insecurities by blaming everyone for her failures.

Things get a bit hazy, though, as the film progresses.  Certain plot points are never really explained.  For example, how did Kate, who can't even keep a skating partner, attract the love of a Harvard business graduate?  Kate isn't a people person.  Why did Hale, her boyfriend for the first part of the film, want to be with her?

Everyone seems to just know that Kate is a Wonderful Skater.  And that's supposed to be enough to support this fallen diva?  I think that once most athletes mess up at an Olympic event, their careers are finished for good.

Why does Dorsey think that he has to prove himself to Kate and her father?  He seems pretty self-confident to me, even though he's mad at the world.

Later in the film, Dorsey watches a video of Kate's botched Olympic performance in 1988.  Viewers see only a second of the clip, and it isn't clear what Kate did that was wrong.

I agree about the drinking scene not being necessary.  I was thirteen when I first saw this film and remember giggling during the scene, but now I find it a bit shocking.  I experimented with alcohol in later years and learned the hard way it's not as light on one's body as is depicted in films and TV.  Dorsey hits the nail on the head:  Kate makes a lousy drunk!

I thought the love story was cute, altough far-fetched.  D. B. Sweeney carried himself well as the dreamboat leading man.  I was looking at recent photos of the actor, and sadly, Father Time has not been his friend.

Moira Kelly is attractive in a tomboyish way.  There's a scene where she checks herself out in a mirror, and I thought, ""Don't push it, honey.  You're not THAT pretty!""

The one character which I didn't like was the Russian instructor, Anton.  Every time he called Kate by the Russian version of her name, Katya, I thought to myself, ""Her name is Kate, you stereotypical dumb foreigner!  KATE!""

Far-fetched, but cute, is my final review.  ""Chick flick"" is the perfect term for it.  ""Olympic glory"" would be pushing it.",1190160000,2,2446,4.511415525114155

The story seemed quite plausible including us in the drive shared by our main characters and their step by step progress through ups and downs to the very exciting conclusion. The workouts were rigorous and the skating footage very powerful and thrilling. The romantic energy was electric and compelling as well as the ache of hearts moving foward and apart in the dance of fear and indecision.

The script is corny, the acting poor, and the story line trite and uninvolving. They don't even show any extended figure skating scenes, which would have at least added a nice note as that is always fun to watch.

The dialogue between the two leads is supposed to be snappy, but with the wooden way they deliver it, it's just dopey (I'm surprised these two actors ever worked again after this film came out...) The two skaters bicker non-stop through the whole movie and then are supposed to fall in love at the end, though I didn't buy it for a minute. They are both unlikeable, as characters and as actors, so I didn't care what happened to them in the end...unless they would have fallen through the ice, which would have ended this dull ice skating  movie on the proper note.",1182038400,,921,4.443786982248521
829456,5,6304286325,"English has words for most emotions, but sometimes Italian is more effective. I saw this movie for the first time seventeen years after it came out, and I found it exactly ""Magnifico"".
Ice-skating has always represented in my immaginary one of the forms of ""gracefullness"" that can be acheived in competitive sports. Another is surely gymnastics.
This very well written movie deals with a beautiful and fascinating sport, but also adds to this advantage a story of failures, dreams, efforts and ""Great Expectations"" (Kate gives Doug this book for Christmas). The plot somewhat resembles ""The Taming of the Shrew"", with a femine character that is whitty, sassy and tempremental and a male character that steadily somehow tames her. However, we don't live in Skakespeare's times anymore, so the parity of sexes must be respected, with also the man giving in at last to love.
Nothing is more romantic than the meeting of disparities, and this is exactly what happens here.
A pretty, talented, rich, spoiled and introverse young figure skater, Kate Mosely, finds herself without a partner. Thanks to the long eye of her Russian trainer, she has the occasion of trying out the retired hockey player Doug Dorsey, that slightly intimidated by the girl and the situation, but at the same time desiring to skate again and compete decides to pair up with her in the attempt to qualify for the Olympic games.
One of the points of force of this movie is the dialogue between the couple which is fast, humoristic and a pleasure to follow. Another is the evident attraction between the actors which goes right to the heart.
The scenography is also very good, with the winter scenes that add magic to the atmosphere and the training scenes with the skaters alone on the rink.
Obviously some of the sport scenes are impossible, as skaters have rightly pointed out, and the plot resolves as expected, but I believe this movie can be classified as a romantic classic and will stand the test of time.",1179273600,3,1981,4.863905325443787

829459,4,6304286325,"The Cutting Edge is one of those break out feel good movies you can watch anytime and it's still as much fun today as the first time I saw it in 1992.

""Doug Dorsey"" played with verve by D.B. Sweeney, is a rising hockey star with a bright future ahead him until a freak accident on the ice shatters his chances of playing at the peak of the competitive level. It's not long before Doug is noticed by skating coach ""Anton Pamchenko"" Roy Dotrice, an affable personality whom the audience gravitates to from the start. Pamchenko brings Mr. Dorsey to the estate of Kate Moseley, Moira Kelly, a would-have been gold medalist at the 1984 Winter Games in Sarajevo. She blamed her former partner for their loss and never fully recovered, you see. Kate has an acerbic tongue that's as sharp as her blades. She has issues welcoming a new partner and Doug is no exeception. The two meet and a hostile alliance is soon formed as they begin practice sessions. Doug isn't used to figure skates and Kate takes full advantage of this by ""missing"" serveral connections in the routines which cause him to painfully contact the ice. Each time he falls, Kate skates by teasing him uttering ""Toe pick."" One of my favorite scenes in the movie. Doug is made of quite stern stuff and  soon turns the tables on Kate in a harmless way during an impromtu ""hockey game"" played on her private indoor rink.

Having ironed out the roughness, the two become quite polished and a budding romance ensues between them. The question is, do they have what it takes to become 1988 Olympic Champions in pairs figure skating?

The acting is charming and the soundtrack first rate. I would have given it five stars except for the ending, which I won't give away here.

Her desperate Russian coach finds the hockey player who has the strength, stamina and spirit to skate with her, but he takes an instant dislike to her spoiled disposition and condescending temperament. The coach is convinced that both are partners who can bring home the elusive Olympic gold in figure-skating. The sparks fly.

The chemistry between D. B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly is instantaneous. Their evolution to a skating pair is filled with competition between them at every turn. The on-screen tension between the two build as the Nationals and Olympics draw nearer. (It doesn't hurt that Moira Kelly is actually an accomplished skater.)

Sorry! You'll have to see the DVD because my narrative ends here. You will enjoy this drama-comedy of budding romance unless you don't have a romantic lace in your ice skates.

829575,4,6304286325,"I remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since.  The movie starts off at the 1988 Calgary Olympics.  Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeny) is a talented hockey player and Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) is a pairs figure skater.  Both have mishaps during their big moments, Doug suffering a career ending injury and Kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations.

The movie picks up a few years later with Kate having trouble getting a new partner and Doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player.  Added to the mix is Kate's Russian couch Anton Pamchenko (played by the great Roy Dotrice) who decides Rick will be Kate's new partner as they struggle to get back to the 1992 Olympics.

At first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating, but that is not entirely so.  The scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater.  In truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice.  It is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another, to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love.  The thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads Sweeney and Kelly.  They are magic together on the screen, so much so that I am surprised they never paired up again for another movie.

I highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone.

On a side note about the DVD, the only special feature is the theatrical trailer.  There are no deleted scenes.  This is where I have a question, because the version of the film on this DVD and that I've scene on TV in recent years is not the one I remember seeing in college.  I distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony.  I somewhat like that version because what Doug and Kate won in that version was so much more.

829577,4,6304286325,"Just as ""Ice Castles"" had inspired a generation of ice-skaters in the late-70s', in 1992 the romantic comedy THE CUTTING EDGE created a similar effect when it burst onto the screen.  An hilarious and touching movie, filled with great performances and a well-handled screenplay by Tony Gilroy.

Doug Dorsey (played by D.B. Sweeney) is an injured former hockey player, who finds himself playing skate-partner to tiresome, pampered prima donna Kate Moseley (Moira Kelly).  Before you can say ""double axle"", Kate begins her systematic plan to get rid of Doug using whatever means possible...but she doesn't count on Doug being every bit as tough as she is!  As the pair begin to skate towards Olympic glory, could their fiery, ""Odd Couple"" relationship ever blossom into love?

829682,5,6304286325,"I have loved this movie since I first saw it in the theater multiple times as it was so damn good!

I was thrilled beyond belief to read in Entertainment Weekly that a new Special Edition DVD was coming out today.  I didn't know, and was also thrilled to see -- for those of you who (also) didn't know it already -- that the FULL SCORE was FINALLY released on the Deluxe Edition CD Soundtrack Release and I picked-up both today!

As for this Gold Metal Edition -- and for all you similarly panicked collectors -- PLEASE DO NOT PANIC!  Amazon made a MISTAKE in the listing, The Gold Metal Edition presents the film in its WIDESCREEN FORMAT and not the erroneously reported Full Screen Format.

The DVD includes the original trailer, the trailer for the sequel, and a brief 10 minute retrospective featuring Moira and D.B. but (regrettably) does not include Roy or Terry.  A more comprehensive Cast/Director featurette/commentary would have been good to have -- there's no commentary at all -- but I'm very grateful that we got a decent Special Edition as well as the Deluxe Release of the Soundtrack with the Full Score.  Still, it's better that we got what we did 15 years late rather than never having gotten it at all!

This movie holds up amazingly well because of the acting, music, and skating sequences and it's a fairly realistic portrayal of relational dynamics and the triumph of hope over despair, triumph over tragedy, and love over hate.  Considering how bad Ice Castles sucked I never thought I could love a skating movie until I saw this one.  Interestingly, Moira mentions that she gets moved at the same point I always do which is the big ""Kate, I need you... I NEED YOU!"" scene.

As to the sequel, solid casting of Scott Thompson Baker and Stefanie Kramer as a 20 years later version of Kate & Doug bodes quite well for it since any sequel had the potential to be a complete and total disaster.  Kramer and Baker are hardly an impossible-to-believe-it set of casting choices for an older Kate & Doug.  However, one does have to wonder why they didn't/couldn't just bring back D.B. and Moira since it is the movie that basically made them!  Interestingly, in the retrospective, D.B. looks EXACTLY the same and Moira looks like she's aged a bit.

It's a fairly inexpensive purchase to get this new Gold Metal Edition and it's so worth it when you think of how much the film has meant to all of us and to a new generation.",1141084800,10,2436,4.567816091954023

It is full of great movie quotes since through most of the movie the two main characters seem to hate each other and express themselves as such.

The story is pretty much that two VERY different people (Kate is a snobby rich girl who is used to getting everything the way she wants it, and Doug is a rough, tell it like it is womanizing guy) hoping for olympic medals mess up big time 1 year and their only hope for next time is each other--and of course they don't get along, and fight about everything including the outfits and music, but their coach comes up with a new routine that if done correctly could blow everyone away and is a sure win--if they can get along long enough to practice it until they can perfect it.

When it origianlly premiered in the movie theaters back in 1992, I was 12 and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, so about 10 years later I decided to buy it on DVD. That was definitely a mistake! This movie lacks a lot of the sophistication that an adult viewer may appreciate. After seeing it again as an adult I realize how unrealistic, over dramatic and predictable this film is. I mean to start with, how and why did an Olympic level pairs skater become partners with an injured hockey player to begin with? In real life that would obviously never happen. The movie has a few funny moments, however it's very cheezy. Truly a disappointment. If you insist on seeing this movie, I would highly recommend renting it first.",1076889600,,892,4.546583850931677
829806,4,6304286325,"It's hard to say exactly why this little movie is such a charmer, but it is.  It was only a modest success when first released, but has gone on to become something of a cult favorite on video and cable, enough so that a sound-track CD was released several years after the movie.
Perhaps part of the reason is that it combines two well-known and durable genres, the underdog sports movie and the romantic comedy of mismatched opposites.  He is Doug Dorsey, an Olympic hockey player from a mining town in northern Minnesota, knocked out of a pro career by a minor eye injury, who is apparently irresistible to all the ladies, except for her.  She is Kate Moseley, an upper class pairs figure skater who missed out on Olympic gold by falling in the long program, whose sharp tongue has driven away all her potential partners.  Out of desperation, her coach recruits the hockey player to be her new partner.  As the script actually acknowledges, this premise stretches credulity, but then this is basically a fairy tale anyway (as are most romantic comedies, if you think about it).  Will the hockey player be able to convert to an Olympic level pairs figure skater?  Will they skate for Olympic gold?  Will they bicker and insult each other and fall in love despite themselves?  No points for incorrect guesses.
If the ending is predictable, and the subsidiary players are stock (the gruff but wise coach, the gay male skating partner, the pushy father, the upper class boy friend), then perhaps the answer is that getting there is fun, with some twists and turns thanks to a funny script by Tony Gilroy, and terrific chemistry between D.B. Sweeney as Doug and Moira Kelly as Kate. Sweeney does an excellent job playing a guy who is an egotistical jock (""There are only two things I do really well, sweetheart, and skating's the other one!""), a bit crude, but who also has a sweet side to him.  Kelly delivers her bitchy lines with flair (""What is this, last stages of Ukranian Alcohol Psychosis?"") but also shows a very appealing vulnerability. Their interaction carries us through a pretty stock and predictable plot and makes it believable.  Among the memorable scenes between them are a series of skating sequences in which the only dialog is the words ""toe pick"", their exchange of Christmas presents, the two of them getting a case of the nerves at the Nationals, their celebration afterwards, and of course, the lead-up to the climactic Olympic skate at the end.  The sharp-eyed may be able to catch three scenes that feature a Bobby Hull Black Hawk hockey sweater which deftly underlines the emotional progression.  Incidentally, the Nationals and Olympic pairs skating sequences feature genuine international competition level skaters and are choreographed by Olympic champion Robin Cousins, who also has a cameo as a commentator at the Nationals.
A real feel-good guilty pleasure movie which holds up well to repeated viewings, a great chick flick and the perfect date movie.  The DVD is pretty basic; although it has a choice of French and Spanish subtitles and dubbing, the only extra is the theatrical trailer, which has a couple seconds that were cut out of the movie itself.",1067644800,10,3186,4.843462246777164

829888,5,6304286325,"The Cutting Edge is one of those rare movies that  becomes more enjoyable with each viewing.  The plot, like any good plot, is very simple.  A wild and wayward upcoming Hockey Star, gets blind-sided, abrupting his blossoming career and severely mitigating his devotion to hedonism.  With few options, he hires on as the new partner of a professional figure skater, whose East Coast life of fiscal-privelege, and discipline, while  diamentrically opposite to Sweeney's cream-corn and cube-steak background has rendered her virtually optionless.

In the course of their working towards their common goal (going to the olympics) they fall in love.  It's a classic love story, launching from extreme conflict that fosters personal growth,  confronting truth and  fears, etc.
The Cutting Edge is not the typical ""Heterosexual-White-Male"" centric movie, and would probably leave a bad taste in the mouths of  your generic straight male movie goer,  because Sweeney, not Kelly, his female counterpart is physically objectized in this movie.  Kelly's most attractive qualities are cerebral, more so than mammilary-related, and that's a notion that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of most men because our social endoctrination is conflictive with that.
The movie was rich with symbolism; Sweeney representing hedonism at its extreme, the professional figure-skater the pinnacle of  too much discipline.  Their developing love mitigates both characters'  behavioral posturing.  The turning point being when the two characters get drunk, and Kelly offers Sweeney sex, which he declines because of the situation.  Such integrity does not sit well with men. ... The evening culminates with Sweeney having a casual sexual encounter with a rival figure skater, which is a pyrhicc victory at best. NOT A BOY THING.  We don't want that kind of enlightenment.  Do not make us feel.  Do not make us reconsider what we've learned from Madison Avenue's best Commercial Advertising Campaign and The Porn Channels...
We know Sweeney wants Kelly.  So why didn't he take her when he had her?  The disturbing conclusion is that  the appeal of a woman e.g., Kelly's character might extend beyond carnality is VERY MUCH NOT A BOY THING!!
The very idea that the onus of preserving the integrity of a love relationship is not solely the female's responsibility and that  there may be times when the man has to assume custody of that responsiblity is very much NOT A BOY THING.
It only requires minimal sexual experience to know that you can't make love to a drunk.  That notion is very contrary to the image of men and the image of women that  has served Madison Avenue and the Box Office so well.  The notion that  honesty is the fundamental currency of love, and that love is the key that unlocks the strength to overcome life's obstacles and achieve one's potential, IS NOT A BOY-THING.
And there's other problems as well, the idea that men have the potential to display virtue (even if only for a moment) and that women can be strong, and attractive without being blonde, top-heavy or both, again IS NOT A BOY THING.
It's a great movie, if you can think outside the ""Box"" Office.  But you need to be attentive, intelligent and available to intrinsic human emotion moreso  than intrinsic social endoctrination.  So like I said, NOT A BOY THING... but its very much a man thing.",1051315200,,3350,5.025408348457351

This is definitely a wonderful example of the basic ""Old Fashioned Romance"" genre of movies that builds its characters sufficiently to be believable, has characters that you come to like as the story progresses, centers on a relationship that evolves from animosity to love, and ultimately has an ending that leaves you feeling good.  Similar in some aspects to the Anne Heche/Harrison Ford vehicle ""6 Days and 7 Nights"", Cutting Edge delivers more warmth and ultimately can bring a tear to your eye at the climax even though you know how it is going to end long before it does.

As time goes on, however, they realize how good they are together and all looks well until they hit one more hurdle. On the night they qualify for the Qlympics, a drunken Kate decides to make her skating partner her sexual partner. But because she's drunk, Doug won't give in to her advances, which makes her angry.

Sweeney and the lovely Moira Kelly, two very underrated actors, this movie will keep the viewer entertained. The story revolves around two athletes. One is a top notch, Olympic level, ice hockey player, who sees his potential professional career go down the tubes, when he is injured during the Olympics. The other is the female half of a pairs figure skating team, who choked during the Olympics, ending their quest for the gold.

Both are not doing well after their own personal waterloo. He is now playing with amatuer teams, as his injury precludes him from going pro. She, a total prima donna, is busy, going through one skating partner after another with no success. Her coach, knowing that the ex hockey player has a lot of skating talent, contacts him in hopes that maybe he will be the one that will be able to work with his temperamental, Olympic hopeful. He agrees and goes to work on learning the niceties of figure skating. She goes to work on learning to get along with him. Together, they are working towards earning an Olympic Gold medal.

There are some delightfully funny and heartwarming scenes in this film. Probably the funniest is the toe pick scene. When you see the film, you will know what I mean.

829978,4,6304286325,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, and I was pleased as punch to see it come out on DVD.  For those of you not familiar with it, the story is of the figure-skating diva that can't find a partner, who suddenly meets her match in Doug Dorsey, a washed up hockey-player brimming with testosterone.  They meet, they bicker, they fall in love. Badda-boom, badda-bing.  This is more of a 'chick' movie than a guy movie, but it's entertaining for the entire family, IMO.
Two things keep me from giving this DVD the 5 stars it deserves : One is cinematic, and one is something else.
1. The ending abruptly cuts off, leaving you to 'guess' how it ends.  Some folks prefer an ending like this--I do not.  I want it spelled out for me!
2.  There are hardly any 'special features' on this DVD.  The only one is the movie trailer.  If you're looking to get the DVD for all the special add-ins, skip this one.

829979,5,6304286325,"Our 5 yr. old son recently took up skating.  He now demands that we take hime to the rink every weekend, in addition to his regular lessons.  Last weekend, my wife performed the most graceless belly flop on ice I have ever seen.  After I picked myself up off the ground and replaced her on the ice, I managed to one-up her with two full twists, arms and legs flapping before I slammed into the ice and skidded to a stop against the boards.
Lying there on the ice, laughing at myself, one phrase was all that could come to mind, ""toe pick"" in a light, lilting, completely condecending voice.  Boy can I relate to D.B. Sweeney's character in this wonderful, family film.  The pain in my knee as I tried to right myself on the ice brought flashbacks of the training scenes and the visible determination of the skaters to try and make a bad situation work.  The dynamics thrum on multiple layers as Doug and Kate learn how to skate together, relate to each other, love themselves, and, finally, love each other.
The acting is excellent, the story is fun and the skating is ok.  But, these two actors, given the same situation and any other sport, could work the same movie magic.  The chemistry is perfect.  All of the primary actors are strong and communicate the emotions of the moment without need of dialogue to muck it up.
We do not yet own this DVD, but I will certainly buy so that my wife and I can chant together, in sinch. with the movie... ""toe pick.""  Men, this is not just a ""chick flic.""  You to can enjoy a romance, even if you don't want to admit it.",1016755200,,1562,4.333333333333333
829980,5,6304286325,"If you are looking for a movie with delicious tension and a focus on Winter Olympics, you can't really go wrong with this romance.

Kate Mosley (Moira Kelly) needs a figure skating partner and Doug Dorsey (D.B. Sweeney) seems willing to try something new. In fact, he says he even actually likes figure skating after he figures out he has a talent for the sport.

Through the story, Kate and Doug learn to deal with their different backgrounds and find common ground. While their relationship seems doomed from the start, somehow they manage to skate over the thin ice and reach a place that is warm and secure.

What I liked most about this movie is that Doug doesn't take advantage of Kate when she is at her most vulnerable point in the movie. He also really wants to succeed and is willing to put up with Kate's moods in order to get there.

If you are looking for a romance that won't make men yawn, this is it! I could watch this movie over and over again. It is timeless. The characters also make all the right choices in the end.

Kate is a figure skater who is getting to the fine line between olympic competitive figure skating and Disney on Ice.

829986,4,6304286325,"This is a charming, if somewhat predictable, movie. With wonderful performances by the sexy D.B. Sweeney and the lovely Moira Kelly, two very underrated actors, this movie will keep the viewer entertained. The story revolves around two athletes. One is a top notch, Olympic level, ice hockey player, who sees his potential professional career go down the tubes, when he is injured during the Olympics. The other is the female half of a pairs figure skating team, who choked during the Olympics, ending their quest for the gold.
Both are not doing well after their own personal waterloo. He is now playing with amatuer teams, as his injury precludes him from going pro. She, a total prima donna, is busy, going through one skating partner after another with no success. Her coach, knowing that the ex hockey player has a lot of skating talent, contacts him in hopes that maybe he will be the one that will be able to work with his temperamental Olympic hopeful. He agrees and goes to work on learning the niceties of figure skating. She goes to work on learning to get along with him. Together, they are working towards earning an Olympic Gold medal.
There are some delightfully funny and heartwarming scenes in this film. Probably the funniest is the toe pick scene. When you see the film, you will know what I mean.

Doug is a retired ice hockey player due to an eye injury, which made it impossible for him to play the game anymore.  When he is offered the chance to be a figure skater  with a girl who is seeking a new partner for competition, he's not interested at first.  He ends up accepting the offer and it turns out that his partner is nothing but a spoilt prima donna who is a bad tempered brat used to getting her own way by constantly throwing tantrums.  Well, it seems the reason she needed a new partner was because she had driven all of her old partners away for some reason or other.  She nearly achieves the same with Doug but he hangs tough and gives back as good as he gets.  Through a lot of ups and downs, smiles and tears, Kate and Doug are at the Nationals but are barely talking after a huge fight but, all ends well when Doug tells Kate just as they're about to enter the ice rink for the final contest, he loves her! There are tears, on screen and off, then all ends well!  This was a great film.

That, in a nut shell is the basic premise behind this movie, but the journey of getting there is the real heart of this movie.
 The romance which develops between the two lead characters adds nothing new to the genre and follows the standard formula almost to the letter.  The initial hostility they shared towards one another at the beginning, the byplay that develops as they get to know one another, the leading towards romance, the inevitable misunderstanding, and then finally getting together.  However, the two leads are both attractive people, and they have a strong onscreen chemistry together which makes their romance seem believable, and a joy to watch.
 The figure skating in the movie is highly enjoyable to watch, even for someone like me who isn't into figure skating as a general rule.  I do have to wonder whether the finishing move they use at the end of the movie is really possible to pull off though.  It might have just been me, but I couldn't see how they could have pulled off enough momentum to really do the move, because it didn't really look like it could have worked to me.  However, that's only a minor complaint, and the move did look good, so whether or not it's physically possible isn't only a secondary concern.
 So, if you enjoy romance movies, and have some liking for figure skating, I recommend you check this movie out for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.",983664000,2,1644,4.657439446366782

True, some of the scenes in the film may not be 'accurate' in portraying ice skating tournaments and such, but that isn't exactly the focus of the film now is it? I only have two minor gripes with this film; Since it's never announced whether they won or not, there could have been a great sequel pulled out of it.  (Well maybe not a great sequel, but who'd like to see one regardless?)  The only other point I have to raise is that neither Sweeney or Kelly have made anything as good since.

I'm so happy to see that this great film is FINALLY available on DVD!
I've been a fan of romance movies forever, epsecially films in which two characters from different backgrounds find each other and fall in love. Moira Kelly and D.B Sweeney made their roles as stubborn primadonna and a just as stubborn former hockey player so believable that when they finally do get together all you can do is cheer them on.
I liked how the film showed that both characters were pushed into their dreams; Kate always feeling that skating was the only way to make her father love her and that winning a gold medal was the only way to answer her mothers dying wishes. Then there is Doug; growing up in a family of Hockey players and having to feel as if he let them down when he could no longer play professionally.
Both characters learned to believe in themselves and along the way believe in one another, and end the end falling in love, all thanks to one little thing known as a toepick.:)",980985600,9,1211,4.45945945945946

Really the whole cast is first rate, but the chemistry between D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly really shines. You know of course they belong together, but watching them figure that out is most of the fun. The skating is super. Why Paul Glaser doesn't do more films is beyond me.

830177,5,6304286325,"From the start, The Cutting Edge is more watchable to a wider audience than most of the romance genre because it's not entirely a romance. In part it's also a sports film--it's about training for the ultimate goal.
D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly, both highly underrated actors, breathe charm and life into their characters. Not in spite of but because of their flaws these characters are likeable: Doug Dorsey for his coping with having his dream snatched out from under him, and Kate for all her focus and hard work bent towards a dream that isn't even hers. As they both grow into their new roles, both the romance and the team develop. Because they pull no punches with each other, neither the bond between them nor their performance as a team feels false.
On top of everything else, it's a great winter film. For some reason, watching winter sports (like the winter Olympics, in this case) really takes the edge off the winter blahs and makes the snow and ice seem fun again.

At least they fall in love with each other, rather than inflicting themselves on others.  (When it pops up on cable from time to time, I find it curiously watchable, because it has the innocuous blandness and careful inoffensiveness of a good TV show, and sometimes I'm just in the mood for that.

I felt it was inspirational and certainly was more about the romance between the two main characters than it was about the figure skating. The main memory I have of this is the fateful 'pemchenko twist' or something like that. The most daring figure skating move ever to hit the ice. With all of the comedy that was presented with the movie and certainly with the atheletic ability of the actors this movie was definately a good choice. I have watched this at least 5 times and will watch it again. It was first released relatively clsoe to the winter olypmics in '92 and certainly caught some spark from that but generally was a sleeper hit. At least to me.

And you have to allow  your mind to allow that fiction in a fictional movie.  As far as the  transformation of a hockey player into a figure skater in 4 years is not  that hard at all, cause you've got to understand that he already was a good  skater to begin with.  The only he had to learn was grace in his moves and  how to use a toe pick.

830243,5,6304286325,"The Cutting Edge was a wonderful combination of comedy and romance with  both actors displaying a sense for comical flair and believable sexual  tension. Although somewhat predictable, this movie does not give in so  quickly to the characters obvious attraction, and allows it to unfold  naturally, sticking close to how I believe Kate and Doug, had they been  real, would behave.  When first deciding to watch the movie I was somewhat sceptical but was  pleasantly surprised by  both director and the actors ability to light up  the screen with a funny script that so easily could have ended up in the  wrong hands.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good movie thats not  too taxing. Its definately one of my faves.",959817600,,723,4.788617886178862
830244,5,6304286325,"This was one of the most romantic, good feel movies I have ever seen.  It follows a similar story to that strictly Ballroom, but ten times better. If you love movies like the aforementioned and Dirty Dancing then you must see  this.  The flm forms great character development due to an excellent script  which is delivered brilliantly by an inspired cast.  You find yourself  almost bonding with the characters which means you really do get involved  in the movie, almost to the point where it feels like reality.
I really  hope that this will get a DVD release soon as I find it hard to think of a  more deserving film.  But don't wait, get the vhs version now.",956707200,,662,4.487394957983193

830304,5,6304286325,"My family and friends constantly mock me for loving this film, but their opinions matter little.  To me this film is not addictive because of the love story, but because of the athletic come-from-behind victory theme.  Athletes can relate to the competitive nature of the two main characters  whose desires to ""beat"" the other draw them inextricably  together.  The verbal repartee is wonderful, the skating is exciting, and  the attraction depicted between Sweeney and Kelly is real and palpable from  the first moments.  Bottom line: this film combines the ever-popular  against-all-odds love with underdog-wins archetypes quite successfully.  Love it!",951955200,6,654,5.515151515151516
830305,5,6304286325,"Normally romantic comedies bore me. I just can not stand the sentimentality; but this one was just great. Two sympathetic leads, portraying realistic characters, great scating scenes and a solid, if  somewhat predictable plot make this a very pleasant movie to see. In its  sort is the Cutting Edge probably the best movie ever made. A special  compliment should go to the stuntscaters who did a magnificent job",951782400,3,411,5.014705882352941

830307,5,6304286325,"I LOVE this movie. It was the first vdeo I ever bought for myself and is one of the sweetest, most romantic, and funniest movies I've seen. DB Sweeney is gorgeous as the loveable, girl chasing,less than brilliant  ex-hockey god, and Moira Kelly plays an excellent, evil, spoiled typical  rich primadonna figure skater from Connecticut. Techncally, it is hard to  believe a hockey player could be transformed into a figure skater, but view  it with an open mind and you will fall in love with this movie too!",947808000,3,507,4.7272727272727275
830308,5,6304286325,"This is a great, great movie for anyone who likes romances with a little bite to them... No wilting flower heroine here!  Kate (Moira Kelly) is a class A witch!  She is demanding, selfish and self-involved, but she is a wonderful ice-skater... And one in need of a partner.  Doug (DB Sweeny) is- well- he's a little simpler, and a little less high-maintenence, but he's also a great skater, and one who can no longer play hockey... So they pair up, and the sparks start flying.
This is such a fun movie-- I'd have to compare the dynamic between these two to that between Han and Leia.  It's definately a ""love/hate"" relationship, but they are perfectly matched, both on ice and off... Watch it if you love romance, watch it if you love to laugh... Fair warning, after I saw it for the first time, I went out and signed up for ice skating lessons!",945734400,2,846,4.438709677419355

830363,5,6304286325,"I first got interested in watching figure skating about 2 years ago.  One night, I had to chose between this movie and a figure skating competition.  I chose to watch the competition and went to look at my TV Guide to see  when the movie would show again.  About 6 months later I watched the movie  on TV and halfway through I realized that it had been a big mistake on my  part not to tape it.  After that, knowing that TV presentations cut out soe  of the movie for commercials, I went to buy the video.  I watched the darn  thing an average of 3 times a day for the next 3 weeks.  God it was  addicting.  I bought the soundtrack not so long ago and have been listening  to it while I watch the movie.  D.B Sweeney and Moira Kelly do a great job  on the screen.  I wish some professional figure skaters would try to do the  ""Pamchienko Twist"".  I especially love the part in the movie when  Doug disses Mozart.  I also crack up every time when I see the part where  Doug is all throwing up at Nationals.  You gotta go watch this movie at  least once.  I guarantee that you will never be able to just watch it once.  TOEPICK!!!!!!!",922492800,2,1132,4.125

I also want every one to know that you  have got to get this movie or atleast rent the dang thing , that way you  can see the movie when ever you want and you don't have to pay a single  penny. Anyone that doesn't see this movie within 20 days will be cursed by  the devil and by me.
