2453135,4,B000C65Z8Y,"all in all a terrific movie, but i don't feel everything was truthful.  one scene has joe dimaggio slapping marilyn across the face, and i'm not buying he ever did that.  and also, i think this movie overexagerates on her sex life...i don't think she slept around with as many guys as this movie says...but very compelling and in some scenes poppy montgomery actually does look just like her.  but overall the best 'marilyn' movie i've seen and i'm a huge fan of hers, but i felt the movie did a small disservice to her memory with these 'bending the truths' a little, especially since she is no longer alive and can't defend herself.  so 4 stars, but def. worth getting a copy.",1161993600,3,678,4.487804878048781
2453136,4,B000C65Z8Y,"Poppy Montgomery did a wonderful job acting in this film. I really enjoyed being a diehard Marilyn fan myself, but...there are a few flaws in the film. Some of the sequences and dates in the film don't exactly happen as it really did. As with any other hollywood film the real story was switched around to fit the director's prespective. I thought it was good but not good enough. If you want an *idea* of what Marilyn was like this would be good. But for the accurate and unaltered story I suggest picking up a book about her.",1148774400,11,527,4.387755102040816

2453188,5,B000C65Z8Y,"Okay. For starters this isn't a documentary or a biography style film about Marilyn. Some of the characters were real people and some of the situations real, but for the most part it is a work of fiction. For instance they changed the name of her real life agent Johnny Hyde. They also never mention Joe DiMaggio or Arthur Miller by name at all. With all that being said, honestly, I thought it was a great story. Poppy Montgomery didn't do too bad of a job playing Marilyn. They got a lot of Marilyn's emotional hang ups right; her constant search for a father figure within her love life, her intense insecurity, and the fact that she never really felt the persona of Marilyn Monroe suited her. It just wasn't her.",1395014400,6,716,4.473282442748092
2453189,5,B000C65Z8Y,"Poppy really was the part. I bought the movie because Kristie Alley was cast in it ,her part was small but she was very convincing playing it and worth watching. Overall movie was interesting.",1380067200,,192,4.676470588235294
2453190,5,B000C65Z8Y,One of the best Marilyn Monroe movies about her life I seen.. Poppy Montgomery did a super job. As you watch this movie you believe your watching Marilyn,1377129600,,153,4.5
2453191,4,B000C65Z8Y,"The novel ""Blonde"" was my first foray into the world of Marilyn Monroe, inspiring me to read any and everything about her. True, it's not 100 percent accurate (maybe not even 75 percent), but it's entertaining no less. The novel has a polarizing effect on Marilyn fans, and I'm sure the film will do the same.

Although I loved Michelle Williams in ""My Week With Marilyn,"" I think Poppy Montgomery looks and sounds much more like Marilyn. This will sound silly, but the reason I held off ordering this DVD is because Montgomery doesn't look even remotely like Monroe on the cover. Yeah, yeah. I know. I'm glad I got over it, though. There are times in the film when the resemblance is absolutely incredible. Therein lies the problem.

Montgomery is perfectly cast, which makes the miscast characters so much more unsettling. It's not that the men portraying DiMaggio and Arthur Miller aren't good actors. The problem is that they look absolutely NOTHING like the real men--two men whose faces are very well known. So if you're the type who knows all about Marilyn and the famous faces in her relationships, their scenes together just seem...off.

As closely as Montgomery resembles Marilyn, you would expect that the supporting cast in a movie about her life (albeit a fictional one) would be at least half as spot-on. Instead, it's like watching the real Marilyn Monroe play to totally random people. It's a major distraction in a movie that would otherwise receive a five-star rating.",1375315200,,1486,4.865612648221344

2453216,1,B000C65Z8Y,"All I can say is this movie is crappy and doesn't do Marilyn Monroe justice at all or tell the truth about her life!!! If you're a dedicated and die hard fan like me I only have this to say:DONT BOTHER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Go rent or buy My Week With Marilyn instead. I have seen it 12 times at least and I would watch it 50 more times then bother with this film at all. It ought to be condemned in my view. Montgomery just looks like another impersonator in a wig and making Marilyn seem like a joke and just a showoff as well as a tramp. Marilyn wanted to be taken seriously as an actress and struggled throughout her whole short life to stay away from the sterotype of being just another dumb blond in Hollywood and sex symbol. She once said to a reporter shortly before she passed away:""Please don't make me a joke."" Well I honestly think this movie as well as Montgomery's portrayal makes her look like one. Marilyn was very smart woman despite her poor upbringing, little education,and her sad childhood. She even had a higher IQ then John F. Kennedy, President of the United States, at the time of her death. I would like to see ths movie and many other crappy ones show beyond that: the sweet, lonely, and insecure woman she was. Sure it does at times but makes her seem just like a replica of herself. Michelle Williams delivered a brilliant and accurate portrayal of Marilyn in My Week With Marilyn and even won the golden globe award for best actress: the same award Marilyn herself won 50 years ago. I think Williams took the role more seriously and put all of her strength and energy in playing the role of the most famous women of our time and studied Marilyn's life and personality and characteristics as much as she could. Do any of other actresses playing her even take the time to watch some of Marilyn's well-known movies like The Seven Year Itch or Some Like It Hot? Maybe but again maybe not. They should and more importantly learn much as they can about her and learn to be Marilyn themselves instead of just acting like another woman in a blond wig, red lips, wiggly walk, and sexy voice. Any actress in the world would kill for this playing Marilyn Monroe in a movie based on her and this is the best they can do?? UGH!! I think the producers would do stand a better chance of pleasing an audience and her fans if they did a film based on the truth of her life instead of insane crap like this and hire Michelle Williams to play the part. The trouble is nowadays Hollywood big bosses don't give a darn about accuracy in their films: just earning enough money at the boxoffice so they can fill their wallets and bring home the bacon. I am soooooooooooooooooo fed up with this!!! Hollywood doing Marilyn injustice and only see dollar signs in their heads. Bet Billy Wilder could direct a better film on Marilyn if he was still alive especially since he directed her in 2 films that I just mentioned above. I am about ready to buy all of the copies on this film and other films based on MM except My Week With Marilyn and burn them in my fireplace but it's not worth the time or the money to buy this filth. I am a huge fan of Marilyn and know just about everything there is to know. I am only 21 one but she is my compassion and huge part of my life. To me she isn't a cashcow: just a star and a woman who deserves respect and her right to twinkle. Marilyn was used and taken advantage enough in her lifetime: does she have to be treated worse in death? Gosh!! Let her rest in peace and give her some respect. If I could I would complain to the studio who created this garbage and hold a protect and burn the copies in front of their shocked faces!! Sorry for rambling on but I love Marilyn Monroe and it hurts me to the core when she is treated like this. She was afterall a member of the Actors Studio for a time and took dramatic lessons with Lee Strasberg in New York and became obsessed with the Method. Didn't bother to show that and the Agathy Christine performance she gave at the studio which all of the memembers said was the best performance of that play ever done did you? No you have to show her sleeping around with all these men and make her look like she was a slut!!! Yes she slept around some but not that much. She once said,""Men who tried to buy me off made me sick."" She was a victim of Hollywood and suffered sexual harassment: a term which hasn't yet been invented during her lifetime.""Back then it was just called life,"" quoting from Gloria Steinmen from a docuementary on Monroe. Not only that the guy playing her playwright and third husband, Arthur Miller, doesn't look like him at all: more like a busboy. Doughery Scott who played Miller in Week With Marilyn looked like him perfectly. Also the actor looks more like a heavy set gangster who plays her second husband and one of the world's famous baseball players, Joe DiMaggio. Didn't they at least do any research or just wrote the script on the book under the name on which the film is based? Wouldn't be a bit surprised. I know the book is in which it was based was supposed to be fiction but the author and the producers could have done way better then that!! Throw the book out the window and instead focus on doing a film based on the fiction account of Marilyn's death ""Bye Bye Baby."" I wasn't able to put that down once I got it and it was excellent and no accuracies as far as I could tell without checking. Would love to see a film based on that instead of this big time!!! Not worth a nickle!!! If you want to watch it don't expect it to be accurate. Oh by the way there is a scene where Marilyn had an abortion. Another inaccuracy!!! I know there's been rumors about that in some biographies but I doubt Marilyn would have done thing to a child. She loved childen dearly and despareltly wanted a child but sadly her body wouldn't allow it. She even went to Mexico to see about adopting a child before she passed away in 62. If she had lived, she may have done that and found the messing link in her life and may still be alive. It's her being a cashcow and being abused and treated like crap by Hollywood, men, reporters, producers, and directers that drove her over the edge. Wanna blame anyone over that?

2453217,1,B000C65Z8Y,This is based on a fictional book about MM so I tried to pretend it was someone else. I didn't do a very good job of it and so I thought it was awful. Poppy Montgomery is not a very good actress and this is not a good story.,1332633600,,224,3.5918367346938775

2453221,4,B000C65Z8Y,This was a truly amazing movie about Marilyn Monroe.  I had seen the movie on Lifetime Movie Network and loved it.  I looked everywhere for the movie and was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.  Poppy Montgomery does an outstanding portrayal of Marilyn Monroe. The movie was a bit long but well worth it.  I don't know how anyone could watch this movie and not fall in love with Marilyn Monroe.  Outstanding!,1212019200,10,408,4.534246575342466
2453222,2,B000C65Z8Y,"A lot of the 'facts' that this mini-series tries to put across are inaccurate, and on a totally unrelated matter, the lead actress looks nothing like her character. As charming as Poppy Montgomery (from TV's ""Without A Trace"") is, she does not remotely resemble Marilyn Monroe. Also, the storytelling in this biopic seems frightfully rushed; and it seems at times that the film-makers were frantically trying to condense Miss Oates' book. However, the cast is very talented, and make a good job of it. Overall, 2/5. The production design is the real stand-out, however, especially the re-staging of the ""Diamond's Are A Girl's Best Friend"" number from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The song 'Happy Birthday, Mr. President' sang at President Kennedy's birthday part is well done, and (thankfully, rather than making the movie delve into conspiracy theories surrounding Monroe's death) ends the movie.",1203292800,,895,5.309859154929577
2453223,3,B000C65Z8Y,"It seems that most die-hard Marilyn Monroe fans dislike this movie because it doesn't tell her true story, and it bends some facts and dates to fit the story. While that's true, you have to remember that this is based on Joyce Carol Oates novel, ""Blonde"", which is a fictional account of Marilyn Monroe's life. The novel and the movie are both intended as works of fiction and shouldn't be read as a biography of her life and work. If that's what you're looking for, then pick up a biography (you have plenty to choose from). Otherwise, this is a decent, entertaining movie. Personally, I prefer the novel, but I'm a pretty big fan of Joyce Carol Oates.",1173744000,29,653,4.5423728813559325
