201100,1,1604865229,"I put this in my watchlist because I enjoy political and historical documentaries. This was more of a left wing propaganda film that only explores the subject from the perspective of the radical left.  While some of the information presented is historically accurate, most of the film consists of the opinions of  = and a trainload of un-evidenced assertions by - radical left wing activists with a political agenda.  BTW most people recognize the difference between legitimate social justice advocacy and militant, violent gunslinging radicals advocating a blood soaked revolution..  This film does not adequately explore this distinction and in my view by virtue of the repeated references to those advocating violent revolution as merely ""social activists"" attempts to gloss over this very important distinction. For this and other reasons I give it 1 star as historical documentary and 4 stars as radical left-wing propaganda attempting to paint the United States as an evil oppressive fascist dictatorship, and 5 stars as alternative reality fantasy fiction.",1473379200,,1063,5.424242424242424

201102,5,1604865229,"You get more than 2 hours of information in one short documentary. I grew up in the 60's, and thought I'd be seeing history that I already knew. Instead, I discovered that I only knew about a quarter of what was presented here. The history presented in this movie is critically important, so much so that it should be required viewing in high school history classes. Another plus is that it's certainly not boring or dry.

But COINTELPRO was such a vast program that another movie could have been made which chose to present completely different FBI atrocities. The doc focuses too much on the FBI's war against the Black Panthers, and too little on the FBI's dirty tricks against the white hippies. For example, there was nothing about all the hippie-run underground newspapers which got blown up by the feds.

Why does this matter? Because the Feds got worried by King, Chavez, and Peltier. But they didn't get seriously worried until tens of millions of their own children rose up and rebelled against them. The 60's wouldn't have mattered a tenth as much if it had only been about civil rights.

Besides, look at the one-star reviews. They're all Fox News types who are basically saying, ""What about all the discrimination against the poor whites, especially poor white men?""",1470268800,,1279,4.804545454545455

201114,4,1604865229,"The activists of this era are almost never presented straight. They are (depending on your perspective) either : idealized or marginalized. Government admission of guilt regarding COINTELPRO always strikes me as underwhelming or even dismissive. Like copping to misdemeanor jaywalking. Some hearings result but no real redress. State power grows. Now we have PATRIOT ACT and Homeland Security Act and Much of what was illegal under COINTELPRO has been codified as legal. So secret power against citizens marches on. These activists were the test bed. I guess the moral of the story is, free speech is an ideal. You better not be trying to wake anybody up.

201131,1,1604865229,1 star because I can't give lower. Biggest load of propaganda and lies since I watched Gasland and Gasland 2. Totally unsupported accusations and lies loosely based on fact. The fact that Ward Churchill is one of the ones lying about all the bad things the government committed during this era pretty much tells you that it is blatant radical leftist bull. I know the government has done bad things and one of them was COINTELPRO. I watched this film hoping for an honest assessment of that happened.

Although a short doc, it shed light on so much history that I did not know. COINTELPRO is alive and well today. There is a reason that I, and many of my peers, do not know our own history and the history of this nation built on (fundamentally racist and oppressive) laws. What I found most interesting, this due in part to my own ignorance, is that COINTELPRO attacked many different groups of people...not just Black America. Although admittedly, Black America seems to have been, and still is today, the prime target. Overall, this is a great piece of work and it definitely leaves one interested to learn more about this so called ""land of the free"". Thank you!",1419379200,5,795,4.685714285714286

201134,5,1604865229,"If you are wondering why the majority of the ratings are either 5 star or 1 star, the reason is simple. I say this as one who would have given it one star myself until I spent thousands of hours researching historical/political events and who benefited from the outcomes. Those who gave it 1 star are sound bite mainstream revisionist history educated, and don't do their own research. They listen to main stream media(FOX mostly these days), are public educated to a large degree, and right wing(all of which I was one for most of my adult life). Don't get me wrong, both parties are nothing more than the WWF on steroids. It is Coke vs Pepsi. Just phony choices set up to mimic a democratic process. We live in the Matirx for all practical purposes. Fortunately many are waking up and taking the red pill. It may be too late but you need to arm yourself with the truth for the benefit of yourselves and your families. This is of course, as those who study historical/political underpinnings know, just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the governmental/oligarchical control that has been incrementally destroying this republic(no this isn't a democracy lemmings). But don't take the word of one film or any information or 'news' report. Do your own research afterward on the points raised. Educate yourselves people. Turn off the damn football games and Dancing with the Stars and find out about the plans your 'owners' have for you. You won't be pleasantly surprised...",1417219200,31,1473,4.7578125

When these same assets were used to target the Tea Party, Pro-Life or Christian Churches no-one cried foul from any of the groups in this docudrama.

Saboteurs, bombers, and violent revolutionaries are always 'activists'.  Interviews are an airing of personal grievances.  Even if you are highly interested in some or all these movements, you don't get a very good introduction to those parts of history.

I found this documentary to be very informative, and it is with hope that we learn from the past and view these issues with a different solution in mind. I do not believe the greater lesson here has anything to do with race relations as much as it does fundamental human rights and those appointed to protect them. It is sad that there are those who would instill fear at the very idea that the masses should ever want better for themselves and each other. Wasn't Jesus after all a revolutionary?

If you are going to build an argument using interviews/narration, then the interviewee(s) should either be unbiased third party authority figures, or their main points should directly reference some form of official documentation (be it newspaper article, government documents, etc).

I was really hoping for a more complete picture of what COINTELPRO was and why it existed, which wouldn't have been terribly hard to do considering how much documentation has been produced on the topic.
