1222569,4,B00000ILBN,"Although you may hear some complaints over some of Wesley Snipe's recent movies, this one made in 1994 is fairly good. This is partly do to a decent story, cast, and camera work. The directing keeps it tight and focused. The music doesn't date the film badly as I have often seen as a movie hits around ten to twenty years. Fans of skydiving should especially appreciate the numerous jump scenes, including the annual show in Washington D.C. to boot. The story focuses around a skydiving team hijacking a 747 at 38,000 feet to grab a computer hacker being escorted by US Marshals. Later they are tracked and pursued by Snipe's as they try to pull off a heist of data from the DEA computers by doing a jump onto the building. Recommended for family members over twelve for the most part. I am not sure why this has an R rating. There are a couple scenes where people are killed graphically. Good quality DVD with above average replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch ""US Marshals"", ""Passenger 57"", and ""Art of War"".",1207872000,,1026,4.551351351351351
1222570,5,B00000ILBN,"Nope! you sure couldn't get me up there.

Love to watch other people with nerve enough to go up.
U.S. Marshal Pete Nessip is in trouble. He has lost his prisoner. [a twit!] How it was done is a bit of a mystery.

Another mystery is who is the best at sky-diving and where is he? Oh I love this - he has to track down the cadre of techno terrorists.
How and why was this heist planned?

Well second best at sky-diving turns out to be female with a record.  She decides to bargain with Pete.  She wants to take her team out of her parole officers zone.

The action starts heating up from there.  I especially liked the ability to drop onto a specified area.  Darn good characters to do it.

The kidnapped [twit] computer expert spent most of his time squeeling in the air.  Even I wanted to bump him off.

DROP ZONE fulfilled the expectations of entertainment - can't fault it there.  Was never hyped up as a classic. Just good entertainment.

Definitely Recommend - for action - color - gorgeous sky work - decent characters [whatever] - another personal choice movie.",1190332800,,1067,4.38265306122449
1222571,4,B00000ILBN,I really like wesley snipes. I like action movies. I think he a great actor,1168300800,,75,4.066666666666666
1222572,3,B00000ILBN,"Let's face it, this was a fun movie and I liked it.  I enjoy most flicks with Wesley Snipes in 'em.  And, although a novice, I love skydiving.  That was the fun part.  From Yancy dumping Snipes from the Porter sans parachute to their makeshift tandem nighttime landing on a rooftop, it was ridiculously fun in a silly way.  Imagine becoming skilled enough to jump in a major big-way in what, two weeks' time?  Great.  And the absurdity of the skydivers being anything but friendly and open to a ""whuffo"" (a ground-grabbing outsider) made for a top-order, unimagineable fight scene.  Great stuff.  I just hope that when my main canopy snivels and I can't break away, I make out as well as their jumping buddy... i.e., live through the experience.  Blue Skies and Fair Winds!  Watch the movie, then jump from a perfectly good airplane from 2 & 1/2 miles up.",1078790400,2,855,4.596026490066225
1222573,5,B00000ILBN,"I loved this movie. The skydiving stunts are great, and it actually has a plot! Seems most action movies don't even bother with a plot anymore. Wesley Snipes and Yancy Butler did a great job. Their characters are believable, you feel like you're right there. I can't wait to try skydiving myself.",1032652800,9,296,4.711538461538462
1222574,1,B00000ILBN,"The consistent recommendation that this is the ""greatest skydiving movie ever"" hardly pulls DROP ZONE from its plotless, actorless nosedive.  After all, how many skydiving movies have there been?  Even taking into account the sporadically engaging drop sequences, this film is hardly worth renting, much less owning.
The movie's single biggest flaw is its script, which is plagued by a wafer-thin plot.  Worse, it never manages to give its audience the sparest reason to care for any of the characters.  Nor are its flat lines delivered with any real enthusiasm.  Wesley Snipes is so entirely sleepwalking through this production that he gives up even trying to LOOK like the star of the picture by the end, where he's too-often seen in a ridiculous motorcycle helmet more appropriate to an episode of FAT ALBERT than to a major motion picture.  Gary Busey is particularly laughable as the heavy.  Granted, he's given some of the very worst lines in the script, but even his body language conveys no sense of menace.
There's not even a real romantic subplot to distract the audience from the inadequacies of the main plot.  Rather, Snipes and Yancy Butler dance around the edges of emotional involvement but never really take it anywhere.  Given Butler's as-yet-undiscovered acting talent, that's somewhat of a double tragedy.

1222575,5,B00000ILBN,"Wesley Snipes is after the bad guys that use high-tech computer equipment to expose undercover DEA agents in the USA ... naturally the drug kingpins will pay a fortune if they can deliver ... Can Snipes stop them, avenge his brother's death and learn to skydive? hmmm .... it's anybody's guess ... no not really ... engaging but predictable ...
Gary Busey is the on-the-edge-lunatic-bad-guy (ummm, ""Surviving the Game"", ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Under Siege"", et al) so no surprises here ... Yancy Butler (""Hard Target"") is always likable ... Claire Stansfield is a bonus and I was pleasantly surprised to find her in a ""Frasier"" episode ... she turns in a decent performance as a bad girl here ... and who would have thought we'd find Michael Jeter in with the bad guys? Well, he's reluctant but quite indifferent to the DEA agents he exposes ...
Of course, lots of jumps and skydiving scenes blended in ... director is John Badham from ""War Games"".  Andy Romano has been in a lot of action flicks recently ... you'll recognize him as the Admiral from ""Under Siege"" ...",974160000,,1062,4.7405405405405405
1222576,4,B00000ILBN,"it is not snipes best movie...but one of the best movies about skyjumping.  this movie brings you the feeling of jumping out of a plane staight to your  tv. the action sequenzes are very realistic and the story is full of  suspense. if you are interested in skydiving, watch this movie one thumb up",966470400,,298,4.481481481481482
1222577,4,B00000ILBN,as actions go this one is pretty good. the action is fast paced and the movie does not hang in any area. the aerial filmwork is excellent and addictive. if you were considering skydiving this movie might make you do  it. the music is fair but does suit the movie well. if you enjoy snipes  movies then you will probobly enjoy this one.,950054400,2,335,4.301587301587301

1222580,4,B00000ILBN,"This movie is one of those gems that most people have never heard of - the concept sounds wild (parachuting criminals) - and gets even wilder when you try to think of Wesley Snipes sailing thro' the air (especially if you watched the movie BEFORE the ""Blade"" vampire movies...)",1368057600,,277,4.673469387755102
1222581,3,B00000ILBN,"This review is for the video version of Drop Zone. I taped this from cable in the late 1990s and while I liked the premise of the movie it fell slightly short for me. I rate it as average for the reasons below.

I liked Wesley Snipe's performance, but the overall plot of the movie seemed to leave me wanting for more. Why did Gary Busey's character want to sell out DEA agents? He'd retired with honors, so it couldn't be because he was disgruntled. Also, 2 million per month is not much money when one has to split it up with four other people (I'm Not Including The Computer Geek Who'd Have Been Killed Once His Usefulness Was Over). His yearly take would only be $4,800,000. That sounds like alot, but is really chump change when one looks at the profits the drug king pins really make. Perhaps he was cutting them a deal, but in reality he could have charged more than twice as much, which could have come to say 50 million bucks.

Also, did Kala die after she was smashed into the photocopy machine? What are the chances Busey would have fallen into the truck driven by the big bearded fat guy? These contrivances, along with the lack of genuine romance between Snipes and his female co-star (perhaps Hollywood Conservatives Balked At Interracial Romance?) led me to give this movie a Three-Star review. That's too bad, because the movie could and should have been Four-Stars at least.

1222583,5,B00000ILBN,"Bought a used DVD of this movie, but it looks and plays like new! I love the idea of skydiving and hope to try it someday, but there's so few movies about it. This one is so adrenaline pumped, it makes you want to go skydiving right after watching it! What a rush it must be!!! :)",1316476800,,280,3.9298245614035086
1222584,4,B00000ILBN,"Drop Zone is a good movie but almost or actually implausible(yes it's just a movie),Mainly a Sky-Diving movie the year it came out,one to two other similar movies came out(terminal velocity which I saw in the theater being one.)
the movie is long but the action is good and My favorite scene is the jump from the Southeast Financial Center building(called at the time or known as First Union Building then another name now Wachovia.) which was the tallest building at the time in the southeast and in Miami before the hideous Skyscrapers dotted the skyline and blocked the sun in downtown. that's one of the highlights for me in the movie.",1278979200,2,639,4.714285714285714

Now Leedy and Terry are sucked out of the plane when Pete discharges his weapon and a hole in the plane is made. Nesbitt is blamed for the whole thing and is suspended. Now Terry's dead and Leedy, whose body hasn't been found is believed to be. But what they don't know is that Leedy is now with some people who want to use his computer skills. Pete doesn't believe that Leedy is dead and that the whole thing was to spring Leedy. So he turns to Jess Crossman, a skydiver, for help on who may have done this whole thing. ""Drop Zone"" is an action ride from start to finish starring Wesley Snipes as a detective hunting down the men who killed his brother.

1222586,5,B00000ILBN,"I just recently watched this film and I nearly dropped dead, from how awesome this movie is.  Every actor/actress in this film is completely in the zone the entire time.  Not one of them drops a line or zones out for even a millisecond. My friend dropped this movie off the other night and I was getting a little bored of playing Zone of the Enders so I decided to drop the disc into my DVD player.  As the laser zoned in onto the disc, action packed poetry in motion erupted onto my HD television (which has a general viewing zone of 31.5"").  The first skydiving scene absolutely blew me away. So much so that I accidentally dropped my Pizza Hut PaZone on my lap.

The pacing of this film is impeccable and never drops a beat.  The only thing really lacking in the pacing was heart pounding tunes dropping every couple of minutes, such as Kenny Loggins, Highway to the Danger Zone. I don't want to drop too many hints and spoil the thrilling ending to this film but it is definitely one to remember.  The first thing I did after finishing the film was look it up on IMDB to see how many awards it won.  Needless to say, my jaw dropped when I saw that this film had won nothing.  I said to myself, ""what am I in the the Twilight Zone or something?""

My ""no spin zone"" final review of this film is A+.  The DVD version looks drop dead gorgeous on an HDTV.  I also highly recommend ordering this movie on Amazon. They will drop ship it speedily to your front door within a day!(depending on when you place your order and what time zone you are in)",1233273600,3,1545,4.235494880546075
