It seems a lot like the original ""gone in 60 seconds"" the real low budget boring one from the 70's. This thing is just too lame and boring.",1526515200,,388,4.328767123287672
8250073,5,B0013D8L90,"A friend recommended Crash & Burn to me. As a frequent flier and concerned citizen, this book was eye opening. I couldn't put this book down. In fact, I am sending a copy to all of my friends who travel for business regularly.

8250075,4,B0013D8L90,"i really enjoyed this movie. it is about a high tech car thief who is recruited by the FBI to bust a car theft ring. Kind of like gone in ""sixty seconds"" meets ""bulletproof"". it is a movie that will appeal to younger people. it keeps a high pace of action, with out a lot of mushy stuff. there is the classic hot girl who he has to save, but she doesn't really speak at all in the movie.

the gangsters are classic bad guys, with scars and scary voices. i found the main character to be very likable, i am not familiar with him, but he totally sends out a good guy vibe. i definitely recommend this movie if your bored, and want to see some some mild violence and sweet rides. it was a spike TV movie.",1323648000,,701,4.043165467625899
8250076,4,B0013D8L90,This was actually a good movie. It's about a guy who carjacks get caught by the FBI is train for 2 years to bring sown carjacking smuggler. Had a little action and it was decent to watch. It's no A lister movie but I still enjoyed watching the movie.,1300492800,,250,4.122448979591836
8250077,3,B0013D8L90,"3 of 5 stars for this action movie. If you take the movie Gone in 60 Seconds and combine it with The Fast and The Furious you get this movie. The basic plot has an undercover FBI agent (Erik Palladino) inside of a car jacking ring trying to find out who is Mr. Big. The car jacking ring has a rival gang trying to take over the business. Lots of car chase and driving scenes, but, frankly not too well photographed. So, alot of the exciting action driving gets lost.

Overall, the characters were thin and not at all interesting. Even when the agents cover is blown and they kidnap his wife, it doesn't get much more interesting. There are a couple of unnecessarily volent scenes that lasted much longer than necessary.

This is an average car movie. Better choices are any of the Fast/Furious movies or either version of Gone in 60 seconds.",1253923200,4,841,4.454545454545454
8250078,5,B0013D8L90,"Erik Palladino (""OVER*THERE"") is Kevin Hawkins, a car thief who is recruited by the FBI to help them take down an international car-theft ring, using his connections from the inside.  To do this, he has to return to his past, where he reconnects with old friends, including the girlfriend that he walked out on two years before.

A fast-paced, action-packed movie, with a love story on the side, and Erik Palladino playing the lead - I loved it!

This was a ""Spike"" TV movie, and there are some violent scenes that were meant for mature audiences.  Unfortunately, there are no extras on the DVD.",1212624000,3,595,4.6923076923076925
