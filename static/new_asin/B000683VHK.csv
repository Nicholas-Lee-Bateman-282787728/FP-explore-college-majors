2174985,5,B000683VHK,"there is just something about a cop who does bad things that just seems so true. at least this dude ain't trying to hide the fact that he is scandelous. this movie surprised me. at first i thought it was just gonna be another cheesy action flick, but once the storyline started to pick up, you really feel as if it was happening. from the time where tom jane shot that man who was running at him and all the way through, it was just a great set of action sequences placed together. it is definately worth a look for anyone who likes to see the robber's side of the story.",1105142400,3,571,4.153153153153153
2174986,2,B000683VHK,"Tom Jane, who recently starred in the dissappointing, ""The Punisher"" dissappoints yet again ""Stander.""

Here he stars in the real life account of Andres Stander, a White Apartheid-era South African cop who later became his country's most notorious bank robber.

To his credit, Jane gives a solid perfomance. But he's failed by a weak script which never fleshes his character out.  As a result, Stander remains enigma not only to his family, friends, and partners in crime but also to the viewer.

The movie never really lets us see what makes Stander tick and what drives him to bank robbery.  We are led to believe that it stems from his role in the police suppression of a Black South African protest march against the country's education policies.  When White South African cops respond with lethal violence, Stander shoots an unarmed Black man.

The movie suggests that this action plunges him into a deep emotional and spiritual crisis that finds him questioning the very system he's been laboring in service to.

I can't buy that because Stander is shown to be a high ranking, motivated officer who is well-liked by his peers and superiors.  He is even referred to at one point as ""the youngest captain in the history of the force.""

Are we to believe that Stander achieved this level of success in this system in some sort of blissful ignorance that his government was corrupt, racist, and violent?  Can we accept that a law enforcement officer of this rank and prominence in South Africa at that time had not only never before engaged in unnecessary force against Blacks but was also clueless about what his fellow cops really got up to whenever they stormed the Black townships?

The movie also doesn't do a good job of explaining whether or not Stander saw crime as a means of atoning in some way for past actions or if he just decided buy into another form of corruption purely for personal gain.

This is because Stander, as shown here, certainly wasn't a Robin Hood figure who stole money only to give it to poor, South African Blacks.

The film depicts only one instance where Stander gives stolen money to a Black person, in this case a pan-handling child.  The action seems to be motivated more by a desire to not be caught with evidence than by any sense of altruism.

Director Bronwen Hughes seems unable to decide if this film should be a commentary on the policies of Apartheid-era South Africa or just a ripping crime yarn.  ""Stander"" ultimately emerges as neither.

A dissappointment.",1104710400,2,2506,4.761574074074074
2174987,4,B000683VHK,"Stander is a great movie, and Jane proves he is a great actor. I don't know much about the history of the movie or how accurate its telling was to the true story, but it keeps your interest from the beginning. I recommend the movie to anyone who likes crime movies or action.

The beginning of the movie shows how he becomes disillusioned with the system of apartheid.  But, he becomes a bank robber to enrich himself and his gang, not to make some grand statement against apartheid. The story is neither compelling nor admirable.  At the end of the movie there is a statement that Nelson Mandela was freed and became president of South Africa, as if Stander had some influence on that.

If you saw Punisher then he does better here. This story follows the Andre Stander real story pretty much to a tee, As some critics say you seen one bank robbery you seen them alland mabe they hung a little much on that, but still leaves enough story for this to be watched more than once which I would give it high ratings for. Well done, good acting all around and entertaining to watch..",1103846400,,534,4.194174757281553
2174990,5,B000683VHK,"So speaks Andre Stander the day after a massive riot in Johannesburg South Africa in which Stander as a police captain finds himself killing a Zulu man in a morally shattering encounter.  This utter disillusionment with the police force and their responses to the Apartheid situation makes Stander withdraw emotionally and physically from the Riot Squad and eventually his challenge that the blacks are unduly mistreated leads him to break the white laws by initiating a string of bank robberies - not for money but for a bizarre sort of revenge.

Stander (Tom Jane) is good at what he does, both as a cop and as a criminal, but his clever bank heists eventually result in his being jailed where he finds two partners (David O'Hara and Dexter Fletcher) to join him in escape and in one of the longest bank robbery sprees in the history of South Africa.  Stander remains conflicted: he loves his new wife Bekkie (Deborah Kara Unger), he knows what he is doing is wrong, but the money is often shared with the blacks of Johannesburg, and he is driven to leave South Africa to eventually locate in Lauderdale, Florida.  The eventual results of this man's career bring this film to a close in an action packed yet very soulful way.

The film, as written by Bima Stagg and directed by Bronwen Hughes, captures the atmosphere of the era in South Africa, and gives us a realistic look at the plight of the Africans in the Apartheid, offering insights to both sides of the conflict like few others have in film.  He coaxes fine performances from his large cast of actors and extras, making this film less an action thriller than a character study of the enigmatic Andre Stander.

The true star of this film, a film that deserves far more attention than it has been given, is Tom Jane.  Jane is a strong actor, able to take on language accents with the best of them,  and able to make us understand the spectrum of personality in this fascinating character.  There are many scenes in which he plays in full nudity, quite apropos to the story, but just an indication of his commitment to 'fleshing out' of his role.  He is an actor to watch, an actor unafraid of tough roles in contrast to the showy Hollywood star parts. Grady Harp, December 2004",1103846400,20,2237,4.609571788413098
2174991,5,B000683VHK,"Well I live in Montreal, and I had to wait 4 months for this film to get to my one and local theatre. This movie is the true story based on the legend of Andre Stander (Thomas Jane) and his memembers of the Stander bank robbing gang. Andre is a normal man like you and I living the life as a cop. But times are getting harder and harder for Andre with all the warefforts he must complete in Africa. He then realizes why arrest the bad guys while you can be one, and goes on a rampage of bank roberys with great skill. This film was made for a certain audience and they will enjoy it. The acting by Thomas Jane is briliant and I personaly think he should be nominated for something in this film. Well now all I jsut wanna know is were can I find that crazy theme song they have for the movie...its like the theme from the first Driver video game its great anyways ur going to love this movie.

2174993,5,B000683VHK,"This film was only shown about half a dozen times in obscure places over the country, but from what I've heard it looks to be the underground hit of the year. It's amazing how little buzz was recieved, but it's finally coming to DVD in December, just as King Arthur comes out too.

The movie is about a guy named John Stander, played by the underrated Thomas Jane who seems to have the worst luck in getting decent acting roles. He is a South African cop, who is fed up with the brutality of police towards a revolution. So therefore, he decides to go into crime, and becomes one of the most successful bank robbers in history. As quirky a plot as this may seem, it's supposedly all a true story.

I don't know any technical details yet about the DVD itself, but it's only a couple of months away. Anyway, check this out. It's promising to be a big underground sucess.",1097971200,4,868,4.351851851851852

2175024,1,B000683VHK,"Movies based on real events/people usually take fictional liberties, but this one takes the cake.  Stander was a former S. African police captain turned prolific bank robber who even managed a prison escape, but that is about the extent of the truth in the film. The whole movie plot fictionalizes Stander into a self-loathing white guy consumed with white guilt after shooting a black youth during a 1970's apartheid uprising, so he turns on the establishment by robbing banks - thus, an anti-apartheid hero and fabricated storyline is created. The real Stander did tell similar embellished tales to explain his life of crime after being caught and convicted, but he was not even present at the riot and he never shot a black youth, or dozens of protesters during his police service as he sometimes claimed.  The ""white guilt"" theme goes to such LOL absurd extremes, that the Stander character bravely goes into a crowed black bar to to confess to the father of the youth he ""shot"", and proceeds to allow the father to severely beat him, further heroizing the character.  The real Stander was a cold calculating psychopath who abandoned his own child; had he really killed someone during his police or criminal career, he would have felt no guilt whatsoever.
The real story of Stander and his gang is far more fascinating and better than the contrived politically correct nonsense in the film.  This movie was actually a bit ahead of its time, as the social engineering agenda in Hollywood and the entertainment industry has now reached unwatchable levels of absurdity.",1481155200,,1570,4.9356060606060606

2175080,4,B000683VHK,"Released in 2003, Stander is based on the true story of Andre Stander, a police captain in South Africa turned bank robber in the late 70s/early 80s, dubbed a modern-day Robin Hood by the media. Thomas Jane stars in the title role while Dexter Fletcher and David O'Hara play his partners. Deborah Kara Unger is on hand as his wife while Melanie Merle plays the girlfriend of one of the gang members. Marius Weyers also appears as Standers father.

While this is based on a true story, people dispute parts of it, like the idea that Stander occasionally gave some of the loot to impoverished black people and the idea that his disillusionment and fall into crime stemmed from an incident where he and other officers shot and killed over twenty unarmed black residents of Thembisa during the 1976 Soweto uprising. Nevertheless, the gist of the story is true and the depiction of apartheid-era South Africa is interesting. Moreover, the news media did indeed portray Stander as a modern-day Robin Hood and so the movie reflects this element and I wouldnt be surprised if he really did give some cash to blacks on a few occasions.

The score by The Free Association (aka David Holmes) is odd, but I suppose the filmmakers wanted something that would mesh with the time period and location. While this is a crime thriller, its generally realistic and lacks the eye-rolling action sequences of conventional Hollywood thrillers. Theres action, of course, but its believable and mixed with the drama of the real-life players and events.

The movie runs 116 minutes and was shot in South Africa.

2175081,5,B000683VHK,"Andre Stander was a happily married Captain in the South African Police during the dark days of apartheid. He worked at a time when it was compulsory to do `riot duty' in the township ghettoes, this is covered in the film. Then he decided one day to rob a bank and by all accounts he ruddy well loved it. He went on a massive crime spree - but it was not too long before his erstwhile colleagues caught him - but the adventure was not about to end because of a pesky prison sentence - this purports to tell his story.

Now I say purports because there has been a bit of licence taken with his actual story, which was obviously a deliberate choice of the film makers, but if this whets your appetite then do check him out further. Portrayed as a frustrated Robin Hood sometimes, and a clear career criminal at others he appears to have been someone that was hard to define in any neat way.

The film though is really well made with great period detail and some fine performances and indeed accents - Thomas Jane as Stander shows what an impressive actor he can be and why he should get better gigs. Ably supported by Dexter Fletcher and Deborah Kara Unger as Stander's wife Bekkie; this is for those who like a bit of a thriller and a bit of realism thrown into the mix - one I missed first time round and am glad I finally got to see it.",1433030400,2,1337,4.21875

It doesn't completely hold together (hence the star rating), but there's a nicely retro, '70's feel to all of this. It's all refreshingly grown-up, and is a good showcase for Thomas Jane - an actor who, sadly, hasn't achieved the visibility or status that he could have.",1361318400,,424,4.821917808219178
2175086,3,B000683VHK,"Tom Jane plays Andre Stander, a police captain in South Africa during Apartheid. He's becoming more and more disheartened by the way blacks are treated, and he's put over the edge after killing a black man during an escalating political demonstration. He begins easing his guilt and protesting the current political situation by robbing banks. He's caught, imprisoned, escapes and starts all over again. This time, though, he has the help of two guys he helped break out of prison.

This IS a good movie. It's very watchable. The writer/producers did a fine job capturing the time and place. Jane does a great job as Stander. His look and accent are right on the dollar. The supporting cast is good and I liked a lot of the soundtrack. Where this falls short is in the story itself. Stander's whole adventure began with his being disillusioned by the political climate in South Africa, but that is dealt with only lightly. Much of the film involves the many robberies, all done in various disguises, and the team's subsequent rise as media anti-heroes. They also do a decent job of portraying Stander's longing to re-establish the relationship with his wife, but again, it plays second fiddle to the robberies. As in other ""rise of a gangster"" movies, you see the successes and the perps' rise in life-style but this is run-of-the-mill. It carries no emotional weight.

This is a good watch. If you like Tom Jane you'll probably like this movie. Just don't expect it to deliver quite the gravity it should.",1316649600,,1506,4.8108108108108105

2175091,4,B000683VHK,"Stander was a very good film about the real-life exploits of Andre Stander, Lee McCall and Allan Heyl who were known collectively as The Stander Gang. The Stander Gang was well-known for their daring and reckless bank robberies in their homeland of South Africa. The film stars Tom Jane (The Punisher, Deep Blue Sea) as the title character with Dexter Fletcher (Band of Brothers and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and David Patrick O'Hara (Braveheart) rounding out the rest of the Stander Gang.

The film starts off introducing Andre Stander as a highly decorated member of the South African Police Force in the late 1970's and the beginning of the anti-apartheid movement. It shows Andre Stander's growing disgust and disenchantment in his government's racist apartheid policies and his own role in enforcing it. After a violent and brutal break-up of an anti-apartheid protest gathering where Stander kills a protestor, the film begins to move into meat of the story. Stander's disenchantment with the government causes him to commit bank robberis in audacious fashion as a way to rebel and defy the very state he has sworn to protect and serve.

The scenes where Stander commits these bank robberies were shot well and showed just how daring Andre Stander really was in his exploits. There's even a sequence where he returns to the scene of his most recent crime to investigate the robbery. A robbery he just committed just hours before during his lunchtime. These scenes and the later ones when he's joined by two other bank robbers shows Tom Jane at his finest. I think many would be hard-pressed not to think Jane's performance as a South African, accent and all, wasn't authentic. His charisma ruled throughout the film and was mostly evident through the many bank robbing sequences. He truly gave Andre Stander the air of a Robin Hood character who, despite his criminal acts, became a sort of folk antihero.

The second half of the film details the exploits of Stander after his incarceration for his bank robberies while a captain of the South African Police Force. It's here that we meet the rest of Stander's Gang as he recruits fellow inmate and outlaws Lee McCall and Allan Heyl. Even the way Stander engineers his escape from the work-prison he has been sent to shows his daring in thumbing his nose at the state and the police he used to be a part of. Dexter Fletcher was very good as the twitchy and less stable Lee McCall whose nerves begin to fray the bolder and bolder the gangs bank robberies become. David Patrick O'Hara was also good as the very professional bank robber Allan Heyl. Heyl didn't have the charisma that Stander had, but he was the rock which kept the robberies from spiraling out of their control. It was great to see O'Hara in another strong role. Some might recognize him as the scene-stealing Stephen, the Irish rebel who joins William Wallace's fight against the English during Mel Gibson's Braveheart.

The rest of the film was pretty much one bank robbery after the other with the Stander Gang always one step ahead of the police task force put together to capture them. In a twist of fate, the task force was headed by Stander's former friend in the police force Cor Van Deverter whose intimate knowledge of Stander's tactics and thought-processes helps in slowly closing the noose around the gang. There's abit of a repitition in the robberies and the getaways, but they serve an important purpose of slowly building up the Stander Gang's folkhero status amongst the population. It also showed the effect it had on some of the members of the gang. As popular and infamous the gang had become they were still outlaws who knew that sooner or later their luck would run out and they'd either be put back into prison or killed outright. For some it was the latter and for others the former.

Throughout the film, one could sense that some of the motivations behind Andre Stander's actions as a bank robber was to assuage his guilt over the sanctioned acts of brutality he had to perform to protect the apartheid government of his nation. The film and the story being told was almost a full-lenght film of Stander's attempt to make up for his past transgressions. And what better way to do this than use the system of the state against itself. He himself points out that a white man could get away with anything when most of the policemen in the city were called away to deal with an emergency regarding the black majority population. Stander realizes this to be true and his second career as a bank robber was born. The film only hints at him being a very good policeman, but the majority of the film shows just how much better he was as a criminal.

The film was expertly directed by Bronwen Hughes and as said earlier had strong performances from all the main leads in the film. The story rarely slowed down to the point that the story lost its direction. Every scene always led to the next part of the story being told until the very bitter end. Stander was a very good film anchored by a fine performance from Tom Jane. The film showed a brief glimpse into South Africa's apartheid past and how one individual's decision to defy the state led to a brief, but daring life of a modern-day Robin Hood.",1154822400,3,5250,4.694896851248643
2175092,3,B000683VHK,"STANDER is another political message flick (yes, another!), the message being how oppressive and brutal was the Apartheid era. No, that is not the entire story. STANDER is also a superb action and adventure tale of a white cop who goes bad and starts robbing banks. The writer of STANDER would have us believe that Stander's turn to crime is due to guilt for his actions against a black man during a riot. That may be true but it also just may be true that Andre Stander, played wonderfully by Tom Jane, was just a crook and a rotten cop. Leave it to Hollywood to tell us again and again how evil whites are. Of course, some years after Apartheid came Rwanda where black Hutus slaughtered a million black Tutus in one year, maybe a 1000 times the lynchings in the US in one hundred years. Yet, in this movie, Stander is so burdered by guilt for his ""misdeed"" that he starts robbing banks. In light of Rwanda, this seems grotesquely silly but strangely redeeming. How many Hutus felt guilty for hacking their brothers to death, man, woman and child, with machetes purchased from China so that they didn't have to waste bullets? I recommend STANDER for the action, the photography and for the compelling ""true"" story. It is a decent film about a brazen, tough cop who went bad. But it is always useful to keep history in perspective when watching subtle propagranda woven into an adventure tale.",1143244800,3,1393,4.598393574297189
2175093,2,B000683VHK,"After reading some glowing reviews of this movie, I made a point of seeing it. Was I disappointed!

Pompous, preachy, self-important, and--worst of all--really dull.

Despite being ""based on a true story"", it's a plot you've seen many times before, especially in Australian movies. (Think ""Ned Kelly"".) Especially when people start cheering Stander as a folk hero (for robbing banks?), I got a real sense of deja vu.

Don't waste your time, even if you're a big Thomas Jane fan--I am, and I still hated this movie.",1133049600,6,514,4.885057471264368
2175094,4,B000683VHK,"Based on a true story of a South African cop who has a change of heart after a bungled riot control operation, this film goes against many of the stereotypes of films based on ""reality"" but which are, in fact, highly fictionalized versions of the truth, with a bit of truth thrown in.

The story of Stander, former cop turned bank robber, stands apart because it is believable and generally compelling. You can't help but watch to find out how his story ends, what will happen and WHY he does what he does. The film doesn't reveal all but that is fine. Perhaps there weren't any absolute answers as to WHY Stander did what he did. Perhaps his behavior mystified him as much as anyone (the film hints at that).

I can see why this one didn't reach more people, as the accents can make it hard to understand some of the dialogue. There are also some slower parts that are necessary for understanding Stander but which viewers might find wearisome (I did not).

This is far above most of the ""highly acclaimed"" movies you'll find at the theatre or your local DVD/video/game store. It is well worth seeking out, especially if you like something with plenty of action and suspense but which is also a bit different.",1129334400,2,1210,4.541284403669724

Set in the smiley face days of the 70s, STANDER works due to the remarkable performance by Thomas Jane, who has been critically lambasted for some of his work in ""The Punisher"" and ""Dreamcatcher.""  In this film, Jane captures the frustration, guilt, and determination of Andre Stander.  This antihero actually wins his audience's sympathy as he struggles to elude the law and expunge his own guilt over the murder of an African rebel.  STANDER is a different film and even with its tragic conclusion, stays in your mind.",1120262400,,753,4.639097744360902
2175096,5,B000683VHK,"Stander was one of the least watched and most amazing films of the year.  Tom Jane gives a startling, heart ripping, pulse pounding portrayal of outlaw Andre Stander.  Stander was the notorious Johannesburg police officer shocked and revolted by what he witnessed as an officer in apartheid driven South Africa.  To prove what's wrong Stander embarks on a career of crime - bank robberies to be specific, and he finds he's good at it.  Very good indeed.

Though we know what he's doing is inherently wrong, one cannot not route for Stander as he and his gang become more and more daring and flamboyant with their bank heists.

The supporting cast is up to the challenge and Deborah Kara Unger gives a standout performance as Stander's much put-upon wife whom he never stops loving.

Rare is the film that combines such strong social and political commentary with rip-roaring action adventure.  This is a truly remarkable effort from director Bronwyn Hughes who'd previously given us fluff like ""Harriet the Spy"" and the Ben Affleck challenged ""Forces of Nature.""  If she makes more films like ""Stander"" - she could be collecting gold statuettes.",1116547200,3,1145,4.952879581151833

But this is no Punisher.  It is an excellent and well told story, filled with raw emotions and solid pacing.

2175100,1,B000683VHK,"Based on a true story, the 2003 film sounded interesting.  It's set in South Africa and starts in the 1970s when the evils of Apartheid were apparent.  At that time Andre Stander was a young newly-married police officer.  During an uprising, he shot and killed an unarmed protester.  This disturbed him so much that he turned to bank robbing.  Eventually he went to prison for this.  In prison, he met up with a couple of fellow inmates.  They escaped and went on a bank robbing spree.  The ending is inevitable.

How the criminal bank robbing activity was a protest against Apartheid is rather fuzzy.  But I watched the film anyway, always waiting for something to grab my sympathy.  The film is almost two hours long and I was soon bored.  Now I think I should have turned it off early, rather than waiting for the end.  But I saw every single scene.
