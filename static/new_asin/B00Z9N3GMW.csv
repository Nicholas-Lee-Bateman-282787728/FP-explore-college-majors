8719650,3,B00Z9N3GMW,"Gabbar is Back is a little confusing at times, but overall a fairly decent vengeance/cleaning up the streets genre film.  Like your Bollywood norm, you've got a few choreographed dance music clips in the middle.  The movie starts off with an Indian anti smoking commercial too.  Basically Gabbar is some sort of lecturer, at National University, a place police and criminals are forbidden to enter.  Gabbar shows his students the importance of physics in their lives by beating up some thugs who came on campus telling everyone the university is closed, classes over or something like that. Gabbar is wanted by the police for kidnapping 10 collectors (took me a little while to realise these aren't guys who collect paintings or action figures, but are corrupt officials who take bribes).  He publicly killed one of them, resulting in every public official terrified to take their usual bribes, with some even giving them back in the hopes of avoiding being Gabbar's next victims.  Gabbar continues to clean up the Indian streets, while being detoured to give a woman giving birth a lift to the hospital, intervene in a car park bingle, get justice for a relative of a hospital charging for tests they are doing on someone they know is dead and other stuff like this.

Mostly you'll need to read English in the subtitles but occasionally, usually for reasons never explained a line or two is spoken in English.  The acting is different to your western norm, but still a lot of fun.",1470268800,,1481,4.826086956521739
8719651,1,B00Z9N3GMW,"A forgettable flop of a film, in spite of its blockbuster status.  Akshay Kumar's latest movies are indicative of his growing long in the tooth (""It's Entertainment"").  This VERY violent movie tries to recapture some of his lost ground.  Not worth your time to see 15 minutes of nonstop violence with a man with freshly broken arms beating his enemies to pulp.",1449014400,,360,4.774193548387097

8719653,5,B00Z9N3GMW,"Nice. IN MANY INSTANCES, it is the student who wins the rights for the populous. Great movie. I loved Akshay's character. I wonder if there are, really, Gabbars out here in the world. Could you imagine if there were? Wow. What a place this would be. Great Movie. See it soon.",1443657600,,275,4.411764705882353
