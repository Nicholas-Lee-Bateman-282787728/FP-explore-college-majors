8346290,4,B001VG2MFS,"If there's a more explicit Peach DVD than this one on the market, I don't know what it is. Features a lot of spread-legged nudity, tight close-ups from behind and a LOT of solo touching. All of that is good, of course, but in the main feature itself that would be worth only three  stars from me. Because it is this so explicit, this lineup also isn't Peach's A list. You've never heard of most of these women, for good reason: lots of flat butts and grossly-shaped breasts. Not too many really pretty girls either.

Additionally, this is one of those tricky compilation programs that Peach did a lot of back in the middle part of the decade but not as much more recently (this is from 2009).

So those are the big  strikes against this one, and I was prepared to give it three stars...until the bonus content.

Three lengthy vignettes with Erin Avery and Nikki Nova. Erin is unappealing to me and unfortunately she gets two vignettes here, but her second one is downright filthy--not for what she does so much as what she says. Uncharted waters for Peach. Let's just say she tells you exactly what she wants to do to you, and there is no suggestiveness or innuendo here: It is direct, as it should be.

Yet even with that addition, I probably still would have rated this one three stars...except for Nikki Nova's bonus vignette. Holy smokes, kids: It's the single most-explicit Peach vignette I've ever seen before, and we get a look at Nikki from every angle, both close up and in context, for nearly nine minutes. Nikki never did much work  with Peach but with this one she jumped right into Penthouse territory.

It's still hard for me to recommend this one because of all of the strikes against it, but  I will say that if you don't watch Nikki's one vignette then you're missing out.",1378252800,3,1789,4.513931888544891
