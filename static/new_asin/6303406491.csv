640252,5,6303406491,"This is one of the best made for tv mini-series.  The movie is based on the dominick dunne novel of the same name.  The story is also based on a true story, the story of alfred bloomingdale and his mistress of 12 years, vicki morgan.
both jason robards and rebecca de mornay do outstanding jobs, but jill eikenberry is not to be forgotten either as the wealthy unforgiving socialite wife.
i highly recommend this movie, its one of my favorites.",1005609600,19,444,4.5375
7846004,4,6303406491,"Terrific made-for-TV flick which shows why a realistic, understated portrait of the sick and empty world of the corrupt rich tends to be far more compelling than the campy junk that, say, ""Dynasty"" quickly became (although both filmed at the Filoli mansion).

Good performances, script and direction allow AN INCONVENIENT WOMAN to offer up a memorable peek into how the 1% lives. And it's not very pretty, no matter how genteel the pretensions of the participants..

This needs to be on DVD, unedited, but it takes eons for the best made-for-TV movies to ever get there.

4 to 5 stars...",1441324800,,587,4.85
