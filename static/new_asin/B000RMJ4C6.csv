8201353,5,B000RMJ4C6,"Been meaning to order Blaze Bayley Alive in Poland for a while but saving to get to his gigs and buy his latest album got in the way. :)
This is a great video of a gig I would have loved to have been at. Blaze's voice, energy, sense of humour and respect for his audience are shown here so well.
Some people have made negative comments about the drummer's performance but it didn't seem to bad to me and having to keep up with the speed of the guitar work on the first couple of numbers would have tested anyone. If anything it was the distant, haughty posing of the Bermudez boys on guitars that got me. But then I'm used to seeing Blaze with the boys from Absolva and they really seem to have fun together.
The tracks are a nice mix of one from Wolfsbane (tough as steel) six from Iron Maiden and eight from Blaze, one of the best has got to be Silicon Messiah from Blaze's first album after leaving Iron Maiden.
A great addition to my Blaze Bayley collection and a great introduction to Blaze Bayley if you have not heard/seen him before.",1453334400,,1041,4.236180904522613

Now on to the review of the DVD:  IT ROCKS!!  I've watched it several times, and enjoy it more each time.  If you are a fan of Blaze (or perhaps unfamiliar with his work and looking for a place to start), or of Iron Maiden (how could anyone NOT be a fan of Iron Maiden??), or just good music, and especially live concerts, you need to own this DVD.  This DVD is ""As Live As It Gets"" (to borrow the title of Blaze's earlier live CD, which frankly is not nearly as good or as ""Live"" as this DVD, due to poor editing).  Blaze is really playing to the crowd here, and his earnestness and sincerity truly shine through.  He and his band are very gracious towards Poland and the Polish metal fans, and you can tell that the people really do appreciate it (as an American it kind of makes me sad to consider just how stifling and drab life is in communist/socialist countries that they react so strongly to just the little hint of freedom that rock n' roll music signifies).  Blaze is constantly interacting with the crowd throughout, often prefacing the songs with interesting expository intros, explaining what the songs are about or telling little stories that segue into the song titles.  The song ""10 Seconds"" starts out with a nice little bass intro/crowd teaser, and during ""Look for the Truth"" Blaze gets down from the stage and goes up to the front row of the audience, shaking hands and high-fiving the crowd, all while simultaneously rendering in letter perfect fashion the intense and melancholy opening lines of the song, a really nice moment that displays his skill, professionalism, and genuine empathy with the audience as well as the sincerity of his music.  Other highlights of this all around great show include an absolutely rockin' version of ""Alive"", a passionate rendition of ""Silicon Messiah"", and a solid delivery of ""Man on the Edge"" extended out with a nice crowd teasing/fist pumping intro.

The extras on the DVD are worthwhile, the centerpiece being the 42 minute interview with Blaze in which he talks about his early days with Wolfsbane, lengthy discourse on his time with Maiden (I found particularly interesting his mention of the fact that when Steve Harris first introduced his ideas for ""Sign of the Cross"" and tried to explain the song to Blaze and the other Maiden members, none of them could even understand what he was talking about), and discussion of his solo albums up to that point.  The band interview, while much shorter, is nevertheless also interesting and informative.

Which brings me to a point I would like to address: with all due respect to the opinions of the other reviewers, Blaze's band here is just not that bad.  I admit that I myself used to think that they were holding Blaze back, and indeed several of them are awfully young (the drummer and one of the guitarists have since been replaced anyway).  Yes they do make some evident mistakes during this show (which as far as I'm concerned just makes it that much more live), and on some of the more difficult Maiden tunes (i.e., ""Virus"", ""Sign of the Cross""), no they don't quite pull it off.  But let's be fair-who are you going to find that CAN duplicate Iron Maiden?  Uh, like, maybe... NOBODY??  Of Course these guys are not going to be able to reproduce Maiden; it is unrealistic to expect them (or anyone else) to do so.  But at least they are willing to try, and on some of the ""simpler"" songs (if there is such a thing as a simple Maiden song) like ""Look for the Truth"" or ""Two Worlds Collide"" they actually do a pretty good job.  At least give them an E for effort (and the Bermudez brothers, particularly David on bass, I think does a really good job here).  Compared to what otherwise passes for ""music"" nowadays, Blaze and his band are all over it, the top of the heap (Blaze actually sings, not just screams, and both of his guitarists actually play LEADs, not just chords and riffs).

With that said, I do admit that the shortened version of ""Sign of the Cross"" is a bit of a disappointment.  Up to the point where they skip the middle part, they had been doing a somewhat uneven, but still passable, version, and the short passage just prior to the bridge (the part they left out in this version) they had done really well, with the Bermudez brothers doing it just like Steve and Davy do on ""Rock in Rio"", standing next to each other watching each others' guitars to get the timing right.  Yes it is unfortunate that they didn't play the whole thing (if Blaze wanted to do an edited version of a Maiden song, he should have played ""The Angel & the Gambler"", now there's a song that needs some paring down), but ok, all it means is that Blaze's band, though good and giving their all, is not Iron Maiden.  But we already knew that, and ""not being Iron Maiden"" isn't a crime.

So don't sweat it, and by all means do not let that one fact dissuade you.  This is an excellent DVD and an absolutely awesome show by a great singer and a lively, energetic band.  Buy it now, you won't have time to regret it, you'll be too busy rockin' and headbangin'.",1270684800,7,5941,4.649425287356322
8201356,3,B000RMJ4C6,"Blaze gives a performance straight from his dark and twisted heart in this DVD. The rest of the band is definitely not show-stopping, but the camera mainly focuses on Blaze and his antics, which sometimes left my brother and I laughing hysterically.
It was cool to see some Maiden songs on here but then again it wasn't Murray, Gers, McBrain and Harris playing them.
I don't pull this DVD out too often, but as I don't have any DVD's of Blaze singing for Maiden, I have to settle for this.",1231113600,,489,4.444444444444445
8201357,5,B000RMJ4C6,"Just saw the concert last nigth. A good friend of mine bring it from Finland and was a really nice surprise see Blaze in top form. He sing better than ever and give a hell of a good show. I will not complain about the musician that play with him, since I can't play at all. I think they are really good anyway.
His lates CD is a killer and at last the colombians brother still there. New drumer and new guitar as well. Can't wait fot the next show. To be filmed at Z7, Switzerland, this will be the first DVD released by the new Blaze Bayley band. The setlist of this full show will be indicative of 'The Tour That Will Not Die' with plenty of new tracks, some favourites as well as previously unreleased brand new material.

Anyway Live in Poland is great and must to have for any heavy metal fans.

8201358,3,B000RMJ4C6,Blaze is excellent...slightly deranged the way we like him. The drummer is truly awful and the Zakk Wylde clone can't play like Zakk Wylde (check out the butchered Silicon Messiah and Man On The Edge). Looking forward to another DVD from Blaze with a better band (which he now has - two of whom are on this DVD and are fine). For definitive Blaze Bayley get The Man Who Would Not Die.,1220659200,,384,4.347222222222222
8201359,2,B000RMJ4C6,"It suffers from the modern trend of editing the bloody thing so fast that you'll suffer a headache. Also, amazing Blaze guitarists Wray and Slater are gone. (although the guitar work in the new album THE MAN WHO WOULD NOT DIE is very good). Buy at your own risk",1217289600,3,261,4.346938775510204
8201360,5,B000RMJ4C6,"I was hesitant to buy this DVD because of the new band. I understand that the new band went through a lot of work to learn songs from Blaze and Maiden era. So with that said, I will be skeptical purchasing Blaze Bayley's new album based on this performance. The drummer is the worst of the bunch here but fortunately he was replaced in time for the new album? The rest of the band is just ok but no match to Blaze's powerful voice which was ON! -saving this live performance. I give 5 stars because of Blaze's outstanding vocals and showmanship -after all- it is called Blaze Bayley!

highlights: Alive, The Brave, Man on the Edge, Futureal, Ten Seconds, Virus, Look for the Truth, Born as a Stranger - all played well and of course Blaze Bayley himself.

lows: the horrible version of the Sign of the Cross although again Blaze was so ON! (I don't like songs being shortened because of lack of ability  to play all difficult parts), Silicon Messiah, Tenth Dimension. Thankfully they didn't play Stare at the Sun here probably only to butcher it too.

side notes: The camera editing was all over the place and could of been focused more on who was playing what during guitar solos. For instance, when a guitar solo is played, why the focus in on the bass player?
The extra video of Hollow Head is definitely a plus.
I firmly believe Blaze deserves a much better band.

This DVD is worth it and deserves no less than 5 stars because Blaze music is prob the best metal out there in this century.",1208649600,3,1493,4.434306569343065
8201361,5,B000RMJ4C6,"It is clear from this show that Blaze is a very good entertainer. His live performance of Maiden songs is 100 times better than that of his old days with Maiden. You will be blown away with his rendition of Futureal, Two Worlds Collide, Virus, Look For The Truth and Sign Of The Cross. He definitely knows to pick two good guitarists for his band. Each of them is clearly better than Maiden's Janick Gers and knows how to play good solos. Blaze also knows how to make his own songs sound lively and energetic. Maiden fans should petition Blaze to play all X-Factor and Virtual 11 songs live someday.",1200873600,,599,4.454545454545454
8201362,5,B000RMJ4C6,"If anything shows that the Blaze Bayley of the Iron Maiden era cops a lot of unfair flack it is this DVD. His live performance here is brilliant and shows that his time with Maiden would have much greater respect, if not for his respitory problems that caused havoc on tour (that's not to say that Bayley era Maiden was as horrible as people like to make out- X- Factor is still on of the better Maiden CD's out there IMO)

A great rendition of Look for the Truth and Sign of the Cross only furthur enhances the fact that Bayley is much better live than he is given credit for.

A+

Long Live Blaze Bayley",1196985600,3,605,4.198275862068965
