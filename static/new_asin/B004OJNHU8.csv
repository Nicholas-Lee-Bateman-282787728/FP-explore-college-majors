With that said, I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD.  The songs are great, of course, but don't expect much from the quality--from the praise dancers to the recording.  Get the CD (because it is awesome) and if you enjoy just watching his amazing choir, buy this DVD, just don't expect it to be of professional quality.  I wonder if he saw this before it was released.",1323907200,2,507,4.239583333333333

8437210,5,B004OJNHU8,"Ricky has done it again!  Mixing gospel, jazz, and R&B rhythms, Ricky Dillard and New G have produced yet another project that is sure to bless all listeners.  Be sure to check out the DVD -- as it has extras and extended versions of songs that you cannot hear on the CD.  JOB WELL DONE!!!",1309910400,,289,4.218181818181818
