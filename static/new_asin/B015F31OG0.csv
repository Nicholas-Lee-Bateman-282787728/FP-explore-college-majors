7435518,3,B015F31OG0,"Three stars is generous. The acting was pretty good, but character development was weak. One of the two guys was a complete dick and it was hard to fathom the basis for their relationship.  Some scenes rang hollow.",1455321600,,214,4.631578947368421

7435525,5,B015F31OG0,"The slippery slope to redemption is filmmaker Ken Roht's canvas in this extremely fine American independent film.  A simple but deeply satisfying story about a long-time couple reunited after a forced separation who begin navigating the murky waters of a shared past and uncertain future.

Roht (also the screenwriter) has a deft touch as he weaves the various threads and knots of the couple's life.  His dialogue is consistently pitch-perfect and is brilliantly served by the film's life-like pacing which affords the rare luxury of lingering in the film's many exquisite moments without losing sense of the story's tension, steam and trajectory. Roht's aim remains true throughout, he gets us to the end zone in a masterful way.

Roht (the original quadruple threat) also performs as one of the film's leads to dazzling effect.  His performance is simultaneously simmering, kinetic, poetic and deeply appealing.  That AND he possesses a legitimately soulful voice that the film features in several terrific music scenes.  Quite simply, this guy is on fire.

One of the film's highlights is it's exquisite use of really fine original music.  Each piece serves to enrich, punctuate and bridge-build the various themes being explored.

I'm sorry I discovered this bijoux of a film so late in it's ""run"" but I'm grateful that Amazon Prime has chosen to serve it up for further consumption.  This is a definite ""must see"" for all those interested in masterfully crafted independent film.",1489708800,5,1485,5.171548117154812
7435526,5,B015F31OG0,"This movie is fantastic, and Ken Roht did an applaudable job from directing, singing to acting.  There is no sissy, queeny drama queens in the characters, which are very often portrayed in gay movies that mislead the society stereotyping how gay men are, but two ordinary, masculine cowboys truly loved each other and built a respectable family life together.  All three main characters played by Ken Roht, Jeffrey Watkins, and William Nicol had heart-felt performances, and all the supporting actors have outstanding performances as well.  In addition, the script and the editing of the movie are also fantastic.  On top of it, the country songs in the movie are truly enjoyable.  Compared to The Brokeback Mountain, this movie is not less.",1489017600,6,741,5.090909090909091
7435527,5,B015F31OG0,"Surprisingly good music. The acting is top caliber. The characters are all authentic and completely believable. I did not expect this caliber of movie. Those unfamiliar with rural life, with horses and ranches and men, even gay men, all acting like hard-drinking hard-headed men.

7435536,3,B015F31OG0,The acting and direction were marginal.  I was never able to really connect with the characters.  The relationships are never believable.

7435537,3,B015F31OG0,"I like this movie, but there are some significant technical problems. The most glaring problem in my opinion, is the length of the movie: It is too long not because of pacing, which is fine, but it is too long because it lacks good editing.  And the primary edit should have taken place in the script, because there are way too many subtexts (i.e., stories) goin' on and the film loses focus, which then puts the production on the borderline of being like a soap opera.  The setting, in and of itself, is a story--small, country, religious community; and sittin' in the middle of it--gay dads (20 year relationship), raising a son. But then we get a bible-toting wife, overbearing mother-in-law, religious bigots, alcoholism, HIV, professional rivalry....geez...give us a break. What's the real story here?  I lost the song, in the midst of all the noise. With the exception of the actor who plays Mark, I'm not sure if there is a whole lot of real acting goin' on. Part of the charm and appeal of the rancher/cowboy life--at least to some folks--is the rather direct and unpretentious manner of the people who dedicate (or inherit) themselves to this kind of living. And most of the characters in the film communicate that down-to-earth, folksy disposition, which you don't know whether it is acting, or merely the ""actors"" playing themselves. In any case, it is believable, which is why I like the overall film. But again, it covers too much ground, and is way too long.",1483833600,,1472,4.764705882352941

7435543,4,B015F31OG0,"Just finished watching ""Perfect Cowboy"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
How do you rebuild your life and the relationships with your loved ones after a foolish night of drinking and vandalism lands you in prison for nearly four years?
It's a question a broken down cowboy named Jimmy Poole is trying to answer.  His partner Tyler, though faithful, stopped coming to see him in prison; but Tyler does pick Jimmy up and provides him with a fresh change of clothes; and brings him back to their home.  Yet the homecoming is a bittersweet one.  Tyler's son now heads up the band that Jimmy and Tyler had spent years building up; and is a much better performer than Jimmy ever was or will be.
And Jimmy is keeping a secret that will change his relationship with Tyler - but it takes a breathtaking act of violence for Jimmy to admit his unfaithfulness to Tyler while he was in prison has had life-altering consequences.
""Perfect Cowboy"" explores the foundational weaknesses and strengths of an imperfect family whose members are dealing with their own individual struggles and heartbreaks.
Strongly Recommended!
Four Stars!",1460160000,7,1123,4.931216931216931
7435544,3,B015F31OG0,"Typical gay movie.  Had potential to be a great story, but as always with gay movies, someone has to end up with HIV.  It isn't the 80's anymore.  Yes, we all know what it is and it's still a serious issue today but why is it necessary to be in nearly every gay movie story line?",1459382400,6,279,3.9464285714285716
8733376,2,B015F31OG0,"This movie was a huge disappointment.  The acting was okay but the storyline was depressing and not keeping with the title, there were no perfect cowboys to be found.  It came across as way too preachy and while the ending was okay, it was not a clear ending.  I am not waiting for the sequel and won't purchase it if one is made.",1530489600,,330,4.2063492063492065
8733377,4,B015F31OG0,"Great plot and setting that aren't usual features of gay indies. It's somewhat refreshing to see middle-aged men as leads. I couldn't give this five stars because of the side plot of Mark's wife. It didn't contribute much to the overall plot and Brandy was an entirely predictable homewrecker (although that is one home that needed to be wrecked, stat).",1519084800,,353,4.9

8733379,3,B015F31OG0,"This had the potential to be a 4/5 star low budget film...but it fell in the 2.5 star category for me.

I did enjoy watching...but I didn't feel the characters connected or had any chemistry.  I also found the sound quality to be awful...especially trying to hear Jimmy sing...and where music was kinda a primary focus, this was a big issue for me.  The three main actors all did a great job in their individual roles...but lacked together.

The story line, I thought was wonderful..with some editing it would have been excellent.  There were too many spots where loose ends weren't wrapped up and I wasn't sure the point of some the ancillary characters (ie, the religious wife and her family...a, they were horrible actors, and b, I don't think that whole story line was really needed).  I'm still a little confused on the part of the mother and what she really added to the film.  As I'm writing this, I realized that there was no sexual chemistry between Ty and Jimmy...I know they are supposed to be rugged cowboys, but I wasn't convinced they were in a 20 year relationship.  The tenderness between Jimmy and Mark was sweet, but after the fight, it needed more followup as to how they got there.

I think the writer has a lot of potential..and I'm looking forward to seeing what he writes next.

All in all, I did enjoy it...was just disappointed because it had potential to be so much more.",1496707200,,1397,4.57429718875502
8733380,4,B015F31OG0,This movie surpassed my expectations.  At first I wasn't sure because I really didn't know what it was about since the synopsis is a bit vague.  But I was pulled into the unfolding story.  The music was enjoyable and the dynamics between the characters were mostly compelling.  Overall an enjoyable film.,1496448000,,304,4.901960784313726
8733381,5,B015F31OG0,"If you read the capsule description of Perfect Cowboy you would likely peg it as a gay movie, and possibly pass it by. That would be a shame. While it is a great addition to the small catalogue of movies whose lead characters are gay, the sexuality of those characters  and others in the movie  is at times central and peripheral to their lives, just like it is for most people.

Jimmy Pooles life is complicated. After serving time for vandalizing an ATM machine in a drunken rage he returns home in rural central California to Ty, his partner of more than 20 years, Tys son Mark whom he helped raise, and Jimmys beloved country band, The Poole Boys, which Mark has been fronting while Jimmy was away. And thats just the half of it.

The ties that bind of family, faith and community are stretched and nearly broken by Jimmys return. He is an imperfectly perfect cowboy and all the more interesting for his mistakes, as is the response of all the people whose lives are changed by those mistakes. The film treats all of these characters with respect and the acknowledgment that each is every bit as complicated as Jimmy. Everyone does the best he or she can, and some rise above.

Music is central to the movie in a way Ive seldom seen. Perfect Cowboy begins and ends with Jimmy singing and the contrast between the two scenes reflects the changes he has made in his life. Elsewhere music is a vehicle for expression, connection, faith, comfort and self discovery. Thats a lot of ground to cover, and it rang true for me.

Another central theme of the movie is the importance of community. There are so many overlapping stories that it feels a little bit overstuffed. But at the end of almost two hours I wanted to know even more about these people. (Community extends to the making of the movie itself. Watch the closing credits and youll come away thinking it takes a village to make an indie movie.)

Its been a few days since Ive watched Perfect Cowboy and I find that Jimmy, Ty, Mark, Aunt Kathy and the rest of their family and friends are still on my mind. I wonder what theyll do next and I wish them well.",1493769600,,2115,4.449612403100775
8733382,5,B015F31OG0,"Unfortunately, I have a hearing problem, so I have to rely on the captioning.  In this case, it was less than 'perfect' in that a lot of dialogue was spoken without any captioning and when it did 'arrive' it flashed  so fast, again, I lost out! So, with this impediment, some of the tension between Ty and Jim was not clear. For instance, did Ty fail to visit Jim the whole time he was in prison? and if so, what was his reason? (FGSake, they were lovers for 20 years and  this deliberate avoidance of visiting Jim  was a cold hearted display of love!) It's too bad they did not give us a little more understanding of their relationship and the acceptance of it in this 'Bible Thumping town' As their confrontation conversation brought out, Ty was sort of a self-righteous person and could not understand Jim's addiction and his failure to maintain their monogamous  relationship while in prison. He apparently was without sin in both areas. and therefore a person's weaknesses wa not a good enough reason to violate his conception of right and wrong! In summation, it was a great movie, excellent acting and well directed.  I wish they would make more gay themed (subtle) movies like this instead of the iname ones that proliferate the scene today!",1492300800,,1249,4.654545454545454
8733383,3,B015F31OG0,"It's not a bad movie. But it was disappointing. The plot line is a bit jumpy and at times a bit disconnected. Some of the reactions are over done and could have had a bit more build up. I would have gone with two and a half stars if I knew how to do half stars. Wasn't real impressed with the music but it was ok. As others have said, it's no Brokeback Mountain. But it is an attempt to mainstream gay themed movies and deserves acknowledgement for that.",1491004800,,454,4.112359550561798
8733384,1,B015F31OG0,"This movie tries to portray these cowboys as the Clint Eastwood type. The only problem is with C.E. movies he's shooting and killing people to keep you interested. I was hopeing that they would shoot someone - and  I don't even like violent movies. I show my dog more affection than these two men who are to be in love. I only watched about half the movie before I called it quits. If you cut out all the music ( and it's not the best CW music ) you probably have about a half hour movie. If your desparate to see two men kiss and don't mind spending a lot of time to see them kiss then by all means watch this. If you don't want to waste you time the rent Big Eden or Undertow, these are true romantic movies.",1490659200,3,710,4.035460992907802
8733385,4,B015F31OG0,"OK, this movie might not win any awards, but it is one I know I will see a few times more. Unusual in a good way. Realistic and attitudes reflect this part of the country. Life isn't back & white; ending aren't only happy or sad. I like that this movie doesn't telling a story with a beginning and end, just a portion of peoples' lives. The gay characters' sexuality was not showcased, just the way things were.",1489968000,2,411,4.282051282051282
