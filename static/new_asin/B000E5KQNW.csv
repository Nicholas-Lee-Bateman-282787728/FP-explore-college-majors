8105843,4,B000E5KQNW,"Dante's story is told through black and white flashbacks with titles in the style of a silent movie.  In Argentina during the 1920's, Dante (Coki Debernardi) was a normal man - deliriously in love with Julia (Jazm&iacute;n Stuart), a young woman fated to die young.  On her deathbed Julia promises Dante that she will find a way to return to him and makes him promise to wait for her.  It turns into a very long wait indeed.  Somewhere along the way he makes an unholy bargain with the devil, in the guise of a priest.  He is persuaded to murder a pregnant young woman in a satanic ritual.  The priest tells him to rely on God's forgiveness, but Dante believes he has committed an unforgivable act.  When he refuses to pray, the priest condemns him to live eternally as a vampire.

Eighty years later Dante appears to be a modern guy.  As a musician and nightclub owner, he has the perfect excuse to sleep all day and roam all night.  When he awakens each night he goes to his closet and selects something from his extensive collection of sunglasses and knives.  Then he pays a visit to an underground tunnel in one of Buenos Aires' seedier districts, where he feeds on prostitutes and drug addicts.  He's a popular figure in the tunnel because Dante normally doesn't kill his victims.  Instead he pays them quite well to allow him to cut them and drink their blood.  He stops when he senses his victim is growing too weak.  There are exceptions to every rule though.

Ramirez (Gustavo Guirado) is a crooked cop assigned to the tunnel area.  He accepts money from thieves and hookers, and he's willing to turn a blind eye to the occasional exsanguinations.  As he tells his superior, ""People die in the streets all the time.""  But the commissioner cannot allow Ramirez to ignore the problem any longer when the bloodless corpses of two foreign tourists turn up.  One is an American CIA agent.  The other is an Italian representative of the Vatican.  The Church steps in and sends Homero (Gabriel Goity), a vampire hunter, to assist with the investigation.

As Homero and Ramirez search the city for the elusive vampire, Dante meets a girl named Julia who seems to be the reincarnation of his lost love.  Has his wait finally ended?  Can he make Julia realize who she was in a previous life?  And can he do it before the clock runs out?

""Tremendo Amanacer"" isn't slick or polished; it's neither overly scary nor gory.  As someone who's not particularly fascinated by the vampires or the current wave of TV shows and films about them, I didn't love the movie but I enjoyed it.  The details on how Dante is made a vampire, and Homero's lectures to Ramirez on arcane vampire lore were unusual.  I thought the Buenos Aires setting and the lost love/reincarnation aspect of the story make this an interesting and different take on the vampire legend.  Three and a half stars.",1252800000,4,2870,4.612648221343873
8105844,2,B000E5KQNW,"I did not like this movie. First of all, I think the vampire should be handsome and seducing and the actor interpreting him is uglier than anything. Besides, the ending does not make too much sense, even for a vampire movie.",1237766400,,224,4.487804878048781
