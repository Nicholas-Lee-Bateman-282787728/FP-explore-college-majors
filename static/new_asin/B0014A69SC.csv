8254777,5,B0014A69SC,"My kids are addicted to these songs!  Some of the animations appear a little cheezy to me, but if the kids like it, it must be alright!  It's so hard to find a good music DVD in Spanish.  Thanks Manuelita!",1428537600,,205,4.075
8254778,3,B0014A69SC,"The songs are beautiful and in good quality, this DVD it's great entertaining for the kids.
However, the video quality is poor, the motion picture smeared.",1393718400,,155,5.0
8254779,1,B0014A69SC,"The songs are lovely in this DVD and it is incredibly creative.  The people who produced it are very talented artistically.  However, it is TERRIBLE for a toddler.  It is way too busy and impossible to hear the songs properly because the music iis so hectic. The images move lightning speed anyway but it is very bad quality video - it's almost as though the images vibrate.  Nice idea but don't ruin your child's eyes with this.  I returned it for a refund.",1285804800,3,458,4.469879518072289
