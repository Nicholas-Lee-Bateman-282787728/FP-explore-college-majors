Along side 'The Vietnam War' I would rate this as an extremely important film, for civilians and veterans alike.",1531699200,,169,5.035714285714286

8735534,5,B01648P5LK,"A documentary that should be mandatory for every American to watch. An inside look into the sacrifices our great veterans make, and how going to war is only half the battle.

8735535,5,B01648P5LK,"This documentary was informative and eye-opening.  The film went sequentially:  Revolutionary War, Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Iraq & Afghanistan.  Each new segments started with statistics on the screen:  how many troops were enlisted, killed, and  wounded.

The film described the physical, and mental / emotional effects of combat on soldiers along with the public's perceptions of war / injuries and changing attitudes throughout time.  Soldier's Heart (probably PTSD) was brought out during the Civil War segment.  The documentary did a good job of examining the soldiers' physical and emotional injuries of war.

Medical advancements of World War II included understanding infection and how to control it, increasing ability to do blood transfusions, rapid removal from the battlefield, and the first helicopter evacuation of wounded in Burma.

The public's insensitivity to war is best demonstrated by this sign at Quantico Marine Corp Base:  ""America is not at war.  The Marine Corp is at war.  America is at the mall.""",1478390400,2,1066,5.311377245508982
8735536,5,B01648P5LK,Truly inspiring-all Veterans and people involved with Veterans and Disabled Veterans should almost be required to view this video.,1454112000,,130,5.894736842105263
8735537,5,B01648P5LK,"This is an amazing look at the sacrifices made by American soldiers from the Revolutionary War to now, and how the medical community has evolved and responded to demand as our ability to injure more people at once improves.  There is a great underlying medical ethics question that is raised as we are able to bring more and more people back to ""alive"" than before.  It really opens the eyes of the average person who probably doesn't understand what, exactly, soldiers deal with when injured and returned home.  I wish everyone could watch this.  It's really an important video for Americans to view.",1451001600,,601,4.805825242718447
8735538,5,B01648P5LK,Saw the film on PBS and wanted for my classroom.  Perfect for Veteran's Day or any other time when you wish to raise awareness for American Vets.,1450569600,,145,4.37037037037037
