3822197,5,B001VFM0Y2,"When I was a kid I love watching Spaceballs and other movies made by Mel Brooks.  When I heard a lot about the animated series I was excited.  But first I get the chance to watch Spaceballs: The Totally Warped Animated Adventures.  Watching this brings back a lot of memories, even though it's a lot different between the animation and the original movie.  I even watch it with my family and it made them bring back memories.  Plus it's great to hear Mel Brooks is lending his voice along with Daphne Zuniga and Joan Rivers.  So if you're a longtime fan of Mel Brooks and Spaceballs, ignore the negative reviews and pick up a copy today.

And one last message to all the longtime Spaceballs fans:  May the schwartz be with you!",1268352000,4,727,4.454545454545454
3822198,3,B001VFM0Y2,"Mel Brooks Spaceballs is in the top 5, if not my favorite movie of all time. So it would only be natural that I would want to get this DVD of the new toon series. Judging from reading about the show being canceled, and a few reviewers saying how bad it was when they saw it on T.V (Which i never got to do) I really was not expecting much at all when I surprisingly got confirmation that this DVD had been shipped (they had canceled it previously, but it's back again now)

It's a shame there is only 4 episodes. The 4 episodes are not exactly faithful to what you know about Spaceballs, but that does not mean they should be dismissed, as I laughed all the way through each episode. There is a couple of times you get a little disorientated wondering why Lonestar and Princess Vespa are not married, or why Sanders and Helmet would call for Lonestars help... but aside from that, Mel could have had a successful series here, had it been given a chance to get some of the kinks out like most first series do... but oh well, what can you do about it now?

Mel returns as the voice of President Skroob and Yogurt, as with Daphene Whats-her-name as Vespa & Joan Rivers as Dot Matrix.... the rest of the characters voices you can get used to, except for Cornell Sanders voice, that one really needed to be re-cast.

Surprisingly the humor was not censured out. I was expected a completely G rated cartoon here, but it's more a PG rated one that pushes the boundary of it. I was surprised at the sexual innuendos and language portrayed, which just made me like it. Had they gone a little bit more raunchier and smuttier, it could have contended with South Park and such shows.

As long as you go in not expecting a masterpeice, then you should enjoy what this show has to offer. Just sit back and remember, it's just for laughs.

Shame there is no bonus features at all :(",1262995200,10,1867,4.322857142857143
3822199,2,B001VFM0Y2,"There are only 4 of the 13 episodes on the disk. The flash animation is less smooth than an episode of ""Homestar Runner"". It is definitely NSFW (PG-13 at best) The voice work is top notch but that cannot save it.",1398556800,2,212,4.195121951219512
3822200,5,B001VFM0Y2,"Mel Brooks is a Master of Humour. This film marked a point in film where parody and slapstick were perfectly balanced with decent production. Are the effects as good as Star Wars? No. But for a feature film it is bloody well good enough. This appeals to such a broad audience of young and old. Some of the jokes are dated, but most of the humour is truly timeless and will stand the test of time.",1388188800,,396,4.223684210526316
3822201,1,B001VFM0Y2,"This is a horrible transition from the movie, it appears that the writers were hired from porn sets. The sexual innuendos were way over the top for a rated PG movie. .",1380067200,2,167,4.25
3822202,5,B001VFM0Y2,I didn't watch this. Purchased it for a friend for her birthday. I bought it used and in great condition.,1378944000,,105,4.3
3822203,2,B001VFM0Y2,"Overly sexual and not up to the comedy standards that, anyone who likes Mel Brooks, would expect from him. I bought it for my kids to watch but there is just way too much explicit sexual content.

Very disappointed",1376438400,,214,4.487179487179487
3822204,1,B001VFM0Y2,The original was funny on several levels. This cartoon ripoff just goes straight to the gross and overly sexualized. Avoid,1372204800,,122,5.15
3822205,1,B001VFM0Y2,"I love spaceballs, but this is terrible and not in a good way.  I don't think Mel Brooks had any hand in the writing because the ""plot"" sucks.",1364256000,2,142,4.071428571428571
3822206,1,B001VFM0Y2,"I hate this cartoon.  I watched it a friends house.  His little brother had bought the series and was watching it.  I can't believe that Mel Brooks (the man who crafted Young Frankenstein FOR CRYING OUT LOUD) would make such an aweful series.  It's nothing like the original movie.  On top of that, Rick Moranis isn't in it AND John Candy has been dead for years.
  Anyone who is thinking of buying this series seriously needs to think before doing so.  It's a waste of money.",1355356800,,476,4.453488372093023
3822207,5,B001VFM0Y2,I did not regret getting this dvd. This dvd was very funny. You will regret if you do not buy this dvd. I think they made this show a bit too late should have made it ten years ago.,1325289600,,181,3.6666666666666665
3822208,5,B001VFM0Y2,"If you are a Mel Brooks fan or just enjoy good parody, I highly recommend this series. It flew under the radar when it was produced a few years back, and it's a shame, because it beats the heck out of what passes for parody these days. It belongs on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, because I honestly think it would find it's audience there. The animation is good, the voice work is top notch honestly, and the parodies of recent movies, and issues like steroid use in sports and video games is really well handled. There is an episode that sort of updates Spaceballs to include the new Star Wars movies, telling the origin of Dark Helmet called Revenge of the Sithee. There are parodies of Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings, Spiderman and Pirates of the Caribbean just to name a few. All of the episodes are just excellent! This is as close as we'll ever come to seeing Mel Brooks' parody these properties, and his humor is definitely as sharp as ever. The language is rough, and there are many references to bodily functions and lots of sex jokes, so it's not for kids. Fans of Family Guy will appreciate this show very much. It reminds me somewhat of the Clerks Animated show, (another series that missed it's audience) though I have to say, 100 times funnier.

The art of parody is almost lost, and Brooks was the King. Do yourself a favor and pick this set up.

I do think it's a terrible shame that only 4 episodes are included in this set. There were 13 in all, and I think it would be a much bigger seller if they were ALL included.",1325030400,3,1537,4.370629370629371

8346210,2,B001VFM0Y2,"Before you even consider buying this: The DVD only contains 4 of the original 13 episodes. Why? I have no idea. Because as disappointing as this series was (limited original cast doing voice talent, bland writing, and very little of the original movie's humor has translated into the show), it was far more disappointing that for whatever reason they decided to only include a portion of the episodes when they made this disc. And honestly, based on the choices they've made as to which particular episodes made the cut, after reading the Wiki page detailing the other ones that they've excluded (incuding parodies of the Star Wars trilogy, Lord of the Rings, James Bond, Jurassic Park, amonst others) it would almost seem like the episodes that were selected are probably the least interesting ones. By the time I got through to the (surprise!) last episode on the DVD, there were actually flashes of hope that it might be improving slightly. And then the episode ended, and there were no more on the disc.

Visually, it was surprisingly good looking, especially considering that it's not even HD, and the animation is passable, but again, the writing and lack of overall humor left me wanting more. All things considered, I'm fairly sure that your money would be better spent on the 25th anniversary edition of Spaceballs (I've been told it's an impressive collection), or elsewhere.",1402704000,4,1385,4.944206008583691
