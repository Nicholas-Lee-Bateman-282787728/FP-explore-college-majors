4899863,5,B005WTG698,I watched this movie the other day and cried.  It's hard enough for kids to enter high school but when they stick out for some reason it's even harder.  I just fell in love with Jimmy and his drive to make things better for himself.  I loved this movie!!,1346112000,2,254,4.142857142857143
4899864,5,B005WTG698,"This terrific movie tells the story of an overweight high school freshman, Jimmy Winterpock, who finally makes the decision to lose weight after relentless bullying. His effort to shed the pounds isn't easy and his goal isn't achieved overnight, which is part of what makes this such a good movie: Jimmy's journey becomes allegorical for any human struggle to do something worthwhile and against the odds. The young teen's strong relationships with his family and church add to what is an uplifting and encouraging story.

Besides the central character, other struggling teens are depicted in the movie with nuance and sensitivity, broadening the scope of what is already a far-reaching plot.

Highly recommended!",1337040000,,713,5.300884955752212
4899865,5,B005WTG698,"The 411:
Obesity is something I am extremely sensitive about. Growing up with overweight parents my mother was extremely overweight and my dad yoyo'd all the time. My sister grew up hearing all the horrible names and sayings kids say to kids who are different than them.  She is now a very comfortable, confident, overweight woman but as children, it hurt me to hear the kids say such terrible things to her.  I completely empathize with Jimmy.

Jimmy is a sweet faced boy starting a new school who is teased by not only the kids in school but by his own sister.  My heart hurt watching him teased in the locker room by the other boys. School is hard enough but so many children are never taught how to be accepting of others.

Even the adults in the movies, like the teachers and parents of friends are just plain rude and mean. Which is just disgraceful but very real. My sister no longer speaks with my grandmother because so many never realize that their words effect people.

One of Jimmy's teachers gives an assignment about keeping a journal which becomes the narrative basis of the movie. We get to hear Jimmy's thoughts throughout the movie about his real feelings.

It broke my heart watching Jimmy struggle with his feelings and his emotions. If nothing else, I would hope a movie like this would show kids how NOT to treat others.

After his doctor tells him he is only 14 and 188 pounds that he is a little overweight. Jimmy tells the doctor about the students and teachers making fun of him and the he doctor explains to him that if he doesn't lose weight teasing will be the least of his problems.

Jimmy starts a weight loss plan on his own with a goal. He starts running and eating better.

My favorite parts of the movie are how supportive and encouraging his parents are. His father running with him and his mother meeting him at the end of his runs. Very cute! Everyone needs support.

While the message of this movie is about bullying and the affect it has on others, there was so much more to it. All of the young characters have flaws. One girl is a cutter, the popular kid has trouble in school, Jimmy's best friend Paul has an alcoholic father who ignores him. Underneath we all have problems that make us weak, that hurt our hearts, that make us different, but if we learn to accept others differences and not see them as faults we will all be better off.

Jimmy has a lot to deal with but thanks to the love of his parents, friends and even an ex bully he comes out on top in the long run.

Positives of the movie:

  Parents who are there for their kids
  Families who go to church together
  Friendship
  Perseverance
  Will power
  Commitment
  Journaling
  Learning acceptance

The young actors in this movie do an incredible job especially by Christopher Rivera!",1325548800,17,2794,4.484126984126984

Obesity and bullying is one of the top main concerns in the United States and this movie is very inspiring in finding ourselves and motivating to change our health and life. In middle and most of high school I struggled with weight and I was often called fat and ugly by girls and even guys. I never gave up, probably because I was not afraid to fight and talk back to my bullies; but I was not well liked. I can relate to this movie a lot, I decided to change my life just like him I look muscular now, I train boxing, and while my bullies did not succeed and went on to graduate from college and get a good job.

We found it to be a great film so watch with my step sons. They are at an age that we are trying to aid in the direction of their moral compass. Loving and respecting others. Being kind in action and word. Loving themselves and making their lives intentional.

This movie receives 8 thumbs up! And eight outta eight ain't bad!

4899959,5,B005WTG698,"I've been super pleased lately at how many family friendly, moral movies are coming out. As I've mentioned before many times they have lower budgets, and because of this do come off a little hokey. After viewing the front, reading the title, and reading the back cover I fully expected this movie to be hokey, and in all honesty I wasn't sure how crazy I'd be about it--especially hubby since he doesn't like anything corny at all.

After watching the movie I turned to hubby and said, ""that was SO CUTE!!!!"" It was true! This movie far exceeded my expectations and was a delightful date night movie. Even hubby admitted that he liked it (don't tell him I told you that) It follows the path of Jimmy throughout the year. It shows his path towards self improvement, self discovery, and self growth. I love how it showed what real and extremely difficult situations and lives that teenagers today have and live. It was so much more than just a movie about a ""fat kid"" who was being bullied. Family friendly it will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy--and I would recommend it for families with older kids or anyone who'd like a nice, clean, cute movie--even for a ""date night"".

Even first graders know a bully in their school and although being a nurse i realize these kids have issues not related to the bullying that need to be addressed.

4899962,5,B005WTG698,"I used this film for writing in summer school this year. I taught a group of girls ages 14-17.  I love to find books and movies my students, who are adjudicated delinquents, wouldn't normally choose for themselves. Many of them usually prefer gore,violence and sex in movies and books, so I always try to find ways of inspiring them and introducing uplifting themes. After watching the movie with the girls group, I bought a class set of the books to use in the fall with groups. I like to introduce them at times to independent films with unknown actors and without all the trappings of Hollywood. I want them to look beyond all the glitter to the heart of the themes.

  This movie focused on learning to accept the differences of others. It is about a boy,Jimmy Winterpock, who is overweight, yet intelligent and sincere. He has all the desirable traits of a good friend: loyal, honest, supportive in times of crises. But, he's young (just entering high school)and naive. He wants to fit in, but still maintain his integrity. With all of that to offer, some of the popular kids still only see him as ""fat"". However, one of the ""goth"" type girls can see through the exterior to his great personality. She accepts him as he is and this stirs him to WANT to change his weight, even though she likes him just the way he is.

  I gave it 5 stars because this movie is a good teaching tool for topics like bullying, domestic abuse, peer pressure, friendship and change. There are no ""Academy Award"" performances, but everyone did a fine acting job. We were able to use it for a variety of writing experiences like journaling, poetry writing, character sketching, and simple paragraph responses to movie situations. It also provided the text for formal discussion (Socratic Seminars)in which students were able to dig deep and discuss how it feels to be different, how to accept oneself and make any necessary changes.  I will be using the book next month as our group novel. I still have to read it, but perusing it, I found that it is written in the form of journal entries to his teacher. He writes a lot of poetry and we're able to see more into his thinking. The 5 stars are for its ability to help my students grow.",1350864000,8,2217,4.552763819095477

I still fight with this today even though I have lost weight and people tell me I am pretty now.. it is not something I believe I struggle everyday with it and all I see when I look in the mirror is that Fat girl. This movie really hit home and was a great message.",1487980800,,509,4.0

Again, family oriented and shows snippets of life that actually occur more frequently than we like to acknowledge. No matter how people try there is always some ""BLOCK BRAIN"" that thinks people who are different should be ridiculed, scorned, shamed, humiliated. Let's hear it for the underdog!! Good job.",1487635200,,385,5.015625
