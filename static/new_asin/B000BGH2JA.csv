8086346,2,B000BGH2JA,"How did one reviewer put it? ""A bit grainy"".  Well, there's more grain than an Acapulco beach. Clear resolution was also wanting. Too distracting.  Audio was hit and miss.  Not expecting a Criterion transfer but compared to a Universal Vault or Warner Archive transfer the Geneon transfer just didn't cut the mustard.",1509667200,,317,5.0576923076923075

8086349,3,B000BGH2JA,"I love Fred MacMurray, but this one is not one of his best. Also, the quality of the dvd is poor, very fuzzy and out of focus. What a shame.",1345248000,,140,3.7
8086350,4,B000BGH2JA,I have to state up front that I have always been a fan of Fred MacMurray's comedies of the 1930s and 1940s so when I found this one; one I had never heard of I was excited. I wasn't disappointed - It was laugh out loud funny in parts - fast moving overall and a nice way to spend an evening,1214956800,7,290,3.7704918032786887
8086351,3,B000BGH2JA,"DON'T TRUST YOUR HUSBAND (aka ""An Innocent Affair"" and ""Under Suspicion"") is mainly notable for featuring Fred MacMurray and Madeleine Carroll in their fifth--and final--screen pairing.

The story revolves around suspicious wife Paula Doane (Madeleine Carroll) who suspects her ad-executive husband Vincent (Fred MacMurray) of carrying on with one of his clients.  She hires a handsome actor to make him jealous, only for the plan to backfire when the man she unwittingly attracts is the Southern tobacco tycoon Claude Kimball (Charles ""Buddy"" Rogers).  In the meanwhile, Vincent decides to have a little fun too, taunting Paula with his alleged mistress, Mrs Fraser (Louise Allbritton).

DON'T TRUST YOUR HUSBAND is a sparkling sex farce filled with expert performances.  I wish MacMurray and Carroll's screen partnership hadn't ended here.  The supporting cast is first-rate with Rita Johnson, Alan Mowbray and Pierre Watkin.

This budget-line DVD from Geneon features a decent quality print.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).",1180224000,11,1030,5.686274509803922
8086352,4,B000BGH2JA,"This slick domestic farce showcases the talents of likeable 1940s B-team Fred MacMurray and Madeleine Carroll, along with a fine supporting cast that includes Rita Johnson ('The Big Clock,' 'Here Comes Mr. Jordan') and Alan Mowbray ('I Wake Up Screaming,' 'That Uncertain Feeling').  The story will be familiar to fans of the genre-- a wealthy bumpkin (Buddy Rogers), via the usual dose of absurd screwball contrivance, becomes the object of expedient affection of spoiled wife Carroll, who suspects ad-exec husband MacMurray of carrying on an affair with a client.  What unfolds is a gently acerbic take on the pitfalls of 'modern' marriage that turns alternately frantic and tender at all the right spots.  The transfer, while relatively flaw-free, is a bit grainy, but certainly well above the average quality of a budget print (Geneon seldom has let me down in that respect).  At first blush, the awkwardly titled 'Don't Trust Your Husband' may play like a poor man's 'The Awful Truth,' but this little-known gem is still fresher and funnier than 95 percent of what passes for comedy these days.  3 1/2 stars.",1168560000,7,1113,5.060109289617486
