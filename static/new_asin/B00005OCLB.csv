7948613,5,B00005OCLB,This was an excellent DVD.  My children and grandchildren enjoyed this fast paced beautiful California adventure with all the wonder that makes California a beautiful place to live or visit.  From the soaring sky dancers to the beautiful redwoods this is a DVD to see.  Watching how they photographed these sites was just as interesting.  This DVD was purchased at Amazon.,1286841600,,372,5.049180327868853

This is a great way to spend an evening in front of the TV and enjoying the great music, visuals, and scenery. The Golden Gate Bridge shots are amazing. Highly recommended !! And if it plays at an IMAX near you, DON'T MISS IT!!!!",1078185600,,298,4.339285714285714

7948618,3,B00005OCLB,"I saw the theatrical version of this movie about 3 months ago and just got the DVD release.  I thought the film was great when I saw it in the IMAX theater at the Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC.  However, the DVD just didn't look right to me.  The vibrant colors that I saw in the theater were not there and the soundtrack was not transfered very well to either DD 5.1 or DTS 5.1.  The DVD was a disappointment.  The video quality of the ""Making of"" feature was not worthy of DVD release.
I own about a dozen IMAX films on DVD.  This and another one that I bought at the same time could have been better.  Both were released by Image Entertainment.  I have gotten some real low quality DVD releases from Image Entertainment and this continues the trend for me.",1007942400,10,768,4.248275862068965
7948619,5,B00005OCLB,"The first Imax movie I ever saw was Everest and I loved it- each and every one of my several viewings.  I never imagined that another Imax movie could surpass the enthusiasm I felt for Everest.  Seeing Adventures In Wild California changed all that.  I was thoroughly entertained,  absorbed, and amazed from beginning to end.  The movie opens with incredible sky surfing footage accompanied with a perfect choice of music.  The opening put a smile on my face and sent a sense of awe through my system that didn't diminish until well past the closing credits.  The good news is - the rest of the film really rocks also.  Another highlight for example is the footage of the big waves at Mavericks.  The waves themselves are unbelievable, but so is the footage of the surfers surfing and ""attempting"" to surf them.  I loved it and I don't even surf!  I believe ""awe"" is the best word used to describe how I felt throughout much of the film,  I found myself in awe again when the Imax cameras moved to the groves of Giant Sequoias that were referred to as ""sacred"".  The movie inspired me to search out the Sequoias and I was amazed to learn that as an Orange County resident they were only 4 hours from my house - including the biggest tree in the world - General Sherman.  A short hike from General Sherman is the Washington Tree - the tree featured in the movie!  A weekend trip to the giant Sequoias gave confirmation to the word ""sacred.""  If I had not seen ""Adventures"" I'm sure I never would have visited such a remarkable place.  I'm thankful to ""Adventures"" for inspiring my trip. There's a lot more great stuff in the movie that I haven`t mentioned and I would highly recommend checking it out.  Unfortunately, I imagine the DVD won't have the same impact as the BIG screen, but I will still be first in line on the 20th to eagerly add this DVD to my collection.",1005696000,9,1868,4.460176991150442
