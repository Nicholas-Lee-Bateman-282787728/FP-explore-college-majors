3064409,3,B0011D6FH2,"The movie was very cool. But, to me at least, there is something missing when the American voice overs are missing. They give a quality to the character (inspiring or cheesy) that is hard to capture from well written subtext or cool animation. I would tell most people to wait until you are sure you get the English dubbed version of the movie if you don't speak Japanese--so much is happening in such a quick period of time that it is  just too easy to want to choose reading vs. watching. And the Japanese inflection of words when speaking seems dull to the situation when you don't understand the language or cultural nuances presented.",1242259200,10,639,4.605263157894737
3064410,5,B0011D6FH2,"After training with Master Jiraiya for two and a half years, learning to defend himself from those who would harm him for the powers of the Nine Tailed Fox within him, Naruto returns to the Leaf village. Still a Genin while his friends Sakura, Rock Lee and Neji have gone on missions and trained to advance in rank, Naruto joins the new Team Kakashi led by Jonin Neji. Assigned to a mission to protect a priestess from the Land of Demons, the team escorts her to the Land of Swamps where she must perform the binding ritual to bind an escaped demon to prevent him from conquering the five nations and ruling for a thousand years. Fans of the anime series will enjoy Naruto's hijinks, humor and strong determination to succeed. The action and challenges to the team make this an entertaining addition to the Naruto story. The prediction of Naruto's death, with funeral scenes, keeps you on the edge of your seat as the movie unfolds. My whole family enjoyed this movie as a fine tale from the Naruto universe. A caveat for some is the movie is in Japanese with english subtitles.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Movie-Naruto-Shippuden/dp/B0011D6FH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Movie-Naruto Shippuden</a>",1230422400,8,1244,5.287878787878788

3064428,3,B0011D6FH2,"I know its been out for a while, but lo and behold, I have done at least some catching up with the Naruto anime lately (and the end of the manga, or at least the end for now). And now that the newer set of movies from the latter half of the series, Naruto Shippuden, are available for streaming, I was finally able to take a look at the first movie of the new series, simply titled Naruto Shippuden: The Movie. After seeing this movie, I don't think I missed much. In fact, this movie was so full of its own tropes, I may as well have already watched it before.
 This is, of course, not to say that the movie is terrible or even bad. Its quite adequate, actually. The animation, as with all of the movies with their much higher production budget, is absolutely beautiful and fluid, far more so than the typical episode of the anime. The voice acting (I watched the dub because thats what I prefer) is just fine, and no better or worse than the show. Each of the voices fit the characters well and the actors do just as well. So there are no real problems with the acting, animation, or overall production of this anime film; they're all just fine. The problems with this film all stem from its clichd narrative. The plot and new characters take absolutely no risks or deviation from standard action anime films in this genre. In fact, in many respects, these Naruto films have formed tropes unique unto themselves.
 The film starts off with a false shocker ending, in-media-res. I could instantly tell its a red herring because of the title, so I wasn't really fazed by it. We are then quickly introduced to our tragic, tsundere, damsel-in-distress heroine for the evening, the priestess Shion. Immediately noticeable is that her character design, if not characterization, is strikingly similar to Hinata Hyugas in Shippuden. Its so obvious and jarring, its actually kind of odd that none of the other characters mention it, not even Neji. Shes voiced in the dub by veteran Laura Bailey, who does quite well as portraying her snobbishness as well as her sadness and compassion. Shes not too terribly complex however, as her backstory of fate and sacrifice and all that jazz has not only been done a million times in anime and fiction in the past, but also in just this series. In fact, much of her attitude and eventual character arc strongly echoes that of the heroine from the first Naruto movie, Yukie Fujikaze from Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow. She just seems to be a conglomeration of previous characters and arcs, with not much else to her as a character. Unfortunately, much of the rest of this film plays out in the same fashion.
 The plot is so standard, it practically can be called note by note. Shion is the only daughter of the former priestess, and is the only person who can seal the ancient evil known as Sauron Moryo, whom was defeated by her mother at the cost of her own life. A group of evil ninja whose names are inconsequential as they're just there as cannon fodder for the heroes to curb stomp in the third act revive the spirit of Moryo and his unstoppable army of mindless Orcs Terracotta Warriors. They plan to use Moryos power to take over the world. Naruto and his team are assigned to escort Shion to the Land of Mordor Swamps where she can seal Moryos body forever. Yukie Shion is at first a spoiled brat and a firm believer in predetermined fate like Neji, and is content to be sacrificed for the good of her people. Naruto eventually wins her over with his ninja way and unflinching determination, and she falls for him. He eventually destroys the evil Moryo, who it turns out is some kind of eternal Cthulu demon without a clear origin, with his Rasengan combined with the special flavor of the day chakra from Shion, and the movie just kind of stops as the credits roll. An after credits scene once again showcases Narutos stupidity and naivet, and were done.
 As you can see, this film hits not only tons of action and anime clichs, but also tons of tropes from just the Naruto anime and the other theatrical films. The plot flows in such a familiar and predictable fashion, that your predictions for what will happen next will be better than Shions. Yes, the story and characters are overused to the point of tiredness, except when it ups the weirdness factor to eleven and comes right the heck out of nowhere. Shions ability to predict the future isn't really explained very well, nor do we come to fully understand its rules or origins. Moryo himself is an enigma, as we don't where he/it came from or why it wants to destroy the world; hes just evil I guess. His minions that awaken him are similarly given no backstory or reason for their actions, so they're just evil bad guys too. Heck, I cant even remotely remember their names, if they even had any. At some point, there is what I surmise is some sort of Transformation Jutsu thats permanent, used by one of Shions male vassals to impersonate her, which makes it kind of a magic sex-change-no-jutsu. You explain that one. Its just odd that thats a thing in this world. The climax with Moryo is ridiculously confusing. Something about Shion sacrificing herself, possibly going back in time to undo Narutos death, or something. It all goes by so fast and without enough explanation to make sense of it; in the end, Im not really sure what happened. Also, Naruto himself seems a touch more annoying that usual, and not in a well-done manner. And one of the voice actors is Wil Wheaton. Yes, THAT Wil Wheaton. Hes not bad, but thats downright bizarre.
 In the end, its not outright terrible, but it is overly predictable. The new characters are reused cutouts, and the established characters are underutilized and fail to compensate. Shion is interesting enough of a character that I wish I could see more of her in future projects in the series, which of course won't happen because shes one-note filler fodder. Honestly, I wouldnt say this film is a necessary watch for this series; nothing is lost to the mythos by skipping it. Of course, if you are a fan of the show/manga and know what to expect, its a decent way to kill and hour and a half.",1429660800,,6141,4.5438121047877145

Naruto's friends Neji, Sakura and Rock Lee tag along for this adventure. Rock Lee' shows off his ""Drunken Fist"" in this one! This movie was fun and I do recommend it to everyone.",1363651200,,543,4.376237623762377

Naruto's efforts to protect himself from his terrible fate are vaguely annoying; as usual, the subtle humor present elsewhere in the film is much more amusing.

The movies seem to drag a bit too long for me, without enough 'thrills at every corner' to keep me on the edge of my seat.  I'd recommend the movie for Naruto fans, but of course if you are a fan then you will see it regardless of what I say!",1265155200,2,427,4.182926829268292
3064483,3,B0011D6FH2,"I expected alot from this movie, probally too much, cause i love all things naruto, but i was reall let down.  The characters just kind of complained back and forth to each other, the action wasn't that great, with the exception of rock lee's fight scene in it, which was pretty cool. I think i expected eveyone to have the 1 on 1 action scene the show use to have when they were younger, but overall the movie was just ok.",1260748800,3,423,4.222222222222222
3064484,3,B0011D6FH2,"The first film of the series is a good offering considering that it technically constitutes as filler, but to tell you the truth, filler with a good production value is alright for me as a casual fan.  Though it doesn't advance the main story much, actually it's a bit difficult to try and place this story within the series, but it is soon forgiven for the action is awesome (especially good if you're a fan of Rock Lee)and it heightens the devices the series tends to use sparingly (CGI effects).

  I won't trouble you by spoiling the story, it's bland and easily understood, aaaaaaaand the execution of the story is one that you've seen before in many other Naruto movies.  In fact, if anyone can tell me a Naruto movie that advances the main story, please let me know, I haven't seen them all and I'm starting to see an awkward pattern that could turn me off to the movies, but my fandom menace won't let me stop buying them.

  All in all, for those of you who are buying the volumes individually, treat this as an optional supplement to tide you over until the next volume is released.  For those of you who are still waiting patiently to get your first hit of Shippuden in full in January, then you won't even notice this movie and probably buy it for kicks.  For those of you who like to watch Rock Lee do his thing again (including his drunken fist) then cop this in full confidence.

  The villains in this movie are creative, but that's a bar that the series set for itself and at this point we expect no less, so really it's nothing truly outstanding from the series' standards.  The CGI used in this is considerable but does skim the boundary of gratuitous (sure it saves money, but do we really NEED it? it doesn't necessarily communicate with the animated characters well, but this movie manages to keep you from saying anything negative about it while it's going)

  So all I have to say is that I wasn't disappointed in buying this, I got action at a time length comparable to a volume of the series and I got to see my favorite characters from the Naruto universe thwart yet another threat to the world...but as long as the regions that encompass the Naruto main story are left untouched, then I wouldn't mind seeing the rest of the world plunge into an oblivion of weaponized chakra...",1259625600,,2305,4.476076555023924
3064485,2,B0011D6FH2,Yea this movie is alright not worth buying tho in the whole movie there is only one good fight seen between rock lee and some guy that uses earth and fire justu,1258588800,3,160,4.03125
3064486,5,B0011D6FH2,"Naruto: Shippuden- The Movie is a great experience and first entry for a movie set in the Shippuden storyline period.  The movie does a great job at capitilizing upon the fact that Naruto just returned to the Hidden Leaf Village and has not gone out on many missions nor has he seen everyone just yet.  In fact in this movie when he teams up with Neji, Lee, and Sakura, the writers make it appear that this is Naruto's first time encountering Neji and Lee since his arrival.  Generally speaking, the movie focuses on this team's mission of protecting a very important person and leading her to the designated destination. With evil afoot, they must use multiple tricks in their ninja handbooks to ensure success of their mission.

I loved it, and although most of them do not use any new jutsu since the first season of Naruto (possibly Lee uses more of the gates of opening than was seen during his fight against Gaara during the Chunin exams), it is memorable to sit back and listen to the jutsu (and nearly say word for word what the character says).  I was also intrigued by the medical ninjutsu of the enemies.

The movie excels in being a great film for fans and some newcomers since it is light on the background material and easy on the narrative.  I loved the incorporation of multiple 3D effects such as 3D environments and planes/enemies.  It looked well put together and actually flowed with the 2D imagery.  Music was also on key with the Naruto Shippuden theme appearing in the usual places and some ""made for the movie"" tunes pumping us up for the events.

For the DVD, my version seemed to lack the option for subtitles, and only included the English audio, no special features, nor subtitles.  Cover art to the DVD is amazing with both the design on the disc, as well as the design of the cover.  This is definitely a must buy for Naruto fans, even with the lack of special features (seemed the only movie that VIZ has made that has had numerous features was the first Bleach Movie).",1258156800,,2000,4.540389972144847

If you read between the lines the product description does say dubbed. I am sure Amazon will fix the error in the audio part when enough of you complain. As far as the dvd what can I say its Naruto, so it totally rocks. I like English dub, my daughter likes to watch the Japanese with subs so we are both happy with this release. And yes I gotta love the fact we get new release's early due to family that work in the right places, so enjoy this one when the rest of you get the chance.

3298906,3,B0011D6FH2,"The movie was very cool. But, to me at least, there is something missing when the American voice overs are missing. They give a quality to the character (inspiring or cheesy) that is hard to capture from well written subtext or cool animation. I would tell most people to wait until you are sure you get the English dubbed version of the movie if you don't speak Japanese--so much is happening in such a quick period of time that it is  just too easy to want to choose reading vs. watching. And the Japanese inflection of words when speaking seems dull to the situation when you don't understand the language or cultural nuances presented.",1242259200,10,639,4.605263157894737
3298907,5,B0011D6FH2,"After training with Master Jiraiya for two and a half years, learning to defend himself from those who would harm him for the powers of the Nine Tailed Fox within him, Naruto returns to the Leaf village. Still a Genin while his friends Sakura, Rock Lee and Neji have gone on missions and trained to advance in rank, Naruto joins the new Team Kakashi led by Jonin Neji. Assigned to a mission to protect a priestess from the Land of Demons, the team escorts her to the Land of Swamps where she must perform the binding ritual to bind an escaped demon to prevent him from conquering the five nations and ruling for a thousand years. Fans of the anime series will enjoy Naruto's hijinks, humor and strong determination to succeed. The action and challenges to the team make this an entertaining addition to the Naruto story. The prediction of Naruto's death, with funeral scenes, keeps you on the edge of your seat as the movie unfolds. My whole family enjoyed this movie as a fine tale from the Naruto universe. A caveat for some is the movie is in Japanese with english subtitles.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Movie-Naruto-Shippuden/dp/B0011D6FH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Movie-Naruto Shippuden</a>",1230422400,8,1244,5.287878787878788

3298925,3,B0011D6FH2,"I know its been out for a while, but lo and behold, I have done at least some catching up with the Naruto anime lately (and the end of the manga, or at least the end for now). And now that the newer set of movies from the latter half of the series, Naruto Shippuden, are available for streaming, I was finally able to take a look at the first movie of the new series, simply titled Naruto Shippuden: The Movie. After seeing this movie, I don't think I missed much. In fact, this movie was so full of its own tropes, I may as well have already watched it before.
 This is, of course, not to say that the movie is terrible or even bad. Its quite adequate, actually. The animation, as with all of the movies with their much higher production budget, is absolutely beautiful and fluid, far more so than the typical episode of the anime. The voice acting (I watched the dub because thats what I prefer) is just fine, and no better or worse than the show. Each of the voices fit the characters well and the actors do just as well. So there are no real problems with the acting, animation, or overall production of this anime film; they're all just fine. The problems with this film all stem from its clichd narrative. The plot and new characters take absolutely no risks or deviation from standard action anime films in this genre. In fact, in many respects, these Naruto films have formed tropes unique unto themselves.
 The film starts off with a false shocker ending, in-media-res. I could instantly tell its a red herring because of the title, so I wasn't really fazed by it. We are then quickly introduced to our tragic, tsundere, damsel-in-distress heroine for the evening, the priestess Shion. Immediately noticeable is that her character design, if not characterization, is strikingly similar to Hinata Hyugas in Shippuden. Its so obvious and jarring, its actually kind of odd that none of the other characters mention it, not even Neji. Shes voiced in the dub by veteran Laura Bailey, who does quite well as portraying her snobbishness as well as her sadness and compassion. Shes not too terribly complex however, as her backstory of fate and sacrifice and all that jazz has not only been done a million times in anime and fiction in the past, but also in just this series. In fact, much of her attitude and eventual character arc strongly echoes that of the heroine from the first Naruto movie, Yukie Fujikaze from Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow. She just seems to be a conglomeration of previous characters and arcs, with not much else to her as a character. Unfortunately, much of the rest of this film plays out in the same fashion.
 The plot is so standard, it practically can be called note by note. Shion is the only daughter of the former priestess, and is the only person who can seal the ancient evil known as Sauron Moryo, whom was defeated by her mother at the cost of her own life. A group of evil ninja whose names are inconsequential as they're just there as cannon fodder for the heroes to curb stomp in the third act revive the spirit of Moryo and his unstoppable army of mindless Orcs Terracotta Warriors. They plan to use Moryos power to take over the world. Naruto and his team are assigned to escort Shion to the Land of Mordor Swamps where she can seal Moryos body forever. Yukie Shion is at first a spoiled brat and a firm believer in predetermined fate like Neji, and is content to be sacrificed for the good of her people. Naruto eventually wins her over with his ninja way and unflinching determination, and she falls for him. He eventually destroys the evil Moryo, who it turns out is some kind of eternal Cthulu demon without a clear origin, with his Rasengan combined with the special flavor of the day chakra from Shion, and the movie just kind of stops as the credits roll. An after credits scene once again showcases Narutos stupidity and naivet, and were done.
 As you can see, this film hits not only tons of action and anime clichs, but also tons of tropes from just the Naruto anime and the other theatrical films. The plot flows in such a familiar and predictable fashion, that your predictions for what will happen next will be better than Shions. Yes, the story and characters are overused to the point of tiredness, except when it ups the weirdness factor to eleven and comes right the heck out of nowhere. Shions ability to predict the future isn't really explained very well, nor do we come to fully understand its rules or origins. Moryo himself is an enigma, as we don't where he/it came from or why it wants to destroy the world; hes just evil I guess. His minions that awaken him are similarly given no backstory or reason for their actions, so they're just evil bad guys too. Heck, I cant even remotely remember their names, if they even had any. At some point, there is what I surmise is some sort of Transformation Jutsu thats permanent, used by one of Shions male vassals to impersonate her, which makes it kind of a magic sex-change-no-jutsu. You explain that one. Its just odd that thats a thing in this world. The climax with Moryo is ridiculously confusing. Something about Shion sacrificing herself, possibly going back in time to undo Narutos death, or something. It all goes by so fast and without enough explanation to make sense of it; in the end, Im not really sure what happened. Also, Naruto himself seems a touch more annoying that usual, and not in a well-done manner. And one of the voice actors is Wil Wheaton. Yes, THAT Wil Wheaton. Hes not bad, but thats downright bizarre.
 In the end, its not outright terrible, but it is overly predictable. The new characters are reused cutouts, and the established characters are underutilized and fail to compensate. Shion is interesting enough of a character that I wish I could see more of her in future projects in the series, which of course won't happen because shes one-note filler fodder. Honestly, I wouldnt say this film is a necessary watch for this series; nothing is lost to the mythos by skipping it. Of course, if you are a fan of the show/manga and know what to expect, its a decent way to kill and hour and a half.",1429660800,,6141,4.5438121047877145

3298963,4,B0011D6FH2,"The rating I gave was a 4. This movie was fun to watch. Naruto continues to show people in his own gentle way that they can overcome the obstacles in their lives. In this case, its the young priestess, who has a similiar problem that Neji once had( Those who watched the Naruto series will know what I'm talking about) She feels that she can't change her destiny.

Naruto's friends Neji, Sakura and Rock Lee tag along for this adventure. Rock Lee' shows off his ""Drunken Fist"" in this one! This movie was fun and I do recommend it to everyone.",1363651200,,543,4.376237623762377

There are pro specil effcts that is really loud. They are all ninjas and of corse every body is really powerful. This means that they killed some people befor. Even the movie is so stupendous that battles could happen any time! The back round is beond cool too! The ninjas has head bands to show what team are they on. Thease are the teams lightening, mud, water, and fire.  All those teames are really powerful and stupendous too!  I give this movie five stars!

3298968,4,B0011D6FH2,I love Naruto Shippuden but I must admit I prefer the Japanese version to the English version.  The actor who plays Naruto in the English version makes him sound so angry but other than that I enjoyed the movie.,1352073600,,211,4.410256410256411

3298973,4,B0011D6FH2,"Though not my favorite so far, this movie is still all right. Naruto's efforts to protect himself from his terrible fate are vaguely annoying; as usual, the subtle humor present elsewhere in the film is much more amusing. Overall, the movie is not stellar, but it has its moments. Lee fans in particular will surely enjoy his time in the spotlight, short as it is compared to his appearance in Animal Riot on Crescent Moon Island.",1316044800,,430,4.671052631578948

3298975,5,B0011D6FH2,"I thought that this movie was awesome! A great movie to start off the Shippuden Series. The batte scenes are impressive, especially Lee's! I love the fact that Shion, the priestess would predict Naruto's death. But the only way to escape her fatal prediction, is to abandon Shion. But that's not the type of thing Naruto would do. I also love how it swears in it, and theres blood. But you don't really see much of that in this movie. But, other then that, this movie is really good. I watch it atleast twice a week, possibly more. I would recommend this to all Naruto Fans out there!",1284940800,,584,4.416666666666667
3298976,4,B0011D6FH2,"Nice to see other ninjas fight!

Neji and Lee have been getting the shaft on screen time.

It's about naruto helping this girl {i forgot her name} but she recently had a vision if Naruto was going to live... or die during their mission.

I find the short episode series much more engaging, thrilling, and entertaining though.  The movies seem to drag a bit too long for me, without enough 'thrills at every corner' to keep me on the edge of my seat.  I'd recommend the movie for Naruto fans, but of course if you are a fan then you will see it regardless of what I say!",1265155200,2,427,4.182926829268292

The characters just kind of complained back and forth to each other, the action wasn't that great, with the exception of rock lee's fight scene in it, which was pretty cool. I think i expected eveyone to have the 1 on 1 action scene the show use to have when they were younger, but overall the movie was just ok.",1260748800,3,423,4.222222222222222
3298981,3,B0011D6FH2,"The first film of the series is a good offering considering that it technically constitutes as filler, but to tell you the truth, filler with a good production value is alright for me as a casual fan.  Though it doesn't advance the main story much, actually it's a bit difficult to try and place this story within the series, but it is soon forgiven for the action is awesome (especially good if you're a fan of Rock Lee)and it heightens the devices the series tends to use sparingly (CGI effects).

  I won't trouble you by spoiling the story, it's bland and easily understood, aaaaaaaand the execution of the story is one that you've seen before in many other Naruto movies.  In fact, if anyone can tell me a Naruto movie that advances the main story, please let me know, I haven't seen them all and I'm starting to see an awkward pattern that could turn me off to the movies, but my fandom menace won't let me stop buying them.

  All in all, for those of you who are buying the volumes individually, treat this as an optional supplement to tide you over until the next volume is released.  For those of you who are still waiting patiently to get your first hit of Shippuden in full in January, then you won't even notice this movie and probably buy it for kicks.  For those of you who like to watch Rock Lee do his thing again (including his drunken fist) then cop this in full confidence.

  The villains in this movie are creative, but that's a bar that the series set for itself and at this point we expect no less, so really it's nothing truly outstanding from the series' standards.  The CGI used in this is considerable but does skim the boundary of gratuitous (sure it saves money, but do we really NEED it? it doesn't necessarily communicate with the animated characters well, but this movie manages to keep you from saying anything negative about it while it's going)

  So all I have to say is that I wasn't disappointed in buying this, I got action at a time length comparable to a volume of the series and I got to see my favorite characters from the Naruto universe thwart yet another threat to the world...but as long as the regions that encompass the Naruto main story are left untouched, then I wouldn't mind seeing the rest of the world plunge into an oblivion of weaponized chakra...",1259625600,,2305,4.476076555023924
3298982,2,B0011D6FH2,Yea this movie is alright not worth buying tho in the whole movie there is only one good fight seen between rock lee and some guy that uses earth and fire justu,1258588800,3,160,4.03125
3298983,5,B0011D6FH2,"Naruto: Shippuden- The Movie is a great experience and first entry for a movie set in the Shippuden storyline period.  The movie does a great job at capitilizing upon the fact that Naruto just returned to the Hidden Leaf Village and has not gone out on many missions nor has he seen everyone just yet.  In fact in this movie when he teams up with Neji, Lee, and Sakura, the writers make it appear that this is Naruto's first time encountering Neji and Lee since his arrival.  Generally speaking, the movie focuses on this team's mission of protecting a very important person and leading her to the designated destination. With evil afoot, they must use multiple tricks in their ninja handbooks to ensure success of their mission.

I loved it, and although most of them do not use any new jutsu since the first season of Naruto (possibly Lee uses more of the gates of opening than was seen during his fight against Gaara during the Chunin exams), it is memorable to sit back and listen to the jutsu (and nearly say word for word what the character says).  I was also intrigued by the medical ninjutsu of the enemies.

The movie excels in being a great film for fans and some newcomers since it is light on the background material and easy on the narrative.  I loved the incorporation of multiple 3D effects such as 3D environments and planes/enemies.  It looked well put together and actually flowed with the 2D imagery.  Music was also on key with the Naruto Shippuden theme appearing in the usual places and some ""made for the movie"" tunes pumping us up for the events.

For the DVD, my version seemed to lack the option for subtitles, and only included the English audio, no special features, nor subtitles.  Cover art to the DVD is amazing with both the design on the disc, as well as the design of the cover.  This is definitely a must buy for Naruto fans, even with the lack of special features (seemed the only movie that VIZ has made that has had numerous features was the first Bleach Movie).",1258156800,,2000,4.540389972144847

As far as the dvd what can I say its Naruto, so it totally rocks. I like English dub, my daughter likes to watch the Japanese with subs so we are both happy with this release. And yes I gotta love the fact we get new release's early due to family that work in the right places, so enjoy this one when the rest of you get the chance.
