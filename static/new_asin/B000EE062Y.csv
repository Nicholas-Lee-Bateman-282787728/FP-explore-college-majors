8108654,5,B000EE062Y,fantastic.  very informative.  a must for any eastern style archer who wishes to understand his equipment better.,1435968000,,113,5.588235294117647
8108655,3,B000EE062Y,Looks to have been made in the back woods of NC. Interesting video none the less. It's worth about $5,1378944000,,101,4.1
8108656,3,B000EE062Y,"Hmm, where to start... ok.. I'm brand new to this study so here's a newbies review.

Pros:
1. I now know about the marterials that are used to construct a composite bow.
2. I now (mostly) understand the principles about contructing the bow.
3. The guys that made the video know what they're talking about

Cons:
1. Bad video quality.
2. How do you construct the bow string?
3. No close up on applying the sinew (very basic explanations as well)
4. They made the video in a hurry (this was stated in the video multiple times) I am not in a hurry, I want to learn.

I wish I could interact with the video and actually have been there during the process, I believe I would learn a lot more that way. If the video showed close up footage of applying the sinew I'd be satisfied. I also have a lot of unanswered questions regaurding bow stings. I believe I would have confidence in constructing a bow by myself if they would have focused on explaining how to construct a basic composite bow instead of a recurve, doing that might have gave them more time to get the basics across because they were in a hurry. I really hope these guys put together another video because they obviously know what they're doing. I just think they need a professional to help them layout the video format in order to optimize the information output and perfect the videos quality. I learned a lot but deffinately not enough, I will be searching for more information on the subject before apply the knowledge.",1242604800,4,1482,4.461254612546125
8108657,2,B000EE062Y,"If you buy this video intending, by the end of it, to have the tools that you need in order to construct an asiatic composite bow you should probably look elsewhere. The video (visual apsect) is not of a particularly high quality. Edits are rough; it appears to have been filmed on a hi-8 camcorder. Camera angles are not always chosen with the research-minded viewer in mind. There were many times when I wished that I had a more useful view of the subject. Audio is patchy.

As far as content is concerned, anyone who has ventured far enough into the world of traditional archery to consider making an asiatic composite bow probably has a grip on most of the material presented. It does provide a visual for some of the processes described in the canon ( i.e. Paul E. Klopsteg's ""Turkish Archery..."" and ""Saracen Archery"" ), but is still quite reticent about critical parts of the formula such as dimensions, materials, and glue/water ratios. Also, of the composite bows, a Turkish-style is probably the most technically difficult and time-consuming permutation to build- not a very reasonable choice for the beginner. For example, do keep in mind that grooving the surfaces of the core was only historically done in the highest-performance bows and greatly complicates the building process. I digress.

:::HOWEVER:::

I By no means mean to degrade the bows themselves. I have heard nothing but praise with respect to Jeff's bows, both from archers and other composite bowyers alike. My suggestion to the aspiring composite bowyer is, however, to beg, borrow, steal, or make an investment in the classic texts pertaining to the subject and then, if necessary, use the film to fill in some of the blanks.",1164672000,,1705,4.892733564013841
8108658,5,B000EE062Y,"Two hours of detailed explanations. The authors explain all you need to have your job done. Than it comes the difficoult part, put it in practice, but this video is really a help in making things easier. They start from the preparation of the horns, wood and sinew, with useful tools you would never think of using. Than the whole process is explained. Really a must for those of us who cannot find the book of Klopseg and have not access to a teacher, but are willing to make this fascinating bow.",980467200,7,498,4.423913043478261
