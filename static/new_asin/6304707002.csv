Showing the exploits of a Communist mother and her suspecting son this movie is not only a commentary on COmmunism and the excess of liberalism but it is also a hilarious film with an amazing funny cast and a profound group of intrigue.  The main character is followed through his life as he slowly realizes he is none other then the son of Stalin, the man his mother loves but who he learns to loathe.  Yet as time goes on the viewer is led to wonder: Maybe in his rejection of his father he actually becomes him.  Funny, great. Wonderful!!!!",1074729600,4,613,4.5963302752293576
914320,5,6304707002,"This is an extremely original and well made farce. the film is generally comical but there are some tragic overtones throughout. The story of the idealist leader of the Australian communists earns a trip to meet Stalin in Moscow. The visit provides the setting for some of the funniest moments in the film. The idea of Stalin dancing and singing is funny in itself, imagine watching it realized on screen.  But this comical interlude provides the crucial elemnt of the plot, the conception of Stalin's son.  His identity is kept secret by his mother, but through a series of fortuitous circumstances Joe (thta's his name palyed by Roxburgh) becomes a union leader and organizes the police force. Hints are given throughout his childhood, he loves handcuffs for instance - leading to a steamy scene with a seduced policewoman. as a result of an 'accident' he has to grow a moustache and discovers his true personality after this event.  There is sadness also, but I felt it beyond the plot or film itself.  The mockery is certainly funny but it's undeniable that many idealists were betrayed by Stalin and his unbound evil.  Communism in the Soviet union (and elsewhere) might have developed differently had Stalin not hijacked it.  Now we're left with no alternatives and embarking on a dangerous course of increasing inequality.  The film ironizes and does an excellent job (Judy Davis' excellent acting apart) of showing the demoralization of an idealist who has to face the sad reality and the poor 'loves' of the past.  I saw the film twice and remember it with an ironic smile. Highly recommended",1010620800,13,1601,4.9037037037037035
914321,4,6304707002,"A real find. The film starts out as a broad satire (perhaps just a bit too broad), then sharpens to a steely point in the second half. Judy Davis has never been more ferocious (and that's really saying something). A romp, but  one that leaves bruises. Grab it.",964051200,6,260,4.416666666666667
914322,4,6304707002,"Children of the Revolution features a host of great actors -- Judy Davis, F. Murray Abraham, Sam Neill, Richard Roxburgh -- and two extremely moving low-key performances by Geoffrey Rush and Rachel Griffiths.  Just that cast  alone can sustain a hell of a lot, and Children of the Revolution isn't shy  about pitting them against one another.
The beginning and middle of the  movie are deft blends of socio-political satire and personal drama,  laughter and emotion.  It's too bad that in the second half of Act 2 it  takes a turn for melodrama.  Given the calibre of the acting, it works  (Griffiths plays especially nicely against Davis, and Rush -- his character  increasingly isolated in the story -- is bewitching), but I wish there  could've been more of a mix of the comic and the tragic near the end of the  movie.  The comedy wasn't so much forgotten (the ""Ronald  McDonald"" bit, and the last interview with ""Joe Welch"" still  hit the funny bone) as underweighted in the final parts of the story.  The  film deserves credit, nonetheless, for even aiming towards this complicated  mix in the first place and succeeding 90% of the time.  And the setups and  subplots are brilliant -- Anna's Latvian background weaving into the  Dave-Joan relationship; Welch's jealousy of Stalin; Joe's eventual  megalomania; the cellmate and future assassin; even the final hilarious  reveal about Anna and Dave was set up.
A small but bright gem, not easy  to discover (the eye-popping video cover helped), but well worth the hunt.",952214400,7,1523,4.905511811023622
914323,5,6304707002,"I felt this movie is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life. As a Communist, I first assumed the movie was just a farce of stalinist Russia. Throughout the first 30 minutes, I laughed a lot. I thought the  notion of some-one as evil as Stalin singing and dancing is funny, to me. I  really felt with the main charrecter and her ideology, except her love of  Stalin, and was happy that she finally realises he was evil. At the end,  the Son (concieved by Stalin) turns into his father, and proclaims that he  is doing the work of the Revolution. It gives a good example of Stalin's  acts and how they ruined Lenin's Russia.
Children of the Revolution is a  brilliant film, and Leninists and true Communists can plainly see this.",943488000,15,738,4.343065693430657
914324,4,6304707002,"Not necessarily a bad thing to be different. I cannot quite grasp what this movie is trying to be, but I liked it okay. The humor is often dark, and I feel I have missed some of it. I did laugh at times, but not enough  for me to call it a comedy. I did find it a bit philosophical, but not  terribly deep, so I wouldn't call it a thought-provoking film. It's  definitely not action, and it's not art-house... so what is it? That is a  question I cannot answer, but... it doesn't matter! The film has some good  stuff, and I did enjoy it. The plot twist at the end was completely  unforseen, and caught me by surprise! That alone makes it worth viewing!  So, my review is this: I liked it, but it would not be one of my favorites.  It's just a movie with some interesting aspects.",927072000,2,780,4.119205298013245

7876113,4,6304707002,"Many years hence many people will surely remember the many outstanding (Australian, in this case) actors and a handful of movies that are rarely mentioned, but plainly savored, if available. For the older cinephile who's seen hundreds of flicks, it is a rare treat to stumble across something different, yet refreshing. Judy Davis is one of those whose intensity and passion for a role are to be cherished with every word and every sigh. It is equally rare to see characters age before your eyes believably - too often special effects and make-up want to take over the screen. Not here. This is a wrenching tragic comedy that doesn't quite catch fire, as some have said, but which is to be relished for the audacity of its premise and seriousness of purpose. Can't quite compare this to The Breakfast Club, and yet we should for the spirit that provides originality and true drama to the genre it springs from is laudable. Somehow the movie slides down from a serious farce into a comic tragedy and Sam Neill's wit in particular seems diffused (or maybe defused), although his role is fairly prominent. But any movie that will send you online in desperate search of historical truth has done its job - it entertained you. The only other question you want to ask yourself in judging whether a movie is a classic is whether you'd like to see it, again. I did (see it many years ago on VHS and enjoyed it again, on DVD). I don't always. If you haven't got the taste of Judy Davis yet, try Impromptu or My Brilliant Career and yes, even The Ref, three other gems you will want to view ever so often as reminders of great modest filmmaking. Geoffrey Rush and F. Murray Abraham are here, too, but Judy steals the show.

One unfortunate comment I must make is that the sound seems muffled and needs to be cranked up and a couple of brief, but graphic intimate scenes and loose words (integral to plot and dialogue) keep this on a firm R-rating, which would otherwise have been decent fare even for the younger set. A ""cleaned-up"" broadcast version would be great, but unlikely, considering the intellectual depth of the film and shallowness of the general audience. A ""making of"" featurette would also have been really nice - perhaps on a future Blu-ray release.",1338595200,,2255,4.6375

A blindly idealistic Australian Communist believes so fervently in the Revolution that she writes weekly love letters to Joseph Stalin, conceives his child (or so she believes), and raises a son in the tradition of iron-fisted tyranny.

7876116,3,6304707002,"1996 Australian black comedy Children of the Revolution is one of those ideas that sounds better on paper than it plays on screen. It's the Cold War and Judy Davis is a hardline doctrinaire Communist oblivious to sad sack boyfriend Geoffrey Rush's attempts to win her hand because her heart belongs to Josef Stalin. When the dictator gets to see her letters - and more importantly her photo - he invites her to Moscow where a night of passion leaves him dead and her pregnant. Marrying Rush and raising the boy with her ideals (and a thing for getting arrested), he grows up to threaten a real revolution from within the system when he unionises both the Prison Service and the Police, but, as his mounting paranoia about his parentage as his office and his physique slowly merge into mirror images of Stalin, it's not quite the revolution she had in mind...

Boasting a good cast and Richard Roxburgh, who is surprisingly adequate for a change, it never really catches fire. The tone is never quite right, leaving some of the best ideas high and dry while too many moments like Beria and Kruschev providing backing vocals for F. Murray Abraham's Stalin's rendition of I Get a Kick Out of You show the actors struggling with scenes that they all-too-clearly know just aren't working. Even Sam Neill occasionally seems unsure of how far to go or hold back as a treble agent of no particular loyalty who may or may not be young Joe's real father but certainly is the one who killed Joe's wife's parents (and their entire village) on Stalin's orders. On the plus side it does offer a role that perfectly suits Judy Davis' traditionally unsympathetic one-note anger for once, though it's Geoffrey Rush who impresses the most, managing to create a character who is both funny and believably human amid the stereotypes. Nice try, but no cigar.",1202515200,,1837,4.722741433021807
