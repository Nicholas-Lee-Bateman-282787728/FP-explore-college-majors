8307876,1,B001H5X6U8,This movie is horrible. Once again I thought because it has an actor that I like (Tusshar) I thought it was going to be good. Nope! Waste of my money.,1365724800,,150,4.033333333333333
8307877,4,B001H5X6U8,"Once you get past the opening song that sounds like the Chipmunks singing with Indians in Star Trek costumes, the movie is really funny. Don't stop at the first song, keep watching.

There are three ""losers."" One has a job his wife hates, one has a son who is using him, and one does an Indian version of ""America's Most Wanted"" but really is a coward. They are buddies. The Dad gets one of the friends to call and threaten his son for money (which he wants back from his son.) All want money for different reasons, to marry and change jobs are the other two reasons. One call leads to another and soon they are an ""underworld gang"" called C KKompany. They become famous and even featured on the one guy's show. Of course, the police and another real underworld gang are trying to find out who they are. I'm not saying more so I don't ruin the movie.

There were only 5 songs in this Bollywood and none of them very memorable. They also are big into blonds doing the Bollywood songs and dancing, rather odd there. Don't get this film for singing and dancing Bollywood style. You'll be disappointed. However it is much funnier than most Bollywood films. There are English subtitles.",1258502400,,1181,4.488372093023256
