8080045,4,B000AXFSW2,I loved it. Worth the money too. I only wished the words were on screen whilst the speakers were talking. I wished tones and finals were addressed too.,1423353600,,151,4.428571428571429

I was charged for this.",1379894400,,103,3.5217391304347827
8080048,5,B000AXFSW2,"I especially like how each phrase is pronounced by two different people, alternating a slow enunciation and then a normal talking speed so you get a sense of acceptable variation of pronouncing.  Practical travel and business phrases, and the DVD includes a small paper printout of the phrases in English Mandarin and characters, so if worse comes to worse, you can show the characters!",1358899200,,386,5.03125
8080049,3,B000AXFSW2,"I bought this for my wife, who's a native American trying to learn Mandarin. I won't comment on the content in the DVD because I'm not a linguistic nor any kind of expert in related field (I speak 4 different language though). However, my wife and I feel strongly about the way it presents the content is not something you'd like to see again and again, however that's the way you learn a language by exposing yourself in that language and repeating it.

First of all, the sound recording quality is below standard, which is not good for something you want to hear again and again. And then they really didn't make the speakers look OK on camera. I'm not saying they should pick super models or hot idols for a language learning DVD, but at least clean their face and comb the hair; some basic makeup to cover those things on skin that you don't want to see when eating dinner.

I wish this DVD is something I could use on a daily base, but me and my wife decided not to open it anymore after our first trial. We did try to watch it for 20 minutes even though in the first 10 minutes we already wanted to stop, but in the end we still couldn't stand it.

Again I'm not commenting about the content, it's not something great anyway. If you don't mind those things I mentioned above, feel free to try it and you will know what I mean.",1345852800,,1332,4.256916996047431
8080050,4,B000AXFSW2,"This is a video upgrade from the old cassettes where you hear the English phrase once and the phrase in your new language once or twice. The video update does, however, make the language a little more alive. And there's a handy little card to study from. However, it's worth remembering that there's no such thing as a silver bullet for language learning. If you keep watching this till you're tired of it - and you can take 7 or 8 viewings - you'll have a useful stock of phrases for everyday situations. Used in combination with a couple other similar systems like In Flight from Living Language, the Rapid System from Earworms or (best) a Pimsleur intro, this will help you build the barest survival Mandarin for a short trip.",1178755200,5,729,4.572519083969466
8080051,4,B000AXFSW2,"This DVD would be better if it included a brief discussion of the four tones of Mandarin Chinese.  At the very least, the pinyin spellings ought to be marked to indicate which tone is used.  Even the phrase list included with the DVD lacks the tone symbols.  Considering their importance, it would have required minimal extra effort to include them.

In any case, each phrase in English has two Chinese translations: one in characters and the other in pinyin (without tones).  This is a good product for learning some basic words & phrases in a short amount of time.",1168819200,13,566,4.6767676767676765
8080052,5,B000AXFSW2,"I'm taking a beginning conversational Chinese class at a community college. This DVD covers much of the same material, and is an excellent supplement to the course. While studying during the week between classes, it's easy to forget the precise pronumciation of new words -- you can end up practicing the wrong pronunciation all week!

As with any foreign language, it would be quite challenging to start out learning it by yourself, using a DVD like this without taking a class or having a tutor or mentor of some kind. But as a supplement to a formal course, this DVD is invaluable.

Of course, if you're going to China and don't have a semester to study the language, you'll be a lot better off having studied from this DVD.

What I particularly like about this DVD is that it has video. You can see the speakers' faces quite cleearly. And there's more than one speaker repeating the same word, so you can really get it. This is so much more helpful than just an audio version.

In my opinion, this is a quality product, and a bargain to boot.",1142380800,18,1046,4.518518518518518
8080053,5,B000AXFSW2,"This dvd is great!  Not only do the two instructors speak the words/sentences both slowly then normally, but the anglicized words are shown on the screen.  The sentences are very basic and should be helpful for a first-time visit to the People's Republic of China.  Seeing and hearing a dvd is much, much better than just listening to a cd while reading a book.",1140480000,13,361,4.609375
