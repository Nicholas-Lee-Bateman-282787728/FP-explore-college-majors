7933728,4,B000059HBP,"This is a very cute story/documentary about two otters that live with a family and one in particular, Tinker, who befriended the family's puppy.  The footage of the animals playing together is wonderful.  However, the story begins somewhere in the middle, and there is no background on the family or how they acquired these otters.  The film is only 25 minutes long and the editing is a little rough.  But, I have never seen a dog and an otter play together or otters playing in the snow.  Despite the fragmented quality, I would definitely recommended it!",1143072000,4,556,4.75
