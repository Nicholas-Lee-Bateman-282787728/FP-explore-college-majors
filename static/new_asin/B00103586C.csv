They made errors in some places like Lepke did not run the Garment District for Luciano ,Lepke had his own gang or they said Lucchese and Albert Anastasia were two of the four assassins who killed Maranzano . According to Joe Valachi the killers were all Jewish , thus unknown to Maranzano  . Tommy Lucchese was the underboss of an ally of Marazano , and also he was to finger (point out) Maranzano for the assassins . Well I hope Dennis Farina got paid well R.I.P. .",1466208000,,724,4.231884057971015

never knew. Especially interesting is crime in the Al Capone
era and after WW II.  I think I shall buy one for my friend in
Texas.",1360972800,,191,4.135135135135135
8236673,5,B00103586C,"I absolutely loved this documentary! There is so much information in this film that you can watch it time and time again and pick up more tidbits. There are many photos of Bugsy,Capone,Luciano as well as many others. There is plenty of live footage of court-room drama with Virginia Hill and quotes from the most famous mobsters. This is true American history dating back to the arrival of many European immigrants to Ellis Island,NY.Even the back-round music is great. Dennis Farina's narration is captivating and he is one with first-hand knowledge being an ex Chicago cop for 18 years in the 60's and 70's! I was still processing this documentary for days after viewing it. This would be an invaluable addition to any crime history enthusiast!",1210377600,5,746,4.928571428571429
