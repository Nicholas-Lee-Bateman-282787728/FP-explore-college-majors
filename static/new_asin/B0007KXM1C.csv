LADY IN WAITING still stays nowadays as one of the best episodes of the first season thanks to Susan Clark's praiseworthy performance as Beth Chadwick, the first feminine murderer encountered by Columbo during his TV career. I also appreciated the unusual 20 minutes long ""before the murder"" scenes and the fantasised murder Beth imagines before her brother's arrival. Norman Lloyd's decision to film this phantasm as if the characters were blurry and out of focus was risky but effective. Great job.
