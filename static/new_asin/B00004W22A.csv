1360261,5,B00004W22A,"If you like off beat comedies with an international flavor, you'll love this movie.  I saw it three times in one week and it kept me laughing.
Mary Ann is an American widow teaching English in Rio de Janeiro.  She rediscovers love with Pedro Paulo, a Brazilian lawyer.  Although their love story is at the center of this film, the other characters that are intertwined in the plot make BOSSA NOVA worthy of its namesake.  Like the musical genre, the movie has many layers: at the forefront, it is very sweet and simple and underneath, there is a variety of sounds and rhythms that lends it its complexity.  And when its all over, it just leaves you with a wonderful free feeling.  I especially enjoyed the comedy between Acacio, the soccer star and his sidekick/manager Gordo.  Just hearing them trying to speak words in English, the good ones and the bad ones, with their thick Brazilian accent is worth the 20 bucks.  Yet as a lover of real bossa nova, I gotta say the soundtrack is pretty weak with only modern covers of great bossa nova classics.  But all in all, this is a great film and you should buy a copy of it now because you'll definately be watching it more than once.",994636800,11,1181,4.481308411214953
1360262,5,B00004W22A,"Let me just add that I have never come out of a cinema feeling happier than when I saw Bossa Nova at the London Film Festival last summer.  As funny as 'Some Like it Hot', and more romantic.",991180800,,190,4.0
1360263,4,B00004W22A,"I can't believe that this movie came out two years ago and this is the first I have heard of it.  I was enchanted by Amy Irving when I first saw Crossing Delancey, another one of her great films; and when I came across this gem last night, I had to check it out.  She truly lives up to her talent --- as do ALL the other actors!  Half-way through watching this movie, I felt transported - to Rio!  The music envelopes you (and yes, I have already placed my order to get the soundtrack.)  Watch it - you won't be sorry!",989798400,2,518,4.03921568627451
1360264,4,B00004W22A,"The star of 'Bossa Nova' isn't Amy Irving nor Bruno Barreto (both of whom have by now become a couple, or so I've heard).  The true star, and most glorious element in this otherwise pretty movie, is the composer of the songs featured on the soundtrack: ANTONIO CARLOS JOBIM.  Without whom Brazil would still be a forgotten corner of the earth.  And Rio a half-remembered dream....  If you've never heard of him, just listen.  Elevator music on the way to heaven.",982454400,,462,4.654320987654321
1360265,5,B00004W22A,"I am a 42-year old divorcee and divorced for over fourteen years now. I am also a seasoned Marketing Executive who thought she had seen it all. However, this movie made me believe in romance and companionship again. It was one of the most enchanting movies I have seen in a long time. It was also a pleasure to see more ""mature"" actors(obviously over 30) finding someone and enjoying life. I love all types of films, old, new, drama, action, subtitled, documentaries, you name it. I purchase& rent lots of videos weekly. I am an African-American female, who has always had an interest in Latin, Afro-Cuban & Brazilian music. Brazilian music, (Jobim)in particular, is very relaxing and tranquil. I had seen a film preview of the Amy Irving film and purchased the CD soundtrack. I played it in the car, at work, at home, even let it lull me to sleep at night. Then I found the video for rental. The mature actor with the beautiful gray hair, who feel in love with Amy, was absolutely wonderful. He was so inviting and believable. One of the most tender moments in the film was the time he spent with his father, when he selected and cut the fabric for Amy's blouse.  Many Americans shy away from subtitled films, and have no patience with them.  But, Americans need to take the time to watch more international film work. I have a much greater appreciation for other cultures, outside the US,  because of the time spent watching foreign films. In fact, the English words are just a small part of it. I find I am more observant and watch the actors much more intently. Facial expressions and mannerisms mean so much more, because the abbreviated words don't say enough.  There are not enough words to say how much this film has impacted my life.  Who has not thought about running off to Rio, and floating in the warm, salty sea at dawn.........Thank you Amy!",978912000,25,1856,4.595166163141994

1360267,5,B00004W22A,"This movie was a bit of terrific.
I enjoyed the point of view shots of Rio that reminded me that Rio is one of the most beautiful cities on earth.
The love stories were woven together not unlike a good episode of ""The Love Boat"". And the characters while not quite 3D, were certainly 2 dimensional.
The music lilts pleasantly in the bg.
Suffice it to say that you could do much worse than ""Bossa Nova"".

This movie brings us back to the romance and beauty of  Rio - this is important because the two sides do coexist. Well acted, sweet, a little silly at times, but also hilarious  for those familiar with the idionsyncracies of the cariocas  (residents of Rio).

1360272,3,B00004W22A,"I like watching foreign films. Its interesting to see how other people live, think, breathe, laugh, behave, etc. I ordered Bossa Nova for this reason, and Amy Irving (great actress) is one driving factor. I was disappointed in this movie. Whats wrong with Amy Irving, she delivers her lines like a Stepford wife: robotic and monotone, with the same facial expression all throughout the movie. Some actors are miscast: that famous (plain looking and older) soccer player. Couldnt they have gotten a younger, more handsome (and believable) one? Someone who looks like Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Kak? The ending is so predictable. But then this is a romantic comedy. Some characters and scenes are actually funny, though. I like Nadines character here, especially the part where she was at the US embassy and the US consul asked her what address in the US her Internet boyfriend lives (because she said thats where shes staying). She took out a piece of paper and showed the US consul his address (W-W-W-dot. Or something to this effect.)
Its a meh movie. I wish I could give 2.5 stars as I'm in between I don't like it and it's okay. Would not recommend to friends or they will blame me for wasting their time.",1436486400,,1208,4.784688995215311

1360310,5,B00004W22A,Delightful movie set in Brazil with English and Portuguese subtitled. The female lead is an English teacher and one of her private students is a soccer star that is moving to England and needs to know English profanity. These scenes along with some suggestive sexual content make the movie unsuitable for children. This is just a small part of the movie. This is a really fun love story with lots of comedic moments. It's one I can watch again and again.,1329868800,,454,4.617283950617284

1360312,4,B00004W22A,"I reviewed this a few years ago, but seeing it again made me want to review it again.  I really enjoyed this Bruno Barreto film, which co-stars Antonio Fagundes (famous in many Brazilian Novelas, recently Duas Caras) and Amy Irving (Barreto's ex-wife, but wife at the time of this movie.  The movie has a terrific marriage of English and Portuguese, and the Brazilian actors and actresses involved were particularly popular in Brazil and some of them have gone on to much bigger stardom as well.

I do not want to give all of the movie away, but it is abou love, lost love, tragedy, coincidence and moving forward - but with a very light approach.  A very stereotypical romantic comedy.  It focuses on an English teacher, Mary-Ann, in Brazil (Irving) and a lawyer, Pedro Paulo (Fagundes) that she meets and the coincidences in all of the different people they meet, and how they all end up knowing each-other or at the very least, being aware of one another.  Pedro Paulo has issues to deal with his ex-wife, Mary-Ann with her ex-husband and the other characters with their fears and nervousness of other challenges in the current chapters of their lives, like Acacio (Alexandre Borges), a popular futebol(soccer) player in Brazil moving on to Europe.  SPOILER ALERT: the movie does have a nice sort of twist, with the scene of Acacio heading to the Airport and Pedro Paulo & Mary Ann at the airport - that airport being the Antonio Carlos Jobim airport in Rio.

I loved the movie.  IT was light, had great moments of comedy, and above all else, it showed Rio De Janeiro in such a positive light.  And that was very nice to me, because so many movies and documentaries of Brazil focus on the negatives so it was refreshing to see some of the real beauty which gives some people a fascination with the country.  Beautiful scenery is there to see, and while not completely realistic, I enjoyed the break.  Also, I liked the character of Sharon, the strong-willed intern played by Giovanna Antonelli (Tres Irmaos, etc.), highlights a young ambitious carioca personality very well.  Fagundes, Antonelli, Borges and especially Pedro Cardoso are very established actors and actresses in Brazil, featuring on loads of soap operas there.

If you're looking for a fun, nice, light-hearted movie (in subtitles if you do not speak Portuguese or English), you should see this one.  Also, the soundtrack is equally as nice with original bossa nova compositions by Jobim, Elis Regina and new takes from Barbara Mendes and Djavan to name but a few.  If only they'd released a score...",1243209600,4,2569,4.804545454545455
1360313,5,B00004W22A,"Hey folks, if you're having a bad day or feeling a bit low this film is the PERFECT pick me up! Sweet, endearing and fun it is. The scenery is beautiful, the women so lovely, who could ask for anything more!!! I personally would have had a hard time choosing been the women. Mary Ann (Amy Irving) and Tania are both lovely women and would have tried like heck to keep them both. Tania has that sexy, intelligent look I love so much in Brazilian women. And Mary Ann is pretty, sweet and charming. Anyway, if you love Brazil (I do), Bossa Nova music and beautiful sunsets, check this movie out. A sweeter ""grape"" you will never pick!",1232323200,,631,4.3559322033898304

1360316,5,B00004W22A,"I have read several reviews on this movie and frankly I think some of these people should get over themselves!  This was a charming, funny and thoroughly watchable movie that takes you away from your everyday life and immerses you in the wonder that is love and Rio de Janeiro.  Many people have issues with the fact that this movie shows a fairytale Rio without favelas and crime - how many movies do you see of Paris without dog poo and rudeness or London without drizzle or New York without crime - many!  This is a romantic comedy and serves Rio and its actors beautifully.  As someone who loves Rio in all its aspects, I was happy to see a positive side of Brazilian life rather than a gritty, depressing 'real life' scenario.  Yes, favelas a real but there are millions of people in Rio who don't live in them!  We see enough of the sad side of Brazilian life, every so often it is good to show the positives.  Relax, take off your reality meter and wallow in the gorgeousness that is Rio, Antonio Fagundes and this sweet and funny story.",1149120000,6,1044,4.40625
1360317,4,B00004W22A,"This was a film that was in Theaters for about two minutes and then found its way to VHS/DVD. Finally. It is truly an under-rated romantic comedy that I have found (because I seem to make everyone I know watch this) to appeal to many different people of many different ages. It isn't the most original film in the world but it is well-made. Aspects of the story are like a screw-ball comedy from the thirties and other times it is a little melancholy with the right touch of longing and it addresses that oh so universal theme of trying to find that 'someone'.

It is just a simple story of two lonely people trying to meet and each time there are distractions of other people trying to meet as well and facing dreary sides of potential love.

The soundtrack matches many of the moments of film perfectly; right down to the lyrics being sung in particular scene where two of the characters meet at the most inopportune moment.

It is obvious to see why the director dedicated the film to Antonio Carlos ""Tom"" Jobim and Francois Truffaut. The inspirations from both artists are apparent and it seems like this is a Valentine to both the men and to the director's wife (the lead character) Amy Irving.

This is a film that isn't going to bring out any new surprises or insights into the human psyche. It is a small little snap-shot of a lovely moment.

""Bossa Nova"" is like the genre of music. Swingy, breezy, casual, sensual and delightful.",1102464000,8,1439,4.519230769230769
1360328,4,B00004W22A,"When I was younger, I used to wonder: how come Brazilian soap operas are so popular and Brazilian movies are considered poor? Even the so-called ""good"" Brazilian movies weren't appealing enough to Brazilian audiences. The answer may be that ""good"" Brazilian movies usually favor the background over the plot. They try to find a style of their own by making prominent use of elements of Brazilian culture, but the plot itself becomes secondary and, more often than not, boring.
That's where ""Bossa Nova"" succeeds: it is a simple, lightweight romantic comedy that would not be out of place in Brazilian television. The success of this movie in Brazil far exceeded everyone's expectations.  Instead of blatantly displaying Brazilian landscapes and typical characters, director Bruno Barreto simply used the beauty of Rio de Janeiro as a backdrop for a story that could have happened anywhere. And yet, the magic of Rio permeates this movie in a soothing, insidious way. As Bruno says in the commentary track, he chose to portray Rio as he wished the city still were, with no violence and poverty. Interestingly, not only does Bruno speak English through the whole commentary (since he's talking to his wife Amy Irving), but he even says his own name with an American accent! Talk about fully absorbing a foreign culture!
In a word, this is the kind of Brazilian movie I used to dream of when I was a teenager: just a simple and catchy story with strong enough appeal both for Brazilian and foreign audiences.",1078963200,5,1505,4.925196850393701
1360329,4,B00004W22A,"Maybe it's not the ""real"" Rio, but it's certainly the one tourists with American dollars are interested in, and so that works for me! I thought this was a good film. It reminded me of the Stanley Donen film, ""Charade"" with Antonio Fagundes a Brazilian Cary Grant, and while Amy is no Audrey, their chemistry was superb. The young soccer star's character was hilarious. Cinematography is vibrant, like that in the movie ""Frida"". The music is out-of-this-world. The whole thing is like a delicious meal with yellow corn tortillas, red tomatoes green chilies on a blue stoneware plate: visually and physically satisfying. Closed captioning doesn't get in the way for a change; in fact, there are passages where CC and subtitling work together well, because the languages interchange frequently. Students of Portuguese like me who are not used to hearing the spoken language will learn a lot from this movie.
A major annoyance: during the audio commentary by husband and wife Amy Irving and Bruno Barreto, the movie's audio track goes out of sync with the video track. This irritated me a lot, and this quality glitch loses it a star. The main movie track was fine.
Look for young Max Spielberg and his brother Gabriel Barreto for a cameo. In the meantime, I'm going to see if Amazon.com has this soundtrack!",1076371200,7,1304,4.878378378378378
1360330,4,B00004W22A,"Overall, I thought this was a great movie. There were a few moments that were trying too hard for laughs, however the story plot, the acting, and the scenery were all wonderful. I especially thought the scenery was exceptional! If not for  the story, I think it is still worthwhile to check out this movie to see Rio at its best! However I do agree with one other reviewer that this movie does give the deceiving impression that everybody in Rio, particularly middle to upper-middle class people, live in apartments in prime locations with spectacular views of the ocean. There was not a trace of poverty or crime in this movie, but I think is appropriate being that this movie is supposed to be a light hearted romanic comedy instead of a ""favela"" movie.  That's why the director's commentary is kind of a nice optional feature on the DVD version. The director, having himself grown up in Rio, clearly explains that he wanted to bring the best out in Rio. Happy movie going. Tchau everybody!",1067817600,,992,4.662857142857143
1360331,1,B00004W22A,"Barreto's image of Rio is false. There are no views of any slums and it's a fairy tale. Mary Ann's apartments has the shortest wall. What the hell is that about? In the real Rio the wall would be high and the security would be better. This false Rio is made to attract non Brazilians. The story is dull and rese,ble that of any Hollywood story. A waste of great actors. For a better Barreto fil check out ""Four Days In September""",1066435200,2,429,4.2439024390243905
1360332,5,B00004W22A,"I really liked this movie!  It so very well captures Rio De Janeiro and the characters and bits and pieces of the carioca here and there.  There's great cinematography and the characters are all (well, almost all) very likeable.  What I like is that it is a positive portrayal of Rio.
The story is really about moving forward in life and keeping an open mind, and that sometimes destiny has a way of playing tricks on you - for better and for worse.  Amy Irving stars as the English teacher who struggles to let go of her husband who passed away - yet desires to be swept off of her feet.  Her wish is granted when she least expects it when Pedro Paulo, a charismatic lawyer, and her meet.  From then, you see how their lives intertwine directly and indirectly from their friends to students to associates on an adventure.  Some don't understand how a part-time teacher can live in such a nice place in Rio.  You can sort of assume that Amy Irving's character's husband has insurance, maybe had a house at one point and she was well taken care of when she sold it all to ""get away"", perhaps by moving to Brazil and teaching English.
Enjoyable movie!  You have to watch it more than once though to capture a couple of the hidden coincidences that occur.  Like the opening scene, for example.  And the coincidence between Acacio, who is labelled a ""mercenary"" by his countrymen for his decision to play in England and the foreign corporate lawyer.  And even the differences between Pedro Paulo his brother are fun to catch.  Pick this up, pop it in, think about nothing and be taken to Rio... and if you like the flow of this movie (and the bossa nova soundtrack), you'd probably also like ""Next Stop Wonderland"".",1062288000,,1711,4.516233766233766
1360333,4,B00004W22A,"This is a hilarious romantic comedy that makes you feel good. With more twists and turns, unlikely partnerships, zany but loveable characters and beautiful scenery this is a movie that delights the senses. Set amidst the the backdrop of Sugarloaf mountain the characters parade along the beautiful beaches of Rio, in outdoor cafes or office buildings with spectacular vistas. Several other people, including the editors of Amazon have given you a pretty good idea of the multiple plots but suffice to say it has a novela or soap opera like flavor. The scenarios are unlikely but who cares? You will be having so much fun laughing at the crazy goings on, the romantic interludes and the beautiful cinematography that you won't have time to nit pick. Amy Irving, former wife of Steven Speilberg  and current ""wife""(not officially married but they have child) of the director of Bossa Nova, Bruno Barreto, turns in a good performance as the widowed English teacher. Her suttle charm is perfect for the role as a reluctant romantic. The collection of actors and actresses pull off an exceptional performance for a very memorable movie. Various scenes are worth playing over and over, especially some of those where Amy Irving or her students  use a ball to be thrown back and forth in a visceral display as they shout profanities at one another in preparation for on the soccer pitch confrontations. The Brazilian soccer player  who is headed for England to play overseas is a riot with his egocentric behavior. The wild romances are as follows: a winner of the girl from Ipenema contest(not!)  and an American  artist  who lives in a loft in New York(not!) have an internet relationship and eventually meet, a lovely law intern being romanced by her bosses brother until she meets the Brazilian soccer star who was hot for the English teacher, the ex wife travel agent of the lawyer and her Chinese Tai Chee  boyfriend and the sophisticated divorced lawyer and the English  teacher. Got that? You get the point. There are other characters of note most notably the bodyguard of the soccer star who is the massive Gordo. It is a romantic farce at it's best. The music soundtrack is perfect as the soft bossa nova creates a nice counterpoint to the crazy happenings. Recommended for a light hearted look at life in beautiful Rio.",1044835200,4,2323,4.8632911392405065

The music did not disappoint nor did the beautiful scenery but as an added bonus i loved the whole thing! Each of the characters is familiar somehow, knowable, lovable in their own way and completely human! It is classified as a romantic comedy and i guess it is-plenty of great laughs!-and lots of sweet romance.  But it is also deeper, deals with disappointment, death and loss.

1360336,5,B00004W22A,"""Bossa Nova""  is the perfect marriage between American and Brazilian culture!
As a Brazilian and a Carioca ( a native of Rio ) ,  I was very pleased to see my hometown in this film  portrayed in all its natural beauty and charm - and with the marvellous, sensual and relaxing  music of Tom Jobim in the background!
The movie itself is light and funny;  the photography is splendid and the characters are so typical of Brazilian culture and reality !  -  (the ignorant soccer player celebrity ,  the elegant, worldly  Ipanema woman...,  the middle class romantic/naive internet girl....,  the charming , successful lawyer... - and the English teacher!
(As an English teacher myself living in this city , I can assure you I run into such people in my classes and social outings quite often ! )

One of the most romantic scenes is the one in the classroom where Fagundes imagines himself dancing a Broadway show with his English teacher , Amy.
 And at the very last one,  when the romantic couple goes swimming in Ipanema Beach,  the background music ( a Bossa Nova ""classic"" )-  ""It could only happen to you"" sung both in English and Portuguese is the perfect combination of the two cultures and the romance between the main characters. It makes one feel free, happy and romantic -  just like Bossa Nova itself!",1002758400,20,1309,4.646288209606987
