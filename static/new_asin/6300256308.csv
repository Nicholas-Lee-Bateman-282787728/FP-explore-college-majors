I loved this film as a young lad, and wanted to find it to see if my 2 children would enjoy it in this day and age.
The acting is okay for kids and the story gets a bit scooby doo in places, but its a great easy going film for children to watch.
It also has a very young ""Alf"" from Home and away as a bumbling baddy !
Another film of this era is Island Of Adventure made by Ebefilms - also impossible to get hold of!",1232150400,,469,3.7474747474747474
