7903373,4,6305487847,"Overall, it was actually quite a nice documentary on some of the more serious train accidents that occurred within the 20th century, with a brief background look on the history and function of trains, which have come a  long way til now.  It went in detail, with  real life survivor accounts and  computer animation to recount the accidents in detail.  However, one thing  that I had to comment was how horrible the computer effects were... they  provide little imagination to what could have happened in real life, which  is of course, much more terrifying that anyone could imagine.  There was  actually one other similar show that was broadcasted on FOX a while ago  entitled Runaway Trains, and it went on with providing more information and  detail about each individual accident, most of which was also covered by  this collection.  All in all, this is one of the most complementary  collections that is available on the market today.... certainly worth  watching for once or twice.",964483200,4,988,4.932926829268292
