Also, the video was  released in '92 and is quite dated. Of the 3 cities, the only one I've visited is London and the video doesn't do it justice. I'm looking forward to visiting Paris but this video doesn't really make it seem all that interesting, amazingly enough! The narration is just too dry and dull. Rome was featured with more enthusiasm and is presented the best. All those beautiful fountains are just glorious! You'd do best to borrow this from your local library or buy for a really low price. But if you are seriously thinking about visiting any of the cities, I'd suggest looking for a more recent film which is what I plan to do. And do keep in mind if a movie doesn't show the London Eye (opened in 2000 I think), it is NOT going to be up to date!",1162339200,2,886,4.181286549707602
