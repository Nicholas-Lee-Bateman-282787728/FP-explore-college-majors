8752958,1,B01CFSLUGW,"This rating appliee ONLY to the current PRICING of the DVD... whuch is
ABSURDLY high!  And to the lack of its availability as a Region 1 one.
(I have a region-free player, as MOST people SHOULD... since they are
readily available from right here in Amazon for reasonable prices!  But for
those who don't yet have one, this SHOULD be easily-available as a
Region 1 DVD.)
  I saw this recently on TV, and would give this flick FIVE stars for being
interesting and well-done.  So my recommendation is simply to WAIT for
fairer pricing and your region before buying it.  As I will be doing with
respect to price. Don't encourage over-pricers by paying too much for it!
Just put in a list, meanwhile, so you won't forget it.",1494115200,2,719,4.534883720930233
