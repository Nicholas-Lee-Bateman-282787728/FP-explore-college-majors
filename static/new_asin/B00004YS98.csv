1377749,3,B00004YS98,"I can enjoy a bad movie if it is funny, creative, or at least entertaining. ""Crocodile"" is one of those movies, even if it is not very good.
Two main problems:
1) The characthers are hard to tolerate. You even root for the crocodile. Really. They are childish, obnoxious and plain stupid.
2) The movie steals from everywhere. It starts with a comparison between sex and pizza, taken from ""Threesome"". Horror scenes that seems to be taken from ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Anaconda"" and other are probably to ""honor those monster flicks"" (yeah, right).
But there are some nice scares, and the last scenes are so foolish that you have to laugh in an enjoyable way. At least the movie keeps you entertained and it even surprises you.
By the way, regarding other reviewers that complains that the movie is cheap (an usual comment on ""B-movies""), please remember that the best horror flicks (""Night of Living Dead"", ""Halloween"", ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", other) were very cheap. I am not comparing ""Crocodile"" against these classics, but it shows that is not the money and technology what counts.",979776000,7,1092,4.876344086021505

1377752,5,B00004YS98,"A group of teenagers plan a fun filled Spring Break on a house boat. One day the group stumble upon a load of crocodile eggs (most of them smashed already). Goofing around they break one and steal another. The next day they wake up and realise that the boat managed to drift away and none of them have any clue where the hell they are. That's not their only problem, for the mother(named Flat Dog) is extramly mad and wants revenge.  After reviewing Blood Surf I remembered that I hadn't reviews Crocodile, so here it is. I highly enjoyed this flick and seriously think it should of gone to the cinema so it's ten times better then a few movies that have gone to the cinema, it's got quite alot of scares, I can't count the amount of times I jumped out of my seat. The movie has some cool gore and a nice script and is helped by some likable charicters. This is a great started for all the young actors in this movie, each one of them look to be having a blast in their roles and do a superb job as well. I still can't believe I didn't get a chance to see this on the big screen it's so good. I found myself into this movie very quickly it was truly a brilliant movie, I have my DVD ordered.  I highly recommend this movie to any one of you (but there is a little bit of cheese, Croc pushing a car into the water to distroy the evadence anyone??) but who cares, it's to damn entertaining.",976752000,12,1388,4.137037037037037

The real horror is that this could happen to you. I think it was ""very loosely"" based on an attack that happened in Australia a few years back. Of course the victims in the movie are a group of very attractive young people on a houseboat.

1377819,2,B00004YS98,"What the hell?

In the ""making of"" featurette for this movie, producer Boaz Davidson (Octopus as well as the recent THE EXPENDABLES, CONAN THE BARBARIAN and DRIVE ANGRY) says a colleague had told him there was a demand for ""creature"" pictures, movies about giant killer creatures. So Davidson had the brilliant idea of making a movie about a giant crocodile. If asked ahead of time I'd have told him upfront he wasn't going to top LAKE PLACID, so don't even bother. But he didn't ask and he went ahead anyway and hired a couple of writers--Jace Anderson and Adam Gierasch (of the 2008 After Dark Horrorfest movie AUTOPSY) and Michael D. Weiss (OCTOPUS) and those writers turned in a script and Davidson offered the job of directing this thing to a horror icon, Tobe Hooper.

Now, Hooper's been responsible for some pretty important movies in the genre, namely the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and POLTERGEIST. Classics both, and no one can argue that, but . . . look, just because he came out of the gate with what is considered by many to be a masterpiece, that doesn't make him the golden child. And if anyone over the years has ever carried around the illusion that Tobe Hooper can do no wrong when it comes to horror movies, look no further than the 2000 stink-bomb CROCODILE.

Not only is this movie anything but frightening, it's barely even exciting. And the characters, holy crap! These people couldn't die off fast enough for me, I loathed almost every single one of them.

The story is pathetically simple: bunch of college kids gather at a lake where the rich one among them has a party boat. The kids plan to spend the five days of spring break partying on the water by day and sitting around the campfire drinking by night. What they didn't count on was the 20-foot crocodile, nor the eggs it had laid, nor the fact some local fishermen would find and destroy most of those eggs, except two. But that doesn't mean that, when the kids stumble upon the two remaining eggs, they should take them with them back to the boat. But that's what the geniuses do and one of them, a complete tool, decides to be an even bigger tool and stash one of the eggs in a backpack belonging to his buddy's girlfriend. Because he's cool, see.

Naturally the croc goes on a rampage and kills everything and everyone in sight, chasing the kids through the woods, destroying a general store where they've taken refuge, and taking out the local law enforcement when they try to save our young heroes.

As far as plots go, this one is about as simple as you can get.

So the least the makers of this movie could do was make us care about the characters. Nope, too much to ask for. Every single one of these people were shallow, way too impressed with themselves, and once the croc starts attacking, not even smart enough to just LEAVE. Granted, they're all somewhere lost in the woods, but even when they find the egg stashed in the backpack and realize what the croc wants, they don't think well, we'll just leave it here on the beach and take off. Instead they lie in wait, hoping to attack the beast, using the egg as bait. Dumb. They know why it's after them, leave the egg and go home. I'm glad the croc ate their friends and destroyed their party boat.

On the plus side, not all of the effects were bad. There were several kills with a badly-rendered CGI croc, but in several scenes physical effects were used, including a very impressing-looking giant croc built by Greg Nicotero's company, KNB EFX, and they're pretty much the best in the business. So at least this stinkfest had that going for it.

Unfortunately a nice-looking croc doesn't counter all the bad. Hooper's direction was sad, trying way too hard to connect with an audience that just isn't interested in his work. In fact, the people who DO give a crap about Tobe Hooper are my age and older, so a movie about arrogant teens getting killed is . . . well, when you put it like that, this movie should have been a winner. But it wasn't.

So yes to the effects, no to the direction. And no also to the acting. A couple of the actors in this movie--I'm not even going to bother naming them--had no film credits before this movie, and very few after it, and that doesn't surprise me in the least. If THIS movie is your proof you can act, that's like saying a PB&J is proof you can cook.

CROCODILE was a sad, pathetic pile of mess that nearly bored me to a sleep a couple times, and in the end only served to remind me just how seldom it is I hear the name Tobe Hooper anymore. Hmm, I wonder why that is. That's not true; after watching CROCODILE I don't wonder at all.",1342656000,,4629,4.453364817001181
1377820,4,B00004YS98,"This movie doesn't have that much originality.  It's just another one of those giant monster in the water films.  You don't really have to pay attention to it that much, and it's just made to entertain; it's clear that this is just made for those who want a non-complicated monster flick that you watch with some chips or pizza or something like that. If you like creature films that are on the SYFY channel or giant monster movies, you might like this one.  It isn't anywhere nearly as gory as PIRANHA 3D, and it isn't as good as that film either.  It also isn't as good as the original PIRANHA or ALLIGATOR, but it's still a fun film.  It has got some gore but it isn't over the top, and there's only a slight bit of nudity.  It gets very fun in the second half of the film, but I personally thought it would've been better with a higher level of gore. Once it gets into higher gear around the second half, it just becomes fast-paced fun with the creature chasing and chomping the group. The first half or so of the film, while not as fast paced as around the second half, is nevertheless quite lively and entertaining. The story involves a guy who steals an egg from a giant crocodile. This causes the monster to hunt him and his friends who are vacationing around a lake in the woods; this is basically the setting for this film, so there's some nice scenery here. However, the film does lack atmosphere even though the settings are quite nice. Even though Tobe Hooper's directing here isn't nearly as good as TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, this is still a decently directed film. There's no extreme gore, but you get to see some blood spraying with the crocodile eating people. The film moves decently in parts and is fast paced in others, and the tone of the film isn't depressing. It looks like a SYFY channel monster movie, and it's a lively film; the dark and depressing tone of some of Hooper's other films isn't here.

The menu screen for the DVD is good, and the quality of the DVD is excellent.",1338595200,,2001,4.421195652173913
1377821,4,B00004YS98,"Okay usually I don't like CGI films but this one took a bite out of me. Tobe Hooper(Director of Poltergeist and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1&2) along with F/X artists from the Tom Savini school makes this a fun romp thru the swamp. You will find the usual group of teenagers runnning afoul of one pissed off reptillian parent of a Crocodile. A B-movie that is fun and inventive despite so many other films in this Genre. I ordered this from supermart and it was delivered in no time-a few days later-and the quality of the film and the sound are great. If you like movies like Orca-the killer Whale,Jaws,and Alligator,then this is a must have for any true mother nature gone wild DVD collection. While there is one scene of CGI that will have you thinking that this Crocodile should be in the olympics there are several convincing scenes/mock-ups of this Beast that will impress you.

1377822,5,B00004YS98,this is the bloodest movie yet which is a good thing. theres blood splaters and dismembered bodies evreywhere. Also guns like shotguns and pistols trying to kill it but it did not work. And there is a lot of action like explosions and running scenes.

1377823,4,B00004YS98,"This is probably one of the best crocodile movies I have seen in a long time. It's even better than Rouge which I thought should of have much more violence especially its very realistic looking croc. This follows the story of eight teenagers who do an awesome job being...teenagers. I feel their excitement and sense of fun. But there is one really annoying character. It's the man characters girlfriend. She drove me insane with her anger and jealousy issues. The action is pretty well done here and the croc actually looks great in some scenes but in others, not so much. All in all a nice addition to the croc movie genre.",1278288000,,625,4.589285714285714
1377824,2,B00004YS98,"Crocodile (2000) There have been several movies with titles similar to this one, so be careful you don't confuse it with Alligator, Killer Crocodile, Albino Alligator, Crocodile Dundee, Alligator Eyes, or even the other Crocodile!
  This is another credit for director Tobe Hooper that adds little to his resume. A bunch of college students take a boat up a body of water (some shots suggest a river, others a big lake) where they run into an angry 20 foot long crocodile that may or may not be the living incarnation of an Egyptian god. But it is definitely mad as hell and eating everything in its path.
  The pluses here are the straightforward story and... well, that's about it. On the minus side, we have annoying unknown actors playing totally unlikable characters, a monster who seems to change size and scale depending on whether he's animatronic or computer generated, and worst of all, a movie that just stops as opposed to coming to an end. This is a definite step down for the guy who directed The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It's not even as good as Hooper's other crocodile (or alligator) movie Eaten Alive.",1229904000,,1120,4.728205128205128
1377825,2,B00004YS98,I would have given this movie at least 3 stars if it wasn't because of some obvious flaws. I'm not complaining about the CGI since its to be expected in this kind of films but flaws like the crocodile turning backwards like if it was some sort of vehicle or jumping like a dolphin makes the film a little hard to watch. Ignoring those flaws this movie was fun to watch but its going to be hard to make a lot of people watch this. Good for when you have nothing to do.,1211500800,,467,4.032258064516129
1377826,1,B00004YS98,"What was Tobe Hooper thinking?

Tobe Hooper is a talented guy and basically invented the slasher movie (""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), but he really should have taken a pass on this little project produced by Boaz Davidson (who also made the dreadful ""Spiders""). This is a simple-minded ""teenagers on spring break get eaten by a creature"" movie.

In this case the incredibly annoying teens rent a horrible houseboat and take off for a few days of partying. The teens like frolicking in the muddy water, drinking, and committing various other excesses. One night the boat drifts into a swamp, where it runs aground and is stuck. The angry 30 foot long crocodile commences stalking activities by ramming their boat (you may find yourself wishing you were watching ""Jaws"" at this point; I know I did). As an interesting survival strategy the teens escape by jumping into the water (where the crocodile is), which, though counterintuitive, was the right decision inasmuch as the crocodile literally makes the boat fall apart and sink (even though it was stuck against the ground). The true key to watching this film is the complete suspension of disbelief.

The teens go for a long walk through the woods where they adapt another survival strategy: yell constantly at each other about trivialities. Mercifully, they find a convenience store which they promptly break into, as does the crocodile. Although the number of cast members continues to fall (though not fast enough) the three survivors find rescue on the Sheriff's boat. After a giant (and totally bogus) CGI crocodile jumps and pirouettes over the boat, the teens once again decide to avoid the croc by jumping into the water with it.

The teens eventually decide on a plan to kill the croc by putting a sweatshirt over its eyes and putting sticks down its throat. Thankfully, in the execution of this plan Duncan finally gets eaten by the crocodile, thereby eliminating the most annoying cast member in recent memory. Imagine my horror when the crocodile vomited Duncan back up so he could add further insult to injury. The resolution of the movie is touching in a maternalistic way, or at least it's supposed to be. By this point I didn't care how it ended I was just grateful it was over.

This film had one of the most annoying casts and scripts I have ever sat through. I liked nobody in the cast and would have much preferred the crocodile to eat the entire cast in the first five minutes of the film so I wouldn't have to waste my time with the rest of this mess.",1211068800,3,2527,4.760273972602739
1377847,3,B00004YS98,"Since the movie's UK premier I watched it over and over again, repeatedly for days on end.

Why am I giving it three stars then? Because I recently realized almost every time I watched it, I started watching from when people began getting chomped in quick succession, which was quite a while into the movie.

Yes, it's kind of slow-paced throughout the majority of the movie.",1154476800,,375,4.666666666666667
1377848,3,B00004YS98,"CHROCACTERS

  If you can get past the Tom Cruise-alike, it's watchable.

  The unique face is great for modelling but in film it's just too distracting.

  So is the Tom Cruise-alike. No I wasn't really talking about the crocodile, but the Tomodile, who plays Brady (no relation to the Bunch). He should be called Mark McCruise, not Mark McLachlan.

  Duncan's extreme ego was somehow satisfying to me - pulling out the stops, acting over the tops. Taking Hollowood's egomania to the next level.

  And there's the rest of the Brady bunch. You know em.

REACTIONS

  After the first croc sighting, I was really surprised at the pleasant panic and chaos that went on for ages. But, of course, having thought that would mean I'd be let down the next minute.

  Where horror films fail first is reactions. They are so necessary for reality, and horror.

  Where horror films fail second is consistency.

  In the next croc bit, the first attack scene, the reactions weren't even equalled. This was the time to take it to the next level.

CROCODILE FOR A WHILE

  Mostly the CGI looks good, even - or especially  - in daylight. But all that time on modelling (I told you that croc was a model)  - CGI modelling I mean - and they just show it for flashes [..]

  Don't forget the crocorn. And jellybabies. And of course a HUGE Croke.",1138320000,,1329,4.573275862068965

1377850,5,B00004YS98,"I would like to take this moment to personally thank Mr. Tobe Hooper for creating such a brilliant masterpiece of cinema.  Move over Troll 2 and Cannibal Confederate Killers, there is a new bad boy on the block.

In this terror(able) movie, a giant ""pissed off"" croc (not sure whether it is prehistoric or not) terrorizes 8 college kids trying to ""get drunk and have a good time"" (the 2   sentences on the back of the box describe this well.)  Here is a brief description of each of these jackholes:

Brady- The popular, yet sensitive dude.

Claire- The hot girlfriend.

Duncan- The popular dude's bad-@$$ friend.

Kit- The native guy who knows his was around.

Annabelle- The native guy's girlfriend, who is obsessed with her doggy.

Sunny- The slutty girl who wants the popular guy.

Foster- The guy you don't learn anything about and don't really care when he dies.

Hubs- The drunk of the group. (I can relate)

Make sure to keep an eye out for the following scenes:

a) When hillbilly 2 feeds the chickens to 'Ole Bessie.

b) Any time hillbilly 1 opens his mouth.

c) The greatest line in motion picture history, when Kit decides to grow an extra chromosome and go, ""where's the doggy?""

d) The scene where the croc pulls a Carl Lewis high jump over the boat for relatively no reason.

e) How despite fires, explosions, crocodiles, growling sharks, volcanoes, earthquakes, sinking boats, and fire-breathing mosquitoes with rabies, the doggy, Princess, manages to survive the entire Crocodile Adventure.

f) I grow weary or this, believe me there's more.

All in all out of a possible ten, one being lowest, ten being high, and five being average, I give this flick a 9.  Thank You New Image Home Cinema; you've put a smile on my face once again.",1111536000,3,1750,4.6875
1377851,5,B00004YS98,"I know some people might think I'm nuts for rating a movie like this so high but I'm rating it according to the type of film it is -- a Grade B creature-on-the-loose flick. Anyone watching a film called ""Crocodile"" knows up front that it isn't ""Apocalypse Now."" That said, ""Crocodile"" (2000) is simply a blast.

THE STORY: A bunch of college kids go out to a scenic vacation spot on Spring Break to have some fun in the sun and encounter a giant crocodile.

To be expected in such a scenario the youths ""party"" and cuss a lot, so stay away if either offends you.

""Crocodile"" was directed by Tobe Hooper, the hallowed director of the acclaimed ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" I'm not a big fan of ""Texas"" (although I don't hate it either) and feel ""Crocodile"" is a more entertaining effort.

The film was shot on a scenic lake in Mexico, but the story takes place in the SW USA. Needless to say, fabulous locations.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There's a fake-looking CGI scene depicting the crocodile jumping over a boat that doesn't work at all, not to mention, it was highly unbelievable (of course, the WHOLE film is unbelievable, huh?). Other than that the F/X are fine for a Grade B flick; in fact, the crocodile looks great.

FINAL ANALYSIS: ""Crocodile"" is not great cinema but it's got loads of energy and is great mindless entertainment. As testimony to its entertainment value, I've watched it three times in the last few years -- it's just a fun, rewatchable creature-on-the-loose flick highlighted by some extremely cute girls, three that I can count.

For comparison, ""Crocodile"" is overall way more entertaining than 1999's ""Lake Placid.""

The film runs 93 minutes.

1377853,3,B00004YS98,"I can't say for certain whether Tobe Hooper's film ""Crocodile"" was the one to kick off the spate of low budget beastie flicks currently plaguing video store shelves. It might have been the one, though, since Hooper's activities have been known to attract copycats. Perhaps this director is simply ripping off his own work, as he was the one who made the atrocious ""Eaten Alive"" back in the late 1970s. That film involved a killer crocodile (or was it an alligator?) wreaking havoc in the bayous of Louisiana. Well, ""Crocodile"" is a much, much better film than ""Eaten Alive,"" but it isn't anything to brag about to your friends. It's sort of sad that Hooper's film career has had more downs than ups. ""Crocodile"" will probably not rescuitate his flagging career. While the movie is often fun to watch, we need to be honest with ourselves and admit that we have seen this all before. Aside from ""Eaten Alive,"" the 1970s and early 1980s saw a huge number of similarly themed films. You had alligators roaming through sewers, piranhas preying on swimmers, and sharks shutting down beaches. I'm guessing these movies have something to do with the human need to believe in civilization. By conquering whatever nature can throw at it, humanity proves its own inestimable worth and confirms its position as ruler of the earth.
Before we can believe we are truly superior, we must make the requisite number of sacrifices to nature. In the case of ""Crocodile,"" that means a bunch of college age kids heading out to a lake for a few days of summer fun. You've got Brady (Mark McLachlan), Claire (Caitlin Martin), Duncan (Chris Solari), Kit (D.W. Reiser), Annabelle (Julie Mertz), Sunny (Sommer Knight), Foster (Rhett Jordan), and Hubs (Greg Wayne) serving as the soon to be victims. The lead up to the massacre involves the mandatory relationship problems, overweening egos, and general bad behavior one expects from America's youth. For example, Claire is a nice girl just hoping to share a few precious moments with her lovebird Brady, but finds it difficult to hang out with him when his obnoxious friends show up. Too, Sunny has designs on Brady; designs that she hoped would find fulfillment on the trip before she knew Claire was coming along. Of course, Sunny and Brady have a little secret of their own that could cause serious problems for Claire. Yet, it is easy to forget such trivialities when the sun comes out, the water turns warm, and the alcohol flows like a river.
Unbeknownst to our eight happy campers, something horrible lurks in the deep waters of the lake. Two insufferable fishermen first encounter this beast when they stumble over a nest of crocodile eggs on the shoreline. Being the ecologically minded souls that they are, the two yucks start throwing the eggs around, breaking the shells while they laugh maniacally. Sadly for the fishermen the mother croc turns up at an inopportune time, making her presence known in no uncertain terms by gulping up one of the fools in a single bite. The kids, camping some distance away, here the calamity but think nothing of it at first. They do find the nest the next day, and once again humans start mucking around with the croc's potential offspring. One of the kids hides an egg in Claire's bag, much to her chagrin later. Soon after, the crocodile finally makes herself known to the youths by destroying their houseboat and chasing them overland for miles. Shrieks, the beating of chests, and the tearing of hair follow all to no avail. The beast turns out to be the size of a blimp with the ability to run at mach speeds. Our heroes and heroines begin to drop off one by one, overwhelmed by the brute force of nature run amok. To explain the presence of this creature, some bunkum story emerges that a local resident brought giant crocodiles over from Egypt years before, but the kids don't really care about that once the bloodletting begins. They just want to get away with their lives. Some will, of course, but more won't. ""Crocodile"" is so formulaic that we can guess from the get go how it will wrap up.
The general plot is rather pedestrian. The acting is, too, although it could be worse-and often is-in a film from this sub genre. The worst actor in the production has to be Sheriff Bowman (Harrison Young), the local cop who initially harasses the kids and then tries to save them. His leering, hammy performance didn't help the movie in any way. What really sets Hooper's movie apart from all the other efforts of the '70s and '80s are the special effects. Depicting an enormous crocodile with the ability to destroy civilization has to have shock and awe production values, so the filmmakers turned to CGI effects to realize their creation. A computer animated crocodile works most of the time, but occasionally looks a little cheesy. For instance, when the animal leaps over a boat sailing across the lake the effect looked like a computer animation. The techs did a better job when the crocodile attacks people. Pay attention to the scenes on the dock and on the boat. Good grief!
The ""Crocodile"" disc include a few trailers, a behind the scenes look at the special effects, interviews, and a commentary track with Tobe Hooper.  I should say that the problems with ""Crocodile"" pale in comparison with the inherent difficulties found in low budget dreck like the ""Shark Attack"" films. Here's to hoping Tobe Hooper can revitalize his flagging career; he will have to do better than this movie, but it's a step in the right direction. Give it a watch.",1086739200,12,5525,4.761209593326382

1377885,4,B00004YS98,"Tobe Hooper has given us films that are considered classics, such as POLTERGEIST and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, plus a minor gem, THE FUNHOUSE.  In CROCODILE, perhaps one of the better ""crocodile/alligator"" movies, he gives us some jolts and scares, a rather well done crocodile animatronic, but alas and alack, a gaggle of characters who become so whiny and self-serving, you want the crocodile to eat them all.  This is the scriptwriter's fault, but the actors (and that's being kind) are so untalented, they only make you want them to bite the bullet!  As always, the college kids are shown as dope-smoking, alcoholic wastes, and how can one feel sorry for Brady, when it's obvious he still has the hots for Sunny (the unbelievably bad Sommer Knight).  Mark McLaughlin, Chris Solari and Caitlin Martin are on the level with high school thespians, and the poor guy who plays Lester isn't even that far.
So why 4 stars?  For what it's supposed to do, CROCODILE succeeds; Hooper knows how to stage suspense; too bad he didn't have a better cast.",1082505600,,1043,4.837078651685394
1377886,5,B00004YS98,Most of you out there know the famous Tobe Hooper directed this. Most of his movies are now clasics and this one should be treated the same! Tobe rased the money for this film by him self and put alot of hard work into it. Don't think that you're buying a low budget film with bad actors and a crappy script because you're not. You're buying a low budget film with great acting and an awesom script! It's about a group of 6 teens on spring break being stalked by a  30 foot mother croc because they took her last egg. One by one each teen is devoured until the final three have to find a way to stop the croc before it's too late. If you are a fan of Tobe Hooper you will love it.,1067040000,8,680,3.9635036496350367
1377887,4,B00004YS98,"A group of college students set out for a spring break vacation on a remote lake.  The lake is, for some reason, named after an Egyptian crocodile god.
Shortly into their partying, the local member tells the tale of a large crocodile that was brought to the lake some 90 years earlier by a crazy millionaire.  Crocs can live a long time and this one is still about.  But it is only when some drunk fishermen disturb her nest that she makes her presence known in a killing-frenzy.
Of the big croc movies, this one has a slightly more plausible premise for the monster than the rest.  The croc was brought on purpose and it is large, but not abnormally so (about 20 feet).
The croc pursues out characters in a relentless fury with a few tense moments.  The ending is also a bit better than most (except for Lake Placid).
The characters are a little stereotyped for this style movie with no real interesting character development, but we really aren't looking for that in a giant croc film are we?  For the most part the characters act in a realistic fashion for the situation.
This is sort of Lake Placid without the interesting cast.",1053993600,,1132,4.4975609756097565
1377888,5,B00004YS98,"This movie is not going to win any oscars, but it is sure a hell of alot of fun to watch when you are bored on a friday night. The corcodile is ok, it does not look that real, but it has teeth and can eat you. Even now low-budget movies are using CGI effects. Crocodile follws kids into swamp...crocodile eats kids in swamp one by one. Likable characters. A good party movie. Underrated. And for whatever person that wrote in their review andIQuote ""whoever did this film was really dumb"" is very, very wrong. Though many of you do not know it,guess who directed this movie? TOBE HOOPER! The guy who directed ""texas chainsaw massacre"" and ""Poltergeist."" He is not an ammatuer director.

I can tell this wasn't a big budget film which is probably why it didn't, but unlike the other horror ""B"" movies, this deserves to be classified at the top of its genre! It has the same kind of chemistry between characters such as in the ""Scream"" films and the dialogue in this is witty and fun and I actually cared about the characters. I've seen it only once so far several months ago but at this cost, it's worth owning to watch again.

1377891,2,B00004YS98,"Crocodile wants to show all the things that funny scary and smart LAKE PLACID didn't had. Like a stupid group of teenagers and a stupid group of teenagers dead!.From the director of Poltergeist Tobe Hooper.
The plot: A group of teenagers is celebrating the Spring-break by going to lake and having a 3 day party on a super cool boat.
Thanks to Kit(D.W. Reiser) and his girlfriend Annabelle(Julie Mintz).
When some of the kids discover a big crocodile nest, they think that is a good idea to break and crash all the eggs. But Hubs, one of the kid stole an egg, and crocodile is angry.
The characters: Brady, he chaeted to his girlfriend Claire, with a stupid blonde girl called Sunny.
Duncan, is Brady's best friend. They went to school together.
Claire, she wants to be with Brady.
Sunny, she only wants to be with Brady, but she doesn't know that Claire is comming.
Foster and Hubs are friends, they only want to drink beer and sex. But they are too stupid to do that simple things.
After the get really drunk, the crocodile starts to chase them.
But they can't scape, 'cause the ship is broken. So they have to run in to the woods and scape from the big 30feet monster.
The visual effects sucks. The crocodile looks like a toy.
The can't show the entire body, so they go with a mechanic head, that lokks pretty good, in the dead scenes.
A famous director like Tobe Hooper should do a better job that that.
Crocodile is a friday night film, to watch with some friends or a girlfriend.
The acting is bad, the plot is worser and the crocodile visual effects are the worsest of thw worsest.
Cast: Brady(Mark McLaughlin), Claire(Caitlin Martin), Kit(D.W. Reiser), Duncan(Chris Solari), Annabelle(Julie Mintz).
Running time: 90min.
Rated: R
Director: Tobe Hooper

1377905,5,B00004YS98,"This movie is far better than lake placid though some how lake placid has such a high rating for some reson yet I see nothing special about it. This movie though is more thrilling because in here the crocodile actually GETS OUT of the water and chasis every one around. On lake placid he gets outa the water ONCE to chase his victems and that at the end. The crocodile on here is more like a demon though because the croc hunter was saying somthing about him being a a demon and the croc on here has a back far stronger than the crocs on lake placids because aparently it can take a shot from a freakin elephant gun and not get a scratch on it. I also find the croc on here to be more quik and agile and its not predictable. All in all both lake placid and this is very good movie. Anyways the acting,it was pretty good but some of the teens did a horrible job of acting and had no depth once so ever. The F/X is really good and for the croc they use the latest of computerization technology. This I must say is the best gient croc killer movie of all but there is only 2 which is this and lake placid but there are also a few gient killing aligator movies I had saw but they are not near as good as gient croc killin movies. I don't know why but I always been facinated by crocs. Anyway bye now oh yeah and ya gota check out this movie,its pretty good.",1004918400,,1353,4.033457249070632

1377907,3,B00004YS98,"I think people who have reviewed this movie miss the genius of it. Its very absurdity is its saving grace. This flick has two moments that make it into my ""creatures run amok"" hall of fame.
1)The surviving cast members are trolling through the lake when the crocodile BREACHES over their boat. A 30 foot reptile that can barely move for most of the film displays incredible speed and agility for 5 seconds.
2) THe regurgitation. This is almost mythic in concept. Our hero succeds in making the crocodile vomit his recently consumed buddy back to life. I rewound three times.
One sad note. Many of us no doubt remember when ""2000"" was added as a subtext to movies or products in an effort to make it seem more futuristic. Now that we've entered the new millenium, that catchy turn of the phrase is lost to the ages....Crocodile 2000.",998006400,,832,4.590604026845638

Obnoxious 'teen-agers' (some so callous and self-centered you beg for the croc to eat them so the earth will no longer be blighted with their presence) head out for a beer sodden weekend at a lakeside resort.  Things take a turn for the worse when they mess with the eggs of a crocodile that's lurking about, one dofus puts an agg in the backpack of another character and momma croc wants it back.  The rest of the movie is a fill in the blanks escape from the chasing monster story (at least one character ingested or simply killed during each subsequent attack until the 'battle royal' between the 'romantic leads' and their 'trustworthy comic relief sidekick').  Some of the attacks are a tad exciting, but you really won't care who lives or dies, and Hooper does nothing to inject anything original into the visible narrative.
