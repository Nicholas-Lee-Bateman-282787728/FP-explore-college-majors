Goku versus Frieza has to be 1 of my favorite fights in the entire series, and finally seeing it in HD quality with improved voice acting and script really adds to the epicness of this anime. I highly recommend this to your DBZ collection if you haven't already because DBZ Kai is a must buy on blu ray!",1298592000,7,438,3.9886363636363638
5510332,3,B00AUJH3GU,"I love DBZ Kai as a concept, but the episode breaks on the DVD sets are ridiculous. This particular set ends at Episode 52, when the Freeza saga ends at 54.
So, when you're watching the set, get ready for a ridiculous cliffhanger if you're a new viewer, or at the least an awkward break if you're a seasoned vet.
The next set will begin with the episodes ""Goku Delivers the Final Blow"" and ""Z Warriors Reborn"". Those 2 episodes would have easily fit on this set, and been a nice clean break. Then Set 5 could have begun the Android Saga.",1298073600,20,537,4.2745098039215685

5510350,5,B00AUJH3GU,"I was very skeptical of the new dragon ball z kai series. Yes I know that it is the original dragon ball z, but it's not the same through and through. I had to do my research on this before I decided to purchase it. I grew up watching dragon ball z on cartoon network ( I miss that intro *tear*), but I got tired of the staring and shaking at each other for half an episode. All of those things are pointless in the series not to mention how painfully long the frieza saga is.

This is the condensed version of the show we all love and grew up with. All of the pointless staring is gone! But, some of the voice actor's are different as well as some of the original dialogue that goes on between the character's. If you can look past the different voices for some, then this is awesome. I personally like it even though it did take me some time to get over the originals.",1448928000,2,870,4.087719298245614

5510377,4,B00AUJH3GU,"Kai Series Review: This would be an easy 5/5 if the series was actually finished. For those that don't know, Kai ends after the Cell saga and has yet to adapt their version of the Buu storyline. This is being rectified though, according to some of the English voice actors saying they are now working on the rest of the series.

That complaint aside I would say that this easily beats Dragon Ball Z as it cuts most of the filler, which was more often then not god awful. This is a leaner, more action packed series and a much more faithful adaptation of the original manga.

If you're interested in the series then definitely get these Season Sets, they're a great value since they are two volume sets released in one case. The show looks and sounds great, but remains faithful to the original artists intentions. Luckily these sets are 4:3 and aren't changed to look artificially ""hi def"". If you want to see what I'm alluding too then check out the DBZ Season 1 set, that's a joke. Stick with Kai for now.",1390262400,2,1007,4.437837837837838
5510378,5,B00AUJH3GU,"Dragon Ball Z Kai: Season Four [Blu-ray] comes with 4 disc. Episodes 78-98. Quality and Sound are superb the Aspect ration is 4:3 the original ration Dragon Ball/Z/GT was first aired. Lots of action, lot of the filler that the original dub had is gone. The picture quality is good. However, sometimes it switches from the new Kai scenes to the original which is no big deal since it still looks better than the original. The Japanese BGM is only on here no Bruce Faulconer Music which sucks but didn't bother me. 1080p native on Blu-Ray. All Disc come with English dub with reedited dialogue also Japanese with sub titles and in my opinion this version has a better Dub than the original dialogue. Its uncut with blood and some curse words which is cool see since the original did not have that. Not 100% true to the manga but close. Really recommend to anyone has is a fan of DBZ to give Kai a try. Even myself a long time fan since watching as a kid back on Toonami was bit spectacle about Kai. Cannot wait for the rest of the Sagas to be released sometime in 2014.

World Tournament Saga
Babidi Saga
Majin Buu Saga

5510387,5,B00AUJH3GU,"If you're looking at buying this, you've probably already had experience with the first 3 seasons. This is DBZ without filler and with a couple new voice actors. On this release, the redrawn scenes are to a minimum which is a good thing. The voice acting is vastly superior to the original recordings, though I will say I do miss gohan's old voice actor, even though the current does a good job. The script is much more consistent and of higher quality; there are no misconceptions of characterization this time around. It's a solid finale to the series, and they were able to put the ending scenes together well. Censorship which is most people's biggest turnoff to this series is basically nonexistent in this particular season, so it's definitely a treat by the end.",1370476800,2,769,4.746268656716418
5510388,3,B00AUJH3GU,"First: OG Dragonball fan. I've watched and PAINFULLY waited for every new episode and series for most of my life. I love DBZ... No matter how much it makes me wait.

Now then. DBZ Kai is awesome. To anyone who has involved their lives with this show. My friends rave at how cool this show is. I sigh thinking of how many hundreds of hours they haven't seen. HUNDREDS.... As a true blue fan, I cant say this was done right. It was done well and probably should have been done this way... but still. It does kill me a little bit to blow past the show in a mere 98 episodes.

To ""Kai"" up this review... and I do mean cut it short... I would like to say to all fans: Watch it. It does bring back some special memories. Are the fights as epic and cool? No. Does the tiny bit of story reveal enough to keep you going? Yes. Uncut? Yeah.... If you haven't seen the uncut for the 8 billionth time. Still no swearing. Oh well. They tried.

Give a good old fashioned Galic Gun (Vegeta for life) to your mind and relive your childhood. Cheers.

It is much better than Dragon Ball Z becuase of it's amazing voice acting, it's trueness to the book, and it's superior sound and quality! However, I would never suggest anyone to buy this for over 100 dollars! So I recommend that if you want to purchase it, get it used or go over to the Dragon Box's which have the same amount of quality as Kai but are not as pricey. However, the Dragon Boxes contain all of the filler and, therefor, have a slower moving story... So keep that in mind.

Overall, I was satisfied with the product and enjoyed watching every minute of it. Also another great thing about this DVD (Which I suspect is the reason it's so pricey) is that it contains the Kenji Yamamoto score. Which is really great!

I don`t give it 5 stars because the 4:3 format and extension of each volume. I know the 4:3 is the original format, but i really liked to see an effort to expand the picture relation to 16:9, and of course, more minutes of show per volume.

5510403,5,B00AUJH3GU,"At last - Dragon Ball Z Kai Part Four. I'd been collecting the Kai DVDs and working my way through the episodes, and had been looking forward to this set for a few reasons.

First of all, let me say that I've been continually impressed with FUNimation's dub throughout this whole experience, and have stuck with it as my language choice. This is different for me because I'm usually a subtitle kind of person (direct translations, less silly voices, etc) but FUNimaton has surprised me with how good their English language track is, so much so that I feel I need to keep 'checking' it to see if they stay on track with their translations. Why? Well, if you'll allow me to sound a bit fanboyish for a moment, their old 'Z' dub was so monumentally bad that I want to make sure they're atoning for their 'sins' and whatnot. They've got a lot to make up for, darn it.

Anyway, there are two scenes in particular on this set that I just had to see if FUNimation got right the second time around. The first is a scene where (without spoiling anything) something very significant happens to Vegeta. FUNimation handled it rather badly in their old dub, rewriting and mistranslating dialogue to the point where it probably misled some people into drawing the wrong conclusions. FUNimation did a superb job with it this time and didn't stray from the original script once. I'm impressed. Check one.

Then there is the matter of Goku's Super Saiyan transformation. After fighting Freeza and outclassing him for an episode, Goku gives a small declaration speech that was also mistranslated last time. In the old dub it was some ""I am the light in the darkness!"" superhero speech crap that was as over the top and ridiculous as a Ginyu Force pose. Yeah, it might've been cool when we were watching the show back in high school, but that was before we were old enough to know better, and trust me when I say it was BAD. FUNimation, redeeming themselves, came through once again and set wrongs right. They even used Goku's surname 'Son', which is probably the first time that's ever happened in the English dub.

This set covers the big showdown between Goku and Freeza, one of the most significant and famous battles in the series. Toei's ability to condense Kai continues to be impressive. In the original 'Z' the fight lasted twenty episodes. TWENTY. Do you know how impossibly long that is? I remember watching the episodes for the first time as a teen when they were on Toonami, and being pumped up when the fight first started. By the end I was aching for it to be over and done with. You cannot watch the same two guys fight for hours and hours without getting bored, or at least I can't. Needless to say, I wanted to see how a twenty bloody episode battle could be edited to where it'd be watchable in one sitting. Kai's version of the fight is whittled down enough that the majority of it fits on this set. I think there's one more episode of the Freeza saga that spills over into the next set that's actually part of the fight itself. Trust me, it saves a LOT of time and is much better this way.

Kai  does a clever job of leaving out filler that wasn't in the manga, except for some stuff needed to bring out episodes to full length. Understandable. Sadly, the whole ""Captain Ginyu's return"" subplot is left in. That's unfortunate, because it was a ridiculous and stupid filler idea to begin with, maybe even a match for Goku's spacepod projecting an image of the moon in terms of utter banality. I'm glad it's resolved quickly. I suppose I shouldn't complain though, because there are other bad filler moments from the fight that were left on the cutting room floor, like the Ginyu Force being invited to King Kai's planet. Ugh. I'm so glad that's gone now.

And the episodes continue to be uncut for the DVDs, although they're still subject to the censoring that was done by Toei itself to conform to Japan's new television broadcast standards. I don't mind. When it comes to censorship, my belief is that it's not as bad if it was done overseas by the original studio itself; it's only when an American company starts painting over artwork and imposing their own standards on existing foreign material that I have an issue. I bring this up, though, because Toei's censorship is a little... inconsistent. Like they'll break out the digital paint when Vegeta coughs up blood in one scene, but do nothing when Freeza spits out a big ol' glob of the red stuff later.

Now onto Part Five, with its lack of a Garlic Jr. saga! Hooray!",1313884800,7,4527,4.559655596555966

5510406,4,B00AUJH3GU,"I grew loving Dragon Ball Z but was in a position that I would never see it again because it is so full of filler that I quite simply did not have time to go through all of it again. Dragon Ball Z Kai does away with this and gives me a reason to rewatch the anime without as much filler, the English voice acting is quite good and you always have the option to see in the original Japanese with subtitles, the music is not as good (but that is mostly nostalgia talking) but the animation has been cleaned and it looks better than ever.

The good:

The Namek saga is finally coming to an end, our heroes are doing everything they can to fight against Frieza, Goku will finally be healed and have a battle with the most powerful being in the universe.

The bad:

It might be all the years that have passed since I first watched Dragon Ball Z, but it likes to hold your hand in the most idiotic ways possible. The fight against Frieza is full of obvious, bothersome comments by King Kai that could have been removed altogether from the anime for example (spoiler): Goku hits Frieza with a spirit bomb, after all the characters in Namek celebrate because they finally won King Kai comments that they finally won; but Frieza survives and as he is coming out of the rubble all characters are scared because he survived then King Kai comments that all hope is lost.",1310860800,,1358,4.334645669291339
5510407,5,B00AUJH3GU,"I have been a loyal fan of Dragon Ball Z since I was younger and watching the original run on Toonami and on VHS. I drifted away from DBZ for many years but have been an anime enthusiast ever since DBZ got me hooked.

Dragon Ball Z Kai caught my eye for several reasons: mainly being remastered yet retaining the original 4:3 aspect ratio (unlike the previous two versions that chopped part of the format to be presented in pseudo widescreen). I have faithfully purchased the Kai series (the titles released so far) on Blu-Ray. Here are my thoughts:

Part four takes us through the remainder of the Freiza saga.  Let's just say this is probably the most action packed set of episodes in the entire series except maybe the cell games saga (and a brief bit of crazy action during the Vegeta: Cell: Android: Piccolo fights leading up to Perfect Cell).

Technical stuff:
The ratio is kept to the original 4:3 aspect. Some animations have been cleaned and even re-animated (in the case of some of the lighting effects from ki attacks and power-ups). Some of the re-animated shots look like something from American Saturday morning cartoons rather than anime, but these instances were very rare. The two that stood out were in a previous volume anyway.

The sound is vastly superior to the previous versions. The English dub is improved and they aren't afraid to get a little dirty (they swear often, but not in an offensive way. They just yell 'you bastard' a lot). Though the few uses of swearing is in line with the more literal translation. Also, the American voice acting is a lot better this time through. Most of the lines have been slightly changed to stick closer to the actual translation. The Japanese voice acting is the original (highly amusing in some roles) though it has also been cleaned up a bit so that static is removed.

The music is the original Japanese score, just re-digitized for this release. It is superior to the original Japanese and the American scores (though the American score was pretty good considering).

Editing:
Here is where most die hard Dragon Ball Z fans choke up: There is a lot of cut content. I have seen the original, un-cut, American and Japanese versions. I gotta tell you. You're not missing anything. Most of what was cut was pure filler by TOEI trying to fill time slots. They've also removed a lot of re-used cells. I remember how annoyed I was to see Piccolo battling the Android and TOEI reusing animation cells from the Piccolo-Raditz battle. Seriously. Also, I don't hear too many people upset about missing out on the Garlic Jr saga.

They cut about 50 episodes (give or take) and reduced the amount to 98 (through the Cell Games saga). I don't know if they will continue through the Buu saga (no word yet even in Japan), but I am a huge fan on the improvement in quality of picture and sound so I hope they do.

Also of note: the Blu-Ray version is presented in full HD, though the original show was analog and standard definition. There is a noticeable difference between the DVD and Blu-Ray version in animation clarity and quality. There is also a major difference on the sound. The difference is worth the $2 or so for the Blu-Ray vs DVD if you have a player.",1309910400,12,3216,4.598603839441536
5510408,4,B00AUJH3GU,"Growing up as a DBZ fanatic, I had to have this for obvious reasons. It's a great idea for them to make Kai to add create a new fan base of the series. Overall I enjoyed this collection, but I did have some gripes. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is not perfect; in most of the scenes with King Kai, the audio had problems where it would cut out for most of the scene. Being an avid fan of the series it was frustrating for me. But, it did not have that large of an impact on the whole of it. So, if you are thinking about buying this, I would say do it; and if you are looking at getting into the series, do it, because Goku is the greatest hero ever created.",1309478400,2,671,3.8345323741007196
5510409,5,B00AUJH3GU,"What makes part four the best of all? There's no villain like Furiiza.

The animation in 1080p HD, the music (made intense), new scenes, no fillers in the way, it made exactly as FUNimation said.

This was epic, but the last episode may make you sad seeing Furiiza's sliced to various parts and also leaves you waiting for part five.

A little note I would like to leave is that, the release delay from May to June is due to Yamamoto's scandal and so the BGM music will be replaced with the original Japanese DBZ BGM from the brilliant Kikuchi.",1304553600,,544,4.42
5510410,5,B00AUJH3GU,"I have been watching DBZ for about 10 years now, and I am happy that I can finally watch every episode and not get bored from all the fillers and stand-offs from the original.

Likes-
New intro
Fixing of the scenes that were damaged over the years
Taking out the fillers
Better English dialogue
Excellent sound quality
Pretty much exactly like the manga
New animated breaks in between parts of an episode that actually change as the episodes progress.

Dislikes-
No marathon mode
There is no need for two discs, the data on both discs can easily fit on a single bluray disc.
There was an art error in a scene where Krillin is shown high up in the sky, he is wearing the orange and blue outfit rather than ""Frieza's henchmen"" get up.

In Part Four of the series we are left with a big clif-hanger. The end of planet Namek is imminent, only a few more episodes till it explodes. Part 5 comes out in June with the Trunks and the Android sagas. I love this ""new"" series, sad to see that they ended with the Cell Games saga in Japan...",1302912000,,1030,4.3264248704663215
5510411,5,B00AUJH3GU,"Along with the obvious bonus of less filler, Dragon Ball Z Kai has been re-dubbed, and I would like to say it has been superbly done. Not long ago, I re-watched much of the HD-released Funimation dub, and I have been able to compare the two. DBZ Kai has kept the flavor of the show and put much more depth into it. Three episodes into Disc One of Part Four, you will see what I mean. The new Japanese music is wonderful and actually adds a great deal of emotion to otherwise flat scenes. Despite what you may remember from the old days of DBZ, this show is no longer for little kids. (Sure, it's still a cartoon, but it's certainly not Y7)
