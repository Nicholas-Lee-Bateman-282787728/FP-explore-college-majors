3060282,2,B001152THK,"This is for the entire series.

I've seen Blood: The Last Vampire  movie.  That was great.  Read the novel Night of the Beasts by Mamoru Oshi.  That was great.  If you were expected a story line that was in place with either one of those two you will be deeply disappointed.  This series has so many fits and stops.  You could compare it to a beat up Yugo.  The action would start only to stop suddenly for ""help me am a vampire slayer but I don't know who I am"", or ""I can't do this because I care for my family"", or forget it.  The Sai in this is series is an embarrassment to the Sai of the movie and novel.

If you like your anime sweet and nice with plenty of ""emotions"" that get in the way and ruin a good action run and the story.  This is for you.

If you think this series has a good of a concise plot as the movie or novel, please don't.  The series will mostly just agitate and annoy you like it did me.
I got tired with the series after episode 3.  I watched it in its entirety to see will it get better, it didn't.

This series immediately grabbed my attention from episode 1 with its magnificently crafted storyline, depth of characters, and interesting blend of mystery, romance, and action.

Now, after living with a family for a year, she is needed to fight again.  The Chiropterans, just another name for vampires, are back.  And it looks like the American Army may have something to do with them.  Can Saya and those who fight the darkness that may spread over the Earth stop the vampires before it becomes too late?  Will Kai go out with Mao?  Will Julia wear anything outside of that bland doctor's outfit?  Will David ever smile?  Well, let's move on.
Great music, great artwork, kind of lame opening credits, but the overall setting is perfect.  Just the right amount of hope and fear, of dreams and nightmares.  What is normal and what is just under the surface of reality?  And five episodes on one DVD!  Get it.",1209600000,3,873,4.408805031446541

3060286,5,B001152THK,"Blood + is more than just a gory vampire show.  It shows a long history of two sisters, those who serve and protect them and why they are trying to kill each other.  It also shows the struggling relationship between Saya and Kai.  Kai knows that Saya is a Vampire like monster but still says that she is still his little sister and he will protect her no matter what.  There are many underlieing stories combined in the siries than just the main one.  I would recomend this to everyone who likes Anime.  It is excelently drawn, and very realistic.  The move that came before it though, I would not recomend that you watch it.  It does not cover anything about the siries, just shows what would be a two part episode, very poorly drawn and not life like at all.

3060287,4,B001152THK,"Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy mysterious people, or as bloodthirsty monsters. In ""Blood+,"" you get two for the price of one.

And this unusual vampire anime gets off to a solid start in the first volume -- there's plenty of gory, taut action scenes, as well as some mystery and slow exposition. While it's technically a spinoff of a movie, this series stands easily on its own -- lots of action, monsters, and gallons of vampiric blood.

Saya Otonashi is anemic, and she doesn't remember anything about her life before she was adopted by a kindly veteran, George, and his sons Kai and Riku. Other than that, she's a perfectly normal Okinawa schoolgirl. Then a monster attacks her, one night at her high school.

She's saved by a beautiful, mysterious man carrying a cello case, who forces her to drink a little of his blood. She destroys the monster in a matter of seconds -- unaware that her punky, overprotective brother Kai also saw the monster. Soon American military forces arrive to clean up, and everything is hushes up.

And Saya's confusion only grows when she finds that George is discussing her mysterious past with a man named David. She goes on a search for answers -- both from the cellist, Haji, and from George. But then George is attached by one of the monstrous, vampiric Chiropterans, and Saya finds that she may be the only one who can stop it.

Technically ""Blood+"" is actually a spinoff from an older anime movie, ""Blood: The Last Vampire."" But while that movie concentrated on action and monsters, the show seems to be more interested in exploring a young vampire girl's growing problems, and exploring this unique vampire mythos. And it IS pretty unique -- it's more like a disease than a supernatural unlife.

The first few episodes basically set up the rest of the series, introducing mysterious organizations, vendettas, and monsters that will drag you up into a tree and rip off your head. There are some warm'n'cuddly moments in the Otonashi family, but they're outweighed by Saya's sinister past, bloody slayings, and David's organization. And the amazing thing is, there's still plenty of unanswered questions.

It also has really gorgeous animation, which is more realistic than many anime series have. Very sleek, dark, sharply-defined, and vaguely gothic in appearance, and given extra beauty by the cello melodies that Haji is always playing. The script is pretty good as well, although most of the best lines are stolen by Kai (""Time to have fun.... without YOU!"").

Saya is a likable heroine at the start -- she's an optimistic, ordinary schoolgirl who only has one real problem (amnesia). But we do get to see some of her darker sides when she's fighting, and Kari Wahlgren does an excellent job with both sides of Saya's personality.

Most of the other characters aren't explored yet, but George's tragic past and Kai's punky, protective attitude make them seem very well-rounded. And though we don't get much information about Haji, the cello-playing vampire is an intriguing character. Being voiced by Crispin Freeman doesn't hurt either.

The first volume of ""Blood+"" is a nice introduction to this gory, unique action anime, with lots of vampires and buckets of blood. But don't watch it after dark.",1198195200,23,3251,4.916058394160584

However, she is soon revealed to be an ancient vampire with an evil twin attempting to flood the world with hideous monsters. This is revealed to her through her mysterious friend Haji, and she soon acquires many different friends ranging from David, who's a stiff and stalwart and all round serious minded individual with a serious drive about nearly everything, to Louis, a pudgy but friendly Jamaican man who's surprisingly tough (and never gets injured a single time) and can raise some serious hell with his arsenal of guns. Others include Kai, a young but impressionable and surprisingly tough kid joins her on her quest. You'll meet courageous journalists, wickedly powerful vampires, and the mysterious and psychotic Diva, who is the one responsible for it all.

If you really want to watch this series you should go with the increadibly expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Part-One-with-Bonus-Disc/dp/B001152THA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood +: Part One with Bonus Disc</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Part-Two/dp/B002KPUMZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood +: Part Two</a>, however that (at the time I'm writing this) is extremely expensive, approx $250 for USED and $400 for NEW.

So if you don't mind not finishing the story that at episode 20 is still building up, I encourage you to get this, but if you like to see things through to the end (like me) you're better off without it.",1323129600,16,995,6.158273381294964
3060327,4,B001152THK,"This DVD contains the first five episodes of a 50-part series, so it mostly covers some intial character and story development. Most of the important protagonists are introduced, and the central plot involving Saya's battles with the Chiroptera (sort-of-vampiric man/bat monsters) is established. The scene is quickly set for an exciting and thought-provoking series, combining elements of action, drama, horror, and military conspiracies. In particular, some of these early episodes contain an interesting exploration of the mixed relationship between the Japanese and the US military in Okinawa.

Saya herself is a fantastic character, at least early on. For once we have an anime school-girl heroine who is not a big-breasted bimbo or an obnoxious brat or a flaky ditz. Her character is equally believable as a normal high school girl and a ruthless monster slayer. Her initial battle in particular (Episode 2) is beautifully choreographed and animated. The early episodes establish the complex dynamic between Saya and the various men who in their own way try to protect her; Hagi, George, David, and Kai. Kai is perhaps a bit too cliche'd as the typical anime Bad Boy With A Heart Of Gold, but his character does develop over the series. The mysterious Hagi is a fan favourite, and David and Julia present as interesting characters as well. One major antagonist is introduced early on, but the mysteries unravel slowly, and most of the other important villans remain hidden until later in the series.

I would certainly recommend this DVD, in fact everything up to Episode 13 (the end of the Vietnam thread, which is almost a self-contained story). But if you're going to buy this then you need to know that the early episodes are about as good as 'Blood Plus' gets. From Episode 14 onwards the momentum begins to sag as a variety of sub-plots and a host of new characters are introduced. The action also moves from country to country and across several continents, and combined with the large cast and mulitple plots it can become difficult to follow exactly what is happening where. There are plenty of battles, but none are as beautifully done as that first fight in Episode 2. And while Saya's ""Why must I fight?! Why can't I live a normal life?!"" angsting is fine early on, they drag it on and on and on. Time and again she is faced with situations where her refusal to fight threatens those close to her, but she never seems to snap out of her angst until quite late in the series, after a particularly devastating loss.

The individual DVD gets four stars, but the series overall doesn't live up to the promise the opening gives it. It's your call whether you're prepared follow the series to completion despite it being not as good as the early episodes.",1271203200,,2767,4.870488322717622

3294823,2,B001152THK,"Okay, first off I really enjoyed it, but there's a major flaw, these volumes (1-4) only have 5 episodes each and there seems to be no plans on releasing more so going with these volumes you'll only make it to episode 20 out of a total of 50 episodes. If you really want to watch this series you should go with the increadibly expensive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Part-One-with-Bonus-Disc/dp/B001152THA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood +: Part One with Bonus Disc</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Part-Two/dp/B002KPUMZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood +: Part Two</a>, however that (at the time I'm writing this) is extremely expensive, approx $250 for USED and $400 for NEW.

So if you don't mind not finishing the story that at episode 20 is still building up, I encourage you to get this, but if you like to see things through to the end (like me) you're better off without it.",1323129600,16,995,6.158273381294964
3294824,4,B001152THK,"This DVD contains the first five episodes of a 50-part series, so it mostly covers some intial character and story development. Most of the important protagonists are introduced, and the central plot involving Saya's battles with the Chiroptera (sort-of-vampiric man/bat monsters) is established. The scene is quickly set for an exciting and thought-provoking series, combining elements of action, drama, horror, and military conspiracies. In particular, some of these early episodes contain an interesting exploration of the mixed relationship between the Japanese and the US military in Okinawa.

Saya herself is a fantastic character, at least early on. For once we have an anime school-girl heroine who is not a big-breasted bimbo or an obnoxious brat or a flaky ditz. Her character is equally believable as a normal high school girl and a ruthless monster slayer. Her initial battle in particular (Episode 2) is beautifully choreographed and animated. The early episodes establish the complex dynamic between Saya and the various men who in their own way try to protect her; Hagi, George, David, and Kai. Kai is perhaps a bit too cliche'd as the typical anime Bad Boy With A Heart Of Gold, but his character does develop over the series. The mysterious Hagi is a fan favourite, and David and Julia present as interesting characters as well. One major antagonist is introduced early on, but the mysteries unravel slowly, and most of the other important villans remain hidden until later in the series.

I would certainly recommend this DVD, in fact everything up to Episode 13 (the end of the Vietnam thread, which is almost a self-contained story). But if you're going to buy this then you need to know that the early episodes are about as good as 'Blood Plus' gets. From Episode 14 onwards the momentum begins to sag as a variety of sub-plots and a host of new characters are introduced. The action also moves from country to country and across several continents, and combined with the large cast and mulitple plots it can become difficult to follow exactly what is happening where. There are plenty of battles, but none are as beautifully done as that first fight in Episode 2. And while Saya's ""Why must I fight?! Why can't I live a normal life?!"" angsting is fine early on, they drag it on and on and on. Time and again she is faced with situations where her refusal to fight threatens those close to her, but she never seems to snap out of her angst until quite late in the series, after a particularly devastating loss.

The individual DVD gets four stars, but the series overall doesn't live up to the promise the opening gives it. It's your call whether you're prepared follow the series to completion despite it being not as good as the early episodes.",1271203200,,2767,4.870488322717622

Not childish like some anime but dramatic, suspenseful and well presented. As the main character discovers who and what she is her character continues to build, there are lots of plot twists that build to the suprizing  final ending in vol 4. This is absolutely worth adding to your collection.",1510617600,,429,4.72
