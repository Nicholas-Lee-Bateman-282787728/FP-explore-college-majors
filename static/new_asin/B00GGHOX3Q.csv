6075194,5,B00GGHOX3Q,To be fair I have only seen this Japanese with english sub.  Loved it.  However as the other reciew has said and I agree with him for virtually every anime.  English dub tends to take away from the nature of how the anime was intended to portray.,1447977600,,246,4.191489361702128
6075195,2,B00GGHOX3Q,"First let me say that I do speak Japanese so my copy is in Japanese, and have had it since 2011 and it came from Japan. It is NOT CENSORED. Hino Akiharu lost his parents when he was very young and was adopted into his Uncle's family. But he noticed that his Uncle was after the inheritance his parents left him, so he decides to enter a boarding school, Hakureiyou High school. This school is free for Maids and Butlers and is paid buy the ( upper Education Ladies ) that enroll. However his delinquent boy-like appearance frightens the upper ed girls, who make up the majority of the students. In fact the very first person hino runs into is one Selnia Lorrie Flameheart from England of course. He hasn't even enrolled yet and is attacked buy Flameheart who is boarded and decides to cure her boredom by going after Hino, after some words Hino is knocked to the ground with Flameheart who falls under him his hands on her breast as she lay under him she comes too and starts crying that her father hasn't even touched her breast before him. Flameheart starts to chase Hino around Hakureiryou in an effort to throw him off school ground. A whole bunch of misshapes befall Hino before he runs in Saikyou Tomomi his Osoganogami (childhood friend).  The laughter never stops and neather dose the fan service which is on par with Freezing or Ikki Tousen the music that opens is like your High School cheerleader fight songs. I loved it. This is one of the greatest anime cult classics to come to America. Look if you don't like it I will buy your copy from you that's how sure I am that this is the funnest anime you will ever see. I am editing or amending my review in regards to the dub over only.  First let again say that I love anime and have since I first laid eyes on it back in 1963 with Astro boy Gigantor and 8 Man. I have never been shy of being an Otaku. So why am I in tears, because Media Blaster has blasphemed Ladies versus Butlers with their dub over.  First the script is sub par at best and the voice actors might as well be zombies.  They cant even properly pronounce the names of the Japanese players.  My 10 year old Niece can act better than they can, they used unknown actors with the exception of Carrie Savage and Genevieve Simmons, but even their work was so bad as to be a waste of time and money. After saying all that this is still my all time favorite anime of all time and prefer it in the Japanese language at least the Japanese now how to act witch is more than I can say for our English Language counterparts. So In English Language I give it  2 out of 5 stars but in the Japanese Language 5 of 5 all day long. I hope that if you have never seen it in Japanese you will survive the English version but if you have well I cant say you will. This just proves that if your not going to do it right than just don't touch it and ruin it. other than that have fun!",1440806400,16,2889,4.215189873417722

6075202,1,B00GGHOX3Q,"The anime itself is good, but the actual DVD product was bad. There are 3 disks, the 1st and 3rd disk are JUST video files. It contains all needed video files: all episodes supposed to be on that disk (and thankfully in order), trailers, and even menu video files but that's all it is, just video. There's no working menu and there is no subtitles; there are, however, Japanese and English dub which I found interesting but each time the disk loads the next video file, it will be defaulted to the set Japanese or English dub, it's random for each files so you always have to ready yourself to reset audio to Japanese or English (whichever one you prefer, keep in mind though there are no subtitles). The 2nd disk worked just fine: it had a working menu, it had subtitles, it had everything a normal working DVD should have. I would have considered the 1st disk defective had the 3rd disk not have been the exact same way. My advise, go for Blu-Ray. If you only have a DVD player AND purely only care about the content AND you are okay with English dub (or if you know Japanese) AND are okay with no subtitles, then go right on ahead and purchase the DVD, otherwise, steer clear of it.",1486684800,10,1185,4.366515837104072

6075209,4,B00GGHOX3Q,"Hilarious in many respects. Hit or miss in others. If you're an anime fan with fan service and par for the course storyline, then Ladies Versus Butlers is for you.

The English dub isn't the best, nor the worst, it's just good. Unlike Funimation releases, and this is my own opinion, the voice actors seem flat and uninterested in what's going on. If you plan to see this, go with the Japanese audio for language options.

The animation is very fluid, no corners cut in terms of animation quality. Bright colors fill your screen and are a step above usual fair you get from other studios.

In terms of if this is a buy or not, I'd say yes, but go with the japanese audio option if you have the choice.",1471824000,,701,4.33587786259542

6075214,2,B00GGHOX3Q,"Just another stupid harem show, wait... I just insulted all the stupid people out there. All this is a show that gives not only fan service but lot of skin also. A lot of characters in here you really couldn't care about and, makes Girls Bravo (not that great but the characters are more fleshed out, and yes the pun is intended.) a masterpiece. These types of harems shows are more creepier then exciting. To Luv Ru had more life in their characters was actually more likeable even thou the main guy was a perv.
To sum it up, made cheaply and by people who haven't hit puperty yet.
This set went directly to the bottom shelf on the end with the couple others I regretted.

6075217,3,B00GGHOX3Q,"The video quality is great, as you would expect, but there are a few grievances that I have that might want people to think twice before buying this release. This ""collection"" only includes the standard episodes with no extras. It is missing the OVAs (which I suspect may have been excluded for ratings purposes) and there are no clean opening and ending credits. This are standard feature in the Japanese releases and these episodes are of the same quality you could find online so the missing features makes it feel like someone burned a copy of the episodes on a streaming site and put little effort into the physical release for collectors. Another thing I have an issue with is the subtitles themselves. Not only are they excessively huge even when the word count is only a few, the subtitle coloring is the glaring yellow that anime fans of old will remember (and not so fondly). Why are they not white? Why does the word size not scale properly with the screen so that it doesn't cover the actual video? These are the things I noticed quite quickly after only looking through the release because I had suspected missing content when I received my item. If these things concern you as well, you may want to rethink purchasing this release.",1458691200,12,1245,4.663636363636364

6075219,4,B00GGHOX3Q,Fun fanservice show lots of nudity. Always enjoyable. No real plot or ending. But I enjoy it for the boobs. Sadly contains none of the Specials they were the best fap material.,1456876800,11,176,4.53125
6075220,5,B00GGHOX3Q,"Its not good or right, but many anime in the ecchi harem genre are aces at fanservice but dismal failures at being entertaining in any other sense. You get the feeling that the production team spent all their budget on boob animation, threw in an idle boner joke or two, and sent their product out into the world, knowing that it would sell no matter how lame it was. Im happy to report that Ladies Versus Butlers didn't take this easy route  by dint of extra effort, it manages to have its boobs and be hilarious and sweet, too.

Ladies Versus Butlers takes place at a unique high school that teaches the children of the wealthy or well-connected to be either proper ladies and gentlemen or world-class servants (depending on their familys economic situation) in the same way that other Japanese high schools teach trades of technology, agriculture, or so forth. Into this genteel environment wanders Akiharu Hino, a thuggish-looking but kind guy who wants to become a butler but has the usual harem male lead luck when it comes to getting into compromising situations. He quickly becomes the nemesis of the easily-flustered British girl Selnia Flameheart and the pawn (again) of his pretty but trollish childhood friend, Tomomi Saikyou. Akiharus predilection for getting caught up in others troubles soon wins him points with these two girls and other members of the mostly-female student body, aaaaand were off to your standard love octagon! ;)

I should stress that this anime is an ecchi romantic comedy, meaning they pack as much jiggling, wardrobe malfunctions, sexually awkward moments, and convenient camerawork as its humanly possible to fit into 12 episodes. In that sense, it accomplished its minimal selling point right there. What I came to love about this show, though, is that its also honest-to-god funny. Better yet, it accomplishes its humor and even its fanservice in a way that still seems to respect the characters  you don't think less of any of them for the suggestive faux-pas they fall into, and its all in good fun. We also get to see relationships slowly evolve in this series rather than fall into place just because. The cast itself is pretty great. In addition to the three I mentioned already, Kaoru Daisuke (Hinos roommate) is interesting enough to deserve a show of ___ own (blank left intentionally, haha), and the diverse crew at the school all have their own quirks. Lastly, I also enjoyed the distinctive art style  the mostly-absent noses and cartoonish expressions were unusual but cute.

While a lot of the positive points of this release stem from the original show, Media Blasters deserves huge props for delivering a stellar Blu-Ray release of this series. First and foremost, their dub is fantastic. I have no idea what bee got caught in that other reviewers bonnet, but these actresses and actors brought the cast to life perfectly and vibrantly in my opinion. (And while I love and respect the work they do, I have to say that it was also great to hear some *different* English voice actors  Funimations and Sentais dozen regulars have become so ubiquitous that its problematic.) The video and audio quality are also crystal-clear, which was important for Media Blasters to get right in light of some questionable recent releases. Im glad to say they nailed this one. Finally, the price of this set is a bargain compared to pretty much any other distributor and won't break your pocketbook. Literally the only negative thing I could say about the release is that a broader selection of extras would have been nice, but with the main product so solid, Ill hold my criticisms.

In a nutshell, Ladies Versus Butlers is a good example of the positive effects of a little effort. An anime with this much toplessness and silk-thin blouses didn't have to be so good, but it took the trouble to be, anyway. As long as rampant fanservice doesnt bother you, give it a shot.",1456531200,20,3910,4.851574212893553
6075221,5,B00GGHOX3Q,"I'm very disappointed in amazon.ca. I preordered my copy there months ago but it has still not shipped and they have a wrong release date listed, plus shows it is not available. I emailed them about it before release date and have not had a proper reply. As amazon.com is too expensive on shipping to Canada, I may cancel my order with amazon.ca and re-order from dvdpacific for nearly the same price. THEY have it in stock.

It's a great ecchi comedy series with two girls (both  from wealthy families) who end up in competition for the same boy, who is on a scholarship training to be  a butler One guy, a childhood friend, loves creating mischief and blackmailing him,. The other is a typical tsundere blonde. The extra shorts included are, as usual, full of frontal female nudity and risque comedy. There is both character and plot development in this short series. It's well worth buying and watching. I ordered the dvd version when it was first announced and was disappointed when it was cancelled, but happy when I heard they were releasing it on blu-ray and with an English dub as a bonus. I'm not sure what the dub is like but the original Japanese voices are great, so even if you are a dub fan, please take a listen.",1454803200,2,1227,4.518018018018018

6075225,5,B00GGHOX3Q,"For the anime series itself and not for the Blu-ray version itself, this is a clear 4 and one-half starred effort, not for anything of monument reasons but because this effort is just plain funny, start to finish. The original and uncensored version has been out of some years and this dubbed version is presently available in DVD format, by the same people that will offer it up in the Blu-ray version in Feb. However, at another well-known site that offers LEGAL and authorized editions, the DVD is selling for about 19 bucks and the Blu-ray, when it is released in Feb., will go for about $22. As there is no spectacular artwork that would require Blu-ray, save a couple of bucks and enjoy it now.
The script for the dubbed version isn't near as funny as the subtitled version but with the dubbed version, you can spend more time looking at the boobies. Boobs from ones with their own Zip codes each to the size of,perhaps, a normal 8-year-old,( she claims to be,"" I'm already 19 years old and a lady...!"" but has spent much of her life in a hospital -don't they all!?- so she is just built like an eight year old.) and every size in-between.
This private school has hundreds of future ladies and maids but only 5 future butler males, maybe, although one freaky one only makes about half-dozen not short enough appearances.
There is nothing earth-shattering about this effort that would require deep thought nor prolonged study. This is just as it appears; never-stop slap-stick funny and nasty but not vulgar.
