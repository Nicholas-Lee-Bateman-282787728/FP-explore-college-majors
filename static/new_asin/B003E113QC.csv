8395112,5,B003E113QC,"This ""spectacle"" performance of Stravinsky's ""Firebird, "" performed by the Orchestre de Paris is conducted by Pierre Boulez at one of Western Civilization's great spaces, the Louvre. I.M. Pei's grand Pyramid is featured with stunning views inside and out. Its visual impact, its photographic asides (the shadowy presence of the mezzanine onlookers), adds to the wispy aural beauty of Stravinsky's early and popular masterpiece; start with the geometric patterns of the Pyramid set in contrast to the Louvre's Renaissance architecture at dusk as Paris goes home.

Boulez's personal understated presence should not disguise the crisp, clarity and purity of his orchestration.  Stravinsky's soft harmonic - almost playful - score is often ignored when set against the rolling crescendo of its tumultuous ending. The orchestra,  men in white shirts, women black clad,  is led by the accomplished concert master, Phillipe Aiche. The visual symbolism of the Louvre, the Pyramid and Boulez tied to the ending dimuendo is a lovely and impressive end to the piece.

EuroArts specializes in these moving performances of notable classical music, of world renowned orchestras, and famous conductors in exquisite venues.  Its creative use of technology and its direction impresses with close up shots of the orchestra; the slow motion of the cameras on tracks is hardly noticed.  Bravo Director Andy Sommer for his directorial artistry adding to the genius of Stravinsky. This is a superb and exhilarating performance.",1423699200,,1505,5.461206896551724
8395113,4,B003E113QC,"I haven't been to Paris.  The Louvre ranks high on the list of places in the world that I very much would like to see. Igor Stravinsky's Firebird Suite is one of the most challenging and beautiful pieces of music created in the 20th century.  To combine both of these masterpieces into one is a stroke of pure genius.  Add on top Pierre Boulez conducting and you have struck gold.

The ""Live at the Louvre"" DVD by ideale audience is a sumptuous feast for both the eyes and ears.  The Orchestre de Paris fly's through a beautiful version of Stravinsky's imaginative and challenging ballet score.  All the while set in the amazing architecture of the Louvre Pyramid the angles and arches a perfect background for the sharp twist and jagged turns of the music.

Having only seen the Louvre in person, I had no idea that it would sound as beautiful as it looks.  The acoustics of the room are spectacularly captured.  I must say that I am extremely envious of the audience sitting on the floor next to the orchestra that evening.  What a show they were privileged to see.  However, they were only able to see the performance once.  With this wonderful DVD I will be able to visit the Louvre and watch over and over again.",1275350400,7,1217,4.506849315068493
