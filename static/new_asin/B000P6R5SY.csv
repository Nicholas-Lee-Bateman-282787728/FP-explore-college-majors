2811866,3,B000P6R5SY,"""Vampire Secrets""  is a timely documentary in light of two recent theatrical films based on the vampire -- ""Twilight"" and ""Let the Right One In.""  It shows how history, nature, literature, cinema, and legend combined to produce the concept of the vampire, a creature of the undead who survives on the blood of human beings.  The 1997 Bram Stoker novel ""Dracula"" is cited as a major influence in the popularity of the vampire character.  The aristocratic Count Dracula requires a human slave to look after his coffin and protect him from exposure to daylight.  He leaves his Transylvanian castle to journey to London, its dense population an ideal feeding ground.  But the documentary goes further back, uncovering the ancient folkloric origins of blood-craving creatures from beyond the grave.  The vampire myth is traced to Eastern Europe and back to the ancient cultures of Greece and China.  Profusely illustrated with art and footage of actual locations, ""Vampire Secrets"" is a treat for anyone who ever shuddered watching a vampire flick.",1240704000,6,1043,5.1301775147929
2811867,4,B000P6R5SY,"What an awesome documentary!  It's packed full of stories and really separates the myths from the facts.  The interviews are very intriguing and the actors in the reenactments should get awards for their amazing portrayals!  I would give the documentary 5 stars if only it had even more content.  Yes, yes, it was a good hour and a half long, but I still was wanting more once it ended.

Oh, and one question:  anyone know who the sexy mysterious silent vampire man was played by?  Because I want to tell him that he can bite my neck anytime, hee hee.",1195344000,4,551,4.45

8189353,5,B000P6R5SY,"I love these kind of programs, so I could be a little biased, but I enjoy the legends, the stories behind it and the research. The History channel presents things in and interesting and engaging way and this DVD is no exception. I ordered this for my library because I enjoyed the program and want a personal copy for a time when it is no longer aired. As a writer I often find things like this inspiring and there are times when I just want to sit down and watch something creepy that crawled up out of the real world to become surreal.",1360972800,3,537,4.223300970873787
8189354,3,B000P6R5SY,The film was interesting and gave a board view.  The packaging was such that the dvd was not damaged and arrived as scheduled.,1360886400,,126,4.478260869565218
8189355,5,B000P6R5SY,"The dvd gave great info on the vampire legends,and culture of modern time. Could have explained a little on the vampire trappings and how they came about.",1357430400,,154,4.7407407407407405
8189356,2,B000P6R5SY,"I was disappointed in this video. While their showing of the places made famous by vlad the impaler,and bram's stoker's dracula was good,the video needed more. Yes,it can be said that the story of the female countess that bathed in blood was interesting. But,unfortunately,they talked about it over and over again. Some other stories of so called real vampires would have been better. Also,they mention diseases that have some characteristics of vampire lore,but seemed to pass right over that portion of the show. No secrets at all in this and any even casual vampire fan knows all this stuff. If I were you,I'd pass it by unless your a novice to vampires.",1347926400,2,657,4.875
8189357,3,B000P6R5SY,"Not bad, but waaaayyyyy too much time spent on the ""modern vampires"" at the end of the show.  Psychic Vampires?  Really?  History did a better job with its' other special on Vlad the Impaler, some of which is included on this DVD.",1329609600,5,230,4.428571428571429
8189358,5,B000P6R5SY,"How much fun can you have on Halloween?  A LOT when you watch this documentary on the history of vampires, peoples beliefs in them, etc.  As with all History Channel documentaries I always learn a lot, and would recommend this for anyone who is ""not of the faint at heart"".",1317081600,4,273,4.44
8189359,5,B000P6R5SY,This is a very interesting documentary informative as to where the origins of vampires came from. Brand new in the wrapping.,1316563200,,124,4.9523809523809526
