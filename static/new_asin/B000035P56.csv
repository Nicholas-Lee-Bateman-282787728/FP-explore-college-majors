1256972,3,B000035P56,"Prompt delivery of a DVD I thought would be better based on earlier videos I've seen of Super Dave - sorry, I felt let down with this one - seemed a little tired - still like Super Dave but the plot was not up to his usual funny standard.",1270080000,,238,3.877551020408163
1256973,3,B000035P56,"As big of a Super Dave fan as I am, I have to say I was a little disappointed in this movie. As with Mr. Bean, Super Dave's ""bit"" is at its best with short skits, and deviates from its genius in full-length movies.

There were some entertaining parts, but the movie frankly is not that good and can only be enjoyed by die-hard Super Dave fans. Regardless, it is Super Dave, and an average movie is better than no movie.",1262304000,,419,4.172839506172839
1256974,4,B000035P56,"This movie was really cute, I recall it being more funny when I was a youngun'",1242345600,,78,3.9375
1256975,4,B000035P56,"Intended as a movie, this was released staright to video. It's sort of a continuation of the Tv show. Some real belly laughs here and no doubt, this will please fans of the Super One. There is a plot here but most of the time, it doesn;t get in the way too much of the gags and laughs. Good fun!",1228003200,,295,3.933333333333333
1256976,4,B000035P56,"After having to sit through a plethora of poorly written, unimaginative, smug comidies for the past 15 years or so, Super Dave is a breath of fresh air.  Is it juvenile?  Sure.  It is predictable?  Yes - but if you don't at least smile when the Super One gets wiped out, in the words of Mark Twain, you were ""born an adult and never were a child.""  The movie suffers from the curse of being worked up from a 3 minute regular skit  on the old 80s Canadian TV comedy, ""The Bizarre Show,"" and the material does not lend itself to a full length movie, but it certainly does have some funny moments.  Speaking of lame, if you can make not just one, but a series of movies from the old ""Ernst"" TV commercials, Super Dave is due for a revival.",1149465600,5,736,4.177304964539007
1256977,4,B000035P56,"Hilarious stunts, slapstick humor, outrageous characterizations, and just good all around schtick makes this an extremely entertaining movie for the family.  The people who put this movie together realize that it was not intended for a cerebral study in filmmaking; it was meant to just flat out make you laugh. My wife and kids were just howling at various scenes ranging from the stinky lunch room to the slammy whammy infomercial.  We must have replayed that slammy whammy infomercial over 20 times, proving how kids can appreciate well written comedy. This movie is not for the prudes, snobs, or bores but definitely for the hip, open minded, slapstick in most of us.  Watch it with the family without any hesitation.",972345600,5,721,4.991666666666666
1256978,4,B000035P56,"This was a very funny movie, it had me rolling on the floor.  Even my mom laughed a little, and she hates the movies I like.  The story is Super Dave (Bob Einstien) is injured, and has to retire.  But DJ (Steve Van Wormer), a  kid he is training, steals his name and leaves him to work for Gil (Dan  Hedaya).  Well, Supe isn't going to really do anything about, but he meets  a single mom (Gia Carides), whose son needs an expensive operation, and he  falls in love.  So the Super One decides to come out of retirement and show  the world who the real greatest daredevil is.  Very entertaining, and the  direction is fun.  The DVD could have at least had the trailer on it,  though.  I really wish this movie had come out in theatres, because it  would have been great to see Super on the big screen.  Long live Super Dave  Osborne!",948412800,6,832,4.2243589743589745
1256979,4,B000035P56,"I thought it was a great movie.  Anyone who watches this film will laugh almost as much as they probably did when they watched the first Austin Powers movie.  Even if you have to clue who Super Dave is, it is still a  very funny movie.  I can't believe that this was never released in the  movie theaters.",947721600,5,305,4.189655172413793

1257005,4,B000035P56,"Super Dave Osborne, the clumsiest stunt man alive, returns for this movie. Those who watched cable in the 1970s and 80s may remember the man whose stunts never quite seemed to come off right, resulting in cartoonish consequences for Dave. In this movie Dave decides to retire but comes back thanks to a plot hatched by an unscrupulous promoter. Good for laughs, this is definitely a fun film!",1405814400,,392,4.779411764705882
1257006,5,B000035P56,"This is a really good movie.  Great guy humor and best of all, it's clean.  It was refreshing to get together with my buddies and laugh out loud without hearing F-bombs every 20 seconds.  Wish there'd been a sequel.",1403568000,,215,4.461538461538462

1257010,5,B000035P56,"If you're in to slapstick, if you remember Evel Kneivel and if you love the old Super Dave show from Showtime in the 1980s then watch this flick. It has all the old gags. Bob Einstein is as funny as ever.",1378857600,,204,4.0
1257011,1,B000035P56,The DVD was scratched and did not play all the way through. About halfway through the film it seized up and skipped a large part.,1336348800,,129,4.2

1257013,1,B000035P56,"OK, I laugh as just about anything including Super Dave skits but this was a poor attempt a movie.  Some funny spots but you will wonder if you can get your hour and a half back after watching this.  Those that ""really liked"" this movie must be promoting it because they have copies to sell.  Don't buy this if you are looking for the same level of humor as the old Super Dave skits.",1272153600,,383,4.148648648648648
