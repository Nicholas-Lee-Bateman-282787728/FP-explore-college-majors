8465132,3,B005CD24OK,"I am a big Ollie Lang fan and certainly learned something from this DVD, but it is antiquated.  Most, if not all, of the information on this DVD is now available on YouTube -- and I don't mean through copyright violation, I mean I've seen other videos by Ollie and other pro players making these same points.  That said, if you're serious about improving your game, then you need to be doing drills, and Ollie explains numerous drills that have helped him -- with the help of Kyle Spicka demonstrating one and two-person drills.  It's worth watching in the pursuit of excellence, but if you have limited funds, spend them on paint.",1409788800,,631,4.616071428571429
8465133,3,B005CD24OK,"Many will recognize my name. So I will be careful. I mean no disrespect to Oliver Lang.  I bought this video as an advanced woodsball player looking to glean anything new I can use in terms of technical skills.

I do many HOW TO videos on Youtube: DangerManXX is my channel. I've got but ONE favorite paintball player. Oliver Lang. His passion for the sport became more. He is something special. He has an understanding of the game that when you see him in the game - he mesmerizes you. He is that good.

Years ago I became a very good paintball player. I coveted my secrets.  Then a day came I realized it was time to share. To show others what I knew. I was hoping to find some of those secrets, SOME in this video. Instead this is a very straight forward training video for sup'air players.

Is that bad? Of course not. But if you already own a paintball training video, or are part of sup'air team, then this video won't expose anything you have not already learned or are learning.

IF you are new to the sport. Then BUY this video. Oliver Lang is a friendly warm and charismatic guy that teaches well.

For me, he didn't give me that nugget or two of secrets I was hoping for in this video. Perhaps another. Because for me, if he publishes a video, I'll buy it. I have that much respect for the guy.",1369872000,,1305,4.2591093117408905
