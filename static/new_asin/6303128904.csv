566597,5,6303128904,"What there is of a plot in this fabulous hokum takes a back seat to the Technicolor running riot, the sumptuous costumes and the Latin themed musical numbers that showcase Carmen Miranda, Alice Faye, John Payne and Cesar Romero. They're all mixed up in a scheme to keep a Macy's ""shopgirl"" (Faye) from suing a steamship company over her botched Havana vacation. The epitome of 40's Fox musicals is fast-paced, non-sensical and pure entertainment. Miranda practically steals the film with her performance as night club entertainer Rosita Rivas. Her musical numbers are hallucinatory visions of color and Latin rythyms that defined her brief but vibrant career. The DVD print is good and the mind-boggling Technicolor shines through near pitch perfect. My only complaint...the ""collectible lobby cards"". My copy came with an envelope labeled ""Lobby Cards"" with only one card inside. Surely we're not expected to keep buying the DVD until we collect them all. Confusing. Anyway, ""Week-end In Havana"" is a lot of fun for old film lovers and lovers of goofy but entertaining musicals. Enjoy.",1140566400,2,1086,5.176136363636363
566598,5,6303128904,"""Down Argentine Way"" may have started the series and made a star of Betty Grable, but I think ""Weekend in Havana"" is the movie that perfected the formula of the Technicolor ""south-of-the-border"" musical.  For once, everything (the eye-popping Technicolor, the songs, the jokes) seems to have fallen in the right place and the film is harmlessly entertaining from beginning to end.  Sure, Carmen Miranda is really Brazilian, Havana is basically portrayed as one big Hollywood studio nightclub, and the Latin couple is a comedic foil to the white leads, but you cannot expect too much political correctness from a 1941 Hollywood film.  The movie also doesn't have the sophisticated choreographies and camera movements of the best MGM musicals, but as far as entertainment value goes, this is as good or better than MGM.

Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda are both in top form all through the movie.  Faye, playing a Macy's girl vacationing in Havana, delivers her big number (the ballad ""Tropical Magic"") in a characteristic pose (resting on a veranda) but for once she doesn't play a suffering girlfriend.  She's funny and feisty and makes you wish Alice Faye had been allowed to play less passive roles in her other movies.  Miranda, as a nightclub singer, shows that she was an excellent comedienne, and she seems to be having a ball playing Cesar Romero's jealous and flirtatious girlfriend.  Cesar Romero and John Payne are easily upstaged by the female leads, but they're good as well (Romero in particular).

This is definitively the highlight of Fox's first round of ""Marquee Musicals."" And, unlike what another reviewer pointed out, ""Weekend in Havana"" is not at all like the many ""vaudeville""-inspired Technicolor musicals that Fox released throughout the 1940s.  Highly recommended.

About the DVD:  The film looked great, but a few comments: 1) the packaging favors Carmen Miranda over top-billed Alice Faye; 2) the liner notes have some mistaken info about Miranda (the same happens in Jeanine Basinger's superficial commentary track); 3) some stills on the menus belong to different movies (""Springtime in the Rockies"" and a Sonja Henie musical); and 4) there was only one ""lobby card"" included (the same happened with the ""Pin-Up Girl"" and ""Daddy Long Legs"" DVDs).",1139961600,2,2273,5.130081300813008

566600,5,6303128904,"""Weekend in Havana"" is one of the best in 20th Century Fox's winning formula of colourful wartime musicals set in exotic places, starting with ""Down Argentine Way"" in 1940. Glorious technicolour, a slight plot, a blonde singing and dancing star and Carmen Miranda were the ingredients and the formula spelt box office magic.

This one has Alice Faye in the comedic role of a common shopgirl on a dream holiday. Faye was not often given a straight comedy and she shines. Carmen Miranda and Ceasar Romero shine too.  Even John Payne is animated.  He plays very well against both Faye and Miranda in this one.  With the gleaming colour and costumes, Walter Lang's ""don't waste a moment"" direction and Fox's superb sound, we get a very entertaining musical.

The DVD print is spectacular and Janine Basinger's commentary captures accurately the context of the film, the box office appeal of the stars, the costumes, sets, musical direction and clever script which keeps the film moving so fast and with such wit.  In 1941, this was a tonic to the public. The other extras are not so good.  There are stills from the set, including at least one from a Sonja Henie film and another from the 1944 ""Greenwich Village"" - sloppy attention to detail.",1126656000,7,1239,4.788732394366197

566602,5,6303128904,"""Weekend in Havana"" might well be the fastest paced musical in the career of Alice Faye, whose films never lacked pacing.  Director Walter Lang makes adroit use of a gifted cast.  Alice Faye and John Payne ultimately fall in love under the bright stars of a Havana evening sky, but after plenty of resistance from spoiled rich girl Cobina Wright Jr., his fiancee.  Before she finds love with Payne, Alice is romanced by Cesar Romero at his comedic best as a gigolo perpetually in trouble.  Romero in turn is kept in line by regular girlfriend Carmen Miranda, a local nightclub singer and dancer who thinks nothing of bopping Romero to keep him in line.
The comedic highlight of ""Weekend in Havana"" is a hotel suite scene straight out of Noel Coward's ""Private Lines"" involving Faye, Payne, Miranda and Romero.  When the fiery Miranda calls Faye a ""floozy"" the blonde erupts with fire of her own.
The plot point of the film is that ship executive Payne, slated to marry boss' daughter Cobina Wright Jr., is compelled to obtain Faye's signature at all costs to avoid liability.  The Macey's woman's hosiery clerk Faye saw the negligent cause of the shipwreck of the cruise liner which was supposed to take her to Havana for two weeks of romantic enchantment.
In addition to clever, fast moving scenes, and some great musical numbers featuring the talents of Faye and Miranda, director Lang is able to utilize the comedic abilities of Romero, seeking to remain one step ahead of the mob and the law, along with tough mob boss Sheldon Leonard, restaurant entrepreneur Billy Gilbert, and hilarious hotel bellboy Leonid Kinsky, who has one of the funniest lines in the film.  With Faye being kept in the luxury suite by Payne to put her in a mellow mood prior to seeking her signature to sign off on all claims, the Macey's clerk gives Kinsky a dime tip.  Misunderstanding, Kinsky, in a script spoof of the rich, tells opportunistic Romero, ""From the size of her tip, she must be very rich!""",1011571200,21,1985,4.733333333333333
566603,5,6303128904,"This was such a great movie. Alice Faye is great, and naturally beautiful, I love her contralto voice. She was on the top of her game. She was the greatest musical comedy star. Too bad she's forgotten by most, most people don't know her, they find out about her through watching old movies of the 30s and 40s, a lot of people find out about her through Betty Grable, which is ashame because Alice Faye is more talented then Betty, no offense I love Betty Grable but, Alice is talented, it seems sometimes Betty Grable want you to pay attention to her body. Carmen Miranda is great as usual, both of them do good in this movie, no one steals the scene, Carmen Miranda has been known to steal a couple of scenes from Betty Grable But this movie, but Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda are great together, they both are equally talented, this movie is a symbol of why the 40s were so great.",1009756800,5,882,4.351515151515152

Passenger Nan Spencer (Alice Faye), a Macy's Department Store salesgirl from New York City, refuses to sign a waiver which would absolve the steamship company's liability in the accident........This colourful outing provided Faye with two good songs: TROPICAL MAGIC  &  ROMANCE AND RHUMBA.  Her third number, THE MAN WITH THE LOLLIPOP was recorded but cut from the film; however, it is heard briefly when Billy Gilbert sings a part of it at the country inn of which he owns.  For tongue-twisting, fruit-laden Carmen Miranda, this film showcased her talents considerably.  Hermes Pan choreographed her big production routine THE NANGO; she also sang the title tune, REBOLA A BOLA & WHEN I LOVE, I LOVE.

566715,3,6303128904,"While typically gaudy, lavish and tuneful,  ""Week-end in Havana"" doesn't have the sparkle and fizz, the glitzy pizzazz of its Fox stablemates of the time: ""Down Argentine Way"" and ""That Night in Rio"".  Alice Faye seems rather too mature a lady to be playing a ditzy shopgirl.  Betty Grable would have brought more youthful feistiness to the role.  And John Payne, a typical college nice guy, doesn't have the macho charisma of Don Ameche, the co-star in the other two musicals I've mentioned, to bring much vibrancy to his part.  Put  Payne and Faye together, and they're eclipsed by the exuberant Carmen Miranda and Cesare Romero, those reliable Latin-American stereotypes, who enliven the thin plot  in every one of their scenes.  Carmen, by now in her third screen appearance, was already trapped in the role of second=lead spitfire entertainer she would repeat again and again in over a dozen movies over the next ten years, never disappointing us with her always energetic and entertaining performances.  This is a lazily enjoyable entry in 20th Century Fox's output of musicals in the early forties.  Not one of the best, but still fun to see.",1350259200,,1149,4.9375
566800,4,6303128904,"This is a great showcase film for Cesar Romero and Carmen Miranda. Both have great comedic roles and they do a great job. Alice Faye and John Payne play their usual stock characters in a story full of cliches, but that's okay because they are both lovable eye candy. Alice is wonderful, singing Tropical Magic in her velvety 1940s alto voice. Carmen is still close enough to her Brazilian origins at this point in 1941 to add authenticity to her performance, especially in numbers like the Parrot song. For me the standout was Cesar Romero with his pitch perfect characterization and comedic timing. Of course, this was all done during a time when studios could still get away  with ridiculously unrealistic plots, cardboard sets and offensive ethnic stereotypes, but as long as you can cut them a little slack in this regard, you will enjoy this film.",1341360000,3,852,4.795918367346939
566801,2,6303128904,"The basic plot of this movie is a good one, except that they draw it out longer than necessary.

John Payne portrays the shipping magnate's future son-in-law who is sent to convince Alice Faye to sign a waiver of liability.  She refuses as she knows that the Captain was not fulfilling his duties that night.  So she ends up with a free trip to Havana.  Carmen Miranda has quite a few cameos, the reason for her fame being lost on today's audiences.  And Caesar Romero plays the ne'er do well Latin lover who woos Alice Faye for her supposed wealth.  It could have been a good film, but it just was too drawn out and then the important parts done too quickly to be a good movie.",1313193600,,814,4.281045751633987
566802,4,6303128904,"I'm relatively new to Alice Faye's work. Before 2010, the only thing I knew her from was the little bit in ""Four Jills In A Jeep"" when she sings her signature song, ""You'll Never Know"", but beyond that I hadn't really heard of her. Finding ""Week-End In Havana"" was an extremely pleasant surprise.

This movie isn't ground-breaking, but it's good time escapism. Seeing Cesar Romero without his Joker makeup and playing what was basically a hapless hustler was really fun. One of my favorite scenes involved Carmen Miranda chasing him around the Casino Roof. Ladies and gentlemen, it IS possible to run in platforms! Speaking of Carmen, she sparkles in this film (Think Lauren Graham talked fast on ""Gilmore Girls""? That was nothing.). Sure, Carmen's been made fun of quite a bit, but the lady had a very impressive way with comedy. Also, viewers of the original ""Miracle On 34th Street"" will recognize John Payne in this film. Quite honestly, his character is a bit nerdy at first and maybe a bit weak, but I enjoyed seeing him in another role besides Kris Kringle's defense attorney.

""Week-End In Havana"" may not be Alice Faye's best work, but it's enjoyable and not to be missed.",1297382400,,1181,4.784313725490196

566804,3,6303128904,"Sequels? Prequels?  In the old days, Hollywood just changed a few actors, re-wrote a few lines, changed the setting and added a few new dance numbers and Voila!  New Film!  This is factory film at its best!  Most of the crew from ""Song Of The Islands"" is here, but Grable has been ditched for  Alice Faye (Yahoo!) and Hilo Hattie for Carmen Miranda (Yahoo!)(and I love Hilo Hattie).  Instead of two yachtsmen drifting ashore in Hawaii, Faye's cruise ship runs aground off Cuba.  She saw the Captain where he shouldn't have been, and won't give in, so John Payne, agent for the shipping company (and soon to  wed the boss's daughter)  flies her to Havana, and escorts her the best he can.  Carmen Miranda shows up and wiggles and jiggles her way in and amongst the english language and big hats; and way too quick, you're at the big musical finale, which these films did so well.  One point here, look towards the lower center right screen for the male dancer who gets hopelessly lost.  All of his embarrassment shows up on VHS, only part of it on DVD.  Once again,  this ain't high cinematic art, but man o man, it's a highly watchable film, with great music and likeable characters.

566805,5,6303128904,"I recently acquired this film on DVD,one I hadn't seen in many years,for which I had alot of fond memories,and which to my delight hadn't lost a single bit of its' charm. In fact the print used here is very clean and crisp and enhanced the viewing pleasure. Furthermore the Fox production unit didn't hold back on it's use of colour which was deliberately quite eye catching.
The story here is pretty standard musical fare of the period. But with this film especially,it's the sum of all its' parts that add up to a VERY enjoyable viewing experience. John Payne is a steamship executive who is sent to get waivers from passengers aboard ones of its' ships run aground off the Florida coast. He gets every passengers' signature but one,Macy's shop clerk Alice Faye. On the steamship expense,she is flown directly to Havana and put up in the presidential suite of a posh hotel. Payne is all business and his attempts to show Alice ""a good time"" backfires. She's bored. Into the picture comes suave and debonair Cesar Romero. He thinks Alice is a wealthy American. He ""manages"" local singer Carmen but has always got a scheme on the side to make money;mostly in the gambling department,which has left him in debt to casino owner Sheldon Leonard. He hopes ""wealthy"" Alice will get him out of his debts. Much to Cesars' chagrin he slowly finds out there's no chance.
In steps Payne who agrees to slowly pay off Romero's  casino debts in exchange for his services in showing Alice a good time,in order to secure that all important waiver signature. Payne hasn't counted on the interference of Carmen who is quite jealous of Cesar's ""attentions"" towards any female,real or not,but especially Fayes'.The plot thickens with Payne getting involved as Carmen's new manager but in the process letting the cat out of the bag regarding his relationship with Romero. He becomes on the outs with both ladies until Payne and Faye get stranded miles from town and fall in love. Payne however is torn because of his betrothel to his sweetheart back in New York. Before he can come clean to Alice,his ""intended"" shows up to put a wrench into the proceedings. Payne and his fiance' fly back to New York but,as is his duty in these films,comes back happily to Alice in the end.
This picture,I understand,was a delight to make for all involved. All were to become fast friends on and off the set. The chemistry certainly shows on screen also. You will find that the film is edited beautifully and flows seamlessly from one scene to another and the 80 minutes brings the picture to too short an end. To me the highlight of this film is Carmen Miranda. Her energy and joie de vivre steal every scene in which she appears. She is in fine form in her beautful baiana and platform shoes,with those expressive eyes and flowing arms. She opens the movie and closes it nicely with fellow cast members.
The entire production is wonderfully choreographed by Fred Astaires' friend and working partner Hermes Pan who was having a very successful period with Fox.
The DVD comes with comes with the prerequisite trailer,audio commentary and photo gallery. However,enclosed with the movie are four collectible 5""X7"" repro lobby cards. A very nice touch.
In conclusion this film is not an intellectual mountain-to-climb nor a dazzling special effects barn burner;it is a plain and simple musical of the times. What puts it head and shoulders above many other films of the day however is the wonderful cast that has great chemistry and charm. Enhancing the proceedings are Payne,Faye and Miranda who all have their musical moments in which there is never a dull moment during its' 80 minute run.
I recommend it highly!",1225584000,,3678,4.792125984251968
566806,5,6303128904,"Fox channel ran this film right after ""Sun Valley Serenade"", both released in 1941. This emphasized to me that both musical romances had basically the same plot, but in very different exotic settings and with different lead actors, except for John Payne. In both films, Payne is engaged to be married to one knockout, but gradually comes to realize he prefers a newcommer, Alice Faye, in the present film. Whereas in SVS, Payne spends most of the film trying to deny that he is falling in love with Sonja Henje's character, who keeps popping up unexpectedly, in the present film, it's Payne who keeps popping up unexpectedly in the life of Alice, who initially shows no interest in him. Both films are blessed with multiple stars, with complementary and overlapping talents. As usual, Payne is the fall guy for a series of embarrassing  and comedic situations, can sing, and eventually winds up with the leading lady. Cesar Romero functions as the primary male comedian as well as something for the ladies to swoon over. Carmen Miranda is her usual effervescent  flirtatious self, as different in personality and looks from prim dreamy-eyed Alice Faye as one can imagine. She is the centerpiece of occasional lavish costume musical numbers, whereas Alice renders her ballads in quite a different style. While Romero makes a play for Alice, whom he thinks is filthy rich, and Carmen flirts with Payne, savvy viewers know that Carmen will return to Romero, while Payne and Alice will return together to NYC. Like SVS, this film is just fun, with a vaudevillian mix of song and dance, comedy, drama and romance.
  My DVD includes a very excellent commentary version by Jeanie Basinger, who enlightens us on the technical aspects of film making, as well as some background on the major stars. A background broshure and several postcards from the film were included.

566808,4,6303128904,"Week-End in Havana is enjoyable even if the plot is somewhat contrived. The film sports a great cast with Alice Faye, John Payne, Cesar Romero and Carmen Miranda. The choreography works well throughout the picture; all you have to do is watch those dance numbers with many dancers dancing simultaneously to know that they did work hard to stage those dance numbers. The cinematography reflects good judgment, too.

The action begins when a cruise ship to Havana, Cuba hits the rocks near Cuba and is disabled. All the passengers sign waivers and get arrangements for other trips--all, that is, except one Nan Spencer (Alice Faye). Nan saved like a fiend for this trip and she won't take no for an answer--she wants her vacation NOW! The cruise ship execs panic and even postpone a wedding so that one of their vice presidents, Jay Williams (John Payne), can fly down to Cuba. Jay eventually winds up giving Nan the vacation in Cuba she wanted to avoid her suing the steamship company.

Enter Cesar Romero as a gambler who romances Nan to get the big money he mistakenly thinks she has so he can pay off his gambling debts; Carmen Miranda fits in as the passionate, flighty nightclub singer who performs some solid numbers in this movie. While you watch this you might be able to predict what happens between Jay Williams, Nan Spencer and Jay's fiance Terry; but I'll leave all that out so that there won't be spoilers!

The DVD features some optional commentary which is great given the fact that movies from this era don't often offer this; and there is a small stills gallery as well.

Overall, despite a contrived plot twist or two, Week-End in Havana is a good Fox musical. Fans of the actors in this movie should get this for their collections.",1184457600,,1749,4.687296416938111

While skimpy, the plot of this very typical Fox musical is fairly efficient: Faye, a Macy's shop-girl, is the last holdout to sign off for liability when her cruise ship runs aground on a sand bar, so an executive of the cruise line (John Payne) has to squire her around Havana to make sure she has a good time. Along the way they run into an incompetent gigolo (Romero) and his spitfire girlfriend (Carmen Miranda, of course, since Brazil and Cuba were considered pretty interchangeable in the minds of 40s America). The costumes by Gwen Wakeling are quite eye-catching, and the lovely and unusual model Cobana Wright, Jr., plays Faye's rival, and John Payne is at least very handsome; unfortunately the sets and backdrops are pretty chintzy, as was often per usual with Fox, and the songs by Mack Gordon are instantly forgettable. The only thing to really lift this above mediocrity is Faye, who is not much of an actress (though she does have fun with a New York accent), but who sings like a dream.",1171584000,4,1329,4.683760683760684

To make her happy, he arranges for a trip to Havana and surprise: the two fall in love! Of course there are a number of twists and turns but we know they'll get together and we don't feel all that sorry for the boss' daughter. early in the story we know we're not supposed to like her. Viewers meet the hot Cuban singer/dancer Rosita Rivas performed by Carmen Miranda in all her glory and the lovable cad Monte Blanca played by Cesar Romero.

Part of the reason I love this film is it's just fun. The plot line is not complicated and we believe that a story that could easily be tawdry is innocent. The musical numbers may not be as well constructed as rival MGM would have done with the same story, but they still have an irresistible quality. Since most viewers will probably purchase the DVD to enjoy and not to over analyze, a corny story that can at times be a bit zany with musical numbers that are just enjoyable is great entertainment and WEEKEND IN HAVANA will be at home in any such collection.",1150416000,26,1646,4.483333333333333
566884,5,6303128904,"I'm an Alice Faye fan so it was great to see this restored print being released.  She did some 31 musicals in 12 years at Fox so I hope they reissue more of them.  A classy lady with a wonderful singing voice!

The technicolor images are bright and sharp so Carmen Miranda's costumes are spectacular, maybe even scene stealers.  I watched this on a DVD player that has HD resolution upscaling capabilities and the picture quality was very detailed for a film of that era (1941).

I played the film first then re-ran it with the voiceover commentary by a film historian, which was excellent.  I learned a great deal about the film, its actors, set design, costuming, the studio system, etc., etc.  This is a wonderful special feature addition to the DVD.

Costco currently offers the lowest price on this DVD that I have run across. Also, if you live in the LA area and know somone who works at the Fox studio you can get all of the Fox DVDs for even less at the studio store adjacent to the commissary.  I load up on them whenever I visit down there. If you can get an invite for lunch at the commissary dining room be sure to go as the food is excellent and the ""old Hollywood"" decor is fun.  One time when I was there Rupert Murdoch happened to be sitting at the next table.  (I think that was shortly after Ted Turner challenged him to a boxing match.)",1145145600,16,1355,4.337301587301587
566885,3,6303128904,"Weekend in Havana concerns a girl (Alice Faye) who saved for years in order to take a two week vacation from her job at Macy's. The cruise ship runs aground along some rocks and the trip is cancelled, but in order to avoid a lawsuit, the company offers a free vacation in a few weeks. The girl complains that she cannot do so because she will have to work, so the company flies her to Havana, all expenses paid to get her to sign a waver. The girl puts the representative from the company through all sorts of scenarios, but all she really wants is romance.

This film is done in Technicolor, but it hinders the film more than it helps it. Faye's skin looks dingy and chubby, much less beautiful than in her black and white films. She still shines through song, though, with her creamy voice and heavy eyelids. Carmen Miranda is a nuisance with her brash personality, garish face, and annoying nature.

There is an extra feature before the film: a deleted musical number from the Faye film Rose of Washington Square. Why it was included here instead of on the video of the film it came from, I don't know.",1143072000,2,1105,4.411764705882353
566886,4,6303128904,"Great, beamer-friendly image, nice cast and very witty dialogues. Musical Sequences are okay. Hilarious highpoint when Romero drops the cheque... Also the ending I found very funny, that is rare to end on a good line. Comes in slipcase + little booklet + an envelope with four lobby cards. I'm embarrassed to admit that one lobby card was double! So I received one that is missing in another customers DVD, as the other customers comments suggests :-(",1142899200,4,451,4.87012987012987
566887,2,6303128904,"In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda,  The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going. And make one yearn for Mickey and Judy.",1142121600,4,930,5.038961038961039
566888,4,6303128904,"Fox did a wonderful job on the DVD release of Weekend in Havana -- at least from a visual standpoint. The lush Technicolor photography looks almost as vivid and subtle as it did in 1941 -- and, if nothing else, makes you yearn for the other Technicolor musicals that Fox has oddly never released on DVD (most of Betty Grable's and Tryone Power's films, the big-budgeted Wilson, to name a few).  The only real annoyance is that the sound needed restoration -- it is wobbily and annoyingly off-key in the orchestrations and the credits. I'm not sure why Fox didn't bother cleaning it up, particularly when the picture is so wonderfully pristine.  Another complaint -- the Fox trademark is not the original used on the picture in 1941.  It is grainy and chopped on the sides -- just exactly like the one they used in their TV series in the 1960s and 1970s.  Once again it would have been a simple fix.  But I really don't want to complain -- please write Fox and beg them to bring the other Alice Faye, Betty Grable, and Maureen O'Hara Technicolor extravaganzas to DVD! They're sheer heaven -- particularly if they look this good.",1141776000,4,1127,4.587064676616915
566889,5,6303128904,"When Fox upgraded from Studio Classics to Cinema Classics brand, they upgraded the price too.  What you get are a larger booklet insert, four ""lobby cards"" and a slipcase.  This title, ""Daddy Long Legs"" and ""Week-End in Havana are each missing 3 of the 4 lobby cards.  Twentieth Century Fox is aware of the problem, but offers no replacement for defective packages.

Other than that, the film is great, and it's wonderful these Grable classics are being released.",1140825600,2,463,4.897435897435898
