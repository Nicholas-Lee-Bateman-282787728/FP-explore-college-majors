4239781,5,B00406UJZG,"I'd say if you're a newbie at classic films and want to see what has made this team remembered over the years, these are their four best joint efforts. There are two collections of Astaire and Rogers films already being sold by Warner Brothers that have all of their films, if you're interested. However, the films at the beginning and end of their partnership aren't nearly as good as these. At the beginning of their careers you have two films - ""Flying Down To Rio"" (1933) and ""Roberta"" (1934) that don't even star the pair. Instead they are supporting players trading smart remarks and only doing a couple of numbers. Their last film at RKO ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" is rather ironic because today if people remember the Castles at all it is because Astaire and Rogers played them. The two are a close happily married couple throughout and it is just missing something without the sexual tension and comic mix-ups of their other films. Their last pairing ""Barkleys of Broadway"" is actually an MGM musical in the MGM tradition, so it is not really typical of what the two did at RKO either.

I'd recommend this set if you're not an Astaire/Rogers completist nor think you may become one.",1291420800,81,1203,4.647887323943662
4239782,5,B00406UJZG,"This new boxed set from TCM is a fantastic way to begin collecting the films of Fred and Ginger for those who have yet to experience the magic of Fred and Ginger. It was the touch of finger tips, a hand on the waist, a longing look and a smile, and a graceful spin; it was Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, making love while they danced into our hearts and stayed there. It was elegance and charm, a romantic screen teaming like no other. Fred and Ginger gave the country a boost and a bit of hope in dire times, and made a collection of funny and romantically elegant dance musicals that have never been surpassed as film entertainment. There was magic when they danced, and charm when the talked to each other. Here are four great ones for you to enjoy.

THE GAY DIVORCEE

Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers gave everyone something to smile about for a couple of hours during the depression with a special blend of magic that can never be repeated. Their films were sophisticated and charming, elegant and romantic, and most of all, funny. The Gay Divorcee is a gorgeous production from Pandro S. Berman. A fine screenplay from George S. Martin, Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman, based on the novel by Dwight Taylor, helped this wonderful film garner 5 Academy Award Nominations, including one for Best Picture.

The chemistry between Astaire and Rogers lights up the screen during their dance numbers, a romantic yet innocent longing to fall in love in each graceful step and touch. A great supporting cast that includes Alice Brady, Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, and Erik Rhodes add many laughs to this Mark Sandrich directed screen classic. Cole Porter's, Night and Day, is one of the most popular songs ever recorded. The Continental, a song not in Porter's origional Broadway show, but written for the film, won an Academy Award. The musical adaptation from the stage to film was by Kenneth Webb and the great Samuel Hoffenstein.

The story revolves around Mimi Glossip (Ginger Rogers) and her kooky aunt. Alice Brady is a hoot as Hortense, guiding Mimi through her divorce from geologist husband Cyril (William Austin). Guy Holden (Fred Astaire) can't forget the lovely Mimi after he ""rescues"" her from a snagged dress but she wants nothing to do with him. He searches all over London for her and finally catches up with her after a car chase and immediately decides they should marry. Mimi endeavors not to let herself be charmed by Guy while her aunt arranges for an attorney to aid in her efforts to free herself. The attorney is Guy's good pal, Egbert ""Pinky"" Fitzgerald (Edward Everett Horton), the black sheep of his family. Neither Mimi or Guy is aware of the coincidence, however, which creates a hilarious situation when Pinky arranges for her to have a correspondent in an effort to get her divorce.

Erik Rhodes nearly steals the film as the correspondent, Rodolpho Tonetti, whose motto is: ""Your wife is safe with Tonetti. He prefers spaghetti!"" A secret phrase he is instructed to say to Mimi for identification as the correspondent, is one Pinky has overheard his pal Guy say. When Tonetti can't quite remember it, and doesn't have a description of Mimi, you can guess what happens. Most of the fun takes place at a beautiful seaside resort, filled with all the glossy sets RKO could muster, which were considerable at this juncture. Eric Blore is the waiter who will spill the beans and allow Fred and Ginger to dance their way to happiness for the first time. Along the way, there is humor and charm, and a 17 minute sequence of The Continental which alternates between the easy grace of Fred and Ginger and a sparkling dance with practically everyone.

No other couple in film history has ever made love to each other during a dance like Fred and Ginger. Their charm and elegance let people imagine, if only for a couple of hours, that love and heaven existed still, and fostered the notion they were one and the same. Happiness filled the screen and allowed moviegoers to escape for a short interval from hard times, and give them hope that something better was just around the corner. The Gay Divorcee was the beginning of an elegant magic Fred and Ginger would share with us all, until they finally felt it was time to say goodbye. But they never really have to say farewell as long as we have these wonderful film treasures, reminders, of both them, and the romantic innocence we once had.

SWING TIME

The easy elegance and fluid grace of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers blend perfectly with the romantic music of Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields in this most charming of stories, produced by Pandro S. Berman and directed by George Stevens. Erwin Gelsey wrote the story and Howard Lindsay and Allan Scott contributed the screenplay to the film Ginger always pegged as her favorite of the 10 she and Fred made together. ""Swing Time"" is charming perfection, and a reminder of just how wonderful the movies can be.

George Stevens gave ""Swing Time"" a romantic glow with the use of snow and the never to be forgotten ""Never Gonna Dance."" The bittersweet six minute sequence of ""Never Gonna Dance"" is one of the most romantic ever filmed. Fred and Ginger shot 48 takes before they were completely happy with it. Ginger is lovely beyond words in gowns by Bernard Newman, especially in this scene. ""Never Gonna Dance"" was actually the working title of the film.

John ""Lucky"" Garnett (Fred Astaire) is a dancer and gambler on his way to marry Margaret Watson (Betty Furness). His pal Everett ""Pop"" Cardetti (Victor Moore) knows it's the end for the troupe if this happens, so he and the boys pull a gag about cuffs that leaves Lucky without pants! Lucky misses the wedding, of course, but the very pretty and sincere Margaret is willing to forgive him. Her dad gives him a chance to redeem himself if he can go to New York and earn 25,000 dollars and prove his worth.

He and Pop run into redheaded dance teacher Penny Carrol (Ginger Rogers) on the street and the smitten Lucky spends the rest of the film trying not to earn the money so he won't have to go back and marry Margaret. There is a lot of charm as Lucky saves Penny's job at the Gordon Dance Academy by showing the owner (Eric Blore) how much she has taught him in only a few minutes! Pop hits it off with her pal Mabel (Helen Broderick) and offer support as Lucky tries not to fall for the sweet Penny.

Lucky must battle band leader Ricardo Romero (Georges Metaxa) for Penny's hand when he discovers to his glee that Margaret doesn't want to marry him either. Scenes such as an unseen kiss by Fred and Ginger behind a door, the rendering of ""A Fine Romance"" in the snow, and a last second, delightful surprise for Fred and Ginger fans, which takes place in front of a beautiful bay window as the snow falls, all make this film an exquisite delight.

The lovely ""The Way You Look Tonight "" won the Oscar as Best Song, and Hermes Pan was nominated for his work as Dance Director for Astaire's astounding ""Bojangles of Harlem"" number. Fans often go back and forth as regards ""Swing Time"" and ""Top Hat"" as to which one was the couple's best film. The truth is, they were all wonderful, and there was something to love about them all. My personal favorite is ""Carefree."" ""Swing Time"" happens to be my daughter's favorite. Which only goes to show how timeless these true classics are.

TOP HAT

A merry Dwight Taylor story, this time adapted as a screenplay by Taylor himself and Allan Scott, gave Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire another chance to shine in this elegantly crafted Pandro S. Berman production, directed by Mark Sandrich. Lyrics and music by Irving Berlin and some truly lovely gowns created for Ginger by Bernard Newman, make this Fred and Ginger outing as pleasing to the eyes as it is to the ears. Their's was a style and grace that passed only once this way, and we shall never see anything like it again as long as our planet keeps spinning.

The three wonderful character actors from ""The Gay Divorcee,"" Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, and Erik Rhodes, are joined this time around by Helen Broderick, giving a deft touch to this fun and zany story which was as good an excuse as any for Fred and Ginger to sing and dance the Irving Berlin tunes. It is Eric Blore this time who steals every scene he's in as Horton's quite odd little manservant, Bates. Just as in Deanna Durbin's ""Lady on a Train,"" Edward Everett Horton will somehow manage to get a black eye!

Jerry Travers (Fred Astaire) is meeting Horace Hardwick (Edward Everett Horton) at the stuffy Thackery Club to talk about starring in his new show. Horace's wife, Madge (Helen Broderick), has plans to set up the single Jerry with her girlfriend Dale Tremont (Ginger Rogers). The meeting will be in Italy, but by chance, his dancing wakes up the prety girl below Hardwick's suite, who just happens to be Dale. From the moment she comes to complain about his dance affliction, Jerry is smitten, pouring sand on the floor to dance her lightly to sleep.

Jerry pursues her, not knowing at first who she is. His posing as a horsedrawn cab driver with an accent is one of the amusing scenes in his pursuit of his dream girl. Both he and Dale get caught in a storm and find shelter under a gazebo, where the couple share one of their finest and most romantic moments ever, to Irving Berlin's ""Isn't This a Lovely Day to Get Caught In the Rain?"" Later in the story, they will get to dance ""Cheek to Cheek.""

Another only in the movies mix-up causes Dale to think Jerry is Madge's husband, Horace, bringing about a confused, and twice slapped, Jerry. Horace, of course, has never seen Dale before, and sends his crazy little manservant Bates to follow her around Italy once they arrive, thinking she is out to trap his pal Jerry. Dale tells her friend Madge about the incident, of course, and more fun follows as Dale tries hard not to fall for Jerry, who she thinks is her best friend's husband.

Not to be forgotten in this merry mess is Erik Rhodes, as fashion desiner Alberto Beddini, using Dale as a model for his creations. Dejected at the situation, Dale will marry Beddini, causing no end of frustration and hilarity as Jerry has figured out by this time what is going on. Madge hasn't, and gives Horace a black eye! Can Jerry get Dale to unload her new husband Beddini once everything is cleared up and she is free to love him? Will he even need to? Don't forget, the wildly eccentric Bates, who refers to himself as ""we"" has been shadowing Dale all over Italy!

The glossy RKO sets match the elegance and beauty of Irving Berlin's songs, giving the public another big dose of what it needed as the country recovered from the great depression, which wasn't so great at all. You don't have to wear white tie and tails while watching this marvelous film, but you'll almost wish you were, so you could be up there with Fred and Ginger and enjoy a style of romance that shone brightly, but passed ever too briefly in American film.

SHALL WE DANCE

The beloved ""Shall We Dance"" was the only Fred and Ginger film with songs from George and Ira Gershwin, and they were splendid. Songs like ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" made for great entertainment when coupled with the opulent RKO sets in this Pandro S. Berman production. This lively tale of mix-ups and misunderstandings was from a screenplay by Allan Scott and Ernest Pagno, based on an adaptation by P.J. Wolfson of a story by Lee Loeb and Harold Buchman. Ginger's gowns by Irene were fabulous as always and Mark Sandrich once again took the helm.

On his stay in Paris, Pete (Fred Astaire), a famous ballet dancer also known as Petrov, wants to meet musical comedy star Linda Keene (Ginger Rogers), and in fact, would like to marry her! Pete and his pal Jeffrey (Edward Everett Horton) discover she's sailing on the S.S. Queen Anne and follow her. Pete uses a fake accent for a short time but is eventually found out, and finds out that dogs are the way to a girl's heart.

A wild story Jeffery told Lady Tarrington (Ketti Gallian) in Paris comes back to haunt Pete, as suddenly everyone on the cruise thinks he and Linda have been secretly married, and are going to have a baby! It's a bit much for Linda, who has sworn off reporters, and they decide to really get married, so they can get divorced. But it's too late for Linda, as she has fallen in love with the pursuing Pete, and there is a sadness as Pete sings ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" on a ferry to Manhattan after it's all done. The tune was nominated as Best Song but lost the Oscar to ""Sweet Leilani"" from ""Waikiki Wedding.""

Hilarious moments in the film include Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore in a ""hushing"" duel with ballet patrons, Horton and Jerome Cowan getting tight, with Horton getting ill afterward, and Fred convincing Horton that he's seasick, even though the water is perfectly calm. Blore ends up in jail for the second time in one of the couple's pictures and is once again a riot.

Ginger sings ""They All Laughed"" and she and Fred share a lovely dance that culminates with a smile, as the couple sit on a piano. A fun and famous scene has them on skates in the park, dancing to ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off."" Fred's character Pete wants to dance with Linda all his life, but what's he to do when she won't consider it? Dance with images of her, that's what. A charming conclusion has Linda joining the other girls, but Pete can't figure out which is the real Linda. Will Linda say yes to Pete? If you are a fan of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers you know the answer to that one!

Devoted fans of one of the most fondly remembered couples in screen history might be shocked to learn that during production, there were plans for this to be their final film. ""Swing Time,"" their previous entry, now widely regarded by film historians, along with ""Top Hat,"" as the zenith of their films together, had done huge box office business in large cities upon its initial release. But that business had quickly subsided and there were those at RKO who felt they had gone to the well once too often.

Fortunately for us, that theory was squashed, and we got to see the hilarious ""Carefree"" and the tender ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" before the couple said farewell. Again, fortunately, we don't have to say farewell, only ""see you later,"" because we now have the ability to watch these wonderful films at home whenever we want. ""Shall We Dance"" is a charming reminder of a magic that passed this way only once, and something you'll want to capture forever.

Lots of goodies, already listed in the product description, accompany this one. This new boxed set from TCM is a nice way to get acquainted with Fred and Ginger, and begin your long love affair.",1284163200,43,14762,4.5827965138309965

4239786,5,B00406UJZG,"The years 19341937 were abysmal for most, buried in the Great Depression, but they were golden for Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. One year after another, they gave us the films for which they remain best remembered. ""Top Hat"" (1935; music and lyrics by Irving Berlin) is the quintessential Astaire-Rogers movie. ""Swing Time"" (1936; music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Dorothy Fields) offers the most varied dance numbers. ""Shall We Dance"" (1937) is the film set to music by the Gershwin brothers. ""The Gay Divorcee"" (1934) is the weakest among this set of four, but, really, how weak can any musical be that gives you Cole Porter's ""Night and Day""? Taken all in all, this is a timeless collection. Until recently it was priced in the $10  $20 range. At this writing it's available new on the secondary market for around $50, and that is a terrible shame. The owner of these films should reissue this set at an affordable price right now.

For those out there who have never seen these classicsI'm looking at you, youngstershere's an approach to these films. First, forget the stories: they are the thinnest of clotheslines on which to hang the dance numbers. For this reason scene selection was created on DVD. Second, the comedy is innocent, broad, and has not dated well. The reason to see and treasure these films is to watch Fred and Ginger flirt, court, and make love by dancingharmonious, graceful, blissful love. Balanchine compared Astaire to Bach in artistry, inventiveness, and elegance. Rogers was his perfect partner (who, it has been famously said, did everything he did but in heels while dancing backward). Along the way Astaire introduced to the public more standards of the Great American Songbook than anyone else, because their studio, RKO, hired the best American songwriters of the twentieth century. The evidence is here on these four discs. Although many of this set's extrasoriginal trailers and so forthare in sad shape, Turner Classic Movies has tried to give us a night at the cinema the way we would have known it ca. 1935. The movies themselves have been well restored. How fortunate we are still to have themand, if we are lucky enough to own them, to see them whenever we wish.

Politically if not economically I feel as though America is now undergoing a Second Great Depression. Fred and Ginger pulled our parents and grandparents through the first. The sheer joy of watching A & R dance may yet pull us and our children through the second.",1508976000,2,2473,4.827830188679245

4239791,4,B00406UJZG,"I was born in 1969 and my parents were never great movie goers nor did they ever seek out older movies that they really enjoyed. I probably heard my mom occasional remark about Astaire and Rogers on occasion but I was not once slightly interested. Fast forward 35 years and I watch Holiday Inn and White Christmas every 2-3 years during the holidays regularly and it peaked my interest into what made Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers so special? This collection provided an easy way to find out. While their movies aren't really my overall cup of tea I and my wife found ourselves enjoying the breezy high class elegance and frequent clash of manners that these films (all with practically identical plots, just mildly tweaked, and pretty much the same actors playing the same characters!!!) provide. It feels like classic Hollywood, like a dream that was, like a world that can never be. For me Fred Astaire is the star and his funny face is the complete opposite of a dashing leading man like Cary Grant; his knock-kneed determination and general zest always makes him a likable character. Ginger Rogers never seems to dance in the films as much as I imagined she would; she often plays a bit of an aloof spitfire who succumbs to Astaires genial determination. This collection of four movies is probably a nice intro to those like me who wanted to dip their toes in the dancing pond a little deeper, but nothing on here comes close to comparing to the greatness of Holiday Inn or White Christmas.",1503273600,,1496,4.670454545454546

4239877,5,B00406UJZG,These older films are what I live for.. This is a great collection..,1452556800,,68,4.3076923076923075
4239878,5,B00406UJZG,"First, I must note... I ordered the ""TCM Greatest Classic Film Collection: Astaire & Rogers (Volume 1) (The Gay Divorcee / Top Hat / Swing Time / Shall We Dance)"" DVD through Amazon, not another seller. If you have enough items in your cart to qualify for Free Shipping. I recommend that you don't select it, since it took over two weeks to ship this DVD from Amazon's ""warehouse"". However, I must also note, that I was NOT charged for the DVD, until it shipped. I also ordered the Astaire & Rogers (Volume 2) DVD from Amazon as well, at the same time, and oddly enough, it shipped right away. I had to wait two weeks to start watching that, since I wanted to watch all eight movies in the order that Fred and Ginger made them. I should rate FOUR stars for this wait... However... That has nothing to do with this DVD itself...

When the DVD finally arrived, the packaging was in excellent condition, and I was quite surprised. The Packaging came with FOUR DVDs, each with their own Disc Art, instead of the TWO DVDs, as advertised. The DVD case also came with a spindle that held all four DVDs. This packaging version was just like the Volume 2 DVD. I have now resorted all 8 movies into the order that Fred and Ginger made them.

I have not watched all of the movies yet, and I still have ""Shall We Dance"" Vol 1. ( & The ""Barkleys of Broadway"" Vol 2. ) to watch yet, but the picture quality of the six that I have watched have been excellent.

All of the films have been wonderful so far, and Fred & Ginger have lived up to the fabulous reviews that so MANY others have said about the two. In fact, after watching them dance, I find it hard to believe how perfect they were. In a few of their dances, they were dancing over stairs and tables and other objects, near the edges of the theater stages, without any hesitation or stumbles. It makes one wonder, how many takes it took them to get it right, and how many bruises they both got before the final takes that are show in the films. In fact, in one of films, ""Swing Time""?, I think, Sorry, I can't remember exactly... Ginger takes a few falls on purpose, which seem almost as if they were for real... So much so, that during one fall, when Ginger lands on her rear... You can clearly see that she bounced. So you know, she went home that night and was sore... How she did this on purpose without really hurting herself is a mystery to me. That's how good she was.

Ginger was truly gifted in every movie she was in, and in these movies she truly shines. From Dancing, to Singing, to Acting, and so on. You truly believed she fell in love with Fred in every movie. Even in one of the films, where Fred sings to her about how beautiful she looks, from another room, while she washes her hair. She becomes so enchanted, that she comes into the room with soap still in her hair, and forgets all about that, until Fred turns around and looks at her strangely. She looks into a nearby mirror, Sees her soapy hair, and runs away from him and back into the other room, all embarrassed.

And of course, with Ginger being such an amazing & beautiful woman, Fred realistically falls in love with her in every film too... Who wouldn't!

While there are few spontaneous & unrealistic scenes in these films, where they just go into music & dance sequences for no logical reason, most of the rest do seem to be as a result of being in musicals or dancing to an orchestra, or something like that. And every piece, even the unrealistic ones, still perfectly fits into the plot of the film and so forth. While Fred telling Ginger how beautiful she looks, or dancing with her ""Cheek to Cheek"", or even Ginger singing to Fred about her feelings, I can't find any reason why anyone would not find something to enjoy about these films.

If you don't have this set, or Volume 2, I highly recommend that you add them to your collection. You shouldn't be disappointed.",1452124800,3,3899,4.3401920438957475
4239879,5,B00406UJZG,"Who couldn't love Fred Astaire? He and Ginger Rogers are probably the best known of any dance partners ever in the movies. He never minded playing the guy who met the girl but lost her through a mishap, or a series of mishaps, then dancing his way back into her heart and all the way to the end of the movie. He's one of the smoothest dancers ever. He was so graceful. Just a pleasure to watch in these movies. And Ginger Rogers was the perfect partner for him.

4239895,3,B00406UJZG,"This collection is OK for the price, and my planned infrequent watching of the included movies. The movies have been poorly remastered, resulting in  barely adequate image quality. I've several other Warner/Turner produced DVDs of movies from the 1930's that have been remastered to a much higher standard, and I enjoy each screening. Since I'll only watch these Astaire/Rogers movies once or twice over the next 5 years, I'll keep the collection. However, if I had a greater interest in Astaire/Rogers, I'd return the collection and search for one that's of higher quality.

My collection came with each movie on its own disc, and that's a plus. The downside is that two had scratches, probably neglect when placing all four movies on one spindle... again not unexpected given how cheap the set is.",1443139200,,799,5.0

4239922,5,B00406UJZG,"This is one of the best collection of musicals that TCM has produced. Loving musicals I enjoyed each one of these exquisitely restored RKO films with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Perhaps, TCM placed these in volume 1 for being considered the best in the series. In fact, I strongly believe that this is the best group of musicals of the thirties. In my opinion, Sandrich does with the musical what I think no one could have done during this period: weaving the screwball comedy with the musical in an effective manner. Sandrich directs these films except Swing Time, which was directed by George Stevens. Sandrich's films are welll-structured, accommodating the songs and the dance sequences in a very effective manner. Under Sandrich, these predictable plots move in a cohesive manner and with precision. In addition to this, producer Hermes Pan invites the best song writers of the period. Irving Berlin contributes his music and lyrics to Top Hat, Jerome Kerns does the same for Swing Time, George and Ira Gershwin make their debut with Shall We Dance, and a Cole Porter song makes way into The Gay Divorcee (the first film in this group chronologically). Moreover, it seems that RKO spent lots of money on art deco settings that embellish each one of these films.

In The Gay Divorcee (1934), it is enjoyable to watch the first funny encounter between Astaire and Rogers. In this musical Astaire sings and dances a beautiful song, A Needle in A Haystack. Astaire and Rogers dance to Cole Porter's Night and Day and Magidson and Conrad's the Continental. This is accompanied by a dance ensemble that is equal to anything done by Busby Berkley.

In Top Hat (1935), the plot may seem similar to the previous film, but other than the actors, the witty dialogue and the situations are fresh. Even the way confusions are created is quite unique. Sandrich must have been really good at doing this. Although one does see great dancing in The Gay Divorcee, Fred Astaire's tap-dancing in Top Hot tops whatever he has done before this. I enjoyed watching Astaire gunning down a chorus with a cane as he tap-dances Top Hat, Whites Ties and Tails in Top Hat. In this film, I also had the opportunity to watch Astaire and Rogers dance to the tune Of Berlin's Cheek to Cheek, a very sensual dance that leaves Rogers a little flushed. Then they dance to The Piccolino, again accompanied by a dance ensemble that rivals any of Berkley's choreographs.

In Shall We Dance (1937), the last in this group directed by Sandrich, the songs are written by George and Ira Gershwin. The plot is unique since it is about an American dancer - who uses a Russian artistic name, Petrov, while his real name is Pete Peters - who falls in love with Rogers (Linda Keene). Again, another perfect combination of screwball and musical. I think this is the second best in this group after Top Hat. Among my favorite numbers is Astaire's performance to Slap the Bass dine along with machinery, Rogers' vocal performance of They All Laughed (at Christopher Columbus), Astaire and Rogers' first dancing duet with the music to that same song, and their roller-skate routing with ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off."" I also found quite fascinating a back-bend routine done by a classical ballet dancer of this period called Harriet Hoctor who appears at the end of this film.

Finally, there is Swing Time (1936), directed by George Stevens. This is the film that takes longer to begin. I get to see Astaire and Rogers dance together for the first time almost after 30 minutes into the movie. Nevertheless, once they begin, it is pure musical. My favorite numbers here are Pick Yourself Up, A Fine Romance, Bojangles of Harlem, and Never Gonna Dance. In my opinion, Bojangles of Harlem is quite exceptional in this group. As screwball, I don't believe it is as effective as Sandrich's films. Rogers and Astaire hit it off right away and the plot does test my willingness to disbelieve as I see Astaire winning a casino through card-playing. The beginning, which shows how Astaire is duped from marrying, and a repetition of this at the end of the film is just plain silly. Nevertheless, Astaire and Rogers are the movie itself, so everything is tolerable.

This collection comes in individual discs and commentaries. It is one of the best TCM collections.",1431907200,8,4316,4.795698924731183

Yes, the plots are predictable, the scenarios unlikely, and the rapidity in which Fred falls in love is slightly disturbing, but they are so good-natured that you love them anyway. It is interesting to see how some of the music has worn so well over the past 70 years (especially the Gershwin numbers) while others are hopelessly dated (The Piccolino? Really?). And the dancing, well, I don't even need to mention that. I could watch the Cheek to Cheek sequence on loop and never cease to be amazed by the beauty of the dancing.

4240016,5,B00406UJZG,"This is what black and white film was made for.... Dazzling cinematography, sets and wardrobe. While they are all fantastic I love Swing Time and their last dance scene of the movie where they dance up a glossy black double return staircase one on each side while the camera pans from first floor to the second all, but the very last, in one breath taking take. It supposedly took 48 takes and her feet were bleeding but she wanted to finish the number as it was near midnight. While these films are all a bit plot thin and silly the first two are the most, but they are also the most production rich. Amazing sets and big dance numbers with lots of extras. While Astaire and Rogers do seem to have a real chemistry they don't seem to fit. He is no leading man but she is most definitely a leading lady. Not so much from her acting which is always fine but her incredible style. I personally find his dancing (at this time) very jerky. He often looks like he's attacking the floor and his hand fly all over with no grace. Ginger does the same steps and makes them beyond graceful. its interesting to see the contrast. much has been made of the fact that she really wasn't a dancer.  She was filming other movies while Fred was planning these pictures. She didn't even learn the numbers with him. She practiced between her other movies with Hermes Pan for these pictures. All the more reason to give her more credit than she gets.  Her acting is typical of the period and become more natural as time goes by. She has very expressive eyes and mouth. She also has much broader shoulders than Astaire!! Astaire himself is the same in every move I've seen except his last films like On the Beach. A very likeable guy, great dancer. This genre of film is at its zenith in Broadway Melody of 1940. With Astaire and Eleanor Powell. The same type of film, black and white like you've never seen it before, and Powell is a dancer that exceeds Astaire's talent. She was unfortunately a bit flat as an actress. But this is a direct descendent of the Astaire-Rogers films and is really more successful. the dance numbers are out of this world. But back to this set. The music is from the best composers of the day but as neither star could really sing they are not as powerful as you might think. To hear the same 'standards' from a real singer, well the contrast is amazing they suddenly become amazing classic songs. In these movies the really don't shine. Latly these film are definitely not digitally restored. They are fine to look at but I've seen them on Turner Classics with much better clarity. These look like good but old film. Also the sound quality is below average. Its a shame they didn't bother to polish these up a bit more as theres been nothing like them before or since and they define 'classic movie'.",1381968000,5,2809,4.441860465116279

4240028,5,B00406UJZG,"If you are fond of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, it's a no-brainer.  I can't get enough of seeing the duo dance together in the early years, when Ginger was young, thin, driven to dancing for the love of it.  I have remarked to others that then, I get the impression that Ginger got almost an erotic thrill out of dancing with Astaire.  And I believe that it was more than mere acting on her part.  The prime example of this is the scene in which Astaire and Rogers are on roller skates in the park rink.  That scene had to be shot 49 times before it was fully satisfactory.  At the end of that time, Ginger Roger' feet were bleeding; but she did not cry or make a big fuss.  that demonstrated not only her compulsive dedication, but her profound infatuation with what she was doing.  Astaire had a God-given gift; he was a natural dancer, and did so professionally for over 70 years.  Ginger Rogers was introduced to vaudeville by her show biz mother and started dancing professionally on the stage at age 17.  She was a star.  Picturre perfect !",1373673600,3,1049,4.383419689119171

4240040,5,B00406UJZG,"These are four great musicals which have set the standard of American Movie Musicals. This standard is so high that it is rarely reached, much less passed.  Fred Astaire is superb as always.  It is interesting that an ""ugly"" man who was all leg, could have become through dancing, singing and acting, a great star. In these four movies he is amply supported by Ginger Rogers, stiff shouldered and always pouting as required by the scripts.  The dancing is wonderful with great production numbers, ""The Continental"" and ""The Piccolino"" from Gay Divorcee and Top Hat respectively being top notch, though ""The Piccolino"" wins because of better lyrics.  The four movies, The Gay Divorcee (1934) 105 mins., Shall We Dance (1937) 109 mins., Swing Time (1936) 104 mins., and Top Hat (1935) 100 mins., feature Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore as sidekicks and comic relief.  Horton is always funny with his ""delayed take"" which he uses like a virtuoso in virtually every scene.  Blore, usually the butler or the manager of the hotel, is equally always funny, a living representation of P.G.Wodehouse's impossibly upper class British butlers. Wonderful! In typical Hollywood fashion, they managed to leave out most of Cole Porter's score from Gay Divorcee except for the enchanting ""Night and Day"" song and dance. Shall We Dance has an excellent score and wonderful lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin. The ""dog walking"" music alone would suffice to make this a great musical.  Swing Time by Jerome Kern and Dorothy Fields is racist by our standards, but the score and lyrics are standard setters just like the Porter, Gershwins and Berlin efforts. Top Hat is perfect, perfect score, perfect lyrics, perfect performances, perfect nonsense, and just as enjoyable now as originally during a similar time of economic difficulty--then the great depression, now--now.  Nothing will take the mind off life better than any one of these four movies.",1369612800,4,1934,5.078864353312303

4240050,5,B00406UJZG,"Even though these movies came out 80 years ago, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers are still considered the greatest dance team of all time.  When you see these movies you will understand why.

I don't own this particular set.  I bought the Astaire and Rogers Collection - Volume 1 before this one came out.  I wish I bought this instead.  This collection is by far their greatest four films.  I do own other Turner Classic releases and the restoration is outstanding for both the audio and visual, so I'm sure the same can be said of this set.

Other reviewers offered great descriptions of the individual movies, so I won't bother myself.  One thing I want to mention concerns the actual filming of the dance scenes.  Notice how the camera angle only changes once, sometimes not at all, during their dance routines.  This means that they had to do it right from start to finish - no mixing and matching from the various takes.  Fred and Ginger had to do sometimes 50 or more takes before they got one that they wanted.

The highlight of Shall We Dance is the Gershwin brothers' song ""Let's Call the Whole Thing Off"" followed by the incredible dance on roller skates.  This is where we get the saying 'you say tomato (to-MAY-to) and I say to tomato (to-MAH-to)'.  It all came about because one of the Gershwins noticed that Fred would pronounce either with a long I, and Ginger would pronounce it with a long E.  This, of course, is part of the lyrics.

Unless you are a huge Fred and Ginger fan and want all 10 of their movies, this is THE collection to get. If I had a choice of which four I wanted, it would be these.  Plus the price is beyond amazing, or is it Amazoning??",1364601600,3,1673,4.415032679738562

My favorite of these is... all of them. Generally in a set like this there is usually one movie that just sits in the box not normally  as good as the rest of them.

4240054,5,B00406UJZG,"Turner Classic Movies - Astaire and Rogers

ITEM DESCRIPTION:
A four movie, four-disk collection of musical comedies staring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The disks are housed is a standard hard DVD case which slides into a cardboard sleeve. For the price - I paid $9.99 at Wal-Mart - a very nice package. I particularly like each movie on an individual disk. Nice to loan and if one gets messed up - see error below - you don't lose two or even all four films.

THE MOVIES:
The Gay Divorcee - 1934
Shall We Dance - 1937
Swing Time - 1936
Top Hat - 1935

EXTRAS:
Several short subjects pertaining to the 1930's or the films accompany each movie.

 ERROR:
The back of the hard box states Disk 1 with a side A & B and Disk 2 with a side A & B. In fact there are four disks. One of the disks - ""Shall We Dance"" - was defective. I returned the entire package and the replacement was perfect. Just to let you know.

WHAT ABOUT THE MOVIES!
Fantastic - must sees! Show them to your children and grandchildren!
I have no knowledge of the technology employed but these 70 plus year old black and white movies are a visual treat. Images are sharp and clear and the audio is noise free.

4240084,5,B00406UJZG,Fred and Ginger dancing the Waltz in Swingtime and Fred dancing in the engine room of The Queen Anne en route to New York have got to be the climax of American dancing. These dance sequences epitomize the American spirit and the American achievement.,1353801600,6,250,4.704545454545454
4240085,5,B00406UJZG,"I recently saw the play Top Hat in London, and the dancing and music were fantastic.  I wanted to compare it to the
original movie, and there were very few differences.  This is great entertainment!  The DVD is in black and white, but it
is still an elegant production.",1350950400,5,269,4.448979591836735

4240087,5,B00406UJZG,"Funny, well written, well played, and who wouldn't like Ginger Rogers and Fred
Astaire?  They are not just a great dance team, but they play good together.  The
support cast in each of the movies could not have been better.  Tho story lines
and themes are closely related, each is so much fun to watch.  In my case, that
means several times, over and over.  Fred Astaire is probably the best dance and
song man, in that order, to come out in movies.  Lots of better singers, but
the dancing part can't be beat.  Ginger Rogers can out sing OL' Fred, but all of
her dancing is done backwards.  With the two of them together, it's great home
entertainment tonight.  You may have to explain to the kids, what happened to all
the color.  Enjoy......",1348444800,7,744,4.444444444444445

4240089,5,B00406UJZG,"Fred Astaire dancing is the epitome of style and grace.  Dancing with Ginger Rogers completes the picture.  I have been an Astaire fan for years and could (and have) watch him for hours.  His films are always bright and fun.  In a bad mood, pop one of his movies in the player and transform yourself to a thoroughly enjoyable time.  Sometimes the plots are corny, but so what. And don't you just wish you could dance like that?",1343520000,3,427,4.423076923076923

4240094,5,B00406UJZG,"I got this as a Christmas gift.  One of the two DVDs had broken loose from its mount in the box and was damaged enough that one of the four movies would lock up in the DVD player.  Amazon accepted the return and gave me a credit because it appeared that this item was out of stock.  I was able to see it on the web site so ordered a replacement.  The new copy had exactly the same packaging but contained 4 individual DVDs instead of two 2-sided DVDs as stated on the box, and a different way to mount the DVDs inside.  I prefer the new packaging since each DVD has artwork that makes it easy to see which movie is which.  I don't know how you can tell what packaging you'll get, but either way the movies are great.",1328745600,28,716,4.042553191489362

4240099,5,B00406UJZG,This is a small collection of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies with singing and dancing.  Fred and Ginger made dancing seem so easy when Fred takes Ginger in his arms and they become one in the dance.  The truth is known they have spent hours in preparing their dance routine.  It is said that Fred admired Ginger for her dedication in their work that Ginger would bleed through her shoes and never complained. I am so pleased with my collection of Fred and Ginger.,1316822400,3,470,4.5058823529411764

The old school days of movie making is so much more pleasant and charming than movies these days in our society.  These two (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) are two naturally talented and intriguing actor & actress to watch.  They naturally flow with music without forcing any dance movement and the songs are just lovely.  There is no one on the movie screens today who could ever replicate that kind of talent and finesse.

Pure escapism and what can be better than that? The Astaire/Rogers musicals put a smile on my face. The Gay Divorcee includes the classic the Oscar winning The Continental. Shall We Dance is the lesser of the four but still stands as top entertainment. For an evening of sheer entertainment, just watch any of them.
