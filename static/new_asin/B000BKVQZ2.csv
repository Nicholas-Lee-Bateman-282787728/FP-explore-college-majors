8135957,4,B000BKVQZ2,"""I think Don Luis had the combination on his head"" -says Refifi (German Valdes) when they accidentally drop the safe on Don Luis (Andres Soler) head and the safe opens by itself...
-Here is when you laugh-
They had planned to steal some negatives so they could expose the real jewel thieves but everything was going wrong due to the ''mexican punctuality'' of everybody, like, the maid was not going home at the same time she always used to, the watchman was not doing the round at the same time he always used to, the police car was not watching like they always used to, and so on...
Then in a scene where silence was absolutely necessary and they start communicating with each other via inter titles, like in a silent movie, and they are bilingual!
Some ad lib dialog goes like this -They must have been stolen by Hector Chavez and Christian Martell, I mean, Andre Cointreau""- possibly with reference to something that happened back then. Hctor is unknown to me, but Christiane Martell was Miss Universe in 1953.
Refifi entre las mujeres (1958) with Don German Valds, Sonia Furi, Andrs Soler, Consuelo Guerrero de Luna among many others, is a very good comedy...",1316736000,,1165,4.68780487804878
