Nothing to loose. The score for this movie is 50%. Screenplay was good. Acting was good. Good Direction. The songs in this movie are average. Usual Hindi masala. Friendship, love, vengeance, hatred, fight, killings, ending. Story goes very interesting for the usual Hindi movie lovers. Jackie, Sunny, Anupam have all done a good acting.",1302393600,,508,4.532608695652174
