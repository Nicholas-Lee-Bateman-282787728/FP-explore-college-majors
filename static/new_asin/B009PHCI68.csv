5360419,5,B009PHCI68,"First I would like to say that this collection is 5 blu discs, not 1 as Amazon has listed. This set contains all 5 of the Wrong Turn movies on individual discs with the special features as they were originally released. This is not like the recently released Saw set that came bare bones with no extras.

So why should you get this set? There really is no reason if you already own the individual blu ray releases of the Wrong Turn movies, but if you do not this is a great bargain. Yes, it's true that these are not the best horror movies ever made, but they are a lot of fun to watch. Also it's great if you want to catch up on the series before Wrong Turn 6 is released in a couple weeks.

I would highly suggest this set to anyone new to the series or would like to watch some slasher flicks. With Halloween only a few weeks away this set makes a great marathon for any fright night.",1413158400,35,887,4.091954022988506

5360431,5,B009PHCI68,"I recently purchased this set from Amazon (even though I've watched these movies a dozen times) and I'm happy with this purchase.

Wrong Turn is your classic horror movie clich, a group of college kids get lost, a bunch of killers start to murder the kids and then we are left with a Final Girl. What makes Wrong Turn stand out is even though each sequel follows the same formula as the previous entry, there's a certain charm to it that just makes you want to watch it again and again. Could it be the gore? Maybe the kill styles? Or maybe that they add cannibalism to these killers as well as them being from the backwoods. Either way this series is always fun to watch. Here's my review on each film:

Wrong Turn: This is where the series begun. It had some pretty well known stars that were up and coming at that time which included Eliza Dushku, Jeremy Sisto, Emmanuelle Chriqui and Kevin Zegers. This one was about a group of friends who decide to go camping for the weekend but on their way to the camp site, something blows out their tire and leaves them stranded in the backwoods. When they try to seek help, they soon realize they are not alone in the woods and they are fighting for their survival against some backwoods cannibal killers. This one was an instant classic for me, Eliza really stole the show in this movie. The movie really sets the tone for the creepy and alone in the woods feeling. The acting is good, everyone casted gave their all. The cannibals really do creep you out, especially the one known as three fingers, who in this film is really creepy, but later in the series, he just seems to lose his creepy factor. The gore is there, but not as much as I would like to have seen. There also isn't any great kills in this movie, except the tree kill (which those who have saw this movie, knows which I'm referring too). For this film I give it a 4 out of 5.

Wrong Turn 2: Dead End: This is the first sequel to the first movie. It's about a group of people who signed up for a reality show about the survival of the fittest. What they didn't know is that they set their show up right on hells doorstep. The sequel offers new cannibal killers and more than 3. New characters and new kill. I'm going to say that I like the cannibal killers in this one too, the female cannibal's laugh is creep to a point. I like they brought back the older man from the first film (who had the gas station, which I assume it's him). There were only a few characters that stood out to me and the others felt meh to me. The kills in this movie are definitely a step up from the first film. The movie kicks off with the first kill that was pretty awesome for it's time. Although you can tell some of the special effects in some of the kills, they are pretty awesome (such as the arrow shot in the trees). I give this one 4 out of 5 as well.

Wrong Turn 3: This is probably my least favorite out of the series. Wrong Turn 3 is about a group of prisoners who are being transported from one facility to another, but when a crazy truck driver rams the prisoners bus causing it to crash, they find themselves up against three finger and his clan of cannibals. Following on the success of 1 & 2, part 3 feels like they were exhausted and out of ideas. The characters weren't that impressive, the kills were eh and the biggest thing was the lack of cannibal killers. There was only three finger and a young cannibal who is gone by 30 minutes into the film and we are only left with three fingers, who they made like this brute killer and his character was never made for that. There was a lack of kills and the kills you do see are done with some pretty bad cgi work. It continues the same formula as the first two with the environment but it doesn't really offer anything new. I give this film a 2 out of 5.

Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings: Probably one of my favorites in the series. Part 4 is about some college kids going up to a snow cabin to have a good time, but during a snow storm they get lost and make a wrong turn towards an abandoned building. They decide to head to the abandoned building to keep warm until the storm blows over, but they soon find out that the building isn't so abandoned after all. This one is my favorite because of the characters, they go back to the original 3 cannibal killers and the kills step up their game again. The actors for this film were great and can make you laugh and feel like you're having a good time with them. One actress stands out from the rest for me and that is the girl who plays Sara, Tenika Davis. Everytime I watch this one, there's something special about her performance in the film that I just love. I was glad to see the three original cannibal killers have come back and it was great to hear/see a little backstory to them. They even gave the cannibals a little more smarts then they previously had.  The kills are a little fresh in this film such as the wire splitting the one character and the ending of the film. There are some memorable ones. I give this film a 4 out of 5.

Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines: This was another that was least of my favorites. Something about this one just doesn't sit right for me. Part 5 is about a group of college kids heading to the annual local festival in town. They soon get into a fight with a older guy resulting in all of them being locked up. What no one knows, is the older guy is the lead of a bunch of cannibal killers who will stop at nothing to set him free. Some of the characters were good for their parts, others were just eh. I think the Sheriff and the older guy who is the leader of the cannibals, probably do the best acting in the film. I found myself laughing at the characters more in this film than any of the others. Again, it's great to see the original 3 cannibal killers back in action, but did they really need a leader? I mean, they made it through 4 other films without one, why now? The kills are pretty interesting in this one (even though I was against the very last kill, which I can't say why as it would ruin the film for those who haven't watched it). My favorites are probably the third kill (first of the group to go) and the last two of the group on the soccer field. I give this film a 3 out of 5.

BONUS REVIEW!:

Wrong Turn 6: Last Resort: I honestly have to go back and watch this one again. I can't say I gave it a fair chance, but I do remember this particular film had a lawsuit against it due to them using a picture of a real life missing person who was later found dead. They altered the film since they pulled it off the shelves but finding one that isn't the altered version, is going to be hard to find (I managed to secure my copy before they did the alteration). Part 6 is about a guy who receives an inheritance for an abandon resort which him and his friends go to check out. They meet two sketchy caretakers who inhabited the resort with a clan of cannibals. The characters again were sub-par, they added more cannibals and the kills were ok. I would give this one a 3 out of 5.

So if your looking for a fun, simple horror movie series, definitely look at getting Wrong Turn. It's no Friday the 13th or Halloween, but it still is a great series love or hate it.",1515369600,,7222,4.18547807332854

5360439,3,B009PHCI68,"Wrong Turn was one of the few horror gems of the 2000s, among a revival of the genre's worst aspects. The sequel was cheesier, but still a lot of fun. This collection is worth it for these two films alone. The last three films are total garbage. Worthless sequels that fail to understand even the most basic aspects of what made the first two films successful. But at this price you're essentially getting them for free anyway.

Personally, I'd rather just have the two good ones sitting on my shelf. I will never find any reason to watch the other films in this series again. But this is a cheap way to pad a horror library if you aren't picky.",1509408000,,645,4.375

5360454,3,B009PHCI68,"Wrong Turn is a little series of horror flicks released by WV that even tho some of the sequels have not faired as well as the first 2 or 3 films, they have still had a lot of faith in the series and continued to release 6 of the films so far. Unfortunately the 6th is yet to be included in a box set with the others, but honestly, having 1-5 on bluray is fine, as you will probably only enjoy the first 3 anyway.

Each film revolves around a family of inbred cannibals living in the wild or a small hillbilly like home deep in the woods somewhere in West Virginia. The series starts out being about 3 of the members of this family who set up traps along roads and capture unsuspecting motorists using roads near by that are not located on maps and the drivers hoping is a short cut... however, the title of the movie gives away where these roads lead.

Even tho I have said it's like watching Jason Voorhees cannibal cousins, each film doesn't exactly stay the exact same thing, even tho Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm St, Halloween and just about every other slasher flick have a known formula, but tried to mix things up so it wasn't always a clone of the last movie. Different locations arise and it seems part 4 to 6 try to keep the same characters going, however they do take quite a Puppet Master route, and with that said, Wrong Turn will take no awards for being an original series, and borrows heavily on what has been already been done for 40 years in horror movies, but it does have it's own style and tone that you even up noticing things they have borrowed from, and just take it as homage or tribute to the old slashers rather than just a rip-off. They seem to be made for fans of the 80's slasher genre and combine a little of this and that to leave you getting it, and not criticizing it.

I binge watched the 6 films in 3 days, having never watched any of them before... and I will say unlike some other slashers I've already mentioned, not many of these Wrong Turn films have much replay value once you've seen them, and I'm pretty sure most people might agree that the first 2 or 3 are the only ones worth a watch, but I won't say don't watch them, my suggestion is check out the first 2 at least, and if you feel you're interested in seeing the rest, go for it, they're OK for at least one nights viewing pleasure, but what I wouldn't suggest is purchasing this unless it's cheap, as you may end up with a few flicks you'll wanna get rid of from not watching again.

Also, their is a couple of cheap CGI gore scenes that are a bit like Final Destination kills in creativity and visual, just not with as high a budget as FD, but they are still pretty cool and not so bad you laugh at them, so for gore fans, you might get a little tickle out of a few scenes in each of the 6 films, but again, like I said, mostly it's a watch it once and you're done sort of thing.

The first 2 films I give a 5/10 to, or 3/5.
The 3rd and 4th are 4/10, 2.5/5
The 5th a 2/10 or 1.5/5
The 6th 3/10 or 2/5

Those scores may seem low, but I will say the films are not boring, you can easily get from start to finish, they are entertaining enough, kill scenes are decent to mediocre. Acting changes with every film, but again, each film is watchable once. I didn't walk away thinking I shouldnt have bothered, or felt it was a complete waste of time i'll never get back in my life... they just don't have the wow factor, or replay value that earns a film a higher rating.",1491177600,,3472,4.143916913946588
