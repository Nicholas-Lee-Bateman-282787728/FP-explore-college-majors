6131695,3,B00H4BVVSI,"Fun fair for all over 12 years old (because of the 'blood n gore') and should do quite well with the teenage demographic. The special effects with the 'robot-croc' were pretty good and went well with the story line. Over all a fine beastly fun film for a weekend night with popcorn,",1398038400,,282,4.4423076923076925
6131696,5,B00H4BVVSI,"i love horror movies like these do not like when people kill people i love monster movies only
like this one",1397433600,,108,4.190476190476191
6131697,2,B00H4BVVSI,"The military loses a bunch of nano-bots in a zoo where they immediately fly into a crocodile and turn it into a mechanical killer, with an appetite for jailbait in bikinis. Duffy (Corin Nemec- saved the planet also in Dracano) is the knowledgeable zoo keeper and croc wrestler. He is joined by a biologist (Lisa McAllister who played ""passenger"" in ""Dark Knight) who just hired on. In spite of that fact she has nice eyes and he is capable of developing deep feelings for her in about 45 minutes after they show each other their scars. The film is saved by the evil one, Dee Wallace. Dee as you recalled personally rescued 1 star films like ""Bonnie & Clyde: Justified,"" ""Hansel & Gretel"" ""Lords of Salem"" and ""Exit Humanity."" I look forward to seeing her star as Sharon Sommers in the much awaited release of ""Zombie Killers: Elephant's Graveyard.""

I think you get the picture. Not much to see here except the same old stuff. $9.96 Walmart. They rolled the credits real fast at the end, apparently no one wanted to be be known they were connected to the film. The small print on the back is a bit blurry too.

Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. A film you let the kids watch before you go to the zoo.",1396396800,,1210,4.470588235294118
6131698,5,B00H4BVVSI,"Sci Fi continues to put out these awful movies, its great fun if you don't take it seriously. Terrible dialogue, most of the cuts don't make sense, and most of the plot is just made up on the spot it seems. Awesome, awesome, awesome.",1394928000,,233,4.318181818181818
6131699,3,B00H4BVVSI,"I agree with one of the other reviews that this is more syfy schlock. But it did have several elements I like in my schlock. There is always a sociopathic authority figure that doesn't value human life with a counter-agenda. As these movies ""plot"" (if you can call it that) unrolls, I start hoping that by the end of the movie, the ""hate-ables"" will get what is coming to them. By about three quarters of the way through the film, I had decided who I was hoping would be eaten by the end. Sometimes it is ok to root for the monster. I do feel bad for Stella, who didn't ask to play this particular role. I am not sorry I watched it. I don't even mind that I paid several dollars.

This movie was a combination of ""mutant species"" and any of the syfy croc movies.

6131700,1,B00H4BVVSI,"Standard B grade acting, and an atrocious script (I actually think I could have written it better---and that is saying something!), but exactly what I expected...people going in the worst direction that they can, not staying in safe places, the crocodile carnage scene very poorly done FX guy on vacation that day?",1391990400,2,314,5.0576923076923075
8629782,3,B00H4BVVSI,"dee Wallace is credited as a supporting actor.  she holds together what would be an otherwise story of of dim witted teens wandering around with thi 'hy haven't I been had for lunch yet?' ""abomidable"" was another movie she starred in, and shows the depth of her acting ability. not a bad movie, best with buttered popcorn.",1502064000,,322,4.649122807017544

8629787,5,B00H4BVVSI,"if you like the gory, bloody kind of movie, then you should like this one.  the croc eats just about everything in his way.  its not one of your a rated flicks, but its a very intense movie",1426032000,,189,3.9473684210526314

8629789,4,B00H4BVVSI,"Like most rocket mishaps, this one's payload accidentally lands in a crocodile enclosure at a local zoo/fishing hole/water park, infesting a poor lonely croc named Stella.  She gets a snootful of nanobots and immediately goes heavy metal.  Military types invade the zoo and takeover.  There's dissension in the ranks between a menacing sexagenarian (Dee Wallace as Riley) and a Colonel Montgomery (Steven Hartley) who mistakenly thinks he's in charge.  Also along for the ride are Corin Nemec as Duffy, Stella's zoo buddy, and Lisa McAllister as Jane (who wanted `field experience' in a zoo).  The rapidly changing Stella terrorizes the park; killing a bazillion people no one seems overly concerned about losing.  Corin stomps around emoting for all he's worth while Dee Wallace, with face of stone, fiddles with a tablet, occasionally remembering to sneer appropriately at everyone.  This is schlock sci-fi by the numbers.  There are no surprises.  People are attacked, dragged off then left bloody and mangled hither and yon, all the messy bits having been done off screen.  More's the pity.  I do love carnage; it's what you expect from crazy-critters-on-the-loose flicks.  In that regard, this movie is sadly lacking.  There isn't even a satisfying retribution killing at the finale.  This movie simply runs out of time, and the person you most want to see chomped doesn't get their onscreen comeuppance.  I hate it when that doesn't happen.

Otherwise, it's pretty standard.  It's neither here nor there where quality is concerned.  The `cartoon' croc bounces along, poorly integrated with the background (the same could be said of Dee Wallace).  But.  For all of its many failings, I still liked this dopey attempt at making a `monster' movie.",1422921600,2,1750,5.182142857142857
8629790,4,B00H4BVVSI,I saw this move on the SF channel.  OK special effects and good sub plots. I did like it when the B &/#y scientist died.,1419724800,,120,3.8
8629791,3,B00H4BVVSI,"B movie, Steve Alten would love it!  totally out of the realm of reality.  Poor croc gets infested by little nannobites which eat away at his skin.. If someone ate my skin I would have an attitude too!  If you want to host a B rated movie night, this movie would be great.  Dont forget the burnt popcorn!",1407974400,,304,4.189655172413793
