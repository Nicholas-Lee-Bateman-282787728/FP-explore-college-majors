3597590,5,B001G7PSZI,Well first of all they definitely improved the picture immensely.... and they included all the special features of the first dts enhanced thx version as well.. along with the original and extended cut of the film. I am totally pleased with this blu-ray release and i'm pretty sure all the fans of this show will be too. So sit back and enjoy Scully and mulder on high def.,1228521600,,372,4.485294117647059
3597591,1,B001G7PSZI,I purchased this knowing full well I'd likely have to update the firmware on my player. It won't play. Even after applying the latest firmware update from December 4th it still won't play. You can't even get to the menu screen.,1228348800,,227,4.560975609756097
3597592,5,B001G7PSZI,"I don't see it mentioned anywhere, but the 2nd movie ""The X-Files: I Want To Believe"" comes with the Digital Copy disc and code, just like the stand alone version.  The stand-alone version of the 2nd movie on Blu-ray is promoted with the Digital Copy included, but the 2-pack description doesn't mention it.",1228348800,13,307,4.7924528301886795
3597593,4,B001G7PSZI,"I really don't want ""I Want To Believe"" in blu-ray but I do want ""Fight The Future"" but this is a good deal,to get both blu-ray movies for this low price. If they were seperate you're looking at least $45.00 for both on blu-ray.""I Want To Believe"" was worse of the worse stand alone,from the series-season 8 and 9 combined. If they had stuck to the alien or monster story,I think the movie would have done much better. Shame because it was good to see Mulder and Scully's character back on the big screen,it's just the story wasn't a good fit and it showed through the actors performance.",1228089600,,588,4.453703703703703

3597595,4,B001G7PSZI,Let's just hope they got the transfer done nice and clean this time as the THX anamorphic release done a few years ago had picture problems with Fight the future. No matter where I purchased it.(8 different copies) They all had the same problem. A line going across the screen just about the middle of the picture for the first half of the movie.(Seemed to be a layer problem as when the layer changed at the dead end road before the train scene it went away) FOX says we have never heard about or seen this problem but they would not watch the disc when I ask them to as well. THX won't even respond as well. The first release that was letterbox (4x3) format was clean no problem there but the anamorphic picture is much better when made correctly plus they added DTS to that as well. I have high hope's it will look great on Blu-Ray. We will see.,1225411200,7,848,4.273291925465839

3597597,5,B001G7PSZI,The X-files are classic movies. Now in blue ray version. It is a must to add into your disc collection if you like these movies. The price of this double feature is reasonable. I did not hesitate to add it into my collection. Just a few bucks per movie. Do not hesitate but buy it  before out of stock.  You won't be disappointed.,1426377600,,330,4.222222222222222

3597600,3,B001G7PSZI,"Fight the Future was really good and well thought out but the second movie was just horrible. There was a lot of gore and it looked like Scully had her hair dyed red/didn't seem like a natural red color. Oh, on the extras on the Fight the Future there's a deleted/alternate scene of Mulder and Scully kissing in the scene where the bee is shown in the hallway.

Also, ""I want to believe"" comes with a digital copy disk (not movie DVD) along with the Blu Ray. ""Fight the Future"" only has the Blu Ray disk.",1423872000,2,504,4.25

3597641,4,B001G7PSZI,"Both movies have extended and theatrical cuts. I want to Believe has a short scene after the credits. I actually hadn't seen the second movie before and was honestly a little disappointed by the script but whatever. It's been awhile since I've seen Fight the Future but I'm pretty sure the Blu-ray version looks better. Certainly it looks good for an older movie I mean it came out what fifteen years ago? All in all pretty happy with it, as it was cheaper I think for me to by both. Also the second movie comes with a digital copy disk to download the digital copy.

The first movie was a gem, the second.... well at least I reunited with my favorite heroes.  The Blu Ray version is superb and the sound is amazing.  Despite the uneven second film, I always marvel at the exploits of my favorite FBI agents. The high quality production of these DVDs only adds to the experience. I would recommend these films.... after all, it's still Mulder and Scully!",1384387200,,524,4.725274725274725

3597654,4,B001G7PSZI,"The first X-Files movie ""Fight the Future"" was a great big screen outing bridging the 5th and 6th seasons. ""I Want to Believe"" tried to rekindle the romance but the story was murky and not as good as most average episodes of the original series. If they do any more movies they first need to do an EPIC film where Mulder & Scully find their son, William and together they save us from  the Alien Invasion. Then if they did a 4th movie they should do a comedy since some of the most popular episodes where comedies. ""Humbug"", ""Jose Chung's From Outer Space"", ""War of the Coprophages"", ""The Post-Modern Prometheus"", Small Potatoes"".""Bad Blood"" etc. Star Trek did it with ""The Voyage Home"" because ""Trouble with Tribbles"" was so popular.",1356739200,,734,4.689922480620155

3597657,3,B001G7PSZI,"I am an x-files fan. I finished re-watching the whole 9 seasons on Netflix and decided to purchase the movies. I saw the first movie years ago and couldn't remember much of it and never got to see the second movie.

I think the first movie will be more enjoyable for non-fans as it has a much better plot than the second movie. Although it's part of the greater x files story, it's easy to follow for those that never saw x-files before. If you're not a fan, I'd say just buy the first movie and don't bother with the 2-pack.

I was disappointed in the second movie because it wasn't a real x file. They did have some unexplained phenomena and science fiction parts, mainly in the end, but that's about it. Not much science fiction, hardly any action and a very weak and boring plot. The only thing I did like about this movie is the focus on the relationship between Mulder and Scully. There were many scenes with emphasis on the characters and the relationship development between the two. As a fan I enjoyed seeing more of the personal life of the characters but it was a shame the plot was so weak.",1341878400,,1102,4.344660194174757
3597658,4,B001G7PSZI,"As an X-Files fan, I wanted to have this. On a simple packing, ""Fight the future"" doesnt't offer much than the DVD version (no new extra content and certainly nothing new on image quality compared with the DVDs) but ""I want to believe"" instead is very interesting, very good quality, a lot of extra material to enjoy. I really hope to FOX to decide the series conversion to Bluray soon!!",1332201600,,387,4.542857142857143
3597659,5,B001G7PSZI,"I really enjoyed X-Files weekly programs and wish they had never stopped

3597660,5,B001G7PSZI,"""The X-Files Movie 2-Pack"" contains both cinematic releases based on the X-Files TV series, the science fiction fan favorite which ran on network television from 1993 to 2002.

The two movies, perhaps appropriately, exemplify the twin themes of the TV series.  1998's ""Fight the Future"", released between the fifth and sixth tv seasons, is a big screen statement of the complicated conspiracy at the heart of the show.  FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully follow a trail of clues that leads from a prehistoric virus to the destruction of a federal office building in Oklahoma City to a global chase after the elusive members of a syndicate dedicated to concealing a staggering secret.  Along the way, Mulder and Scully work through a crisis in their complicated relationship, while Mulder receives what may have been the clearest explanation ever provided of the grand conspiracy involving aliens and humans.

2008's ""I Want To Believe"" was released several years after the end of the tv show.  Its plot is a classic ""monster of the week"" episode, in which an FBI agent is brutally kidnapped.  Mulder emerges from hiding and Scully from uneasy retirement to stop a hideous medical experiment.  The movie nicely updates the personal story of Mulder and Scully since the untidy ending of the tv series.

The X-Files movies have a mixed reputation among hardcore fans; it may be that the TV show just didn't translate all that well to the big screen.  However, ""The X-Files Movie 2-Pack"" is highly recommended to X-Files fans, and to newcomers wondering what they might have missed in a great science fiction series.",1282694400,7,1615,4.970260223048327
3597661,3,B001G7PSZI,fight the future is a great transfer to blu-ray but i want to believe is a bad movie in comparison. should just buy fight the future in blu-ray,1279929600,2,143,4.142857142857143
3597662,5,B001G7PSZI,"Both movies were excelent. I have then as DVD's, but really enjoyed them in Blu-Ray.",1274745600,,84,4.666666666666667
3597663,4,B001G7PSZI,"I've had the two X-Files films on DVD for sometime, so I know how they look in comparison with the Blu-ray releases. Fight the Future on Blu-ray certainly looks better than the anamorphic DVD, although you wouldn't know it throughout the beginning of the film until after the building explosion. The colors are way off sometimes. It gets better though and it winds up being worth the upgrade if you are a fan of the film. However, Fox did little work on the transfer to make it look it's best. All you have to do is take a look at the Gag Reel and see what the true potential of the film could have been. Some of the shots in the Gag Reel are so crystal clear, so phenomenal, that it makes Fox look really bad and really cheap for releasing this as is. The sound quality is encoded at a much higher bit rate than the DVD, so the sound is much more dynamic and immersive.

I Want to Believe on Blu-ray isn't a huge leap over the DVD, but it still benefits. The film still has a processed look due to the strong blue-green color palette used. I was hoping that would be lessened on Blu-ray, since the higher encode allows for a greater number of colors to show through, but it's the same. The blacks are better, the shades of light are better rendered, and there is more detail in the image. The sound quality is more dynamic than the DVD, though not by much, but that has more to do with the design than the transfer.

The special features on I Want to Believe are far more detailed than on Fight the Future, but I'm not big on special features anyway, except for well produced making of documentaries. What they included for the two films is good for me.",1250553600,,1654,4.281150159744409
3597664,4,B001G7PSZI,"As a huge fan and watcher of the entire series, this double pack was a must for me. I have not seen the 1st film on BD, but I have seen it on SD, and I liked it more than the second film. The quality of ""I Want to Believe"" is a 4/5. It was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma, and BD35K player.

While the 1st film integrates into the plot, the second does little if nothing, in my opinion to push the story forward. It was fantastic to see Mulder and Skully's chemistry again on screen, but the plot was convoluted, and I was disappointed that the entire story had nothing to to do with the larger conspiracy. I deliberately stayed away from movie theater reviews, as I knew it would be difficult for a second film to stand up to the X-Files fan legacy.

I just recently watched this second film, having promised 2 friends, we'd wait to see it with them. I loved some of the inside humor between the two characters, but the story was somewhat ludicrous. I still cling on to hope that there will be another film in December 2012 (according to Cancer Man, this was the year/month that the war between humans and aliens would take place, I believe). Although this is all a rumor, and more wishful thinking at this point, I hope that the series is given a proper closure with a third film.

3597666,3,B001G7PSZI,"I'm a massive X-files fan. I got rid of my well-worn VCR episodes only when they came out on DVD. So this 2-disc set was a true and well-received gift from my lovely wife.

The most relevant point here is the blu-ray presentation: Chris Carter indulges a thrill for the cinematic in his shots of Vancouver posing as the beltway in the depts of winter in ""I Want to Believe"". The scenery is gorgeous and leery, although with the dark ambiance of much of the action, the movie does not always take full advantage of the blu-ray capabilities (who needs 1080p in a nearly dark building?).

Now for the movie reviews: ""Fight the Future"" was a very necessary link that advanced well the story, and indispensible for a fan of the series who followed the mythos behind alien colonization, human conspirators, and an interstellar war. For someone who isn't a fan, it's a bit off kilter, but still a well-told and tightly written plot with lots of suspense.  That's movie 1 on disc 1.

Going to movie 2 on disc 2 is a bit of a shock, then. It's supposed to have been 6 years since the end of the TV series, but Mulder and Scully have aged a good decade since ""Fight the Future"", and so has Chris Carter's writing skills. The screenplay is honestly fairly lousy. Mulder and Scully share a good deal of chemistry (complete with Mulderisms) but the events in the movie are improbable even by X-files standards. Not that improbability makes a bad story (indeed, Carter's brilliant work in the series was getting his writers' improbable elements to make good stories), but there's no effort to explain the why's behind the little hill-country house of horrors that forms the impetus for the movie. Call it Russian science if you need an oxymoronic title, but really there are a lot of WTF moments here.

But if you're going to buy ""Fight the Future"" on blu-ray, might as well buy the second disc as well.",1236124800,17,1889,4.576923076923077

The second one deviated too far from the truth (so to speak); it was like ""Silence of the Lambs"" meets one of the ""Saw"" movies. No aleination, what so ever. They should've kept Scully's and Mulder's ""distant"" attraction for each other in tact, and not put them in bed together!",1233532800,4,434,4.64935064935065

3597674,4,B001G7PSZI,"A really nice boxed set of the two ""X-Files"" movie,  ""The X Files: Fight the Future"" looks terrific in its first Blu-ray transfer. ""Fight the Future"" looks nearly as good as the more recent ""I Want to Believe"".

""Fight the Future"" info:
Fox has upgraded this for Blu-ray with new extras including a new featurette and a new PIP commentary by Chris Carter, Frank Spotnitz, Daniel Sackheim and Director Rob Bowman. We also get the gag reel and everything that I can recall from the original DVD. The extras are high def as well. We get both the theatrical cut and unrated DVD version BOTH remastered for high def. There is no Digital Copy for the film included.

The plot (SPOILERS): Set between the fifth and sixth season of the TV series, the X files has been closed down. Mulder and Scully have been reassigned. They work a terrorist threat in Texas. When Mulder follows a hunch he discovers the bomb and it's in a DIFFERENT building than they've been canvasing. More importantly, a doctor (Martin Landau)informs Mulder that there were a little boy and a fireman that rescued the boy that was infected with a pathogen in the bombed building. They were already DEAD when the bomb went off and clearly the bombing was designed to cover this up.

""Fight the Future"" is a strong movie and a key ""episode"" of the mythology arc but can stand on its own as well. Rob Bowman opens up the show making it appropriate for the big screen with a often visually dazzling movie with top notch visual effects.

""I Want To Believe""
Includes featurettes on the film, a PIP commentary track with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz as well as a full blown documentary on the making of the film.

The Plot: (SPOILERS) Mulder comes out of hiding and Scully out of ""retirement"" to help find a kidnapped FBI agent. Because of their experience with the X-files, they are called int to verify if a disgraced pedophile priest (Billy Connolly in an excellent performance)is, indeed, psychic as he claims to know that the FBI agent is alive and he's having visions related to the case.

I had mixed feelings about the film--it's a good one which reminds me of some of the non-mythology episodes that would be squeezed in between those key episodes. It plays like a smaller, more intimate movie so don't come expecting ""Fight the Future"" and you won't be disappointed. The story is a bit muddled at times and is a bit slow paced but has its rewards.

The film, regardless of how you feel about it, looks excellent with a crisp image that isn't digitally overprocessed. The extras are excellent with a PIP commentary from Carter and Spotnitz, a full length documentary on the making of the film. We also get a gag reel. It doesn't say it on the box but you DO get a Digital Copy of the film here as well for ""I Want to Believe"".

Fox did an excellent job pulling the original extras and adding some nice new ones as part of the new package. Highly recommended although it MIGHT be more cost effective to buy this as the two Blu-ray set.",1229040000,40,3003,4.546296296296297
