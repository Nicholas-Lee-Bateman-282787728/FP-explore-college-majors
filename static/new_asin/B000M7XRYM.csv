2726194,5,B000M7XRYM,"Paul VerHoven has reflected on the Dutch resistance during World War II. In Soldier of Orange which was a powerful movie glamorizing the Dutch resistance with a protagonist who was more of an adventurer than a patriot, we are provided with a Jewish heroine who is a plucky survivor who does whatever is necessary to stay alive while helping the Resistance. VerHoven shows that the Resistance had in its midst persons who were closer to the German point of view on Jews than we had been led to believe in Soldier of Orange. There was good and bad in the resistance including rampant anti-semitism. Other than the heroine beautifully played by Caric van Houten, the most emphatic person is the German commander of the SS, who has an affair with Van Houten, and it is their plan to leave Holland at the end of the war together. At the end, you do not believe that many of the  Dutch were any better than the Germans. This is a movie that must be seen. After watching it, I watched Soldier of Orange (on my top list) and appreciated why this movie was made. VerHoven wanted to correct the image of the Dutch that he had created in Soldier of Orange. It is filled with action more than any other recent movie but has a powerful message to give to the viewer. Paul VerHoven had to return to Holland to make this thriller to cleanse his soul.",1177027200,17,1335,4.448979591836735
2726195,5,B000M7XRYM,"espionage, spies, collaborators, and traitors. beautiful carice van houten played a jewish young woman who sacrificed everything and suffered so much to find out who's the real traitor in the underground resistant organization did a great job in this very suspenseful wwll thriller. the ending is a very nice touch, because until then you'd never imagine or guess who's the real traitor.

sebastian koch, who played a naive play writer in the oscar winning 'the lives of others', played a good german officer in this movie also did a fairly good job.

very nice screenplay, casting, acting, directing and editing. this movie is highly recommended.",1176681600,6,647,5.152380952380953

2726201,5,B000M7XRYM,"This is an excellent movie. Israel 1956. Rachel, a Jew, rather unexpectedly meets an old friend at the kibbutz where she is working as a teacher. It brings back memories of her experiences in The Netherlands during the war, memories of betrayal. September 1944. Rachel is in trouble when her hiding place is bombed by allied troops. She gets in contact with a man from the resistance and joins a group of Jews who are to be smuggled across the Biesbosch by boat to the freed South Netherlands. Germans from a patrol boat murder them all however. Only Rachel is able to escape. She is rescued by a resistance group under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers. When Kuipers' son is captured after trying to smuggle weapons, he asks Rachel to seduce SS-hauptsturmfhrer Ludwig Mntze. Soon she will find out the attack in the Biesbosch wasn't a coincidence.
Won several foreign film awards. I don't ever watch movies where English is dubbed, but I couldn't stop watching. EXCELLENT, and great acting.",1504483200,,990,4.829411764705882

2726210,4,B000M7XRYM,"Great movie based on a variety of true incidents and characters from WWII. I love the actors performances and the leads all gave great chemistry. Some points in the film are not clear at the end, but it doesn't matter all that much. Warning about Paul Verhoeven (the director) commentary track. He is not accurate on several political points he states as fact, which should handily offend every possible side a viewer could be on politically. Something for everybody, believe me.",1498694400,,479,4.925925925925926

2726220,4,B000M7XRYM,"The most popular Dutch movie made, although I personally feel that ""Admiral"" was better, but that is just my personal opinion. This is an entertaining movie about the Dutch resistance in WW2. I feel however that the movie is a bit liberal regarding the secrecy that was necessary to keep people in hiding safe from the Nazis. Transporting them in plain sight on top of a barge was definitely out of the question, exposing them to small children would have been another great risk, as was being out during daylight hours and mentioning that they were in hiding to a total stranger. Shooting in broad daylight in the middle of Amsterdam by the resistance seems also very unlikely. It is a movie worth watching nonetheless.",1487376000,,720,4.768
2726221,5,B000M7XRYM,"World War 2 and very high level espionage, and death is the price of discovery. I would say this was an ""exciting film"" if it weren't so true-to-life, and based on actual fact. The film graphically shows the cruel excesses of the German 'final solution', and the story itself portrays all the twist and turns of the war. Acting is superb. The authenticity of the film is incontrovertible. The story will keep the audience riveted for the entire length of the film.",1485993600,,464,4.670731707317073

2726224,5,B000M7XRYM,"Wow.  Though the historical accuracy is iffy (the timeline is way off; the Gestapo were not SS), you will find a very riveting suspense film.  Sterling performances, particularly by Carice van Houten.  Its portrayal of the factions within the Dutch Resistance (some saw helping the Jews as important, others notably less) rings true and was characteristic of the partisans in virtually every country the Nazis occupied.  Overall, a gripping tale of survival in a period when so, so many had their tales cut short.",1483920000,4,513,5.071428571428571
2726225,5,B000M7XRYM,Done very well.,1483920000,,15,4.333333333333333
2726226,5,B000M7XRYM,"I typically don't enjoy foreign films because depending on subtitles gets annoying, but I'm slightly obsessed with anything involving WWII so I gave this movie a chance. I'm SO glad I did because it's a truly great film. The acting was superb, the storyline was accurate and heartwrenching, and most of all the absolute bravery demonstrated by so many during this time period was clearly shown, along with the suffering they endured. As someone else mentioned, it's worth watching this a few times to pick up new details.",1483660800,,521,4.931818181818182
2726227,5,B000M7XRYM,"2 hours and 25 minutes may sound very long time for a movie but all the twists and turns that this movie gets to offer, it becomes a snap. Carice van Houten is a superb actress. One great movie. Bravo.",1483488000,,201,4.05

2726229,5,B000M7XRYM,An excellent movie by Paul Verhoeven. Full of twists and turns and beautifully told. The characters are believable and the story set in the last few years of World War II in holland comes to life thanks to the brilliant acting and directing,1481846400,,240,4.604651162790698
2726230,5,B000M7XRYM,"I am very interested in war films and this one was a shock too me because I have never heard about it. It's a great mystery thriller that will have second guessing your own mind, just when you think you know whom the bad ones are, guess what. I highly recommend this film to those like myself that love movies with historical fiction. This might not have happened in real life just like this but you know that there are probably hundreds of scenarios which this film can relate to",1479772800,,480,4.344444444444444
2726231,5,B000M7XRYM,Solid Dutch film about the resistance in Holland during the Nazi occupation. My friend from Holland says this is the biggest movie to ever come from there. And it's a true story. Amazing sequence of events. In Dutch (because who needs dubbing)?,1479254400,,244,4.833333333333333

2726236,3,B000M7XRYM,"The Black Book (Zwartboek) is not really a bad movie, in that it has pretty strong production values and good work from the cast, especially Carice van Houten as the heroine. However, the film is predictable with little character development and a goodly amount of implausibilities and too convenient coincidences, to say nothing of the overly convoluted plot. The same WW2 resistance movie idea was done better in the Danish production Flammen & Citronen from about the same time. Thus, from me, a solid three stars if not quite four.",1476230400,,535,4.955555555555556

In the original movie in the end they drown the traitor guy hiding in the coffin by pushing him into the lake and you can see the coffin sink into the water while they traitor guy is screaming while drowning. In this version of the movie they have cut out that scene. This version of the movie has bee censored.

I bought this thinking I was buying a digital copy I would download and watch since I am in Afghanistan with slow internet streaming is not an option. As my 1st buy and my last from Amazon movies unless I buy a DVD or Blueray so I can do what I want with what I buy and not be controlled by Amazon so I can watch my movies offline if I want. This sucks also because I tried to find a place here in Amazon to ask someone about how to download this movie but could not even find a place to ask or email someone.

the only people who were anti Semitic.  Acting was suburb. Very realistically done. great effort in maintaining historical settings. A very well

2726258,1,B000M7XRYM,"Should be rated-X for the graphic sex scenes and graphic nudity, which were unnecessary and ruined the movie.

This film is in Dutch with English subtitles. There is no English language option.

The traitor is hard to figure-out, only because in real-life such a selfish person would not place themselves in harm's way constantly.

Other than that; the film is very intriguing; grabbing your attention with constant suspense, intrigue, and action. The action scenes are unusually realistic and so are the sex scenes. High production values, which take you there. Once the sex scenes begin; they keep reappearing all the way to the end.  This is a foreign film with a definition of nudity and sex, which is much more graphic than American standards. The nudity attacks your soul. It is not worth it.

2726262,2,B000M7XRYM,"First of all, all movies on Amazon should explicitly state the language of the film.  This movie is in German, which was not apparent until after purchasing it.  Secondly, even though the person who was a betrayer was not obvious, everything else was.  As soon as she got in the boat and declared that she would never again be apart from her family, you knew something bad was about to happen.  Thirdly, it does not make sense that the attorney who was helping the Jews escape would not have asked any of them to have write him to tell him that they were safe.  Not having heard from any of them would have been a clue that they were not getting through safely and that he was not dealing with trustworthy people.  (If he was worried about being looked at suspiciously for receiving postcards and letters from the neighboring country, he could have asked them to send their letter to him to someone in another country who would then mail it to him.  So that the confirmatory letters would not all be from the same place.)  Fourthly, she was a signer with a record, and it seems unlikely that none of the Nazis would have recognized her voice.  Lastly, the sex and violence were overwhelming and unnecessary.  I had to do a lot of fast forwarding through those parts.  The reason I gave this movie two stars was that I liked the happy ending.  Overall, it was not a great film.",1461628800,,1376,4.438247011952191

This is an older movie, by a director I had never heard of before, but it came highly recommended to me by a co-worker.  The subject matter is something that the younger generation needs to be aware of... namely, the oppression of the European theater during WWII under the Nazi terror.  One week later, a friend of mine asked how I enjoyed the new Star Wars movie, and I told him I found it entertaining, but the movie 'BLACK BOOK' made more of an impression on us, and I think it's a better movie.  If you buy this movie, you will want to watch it at least twice to get some of the subtle points that you probably missed on the first viewing.

2726304,5,B000M7XRYM,"This is a great WWII film about a young Jewish woman who becomes a spy for the Dutch resistance against the Nazis.

Carice van Houten plays the sexy heroine who does whatever it takes to infiltrate the Nazis that are occupying the Dutch in the late days of the war.  Corruption and intrigue are readily found both within the Nazi ranks and the local population.  As the story unfolds, it becomes increasingly hard to know who can be trusted on both sides of the conflict.

This is an extremely well executed film by director Paul Verhoeven, and van Houten gives a riveting performance as the lead actress surrounded by a strong supporting cast.  Excellent editing keeps the pace of the film fairly quick despite its two-and-a-half hours in length, and solid set decoration, location selection, and cinematography immerses one quite thoroughly in the period setting.  This is a superb drama that I cannot recommend enough.",1436659200,11,921,4.909677419354839

Many people of Jewish faith refuse to see this movie based on the premise of a love affair between a Jewess and a Nazi SS officer.  That is NOT the movie.

2726350,5,B000M7XRYM,"Filmmaker Paul Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands after more than twenty years of success in Hollywood. This time,he directed this epic- scale war drama based on a true story entitled,Black Book. It is a World War II film about a young Jewish woman in the Netherlands who becomes a spy for the resistance after tragedy befalls her in an encounter with the Nazis.

The plot revolves around Rachel Steinn. She is a beautiful Jewish woman living in German-occupied Holland during late 1944. Her family members - who have been falsely promised safe passage to Belgium are instead robbed and slaughtered by the Germans on a premeditated basis as Rachel herself manages to escape by diving into the water and swimming away. She narrowly avoids capture, then joins the local resistance movement. With her hair dyed blonde, she can easily pass for Aryan, and when the leader of the Dutch resistance movement learns his son has been captured by Axis forces, Rachel is asked to use her feminine charms to persuade a German commander to arrange for the boy's release. She soon finds herself caught up in a dangerous double life as she becomes a sexual plaything for the Nazis while attempting to bring down their evil empire as a spy.

Blackbook is one film that is hard-core with raw violence, intense action, graphic sexuality and a twisting plot that offers a series of surprises. Despite of that,it remains one entertaining melodrama. Verhoeven's film is out of character considering it is tasteful and artistic as based from his previous work. But nevertheless,he manages to pull through as he was able to provide intriguing characters that are morally complex and ambiguous like Stein,who are ordinary people were forced to do extraordinary and even awful for the sake of good of the world and change in the course of history. It also presents a tale of courage and determination in a espionage thriller. Aside from Verhoeven,credit also should be given to Carice van Houten for her excellent performance as Rachel Stein. She was able to provide an intriguing character that was a human being who has her own moral strengths and weaknesses that the viewer could empathize and relate to for she is far from being a heroine figure-types that are expected in these genres of films. It was stated that this Black Book was considered the greatest Dutch film ever made. There is no doubt in my mind that it not pure hype and it truly deserves this credit.",1417305600,,2447,4.865707434052758

True, it is sometimes violent, often sexual, and occasionally revolting (the scene where the heroine has a large pail of human excrement poured over her is an example). But so is life, particularly life in a country such as Nazi-occupied Holland during the Second World War. Nothing is euphemized in the movie. We see life very much as it was at the time.

2726398,5,B000M7XRYM,"Black Book takes the audience to occupied Holland in the Second World War. Evil abounds and many people play both sides of the fence, each for their own reasons. Director Paul Verhoeven directs a masterful piece here. He begins with a Jewish woman hiding in an attic. After the house is accidentally destroyed, she's on the run, only to find herself double-crossed in an escape attempt with her family, all of whom are massacred. Assuming a new name, she infiltrates German headquarters by becoming a girlfriend of sorts to the local military chief. In the mean time, she helps the resistance with various acts that put her in mortal danger. The trouble for our heroine, and everyone else, is that this is war. Life and death are everywhere. Ambitions become lethal on both sides as German officers undermine each other while resistance fighters make deals with the devil. There are enough twists and turns in this plot to sustain it all the way through its two hour plus length. Along the way, there are several ""convenient"" coincidences, but the acting and directing are stunningly good, erasing any pretense of Hollywood connivance. Thus, you're in for a serious film that studies human frailty as much as the horrors of war. Verhoeven knows how to make a brilliant movie, and this is one of his best. Supported by a brilliant cast, fine camera work, beautiful sets, and a labyrinthian plot, he delivers what we sorely need in cinema, a director that knows what he's doing.",1377993600,3,1476,4.83794466403162

2726408,4,B000M7XRYM,"A Dutch production from 2006, Black Book is a metaphor for a document that details the opposite of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00BEN0YP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>&nbsp;-- a book that verifies Jews double-crossed and murdered by Nazis and their Dutch collaborators. The multi-edged World War II film tells the story of a Dutch Jew (Carice von Houten) whose family is murdered by Nazis who becomes a spy for the Dutch resistance, playing the role of concubine for an important Nazi officer in the Dutch occupation near the end of the war. Her success is muted by changes she endures over the course of her action and the fact that even the resistance is filled with double agent collaboarators in bed with the Nazis at the expense of Dutch Jews.

What a lot of critics disliked about this film is twofold. First, the Nazi officer (Ludwig Mntze played by Sebastian Koch) is too nice and the female star falls in love with him which seems not only hypocritical but incongruous. Also, the production if typical of director Paul Verhoeven's movies. Like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Robocop/dp/B000RLKCMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Robocop</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/B000OVLBHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Basic-Instinct/dp/B0000JCFPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Basic Instinct</a>, Verhoeven (who also co-wrote the script) leaves subtlety on the cutting room floor and leaves little to the imagination when it comes to sexual content, gore and action. If either of these put you off, or if you seek a film with greater layering and more subtlety in characterization, Black Book is definitely not for you.

But if you want 130 actioner minutes of continuous entertainment that never relents in its high energy formula, this is a film that will keep you riveted to the screen. I found Black Book to be equally an entertaining as any other Paul Verhoeven movie I have watched. It maintains the same high energy, dense action, limited characterization formula as his mainstream movies but with a lot of sexual content more akin to European than American war productions. One thing Black Book is not is family fare: there is too much sex, blood and guts for the kids. As adult entertainment it is outstanding.",1370563200,,2510,6.230547550432276

Black Book is a very good thriller set in September 1944 with not a single minute that was poor in this film.

This tale of a young Jewish woman who through various circumstances joins the Underground in occupied Holland and winds up as the girlfriend of the local Gestapo chief is wildly suspenseful with numerous twists and turns.  But one of the main areas of enjoyment is the radiant lead actress, Carice van Houten.  She is so beautiful and such a wonderful actress that you cannot take your eyes off of her.  You can really understand how the Nazi Gestapo chief would become so smitten and give up everything for her.  The film is spoken in Dutch with English subtitles although there are some segments in English.  The cast is mainly Dutch and German actors.  The only actor I recognized was Derek de Lint, as the Underground chief, who during the 1990s starred in the Showtime horror series ""Poltergeist-the Legacy.""
As stated the plot takes many twists and turns and there is a lot of action and machine-gunning of both Nazis and Dutch Underground fighters before the film comes to its very satisfying conclusion.
I enjoyed this film greatly, it is one of my favorite Verhoeven films.  And as stated previously, Carice van Houten is an absolute pleasure to watch.  If you want an interesting and engrossing WW II suspense drama, this is it.
The only real special feature is a documentary, in Dutch with subtitles, on the making of this terrific film.  Picture and sound on the blu-ray are fine.",1329782400,,1650,4.843416370106762

2726433,5,B000M7XRYM,"Just when you think filmmakers cannot milk anymore out of the WWII genre along comes Paul Verhoeven. Those who only know his English language popcorn movies (Basic Instinct, Total Recall, Showgirls) will be in for a surprise.

This is one of the most intelligent and clever scripts ever filmed. Literally there are numerous times when the surprises in the film you truly never see coming. That's what makes this flick a total thrill ride as well as an amazing work in capturing the ""look"" of the latter days of WWII in German-occupied, and later liberated, Holland.

In the end this film does not work at all without Carice Van Houten who as the fulcrum around which all the mystery and thrills revolves pulls off this role of a lifetime.

Of course, no Verhoeven flick can be shot without the requisite babes showing their assets so fans of that aspect of the randy old Dutchman will also not be disappointed but unlike Showgirls, the choices seem to actually work within the context of the script.

The extras are just a director's commentary track and a making of where we get to know some good bits about the Dutch and German actors esp. the real-life friendship between the two main female actors and also this tidbit--the entire film cost just 16 million euros.",1324425600,,1267,4.719457013574661
2726434,5,B000M7XRYM,"A Rolling Stone quote on the case is ""Provocative and Potently Erotic"".  This is a very good description of this film.  It is not your standard World War II movie.  This film presents a very different and very real look at the war.  The characters are well developed and we come to care about them.
A very good-looking woman becomes involved with the Germans to spy for the Resistance.  This is a game of cat and mouse set in occupied Holland where good, evil, truth or lies all become dependent on what one is trying to do at the current time.  While the story seems simple, there are a number of layers to it, involving greed, opportunity, fear and love.
The film is over two hours and is in Dutch.  You need to be ready to read the subtitles and watch the action.  Given the story, there is a good deal of nudity and sexual activity.  The film never becomes NC-17 or X rated but this is for adults.
This is one of the best foreign films about World War II.  This and Soldier of Orange are the two WWII Dutch I wanted in my library.  Paul Verhoeven did both films producing thought provoking and entertaining stories.",1316044800,5,1119,4.357487922705314
2726435,5,B000M7XRYM,"I am in the throes of the magical kind of trance that occurs when I've just been totally immersed for a couple of hours in a marvelous film. This is the real joy of going to the movies.

In this case, it is the 2006 Dutch film Black Book directed by Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct). Two hours twenty minutes of excitement, suspense, and wonderful acting. Dutch actress Carice Van Houten gives a remarkable performance, ably backed up by Sebastian Koch, Derek de Lint, and Thom Hoffman. It is truly a pleasure to watch these fascinating, unfamiliar faces as they put most of our American actors to shame.

Black Book begins in 1944 Netherlands as the Germans hunt down Jews trying to escape to liberated territory before being shipped off to the death camps. Rachel, the protagonist, survives a devilish trap in which her family is murdered and hooks up with the Dutch underground. In her attempt at revenge, we meet Nazis who become human and allies who betray. The mystery of Black Book is about who betrayed whom and when? I won't spoil the story for you but I will say the intelligent, complex script by Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven kept me guessing up until the very end.

The realistic portrayal of World War II Holland reminded me of an earlier Verhoeven film, Soldier of Orange. He has obviously grown as a director who knows how to tell a good story. He is known for violence and sexual content, but after all Black Book is a war film, not Breakfast At Tiffany's. I'm only sorry I didn't see this exciting film when it was first released, but better late than never. Treat yourself to a copy.",1315958400,6,1601,4.590909090909091

2726437,5,B000M7XRYM,"This is an amazingly fast paced war film set during Nazi-occupied Netherlands.
There are many twists and turns, horrors and bloodshed, Dutch pain and perverted Nazi pleasure, greed and betrayals, mocking laughter and weeping,  defeat and disaster, and death and destruction.  There are murders and lives saved, drunkeness and soberness, betrayals and trust, cruelty and compassion, war and peace, things hidden and things revealed, and defeat and liberation.  It's the tale of a Jewish lady, the Dutch Resistance, the Dutch people, their Jewish neighbors, the German Nazis, the Allies, and of war-torn Holland.

There's a watercraft which is supposed to save lives, but it ends up in the killing of lives.
There's a coffin which saves a life, and a coffin which ends a life.
There's a man whose profession is to preserve lives, but he takes lives.
There's a Jewish lady whose singing career is ended by the Nazis, but she ends up singing for and to the Nazis.
There's a Nazi who preserves a life, and a Dutchman who betrays a life.
There's a redhead who sleeps with the Nazis, and then she joins the Liberation. .
There's a defeat for the Dutch Resistance and a triumph for the Allies.

There's the war in Holland and the sounds of war in Israel.

I recall three nude scenes, along with related scenes and quite a lot of war violence and torture.

So this film is not for the faint of heart or for the whole family to watch.  The film is well done and acted, providing a glimpse into the shady and gray struggles between men and their fellow men.  More importantly, there is a clear distinction between the darkness and the light, between what is immoral and what is moral, and between what is evil and what is good.  If you can get past the violence and killings, and other scenes, it actually is quite fascinating to watch.",1314230400,,1825,4.675

2726439,5,B000M7XRYM,"I'd seen the previews for this one months before it was released on DVD. Sadly, I don't remember ever seeing a release in the major theatres & this would have been great to see on the big screen. Hands down, this is quite possibly the best film Paul Verhoeven has ever made. Make no mistake, Verhoeven really gets serious this time around & finally makes a film which is deserving of every award that could be bestowed on a motion picture.

For some strange reason, I've always gravitated to films about the Holocaust & this one is no exception. Whether they were mere foreign films or blockbusters like the Speilberg vehicle Schindler's List, I've seen nearly all of them from A-Z. Black Book reminds me more of Europa Europa or Polanski's The Pianist rather than Schindler's List however.

I really enjoyed this film for many reasons & it's almost impossible to submit all of them here. The first thing that comes to mind is the actress. Where is on earth did Verhoeven find Carice Van Houten? She is absolutely the most beautiful, charming woman I've seen in ages as far as motion pictures go. She's overly talented, undoubtedly sexy, & her smile just makes me glow. Hmmm, no wonder I watched this one twice during the first week of purchase.

Verhoeven really understands the actors/actresses he works with. I think he has really grown as a director over the years & he knows how to oversee a grand epic such as Black Book.

There is enough drama & suspense here to fill about ten of Hollywood's best films & you can never be sure from moment to the next what to expect. That's another great reason to keep your eyes peeled here. As a viewer, you are hooked from the opening scene to the heartwarming closure.

In the beginning, we see beautiful Van Houten running from the Germans in the initial stages of the Holocaust. Whether it means working as a servant in a Protestant family home or joining the resistance, she will do whatever it takes to stay alive & we are behind her every step of the way. Her biggest assignment is to infiltrate the gestapo & seduce the leader which she does with grace & refinement. What may even shock viewers is how she even falls for what could be perceived as a monstrous being.

Why this one didn't have a larger theatrical release or wasn't showered with Oscars is beyond me. Black Book was easily another favorite of mine which was sadly overlooked in 2006-20007. I highly recommend this one to fans of historical films & of course those interested in the Holocaust.",1309219200,2,2508,4.599552572706935

After that incident she dyes her hair blond and seduces a Nazi officer, a Captain. Before she realizes it she is in deep and the heads of the resistance want her to find out as much as she can, so she spies on the Nazis and what their plans are.

2726444,4,B000M7XRYM,"I saw Paul Verhoeven's Black Book in the theatre(not to be confused with Little Black Book, a horrendous romantic comedy.) Paul Verhoeven is a director whose American portfolio includes such films as Basic Instinct, Starship Troopers, Robocop, Total Recall, and the truly horrible Showgirls. None of these films are particularly good, and all seem to share a common theme of excessive violence, of excessive sex, or a combination of both.

I was astonished to learn that Verhoeven has directed two movies that are considered the greatest Dutch films of the twentieth century: Soldier of Orange, and Turkish Delight. While the plot synopsis of Turkish Delight does not appeal to me, Soldier of Orange, the story of students involved in the Dutch resistance, does. I hope to see that movie some day.

Black Book was of particular interest to me because it deals with the Dutch Resistance during World War II. Being of Dutch extraction, and being a student of history, I was excited about seeing this movie. My excitement was tempered by a certain anxiousness. What would Verhoeven do? Would there be any resemblance of actual historical events, or would it be an excuse for bloody shoot-outs and mindless sex?  In the end, I was neither satisfied nor disappointed. The movie begins with the words ""based on actual events"" which, in the film world, is code for ""we dressed everybody old-fashioned and then made up a story."" The movie does a fine job in recreating the war-time Netherlands (I think), but the fictional characters do not correspond to any Dutch reality. The film is poignant at times, while at other times it is so over the top it borders on ridiculous. There is a lot of violence, which is to be expected in a movie dealing with a clash between the resistance and the Nazis. There is also a lot of nudity, which is, for the most part, completely unnecessary.

Carrice Van Houten plays Rachel Stein, a Jewish woman in hiding. Circumstances force her out of hiding and into the resistance. Further events lead her to befriend the German SD officer, Ludwig Mntze whom she initially uses for information but later falls in love with. I had a difficult time with the idea that a Dutch Jew could have possibly fallen for any Nazi, no matter how sympathetic, during this dark period of history. I myself could not build up any positive feeling towards Mntze, a man who presumably would have served Nazism to the end if it had been successful.  Perhaps this is just due to my own bias, however. The film follows Rachel Stein's trials and tribulations right through to the liberation of the Netherlands.

Despite the problems I had with this movie, I still consider it to be very well-done. While it often seemed forced to me, it packs an emotional punch. The dark underbelly of the resistance is shown in all of its ugly glory. Van Houten's performance is superb, the story is intense, and many of the characters are intriguing. Verhoeven's often heavy hand succeeds in sculpting a work of true merit.",1301875200,,3006,4.804642166344294

2726450,5,B000M7XRYM,"If you believed Paul Verhoeven did only ""Basic Instinct"" (a success for Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas) and ""Total Recall"" (where Arnold Schwartzenegger offers a better performance), consider ""Black Book"", based on real events, as the director details in his own interesting commentary accompanying the DVD and Blu-ray.

Real life individuals are not just good or bad, as Dickens used to depicts his characters.  In this film we see that, by and large, the Dutch people protected Jews during the war, because, almost all along their history, they rightly believed (as Shylock, the complex character of Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice"" points out in his famous monologue) that Jews were in no way different (better or worst) than other people.  They were their equals.  While some of the Dutch people did fight against the Nazi occupiers, others collaborated with them, and there were also those who where indifferent.  Germans are also not shown in black and white.  Most of the Nazi commanding officers believed in Hitler's ideology that Germans was superior to others and, therefore, are destined to win, but not all of them where sadistic, eager to kill no matter what.  There are even characters who start doing good, then turn evil, and vice-versa, opportunists ... as it usually happens in real life.

Maybe, the story is not perfectly written for the screen, but, nonetheless it is quite realistic.  The film is ""courageous"" because it attempts to tell the truth.  Complicated as it is, but, nonetheless, the truth.
""Black Book"" is, perhaps Verhoeven's greatest film shot after his return from Hollywood.",1295395200,,1619,5.145038167938932

2726453,3,B000M7XRYM,"Black Book has gorgeous photography, brilliant costuming, fine performances and good writing.  Unfortunately, much of this is squandered on a preposterous story line.  How could anyone over ten take this story seriously?  Let's take just a few of the more outrageous examples.  The evil doctor heading the Dutch resistance group is constantly in the midst of fire fights rife with automatic weapons fire, yet we are supposed to think, what?  That the German soldiers somehow know he's on their side and miss him?  The Germans in Holland are relaxed and happy in April of 1945, even throwing a luxurious party to mark Hitler's birthday.  I guarantee the Germans were doing no such things in Holland in April of 1945.  They were scrambling to get anything they could in preparation to high-tailing it back to Germany first chance.  A Canadian officer allows the SS to execute one of their own officers AFTER the war is over with live ammunition issued to German soldiers.  Seriously??!!!  There are more examples, plus the myriad implausible twists and turns.

2726459,5,B000M7XRYM,"I purchased the Black Book at a discount counter in a local video store.  Oh! I was presently surprised when I viewed it.  The movie is filled with intrigue, double dealings, surprised friendships, characters who one would suspect to be evil actually turn out to be honorable and individuals who one expect to be good are less than honorable.  The language is in Dutch with English subtitles.

The Film Starts and ends on a Kibbutz near the Dead Sea in 1956.  A friend Ronnie(Halina Leijn) is a tourist visiting Israel with her Canadian husband who Ronnie met during the liberation.  It is amzing how allegiances change.  A few hours earlier Ronnie was servicing German members of the Gestapo.  Ronnie provided support for Rachel Stein alias Ellis de Vries, as a spy and a Jewish woman.  Seeing Ronnie triggers powerful memories from our heroine Rachel Stein.  The scene immediately shifts to the autum of 1944 in German occupied Holland.

Rachel Stein played by Carrie Van Hauten is being sheltered by a farm family in rural Holland.  The farm house is accidently bombed which sets off a series of events that involves a group, inside the Gestapo, that tricks wealthy Jews by offering them passage on a barge-like boat to liberated Belgium.  The passengers are murdered in cold blood and their money and personal possessions confiscated.  Rachel Stein's family is wiped out but Rachel miraculously escapes and soon links up with the Dutch underground.

She cleverly avoids being caught on a train ride by ducking into the passenger compartment of the Gestapo, Hauptfuhrer Ludwig Muntze subperbly played by Sebastian Koch.  They immediately hit it off over their mutual interest in stamp collecting.  The Dutch underground take advantage of this infactuation to have Rachel Stein (alias Ellis de Vries)infiltrate the Gesapo headquarters.

Ellis impresses the Germans with her singing (Rachel sang in Berlin before the Nazis came to power).  Rachel meets the individuals who were responsible for the murder of her parents and other wealthy Jews.  She fights her repulsions for these characters.  See the movie and find out who is honorable and dishonable.

As a final note, this reviewer was impressed with Carrie Van Hauten portrayl of Rachel Stein.  Rachel's role is a complex one.

Someone else wrote the scenes were a bit ""cartoonish.""  I guess it could be seen that way in some places, but I think when you're living in a time when you don't know from one minute to the next if you'll die (not many people were exempt from this situation you know) you tend to do things you normally wouldn't do.

I also don't think any of the sexual scenes were in any extremes either.  If you think any scenes were extreme, I suggest you go to a Holocaust museum or purchase dvd's showing the real films of German soldiers killing people young and old without batting an eye, and knowing that people were experimented on because they were Jewish, gay or gypsies.

In the after-credits, Verhoeven says Carice van Houten is a force of nature, and it's true.  The number of chameleon-changes she goes through in the film would be stunning all by itself.  But she also lends to each new incarnation a depth and resonance.  A wonderful actress.

The other actors are all fine, too.  Even the Germans come off as human, and not just sadistic fiends.

The writing is equally superb.  It combines elements of tragedy, suspense-thriller, wistful romantic ending--all flawlessly, all believably.

The filming is graphic and gritty, but never sensational.

I have also seen Paul Verhoeven films before, too, and never liked them much.  He seems to wallow in gore and sex-for-sex's sake: that is, he makes gore comical (which it isn't) and sex grotesque (which it isn't).

Although I am not too much on nudity in a movie-which I thought that part could be deleted because the story of this girl seem so real. It was difficult to remember it was a novel and not the real story of someone's life.

The nudity and violence is explicit followed closely by the language in spots; I would not watch this with kids, or my mother or daughters. But, that's just me. In fact, the nudity and violence is used very effectively and is integral to the telling of the story as opposed to being gratuitous.

The movie is very, very good if you like either European WW2 stories, or studies in human nature, relationships and the grays of real life. It is also an excellent mystery. This is not a movie where the good guys overwhelmingly win; it is a movie where the good guys marginally win. It is another aspect that makes it feel real.

2726476,4,B000M7XRYM,"This thriller takes place in Holland (the Hague) near the end of the Second World War where Rachel Stein/Ellis deVriess (Carice van Houten), a Jew, loses her hiding place through a freak accident of war. She borrows money from a prominent lawyer who admonishes her to trust no one. Reunited with her father, mother and brother, she manages to barely escape an ambush. She finds her way to the Resistance where she is asked to infiltrate Gestapo headquarters by establishing a liaison with a Nazi Captain Mntze (Sebastian Koch) who uncovers her true identity. She also realizes that someone has infiltrated the Resistance who now believe she is a double agent. Confronting one of the traitors, he hands over the black book. From here the plot commands the viewer's attention as you try to figure out hero from villain. What makes this such a thriller is that there are so many twists and turns it might take you most of the picture to separate one from the other.

The chemistry between van Houten and Koch sizzles, perhaps because of their real life romantic relationship. She maintains a real life friendship with Halina Reijn, the actress who plays an excellent part of a collaborating tramp. She and van Houten have stunning figures, and they are often on display.

This film does have its flaws. I gave a very vocal ""Pshaw!"" when a German general and prisoner-of-war demanded that a Canadian army colonel honor a German order of execution for treason. (BITTE)! Resistance workers are taken by surprise by German soldiers on foot and in an armored car. (The Resistance workers didn't post look-outs)? Fortunately, these Germans couldn't shoot an elephant in a telephone booth, and the Dutch reckon that they were Germans acting on their own. Uh-huh! Gut Gott! (Fellas, don't you suppose the German army will notice that one of their armored cars and a squad of soldiers is missing at morning roll call)? And, I can't help but wonder how her friend missed the public humiliation of head shaving for her fraternization, or how Ellis avoided coal soot on her red evening dress.

The script is in Dutch and the occasional German with English subtitles. There is a substantial amount of nudity and profanity, but it doesn't take away the awesome drama in this two plus hour-long story inspired by true events.

I was transfixed. Very few films kept me on the edge of my seat or even holding my breath. This one did. It was all the more ironical since I had never heard of this film or director before, and just picked it off the shelf, because I thought it might be a good story. It surpassed my expectations.

2726479,4,B000M7XRYM,"This is a very good film.  The solitary reason I held back from giving it five stars is due to the liberties taken with the occupation history in order to fit the story into a time frame of September 1944 to May 1945. BLACK BOOK cannot be categorized as a war film.  It is a drama thriller, complete with a mystery that is only resolved at the conclusion of the film, set during the final year of World War Two in Europe.

The film's main character is Rachel Stein, who later goes by the name of Ellis de Vries. The movie begins with Rachel in Israel eleven years after the European war. After meeting one of her wartime friends, the setting moves back to wartime Holland.  It is late 1944 and Rachel and her family have thus far succeeded in hiding from the Nazis.  As the Allied advance has stalled after September's Operation Market Garden, Rachel, her family, and dozens of others attempt to reach liberated Holland via a lumbering barge zigzagging through the marshes.  Unfortunately they are betrayed and intercepted by a German patrol boat.  As the sole survivor of the incident, Rachel makes her way to the Hague, changes her name and goes under cover for the resistance.  She is motivated in part by the fact that she recognizes an officer at SS headquarters as one of the Germans who took part in the massacre and looting of the refugees who attempted to escape through the marshes.

At the SS headquarters she becomes romantically involved with a Sicherheitdienst officer Ludwig Muntze.  Muntze realizes quickly that Rachel is not what she appears to be, but is smitten with her and does not take any action.  For his part Muntze also realizes the the war is ending badly for Germany and secretly negotiates a cease fire with the resistance.  Muntze attempts to assist Rachel by exposing SS officer Franken as an embezzler of looted jewels, money, and other valuables.  The attempt backfires and Muntze's superior, Kautner, imprisons Muntze.

The resistance attempts to free some of their own from the basement of the headquarters, but are ambushed by alerted German SS troops.  It becomes obvious that there is an additional traitor in the reistance.  Rachel, now imprisoned by the SS, is framed as the traitor. She and Muntze subsequently escape from the prison, wait out the end of the war, and attempt to clear their names before they are captured by the Dutch and the mystery as to the real traitor continues to unfold.

The above summary barely does justice to the film as there are additional twists and turns, but you will have to watch the movie to find out what happens.

Unlike director Paul Verhoeven's earlier work SOLDIER OF ORANGE, BLACK BOOK is not a true story -- though it is billed as based on true events.  This is where the film departs from some historical accuracy.  In the beginning of the film we find Rachel living in circumstances similar to that of Ann Frank -- living in a secret annex of a farm house. Later she joins other refugees attempting to cross the rivers and marshes of the Biesbosch.  In 1944 - 1945 the Biesbosch served as a regular route for couriers, refugees, and Airborne escapees.  The film then jumps from September to several months later, which would put the film in February 1945, though it does not look like February.  At that point in history the Dutch in occupied Holland suffered greatly in the what became known as the Hunger Winter.  With the exception of the soup kitchen where Rachel is employed, the Hunger Winter is not portrayed in this film.  Likewise in BLACK BOOK the Dutch rail service appears to be uninterrupted at this stage of the war.  The final deviation from history is that the Germans at the SS headquarters celebrate Hitler's birthday in a fashion that would have been more likely in 1942 and not at at time when the Soviets had already surrounded Berlin and V-2 rockets were no longer being fired from the Hague.

Those points aside, the movie returns to the historical period with the euphoria surrounding the liberation and use of German military personnel for labor and administrative duties in the months following the German surrender.

There are some very familiar faces in this movie.  In fact, four of the stars would also appear in 2008's VALKYRIE.  Actor Christian Berkel makes yet another appearance as shaved-headed German officer.  We have seen him in other war time setting movies such as DOWNFALL, VALKYRIE, and MIRACLE AT ST, ANNA.

In the end, BLACK BOOK has elements of war, Holocaust, love story, and  detective thriller.  Yes, as a European film there are some risque scenes included that lend very little to the story, but you expect this sort of thing from a movie lensed in the Netherlands.",1242777600,6,4701,4.7346437346437344

2726481,4,B000M7XRYM,"I have to say at the outset that I am generally a cinema snob who carefully checks out what the professional critics (Time Magazine, SF Chronicle, NY Times) have to say about a film before I view it. ""Black Book"" presented itself on my low-budget DISH TV movie package when I was channel-surfing. So, no chance to vet this one. Not much familiarity with Paul Verhoeven's work, either. And how lucky for me that was. I watched, totally without preconceptions, what I found to be an exciting, mostly believable, totally well-filmed and well-edited, and brilliantly cast and acted movie. ""Night and Fog"" it was not, of course, nor was it intended to be, And, yes, there was that crotch-dying shot (which struck me as a signature European detail as much as a Verhoevian one), and, yes, the plot advanced at action-movie speed and sometimes strained viewer credulity and even comprehension (a newspaper review characterized the plot as ""convoluted"" rather than ""complex,"" and I find some truth to that).

However, the reviewers who dismissed--often in tones of utmost sarcasm--""Black Book's""  obsession with action and nudity, and decried Verhoeven's decision to portray the Nazis in something other than the usual simplistic black and white terms, missed, I am persuaded, this director's fairly honest attempt to incorporate people, events, and situations from his own childhood observations and later research, into a compelling, multi-faceted, and moving story. In obsessing over a few scenes of nudity, the sometimes excessive pace of the film, and the shape-shifting of its characters, these reviewers have missed precisely what gives this movie its greatest value (besides, of course, the incredible acting of Carice van Houten). History books tell us that in World War II Europe, noble behavior was too often a victim of raw human need, and of simple human weakness under the incredible duress of war. War is not ennobling, and suffering by no means always builds character, whatever our elders may have told us.  Normal people can be--as in ordinary times--venal, or heroic, or both at once. After all, many people nobly helped Anne Frank and her family avoid Nazi discovery for two years, but at least one of those people basely reported them to the authorities.

This movie gets my vote, and apparently that of many Amazon reviewers. Anyone who still is unsure about seeing it might be further persuaded to do so by reading an interview by Salon.com with Paul Verhoeven himself, in which he discusses the genesis of ""Black Book"" at some length.",1241913600,,2549,5.076372315035799

2726483,3,B000M7XRYM,"To begin with, I did enjoy watching this movie, but there were quite a few issues.

The main issue is that you just don't care: you don't care when anyone gets killed, you don't care when Tim is tortured (by the way, he did NOT start bickering with Franken; and his shirt must have had at least one tiny speck of dust on it), you don't care when Rachel/Ellis is being humiliated, you don't care when her family and friends are gunned down.

The only character I cared about remotely was Theo, and I loved his scene when he shot Van Gein. Johnny de Mol was great in that.

The next issue is that I can pretty well guarantee that this movie would not have been made, say, 20 years after the war. The whole ""nice Nazi officer"" concept would have been ridiculed in the Netherlands, let alone a big romance between a Gestapo highup officer and a Jewess. It's a fantasy, and a badly done one --- Rachel/Ellis must have a stomach of steel: you could skin a live puppy in front of that woman and she wouldn't move. I don't know if this was intentional or just lousy acting, but it kind of detracted.

The next issue is that none of it really made any sense, and sometimes it just went too far: I mean there is NO WAY she got that painting back up on the wall before Mntze walked in. The movie was full of problems like that.

The torture was minimal --- the scene lasted less than 2 minutes. In certain scenes, there really wasn't enough blood (really, if you kill a guy via firing squad, there is going to be blood). It also was annoying that you already knew that Ellis/Rachel was going to survive it all, and that the whole movie was basically all a flashback --- any suspense that the movie might have had was defused completely.

I did enjoy watching the movie, but it was definitely below my expectations.",1240444800,,1803,4.319526627218935
2726484,4,B000M7XRYM,"Zwartboek (Paul Verhoeven, 2007)

The ultimate irony of Zwartboek is that co-writers Paul Verhoeven and Gerard Soeteman, collaborating for the first time since 1985's Flesh + Blood, set the framing story in 1956, at the outset of the Suez War. And thus it is that Rachel Rosenthal (Valkyrie's Carice van Houten), nee Rachel Stein, aka Ellis de Vries, finally escapes the aftermath of World War II, gets to Israel to live on a kibbutz (where, we find out in the opening scene, she becomes an elementary school teacher), and is almost immediately embroiled in another war. While it's not explicit, I have little doubt that Verhoeven and Soeteman, who have paid so much attention to detail throughout this complex, absorbing movie, had something to say about the plight of European Jews through their choice of setting during the framing story; if it ain't one war, it's another, and moments of peace are few and far between.

Rachel Stein, you see, was a spy for the Dutch resistance. Or her real-life analogue was, whoever it may have been (Verhoeven said in an interview that ""the events are real, the story is not""). When her family tries to flee, they run into a Nazi ambush and are gunned down, with only Rachel surviving. She is found by the Dutch resistance, and after a chance meeting on a train with Ludwig M&uuml;ntze (Sebastian Koch, recently of The Shell Seekers), she goes to work as a spy in M&uuml;ntze's office after he falls for her. She works as a secretary while spying for the resistance, feeding them information about M&uuml;ntze and his colleague G&uuml;nther Franken (Waldemar Kobus). But, of course, things can, and do, go wrong.

There's a particular scene in the movie that really explains why it works, to me. It's just after Rachel, using the alias Ellis de Vries, goes to work for the Nazis, at an after-hours party. Franken is playing the piano, laughing it up, having a good time. Rachel keeps looking at him, not quite able to figure out where she's seen him before, then she places him--he was one of the Nazis on the boat, the ones who'd killed her family. After her brief flashback, we cut back to Franken, still playing the piano, still moving in the same way. His body language hasn't changed, he's still jovial, but his facial expression is dark, ominous, just as it had been on the boat. It's the little things like that Verhoeven tweaked that turn this from an otherwise decent movie into a really good one. That, and the fact that romances set in the Nazi era don't usually work, but Van Houten and Koch steam up the screen; their chemistry is unmistakable, probably because they've been an item in real life for years. A very, very good movie, definitely worth your time. ****",1238371200,,2717,4.727848101265823

The story takes place in Holland nearing the end of World War II and the main character is a young Jewish woman, but Anne Frank this is not.  The film opens with a young woman teaching a class in an Israeli kibbutz as another woman who photographs her after exiting a tourist bus recognizes her.  Following a brief interlude, we move into flashback of over a decade earlier, 1944, and we are introduced to Rachel who lives in a farmhouse.  Immediately, we understand that Rachel is Jewish and she lives with a family that is protecting her from the Nazis.  Verhoeven creates in this film a realistic story that apparently is based on true events and since we saw Rachel in the 1956 opening scene, we know she survived WWII and emigrated from Holland to Israel.  This relieves any tension regarding her possible demise as we watch the next two hours of the film, spoiler unnecessary.

The photography was beautiful, the acting superb, the story interesting, and it was rewarding to know that digital effects were kept at an absolute minimum in producing the film, ""Black Book.""  Verhoeven's commentary was filled with interesting information regarding the filming as well as the history, past and more current, so I also recommend listening after viewing the film.  Details were exceptional and I was mesmerized by the makeup, although I did find it rather annoying to see van Houten always with beautiful makeup regardless of the fact that she endured some horrible experiences.  Her comfort in the naked scenes was exceptional and done very tastefully in each case.  I describe these as ""naked"" rather than ""nude"" because I really felt as though I was observing her and not watching from afar.  This film was part history, part war, part romance, part adventure, and a small part mystery.  All in all, watching this was a rewarding way to spend an afternoon.

2726491,4,B000M7XRYM,"This was a refreshingly unusual take on the War, at least from my American media-saturated perspective. Our media tends to focus on America's role in the conflict and largely ignores the dynamic struggles that took place between Nazi authorities and underground resistance movements throughout occupied Europe.

Black Book tells the story of Rachel Stein, a Jewish woman who joins the resistance in Holland at the end of the war, as Allied forces are on the brink of liberating the country. Stein is given the task of seducing the head of the local branch of the gestapo, who turns out to be a fairly decent guy, and complications ensue. Further complexity is injected as each member of the gestapo comes to grip with the fact that Germany has lost the war and regime change is fast approaching. Double- and triple-agentry abounds, with satisfying results.

The film also stands out in that it shows a diverse range of opinion within the ranks of the gestapo itself. The Nazis range from psychopathic to sympathetic, and some migrate from one extreme to the other over the course of the film. The members of the Dutch resistance are similarly flawed, which adds to the film's sense of authenticity.

On the downside, Black Book does appear to have been made on a limited budget, with substandard film stock and nothing remarkable in the way of cinematography or special effects. The acting is a bit heavy-handed at times, particularly on the part of the main antagonist.

That said, I would easily recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a fresh perspective on the War, particularly those who enjoy espionage and underground resistance plot devices. Viewers who are offended by nudity or subtitles should steer well clear.",1231718400,,1731,4.938144329896907

I think the German officer would have told the girl to disappear no matter how much he loved her. But that would spoil a beautiful film.

I speak to the director: Why on earth do you use the same stereotypes that eventually killed 6 million Jews to create your Christian characters? Yes, the director's commentary says there really was a girl made to recite scripture before she could eat oatmeal in hiding, but I will bet there was really a hook-nosed selfish Jewish banker in history. You would have to scour the world to find such an idiot Christian. We don't portray a Jewish banker because it is bigotry. Europe already rants about fundamentalists and Christians in blogs. I also found it utterly implausible that a Christian resistance fighter would sit by while the heroine was being beaten to death not shooting until the collaborator swore, even after the other resistance fighter was already incapacitated. Yes, you tell us in your commentary that a Christian resistance fighter did not shoot until a Nazi swore, but you added a women being beaten. A Christian guy would protect her. This once again shows bigotry and stereotyping. Europeans just about want to kill Christians right now if you read their blogs. Jews were blamed for capitulation in WWI, and now Christians are falsely blamed for Iraq. I loved this film for the story though.

I disagree in the commentary that we as Americans were terrorists in WWII and Vietnam.  We DID target military sites in WWII and Vietnam, it was not terror.  Auschwitz was terror. But we even were not allowed to target Shell oil refineries in Vietnam.  They broke every bone in our officers' bodies. And after we left South East Asia, 2,000,000 people were killed by Pol Pot and in reeducation camps. Simply a No-Fly Zone to inforce the North Vietnamese adherence to the peace treaty would have saved 2 million allies without a full war.

I did not agree with the comparison to Guantanamo in the commentary. These detainees were trying to kill us and prisoners are normally held until the end of the war. About a hundred released prisoners already returned to the battlefield to try and kill us again.",1228521600,2,2311,4.80352644836272

When her plan to escape goes terribly wrong,  she manages to take on a new identity, work for the Dutch Resistance, and infiltrate the enemy.  But working for the enemy takes its toll when both sides turn against her.  Directed by Paul Verhoeven, ""Black Book"" is an exciting, beautifully crafted World War II thriller.  The script is always way ahead of the viewer as it takes unexpected twists and turns along the way.  Van Houten is excellent, and the movie has the look of an expensive Hollywood epic, despite its far more modest budget.  The movie is fast paced, and contains plenty of action, but it's the story of Rachel that remains central.",1227657600,,779,4.703703703703703

2726499,5,B000M7XRYM,"Darn good movie about a Jewish fugitive who's Family and friends are massacred in an ambush, while attempting to escape the Nazis to neutral territory. She ends up helping the Dutch Resistance getting ""inside"" the local Gestapo to spy, sabotage and derail their actions against the Resistance in 1944. Excellent story line and script continuity that keeps you interested, with no slowdown between scenes.

The Jewish woman Rachel Stein becomes Ellis De Vries and temps fate at nearly every corner, all the while, falling in love with the German Captain Meuntze; who is trying to reach a truce with the Resistance (unbeknownst to his Superiors). Barely escaping with her life, ""The Resistance"" still after her at war's end; thinking she had double-crossed them, contributing (wrongly) to the deaths of dozens of Jews and Dutch Resistance. With the ""real collaborator"" uncovered in the Black Book she happens upon, from one of the many Nazi collaborators as he's killed soon after the Allied Liberation.

Excellent acting from Carice Van Houten as Rachel Stein/Ellis De Vries, Thom Hoffman as Dr. Hans Aakermanns; one of the Resistance leaders (and turning out to be a Nazi Collaborator), Sebastian Koch as the German Captain Ludwig Muentze and superb Direction by Paul Verhoeven.

Darn, I'm really beginning to love these European films. Another good Dutch film is ""May 6th"" - (2004) Based on events surrounding the 2002 assassination of Pim Fortuyn.",1221955200,2,1449,5.183760683760684

2726505,5,B000M7XRYM,"World War II movies never cease to capture our interest as they demonstrate the worst of man-kind and this movie is simply riveting. Black Book is about a woman forced to live the horror of seeing her entire family murdered and yet continue to struggle for life and survival in Nazi occupied Holland.

At the beginning of the film we see Rachel Stein, beautifully played by Carise Von Houten, our heroin, living with a gentile family on a farm. An allied force plane unloads its bombs to gain altitude and by mistake they destroy her refuge. This forces her to start a journey to The Hague, and she visits her family's attorney who disburses money and jewels that will help her survive for at least a year.

Unfortunately, a group of Jews she joins is part of a Nazi ambush, and she witnesses the death of her entire family as the Gestapo not only kills but then steals all the possessions of the victims. She does get the chance to see the face of the man in charge... something she shall never forget.

To cover her true identity she transforms into a blonde singer by the name of Ellis de Vries and infiltrates Gestapo headquarters as part of the resistance force.

The film has many cliffhangers and on a train ride, with the Gestapo requesting papers from all passengers, she shares the cabin with the head of the SS, Captain Mntze, superbly played by Sebastian Koch, and he soon falls for her lively beauty. Many spell binding situations unfold and we realize that there must be a traitor amongst the resistance because they are uncovered at every turn, but we never know the true identity of the traitor. The story is complex but a clear reminder of the danger of war. Don't miss this film; it is without a doubt... magnificent!",1215907200,3,1735,4.569131832797428

The pacing at the beginning of the movie seemed to move a little slow but it picked up as the movie went along.  Towards the end of the movie, I couldn't stop watching it as I was curious what was going to happen next.

One of the things I did like about this movie was how it portrayed some of the Dutch as collaborating with the Nazis.  It's pretty rare to see that in a movie.  IT is even rarer to see what happens to the those folks after the liberation.",1215043200,3,578,3.982608695652174

The acting was very good and the plot very complex. The scene everyone is upset about with the hair coloring did not bother me so much as a Jewish woman whould have to do what she did to pass as Arian.

It is just very brutal/sexual. So much shooting and blood and the final horrid thing where the hero is stripped and waste is poured over her was just too much for me to stand.

So I say it is a 5 star as far as qualaity and truth. But how it leaves you feeling is a 1 so I settled on 3.

If you cannot handle total violence then choose one of the many other great Holocaust movies to learn more. This will leave you very upset and traumatized.",1212796800,7,778,4.006451612903226
2726509,4,B000M7XRYM,"""Black Book"" attempts to assay a path between Spielberg's historical melodrama and Hitchcock's espionage thriller.  There are one or two jarring missteps along the way, which cause me to grade director Paul Verhoeven's effort with four stars. But, flawed though it may be, and even though it covers similar territory as many other films (""Lacombe, Lucien"" and ""The Night Porter"" are among many that spring to mind) ""Black Book"" remains fresh and hugely entertaining.

I credit vibrant performances, especially the lead performance by Carice Van Houten.  She is never less than credible in portraying the smart, sassy survivor Rachel Stein, AKA ""Ellis De Vries"".  This is a character and a performance that withstands all humiliations. (If you've seen the film, you will understand what I mean.)

Paul Verhoeven as a director always steers clear of the ""politically correct"".  But I don't believe that he goes over the top, here.  There is very little in the movie that is prurient, or even sexy, except perhaps a ribald song about a ""little pianola"".

Of more interest are the ways that Verhoeven continues to examine the psychology of Fascism, all the while turning many cliches on their heads.
Like Jerzy Kosinski in his novel ""The Painted Bird"", Verhoeven shows us that ignorant mobs can be more barbaric than Nazis, and that Fascism itself is a virus that few are immune from.  Verhoeven even satirizes the severe religious fervor of some Dutch Christians, as he portrays a Resistance fighter who refuses to kill a collaborator until the unfortunate man makes the mistake of taking the lord's name in vain.

""Black Book"" fulfills the first imperative of moviemaking, which is to entertain.  If some people find it ""too entertaining"" for the subject matter, that is their problem.

P.S.  If anyone is interested in reading an excellent book of fiction on similar themes (i.e. a woman who survives the war through collaboration), I recommend Jenna Blum's ""Those Who Save Us"" wholeheartedly.",1211587200,5,1992,5.092307692307692

As to most of Verhoeven heroes, the end justifies the means according to Ellis de Vries, BLACK BOOK'S heroine. Between the figure of evil personified by Gestapo officer Gnther Franken and Derek de Lint, head of the Resistance, there is a grey zone where people try to survive and be in the same time or in the same life, good and bad; the characters of Ronnie, the young Dutch woman who sleeps with German officers and of Ludwig Mntze, the chief of the Gestapo, are thus emblematic for the director. The ambiguity of this moral assertion won't surprise those of us who attended the Dutch and American artistic journey of Paul Verhoeven. Highly recommended.",1210377600,4,1464,7.371428571428571
2726511,2,B000M7XRYM,"My title probably says more than I can put into full sentences. This movie mixed the cheesy, swashbuckling, heroic, sanitized-warfare quality of Pearl Harbor (the bad-guys are all ugly, creepy, uncharismatic) with the sheer darkness of genocide and military occupation of Schindler's List (lots of blood, innocent people getting killed). Instead of blending heroic and tragic qualities, with moments of comic relief, like what usually happens in an epic story, the tone of the movie just periodically jumps back and forth between the two. A Schindler's List-Pearl Harbor mash-up would be another way to describe it. I'm throwing in Pulp Fiction because the good-guys aren't heroic in the traditional sense, their main virtues (especially the heroine's) are being coldly rational, calm and calculating. The good-guys (e.g. resistance fighters) also tend to be flawed in various ways (many of them curse Rachel/Ellis with anti-Semitic slurs when they think she's betrayed them).

And then there are a lot cases of women in weird, sexually compromised situations. This might be a good portrayal of what happens to women in wartime, except that our heroine just plugs along, as if all of these twistedly awkward scenes are there to entertain us, which they kind of are. Carice Van Houten does a brilliant job as the heroine, and I would love to see her in another, less nauseating movie someday.

I also detected political undertones that I frankly found disturbing. One of the rich Jewish women who's fleeing the Nazis at the beginning is reluctant to take off a (flashy) diamond necklace when the boat captain tells her it might glitter and alert Nazi soldiers (she says ""But I've worn this all my life."") Nevermind that this is a pretty believable thing for a person in her position to feel, in my opinion, it felt like the director was just rubbing my nose in a stereotype, like, just to be controversial and iconoclastic.

And then there are the opening and ending scenes of the movie, set in Israel, where the desert is enthusiastically blooming. The ending scene has invisible gunmen shooting at their kibbutz/settlement (founded with the money of Holocaust victims' families as a safe place for refugees, a sign reminds us). Of course we don't see that there are Arabs around there, just gunfire and the Israeli soldiers shooting back. Not seeing those faces is important, because up to this point, the movie was full of characters with complex, morally-ambiguous ways of trying to survive in wartime (excepting the really ugly, ebil characters, who are just ugly and ebil), and seeing Arab faces there would remind us that, like the SS officer that our heroine, Rachel/Ellis, falls in love with, and like other Nazis and Dutch collaborators, these too are people with their own stories, struggles, and complex motives. Instead, we switch to a totally subjective viewpoint of Jews forever dogged by senseless violence. (Because, unlike the Holocaust, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict doesn't have complex, morally ambiguous causes?) These scenes in Israel are only a few short minutes of a long, long movie, but they are important because they frame the whole story.

Two things that I give the movie some points for: 1) the Nazis repeatedly referring to the Dutch resistance as ""terrorists"", and 2) portraying them using waterboarding on captured resistance fighters. This probably isn't a very bold statement anywhere other than in the US, where the government tells us waterboarding isn't torture, and Alan Dershowitz argues that we should use torture, because it worked for the Nazis.

I'm very curious how the movie comes across to Dutch viewers.",1209859200,8,3655,5.125838926174497
2726512,4,B000M7XRYM,"This very different WWII film has more plot twists than a Harry Potter novel but nevertheless it is very entertaining to watch. Set in German occupied Holland, the intrigue and deception being played out by almost all of the primary characters makes it very difficult to sort out the good guys from the bad until the film ultimately does it for you at the end.
A plan to trick wealthy members of the Jewish community into a false escape plan in order to rob them of their valuables sets the plot in motion and the architects of this evil are not necessarily the usual suspects. The movie deals in people pretending to be what they are not and it is never dull.
For those looking for historical accuracy and plausabilty in a WWII film, this may be a disappointment which explains some of the negative reviews. If on the other hand you are looking for a twisiting plot with lot's of action this isn't a bad choice. Let's face it Casablanca isn't exactly historically accurate either but it's considered a classic. Black Book is far from a classic but it's pretty good.",1209859200,3,1066,4.557291666666667
2726513,3,B000M7XRYM,"If you like seeing beautiful young women completely naked, and posed in compromising and perverse scenarios, then ""Black Book"" is for you.

Carice van Houten as Rachel / Ellis, a Jew who falls in love with a Gestapo chief, is fully exposed onscreen, and things are done to her body that I've not only not seen in movies before, I didn't think I'd ever see.

The sex only lets up in order to make way for graphic violence: a graphic scene of torture by water boarding, death by firing squad, and suffocation in a coffin whose lid is slowly screwed shut.

Director Paul Verhoeven was criticized for depicting a Jewish woman as the lover of a Gestapo chief, and for depicting the Dutch Resistance as less than uniformly heroic in its resistance. I expected to be shocked by these features, but I was not. I just felt bludgeoned into numbness by all the nudity and bloodletting.

I watched this movie on DVD, and after a while I just fast forwarded or closed my eyes through scenes I simply didn't want to watch: a woman exposing Ellis' body to the very Nazi who had murdered her parents, Ellis being drenched in bodily waste, yet another pile of corpses.

The production values are very high. The movie looks fantastic. If you are into sex, violence, and sensation, this is the movie for you.

I've read a lot of memoirs of the Nazi era, and met survivors. The Nazi era was not fun and games. I find watching movies about those days to be hard. When I do watch them, I want to feel that I've learned something, or felt something, that made watching the movie worthwhile.

I didn't learn anything about the WW II era while watching this movie, although I did learn something about exploitation. I was unmoved. Carice van Houten is lovely, but she plays her role as a tough cookie. Given that she is a sex toy in the film, I found it hard to relate to her humanity.

In the end, when Ellis / Rachel finally breaks down and begins to cry, one of her co-stars morphs into an eyebrow arching, mustache twirling parody of a Hitchcock villain, and tries to murder her by injection. That scene was so desperate for shock value I lost all faith in the film at that point.

Sebastian Koch, who played Ludwig Muntze, the kind and sensitive Gestapo chief with whom Rachel falls in love, left me completely unmoved. This is especially remarkable given how terrific Koch was in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's film ""The Lives of Others.""",1209254400,12,2423,4.5389908256880735
2726514,5,B000M7XRYM,"The other reviewers have covered the plot and story line well, so I won't go into that. I'll just say that like in real life (it was based on a true story) things are not always like they seem. By the time you think you have the characters figured out, they will throw you for a loop. Who's good and who's bad? This one will keep you guessing and glued to the screen.

Carice van Houten is a beautiful, talented and very chrismatic actress. Carice and Sebastian Koch (who plays the Nazi officer who falls in love with her) have red hot chemistry on screen. It turns out that in real life they are in a paramour relationship. Koch's character is actually using his position as a Nazi officer to help the Dutch resistance, making him a sort of sympathetic character, as he finds his humanity.

Yes, there is LOTS of nudity, violence and graphic love scenes. It's a war picture. I tend to be conservative where nudity, violence and S.E.X. are concerned, but I do believe it adds to the plot and the passionate moods that the film maker is trying to create.  Not many movies have me thinking about them for months after I watch, but this movie did!

In closing, perhaps this film's very graphic portrayal of war isn't for everyone, but I thought it was great. The soundtrack was enjoyable too. By the way, Sebastian Koch was quite easy on my eyes. I'd love to see him and Carice van Houten star together again.",1209081600,4,1406,4.437984496124031

2726521,5,B000M7XRYM,"Now I am not going to call this a MASTERPIECE FILM by any stretch of the imagination, but as a commercial, mass-entertainment thriller it simply does everything right.  Namely:

1. Solid acting, directing, and dialogue: nothing to make you say, ""puh-leeeez!"" and choke or gag on your popcorn as often happens in your typical high-cheese, big-budget Hollywood thriller, especially in their last 10 minutes or so.

2. An engagingly original and unpredictable plot and characters: will not bore you to tears because everything that's going to happen in the film is systematically telegraphed/foreshadowed within the first 10 minutes, and the characters are not all a bunch of 2-dimensional cliches chosen by a Hollywood focus group.

3. Beautiful sets/locations and cinematography, and a very luscious Carice van Houten who is just as good an actress as she is a powerfully sexual and intoxicating woman, even though she has to dye her hair blonde during the movie.

I have to giggle at the usual parade of prudish American reviewers here on Amazon who are (gasp!) shocked and offended by (gasp!) the perhaps half dozen all-too-fleeting, piddling nude (gasp!) and sexual (gasp!) scenes.

Actually, compared to Verhoeven's infamous ""Basic Instinct"" (a decent thriller, though a bit over the top sometimes) this film is just barely PG-13.  The sexual scenes are not anywhere as prolonged or as graphic, and the nudity is tastefully done in a soft-light, airbrushed kind of way.  There is one rather cute scene where van Houten is shown dying her pubes blonde, but all you see is fur, nothing else...sheesh!  I would personally have preferred not to be subjected to full frontal and rear nudity of the one old, fat, pasty and hairy German officer (Franken), but that's just because I'd much rather look at the likes of Ms. Van Houten in her birthday suit, thanks very much!

Can't disagree with the many film critics who've hailed this as Paul Verhoeven's best works in many, many years.  Mind-boggling that this is the same guy who made the abysmally God-awful ""Showgirls"" (1995)!

2726525,3,B000M7XRYM,"""Black Book"" may be based on a true story, but it often plays more like a corny wartime melodrama than a serious film about war.  Suffice it to say, it has a lot of beautiful and glamorous people running around doing a lot of cloak-and-dagger espionage stuff - all while changing the course of history.  That's not to say it isn't an enjoyable and entertaining picture, just that it doesn't rank up there in artistry and truth with the great European films about the Fascist era - classics like ""Open City,"" ""Forbidden Games,"" ""The Cranes are Flying,"" ""The Shop on Main Street,"" ""Das Boot,"" etc.  When you boil it down to the bare essentials, the theme of ""Black Book"" seems to be that there's nothing like a little hair coloring and a bar of chocolate to help an attractive young girl survive the horrors of war.

Rachel Stein is a beautiful Jewish singer whose entire family is mowed down by the Nazis as they are fleeing occupied Holland (Rachel and her family are Germans currently hiding out in the Netherlands).  As the sole survivor of the attack, Rachel quickly becomes active in the Dutch resistance, her assignment being to cozy up to a high-ranking Gestapo officer who has taken a liking to her.  Soon she finds herself not only in bed with the Nazi but quite possibly in love with him as well.

Paul Verhoeven has directed the film much in the style of his big-scale Hollywood productions (""Robocop,"" ""Total Recall"") - that is to say with a great deal of energy but not a lot of emotion.  The convoluted storyline often becomes muddled and difficult to follow, but Verhoeven compensates for this weakness by keeping the proceedings moving at a breakneck pace (which is a good thing since the film takes an exhausting two hours and twenty-five minutes to tell its story).  Unfortunately, the movie has been fitted with a musical score that sounds as if it has been lifted from some third-rate espionage thriller from the 1960's.  Carice van Houten has brio and spunk as the movie's heroine, running around from one dire predicament and hairbreadth escape to another - she`s almost like a Dutch version of the perpetually imperiled Pauline - but most of the other actors simply get lost in the shuffle.  And if you've ever doubted that chocolate is, indeed, the answer to all of life's problems, you will never do so again after seeing this movie.

I must say that, even though I enjoyed it immensely, ""Black Book"" is probably the first serious film about Nazis that actually had me chuckling at wholly inappropriate places (some of the actors even hold their guns in a funny way).  ""Black Book"" may be a Dutch film by rights, but it`s strictly from Hollywood in its silliness and corn.",1201564800,7,2696,4.686440677966102
2726526,2,B000M7XRYM,"After having read great amount of high praised reviews and comments about Paul Verhoeven's historic WWII Drama /Spy- thriller, ""Black Book"" which he made in Netherlands, I was exited to see it. I am a fan of Verhoeven's early films set in his native country. I've seen ""Turkish Delight"" (1973) and ""The Fourth Man"" (1983) and I found them both excellent. Joe Ezsterhaus who worked with Verhoeven said about him: ""The guy is like his movies: brilliant, mercurial, very daring, perverse, a wonderful series of paradoxes and contradictions..."" Both, ""Turkish Delight"", Verhoeven's variation of Hollywood ""Love story"" and ""The Fourth Man"" which reminds ""Basic Instinct"" but with much more class, style, and humor, match Esterhaus' description perfectly. As for ""Black Book"", it was a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, Verhoeven's attempt to make a film which takes place during the dark times in the Holland's and European history is watchable and entertaining. Beautifully filmed and moving along quite fast, ""Black Book"" is the story of a Dutch Jewish girl who tries to survive the war and the Nazi occupation in Holland. After the failed attempt of her family and dozens others Jews to escape on the boat to the liberated south which left her the sole survivor, she was able to join the Dutch Resistance, to infiltrate the regional Gestapo headquarters and to become the mistress of the Gestapo high rank officer, Ludwig Mntze (Sebastian Koch of ""The Lives of Others""). Verhoeven's gets a fine performance out of his young star. Carice van Houten, as Rachel/Ellis carries the movie mostly by herself. She is beautiful, talented, brave, and convincing in every scene. I personally don't mind the scenes of graphic sexuality and violence - anyone who is familiar with at least few of Paul Verhoeven's films, should be prepared for raw sensuality, aggressive movie-making, and more than one revolting scene. The problem of the movie, IMO, is that it tries too hard to combine many different stories and many genres but makes too many obvious and deliberate historical errors for the entertainment purposes and ends up as the unrealistic, exploitive, over-wrought melodrama with the poorly developed key characters (above mentioned Muntze, for example) and too many unbelievable thus ridiculous plot twists. If you are interested in not just entertaining but more serious and subtle films exploring Holocausts, I'd recommend Agnieszka Holland's ""Europe, Europe"" (1990), Joseph Losey's ""Mr. Klein"" (1976), and certainly, Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"". If you want to see a film about disturbing relationship between a Nazi officer and a Jewish girl, two people who had met at the most horrifying circumstances but were not able to forget each other, see Liliana Cavani's controversial ""The Night Porter"" (1974) which is much classier than Verhoeven's movie.",1201219200,14,2854,5.260964912280702

2726532,4,B000M7XRYM,"Film is set in 1944 in Holland at the close end of the WWII.  Main protagonist is young Jewish woman Rachel fighting to survive.  As her hiding place in the countryside is accidentaly destroyed, she becomes unwilling participant of destiny set in her path.  Rachel becomes part of the Dutch resistance, she infiltrates local German SS team by gaining a job in their headquarters and becoming a mistress to one of the high ranking officers.  What neither German officer not Rachel expected is that they genuinely fall in love with each other.  Most of the time when we think of love, we think of passion, ideals, culture or interests that bind people together.  But these two lovers have other things in common:  they are both lonely in a harsh world of WWII and with no families of their own, both are disillusioned with the war and endless killing associated with it, they are stranges in their respective worlds but yet forced to be a part of it.  It is particularly interesting to watch Rachel as she experiences anti-semitism in all its forms: farmer reminds Rachel that Jews would not have problems that they do should have they accepted Jesus; her resistance comrades remind her that life of a Dutch person is worth more than a life of a Jew; and do we need to say anything about German's notion of Jews?  Rachel's spying career is short lived and she and her lover are subject to many double crossings on both sides.  Film develops as a thriller where we know that there is a mole within resistance, but cannot guess who it is until the very end.  I love the bittersweet end of the film where we see Rachel living in Israel, married, with children, experiencing spiritual peace while working with school age children in kibbutz; and experiencing war of a different kind for the rest of the time as Israel if fighting for its survival.  I loved complexity of the film, but also felt that certain parts of it (such as dying pubic hair) were unnecessary.  While director was probably going for the realism of the bleak situation the heroine was in, I found scenes to be juvenile, cude and voyeuristic.  That is why I gave this film only 4 instead of 5 stars. It is also imporant to mention that actor Sebastian Koch who plays German officer is fantastic in this role.  I hope we see more of this actor in internationally released movies because he has a great talent (check him out in the movie ""The Lives of Others"").",1200009600,2,2422,4.587006960556844
2726533,4,B000M7XRYM,"Well, this film certainly got my interest since this is the same director who made ""Basic Instinct"".  So, Paul Verhoeven has returned to his roots after his good streaks in Hollywood.  You probably have seen his Hollywood hits like ""Total Recall"", ""Basic Instinct"", ""Starship Troopers"", ""Robocop"", etc.  Don't get me wrong that I am a snob to pop culture since I am equally guilty for following it, too.  But, it did strike me odd that Verhoeven decided to go back to his roots with this Dutch war drama epic.  After watching the DVD special features, you realize that Verhoeven has a eye for detail.  The interviews with the cast are interesting, but the making of the film is particularly worth watching.  The entire cast is wonderful and the storyline never slows down.  Also, it's refreshing to see a new face of Carice van Houten who Paul Verhoeven decided to cast in this film.

2726535,4,B000M7XRYM,"The Netherland's `Black Book' has many attributes on its ""list"".  Glossy cinematography, excellent acting, and fine direction lead a movie with the look and feel of a classic.  The best thing about the film, though, is its distinctive story.  ""Inspired by true events,"" director Paul Verhoeven gives us a unique survivor tale during The Holocaust.

Like many survivors, singer Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), flees the Gestapo by ferry with her companions.  While many are brutally shot and killed, she manages to survive.  With little time to conceal herself, she changes her identity to avert death.  Thinly and vulnerably hidden, she has an affair with a top Gestapo agent (Sebastian Koch) in (then called) Holland while keeping her ties to an underground resistance movement.  Moving tip-toe with her comrades, she experiences a horrible juggling act that entails too much deception to keep her safe on either side.

While I thought that the story and execution were totally absorbing, and van Houten's performance is enough to give Marion Cotillard ('La Vie en Rose`) a run for her money as best foreign actress, some of the tension lacks the worthiness of the tale.  When  Rachel plants a bugging device in The Gestapo office, I didn't feel the same nerve-wracking ambience of movies such as `Schindler's List' or `Army of Shadows,' (another Nazi resistance movie also based on true stories).  Also, the made-for-TV score didn't give the movie the emotional backdrop it deserved.

The film never seems to be willing to slow down enough for us to really spend some time with these characters to fully appreciate their dilemma; Verhoeven and his screenwriters seem too impatient to get to the next plot twist.

Exploiting the audience as well as trying to portray all the double crossing, greed, nudity and violence that typifies his movies may attract those types of movie goers that are interested in this type of popcorn movie-going experience genre.  This is overall an entertaining movie - a lot of the plot and story lines seems to be not necessarily unique to the setting of the war.  In fact, you could have told this story during almost any war - just change the adversaries, the combatants, and poof - you have a good war movie.  It doesn't feel like there isn't anything new that you haven't seen in other films.

I you are under the age of 10 you may be able to deal with the historical mistakes and convenient coincidences, but otherwise this movie's soft plot will make you cringe.  First of all, conflict is created in the movie when a damaged Allied bomber happens to drop its payload on our heroin's safe house.  Coincidentally, she happens to be talking with a man with a sailboat at the time who is happy to help her escape to his farm with no regard for the risk to him and his family.  Soon afterward she escapes a Nazi ambush on a barge that results in the death of her family.  Although the Germans see her leap into the water they do not really pursue her and she swims away.  Somehow she connects with the resistance (it is never really explained how a wet fugitive in occupied Holland is able to evade the Nazis, find dry clothes, avoid observation and conveniently connect with the resistance).  Soon afterward a halftrack full of armed German troops surprises the resistance team.  Although the group is completely surprised they are able to overpower the troops (and their armored halftrack) and kill them all with no injuries to themselves.  They then decide that the troops ""must have been working on their own"" and that there is no need to worry about more Nazis.  It is never explained nor do they explain how they conveniently get rid of the troops and the halftrack.  There also seem to be no repercussions as a result of these missing troops.  Our heroin then goes on to find a Gestapo officer who is lonely and sympathetic to her hardships.  I could go on and on regarding the ridiculousness of this movie, but I think I have made my point.  For those looking for a good WW2 era suspense movie I would suggest ""Eye of the Needle"" or ""Enigma"".  This one is a loser.",1197158400,23,1798,4.489230769230769

2726542,4,B000M7XRYM,"For a film that was twenty years in the making so-to-speak I was a little disappointed with the one thing that time should have perfected; the script.  If you take the finished product from about twenty minutes in and about twenty minutes shy of the credits you have a near perfect film, intriguing and entertaining and completely absorbing.  If you think about the first and the last twenty minutes though you have frustration, or at least I do.

The beginning is, in my opinion, a little rushed.  I would have loved to have seen Rachel's character fleshed out a little more in the opening sequences, so that I could get a handle on who she really was and what it was in her life that made her the woman we meet.  The ending seems to drag on a bit too long with plot twist after plot twist that could have easily have been condensed in order for more attention to have been given to, say, the beginning of the film.  In all fairness though this is quite an adventurous undertaking, and the concept behind this film could have easily filled a trilogy so fitting so much in a near three hour film is a hard thing to do.  So, when taking this into consideration `Zwartboek' (`Black Book') is really a rewarding spectacle.

The film follows a young Jewish woman named Rachel Stein who witnesses the brutal murder of her family and friends and miraculously survives.  She joins the Dutch Resistance in an attempt to avenge her family's death and in the process becomes involved with two very different yet equally intriguing men.  She is immediately attracted to a member of the Resistance, Hans Akkermans, but she is assigned to infiltrate the Gestapo by seducing SS-Official Ludwig Muntze.  Muntze is charming and handsome and is obviously infatuated with Rachel (who is going by the name of Ellis de Vries) even after uncovering her Jewish heritage.  Rachel manages to uncover information that helps the Resistance but her efforts aren't always met with success and a sudden twist leaves her an enemy of both the Gestapo and the Resistance.

Carice van Houten nails her performance here with grace and empowerment.  I was blown away by her immaculate presence, her determination to the role and her range of varying emotions that transcend words; and when she sings (and yes she did all her own singing) I was in heaven.  She was the perfect complement to Sebastian Koch's magnificence.  Koch is turning out to be my German Russell Crowe, an actor who just holds my attention with every inch of his person.  He's as beautiful to look at as he is to watch perform and this only adds to his magnetism.  His performance as Ludwig Muntze is intense and commanding.  He really makes this man someone we can easily fall in love with, someone we can understand and relate to and want to see more of.  Thom Hoffman also nails his performance as Hans.  He shows a great range of emotions, from infatuation to determination to jealous distain.  Other performances worth recognizing are that of Halina Reijn who plays Rachel's friend Ronnie and Waldemar Kobus who plays Gunther Franken with such flaunted despicability you can't help but be entranced by his presence.

`Zwartboek' is a beautiful film to watch.  Every frame holds your attention and forces you to admire what director Paul Verhoeven is accomplishing (or trying to accomplish) here.  It's sexy and provocative and comes across like a guilty pleasure, which is a very good thing.  The cinematography is just orgasmic, everything feeling so real, a real that only Hollywood can portray.  I do wish that the film were longer, if only to flesh out the story behind the story, the story that is Rachel Stein.  I would have loved to have learnt more about her.  I know that that was not the purpose of the film and I do know that a film should focus on one aspect of a story and not give us so much that we lose interest and or find ourselves lost, I guess I just felt so intrigued by what I saw that I want to know more.

Unfortunately, as far as Verhoeven's influence is concerned, this is more of an action thriller in the vein of Total Recall with a script that reads like Showgirls, rather than a social commentary akin to Starship Troopers or RoboCop. So, think lots of characters being smashed in the face with blunt objects, but without much reasoning. Not that that wasn't the Nazi's modus operandi -- I just expect more from such a great director taking on some very tough subject matter from his homeland. (6/10)",1193616000,5,800,4.640845070422535
2726548,3,B000M7XRYM,"There are two things about Black Book that made me wish I had not spent the time watching it. Number one, the movie starts out several years after the main story. Because of this, we already know the ultimate outcome for the main character, and the suspense of all the travails of that character is blunted.

Number two, the main character's situation and her trials are sympathetic. But the character is played so cool (not completely cold, but definitely cool) emotionally that I did not buy it. She gets in some incredibly tight spots and doesn't really show the tension and strain to make it believable. Not for me, at least. Maybe some people like that kind of a heroine, but honestly Lara Croft shows more humanity sometimes than this gal.

2726549,5,B000M7XRYM,"It is not a straightforward story, not by any means. In the beginning there is a line: based on actual events. Perhaps it is true, maybe life is beyond imagination (or the collective beyond any one person's ability to imagine), things have happened that we can not envision, that truth is stranger than fiction. In any case, this is better than any mystery or whodunit movie i can remember, having those sublime moments where you want to hide your eyes because you know something really bad is going to happen to those sympathetic characters you have come to like but are forced open by the realization that you have no idea of what is going to happen to them and you don't want to miss a second of it. I was frustrated at my inability to guess who was the really bad guy, i was shocked at the chain of events at almost every turn and the twists are just plain devious and demented. It is an excellent mystery, a tormented look into how ordinary people react in extraordinary circumstances, a set historical piece with careful attention to detail and a love story, something for everyone (even as the box says: rated R for strong violence, graphic nudity, sexuality and language) Like i said, something for everyone.

I put it into the category of a must see movie. a 5 star.
there is a very good synopsis of the movie's plot over at the wiki. I could do no better than to encourage people to go read it. Nothing i could write could approach it in completeness. What i'd like to think about is heroes. Especially in the wake of Ken Burn's series on the War, i've been thinking about ordinary people doing heroic things when called upon by extraordinary times. And how so few people seem to be the right kind of heroes. We have lots of heroic efforts in war time, sadly the best and most energies seem to be called out of people when they try to kill each other, or try to survive being killed. The energies of Germany under Hitler ignited Europe, the heroic efforts of people literally burned down and destroyed the work of centuries. Heroes on the American assembly lines of B24's, many or even most women working for the first time out of the house, created waves of thousands of bombers to ignite European and Japanese cities. Heroes on the ground cleaned up the rubble and continued to build their tanks and armaments long after ordinary people would have quit and died. On both sides great heroic energies were called forth out of ordinary people who often rose to the occasion and did things that they themselves could not have imagined just a few years before. Maybe it is the curse of ordinary times that people sleep walk through life never encountering such events that allow them to show what they are really made up of. Maybe it is the salvation of ordinary times that we so seldom encounter such terrible years. But the shame is that they always seem to involve war, never the call to higher ideals and a life of sacrifice to loftier, more noble goals.

In this movie we have examples of three types of people rising far above themselves and entering into that realm of heroes. The key character of Rachel, who is ready to do anything to avenge the cruel death of her family, These are our ""normal"" heroes, those we hold up to future generations and teach them that this is how they ought to act in extraordinary times, knowing full well that we didn't in our day and probably nor will they. Then there is the anti-hero, those heroes literally working for the wrong side, Muntze is this sort of person, trying to negotiate a truce with the Resistance. Daring to love in the midst of what he knows will be a losing war for his side, forcing the truth out of Rachel and using it to try to disarm his sadist and cruel commander. There is another kind of ""hero"" as well, if we think of a hero as an ordinary people who responds in amazing ways to these extraordinary events. These too come wearing  black and white hats, some we recognize and have admired for a long time- the Resistance and those pitifully few Europeans who sheltered the Jews from the Nazi rage and death camps. They are protrayed in the movie, like real people with feet of clay, a farm family with Rachel in the barn allowed to eat if she memorizes a verse of New Testament every day before breakfast. Resistance members who exclaim that 40 good Dutchmen and worth more than any number of blank blank Jews. It is these sympathetic, well drawn, realistic characters that really give this movie depth and interest, that make it a really good movie worth thinking about.

But like the movie, bracketed by two old friend's chance meeting in Israel, the real heroes of the story are women and how they respond to the evil, cruelty and death of war.
Ronnie is the anti-hero for Rachel, the woman who gives into temptation and joins the party. She is the one who survives because she collaborates, she cooperates, she sleeps with the enemy.
But Rachel too sleeps with the enemy, deliberately and with great preparation and seduction, yet she falls in love with the enemy, the ultimate betrayal and hopes to spend the rest of her life with him, if only the fates allow. Where Ronnie takes lightly what life offers, Rachel grabs and holds on for dear life. It is this constant contrast that the movie strives for and is it's big point,  Heroes are ordinary people, doing extraordinary things, all the time demonstrating the mixture of good and evil that lives within us all. Those good Dutch people who pounce upon anyone at the end of the war labelled a collaborator and one almost beats Rachel to death because she stands up to their torment and will not publically strip and humilate herself.  Those women like Ronnie who jump into the Canadian jeeps in the same way they jumped into the Nazi conqueror's 4 years before. It is a protrayal of the clay feet of our heroes, the twisted ways people respond to extraordinary events, each trying to make enough breathing space to keep them and their loved ones alive until ordinary times return.

In the movie we recognize pieces of how we hope we would react to similar events, those heroes who rise well above and beyond, those villains who capitulate and sell out their friends for their own lives, those greed and gold possessed souls who think of nothing but how to steal and escape to live out their lives in comparative wealth and safety. It is the strength of the movie, and it's underlying script that these things are presented to our conscious minds for our consideration and analysis. The stolen blood money from the doubled crossed and butchered wealthy hidden Jews of the Netherlands, planned by a despotic Nazi for his final solution and safe retirement fund and ending up in the hands of the biggest traitor and with his death Rachel's and the Resistance leader's, ends up financing a kibutizum in Israel that finishes the movie being occupied by soldiers fighting yet another new war.  It is these twists and kinks that make for excellent movie watching and rightly make this an extraordinary movie.

A few notes: pay attention to the sounds, even though it is subtitled (you need to turn them on), much of it is in English, but much of it is in several languages simultaneously, a pleasure to listen to.

It is a magicans movie, watch their hands, watch for the disinformation and false leads it presents. Enjoy those moments where you feel you must look away but are rivetted to the screen by the action. Look for the subtle and nearly humorous, whose picture is the microphone hidden behind? What are the store fronts that the Resistance uses? Look for the ironies that make for it's lifelike and realistic feel- the truck serves to avoid hitting street urchins who in turn strip the truck of it's camoflage of food leading the Nazis to the weapons and the death of many Resistance fighters. It is a good movie, i see from the wiki article that a book was written FROM the script, odd i thought that all the best movies were from good novels, maybe a few are from good analysis and retrospect on life itself.",1193529600,13,8046,4.5735090152565885

I especially enjoyed the lengthy narration by Paul Verhoeven, explaining the connection with real events and real people, and the actual sites of the filming process.  I shared it with a friend who was a child in Amsterdam during the German occupation and he also liked it. He did comment that most people of that time were starving and the actors really looked well fed.",1193443200,3,454,4.392857142857143
2726551,3,B000M7XRYM,A good yarn for those who want to see a bit about WW2 resistance efforts in Holland.  Cinematography is high quality but the story is over-acted. Not as good as Soldier of Orange made in 1977 and still the standard bearer of good WW2 films made in Holland for audiences beyond its borders.,1193097600,2,289,4.452830188679245
2726552,5,B000M7XRYM,"""The Black Book,"" Dutch director Paul Verhoeven's newest feature film, and the first he's made after a six-year gap, is also the first he's made in his homeland since the 1970's.  And, surprise, surprise, it's proving every bit as controversial as his earlier works -- best known, ""Robocop,"" (1987), and ""Total Recall,"" (1990), both criticized for excessive violence.  And ""Basic Instinct,""(1992), criticized for excessive violence and prurience.

Verhoeven, working with his frequent collaborator on Dutch films, Gerard Soeteman, is said to have begun writing ""Black Book"" in the 1980's.  He wanted to salute the heroism of those in the Dutch wartime resistance, and Holland's Jews; this he surely did.  He also produced a taut and suspenseful spy thriller, set on the large, color-filled, canvas of his wartime homeland.

After an odd flashback-and-frame opening, the film gives us Rachel Stein (in an outstanding performance by Carice van Houten.)  She's a beautiful, smart Jewish woman, resolute and resourceful, agile in mind and body.  She's waiting for the war's end, everyone is; they all know it's coming.  But before the great day, Allied bombers hit her refuge.  She decides to move on to liberated Belgium, visits the lawyer who's holding her family's assets, and discovers to her amazed joy that her family still survive.  But not for long, unfortunately; the boat on which they set sail to freedom has evidently been betrayed to the Germans, and everyone aboard, excepting her, is murdered, stripped of their assets.  To revenge her family, Rachel finds her way to the resistance, where she will become blonde spy Ellis de Vries, and will be set to penetrate local Gestapo headquarters by any means necessary.  Lucky for her, the local Gestapo comes in the good-looking guise of Captain Ludwig Muntze, (Sebastian Koch, good-looking playwright in the recent Oscar-winning German film, ""The Lives of Others."")  These two will soon surprise themselves by developing feelings for each other that may well fatally complicate their lives.

Some of us could live without the flashback and frame device.  But we must be grateful that the writer-director does not choose to enumerate, one more time, the pettier harassments visited on the Jews before the Germans got really serious.  As to the usual charges: you try making a war movie without scenes of violence.

Prurience?  It's been said that Verhoeven demands his actresses give their all-- you could check it out with Sharon Stone, star of his ""Total Recall,"" and ""Basic Instinct."" However, as to one of the scenes in this movie that upsets the morals monitors, Verhoeven surely didn't invent the concept that collar and cuffs should match.  Ellis tells Muntze that, before the War, she was a Berlin cabaret artist.  Remember the band of blonde showgirls that backed Sally Bowles (Liza Minelli) in ""Cabaret?""  They undoubtedly matched their collars and cuffs.  This world of the Berlin cabaret before the war-- between World Wars I and II, in fact, was the world in which Ellis sung.  That period is known by historians as the Weimar Republic, and the Nazis got their start running against its supposed decadence.

There's another fairly upsetting scene in ""Black Book, "" where it appears that Ellis's friend Ronnie is sexually egging the German troops on, and will earn herself a very unpleasant night for her efforts.  But, by giving her all, she's creating a distraction that will enable Ellis and Muntze to make a getaway. Be that as it may, Van Houten, who is currently playing a major supporting role in GAME OF THRONES, has surely indicated once again that she doesn't mind giving the camera her all.

The Dutch have a reputation in Europe for being down and dirty.  Verhoeven has previously said that they have always been more scientific, interested in detail; certainly less idealistic and more realistic than others.  He added that, if you went back to Holland's art scene 400 years ago, the Dutch were known for their realism even then.  He cites ""Prodigal Son,"" a painting by the Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch, who is known for filling his large canvases, corner to corner, with some pretty colorful, outlandish stuff.  At any rate, ""Prodigal Son"" shows a drunken man relieving himself against a brothel wall.  Bear that in mind, please.",1192752000,9,4311,5.070921985815603
2726553,4,B000M7XRYM,"This was quite an interesting and suspenseful WW2 drama. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland, the film follows Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a Dutch Jew in hiding, as she becomes involved in the Dutch resistance, eventually infiltrating the local Gestapo headquarters by seducing it's Captain, Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch). What follows is a tumultuous odyssey with lots of betrayal, sex, violence, despair, humor, and even love where you would least expect it. Good guys turn into bad guys and vice versa.

Personally, I'm all about graphic (female) nudity so that didn't bother me in the least, although I didn't need to see that much of Franken! Overall, I thought the film was very good although it seemed a bit scattered, and there were a few aspects that seemed a bit stereotypical and/or implausible. These are just minor criticisms though, in an otherwise enjoyable and compelling film. Four stars.

Oh and I almost forgot, Carice van Houten....Yikes! If only I wasn't married my love.",1192406400,4,992,5.117283950617284
2726554,4,B000M7XRYM,"""Black Book"" is a fairly mesmerizing film that succeeds despite Paul Verhoeven's heavy hand.  For sure you like to be entertained but the gravity of World War II means any film depicting it's events, particularly those involving the plight of European Jews, should be dealt with sensitivity.  I mean this is not ""Basic Instinct"" or ""Showgirls"".  Was it necessary to show the film's heroine, a Jew working undercover for the Dutch Resistance, dying her pubic hair in semi-graphic detail?  Later we see prisoners who collaborated with the Germans dumping their excrement in a vat.  Wouldn't you know that moments later that vat's entire contents would be dumped on same heroine.  Steven Speilberg had nudity in ""Schindler's List"" but in a non-exploitive way.  You can't say the same here.  Despite these objections ""Black Book"" works because of it's intricate script that is a tangle of motives on all sides.  For instance, there are sympathetic Germans and duplicitous Resistance members.  There are moments where even the Jewish heroine is suspect.  Verhoeven had a hand in the script so I give him some plaudits there.  Star Carice van Outen is both radiant and compelling as Ellis.  If Verhoeven could have reigned in some of his compulsions this would have been a greater film.",1192147200,3,1280,5.038095238095238
2726555,5,B000M7XRYM,"I won't reiterate the plot here since other reviews have described the film in sufficient detail, but merely want to make a point about Verhoeven's work, that this film in particular helped me see. While ""Black Book"" may seem a far cry from Total Recall, Robocop, Basic Instinct, Showgirls and Starship Troopers (some of Verhoeven's best known Hollywood films) it shares with each of these films Verhoeven's keen insight into what makes a genre film tick and his perverse delight in undercutting and challenging the dichotomies and distinctions that tend to characterize standard genre films. This is Verhoeven's first Dutch film in a long time, and it recalls some of his early films before he went to Hollywood at the same time as it shows his fascination with the way in which films that recall conventional genres carry with them a set of audience expectations that can be played with and twisted.  This film, beautifully shot and with exceptional performances, is an emotional roller coaster in which the viewer gets caught up in the excitement of an escape, then horrified by tragedy, then engaged by romance, then titillated by eroticism, then horrified as the heroine falls in love with someone we are conditioned to hate, then sympathizing with the enemy, then .... and so on.  Verhoeven can make you laugh out loud and a moment later gasp in disgust and then become fascinated and then afraid.  The film is nothing less than wildly entertaining, but at the same time (like all of his films) is underscored by Paul Verhoeven's intriguing brand of humanism: he recognizes and insists that there is no good and evil and that all of us are in some way compromised and yet holds out a hope and a conviction that there is the possibility of heroically, out of love and genuine fellow feeling, rising above the endless intrigue and selfishness and cruel lust and war that he clearly depicts as the dominating force of human experience.  At the same time, he recognizes that this very hope and belief in love and human dignity is a fragile thing because it is so easily manipulated and there are so many who out of greed for power and money will manipulate this hope.  His films remain compelling for continuing to hold out that hope, and for the genuine affection they display for even his most flawed characters.",1191974400,7,2316,4.809045226130653
2726556,3,B000M7XRYM,"Now that he's lost both his DPs (Jan & Jost) and composers (Basil & Jerry), Verhoeven finds himself in a situation not unlike Hitchcock did from Torn Curtain onwards. Choreographed camera-moves and modernist soundscapes make way for academic multi-camera and a mushy score, yet the re-teaming with scriptwriter Soeteman packs some punch and make for an engaging plot, carried along by a stellar cast. Even a minor Verhoeven pic is still fascinating to watch and I had to devour this DVD complete with its trademark commentary.",1191974400,2,526,5.127906976744186

2726558,5,B000M7XRYM,"Paul Verhoeven finally returns to the epic and violent style of filmmaking that he perfected with films like Robocop and Soldier of Orange. Set in World War II, the Dutch director has plenty of open ground to create dastardly villains, tragic heroes and an ill-fated, sweeping romance.

In Nazi-occupied Holland, young Jewish girl Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) is forced into hiding. When her cover is blown she receives help from the Resistance and attempts to travel to liberated territory, but disastrous events find her stranded and alone. Joining up with another Resistance group led by Gerben Kuipers (Derek de Lint), Rachel assumes the name of Ellis de Vries and agrees to spy on Gestapo leader Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch) in order to help plan an escape for several captured allies, including Kuipers' son. Seducing Muntze and working her way into the compound, Ellis slowly uncovers a conspiracy that reveals no one can be trusted and nothing is what it seems.

The hardest concept to bear in Black Book is the theme that the heroine Ellis cannot escape the atrocities of war. Told as a flashback, which hurts the film in that the audience is all too aware of Ellis's fate, Black Book ensures that tragedy is always looming over every character. As a Jewish girl in World War II, Ellis struggles to help those she believes deserve freedom, while seeking activities that will keep her too occupied to recount the loss of her family. She fights deceit from nearly everyone, hatred from her allies, and witnesses ultimate sacrifices by her people, and then as a spy infiltrating the Nazis she encounters equally negative treatment. Always in the wrong place at the wrong time, it is trying on the audience that Verhoeven continues to place her on the losing side. With few wins for the ""good"" guys, the tone of the film is continually depressing.

Disheartening perhaps, but also riveting, as each new challenge promises excitement, suspense, and the burning desire to find out what happens next. Ample foreshadowing permeates Black Book, and it masters one of the most rewarding tricks in film. In several early conversations, bits of seemingly random information are discussed between characters. At first glance, this appears to be filler discourse or merely character development - but later in the film, during climactic moments, that information is recollected and revisited. It's especially thrilling because the audience feels like they are ""in the know"" of a crucial plot device.

Flawless acting all around makes Black Book an easy early contender for several 2007 awards. Carice van Houten is a strong lead and magnificently draws the audience into her world of constant torture and misfortune. But as the twisting plot is steadily unveiled, her tormented character becomes more appealing and interesting, and one of the finest performances of the year emerges. Sebastian Koch also turns in an exceptional performance as the Gestapo leader whose temperament and sympathy betrays him to the real villains. The Resistance members each possess a very different and contrasting demeanor as well, from the tormented Theo to the heroic Hans, and the moral conflicts present within each one enhances the intensity of the drama. As brilliant as the other portrayals are however, none overshadows van Houten's searing performance and her tumultuous plight will resound with the audience long after the film has ended.

""You shouldn't be so trusting. Not in a time like this."" A haunting tale of love, deception, and betrayal, Verhoeven's Black Book mixes the horrors of war with the beauty of a condemned romance and the devastating struggle to survive in a world that has forsaken you. With an Oscar-worthy performance from Carice van Houten and a riveting journey not easily forgotten, Black Book is a must-see film from a seasoned director whose repertoire never ceases to amaze.

2726559,4,B000M7XRYM,"Dutch director Paul Verhoeven always pushes the limits in his films, which makes them stand out.  ""Zwartboek"" or ""Black Book"" won the Best Director Award for him at the Netherlands Film Festival + Best Film and Best Actress Award for Carice van Houten.  The film's episodic structure comes in flashback as we start in Israel in 1956 and then work backward into the war.  This allows the audience to know that the main character Rachel Stein or Ellis DeVries survives.  Van Houten also won the Best Actress Golden Calf Award in the Netherlands in 1999 for ""Suzy Q"" & in 2002 for ""Minoes.""  As Stein/DeVries, she combines luck with an amazing wish for survival that carriers her through the film.  Michael Huisman plays Rob, a young sailor with a boat just as Rachel's hiding place gets bombed.  Sebastian Koch plays the German commander Ludwig Muntze that DeVries befriends.  Their physical relationship grows beyond convenience and survival into a touchingly beautiful love.  Muntze is a dashing romantic lead.  Thom Hoffman plays Hans Akkermans that we think is a good guy for much of the film, until we see him try to kill Ellis with an insulin injection.  Hoffman plays the good guy/villain with rugged abandon.  Halina Reign plays Ronnie that Ellis meets while working for the Nazis & trying to get intelligence for them.

Inspired by true events, the film mixes tense drama, action, and the flirtatious acting of van Houten to give an enjoyable two-hour plus of entertainment.

Much of the attention regarding Black Book has centered on the sexy performance of van Houten, and she is the center of the film.  She in turn can be perky, cute, serious, and pensive, all while looking like a million bucks.

The film explores the complex setting of the German occupation of the country in World War II.  Not all of the Resistance was as noble and mythical as popular memory would have it, and not all of the Germans were vile, disgusting pigs.  The plot has more than a few twists and turns, leading to a payoff in the end.

As an aside, one nice thing about the film is the casualness it treats adult men and women in love and lust.  Adult subjects handled in adult ways is a refreshing idea.

There is quite a lot of violence and violent images in the film, but all central to the plot.  The movie is subtitled but they are easy to read and are not obtrusive.

The director's commentary is illuminating and interesting to listen to Paul Verhoeven's dissection of the movie as it rolls in real time.  Mr. Verhoeven was a young boy during the war and remembers some of the events depicted in the film.

2726564,5,B000M7XRYM,"Just when we think we have read about or seen all of the stories there are to tell about courageous heroes/heroines who sacrificed much for the sake of many during World War II, along comes BLACK BOOK (ZWARTBOEK) with another dramatic 'biography' of a significant figure.  Director Paul Verhoeven (Basic Instinct, Spetters, Total Recall) is a much admired Dutch artist who is able to draw his audience into another world so real that it literally feels as though we are part of the process. And that is precisely why this film works so well: the audience as a participant drives home the film's message that war changes people, that from one day to the next it is impossible to distinguish the 'bad' from the 'good', the 'enemy' from the 'friend'.

Rachel Stein (the enormously gifted Carice van Houten) was a Jewish Dutch born cabaret singer in Berlin until the war broke out, at which time she returned to Holland to hide during the Jewish Solution.  A series of incidents in 1944 destroy her hiding place and thwart her attempts to join her family to escape the Nazis.  She is left to fend by herself until she bonds with a group from the Dutch Resistance.  Gaining their confidence she is asked to masquerade as a German singer, dye all of her body hair blond, enter Germany as the consort of a doctor Hans Akkerman (Thom Hoffman) and infiltrate the highest elements of the Nazi regime, namely to become the mistress of Gestapo head Ludwig M&uuml;ntze (Sebastian Koch) changing her name to Ellis de Vries. She stays in contact with the Resistance, places microphones in strategic positions, and with her friend Ronnie (Halina Reijn) becomes a Nazi party girl, singing at events while assisting her colleagues underground.  The story is complex with many surprises as to who is with the Nazis and who is with the Resistance, and the story is so well told that we the audience are left guessing identities much the same as the characters.

Paul Verhoeven wrote the screenplay with Gerard Soeteman and Verhoeven's dedication to his story is always present.  There is a considerable violence and some sections that may offend viewers, but try to tell a true war story without including such aspects!

The cast is brilliant, especially the multi-talented Carice van Houten, easily one of the finest actresses on the screen today. The entire cast is includes such gifted actors as Waldemar Kobus, Derek de Lint, Christian Berkel, Dolf de Vries, Michiel Huisman and Ronald Armbrust.  The cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub recreates not only The Hague, Holland, and Germany but also a kibbutz in Israel with solid veracity. Anne Dudley has created a musical score that includes songs from the period (sung beautifully by Carice van Houten), and atmospheric scoring for the tender scenes as well as the many tense scenes.

Released in Europe in 2006, it is not clear as to whether this film will be eligible for the Oscars this year.  If it is it should win.  It is one of the finest films this reviewer has seen in a long time. In Dutch, German, Hebrew, and English with subtitles.  Highly Recommended!

2726565,5,B000M7XRYM,"As many here have said, this is a beautifully shot, gripping, unforgettable movie, a great addition to the honorable genre of WWII flicks.  In fact, the father of one of my colleagues, Dutch himself and in his 70s, said this was the best film he has ever seen.  So I don't understand why, if a man in his 70s who is from the WWII generation himself did not find this film ""prurient,"" so many reviewers have insisted that it is.  The scene that most of the prudes seem to find gratuitous is (spoiler alert) the scene in which the Jewish heroine prepares herself to pass as a blonde bombshell so she can seduce the German officer.  Clearly, she is going to have to dye or shave hair other than the hair on her head in order to pass as a natural blond.  The movie shows her doing this.  Why is it not gratuitous?  Because the scene sets up the love triangle that will result in the conflict in the last third of the movie.  It is absolutely essential to the advancement of the plot, and in my opinion, any reviewer who can't see that is not only a fussy old woman, but also not much of a reviewer.  So if you have not seen this movie because you've read a review that trashes it on the grounds of prurience, please reconsider.  And consider this:  the most recent Ang Lee movie is so sexually frank that it got an NC-17 rating, yet there hasn't been a single review which has trashed it on the basis of its gratuitous sex.  That says to me that some major reviewers are only interested in criticizing Paul Verhoeven rather than commenting honestly on his film.  Another reason to see this movie is Carice Van Houten.  She not only convincingly plays a 40's bombshell, she has that same 40s movie-star quality that you can't take your eyes off of.  Truly, you could watch this film 100 times and never get tired of her.  She is irresistible.",1190851200,244,1837,4.358823529411764
2726566,5,B000M7XRYM,"4 of 4 people found the following review helpful:

Mata Hari and Greta Garbo move over; Rachel Stein a.k.a. Ellis de Vries is the new girl in town, and she is positively fearless!

Paul Verhoeven, whose American film making career gave us such films as BASIC INSTINCT and ROBO COP, has returned to his native Netherlands to co-write and direct his ""piece de resistance"" (literally!) in his exhilarating and relentlessly thrilling BLACK BOOK.In BLACK BOOK Verhoeven has created a Resistance fighter/spy/seductive vixen heroine for the ages in Rachel Stein. She is a one-of-a-kind, and Dutch actress Carice van Houten probably has made her most important career choice in portraying her.

Though The film begins on a Kibbutz in 1956 Israel where we meet a song singing teacher named Rachel Stein who chances upon an old friend from the War days,a former Nazi whore named Ronnie, Rachel's memory quickly takes us from the peaceful kibbutz back to the horrors of WW2 in 1944 Holland. This is where the story of Rachel Stein really begins.

As a Jewish woman in Holland, Rachel Stein has been forced into hiding with a Dutch family in order to fly under the radar of the terror of the Nazi Occupation and the compliant Dutch Police. When the family's farm is bombed ,Rachel is forced by circumstance to begin a long line of improvisations to simply stay alive. She is gorgeous,incredibly resourceful and absolutely and unapologetically opportunistic as she,instead of waiting out the War in seclusion, boldly goes forth right under the noses of the Nazis,changing her persona to Ellis de Vries,a platinum-blonde former Berlin cabaret star ,relying on her incredible female powers,beauty (and she is!) genius and courage and takes the Nazi Terror on. Ellis finds her niche with the Dutch resistance which asks her to land smack into the arms of a head Gestapo officer,Ludwig Muntze,(Sebastian Koch).She becomes the Resistance's chief spy as she plays whore to a Muntze,who falls heartily and hard for the magnificent and charming Ellis. What was simply a spy job,though,now changes drastically as Ellis and Ludwig really do fall in love. This is where the final and most difficult task lies for Ellis (and that is all this reviewer is giving away!)

Carice van Houten is an absolute rare find and no doubt the job that she so admirably does in infusing Rachel/Ellis with such depth,complexity and grit will land her all kinds of accolades and awards in the year to come. Ms van Houten takes the courageous yet fleeing Jewess Rachel and transfigures her into the ever resourceful,luminesque-Garbolike Ellis taking her into the world of roller coaster nightmares that leaves the viewer positively out of breath (and I was!)

Sebastian Koch,fresh from his sucess in the 2006 Foreign Oscar winner THE LIVES OF OTHERS is even MORE convincing as Gestapo officer Muntze in BLACK BOOK.This is an actor of such depth that coupled with van Houten and a flawless script and deft direction, BLACK BOOK is going to be hard to top for the 2007 Oscar. With such a glut of overused and underachieved American ""stars"",van Houten and Koch are actors' actors and hopefully will keep making smart decisions to act only the finest material under the best direction. Watching these actors makes one wonder why Americans fawn over some of the ""fluff"" stars we do?

What is neat about BLACK BOOK is that Verhoeven never gives the audience one minute of rest. He, though, never allows BLACK BOOK to become just another action-packed spy thriller; instead he gives us an incredibly deep and detailed story,set among the darkest days in war torn Europe that is character-rich,plot-exploding with great visual sense and style. BLACK BOOK is Verhoeven at his most mature. His last Dutch film,the 1983 thriller THE FOURTH MAN,though alright,followed by his American films,puts BLACK BOOK at the top of his distinguished directorial list.

Anne Dudley,who heretofore was known to this reviewer for her classical-style music, HYMNS ANCIENT AND MODERN, has composed a compelling and riveting soundtrack that never overtakes any of the story,but cleverly moves the action along-the chief goal of a score writer.

It is hard to believe that this film was 2 and 1/2 hours long! It flew by. BLACK BOOK is rated R and contains nudity,violence and coarse profanity.

Great companion films on WW2 Netherlands would be THE HIDING PLACE and A DAY IN OCTOBER .It seems to me that THE NAZI OFFICER'S WIFE ,which is the true story of Edith Hahn's transfiguration from hiding Jewess into a Officer's wife may well have been the ""true events"" that inspired the screenplay for BLACK BOOK.The similarities are uncanny making BLACK BOOK all the better for it.

2726567,4,B000M7XRYM,"""Black Book"" (co-written by the director with Gerard Soeteman) is native Hollander Paul Verhoeven's first Dutch language film in quite a long while. There is an entire generation of moviegoers who can quote lines from ""Basic Instinct "", ""Robocop "" or ""Starship Troopers"" but have never heard of ""Spetters "", ""The 4th Man"" or ""Soldier of Orange"".

""Black Book"" is a ""Mata Hari"" style tale set in Holland in the waning days of the German occupation, as the Allies make their post-D-Day push across Europe. Carice van Houten gives a compelling performance as a former chanteuse named Ellis, a Dutch Jew who has spent the occupation in hiding with a sympathetic farm family. When her hosts are obliterated in a bombing raid, Ellis is left with the realization that she will now have to live by her wits if she is to survive (""The Sound of Music"" meets ""Showgirls""? Discuss.)

After a series of harrowing escapes and misadventures, Ellis finds herself in the Dutch Resistance. As part of a plan to spring some imprisoned Resistance fighters, she is asked to seduce the commander of the local SS detachment, Colonel Muntze (Sebastian Koch, in a nicely fleshed out performance). Things get a little complicated when Ellis begins to develop a genuine attraction to Muntze.

This is a genuinely exciting war adventure, with interesting plot twists along the way (along with a few of those patented over-the-top Verhoeven moments, usually involving fearless nudity and gore). It's refreshing to see Verhoeven escaping from Hollywood and getting back to his roots;while I generally enjoy his big budget popcorn fare, I have always felt his Dutch films were much more challenging and substantive (Verhoeven the Hired Hand vs. Verhoeven the Auteur, if you will).",1190678400,10,1749,5.044982698961937
2726568,5,B000M7XRYM,"One of my special interests is WW II history, especially the Nazi era, and I have watched many fact-based movies dealing with the theme. Black Book is a first-rate thriller that depicts the trials and tribulations of a young Jewish woman in Nazi-occupied Holland. Rachel Stein the lead character is played consummately by the beguiling Carice Van Houten whose facial expressions do a lot more to convey fear, vulnerability, hatred and determination than mere dialogue alone. To ensure her continued survival and escape from certain death that awaits the Jewish populace, Rachel, having suffered the loss of her brother and parents, takes on the guise of an Aryan, Ellis de Vries, and is roped by the Resistance to seduce Ludwig Muntze [Sebastian Koch] a Gestapo officer and steal Nazi secrets.

The actors in this movie are well-cast - even the Gestapo officer, whose very title should inspire revulsion is portrayed with a certain sensitivity, and he shows a semblance of humanity, a rare trait for an officer of the Reich. Even knowing Rachel's true Jewish identity, he falls hopelessly in love with her, and this is portrayed with a level of credibility given the contradictions inherent in such a pairing.

The action is fast-paced, there is much violence, and yes, even explicit sex, but through it all, nothing detracts from the plot, only serves to enhance the story, and makes this a gripping, must-see WW II thriller.",1190592000,82,1426,5.012658227848101
2726569,4,B000M7XRYM,"The Black Book"" tells the story of a Dutch-Jewish girl, Rachel Stein, who works for the resistance in Nazi-occupied Holland during the final days of World War II.

The film starts and finishes on a Kibbutz in Israel in 1956. A tourist, Ronnie (Halina Reijn) wis visiting Israel with her Canadian husband who she met during the liberation of Holland, when she is delighted and surprised to recognise the heroine (Carice van Houten) who had been a friend during the war, teaching at the Kibbutz school.

After Ronnie and her husband have gone, van Houten's character begins to reminisce to the circumstances leading up to her first meeting with Ronnie, and the viewer follows her thoughts back to September 1944 when she was hiding from the Nazis under her real name of Rachel Stein.

Rachel was a former famous singer from a wealthy Jewish family, who went into hiding when the Germans over-ran Holland. A stray bomb wrecks Rachel's hiding place, but someone who claimss to be working for the Resistance gives her the opportunity to flee. However, the group Rachel is travelling with are betrayed. Surviving by chance, she meets up with a different group of the resistance and begins to work for them, dying her hair blonde and taking the false name Ellis de Vries. After several of her friends in the resistance are captured, Resistance cell leader Gerben Kuipers (Derek de Lint) asks Ellis what she would do to help them: he asks if she will seduce SS leader Ludwig Mntze (Sebastian Koch). At his HQ she meets Ronnie, who is working there as a genuine collaborator - or is she ?

From quite early in the film, the viewer begins to suspect that one or more characters who appears to be in the resistance or trying to help the Jews are actually traitors working for the Germans. You also begin to wonder if the people in the Nazi HQ include more Allied agents who Kuipers' resistance cell don't know about. However, the twists and turns in the complex plot of the film keep you constantly wondering who is betraying whom.

Some of the nastiest scenes in the film come after the liberation, because the final revenge of one of the Nazis is to trick the resistance into thinking that Rachel/Ellis has betrayed them. The ""Black Book"" of the title contains the evidence which eventually shows who the real traitors were.

Most of the spoken words in the film are in Dutch or German, with subtitles, except for a few lines towards the end of the film where the mostly Canadian liberation forces finally arrive. I hardly noticed that I was picking up the meaning from the subtitles, nor rapid fire switch of the dialogue between English and Dutch with subtitles towards the end (though I did notice that one or two people who were supposed to be Canadians had distinctly British accents.)

I can't make up my mind whether it was a good idea to bookend the film with the scenes on the Kibbutz in 1956. This tells you right at the beginning that Rachel/Ellis and Ronnie will survive and removes an element of suspense, though I was still wondering ""How on earth does she get out of this one"" for most of the film.

There is also a shock ending to the final 1956 segment. This does not relate well to the main story of the book, and appears to have been added to remind the viewer, regardless of your view of the Arab-Israel disputes, that for those who were born Jewish, facing prejudice and conflict did not end with the defeat of the nazis.

There is an enormous amount of nudity in the film: both Carice van Houten and Halina Reijn have magnificent bodies and both display them quite a lot. However, the nudity is always in context, and that context is usually painful or humiliating - e.g. when Rachel has to pretend to enjoy showing her breasts to a nazi pig who organised the murder of people she loved - so the nudity appears to be mainly intended to make a point rather than to titillate.

There is also some excellent music, including four contemporary songs sung by Carice van Houten, as she also performed them as Rachel Stein in the film. Three of them are in German, one in English

There is very little humour in the film: there are a couple of light-hearted exchanges at the beginning before tragedy strikes, and later there are two variants on the ancient ""Is that a gun in your pocket or are you pleased to see me?"" joke. Generally it's a very serious and rather sad film.

Compared with the low standard of plausibility of war thrillers in general much of this film scored quite highly for credibility and realism, though there were inevitably a few things I found it hard to believe could happen. Most of the time it is not difficult to suspend disbelief in the story.

Some excellent acting, especially from Carise va Houton as the central figure. De Lint as the resistance leader, Kock as a very complex Nazi figure, and Dolf de Vries as a notary who appears to be helping Jews escape give particularly powerful performances. Waldemar Kobus plays the horrible Gnther Franken, a Nazi captain who clearly takes a delight in murdering Jews and robbing them, and Thom Hoffman plays Hans Akkermans, a doctor working for the resistance.

Director and screenplay author Paul Verhoeven has said that

""In this movie, everything has a shade of grey. There are no people who are completely good and no people who are completely bad. It's like life.""

I agree that this describes the vast majority of characters in the film, though there are one or two who do come over as pure evil, notably Gunther Franken, and SS general Kutner, played by Christian Berkel.

Unless you like watching very sad films, this is probably one to rent rather than buy: I cannot imagine that I will want to watch it all that often. Most of the apparently sympathetic characters get killed, some of the rest turn out to be traitors, and overall the story is quite depressing. However, it is powerful, sexy, sophisticated, well made, and memorable.",1189814400,16,5925,4.649139579349904
2726570,5,B000M7XRYM,"Sauntering over to the Music Box in Chicago to see a Robert Altman film one Saturday morning, traffic delayed me so much that I got there well into the Altman film, but in time to see ""Black Book"" which I really hadn't planned to see having been burned out on Holocaust films. But am I glad I did see it. It is unlike any Holocaust film I'd ever seen before. I loved it so much that I dragged my wife to see it the next Friday night -- and she loved it too!

I hadn't planned on ever seeing this amazing film, but it blew me away. I am going to try very hard to avoid revealing any spoilers because one of the great things about this adventurous, fast-moving tale of survival is all the twists and turns it takes. Our heroine can never really be sure who is one which side. Some good guys turn out to be bad guys; some bad guys turn out to be good guys; and some just stay the same. This is the sort of film that doesn't waste a scene. Pay attention ... because things that are said early on may come back later in the film.

Beyond that, I don't want to reveal anything else. While I still think this is the best film I've seen all year (it's now early Sept 2007), I realize it may not be everybody's cup of tea. But if you like a film that totally engages you, goes places you don't expect it to go, never has a dull moment, is incredibly well-acted especially by Carice van Houten, very well directed, and offers great inspiration and insight into the lengths ordinary people will go to survive against all odds (that's not a spoiler because not everybody survives against all odds in this film), then ""Black Book"" is for you.",1188864000,13,1629,4.201277955271565
2726571,5,B000M7XRYM,"This is an amazing WWII movie! A Jewish woman joins the Dutch resistance, and the combination of action/thriller with the human drama of complex characters  in this war-time situation is, in my opinion, mind-blowing. This is not to be missed!",1188691200,4,242,5.05
2726572,5,B000M7XRYM,"Finally taking on World War II and it's effects on the nation of Holland, Paul Verhoeven is back. He hasn't really dealt with this type of material since ""Soldier of Orange"" decades ago. His last film was the abysmal Hollywood sci-fi movie ""Hollow Man"". So now Verhoeven returns to the arthouse cinema, first time in many years. His ballsy style is in full evidence once again, filled with action, violence and sex but not gratuitously used like he sometimes does. The story is filled with twists, turns and many surprises, never disappointing in the area of entertainment. Some may claim that this is a Hollywood film masquerading as an arthouse flick but don't be so quick to judge. Hollywood would quickly sanitize an audacious film like this if they had a chance to produce it, that's why Verhoeven went back to Europe to make this film.

As most reviewers have already summarized the necessary plot points, I won't dwell on them. Just wanted to write this review and say that Verhoeven is back as a director to watch! Hopefully his next film will be more ambitious and contain the same type of great storytelling but brought to different subject matter. So, go out and rent or buy Black Book if you care about this filmmaker or if you just like World War II movies in general. Although this film contains it's many cliches, at least it shows that not all Germans were evil. Sebastian Koch is the male lead alongside the lead character played by Carice van Houten.

The title of this film is a bit random as this so called Black Book has little to do with most of the movie and acts as a sort of problem solving plot point near the end. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a deus ex machina. In conclusion, a very entertaining film indeed and a return to form for this director. For the record, my favorite Paul Verhoeven film is and probably always will be... ROBOCOP.",1188691200,11,1872,4.535502958579881

THE YOUNG WOMAN PLAYING THE LEAD, CARICE VAN HOUTEN, IS A DUTCH VERSION OF KATE BLANCHETTE. THEY ARE BOTH BRILLIANT ACTORS. THE STORY OF HER SURVIVAL IS A STRONG ONE, AND THE PERFORMANCES OF ALL THE ACTORS WERE INCREDIBLY WELL CRAFTED. AN EXCELLENT SCRIPT, AN EXCELLENT CAST AND WITH PAUL VERHOVEN AS THE DIRECTOR THIS FILM IS A MUST SEE.

2726575,4,B000M7XRYM,"Director Paul Verhoeven stunned the film world with his World War II masterpiece ""Soldier of Orange""...and in a sense, this film is a second
installment of his story of the Dutch Resistance.  In the earlier film it was easier to distinguish the evil from the good...here characters are edgier and perhaps darker.

The story begins when a young, pretty Jewish woman tries to flee to Belgium from Nazi occupied Holland but her family is betrayed, massacred and robbed along with other Jewish families.  After a nail-biting escape,
Rachel (Carice Van Houten), joins the Resistance and agrees to infiltrate the Gestapo headquarters.  Surprisingly, she becomes attached to one of the officers, and the tale begins a spin into betrayal and counterbetrayal...so that enemies and friends are very hard to distinguish.

There is a lot of old-fashioned World War II suspense and action that
rolls the story along.  But ultimately, this is a film about how hard it is to identify villains and heroes, when everyone is wearing a mask...including Rachel,of course - who is hiding her Jewish identity.

Overall, the film sizzles more than Soldier of Orange, but the original World War II film is still the better steak. Recommended for the high octane action, interesting plot twists, and solid historical detail.",1185753600,78,1299,5.127962085308057
2726576,4,B000M7XRYM,"Director Paul Verhoeven returns to his native Holland after more than 20 years (his last film there was 1983's The Fourth Man) and the result is a cinematic treat, probably his best film since Robocop. Both outrageous and exhilarating, Black Book tells the story of a Jewish singer (the excellent Carice Van Houten) and her improbable travails in occupied Holland during World War II. After spending a great part of the occupation hidden by some anti-Semitic farmers, her hiding place is bombed by the British towards the end of the war. She decides it's time to reunite with her family and escape with the help of some dubious people to allied-liberated Belgium. But there is an obvious betrayal during the escape and her whole family (along with other refugees) are killed by the Germans (she escapes miraculously by jumping into the water,007-style). After that, she joins the resistance, and a series of improbable situations occurs. When the son of one of the resistance leader is arrested, she is encouraged to seduce the German SS bigwig (whom she had met earlier on a train) so as to install a microphone inside the Nazi headquarters and help the resistance liberate the young man (the idea of a Jew becoming a lover of a high Nazi officer is, of course, highly offensive to many; the Nazi, by the way, is played by the fine actor who was the playwright in The Lives of Others). Many improbable things happen after wards, with incredible turns of events to the story happening at about every ten minutes, punctuated by deadly shootings between the Nazis and the Dutch resistance. The movie is 2hours and 25 minutes long, probably half an hour too much (it should have ended when Holland is liberated and she receives a less than stellar reception). It's impossible to take the movie very seriously (the movie claims to be based in true events, but this is almost certainly not true), but is extremely entertaining, and it shows Verhoeven at the top of his game.",1183334400,2,1969,4.794117647058823
2726577,4,B000M7XRYM,"Anyone who has seen Soldaat van Oranje (soldier of Orange) will want to see Zwartboek (Black Book) by Paul Verhoeven.  The cast names will not be familiar, but all actors are quite competent.  It is the story of a young Jewish female singer and entertainer who barely survives the massacre of a boat load of Jewish refugees by the SS when they attempt to escape to Belgium from Holland during 1944.  She links up with the Dutch Resistance as a spy and insinuates herself into the good graces of a German officer who eventually shows himself to be a good guy reminiscent of the good German in The Pianist.  The plot involves many plots and counterplots and moles and betrayals that do not need to be revealed here.  Verhoeven is a gifted director and the movie is beautifully put together.  There is quite a bit of good music in refreshing contrast to most American movies.  The cinematography is excellent.  The language is Dutch with English subtitles except for a few scenes in German or English.  It is long, but you will have no trouble staying awake.",1180569600,18,1055,4.629032258064516
