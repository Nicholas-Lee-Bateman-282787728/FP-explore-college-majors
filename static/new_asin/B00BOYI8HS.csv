5662957,5,B00BOYI8HS,"Just finished reading the book and, the gist of it was in this movie.  Vivien Leigh has always been a favorite; she gives a poignant portrayal of Anna.  I have seen the BBC Masterpiece Theatre version as well and I prefer the classic version.  I believe most of the classic versions are more gentile.  For example I recently saw an early version of Titanic, with Barbara Stanwyck.  I thought it strangely interesting that once the general population of the ship was aware of its eminent demise, they all seemed to take their fate in stride.  No one screamed, no one acted frantically; they just all obeyed the crew and ""stayed calm"" and moved in an orderly fashion while putting on their life jackets and moving to the boats.  Even as the people, who were in the life boats, watched the Titantic sink, no one did much more than look astonished or cried.  So, this version of Anna Karenina is a gentler version but you still get the ""big picture"" of just how much she gave up for the love of man.",1411084800,2,995,4.458563535911602

5662960,4,B00BOYI8HS,"CLASSIC CHARM FROM A GOLDEN ERA OF FILM MAKING

1948 Karenina with Vivien Leigh and Kieron Moore
With all our advancements in cinema, we still may have not seen a more elegant Anna than Vivien Leigh nor a more dashing Vronsky than Kieron Moore.  I think the yearning in the early development of their relationship was also most palpable in this version (nearly 70 years old - time of writing this).  The scene where Vronsky and Anna acknowledge their love to each other is extraordinary.  It is set at an Opera after-party in Karenin's home where the guests are about to hold a sance and summon the spirit of a famous female lover.  Anna and Vronsky have gone to the side as the lights are turned down.  The moment where Anna sits with her tea, looking up into the camera (with that face!) and Vronsky turns to look at her, his eyes in the light but his face shadowed - one of the great cinematic pauses of all time!  Beautifully romantic.  This black and white production accomplishes what many modern ones cannot in the same run time.  The charm and style are different with classic movies and they have to be judged on their own merits.  For a long novel, this movie manages to maintain character development and plot connections that are often superficial in other attempts.  It takes tremendous skill and effort to do that.  Even though it is not my favorite above all others, it has some of my favorite moments and a merit of its own that will always survive.

BRIEF COMPARISONS TO OTHER EDITIONS with links to the product  (this list is not comprehensive and I apologize if a favored version is not represented.  I already watched nearly 24 hrs of video not counting research and writing!)  This list is not in order of precedence and each version has merits.  You can see slightly more detailed versions of my reviews like the paragraph above by going to each product page.

The Gold Standard of adaptations even after so many years.  Despite the 70's BBC acting style, this version has aged well with tremendous faithfulness to the book and ideas behind it.  Performances are melodramatic to today's audience, but so good they are relevant.  It is still my favorite rendition.  You must be up for nearly 10 hrs worth of story though.

This version is the next longest I viewed and fairly faithful to the plot and spirit of the book.  The acting style is more natural (less stage play melodramatic) and the entire focus seems to be on a realistic portrayal.  Lead actors less compelling than I would have liked.  This version will still be some peoples' favorite.  It is not mine.

Most visually stunning of the traditional adaptations, gorgeous cinematography and recognizable stars galore.  Despite all the stars, acting is uneven and accents all over the place.  Choppy story flow.  Still one of my favorites!

Shortened or edited version is somewhat lifeless though the flow is less choppy than other adaptations.  Badly in need of a restoration in video/sound quality and return of the lost footage not found in any copies I know of.

This is not for Tolstoy traditionalists!  However, the stunning visuals and choreographed set pieces really are brilliant.  It is set like a stage play and tends to swirl around a lot.  I hated it the first time because I wanted something else.  Understanding it better, I like it more.",1404691200,14,4450,5.863141524105754
5662961,4,B00BOYI8HS,A proper rendering of the novel & Vivien Leigh nearly equals her portrayal of Scarlett O'Hara but somehow this just one doesn't quite make it - perhaps because it's nearly impossible to condense this novel to film?  My favorite rendering of one of my favorite novels remains the Greta Garbo film because there's no doubt SHE was Anna!,1403222400,4,334,4.758620689655173
8571979,5,B00BOYI8HS,I have always loved the book and the movie.  The remastered version was well done and magnificent!,1501200000,,98,4.764705882352941
8571980,5,B00BOYI8HS,"This is a magnificent film so I've given it five stars.  But the quality of the print is absolutely miserable.  Certainly this has NOT been digitally remastered.  You can hardly make out what is happening in some of the dark shadowy moments and the beautiful music, unfortunately, is shrill.  This film truly deserves to be fully restored. It may be the best ""Anna Karenina"" on film in English that we have.  I hope and pray that the restoration will come soon so more people can enjoy this version.  -----  It offers an extraordinarily good script, really capturing the key moments of Anna's story.  --- Vivian Leigh is highly effective as the tortured Anna, swept off her feet by an uninvited love.  Her passion and her despair are believable right to the finish.  ---  Her Vronsky is excellent; and Ralph Richardson gives the tragic dimension to her ""wronged"" husband.  The minor roles, Kitty, Dolly, Stiva, are all superbly done.  ---  Not enough attention is given  to Constantine Levin, but then no version of ""Anna Karenina"" ever really does right by Levin, who is in fact, the hero of the novel.  This version at least gives you some idea of who Levin is and why Kitty would love him, and seek to make up for her having rejected him.  ---",1500422400,,1246,4.6422018348623855

8571987,5,B00BOYI8HS,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore; what a gem.

IMHO an iconic film. That was the genius of the old Hollywood system; in spite of all its flaws. They understood how to distill a story down to its essence, no matter how complicated the original text may have been.
Ralph Richardson and Vivian Leigh are of course masterful and the supporting cast of character actors are flawless.

It used to be a great honor to be a really good character actor; they were indispensable, but nowadays everybody wants top billing and frankly a lot of those old character actors could outshine many of todays stars.

The approach to filmmaking has changed dramatically of course and in many cases it simply doesn't work.
The new versions of films such as ""Wuthering Heights"" for example tries to be ""true"" in detail to the last iota and it is tedious and painful sitting there going through that whole multi generational thing being dragged out to the bitter end.

Really, I think even the Bronte's would have said enough already.",1425513600,3,1020,4.713483146067416
