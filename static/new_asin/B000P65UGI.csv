8189127,4,B000P65UGI,"Looked long and hard for some HarveyToons that were unedited.  Well good luck!  But this VHS collection features 9 Herman and Katnip cartoons from 1952-58.  Featured are MICE CAPADES, OF MICE AND MAGIC (my favorite), HERMAN THE CATOONIST, DRINKS ON THE MOUSE, NORTHWEST MOUSIE, SURF AND SOUND, OF MICE AND MENACE, SHIP A-HOOEY, and YOU SAID A MOUSEFUL.  The catchy opening song is featured in its completeness on the opening cartoon.  On subsequent offerings it's chizzeled down to the last few bars.  Unfortunately, the closing credits are lopped off, and it fades to a new cartoon.  But the last cartoon has the ending credits.  On VHS, not DVD.  If you look carefully on AMAZON, you can find a copy.",1377043200,,702,4.831932773109243
