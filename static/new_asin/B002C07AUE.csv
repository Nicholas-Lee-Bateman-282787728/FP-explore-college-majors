3902606,5,B002C07AUE,"I wonder where they dug up some of these shows. Many are part of the TV history but many did not last long. In some cases they started out a serials that played in the movie theaters. Once TV came of age they made these serials in to half hour shows. Another area where these shows started out was the radio. The Lone Ranger, which got it's start as a weekly  radio show, was then turned in to a TV series as well as Gun smoke.",1358899200,2,427,3.9651162790697674

3902608,4,B002C07AUE,"The four gunmen in the title, led by Rory Calhoun, rob a bank and are escaping to Mexico when they decide to help a damsel in distress and her father from being butchered and scalped by an attacking group of Indians who escaped from the reservation. It happened this way:

 The four gather in a run-down place outside of a town to plan their proposed robbery of the town's bank. They decide that Calhoun should go to town and create a disturbance to draw the inhabitants, including the town sheriff, far from the bank, by provoking fist fight with the sheriff. The sheriff was once his friend, but later drove him from town.

During the discussion, a father and his beautiful, nave, and somewhat childish daughter arrive. Calhoun grabs a kiss from the girl when her father is not looking, and she falls in love with him. She almost allows him to rape her, but her father saves her.

The bank robbery is successful. We watch the town people, who know Calhoun well, react to him. We hear them say that they think that he could have turned out well if he had a woman, just as the sheriff has. The four are riding to Mexico when they see Indians attacking the father and daughter. Calhoun abandons the money the group stole and rides off to help. The other three join him. Meanwhile the sheriff and a posse are chasing the four to capture them.

Viewers will wonder what happens to the four, the father, and daughter. Will the sheriff catch them? Will the daughter persuade Calhoun to abandon crime? How will she do it?

Viewers will have a chance to see Jay Silverheels in this 1954 film. Jay later played Tonto in the Lone Ranger series. Here he is one of the four gunmen, a cat loving, and knife-wielding thief.",1299801600,5,1710,4.482315112540193
3902609,3,B002C07AUE,"Essentially, this is simply a four disc repackaging of Timeless Media's larger six disc set titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Classic-TV-Western-Collection-EMBOSSED-COLLECTOR-S-TIN/dp/B0021FP2RI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Classic TV Western Collection - EMBOSSED COLLECTOR'S TIN!</a>&nbsp;which includes two additional discs of licensed TV Westerns from NBC Universal like LARAMIE, WAGON TRAIN, and others.  Even the discs in this set are numbered three through six, despite the fact that the description on the back of the clam case indicates discs one through four.

In some respects, this is a fairly typical packaging of TV Westerns as you'll see some episodes that have appeared on other DVD collections from different DVD companies.  Notable examples include ""Day of the Hunter"" from THE RIFLEMAN and ""Return of the Canary Kid"" from SUGARFOOT, among a few others.  These are episodes that have fallen into the public domain and anyone with copies of public domain episodes can release them.  But there are some rarities on this disc, including the entire fourth disc titled ""The Lost Westerns"" that, to the best of my knowledge, have not been previously released on commercial DVD.  So, in that respect, this set is worth owning for fans of TV Westerns.  I had not seen YANCY DERRINGER since I was a child, so it was great to see the show again, even if it was just a single episode.  Beware of the HIGH CHAPPARAL episode (possibly making its commercial DVD debut), as it is presented here in black & white and not in color as originally filmed.

For the most part, audio/visual quality is about what you would expect for a set of mostly public domain episodes.  There are a few bright spots on the set like THE TEXAN, but most of the episodes look to have been sourced from tape and, while watchable, are far from pristeen evidencing no restoration work whatsover.  Still there's enough here to keep fans of classic TV Westerns happy.

I recommend this set with some reservations, primarily based on audio/visual quality.  Here are the shows on each disc (one episode per show):
