Amazing piece of artistic work, exactly what was expected from ELOY... Cheers & Peace",1356739200,,200,5.090909090909091
8421285,5,B004B0O3TO,"This 2 DVD package is an very good work about the most important artrock music export from Germany: Eloy. DVD 1 contains a history, with interviews with a lot of Eloy-bandmembers and other important people performed in German with English subtitle. Inbetween the interview-parts there is Eloy's music and graphics/photos illustrating the different times in the history of this band.
DVD 2 contains clips, videos and live appearances which are a big rarity for this band. The quality is not alway superb due to the age of the recordings, but are of value for everyone who is interested in this band.
The DVD has no region code but is only issued in the European PAL format, which could make problems to American DVD players - but every newer player should be able to handle it, as well as playstations etc.
Eloy appears live this summer in Germany and will produce a LIVE-DVD.",1302220800,,875,4.7631578947368425
8421286,5,B004B0O3TO,"I have been a fan since the 70's.  This release offers a great look into one of the finest progressive bands in the world through interviews and clips.  Disc 2 showcases videos and live performances over the past 40 years.  Please note that discs are 0 region.  Most newer DVD players will play these discs. Out of the 3 dvd player I have 2 have no problem.  Your computer should also be able to play them as they are region 0 and not 2.

Quality of the videos is excellent from the time they were shot.  The highlights to me were tracks taken from the 80's and 90's as well as the studio from 2010.  I understand a live dvd is being planned for the band and this with be very welcomed treat to fans of this incredible band.",1297987200,4,724,4.158273381294964
