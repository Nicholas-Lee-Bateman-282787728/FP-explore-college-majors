7996569,5,B0000ACNPU,"This is a really interesting and well-shot, visually-speaking,  period film describing the trials, tribulations and triumphs of William Tyndale, translator of the Holy Scriptures into the English tongue.  The movie shows Tyndale as one dedicated to spreading the message of the Bible and the people who supported him in his endeavour - often at the risk of their own lives. I have watched this film 4 times in various bible study groups and have purchased my own copy - I really think that it's worth the cost of the purchase price.  With this, I also recommend the movie - JOHN HUS - as an accompaning Reformation resource.",1058659200,13,624,4.813084112149533
