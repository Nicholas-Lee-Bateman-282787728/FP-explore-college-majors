5184231,4,B008UZCCBC,"They appear to be set on following the same pattern that Adventure Time did for its' DVD releases. Two compilation DVDs, then a season set (hopefully a set that includes both seasons one and two (like Shout! Factory's first Angry Beavers set), as season one could fit on a single disc). I'm sure that soon after the release of this compilation we'll get some sort of announcement concerning a more complete release.",1347148800,10,415,4.777777777777778
5184232,2,B008UZCCBC,"This release is titled, ""Best DVD in the world"", yet is lacking the episode ""Best VHS in the world""? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Not to mention that episode is one of the best. This show absolutely needs full season releases. Let people experience such great episodes as ""Grave Sights"" and The Halloween Special.",1346889600,,319,4.714285714285714

5184234,5,B008UZCCBC,I'd give it five. Easily. Creative. Surprising. Well worth the sit down. The characters are priceless. We all know these guys,1441584000,,125,5.0
5184235,5,B008UZCCBC,"The Regular show is a popular animated series shown on Cartoon Network. Kids really like this show with all its zany characters and interesting, offbeat storylines. Mordecai and Rigby are the main characters on the show, but there is so much more.  It's a smart show that adults will enjoy as much as their kids.  Highly recommend.  Regarding this DVD, our favorite episodes were Eggscellent and Skips vs. Technology.  One important note, this ""best of"" with only 16 episodes is not the best deal out there.  There are full season DVDs available with 40 episodes per year.  Much better deal.

5184238,5,B008UZCCBC,I love Regular Show! Mordecai and Rigby are always getting into the craziest situations and it's awesome seeing the character development as the seasons progress.,1428192000,,162,5.52
5184239,5,B008UZCCBC,"While I applaud the completionists who rallied for full seasons. This dvd IS actually some of the best on offer.
I was on the fence and this cheaper intro had me loving the show - enough to buy seasons 1 & 2 which I have watched season 1 of so far.
I consider this Best dvd appropriate for kids. Regular Shows ability for events to go anywhere and imagination to run riot is great. The music is excellent, characters are fun.

This Best of dvd is high on imagination and has minimal Loser insults, which don't make for enjoyable repeated viewing  more like brainwashing.
So buy this dvd, its really great! Showcasing some of the best on offer.

I felt compelled to write this as I feel let down by Season 1 after being spoiled by this Best of dvd.
I won't be showing some of Season 1's episodes to my kids because I don't want Loser to become ingrained in my kids vocabulary and be something they call others or themselves.

In this case, less is more.

Side note: I don't appreciate the idea of projecting labels (such as Loser) onto others as being something I consider beneficial in any way.
Unfortunately, it seems to be popular. But it is mindless and unhealthy. Share in others happiness, people! The Buddhist way. Rejoice in others happiness and you will be happy! There is so many opportunities to be happy when you can rejoice in others happiness.",1427673600,,1356,4.495934959349594

5184247,5,B008UZCCBC,"This show...how do I explain this show.
Its a feel good, goofy, and slightly stupid show about 2 friends who happen to be a blue jay and raccoon. They get a job at a park and have odd jobs to do around it every day. They are lazy and act like your average 20 year olds. Getting in constant trouble and finding themselves caught up in CRAZY situations every episode.
I love this show, the hidden adult jokes and down right stupid humor are right up my ally.
The only complaint I have, they didn't do a season, but just a bunch of random episodes on this DVD. Still 5 stars because the show itself makes up for it :)",1393372800,,614,4.125

5184263,5,B008UZCCBC,"Despite the title, The ""Regular Show: The Best Dvd In The World"" does contain some humorous episodes.  There is a special feature of employee profiles to go along with the sixteen episodes.  The one unique feature about this show is that the characters are depicted going about their daily activities and then are unexpectedly transported into a parallel universe.  The ""Cool Bikes"" episode was one of the multiple episodes where the characters were going about their daily routine of work and then suddenly pulled into another dimension to explain their actions.  ""The Regular Show: The Best Dvd  In The World"" is great for those who like comedic cartoons.",1362096000,,657,5.046296296296297

5184271,1,B008UZCCBC,"For a retro-style cartoon about a lazy bird, I was not expecting much from it. It was sad when it failed my already low expectations. The animation is poor and rather flat. Not much action, not much detail, not much of anything. Then the plotline. It withstood a whole 5 minutes before I turned the machine off. The dumb bird wants to design a webpage for a girl he likes but can't because some blobs creature called it first. Not very exciting. I was bored and annoyed by the crude jokes so much that I nearly threw up, and this was during the opening of the first episode. I guess if you enjoy lazy animation and writing, this should be at the top of your list.",1358553600,,663,4.26984126984127

5184284,2,B008UZCCBC,"How can something called ""The Best DVD In The World"" NOT include the episode ""The Best VHS In The World""?

I'll admit it - I'm happy to buy these mixed DVD sets if that helps Cartoon Network realize there IS a market for season sets of this show as well as Adventure Time, but these DVDs really aren't much to write home about.  Even the extra features on this one aren't great - they are very similar to the content on cartoonnetwork.com.  But honestly, I prefer to buy the season passes on iTunes.  They are close in cost and you get the full season.",1352851200,,552,4.278846153846154
5184285,5,B008UZCCBC,"I went ahead and bought a copy of ""The Best the DVD in the World"" on it's official release date, November 6th 2012. Ok, its great that their referring to one of the best episodes ""The Best VHS in the World"" which isn't even on the DVD. not cool man. In my opinion, they should have also offered the complete set available on a gold plastic VHS tape to get a real kick out of this show. Some of us still have a VCR sitting around. But of course that would cost a fortune and not many people would get it making it (perhaps) a collectors item. Besides the point. Go ahead and get the DVD, it's a jolly good show! We need to support the show to keep the series rolling on.",1352419200,,669,4.037593984962406
5184286,3,B008UZCCBC,"Get ready to go ""OOOOHHHHHH!"" because it's time for the new ""Regular Show"" DVD featuring 16 episodes from the Emmy-nominated Cartoon Network series such as ""The Best Burger in the World"" (where our two leads Mordecai and Rigby try to get a taste of a burger with Himalayan ketchup), ""Trash Boat"" (where Rigby tries to go by a strange new name), ""Butt Dial"" (where Mordecai leaves an accidental message on his girlfriend Margaret's phone), and ""Eggcellent"" (where the guys try to win a hat by eating an enormous omelet).

Special feature on this DVD is called ""Employee Profiles"" which it's more of a character bio feature like on the ""Adventure Time"" and ""Amazing World of Gumball"" releases.

It may say that it's ""The Best DVD in the World (At This Moment in Time)"", I can think of better DVDs than that, however. You'd probably think a better DVD release would be a complete season set for ""Regular Show"" and who knows ? It could be sometime soon. But for now, look for all new episodes on Cartoon Network.",1352332800,,1008,4.657303370786517
5184287,5,B008UZCCBC,"Mordecai & Rigby a.k.a. TrashBoat a.k.a. Rigbone  are COOLEST anthropomorphic slackers in the PARK! And You know I appreciate THAT!

The first DvD was just released with a random selection of 12 eps but this New DvD includes a whopping 16  11 minute eps: Slam Dunk, Cool Bikes, the best burger in the world, more smarter, rap it up weekend at Benson's,  camping can be cool, trash boat, butt dial, think positive video being wizards, skips vs technology, eggscellent, muscle mentor, Fists of Justice, trucker Hall of Fame.",1352160000,,794,4.866666666666666
5184288,4,B008UZCCBC,"Since ""Regular Show: The Slack Pack"" has been released, the animated television series has gone on to win its first Emmy, debuted its first half hour special, and introduced a new character named Thomas, an intern at the park, in its 4th (and currently ongoing) season. While it was glorious that ""Regular Show"" finally had its first DVD release under its belt, the release was not without its issues. ""Regular Show: The Best DVD in the World (At This Moment in Time)"" is at least a step in the right direction.

One of the biggest questions every fan of the show had who picked up ""The Slack Pack"" was what was going on with the episode listing? The first season is only 12 episodes, which is how many episodes are on ""The Slack Pack,"" but the DVD is a mixture of episodes from seasons one and two. ""The Best DVD in the World"" is just 16 episodes from season 3. The down side is that while great episodes such as ""More Smarter,"" ""Trash Boat,"" and ""Eggscellent"" are included on the disc, so many are left unreleased from not only previous seasons but also season 3. The biggest crime is leaving off the season 3 episode ""The Best VHS in the World,"" which should have been a must next to ""The Best Burger in the World."" But epic episodes like ""Caffeinated Concert Tickets,"" ""Free Cake,"" and ""Rigby's Body,"" from season 1, ""High Score,"" ""But I Have a Receipt,"" and ""Skunked"" from season 2, and ""Stick Hockey"" and ""Fortune Cookie"" from season 3 all still remain on the shelf.

The DVD art from ""The Slack Pack"" was hideous, but the artwork on ""The Best DVD in the World"" at least looks like it was pulled directly from the show. While all of the specs on ""The Best DVD in the World"" are exactly the same as they were on ""The Slack Pack,"" the video transfer looks better on ""The Best DVD in the World."" Maybe it's because of the episodes chosen and the high contrast of color from episode to episode, but the show looks great this time around. Those glitches that plagued certain episodes on ""The Slack Pack"" are thankfully nonexistent.

The Rah-Ha Ringtone special feature on ""The Slack Pack"" was at least entertaining despite being incredibly short. All you have this time around are some ""Employee Profiles."" It's all pretty basic stuff surrounding all of the main characters. The most interesting bit of information lies in Benson's profile where it lists him as a former drummer for rock icon Hair to the Throne. That wasn't revealed until the episode ""150-Piece Kit"" from season 4, so this DVD is obviously from The Night Owl's collection in the futuristic year of 4224.

It's still a travesty that a soundtrack featuring either completely original music or the actual copyrighted music used in the show has not been released. Actual songs used in this DVD alone include Filter's ""Hey Man, Nice Shot,"" Mountain's ""Mississippi Queen,"" The Beach Boys ""I Get Around,"" Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out For a Hero,"" and Lakme's ""The Flower Duet."" The original music is just as 80's inspired as the show is and is usually very synth heavy and utilized during montages. Movie, TV, and video game references include ""Rushmore,"" ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" ""The Terminator,"" ""Judge Dredd,"" ""Back to the Future,"" ""Dragonball Z,"" ""Tron,"" ""Mortal Kombat,"" the Power Glove, and ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade.""

""Regular Show: The Best DVD in the World (At This Moment in Time)"" is a bit of an upgrade from ""Regular Show: The Slack Pack"" and if it's following the same release schedule as ""Adventure Time,"" then a full season release (that hopefully combines seasons 1 and 2) is right around the corner. The artwork on the DVD alone is a huge improvement and the show looks great for a standard DVD release, but its content leaves you wanting much more. But until a full season of ""Regular Show"" sees the light of day, this and ""The Slack Pack"" are all fans have to enjoy in the meantime.

So slap on your mentoring harness and Maximum Glove, never forget the power of poetry, go camping in the sunshiiiiiine, and be sure to take the time to taste the Himalayas because ""Regular Show: The Best DVD in the World (At This Moment in Time)"" is just under three hours of more smarter entertainment. Tsk tsk! And don't get b-b-b-busted misusing a hoooooooose while changing your name to two completely random words.",1352073600,3,4293,4.679470198675497
