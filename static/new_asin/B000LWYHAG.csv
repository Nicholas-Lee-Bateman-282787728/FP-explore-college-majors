Just shows how far we have come when it involves the second amendment and gun control. Still the same argument today that we had forty years ago.",1394064000,2,307,4.4035087719298245
8164755,5,B000LWYHAG,"A typical hunting weekend with the boys suddenly goes very bad. Entirely possible and plausible at that time...post Viet Nam, Korea...
The middle of the movie needs to be as it is....developmental and telling....watch closely for ""the spy"". Interesting for vets will be the mishmash of WWII jungle camo...Korean war camo and Viet Nam tiger stripes....excellent attention to detail in what a bunch of guys from different war eras would assemble. Equally interesting is the different and varied weaponry....from standard US issue to MAC 10's and S&W model 76 smgs... The other side as well...won't spoil it by saying why. The climax is an ""uh oh...oh s***!"" moment.
Worth the watch, especially at deer camp.",1383696000,,705,5.139130434782609
8164756,3,B000LWYHAG,"This film was well hyped when released, with trailers and ads talking about the power and efficiency of the Ingram sub-machine gun; what happens when hunting trips go wrong; and revenge. The movie only lived up to the hype in the first, and last scenes, but the concept is still sound.

The story starts out with a great set-up when a group of ex-military friends (very good actors - Cliff Robertson, Ernest Borgnine, Henry Silva) venture out hunting in the Canadian wilderness. The story shifts when they encounter a ""rival"" group of hunters in the distance. After an accident of sorts, both sides retreat. When no one reports the accident from the other side, ex-military major Cliff Robertson becomes convinced the rival hunters are plotting against them. Great ethical dilemma and set-up so far.

Here is where the film bogs down, way bogs down. It's like they had about ten minutes of script, and spread it out over the next hour giving us unnecessary details on character development and families, and wordy dialog that didn't properly explore the ethics of the hunters' situation and quandary. By the time the climax approaches you're almost asleep wondering what the heck too so long. However, when the final riveting scenes finally do arrive, they command absolute attention and will not leave you disappointed.

If you get a chance to see this movie, pay close attention to the beginning, don't worry about popcorn or potty breaks during the long middle, and wake up for the ending.

As of October of 2007, this film hasn't been released on DVD, and only exists on old VHS.",1191715200,8,1583,4.851851851851852
