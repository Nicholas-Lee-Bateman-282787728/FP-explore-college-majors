5253861,5,B00936A2J6,I never thought I would be able to find this old movie so when I saw it here at Amazon I had to grab it.  The story line is excellent the acting is done very professionally and the plot is very believable and keeps u at the edge of your seat. I have watched this movie over and over again since I got it! If you love Bogart and love old movies then this is the movie for you from his early work!,1411430400,,395,3.7590361445783134
5253862,5,B00936A2J6,Great acting; unpredictable and dramatic.  A favorite of mine!,1410566400,,62,5.888888888888889
5253863,5,B00936A2J6,"Great movie, but I am a little biased when it comes to Bogie films. He,  Edward G. Robinson, and James Cagney were all classics like White Heat everyone should see that enjoy films of this era. Not just the actors but the cars of the time period were also classic.  Since retirement, I really enjoy reliving the screen.",1410220800,2,319,4.482758620689655
5253864,1,B00936A2J6,"The DVD is sratched, the disc has been dubed & I spent $30 for this rubbish, I'm sending my review as I'm a good customer, but not a very happy one",1406073600,,147,3.774193548387097
5253865,2,B00936A2J6,"""King of the Underworld"" is a 1939 crime data based on an original screenplay by famed crime writer W. R. Burnett (""Little Caesar"", ""Beast of the City"", ""High Sierra"", ""This Gun for Hire"", ""Asphalt Jungle"", ""Scarface""). The plot borrows heavily from Warner Brothers ""Dr. Socrates"" (1935) with Paul Muni as well as ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936) with Humphrey Bogart.

In a complicated plot, a mob surgeon is killed and his innocent wife (Kay Francis) under suspicion gets involved with the mob boss (Humphrey Bogart), a man who fancies himself a modern day Napolean.

Humphrey Bogart (1899-1957) usually played second fiddle to Edward G. Robinson (""Kid Galahad"", ""Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"") and James Cagney (""The Roaring Twenties"", ""The Oklahoma Kid"", ""Angels with Dirty Faces""), but here he gets his first starring role, even though it is a B film. Only two years later, in 1941 he starred in ""High Sierra"" and ""The Maltese Falcon"" and he became a big name star, eventually surpassing all other Warner stars in 1943 on the tail of his performance in ""Casablanca"".  Bogart's performance in this one is undistinguished, to say the most

Kay Francis (1905-68) plays the wife. Francis was the #1 Warner's female star in the mid 30s, before Bette Davis took over. She won no awards but her films like ""Trouble in Paradise"" (1932), ""One Way Passage"" (1932), ""I Found Stella Parrish"" (1935) and ""Confession"" (1937) were box office hits. But by the end of the decade, Francis was listed as ""box office poison"" (along with Mae West, Katherine Hepburn, and Marlene Dietrich) and her career declined.

The film was directed by Lewis Seiler (1890-1964). He worked with Tom Mix in the silent era and subsequently directed nearly 100 films including ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) and ""Guadalcanal Diary"" (1943).

The film is a clear throw back to the mid 30s but coming in 1939 it is also an embarrassment. 1939 was one of the finest years in film history -  ""Gone with the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Ninotchka"",  ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". "" ""Stagecoach"", ""Dark Victory"", ""Of Mice and Men"", ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"", ""Beau Geste"", ""Destry Rides Again"", ""Gunga Din"", ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", ""Elizabeth and Essex"", and ""The Roaring Twenties"".

Bottom line - a throwback to the gangster films of the early 30s.",1367107200,2,2326,5.005181347150259
5253866,5,B00936A2J6,Great addition to my Humphrey Bogart collection. Vendor was quick in fullfilling this order. Will definately use them again. Thanks,1361404800,,131,5.6
5253867,4,B00936A2J6,"I see while watching this film it was rereleased which means it achieved some success. Which is surprising since it is a slimmed down film, 69 m, about a gangster rising to the top of his profession, and rubbin gout a doctor..although we're never told the full story. Kay Francis who was a sophisticated star of sorts, but her films for whatever reason seemed to lose their popularity. She seemed happy to make this film with her costar..and then..he became star as the film was rewritten while being made..and her role seemed slighted, and the whole thing seems kind of strange? Unless the studio did that purposely bent on dropping her since she was no longer a hot commodity and her costar was..and actually watching the film the action is centered on him and he becomes a king of sort..a political reference..napoleon facing his waterloo..the big gang battle..napoleon being marooned to ST Helen an empire turning into an island..like alduous huxley's Brave New World..writing a sequel of sorts Island..a Tempest of sorts..but here we have the bogart character..and these references are pulled from the script..and as Aristotle sais we are all ""political animals"" everything is converted into politics..all thiese rather intelligent references in a very exciting dialogue which the actor Bogart making up this gangland talk on the go..and he often helped out on the scripts being an avid reader. That was the case in this film and his name was put before the title for the first time. An exciting film with action, and you may wonder why FRancis would be involved in such a film..it was changed while being made..and she could have walked off..being slighted..and lost a signigiciant amount of money..although she doesnt seem all that happy..but an interesting film king's..losing a gang empire..and the double take on the world of politics. After High Sierra was made gangster movies changed, we had film noir, and they became complex and sophisticated, darkly layered probably the best of old hollywood and had a prestigious worldwide reputation, but these 30's films are authentic with real street talk, authentic real life gangster portrayals and talk..and the director as in this case stood aside..thats how jack ran his studio and cared for his female stars.",1361145600,,2268,5.083109919571045

5253874,3,B00936A2J6,Warner Brothers canned gangster formula.  The story wasted Humphrey Bogart's and Kay Francis's talents.  Still fun to watch them.,1417910400,,129,5.7368421052631575
5253875,5,B00936A2J6,"I am a big Kay Francis fan! This movie was made late in her career, but it is still a good role for Kay.
She plays a doctor to Bogarts gangster.
This movie is not one where Kay wears fancy clothes, she's pretty down to earth. But the acting is pure Kay!
So if you are a fan, this is a good buy, and if you're not, buy it anyway, you won't be disappointed, lol.",1417737600,,360,3.8133333333333335

(It's been shutdown by the Feds. Bogart was good at doing the gangster bit & I wonder how audiences saw him in the 1930's before he went on to greater acclaim from 1941 onwards. Bogart is great even in his rare obscure films.",1413590400,,418,4.148148148148148

8535044,4,B00936A2J6,Bogart is always great and Kay Francis was even more fun as a mature actress than she was in her heyday.  Nice support by James Stephenson as well.,1475625600,,147,4.25

8535048,3,B00936A2J6,"Bogart might have gotten top billing, but Kay Francis is the lead in this film and her character, despite her haughty style, is the the emancipated professional woman of strong character and yet common sense, and shows what direction Hollywood might have gone in terms of female characterizations had the war not intervened and men had not jumped to the heroic forefront.  I would not call this a bogie film at all.
  The film gets three stars because it's production values are low, support cast hardly supports, and it is not a long film at all which is not atypical of the time, but nonetheless was not up to 1939 standards.",1441411200,,627,4.63063063063063
