Today, Alaskan natives still struggle for recognition of their historical lands and were not included in the reservation bill introduced in the 19th century. Alaska has a rich history of violence and social discrimination towards natives and this documentary does a pretty great job of reviewing that past. Additionally, the video focuses on the Alaskan Native Brotherhood that was instrumental in helping press for civil rights in the early 20th century. This video parallel's other documentaries on the rights of African-Americans, though, it seems Alaskan natives and all native Americans as well as their history is neglected to this very day. This is a great video to inform yourself to the impact of American culture and the expansion of the country on the aboriginal's of this land. Most important, is the anti-discrimination bill introduced in 1945 preceding those in the south by a number of years.",1397606400,,1105,5.17877094972067
