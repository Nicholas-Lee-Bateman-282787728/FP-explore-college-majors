8204890,4,B000SAAT76,"Americans whose familiarity with Marion Cotillard's career (some 40 movies since she was 16) had extended only to BIG FISH, A GOOD YEAR, LOVE ME IF YOU DARE, and the French TAXI 1,2 and 3 may have been poleaxed by her reach, intensity and passion in LA VIE EN ROSE.  In fact, this actress has had those qualities all along.  True, she did rise to national (French) prominence with the TAXIs, in which she is hilarious, but her work in the also-available A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, FURIA, and PRETTY THINGS is revealing of her courage in edgier, gritty and more dramatic roles. She plays both twins -- Lucie and Marie -- who are quite different in personality and attitudes.  I don't think we're meant to like PRETTY THINGS, but her performance is stunning, and a revelation of her decision to change her image in the French media from ""commedienne"" to ""actress.""  It's her work here, and this film's placement in helping those interested to understand the blossoming of her career, which are important, rather than the content, much of which is inarguably ""over the top."" This is a major talent, one which is just now beginning to show its full potential.  And, as it turns out, the girl really CAN sing.",1209513600,14,1201,4.672985781990521
