8130084,3,B000GAKIS8,"This movie has a lot of positive influence about safety, using helmets, etc.  The majority of the video is very positive.  It portrays ""good guys"" with good character traits and ""bad guys"" with bad attitudes -- and children are supposed to deduce which attitudes to emulate.  Perhaps for most children this may not be an issue.  I happen to have two very impressionable boys, and listening to the ""bad guys"" saying, ""Safety rules are for losers!"" is unhelpful for us (even though the bad guys get hurt because of their choices).  Despite the way the rules of safety are promoted, I had to pass this video on to someone else.",1377820800,,624,4.636363636363637
