6899113,5,B00R5ASNFC,"Valley Uprising is to big wall climbing what Stacy Peralta's Riding Giants was to big wave surfing.  Both films put the histories of their respective subjects into cultural context and emphasize the subversive and fearless spirit that drove the pioneers of modern climbing/surfing and those who followed their lead.  And both movies manage to present their material in ways that appeal to mainstream audiences as well as those inside the sports. There's no talk of grading systems in Valley Uprising and viewers are given just enough technical information about climbing to appreciate the accomplishments of the remarkable men and women who are the film's focus.

Valley Uprising was never widely released, appearing only in locally hosted screenings at colleges, climbing gyms etc.  It's a shame that few outside of the climbing/outdoor adventure sub-culture know of the film since its obvious the filmmakers took great care to appeal to a wider audience.

The Blu-Ray version I purchased includes extra climbing and interview footage and a ""climbing brush"" which I plan to use to clean the chain on my bike.",1422144000,2,1109,5.207865168539326
