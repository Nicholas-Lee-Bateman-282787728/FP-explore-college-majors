8581575,1,B00CGDSGTG,"I am an ELL (ESL) teachers who was looking for support materials to use with my students.  This DVD is mis-titled.  These are not songs, they're chants.  The performer SHOUTS the chants throughout the entire DVD.  The backing music is a loud techno selection.  This is how a typical ""song"" goes.  ""A is a vowel, a letter in the alphabet"" repeated 4 times, the sound of short ""a"" repeated 32 times - yes, 32! - while an ""a"" is shown on the screen the whole time, then a chant with 4 words having that sound and a picture of each word (cat, hat, nap, lap), then the whole process repeated for long ""a"". Multiply this by 26 letters.  During each lengthy ""song"", only four words with that sound (eight for vowels) are presented.

This is not a helpful teaching supplement or one that provides pleasant listening.  I'm sorry I wasted my money.",1423440000,,838,4.4605263157894735
