4504328,5,B004Z1HYBS,"Ava Duvernay's I Will Follow is a breath of fresh air in a stale period of African-American cinema. I Will Follow is a beautifully crafted film that features multidimensional characters, beautiful cinematography and a thought-provoking plot. I haven't seen a Black film made with this level of quality in over a decade. This is one of the best films of 2011.

Salli Richardson-Whitfield gives one of her finest performances as Maye, the niece of Amanda, a background drummer for some of the most popular musicians of the70's and 80's. After taking a year off to care for her dying aunt, she has one day to pack up all the belongings in the home she shared with her and we watch as twelve strangers help her pack her belongings into a truck and help her move forward with her life.

I Will Follow is a great movie. It's rare that we get to see these slices of African-American life presented onscreen, a film where we see African-Americans as multidimensional people, expressing themselves as human beings, not like caricatures and stereotypes. This is the kind of story about Black life we hear about all the time, but it's rarely ever shown onscreen in the media. It's very rare that Black actors are given material of this quality and an opportunity to perform playing multidimensional characters like this in today's media. This is the kind of African-American film I want to see made, and if I made films this would be the kind of film I would make.
The screenwriting on this film is top notch. Many say Duvernay's story is slow, but I have no problem with the pacing of this movie. The storyline is very subtle and nuanced showing us those little things in life so many of us take for granted. It's the kind of story that can easily go over people's heads if they're not paying attention.

I've always enjoyed Salli Richardson Whitfield's work. But she takes her craft to another level with her powerful performance in I Will Follow. Richardson effortlessly carries the film from fade in to fade out in her portrayal of Maye, a woman who has to hold it together in the face of so much. It's the little things in Richardson's performance that are great to watch in I Will Follow, the looks on her face, the way she carries herself with a quiet dignity, the way she conveys kindness and compassion as she handles a stressful situation. Richardson has great chemistry with every actor onscreen and makes us feel a connection to all the people who she interacts with throughout the day.

The supporting cast is also very strong. Beverly Todd gives a dignified and elegant performance as Amanda, a woman who wants to end her life on her own terms. Michole Briana White is very strong as Fran, the Daughter who had a strained relationship with her mother, but is angry about the close relationship Amanda had with Maye. You feel her jealousy and anger at Maye throughout her time onscreen. When she and Richardson are on screen there's intensity and tension. Dijon Halton is solid in his role as Raven, a good kid who sticks around to help Maye. I love the conversation he has with Maye about Nas and Jay-z; it's the kind of conversation people have in real life. Omari Hardwick is solid as a potential love interest for Maye and Blair Underwood gives one of his strongest performances in a small role as Maye's former lover. There are so many great performances here, like the two Goodwill guys who add some humor and the Cancer Survivor who takes down the satellite dish adds some warmth and humanity. I wish I could mention everyone, because the entire cast does an amazing job of supporting this film.

I really appreciate this film and what it represents historically for Black Cinema. I Will Follow was independently financed and independently produced. More importantly, it was the first Black film independently distributed to theaters by a black distributor. Made for just $50,000 and shot in just six days I Will Follow looks like a film that cost over $40 million minimum. The cinematography on this film is beautiful with serene shots and powerful visuals that tell a strong story the viewer will never forget. Duvernay tells a great story with her camera, and her first film has me eager to see more of her work.

I Will Follow is a Shawn James Five Star Essential Video. Pick this up today!",1315612800,24,4303,4.677675033025099
4504329,2,B004Z1HYBS,"I just received my copy of ""I Will Follow"" and watched the 90 minute film with baited breadth, hoping that this would be a part of my ""Favorite Titles"" collection.  Unfortunately, I'm sorry to report that ""I Will Follow"" has misled this viewer down a confusing winding road.  The marketing of the movie led this viewer to believe that the story was a love story, the love of a niece for her terminal aunt, and the love of a woman for her knight in shining armor.  If the story was in fact going to be more about self-love and self healing, then perhaps the writer/director should have changed the visual advertisement of the cover and the trailers leading up to the actual story with a more realistic depiction of the movie.  Although there are things that I did enjoy about the film (e.g., cinematography, Salli Richardson-Whitfield's acting abilities, and the soundtrack), the movie left me wanting much more from this writer.  The attempt to tell the story through flashbacks and subtle conversations between the characters was a difficult task and was hard to invest my emotions into their experiences. The emotional outburts/arguments between the cousins weren't believable.  The way the relationship played or didn't even take off between Maye and Troy was also unbelievable.  In fact, the only real moments of authenticity between them was the flirtation on the swings, and Maye's frustration with not getting what she wants from Troy. I support the writer's efforts with my purchase of the film and I don't feel disappointed for doing so.  But I do wish, if the writer felt that the story could stand completely alone on its own merits that she would have supported that belief with more realistic advertisement.  The fact that she chose to sell her story based on the attraction between Maye and Troy and not deliver, was disappointing and very misleading.  Try again, better luck next time.",1314835200,6,1900,4.890965732087228
4504330,5,B004Z1HYBS,"With I Will Follow, DuVernay has managed to do something rarely achieved in American cinema: present black folk--and black gay folk for that matter--as human beings capable of the same joys and sorrows, traversing the same hills and valleys, as the rest of the world.

Outside of their common tropes, devoid of demeaning pathology and dehumanizing racial and sexual gazes, DuVernay is free to display these characters with an inward gaze, which only serves to magnify their humanity. They have lives that seem informed by events that occur before and after the film. In other words, they are three dimensional: not ""black people"" or ""gay people,"" but just people.

All of this is recorded with a lens so precise and a light so interested in finding the beauty in every instant, that even the moments of sorrow are moonglow. And one must not forget the cinematography: lovely trees, breathtaking sunsets, winding roads, and the elegance of privacy. One can only hope that the Academy and the NAACP are watching, too.

I Will Follow is a sublime, hip, inspired, affirming, empowering film that evinces DuVernay's incredible intellect. If this is the kind of art we can expect from this writer/director in the future, then, perhaps, we should follow her wherever she decides to take us.",1311638400,39,1283,4.985981308411215
4504331,3,B004Z1HYBS,"In ""I Will Follow,"" successful makeup artist Maye Fisher (nicely played by Salli Richardson-Whitfield) is grieving the loss of her dear aunt Amanda as she packs to move out of the home they shared for the past year. The pending move incites conversation, confrontation, and closure between Maye and a handful of loved ones.

""I Will Follow"" is a lovely film. Simple. Serene. Quiet yet aptly punctuated with electric scenes like the emotional confrontation between Maye and her cousin (and Amanda's daughter) Fran (powerfully rendered by Michole White) and the deliciously tense exchange between Maye and Troy (played by Omari Hardwick - uh. yum), a gentleman friend who'd been on standby for a year. (So as not to give too much away, I'm gonna leave it at that.) The film's location - a charming home in Topanga Canyon, California - and soothing soundtrack provide the perfect backdrop and ambience.",1306454400,48,899,5.033557046979865

The movie tends to be slow, but that is probably the way the director was going with this film, since the theme is sombre.

4504361,5,B004Z1HYBS,"One scene always comes to mind with this movie.  Richardson-Whitfield's character has a discussion with the mother of a teen.  I think that they are sisters.  Either way, I could feel the hurt inside of them.  It was a difficult time for both of them already but the feelings that came from the child complicated things even more.

The actions in this film are subtle pretty much all around.  No car chases or jumping off of buildings.  No outright hatred.  It's a love story that will make you analyze your family relationships.  You will probably see someone that resembles your family member in this film.",1413504000,2,608,4.714285714285714

It would have been nice to see more interaction between the two stars on the cover, to get a better understanding of the dynamics of their relationship, as well as her husband who chose not to care very much. It did however reveal how different we see terminal illness and death. It was also sad to see how the daughter treated the niece who gave up her life for a year to take care of her cousins mother. And true to form that's a reality in many families. The actors were superb in their acting and it was a nice movie to watch, but not to keep in my library.",1407196800,,616,4.099173553719008

4504376,5,B004Z1HYBS,"I downloaded this to watch Ava DuVernay's writing and direction. Solid on both points. After watching it I did a little more research on DuVernay and found a review of this film by Roger Ebert saying it was the most sensitive film about loss he had ever seen. I agree. It never falls into pathos yet pulls the heart apart one string at a time, then rebuilds it back with the mortar of love. The family dynamics are beautifully written, directed, and acted from start to end credits. It's been several months since I viewed this film, yet it's still vivid in my mind, and that's saying something for a person dealing with sensory overload and constantly discarding everything that isn't wowza.

DuVernay has seen been signed to direct major films with big studios. That is no surprise. Stunning work.",1386806400,2,799,4.707142857142857

4504383,5,B004Z1HYBS,"Maybe you are not use to viewing Black Americans in this sort of movie. Perhaps, you may never remember knowing or seeing a movie of this genre (at least in this century). But this is an amazingly quiet and beautiful movie that speaks of the human cross-roads that all of us will go through at some point in our lives. It quietly touches on the choices that we make in the face of adversity and the inevitability of death of someone that we love. It speaks quietly about how the human spirit can torture us when we have not been honest with ourselves, or are too late to make the change/take the chance that we could have/should have before losing someone forever. It speaks to the heartbreak of children to their parents, young people to their elders. It speaks to how sometimes, when death comes how badly we can behave. It speaks to how we can get sidetracked from who and what is really important in the grand scheme of things; and what the consequences of that action, that choice can be. It is a strong powerful movie that needs no apology for its story. It does not judge. The soundtrack is so very moving, soothing, melodically (is that even a word?)harmonious , and adds a perfect back-drop to the movie without over powering it; or intefering with what this movie expresses. The soundtrack enhances this movie exponentially!
At this price point, it should be added to your dvd collection; and viewed with those that you love, that you may love, that you call friend, that you call family. Enjoy!",1361664000,7,1505,4.5777777777777775

No explicit sex scenes. No bullets or F-bombs flying all over the place. No fist fights or killing. No car crashes. No explosions. This movie was interesting, enlightening, touching... calm.

The main thing that came to mind as I watched: It's best to have a will, so family members don't argue over who gets what. But then again, they just might argue anyway.

The guys from Goodwill were funny.
The flashbacks helped me to understand the kind of relationship Maye had with her Aunt and to see the kind of woman Amanda was. (I liked those best)
Maye's exchanges with Amanda's daughter, Fran (Michole Brianna White)weren't really intense, but did add a bit of drama.

I Will Follow is about dealing with grief. It's about being comforted in time of sorrow. It's about selflessness and selfishness. It's about misunderstandings and family discord. It's about the expectations we have of others. It's about finding the strength to move on. It is a film worth watching.",1335225600,,1190,4.847290640394089

I think the tagline that says this movie ""chronicles a day in the life of a woman at a crossroads, and the twelve people who help her move forward into a brave, new world"" really says it all.

It's filled with so many beautiful minute moments & interactions that help you remember love in so many different ways. Loved it.",1327795200,4,520,4.350515463917525

4504397,2,B004Z1HYBS,I REALLY HAD A HARD TIME FOLLOWING THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS SO SLOW AND BORING. THE MAIN CHARACTER'S AUNT HAD DIED AND THEY HAD BEEN REALLY CLOSE. SO THE MOVIE IS BASICALLY ABOUT HER THINKING ABOUT OLD DAYS AS SHE CLEANED OUT HER AUNTS HOUSE. IN THE MIDST OF HER PACKING UP THINGS HER AUNTS DAUGHTER COMES THROUGH AND SPEAKS HER MIND ABOUT HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE MAIN CHARACTER'S EX BOYFRIEND SHOWS UP ALSO. I WOULD SAVE MY MONEY...THAT IS TEN THAT COULD GO ON GAS...,1323475200,3,491,4.406593406593407

4504399,2,B004Z1HYBS,"This is my first review. I have bought several hundred movies from Amazon, but this is the first time I was compelled to write a review. I was compelled because I spent $15 on something that was falsely advertised, and not worth my money. Let me say this up front, I love the actors in this movie, but I feel they were in the wrong movie at the wrong time.

People watch movies for different reasons, I watch them because they are of a certain genre (sci-fi, action, erotica ,etc.) or because of the actors. I got this one because of Omari and Salli. Looking at the DVD cover, I'm thinking this is going to be a romance (look, I know what I like and don't like when it comes to movies). This cover lead me to think there was going to be some romance going on between the two of them....there was not!

Now I can understand the folks who reviewed this movie, and they raved about how good it was... I can empathize because I have a friend who is battling cancer, and had a cousin die from it, but the movie was boring.

Salli spent the whole day (87 minutes in our time) in her aunts house, packing it up. THIS IS THE ONLY LOCATION FOR THE WHOLE MOVIE. If you are a Blair Underwood fan, he spent all of 5 minutes on the screen (none of them with Salli); Omari spent about 10 minutes on the screen, and of those, he spent about 10 seconds kissing Salli. So, to say the least, there was no sex scene in the movie. Salli wears baggy clothes throughout the movie, so if you like her because of her physical features, you can forget it.

Amazon says this movie is unrated....well, if it was rated it would be rated G, because nothing is going on in the movie......no love scene, no nudity....nada. I gave it two stars.....one for Salli and one for Omari. Don't be mislead by the DVD cover!",1317081600,6,1783,4.235294117647059

4504401,3,B004Z1HYBS,Recommended highly. Seems to drag at first but then the relationships with the different characters flesh out. The kind of movie that stays with you.,1316044800,4,149,5.0

8449203,4,B004Z1HYBS,"This was a good clean movie.  It's weird to say this, but this movie was good and boring at the same time.
It should have gone deeper into the characters of Michole White's character dealing with her mother, Omari Hardwick's character, Blair Underwood's character, & Salli Richardson-Whitfield's character about the clarity of her career.
I think that these elements would have eliminated the boredom.
Other than that...I would have given 5 stars.",1514073600,,447,5.208333333333333
