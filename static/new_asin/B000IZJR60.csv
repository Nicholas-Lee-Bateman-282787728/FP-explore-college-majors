One question you will be asking yourself if you decide to go for this one.
I felt an obligation to watch it as I adore the main lead for his fine looks and underrated acting skills.
Other than that, literally everything about this piece of work falls flat on the ground.
It's like a torture that you can not undo.",1458864000,,329,4.238095238095238
8147913,2,B000IZJR60,"There's one dance number in here that looks like it was choreographed by Salvador Dali on a $10 budget... and I can watch it over and over... but the rest of the movie is terrible. Maybe it's poor subtitling, but the jokes are thin and the plot is dull. I have a huge affinity for Bollywood and I admit my standards are pretty forgiving, but this one is really weak.

It's such a shame because that one dance scene is so awesome.",1235174400,,429,4.2317073170731705
