7827629,1,6302479118,"Pulp is one of my favorite bands, was greatly looking forward to watching this. Unfortunately, this won't play on my US player, and my chromebook doesn't have a dvd drive. Even if it did, I could just youtube the videos, was looking forward to watching it on my flatscreen. What a shame",1393977600,,286,4.519230769230769
7827630,4,6302479118,"I learned from my purchase of this dvd that my current dvd player doesn't have the PAL-to-NTSC converting feature that my previous one did, something which had not occurred to me at the time of purchase.  It will play on a computer's dvd drive, but if not being able to watch it on your actual television is a dealbreaker, check your dvd player's capabilities first and save yourself some trouble.  Aside from that, this is a pretty great video retrospective.",1354579200,,459,4.725

7827633,1,6302479118,"I love Pulp and was very excited to receive my DVD. However, it cannot be played by my US DVD player, in spite of the fact that the details on this item specifically state this DVD is for US and Canada only. I can play on my laptop but it's not why I purchased it. I would rather watch on my beautiful flatscreen with stereo sound. Bad form, Amazon.",1273795200,8,349,4.072463768115942

But to have the VHS, & be able to see him perform, is wonderful. He was the greatest singer of all time. I shall be listeng to his music till the day I can hear no more.
