7929088,1,B000050NRZ,"Start with the laughably bad dialogue and go from there.  This film needs the MST3K treatment.  There are some mostly silicone-enhanced women to ogle, but the story is so badly written and confusing that when the main characters' lawyer-friend explains to them what's going on about 3/4s through the film, it feels like he is explaining what's going on to the audience as well.",1157068800,,377,4.875
7929089,5,B000050NRZ,If your a fan of Quentin Tarantino then you will love this movie. Dispite a few flaws one being the music the acting and directing were remarkable. I'd defently recomend this flick for any fan especialy the hardcore Quentin Tarantino fans out there.,1043452800,,249,4.813953488372093
