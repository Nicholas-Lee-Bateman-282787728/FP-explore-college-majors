2400772,5,B000B5XOUC,"Simply cannot get eNOUGH of this series.  Ever!!!

Anyone know when season eight's coming out?

Frasier Fanatic",1134259200,,111,5.411764705882353
2400773,5,B000B5XOUC,"I would like to go on record as giving Paramount a BIG ""THANK YOU"" for making the previews included on Disc one of this set an option to choose instead of having them automatically play as was the case with Season 6. When I called Paramount to complain I was told that they were receiving many calls regarding this and I am grateful that it was decided to make a change with Season 7. THANKS AGAIN Paramount!",1132531200,3,408,4.311688311688312
2400774,4,B000B5XOUC,"Its interesting to me how well these episodes are holding up. The Donny, Mel, and Regan characters were my least favorite. Out of the entire series, this season was probably the lowest point to me. Yet, even at its lowest point, the Frasier series still delivers! During this time in its run, I quit watching the show, and now I see that it was still good after all. From what I read from other Frasier fans, the last two seasons of Frasier really took off again and were up to par with the show's standards. I'm not a critic, but I play one on the computer.

The one and only ""Minus"" for me is there is no Special Features again!!! Is it too costly to get a hold of some of the cast members and do a 5 to 10 min interview? Or better yet, get some of the cast together to watch an episode or two. Its always a great treat to hear the cast comment about episodes. They do that on the Dukes of Hazzard DVD's and it works out really well. You get to hear some behind the scenes stuff. Sometimes the stars surprise each other with new information. I would enjoy hearing from Kelsey, David, or John to get there impressions on the DVD's themselves. Do they like them? Or, Do they own any? I hope for Season 8 the studio will try to get some special features together for us Frasier fans

Even though, personally, this season is not my most favorite, it is still very entertaining. I believe all of us Frasier fans are grateful to have the episodes availabe on DVD.",1132358400,3,1459,4.244604316546763
2400775,4,B000B5XOUC,"For diehard ""Frasier"" fans, Season 7 represents a highpoint as the long awaited Niles/Daphne relationship finally culminates in ""Something Borrowed, Something Blue"" and leads to the best cliffhanger in the series.

The best episodes of the season all have either veteran or new character actors featured in some wonderful episodes. Lilith returns in ""The Apparent Trap"", with Frederick doing all he can to manipulate his parents into giving him a mini-bike.  ""The Dog That Rocks The Cradle"" brings back a finger-dislocating Bulldog and is really a howler. And Frasier's notorious agent Bebe makes ""Morning Comes Entertainment"" (a wonderful episode title) a sheer delight.  The image of her 'n Frasier riding on a donkey while Niles proclaims, ""Via con Dios."" is very funny.

Let's not forget the newcomers to the series as well, like the irrepressable Jean Smart in ""Big Crane on Campus"", she's both beautiful and frightening at the same time.  Kim Coles is delightful in ""Something About Dr. Mary"", an episode that addresses the issue of Frasier's inability to tell Mary the truth because she's black. Which is interesting considering that very few African-Americans have ever been on ""Frasier"".  But the real star is Anthony LaPaglia as Daphne's wayward, drunken brother Simon.  He is terrific in back to back episodes (""Dark Side of the Moon"", ""Something Borrowed, Something Blue"").

Despite some very good episodes, it's clear that the writers were running out of ideas during this season as several shows repeat themes or even lift parts of previous episodes.  Take for example ""Hot Pursuit"", which vitually remakes Season 3's ""Roz Loves Frasier"", although this version is slower and unnecessary. ""Rivals"" uses the same ballroom set as Season 3's ""Moon Dance"" and even has a tango. And ""Out With Dad"" reworks Season 2's ""The Matchmaker"", even Daphne's cackling in the kitchen is identical to Martin's laugh in ""The Matchmaker"".

It should be noted that Paramount has apparently listened to the hues 'n cries of the masses as Disc 1 gives the viewer a choice of either previews or the menu page, unlike Season's 4, 5, 'n 6 when you had to no choice but to skip through the previews.

I really enjoyed this Season even more than I remembered when it originally ran on NBC and it's argueably better than the erratic Season 6.  In fact, had the ""Frasier"" series ended with Daphne 'n Niles driving off to a new destiny, it might have been the perfect ending.  Oh well, this DVD collection stands on it's own and is a welcome addition to the ""Frasier"" family.

Enjoy!

Tidbits:

- GOOF: In ""Something About Dr. Mary"", Daphne injures her RIGHT wrist after Niles accidently kicks her in the behind (a very funny scene). Later on, we see the bandage on her right wrist. But during the stinger, the bandage is now on Daphne's LEFT wrist.

- Rebecca Schull turns in a very un-""Fey"" like performance in ""RDWRER"".  She's becomes the second ""Wings"" star to appear on ""Frasier"".

- ""Fight Before Christmas"" has another first for the Frasier series, the title card introducing the ""Wassling"" uses a different typeface for the first time.

- GOOF: In ""Dark Side of the Moon"", Daphne clears all the trash 'n beer cans off the coffee table and then stands up just before Frasier enters. When we see the coffee table again, a beer can and some trash magically reappear.

- The stinger for ""Something Borrowed, Something Blue"" is the first one NOT to have any actors in it (apart from the ""Thanks for Calling"" stingers that usually appear during the last episode of the season).  All we see is a darkened set.",1132185600,16,3593,4.884678747940692
2400776,5,B000B5XOUC,"I agree with Stratman - where are the extras on these DVDs?  The bloopers, the deleted scenes, the behind-the-scenes goodness?  Paramount, get a clue from the people making the Seinfeld DVDs.  Frasier deserves better!  I still give the DVD five stars because this show is truly one of the best.  How many other sitcoms sustained such a level of quality after seven years?",1132185600,,371,4.825396825396825
2400777,4,B000B5XOUC,"Frasier himself returns for a sixteenth season in the fall of 1999. By then,Kelsey Grammer was previously nominated for and had won a multitude of Emmys for the legendary role. During the 1999-2000 season,Grammer's fans couldn't get enough of the hilarious and somewhat wacky psyhiatrist. By then,Frasier was already syndicated(7 days a week) on a multitude of independent stations all over America and other countries as well.",1128384000,6,427,5.388059701492537
2400778,5,B000B5XOUC,"The seventh season of ""Frasier"" has some really good episodes in it, but then again, that's not really a surprise.
This season is probably my favorite, mostly because Niles finally finally FINALLY ends up with Daphne, after a highly-medicated Frasier tells Daphne how Niles feels about her.  (This episode is really good, but its title currently escapes me.)
This season is also great because one of my very favorite episodes is on this set, and the episode is ""Rdwrer"".  In this episode, Frasier, Niles and Martin go off in Martin's Winnebago (a. k. a. the ""Road Warrior"") for a new year's celebration in Idaho.  However, during a brief stop during the trip, Niles accidentally enters the wrong RV, and a farce ensues.
I also like ""The Apparent Trap"", the episode where Lilith and Frederick come for Thanksgiving--particularly the part where Niles attempts to play a video game.

Anyway, this season is great, and I highly recommend it.",1127952000,38,937,4.949044585987261

2400876,5,B000B5XOUC,"One of my favorite, if not THE favorite sitcoms of my time. I was too young to really judge TV shows from the 70s so let's say from the 80s forward. I put it up there with Cheers, Seinfeld, and Friends. Frasier is smart comedy. I appreciate it now that I'm more mature and have experienced more in life so as to understand the true comedic value of the dialog. As a teenager and in my 20's I had not traveled much or experienced fine dining and the arts so most of this went over my head back then. If you have any sophistication you will enjoy it. Even if you don't, you'll enjoy making fun of Fraser and Miles and their overemphasized importance of being highly educated and culturally astute. Everyone will like Marty (John Mahoney), the father, as he adds needed balance to ensemble of characters.",1482019200,,801,4.418918918918919

Anyways, i really enjoyed this season. I watched all eleven seasons on ""AMAZON PRIME"" and this is the only season worth purchasing (in my opinion). So don't even think about it anymore. Hit ""add to cart"" and do your thAng. I AM about to, myself. Because it will be a long shot waiting for it to come to blu-ray.",1417737600,,615,4.356521739130435

It's also nice to watch without all the commercials as the program was intended to be watched. You don't lose the moment while watching an ad of laughing people be warned of possible death if you take such and such prescription medicine. Anyway, I've only caught episodes here and there on TV but now I can view the whole season with continuity. For me this is a quality show. Never an episode without a ""good"" laugh. I especially like the scenes with Martin's dog Eddie. On a personal note, Frasier and the cast of characters help me through a sad time dealing with the loss of my mother a few years back. They may be nothing like my family but they are entertaining with all their characters flaws and good intentions, wants and desires, momentary setbacks. Basically life's ups and downs, just like the rest of us.",1409961600,2,911,4.461077844311378

2401875,5,B000B5XOUC,"This is such a terrific series.  I never cease to be amazed how Frasier becomes love struck over and over by another woman ""who's just right,"" only to shoot himself in the foot with one fas paux after another. And Niles is hilarious as the quintessential metrosexual.  Each Season has a nice little tweak of new characters and situations (i.e., Daphne's goofy brother, Marty's girlfriends, Roz's new daughter, etc.) without compromising the fun and quirky personalities of the main characters.  The supporting characters are a riot too (Bulldog, Ches and various station managers).  It's all great fun...",1395705600,,604,5.195876288659794

2401908,5,B000B5XOUC,"While many shows start off well and hold true for a season or two before
fizzling out, Frasier holds up very well.

By season seven, I would have feared that Frasier would dry up and become
forced and plodding. Not so. The characters and writing remain fresh
and engaging. I found this to be true with ""The Wonder Years"" throughout.
In contrast, the initially vibrant ""The Big Bang Theory"" seemed exhausted
and thin, grasping for attention by season five.

I can only hope that the remaining seasons of Frasier show the same levels
of quality and engagement.",1390521600,,558,4.742268041237113

2401912,5,B000B5XOUC,"This is my favorite Frasier season, though they are all excellent. By this point in the show's long run its success was established and the writers took the opportunity to take it a bit further, with surreal humor and a wonderfully satisfying development of the Niles/Daphne love story. One of the show's real strengths is the laugh-out-loud one-liners, sometimes slipped in subtly so you have to think for a moment before getting the joke, and this season abounds in those.

The main characters are as solid as always and there is the usual array of accomplished guest stars, including Daphne's brother Simon, played by Anthony LaPaglia, who is hilarious although strangely seems to come from a different part of England than Daphne and her mother. Daphne's mother is played by Millicent Martin and those of us with long memories remember her singing the theme song to 'That Was The Week That Was', the show hosted by the late David Frost which introduced satire to the UK.

This series was one that got all the relationships between the five main characters exactly right and that is fully in evidence here. A brilliant concept realized to the utmost in this season.",1388793600,4,1168,4.864321608040201
2401937,5,B000B5XOUC,"All that time building up to having Daphne and Niles finally come together, and they pull it off!  With all the expectation, you could easily expect it to have been a letdown, or even a full-blown disappointment.  But the team pulls it off with amazing results.  Frasier was not this good again until Season 11, the final season.  Watch every episode and relish the best team in the business at their peak.",1388793600,,406,4.597222222222222

2401941,5,B000B5XOUC,"Frasier is consistently well  written and well performed. Everyone knows their parts and they live their parts. Meaning they own it. In the whole series there are less than five episodes that I find a bit below their standards but the rest are top notch and hard to match. Anyone who loved his character on cheers will love watching the evolution of the character on this series. 11 seasons hardly seem enough. This is my second time buying this set, as the new sets have a single dvd case (hard case) and it fits on my shelf better and is well protected.

2402028,5,B000B5XOUC,"Frasier is one of the most intelligent, witty sitcoms that has been on television. The ensemble cast is perfectly matched, and the acting is consistently believable, even in the most unbelievable circumstances; that is what makes Frasier work.

Season 7 provides us insight into each of the characters through clever and indirect means, and we see the relationships among the characters deepen and make sense. The best part of Season 7 is the season finale, which after seven seasons of waiting and holding our collective breath, finally begins the new journey of Niles and Daphne to the forefront in a very way that truly only the most stoic viewer wouldn't be emotional over.

In every season, David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney bring incredible depth and talent to the screen, making this little family one to root for and believe in. Frasier is a timeless show with warmth and humor that will be a joy to watch now and 20 years from year.",1365811200,,942,4.773006134969325

2402062,5,B000B5XOUC,"Frasier is one of the most unusual and exceptional comedy TV shows, not because of its premise, but because of its superb writing, terrific ensemble cast, and fantastic set of directors, screenwriters, and producers. Noting some 37 Emmy awards gathered over its 11-year run to support that claim, all I can say is that, even after 150 episodes (which brings us about to the end of Season Seven), the show remains consistently hilarious, touching, and absorbing in nearly every aspect. Not since The Dick Van Dyke Show have we seen a show like this, which seems to have taken the 100-show rule (the rule-of-thumb that states that any show, regardless of how good, cannot generally keep the quality ""up"" beyond 100 shows without resorting to increasingly goofy and implausible episodes) and thrown in right out the window. And even though Carl Reiner ended The Dick Van Dyke Show in 1965 at the height of its popularity because he full well understood this reality, Frasier seems to have demonstrated that the rule is not an absolute, and although incredibly rare, a show could indeed break that ""rule.""

I won't give any spoilers, and therefore won't even attempt to describe in any detail what happens in the show, but I can say that Frasier is a radio talk-show psychiatrist who lives with his retired father in a posh high-rise in Seattle. Frasier spends much time with his brother, Niles, and retains for his father a live-in health care provider, Daphne, who is more a member of the family than anything else. The show takes place primarily at home at at ""Cafe Nervosa,"" a favorite coffee shop, but numerous scenes also take place at the radio station and a select venue of external settings. Due the to development of the story line, the show is best enjoyed right from the beginning of Season One, and then watched in order over time, across the Seasons. This is a show that relies of witty banter, irony, and lampooning, and you have to stay on your toes and listen carefully if you are to catch it all. Be prepared to be rolling in laughter through the entire thing.

Beyond the level of comic performance achievement in the show, there are some other aspects of the series that are also unusual. For example, the very first episode, the pilot, was hilarious, something not normally seen in a first episode of a show when the cast and crew are trying to get things figured out. Not here, however; the laughs start at scene one, and never let up from that point on. Another aspect of the show that is also quite unusual is that, amongst all the jokes, there is a punctuated series of emotional and powerfully moving scenes that intermittently show up ever few episodes.

And (how can I possible not mention this, as those who have seen the show already know), ""Frasier"" carries within its story line one of the most moving love stories ever seen on television. It's a love story that takes eleven years to come to fruition, but its it is one of the most powerful to have ever been seen on the small screen. Don't think you can break down and cry in the middle of a comedy show? Millions of people who watched Frasier over the years, laughing hysterically, also wiped the tears from their eyes over this love story. You may, too.

Five stars in every respect, including the cast, the writers, the directors. Even ""Eddie,"" comes across as one of the most accomplished animal actors since ""Mr. Ed.""

Note:
The digital transfer to DVD for Frasier is not among the best, with some banding and noise present in many scenes. Compare this with, say, the digital transfer to Get Smart (1965-70), which is so clear that it almost seems to be an early version of Blu-Ray. Frasier is not like that at all, but it's not that big of a deal. Audio quality is excellent. But its the story and the show that carries the day. You'll instantly forget any imperfections as you get pulled into the story and the laughter.

Also--and I wish I had looked into this more carefully in the beginning--you can save a fair amount of money by purchasing the entire Frasier 11 seasons at one time (I think the savings is about 30 dollars from purchasing each set individually). See it here:

There are many new discoveries and further awareness for our loveable characters. The highlights are Kenny`s reaction to Frasier`s pompous conducting in his ever-growing orchestra of episode `They`re Playing Our Song` and what a song! Other highlights include the episode where Martin plays gay in every way and Niles joins the fun with a dramatic diva exit! Also the zaniness of `What`s Wrong With Dr. Mary?` while Roz produces Gil's show, Frasier takes on a new producer who ends up hosting with him and giving advice that borders on adolescence. Meanwhile the new love of Niles' life is a bitch from hell called Mel who's got her clutches on him and takes on the Cranes and Daphne with insults during brunch at Frasier's in `The Whine Club' and of course all the jitters and doubts before Daphne's wedding!

2402164,3,B000B5XOUC,When I watched Cheers I always thought that Dr. Krane should have a spinoff. I like the show. My problem is with the Niles Characher. He and Frasier are too similar in my own opinion. Also I think Niles was just a replacement character for Lillith. I think she should have been on the spin off. Also I never believed the dad character fit in as the father of these 2 snobs. Funny show but like Friends its a little overrated.,1158883200,3,425,4.2592592592592595
2402165,5,B000B5XOUC,Excellent dialogue and wit.  The comedic talents of Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce are outstanding as well as the rest of the cast.

2402169,3,B000B5XOUC,"'Frasier' was unassailably one of the ten best series of all time. But the creaking in its structure that began with season six became an ominous rattling in this year's collection. It was the last season for which I didn't miss a first-run episode and that was very telling to me.

Here is where the writing shortfall began. Much of the characterization devolved into either inconsistency (poor Roz) or self-parody (Niles's out-of-the-blue bug phobia). And the increased poaching of gags and scenes from previous seasons became glaringly obvious. Most series lose much of their steam after three or four years but 'Frasier' maintained superb output through six and that's very commendable.

Then it became 'Three's Company' and ... well, not so commendable. You can call it French farce all you like but it's still lazy writing in the long term.

Still, as I say in my title, this show on a bad day beats ninety-five percent of other sitcoms at their best. I own it, don't I?",1135296000,17,976,4.832335329341317
