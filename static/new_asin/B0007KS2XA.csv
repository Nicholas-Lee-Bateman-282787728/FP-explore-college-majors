8047813,5,B0007KS2XA,I got this VHS years ago with a  woodworking magazine subscription.  it is about 60 minutes but has some very nice tips for table saw. There is a segment with Mike Dunbar and its the only  place where  you get a complete tutorial on restoring a hand plane from beginning to end. He shows you every step not just some fast motion like on many videos. This segment itself is worth the price of the tape. I have never found a good teaching on sharpening etc hand planes before or since. Plus  Jon eakes  shows you some nice jigs for  the table saw.  Definately worth a look  especially at this price,1305763200,,596,4.297297297297297
