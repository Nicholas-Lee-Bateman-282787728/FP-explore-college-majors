7995908,5,6303369014,"The movie ""Something To Sing About"", was produced by James Cagney, his brother William and his wife Billie.  He was tired of making all those gangster movies, and decided to start his own production co.  This was the first movie showing how well he could sing and dance, and was to show how Hollywood really treated their stars.  It didn't do very well at the box office because of adverse publicity started by the studios.  In my estimation, it is a good movie and worth seeing.
