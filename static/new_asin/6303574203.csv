681316,2,6303574203,"Give director Stephen Gyllenhaal a lesser actress like Barbara Hershey, or Halle Berry in his this film, and you'll get a fine performance. Give him a great actress like Debra Winger in A Dangerous Woman, or Jessica Lange here, and he'll stiff 'em. In spite of looking dowdy next to the beautiful in an underwritten role, and being shunted to the side for a major part of the narrative, Lange still triumphs. The role offers her as little opportunity as her (unduly) celebrated one in Blue Sky, but she has her marvellous physicality and commanding presence. In one scene, laying on a bed, she is a suburban Blanche DuBois. The plot has Lange adopting Berry's abandoned crack baby only to have to face a custody battle when Barry wants the child back. Gyllenhaal's layered presentation of the African-American community and Berry's recovery is surprising, though Mark Isham's score is obtrusive. Berry is well matched with Cuba Gooding Jnr as a smiling suitor, but she lacks Lange's screen empathy. When Berry drops tears on a book, we feel sorry for the book. The racial politics make the hearing decision inevitable, so thankfully Gyllenhaal continues the story to a humane conclusion.",992649600,2,1187,4.969849246231155
681317,4,6303574203,"Isaiah is known as one of the greatest prophets of Israel. Such is the  case with this little African- American boy who was abandoned in the trash  by his crack crazed mother. Three years later his mother, now clean,  decides to reclaim her child. All of this sounds easy but little Isaiah has  been adopted by a white social worker and her family and she is determined  to keep him at all costs. The drama which unfolds before us is heart  breaking as we attempt to decide what is in the best interest of this  child.
  Halle Berry, Jessica Lange And Samuel Jackson give  outstanding performances in enacting the rivalry and possessive claims that  both women have on this young toddler. Poverty versus Affluence, the  feasibility of inter-racial adoptions, marital/parental stability (and  responsibility) and the do gooder mentality are themes that run their  course throughout the drama. All of these elements are dealt with in the  drama and pulls the viewer from one woman's claim to the other. Who is  right? Does pigmentation or culture matter? Above all, what has love got to  do with it?
  Social workers and judges in juvenile courts across the  country are daily making these decisions of terminating parental rights and  placing children in what they see as stable homes. Losing Isaiah is not a  fantasy but a present reality. How to resolve these issues of custody is  the dilemma for all involved. There are not any easy answers and  unfortunately this film ends with an ""easy"" answer which isn't  realistic.
  The little Isaiah in the film, like his prophet namesake  calls these adults to spiritual, moral and social accountability. His  impact makes Margaret (the social worker) deal with what is going on in her  marriage and family. Khaila, his mother, is forced to clean up her act and  become a responsible parent who shows her compassion and love for all  children. Both women lost Isaiah but both have come to grips with their own  sense of self-esteem and awareness in their loss.",968630400,39,2005,4.837278106508876

681474,1,6303574203,"Did you see the perfect, straight, white teeth on that crackhead mother?
And her smooth, flawless skin?
She is clearly not all black, she is mixed, with the baby being much darker.
She kept saying, ""Look at me, I'm his mother,"" but she didn't look like his mother to me.
Are you kidding?

This boy didn't stand a chance.
He could live in poverty with an addicted single mother - - no one mentioned the fact that addicts could start using again at any time.
Or he could be the only black in a rich white neighborhood.
Either way, he loses.
This child belonged in foster care instead.

No one mentioned what would happen to this boy when he was older, such as his teen years.
If he lived with the white family, he would probably rebel against them and want to know his real mother at some point.
If he lived with the black mother, he would probably get into drugs, just like she did.

And, where was the court-ordered therapy for the boy and his mother?
No social workers ever came to check on them.

I felt bad for Hannah.
No one cared about her feelings.

Did you all understand the ending?
I looked it up on Wikipedia to make sure.
The crackhead gave the child back to the white mother, saying that he is better off living with the white family
until he is ""older"" and can understand everything.",1496880000,2,1296,4.338842975206612

681683,4,6303574203,"This 1995 film concerns adoption, racial ideas in Black/white American relations, crack addicts, ghettoes, and class differences.  Yes, it hits all the hot buttons and is still a good story 21 years after the production.

First we have Halle Berry, skinny and crack addicted, with a new black baby son called Isaiah, living in abandoned and empty apartments.  She has no husband. And of course no job and no family.  Only an infant son who is screaming his head off, because he was born a crackhead, too, and is very easily irritated: whew boy!

Meanwhile an upscale married couple, Father an architect and mother a social worker, with a preteen Daufhter, live in an nice brownstone.  As the mother in her work encounters violence and abuse and drug addiction to the point that victims are brought to the hospital for society to straighten out, she receives Isaiah rescued from the crunch of a garbage truck at the last minute, almost dead, left in a box by the crackhead mother.  The baby survives with extreme intervention, thank you Chicago taxpayers, and the social worker falls in love with him.

Yes, she decides to adopt him and her husband agrees.  Imagine that!  Teen daughter Hannah is less than keen but helps a lot with babysitting as the parents are working.  Resentment of all the attention the baby gets is natural for her.

What happens to the crackhead mother?  She ateals from a grocery store very blatantly and gets arrested.  Court is merciful and send her to rehab.  There she finally learns to READ!!  Then she is forced into work and becomes a daytime babysitter for a small white child with working parents in a well-Off district.  Ironically when she does find out her son isn't dead and tracks down the adopted parents, toddler Isaiah is taken care of by a white teen babysitter and they meet at the park, all four of them!

Halle Berry is outstanding as a surly black young drug addict and scofflaw.  Father of her baby is unknown to her but she claims at her hearing that she never a prostitute; she only needed the money for drugs. She shows a Very Worn and weary foster kid of the ghettoes. As she goes through rehab and then begins an honest job, her face and demeanor change for the bette with an occasional smile.  She remains as skinny as drug addicts often are and has moments of looking mannish with muscles and long neck but other times, especially with make-up, hair cut and old style print dress with lace collar, she starts to seem a good-looking woman. I have to admit that I didn't know she was black American.  I thought she was part Easr Indian or Caribbean mixed race. I'm not up on American actors.  Her child Isaiah is much darker than she.

The child was a fantastic natural.  Whether crying or throwing a tantrum or laughing or playing, he is superb!  How did they get such a young kid to do all this?  Using chocolate and candy?  His screaming fit in the back seat was outstanding.  Very very very real!

Ultimately the movie is a satisfying mix of different points of view on race and separation of a mother from her child.  Lawyers are very good at bringing up unpleasant facts from both sides.

Rather than reveal the surprise ending, I can only say that both sides of this adoption battle had validity and I can't say who is really right.  Or rather both sides are right in their way, but what is best for the child?  Our own president was raised by white grandparents and occasionally his white mother.  His father he didn't know.  Obama admits himself that he thinks himself a black man despite his privilesged and white upbringing and education.

White people in this world have their many ethnic groups and languages, customs and cuisines.  But in the black world, the skin color alone seems to give the identity, not old heritage or language families.  Yes, ultimately Isaiah wouldnhave to grow up and see that he is black in a polyglot multiracial world. He would be perceived as black no matter what continent he arrived in.  So he, like Obama, wouldnhave to work out for himself what he would think of himself, if the Jewish Lewin Family kept him.

On the other hand, staying with his mother and suffering poverty and ghetto thinking would probably lock his life into a very narrow box.

I really did think that some kind of happy end was coming wherein the well off Levin family would take both mother and child into their home, since they needed a nanny anyway.  Then the housing and income questions would be over for the welfare housing mother.  And they would all live happily ever after somehow!  Hum hmmm.  No matter which way this story really would work out in real life, money and the mother's lack of decent work or money would be a major major part of it.",1462233600,,4729,4.590692124105012

682386,5,6303574203,"As soon as the movie began I was touched by the passion of this one.  The helicopter circled above the ghetto with a bluesy trumpet and there came a woman's singing, only it sounded like suffering and agony.  Then there was Khaila with her baby.  Halle Berry didn't act like Khaila, she became Khaila.  A crack addict Khaila did the unspeakable act of leaving her baby in a box in the garbage. Later she is arrested as she staggered along in the grocery with one eyebrow raised, shoplifting and looking for all the world like she was drugged. Amazing acting by Berry.
Without Khaila's knowing her baby is saved from the hydraulics of the garbage truck.
Isaiah meet Margaret.  Mrs. Lewin was probably coached to be dramatic in the ER to be as pushy as possible but she comes off a nasty coworker mouthing off at doctors, cussing out judges and generally being difficult.  I was put off by her office bully behavior.  Coached or not I thought it was lousy work.  But she and the family adopt Isaiah, a crack baby.  Things get rough for the Lewin's but they stay with it and have the little boy for four years.
Khaila meanwhile out of guilt and a need to change her life has gone into rehab,  learns to read, and she grieves hard.  She cannot escape and doesn't seem to want to.  She wants to feel the loss of her child and it comes out in tears at every turn.
Eventually her teacher learns Isaiah is not dead.  And the main focus of the story begins.  Khaila gets with a headstrong effective Lawyer and the Lewins hire a black lawyer and a custody hearing begins.  Race is a loose cannon in the courtroom, in the bathroom, on the sidewalk.  And it is race that is a stake.  No one has a grudge against a member of the courtroom.  But the most painful questions of the movie come out in determining the fate of a four year old African American boy,Good film. GJ",1399075200,,1858,4.36734693877551

Several years later, the baby's mother finds out her son is not dead, as she thought before and goes to court to get him back. ""Losing Isaiah"" is a movie that attempts to deal honestly with the issues of interracial adoption. Halle Berry is compelling as the ""gone straight"" crack addict that threw her son away. Jessica Lang also gives a strong performance.  For all the movies that waste our time, this one helps to make up for it. An interesting dilemma.",1266796800,3,575,4.693069306930693

682572,4,6303574203,"Losing Isaiah is a fine movie with drama and suspense; the acting from this wonderful cast is very convincing, too. The choreography and the cinematography are both excellent and although they could have cut a minute or two here and there the plot moves along at a very good pace.

When the action starts, we see crack addicted mother Khaila Richards (Halle Berry) putting her newborn baby Isaiah in a dumpster while she wanders off to get more crack. The next morning the garbage men discover the infant; and Isaiah is taken to a hospital where social worker Margaret Lewin (Jessica Lange) works. Margaret almost instantly takes an interest in the adorable newborn baby and she convinces her husband Charles (David Strathairn) to take in Isaiah and raise him as their own along with their biological daughter Hannah (Daisy Eagan). The fact that Isaiah is African American and the Lewins are white doesn't enter into Margaret's mind; although this might raise some issues down the road.

Meanwhile, Khaila enters a rehab program and she even gets out of jail a bit early for completing the program successfully. Khaila thinks that when she threw Isaiah in the dumpster that night she killed him; but when her own social worker Gussie (Regina Taylor) informs her that now three year old Isaiah (Marc John Jefferies) is in actuality still alive and legally adopted by the Lewins, Khaila instantly wants Isaiah back. Gussie cautions Khaila that this won't be easy; and Khaila's pro bono lawyer Kadar Lewis (Samuel L. Jackson) warns Khaila that there could be some bumps in court along the way in a custody fight.

But Khaila desperately wants Isaiah back. She learns to read, finds herself an apartment in a low income housing project and fixes the place up with the advice of her attorney. She begins a romantic relationship with Eddie Hughes (Cuba Gooding, Jr.); but her lawyer tells Khaila to cool it with Eddie because he's married. When Khaila does this just as she's told, we see that nothing will stop her from fighting to get Isaiah back.

The court trial is full of suspense and political correctness issues soon come up along with the important issues of raising a black child to know his heritage despite the fact that he is in a white home with no black children's stories to read, black heroes to admire or black friends ever at the Lewin's dinner table. However, just when you think the ending is clear there's a curve ball surprise right at the very end of the picture that really packs a punch.

Losing Isaiah is one of those truly remarkable films that choose to deal with an ongoing dilemma in society that cannot be easily resolved. The only negative I can think of is that I would have liked the film to have a scene in which they ask Isaiah what HE would like; but then again the answer to that question becomes somewhat clearer at the end of the film. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in this movie; and people interested in social issues and the issues regarding adoption will want to get this DVD as well.",1240272000,3,3045,4.6841121495327105
682573,5,6303574203,"This movie is one of my favorites...one which I shared with foster parents in my professional capacity as a social worker.

We see the inevitable pull between birth mother and adoptive mother, cheering for each even as the tug nears its conclusion.

One of the downsides of this movie is the abrupt separation between the adoptive mother and the child.  In my social worker capacity, I was able to orchestrate a more gradual reunification.

However, this is a movie and the drama depends upon the gut-wrenching loss.

Well worth the time and tears.",1212624000,7,548,4.849462365591398

682640,5,6303574203,Losing Isaiah Is the best from Hallie Berry. It is the best i have seen in a long long time. I wish ms.berry won an award for this film.  ms.berry did well on this as crack addict trying to regain custody of her son. I like how she was tough to jessica lange and her husband. samuel l. jackson did well too as ms. berry's attorney. I didn't like jessica lange and her husband were nasty to ms.berry,1151712000,,398,4.102564102564102
682641,4,6303574203,"Perhaps the biggest complaint I have with custody battles is that they are ultimately based around the selfishness of the adults involved, whether it be a battle between the child's mother and father, or between the biological parent(s) and the foster parent(s). ""Losing Isaiah"" is an example of a movie that uses this sad truth to tell a compelling story.

Normally, I'd be quick to write off someone like Halle Berry's character (a former crack addict who abandoned her baby in an alley) as someone unfit to raise this child. I'd also be uneasy about tearing Isaiah away from the only home he's ever known. Thankfully, this film does not end there.

After the courtroom decision is rendered, we see a much different Isaiah than the playful, cheerful child we first encountered. Did anyone bother to stop and ask him what he wanted? In an ideal world, someone would have. Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world, but at least we have people who (albeit a little slowly) realize this mistake in ""Losing Isaiah."" Were I to be given the assignment of filming a movie based around a custody battle, this is the kind of movie I would make.",1127174400,19,1142,4.705

682643,5,6303574203,"Losing Isaiah is Halle Berry's best movie. I wish she had gotten the Oscar for this film because She gives a breakthrough performance here as a black drug addict who abandons her baby and struggles to get him back from the white mother (Jessica Lange) who adopted him. Other Noteworthy performances here are Samuel L. Jackson and Cuba Gooding Jr. The film is great, not playing race as an issue, but showing us people as human beings letting the events play and showing us the outcome.

I was hystarical in TEARS!  I don't want to spoil you, but - she (the birth mother) did give back her son to the one that cared for her, because the son was CRYING and not eating a THING for weeks.  This is why I was CRYING because it was SUCH a happy ending!  Gotta watch it... :)  You'll cry, too, if you're as sensitive as I am. :)",1075593600,6,497,3.8333333333333335
682645,4,6303574203,"For those of you that think Halle is just a pretty face...hopefully her Oscar winning performance in ""Monster's Ball"" showed you that she wasn't...but if you still have doubts this is a movie you should see.  Halle is well deserving of an Oscar in this film as well, she plays a crack addicted homeless woman who loses it all and dumps her baby in the trash just so she can get a hit...when she comes out of her drug stooper she then realizes her mistake, but it's too late.  The baby was adopted by a white family and she believes her baby to have died.  The movie takes off from there, the white family raises and cares for the child.  After Halle's character struggles but reforms herself she finds out that the child is still alive.  Then the battle for who is rightfully the parent of the child begins.  Some of the highlights here...Samuel L. Jackson's role as Halle's Lawyer and the scene in which the 2 ""mothers"" meet in the bathroom for the first time...that is a very powerful scene.  The movie is a very powerful and moving piece of cinema.  Excellent film.",1067126400,6,1068,4.469072164948454

682647,5,6303574203,"Since I am adopted myself, I found this a interesting movie. Interestingly enough, the director presents both sides well, and doesn't seem too favor either. This is a relief considering many  ""political"" films that come out today. Many of which, the director tries to brainwash you into thinking his way. (example: Republicans are evil) Instead the director allows you too form your own opinions. This is a heavy film and it will get you involved as well as raise many questions. Such as who is more of a mother? The one who gave birth or the one who raises him? And also just because you can give birth does that make you a mother?This film will leave some feeling that justice has been served, and others it will leave angry. However, this film doesn't have all the answers an it wisely ends unresolved, letting you form your own convictions. My conviction? Some people do not deserve children. But the beauty of this film is that it may leave you feeling otherwise, because it's not manipulative.",1030406400,6,999,4.708571428571428
