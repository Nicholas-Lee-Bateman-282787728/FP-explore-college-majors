8188061,4,B000P0J0HE,"I teach a supply chain course and have integrated these videos into the curriculum.  They're interesting and provide good insights for my marketing majors on the importance of quality and how manufacturing and marketing must work together.  Not to mention, the students seem to find the manufacturing and distribution process interesting for the variety of industries represented.  My one complaint is that I wish there were more episodes on two dvds than just the three:  Harley Davidson, Peterbuilt and Anheiser Bush.  But the three are very good.",1192752000,11,549,5.264367816091954
