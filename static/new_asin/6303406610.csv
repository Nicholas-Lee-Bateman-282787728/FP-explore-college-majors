639261,5,6303406610,"I saw this a few months ago, and it's really what got me started liking anime.  The animation is great; it switches from two different types to fit the characters.  The characters themselves are hysterical.  This anime was based on a manga, which was funny too.  Mink, the main character, the dragon half, has a crush on pop star Dick Saucer, which is a problem because Dick is a dragon slayer.  He is also pretty much an idiot.  He goes around singing his theme song, which is his name, over and over.  But watch out for Damaramu, the funniest character.  I was in stitches when I saw this.  It is definately not a waste of money, so if no one can lend it to you, buy it",987206400,5,671,4.2204724409448815
639262,5,6303406610,"Okay I've seen Slayers, Ranma, and many other fluffy animes and what do I come across.  Possibly the funniest anime ever released.  And like another one of my favorite animes there is a VERY limited selection of tapes.  In  fact this is the only tape in the series.  But there is a selection of  magna available but it is not, however, in English. Oh and for the record  you should be warned this is a slapstick comedy type show it is not  serious. In fact its less serious and more funny than the best Slayers.  BUT IT CONTAINS NO PLOT AT ALL.  Just warning the people that think that a  show requires a plot.  But all in all the funniest anime ever released  ever.  And I mean ever.",956966400,15,684,4.2421875
639263,5,6303406610,"This was the movie that got me hooked on anime.  I cam across a review on a webpage and decided to try it out.  At first, I was a litle taken aback by the Japanese dialogue and English subtitles, but I discovered that I  actually like it.  Now I know why they named those annoying toys  Tamagotchi.  get this movie and read the subtitles during the ""My  Omelette"" song at the end of each episode. Mink is by far one of my  favorite ani mcharacters ever along with. . . well, all of the others in  this movie!  Definitely worth seeing if you don't mind senseless violence  and brief nudity!",943315200,5,589,4.263636363636364
639264,5,6303406610,"A total delight! This anime was truly funny. Who could go wrong with an anime that has laughable characters, humorous dialouge, and a bit of satire.

639265,5,6303406610,"(Movie 3-4 has been released I beleive, but the author had legal problems involving use of certain chemicals...) Dragonhalf is anime in its truest sense, combining both traditional and Kawaii styles. The random acts of  violence will keep you on your toes. =",917395200,,258,5.0
639266,5,6303406610,"This is the greatest comedy anime I have ever seen.  The humor is great, and if you like Japanese humor you will LOVE this video.  It takes a few minutes to get into the format of show, but after that it's nothing but  non-stop laughter.  You keep getting smacked over and over by increasingly  absurd situations and comments.  Too bad Vol 3-7 haven't been turned into  anime!
Really, this anime is indescribable.  You have to see it for  yourself, and be amazed!",911520000,,463,4.548780487804878

639431,4,6303406610,"This is a funny anime, but if you're not used to Japanese style animated humor, then this probably isn't your bag; this ain't Looney Toons.
I'M NOT CONDEMNING THIS ANIME, I'm just saying ""Parents, watch it before you let the kids watch it"".  This form of Japanese humor is much more ""liberal"" than the average American household is probably used to.

Now that that's over, I will say that if you collect anime, this is a great addition to your collection.  This is a collection of two OVA's.  My biggest beef is that it only represents half the manga storyline, which I always thought was ironic since the title of this effort is Dragon ""Half"".  The effort was cancelled after the second OVA; the third and fourth would have completed the story.  It seems that this wasn't received well in Japan at the time, but over the years it has developed a fairly large underground following.  If you get a chance read the manga; I have seen an english translation online.
As is usually the case, the anime is much tamer than the manga.",1429315200,,1026,4.543478260869565

639438,4,6303406610,"What a surprise this anime was.  I bought this anime with low expectations and was blown away by its humor.
Keep in mind that this came out in Japan in 1992 so the humor is a little dated but still great.  I thought this would be like Slayers, but it is its own unique and lighthearted anime.
This is a medieval fantasy comedy that is very enjoyable.  Sometimes the art style changes with how the characters are drawn, I found it cute while others might be annoyed by the sudden changes.  If you want to kick back and watch two episodes of an anime and laugh then this anime is for you.
The only thing I was disappointed by was that there were only two episodes to watch.  The original manga lasted for a few years and this defiantly should have gotten a 20 something episode anime.",1401321600,,782,4.292517006802721

Less than a minute into it and I was laughing out loud. It just kept getting funnier and funnier! I really don't want to ruin it by saying any more. Really sucks that it was only 2 episodes cuz I just wanted more and at the end I was totaly wired and awake. I honestly think that you can't go wrong with this one specially if you get it with Puni Puni Poemy which is just as retarded, high strung and hilarious as Excel Saga.",1224806400,3,589,3.87603305785124
639482,5,6303406610,"If you enjoyed this anime, buy the manga series. The anime is a quick compilation of a few volumes of the series. In the Manga, Mink & her friends are on 2 major quests; to destroy a demon lord & to get a potion that will turn Mink human, but along the way, they get sidetracked by many small pointless quests & lame majical treasures. This, like Slayers, is a Dungeons & Dragons-inspired series, & anyone who's played D&D-based games will get the inside-references. Ironically, Mink & Dick look & act a lot like Lina & Gaurrey, so I could be partly a parody on Slayers.

Welcome to a fantasy world where magic, swords, princesses, & dragons coexist with cars, television, & rockstars. A word where all women are B-cup, thunderthighed, change their clothes every 5 seconds, & wear really well-designed lingerie as armor. A world where all parents are dumb as rocks & all men are even dumber, a world where humans only seem to want to mate with monsters.

& just incase you're wondering, Pia is a little boy; half Dwarf. & Princess Vena is basically one of those cute green blobs from Maple Stroy.",1215216000,,1096,4.558375634517766
639483,4,6303406610,"I bought this about a year ago, ( my sister recommended it to me) and I have to say that I did enjoy it. It was one of the funniest Animes that I've ever seen, not as funny as Bobobo-bo bo-bobo, but still very funny. However, I paid $11 on the Dragon Half VHS, and I don't really feel like I got my moneys worth. Of course, it's much cheaper now, and I would've gladly purchased it for the low price that they're asking for it now!

Pros:
Very funny story!
Loveable characters!
Hilarious fighting scenes!
You gotta love The Great Domaramu!

Cons:
Mink's voice gets really annoying after awhile...
Mink never really beats up that witch with the purple hair, and she seriously needed to be taught a lesson!
By the end of the final episode the bad guys are still alive, and they've never released a Dragon Half 2 in the states, so you never know what happens next!

Overall: Before buying the DVD I recommend that you either rent Dragon Half or buy the much cheaper VHS first. Just because I didn't feel satisfied with this movie/TV show doesn't mean that you won't be, but I think that it's safer to rent it first before paying full price for it and then end up feeling the same as me. After seeing it, it's up to you if you want to buy the DVD or not.
Dont make the same mistake I did and pay top dollar before you're sure that you'll like it. Dont get me wrong, I loved Dragon Half! I just wasn't too thrilled with how much money I spent on it...",1152403200,2,1446,4.212996389891697
639484,5,6303406610,"Mink is a half girl half dragon with some special powers, red hair, horns, wings, and a short tail cause years ago a king sent a knight name Ruth to slay a female dragon but instead of doing that he married a dragon and of course had sex with her and thats how Mink was born, it's too bad she has all looks but no brain. During this video you'll see what she does to get to this concert of her favorite pop star that she has a crush on his name is Dick Saucer.",1120608000,,460,3.8526315789473684
639485,5,6303406610,"I bought this anime on a whim.  It was cheap and I had just finished watching the first season of ""The Slayers"".  To my surprise, this anime quickly lept into my ""Top 10"" list.  Dragon Half really packs a mean punch when it comes to comedy, chibi animation, crazy bad guys, and did I mention comedy?

Plot?  Mink, a half-human and half-dragon teenage girl just wants to be normal, eat lots of food, and swoon over her eye candy pop-star singing dragon-slaying idol Dick Saucer.  But Mink just can't seem to get a break between her dad always picking on her over her infatuation with the dragon slaying singer and the handful of bad guys out to spoil her good time.

Join Mink on her quest to see Dick Saucer in concert and her vicious battle in a world martial arts tournament.  This anime will have you laughing for hours and has a great replay value.  Both the English and Japanese tracks are awesome.  Even the ending theme itself is worth buying the DVD.

Recommended for ages 14+ for brief nudity, minor sexual themes, some blood, and a roasting pet eagle.",1120608000,10,1061,4.50261780104712
639486,5,6303406610,"But the two episodes on this disc pack a lot of punch.  Funny, fast and bizarre, this anime is a real break from fantasy that takes itself too serious.  Mink is a dragon half, half human-half dragon, who wants to see a concert of a dragon slayer who happens to also be a singer and the newest teen heart-throb.

Of course this singer (who is also a dragon slayer) is the same man who the King sends out to slay Mink!

Great humor packed into every second, whether you listen to it sub or dub, commentary of the second episode by Triffany Grant and Brett Weaver, cool closing song (one of the best in Japanese animation) and the normal extras.

Buy IT!",1110844800,,651,4.30327868852459
639487,4,6303406610,"I'm not one to enjoy wacky and insane anime.  However, by chance and whim I stumbled upon this anime, and much to my delight I enjoyed it immensly.  I won't go into detail as to not ruin it for others who plan on buying this anime.  But, I will say that if you enjoy anime's such as Excel Saga, Slayers, and other types in the same vane.  I highly recommend you pick up Dragon Half.  I promise you will laugh until your gut busts open.  So, crack open a beer and enjoy, because this anime is truly a must see, for anyone needing a great laugh.",1093478400,3,543,4.0754716981132075
639488,5,6303406610,"The two-episode series only flaw seems to be in its shortness.  It deftly lampoons everything, from cheesy hero types, to ultimate martial arts contests. There are things taken from Slayers, Record of Lodoss War, Ranma 1/2, Dragonball, and many other familiar series to anime regulars.  Despite all the borrowing from other anime, it has its own very original plot.
The plot, which is really secondary to the comedy, involves Mink (the dragon half) wanting to see her hero, Pop Singer, Dick Saucer (who is also a dragon slayer) in concert.  His profession does not seem to bother the naive, and totally infatuated Mink. In her way are a vengeful King (think Emperor Pilaf of Dragonball), his evil toady-like servant, his jealous sorceress daughter, Damaramu, (an incredibly inept hero type) and lastly Dick Saucer. Mink manages to defeat them all, due to her total honesty, her genuine concern for others, and some really kick-butt strength, due to her half dragon heritage.
Mink, the half-girl, half dragon, besides being cute, is a very likable, engaging character.  She becomes a surprisingly well developed character in this short, but eventful series. Even the songs, (which involve Mink) are cute and funny in this series.  I only wish they'd done at least a ""half"" season of Dragon Half.  I would gladly follow the exploits of Mink, for at least that long. Check out the look between Mink, and Damaramu's bird, at the end of their first confrontation, it's just priceless.",1071100800,8,1479,5.016326530612245
639514,5,6303406610,"Ah, if only all anime could be this funny.. but again, that's ""so far""; I haven't seen a whole lot of anime.  But it's got to be hard to top this one, which doesn't rely on parodies of pop culture or other anime or what-have-you to be funny.. this anime basically tells you that no one-- from the most incompetent to the strongest, bravest, most heroic person-- is safe from a stupid or embarrassing situation.  I love when someone does something weird or stupid in anime-- often times their expressions and reactions are supremely goofy, and it's played to the hilt in this one.  Characters suddenly become 2-3 feet tall and are deformed with tiny limbs and bugged-out eyes-- I love it!!  And these silly situations are what made this movie awesome for me.  Even if you don't like anime you're bound to laugh out loud at the off-the-wall humor in this one.  BUY IT!!!",1054166400,4,868,4.567741935483871
639515,5,6303406610,"Dragon Half is the tale of a cute half-dragon named Mink, and her hilarious journey to get her crush, idol singer and unfortunetly dragon-slayer Dick Saucer, and rid herself of the problems of having a tale, wings, and horns.  This anime is truely funny, and I'd say that in about 75% of these two OAV episodes the characters are super-deformed, indeed, I'd even say there are different levels of there super-diformaty, and their voice pitches change with these levels.  the show really does not take itself seriously, and will probly make any but the most serious person laugh at its sheer sillyness.  However, this is not for every one.  There is a very small amount of blood, some mature situations, and a scene of brief nudity at the end.  However, its all so hilarious that no one should care too much.  If your in the mood for some insanity and hilarity, go out and buy this as soon as possible. This OAV is worth it just for the ending theme!",1044144000,6,949,4.552941176470588
639516,5,6303406610,"I wasn't expecting much from this one, but was very pleasantly pleased by it. The closing theme song alone is worth it. In typical fashion the half-dragon protagonist is ga-ga over the boy-toy superstar dragon-slayer so her actions to assist her hero manage to do far more damage than good. Damarama is too funny...

This has to be one of the wackiest anime titles I have ever seen. The basis of the story follows the tale of a half-human, half-dragon girl on her quest to look more human. She falls for a handsom pop-singer who also happens to be a dragon slayer...
If you love SD (super deformed) anime you will LOVE this.... The anime characters spontaneously switch from normal to SD when you least expect it. This anime is a total wack job...hillarious stuff.",1027468800,2,716,4.233576642335766
639518,4,6303406610,"I love anime, all kinds of anime. A good serious anime, an experimental anime, an artistic anime, and of course, a comedy anime. Having read reviews here at amazon, and at a few other places, I thought that Dragon Half was going to be a new favorite of mine. It didn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, and I recommend it to most folks, but it doesn't quite have the well rounded feel of a comedy like The Slayers.
It's full of halarious pranks, decent voice casting (I'm refering to the Japanese seiyuu here, I have no idea about the dubbed release), and some cute characters. But, the animation techniques killed something for me. I respect the use of ""super deformed/super cute"" characters for specific gags or visual effects, but nearly half of Dragon Half was animated like that, and it really isn't as entertaining to me to see deformed characters going about there business, as it is to see them drawn normally for the most part, and then switch over to preform a joke or gag.
Setting that fact aside, Dragon Half was great. The slapstick nature reached new heights of outrageousness, with falling anvils, unpredictability, and indecent exposuer, all while following a plot that is ridiculous in nature. It's fun, but if your looking for a comedy that you can watch again and again, I'd go for The Slayers instead.",1022198400,,1339,4.677966101694915
639519,5,6303406610,"I picked up this one because my books on anime claim Dragon Half is one of the best parodies ever.  Was pleasantly suprised.  they weren't kidding.  This series pokes fun at typical story lines, juxtapositions things incorrectly and even abuses animation techniques!
First off, it's very cute.  Actually designed to be too cute.  The animation element of ""super deformed"" tiny cute characters is used excessively instead of special emphasis mini-scenes.
Second, the plot is truely wacked out.  It starts out as a medival story but then is modernized with idol singers and concerts.  It's like one scrambled episodes of the ever popular Slayers series with Bubble Gum Crisis.  Makes no real sense, but that's it's charm.
Third, absurdity beyond limits occurs when you figure out what Dragon Half really means.  It's somewhat sick, so it's not for kids under 12.  It's more for teenagers and those of us who still refuse to completely grow up.
Must buy for three sorts of people:
(1) Those who love parodies
(2) Fans of the Slayers anime series
(3) Collectors of ""best of class"" anime",1015459200,2,1082,4.928176795580111

639523,5,6303406610,"Dragon Half has to be one of the silliest and funniest things I've ever seen. In fact it's not entirely unlike a Japanese animated Monty Python! It mocks the conventions of both anime and the fantasy genre (a villain character walks in surrounded by smoke, with a caption pointing to it saying 'Dry Ice' and in another shot you can see a bucket of dry ice behind him; the hilariously inept Damuramu (sp?) comes back after his supposed death as 'Mecha-Damuramu'! Priceless!).
The plot, such as there is, centres around Mink, the half-human half-dragon of the title, who goes on a quest to get a potion to make her fully human to win the attention of the pop singer/dragonslayer Dick Saucer. Or something like that. ;) There's also a bald king who's annoyed with Mink's dad for marrying the dragon he was meant to kill, the king's sorceress daughter who is half slime and president of the Dick Saucer fan club, the previously mentioned Damuramu, who is sent by the king to kill Mink, and much, much more.

However, this series isn't just about the drawings, but about the incredibly silly characters and their often ludicriously silly antics.  There is little logic used here, but the slapstick humor and occasional wild takes make this a fun hour of video to watch.

""Funniest anime ever made"". When one hears the name Dragon Half, this is normally a claim that isn't too far away. Even though I can't fully say as of yet that I agree; this short OVA does make a strong drive to the title and the funny thing is, it only took two episodes to make its mark. This is actually something to brag about since there are many titles either the same length or much longer that end up as total failures.

Dragon Half is like a well disciplined soldier; it knows exactly what its objective is, and it heads straight for it with intentions on accomplishing the mission. From go, the anime is non stop comedy and never, ever, lets up. The interesting part about the anime is that it doesn't have to rely on sex oriented jokes or an overabundance of fan service to get a good laugh out of the viewer. Although they are used in very low supply, it never had a forced feel to me.

The laughs are provided within the dialogue, character's actions, and the sheer insanity on the screen. Most of these hilarious moments appear out of nowhere and they work most of the time. Those out there whom are big fans of characters shifting into the deformed disproportionate versions of themselves will love this one because it seems to revel in it.

Character development is rather low, but this is the most memorable group of characters I can remember from such a short series. The solid voice acting for both languages do them justice and only helps to provide more laughs. The anime is virtually plotless, with things happening at random only to provide more comedy; but a solid plot clearly wasn't the aim here anyway.

Another aspect of the series that I really enjoyed was the abandoning of certain anime cliches. The series isn't the least bit predictable which adds to the fun factor a great deal. The animation is decent at best; I really didn't notice anything noteworthy.  The goofy character designs are top notch for this type of wacky anime, and the soundtrack fits well by meshing perfectly with the silliness. This also applies to the ending theme, which is just as wacky and makes very little sense. The voice acting or should I say overacting, hits the mark every time. Both the sub and dub shined brightly for me and it was pretty much flawless.

Dragon Half to me is a pretty good OVA, but one thing I don't agree with the fans on is the short length. Despite the mindless fun of the series, I think two episodes was enough. This type of insanity for me began to overstay its welcome and a couple of jokes began to grow stale: such as the super deformed bodies. When it comes down to anime comedy for me; one or two seasons can actually damage the show due to many re-used jokes, because eventually they begin to lose their appeal. The anime series Slayers, definitely comes to mind with its repetitive gags that carried through to the very end of the series, and once they reached into the movie features, nearly the entire franchise lost all of its steam and eventually Slayers became a shadow of its former self. Dragon Half could have very easily fallen victim to the same fate.

I only recommend this title to the most diehard, comedy driven anime fans. If you enjoy the comedic elements I mentioned. Then this is for you. If you're new to anime, then I recommend avoiding this and going straight into Slayers because even though I have issues with it; the series(not the movies) still provides a great story, better characters, and a rock solid plot.

Highs: Excellent voice acting, comedy that works...

Lows: ... but can overstay welcome for some",1435968000,,4003,4.554937413073714
