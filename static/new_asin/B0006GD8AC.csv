8041560,2,B0006GD8AC,"I could hardly believe my eyes when I saw this! You can see from the cover photo that the sun is shinning on the mountains from the left side, but on the tree in the foreground it is shinning from, the right. This is a huge technical error that I could not imagine any competent artist making. She does not use a reference, obviously, because the sun does not shine from two directions.

There also seem to be very rushed in a formula driven manner without any stepping back to reflect and make necessary changes. She says you can paint a good painting quickly in half hour. Maybe she can do her method in that time, but a good painting takes time to reflect and change along the way. In my opinion, she does not take the time to see what she is creating.

There are some palette knife techniques to pick up, but I would not buy this video for any other reasons. It could lead a beginner in a wrong direction and has little good information for the experienced painter.",1216252800,,969,4.318681318681318
