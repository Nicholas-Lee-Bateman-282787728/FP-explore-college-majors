6992865,5,B00SUCPAY6,"Well, here we have the perfect example of the perfect storm. The very rare combination of great stories, big laughs, terrific dialog and the best cast you could ever find for the show. Witty dialog that is delivered by some very funny people. I love this show!!!!! The support cast is simply superb and are a credit to the writers and producers Dennis Leary and Bob Fisher. As for the swirling cast they find every week to fill the stories....bravo. Now for my 3 favorite guys in the world....the 3 stars/EMT guys. Kevin Daniels, Michael Mosley and Kevin Bigley....big round of applause for 3 simply hilarious men.",1431993600,4,614,4.747663551401869

6992869,5,B00SUCPAY6,"Instead of adding yet another ""Unhelpful"" to P Magnum's review, I thought I should write my own, in which I would say simply that each episode is hilarious, the Altmanesque dialog so fast and fresh that I intend to watch all 10 episodes again and will. no doubt, enjoy them as much the second time around.  The casting couldn't be better, the writing sharper, the direction crisper... I have no connection to this series whatsoever but I know from personal experience what it takes to put a good show together and these people clearly have that ability.  I look forward to the second season.",1424476800,7,591,4.673076923076923
6992870,2,B00SUCPAY6,"Sirens is a comedy series from executive producer Denis Leary.  Mr. Leary starred in the long running Rescue Me and like that show, Sirens also follows a branch of public service, EMT's.  Unlike Rescue Me, Sirens is a straight comedy and a raunchy one at that.  It revolves around three partners Johnny (Michael Mosley), Hank (Kevin Daniels) and Brian (Kevin Bigley).  Johnny is the leader of the group and is in a relationship with Theresa (Jessica McNamee), Hank is gay and loves to move from guy to guy and Brian is new to the team and is struggling to find his place.  While there is some on the job humor, 95% of the jokes revolve around sex.  While some of it is funny, it gets tired after watching several episodes in which they try and put a new spin on essentially the same gag.  The cast is extremely likable (with Mr. Daniels standing out for his role) and that Saves Sirens from being a complete bore.",1423353600,3,913,4.463855421686747

8699346,4,B00SUCPAY6,"Found Sirens to be very good.  Leads and supporting cast are likeable.  Jokes lean heavily toward sex, awkward situations and the like.  Well written scripts.  Disappointed that the seasons are limited to ten episodes.  Had some problems at first with getting both the discs to play.  Once I cleaned the discs with a drop of mild soap and water, they played flawlessly.",1468800000,,369,4.870967741935484

8699351,5,B00SUCPAY6,While the series hilarious and well worth your time to check out I do offer a word of warning: the DVD does not have CC of any kind. Anyone who is deaf or hard of hearing may find this very frustrating.,1432598400,,202,3.951219512195122
