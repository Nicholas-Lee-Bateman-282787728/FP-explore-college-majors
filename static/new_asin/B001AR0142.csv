But the narration is not attractive and seems like listening to a lecture by the school geographical teacher, which somewhat makes it not so entertaining.  The camera shot is ok but far inferior to that made by BBC.",1228089600,8,312,4.654545454545454

8279123,5,B001AR0142,"Good informative video to educate and expose you of the fun things to do in Yellowstone.  It also includes a video on Grand Teton NP as well.  The visuals do not seem to be captured in HD to maximize the bluray capabilities, but it is still a good video and well orchestrated.",1499817600,,276,4.288461538461538

8279125,5,B001AR0142,"My parents were visiting here with us in Wyoming and we went to Yellowstone.  I ordered this prior to their arrival and it was ready to see upon our return from the park.  I was such a joy to see my parents reaction to this Blu-ray.  They (and I) truly enjoyed the movie.  The narration is done well and the facts that were delivered were superb.  I loved when the movie would show a scene and my mother would jump out of her chair and yell ""We were there""  the joy it gave here was unbelievable.

If you haven't been to the park this movie gives you a glimpse to a world that few have seen and truly brings you to the park.  The wildlife shots are amazing and some are done with such flair you sit memorized by the sheer beauty of the photography.  I am have been photographing nature for years and this film captures the essence of the magnificent creatures so you can enjoy them from the comfort of your home.

Lastly, seeing Yellowstone in the different seasons was such a treat.  This film has inspired me to take the plunge and travel to Yellowstone in the deep cold Wyoming Winter.

I encourage all buy this Blu-ray, watch and enjoy it; then visit Yellowstone for yourself.  You will not be disappointed in either the Blu-ray or visiting Yellowstone.",1473897600,,1257,4.3896103896103895

8279128,4,B001AR0142,"Has some great ideas of things to see if you are planning a trip to Yellowstone, but had some footage which I didn't think was very useful (e.g. avalanche rescue and safety).",1375142400,,174,4.46875
8279129,5,B001AR0142,"This is a beautiful documentary of Yellowstone National Park and a bonus documentary of another park near Yellowstone, which is even longer. Both very beautiful and a pleasure to watch over and over. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves nature and wildlife. Besides the movie the packaging is very nice and the slip cover. Buy it today!",1336435200,,343,4.830508474576271
8279130,5,B001AR0142,"This video is a must have for all nature lovers, and for everyone whom love our national parks. The footage is breath taking and all encompassing, after watching this Blu-ray you're awestruck with beauty and the foresight our forefathers had to set aside these pristine sights for future generations to enjoy as they should be.",1237852800,2,327,4.963636363636364
8279131,3,B001AR0142,"This, for me, seemed like a souvenir disc that could be purchased at Yellowstone or the Grand Tetons. It has very little educational value, and is rather cheep- something like one of those ""picture guide books"" for Yellowstone, except in high definition.

I enjoyed it insofar as I love Yellowstone and The Grand Tetons with all my life, and being able to watch them in high def video made me feel like I was right there again.

My suggestion - if you get this movie, watch it once with the annoying voice over, then cue it up with the music of your choice and just enjoy the beauty!",1233446400,5,583,4.388888888888889
