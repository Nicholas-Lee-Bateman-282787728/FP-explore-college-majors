  Now, for slice-of-life anime fans who go out for lots of depressed crying school-girls getting bullied and made fun of by other mean school-girls, there might be some value. Or for people who can get into expressionless tiny fighting girls who can somehow hold up 50 foot long, 500 pound gatling guns and duel it out (a mere few feet away from each other) without getting hit.
  For me, part of what makes an action scene great is the emotion, the feelings, the realness and the human element seen in the participants. The combatants in Black Rock Shooter feel no emotions, no pain. Without words, they one-up each other with impossible weapons, and then those weapons don't do any damage. This fighting takes place in a dark lifeless world which seems equally fake.
  I cant stress to you enough how lame this series is. Its a failure in every way, every category. I don't usually write reviews for anime, but this one is a disgrace to the industry and I just simply cant look the other way and move on without passing along my thoughts. Dont waste your time, and certainly not your money, on this garbage.",1397779200,,1351,4.56198347107438
8542986,5,B009MBOE32,"First things first if you played the game then watch this or the other way around you will be confused. In the game brs' name is Stella that is a geneticly created war machine. In the anime it's a different story completely, there are two world reality and the other. In the real world mato is a kind girl that wants nothing more than friends, but in the other brs is a heartless killing machine so it seams. Brs and the others are the incarnation of the pain, hate and fear of the girls in the real world. Over all the the anime is great but if you are a otako(huge fan) of black rock shooter the game then you will be disappointed but unlike most I love both.

Also the anime differs from the manga",1383868800,,700,4.147058823529412
