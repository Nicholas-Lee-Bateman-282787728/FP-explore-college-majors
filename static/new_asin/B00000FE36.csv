1211870,5,B00000FE36,"I think a lot of the people who express disappointment in or dislike of any of the films in this series don't get that these discs aren't meant for the casual fan or someone just getting into the boys; they're meant for the serious hardcore fan.  Most of these discs include two or three of the boys' silent shorts (very rarely will they include a sound short), with the rest of the selections being a pre-teaming short, where they're together but not yet a team, a short one of them made in their solo careers, and sometimes a short featuring someone else on the Hal Roach lot (particularly Charley Chase), occasionally co-starring one of the boys (usually Ollie).  'Big Business' is an undisputed classic, a short which seems to be many peoples' favorite L&H silent short, and 'Do Detectives Think?' (made very early in their official partnership) and 'The Finishing Touch' are also very funny and classic.  It's great to see them opposite slow-burn foil Edgar Kennedy (who usually played a cop) in 'The Finishing Touch'; though he co-starred with the boys in some of their sound films, the overwhelming majority of the ones they made together were silent.  The two of them also guest-star in the Max Davidson short 'Call of the Cuckoo,' as two of Max's four annoying neighbors whom he moves to, so he thinks, get away from forever.  The other two neighbors are Charley Chase and Jimmy Finlayson; it's a surprising change to see Jimmy as their friend and not their foe in their silent work, back in the days when he was a star at Hal Roach Studios in his own right and not yet relegated to a character actor, albeit a wonderful character actor.  And unlike the other discs in this series, this disc brings you right to the menu instead of starting to play the first film automatically unless you manually hit the button to take you to the main menu so you can choose which films you want to watch.

There are also two shorts from Stan's solo career, 'On the Front Page' (1926) and 'Hustling for Health' (1918).  Both are mildly entertaining (the funniest bit in the former film is when the newspaper publisher's son is driving very fast behind the cop on the motorcycle and sends both flying into the air), and it's really something to see how young Stan looks in the 1918 short (not even 30 years old yet, and with his hair so straight and slicked-back, before it grew back all funny after he shaved it for 'The Second Hundred Years' in 1927), but even a big fan has to admit that most of his solo shorts aren't really anything special.  He certainly did have quite a few that were funny, inspired, and brilliant, but on the whole they're just lacking that special magic spark that made his character different from a hundred other minor comics of the era.  He and Ollie needed one another to really take off in their comedy careers.",1122854400,,2836,4.586956521739131
1211871,5,B00000FE36,"I will not go into a synopsis of the material as that is readily available but will comment on the series itself having viewed them all.

This is a stunning collection of the early work of the `boys` and is presented from restored 35mm material much of which is taken from the original surviving negatives. Several of the titles in the series, have until fairly recently, been considered lost forever.

Each disc has detailed information on the titles and every film is presented with either the original vitaphone sound on disc (again recently discovered) synchronised with the picture or with a composite vitaphone soundtrack.

Even for those who don`t normally view `silent` movies these are astounding prints of what is now the historic formation of one the most inventive and forever lasting comedy teams ever to grace the silver screen.

Each disc deserves five stars for content, quality and value.",1109721600,9,905,5.013333333333334
1211872,5,B00000FE36,"They are that funny! I bought it because it had ""Big Business"" - a film that was always shown on Christmas when I was a child in Sweden. I was so glad that I still find it funny. The other films are a bit uneven. They are, of course, all funny, but not as funny as ""Big Business."" The other favourite is ""The Finishing Touch."" This is suitable for anyone with the slightest sense of humour. They are the purest examples of Stan Laurel's special brand of slapstick. It goes a bit like a Greek drama: we know it will all end in chaos, we just do not know how. The scene is set at the beginning of the short, the characters are introduced, and slowly the small disasters and misunderstandings build up and amplify. Smiles, lead to chuckles, lead to howles, and finally to tears, stomach cramps, and frantic grasps for air as the short gets more and more unbelievably funny.",1078704000,7,870,4.3765432098765435
1211873,5,B00000FE36,"If you aren't familiar with the silent films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, this is the best place to start. The first film on the DVD is worth the price alone, ""Big Business"" from 1929 (shot  December 1928, released April 20, 1929) is probably THE FUNNIEST FILM EVER MADE...the boys are door-to-door Christmas tree salesmen (not in July) who should never have rang James Finlayson's doorbell. Other highlights include ""Do Detectives Think?"" (1927) in which the boys wear their trademark outfits for the first time...the real treat is Fin's reactions to killer Noah Young. ""Call Of The Cuckoo"" (1927) is a fairly odd piece with Max Davidson trying to sell his house to get away from his neighbors (Laurel, Hardy, Finlayson, and Charley Chase)...Spec O'Donnell is the real stand-out in this film as Davidson's dim-witted son. ""The Finishing Touch"" (1928) is classic Laurel & Hardy, the boys as carpenters has never been better...also starring the great Edgar Kennedy. Also included on this DVD are two Stan Laurel solo shorts, ""On The Front Page"" (1926) very amusing. and ""Hustling For Health"" (1918) one of Stan Laurel's earliest films.
The restoration for these films is amazing, all-in-all, this is a wonderful collection...don't just stop at volume one, all ten volumes are worth picking up.",1074729600,14,1296,5.084507042253521
1211874,3,B00000FE36,There are indeed a couple of good shorts on here but they are supported with some not very interesting material. It's still worth the money but the other material is more for general interest than as being representative of the pair at their best.,1056585600,7,247,4.636363636363637
1211875,4,B00000FE36,"The rest of the material in this collection isn't quite on the same level of genius, but ""Big Business"" may be the funniest 20 minutes ever recorded on film.",1024790400,7,157,4.448275862068965
1211876,5,B00000FE36,"I just want to say I have just received my ninth installment of this must have DVD series Hal Roach Studios Lost Films of Laurel and Hardy.  The meticulous restoration process and background information makes this so enjoyable to watch. (Films as early as 1915, can you imagine?) Being re-introduced into the silent era was such a joy.  Only knowing Laurel and Hardy through the talkies and TV.  This DVD series brought to me a new level of enjoyment watching the golden age of comedy.  I have even joined a ""Sons of the Desert"" tent so I could group discuss and see the other L&H movies (105 total).  I just wanted to say here on Volume 1 that it is a great beginning and an introductory synopsis was necessary for this L&H DVD series.  Laughter through visual comedy is the devine genius of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy.  They are truely kindred spirits that we can now enjoy for a life time.",973296000,11,894,4.481481481481482
1211877,5,B00000FE36,"Volume 1 in what is planned to be a 10 volume series of the early Laurel & Hardy films, most of which have been either unavailable on commercial video for years or have never been available before - that alone is reason  to rejoice and praise the DVD format. What you get on this initial volume  are four L&H originals (one featuring Max Davidson - ""The Call of  the Cuckoo"" - where L&H are in more of a supportive role) as well  as two super rare pre-L&H Stan Laurel shorts. Having these  ""bonus"" films from before the advent of Stan and Ollie is almost  more than a fan could ask for! I'm shocked to see actual reviews of this  series here on Amazon actually COMPLAIN (! ) about them being silent or  missing frames or not up to the film quality of ""The Matrix"" -  these folks are simply missing the point and denying themselves the rare  beauty and enjoyment of these truly maverick film-makers. Hal Roach Studios  in tandem with Image Entertainment (and Richard Feiner and the Nostalgia  Company) have done a splendid job on this series - restoring these titles  from the original 35mm material and in the case of ""Big  Business"", from the original nitrate camera negative. In addition to  the lovingly remastered films, you get some excellent DVD packaging as  well. The case features a fold-out section with the original movie posters  for the three team films (""Call of the Cuckoo""'s poster is  missing and replaced with a couple of stills) as well as detailed source  information and full descriptive notes on all six films. I would NEVER say  that if you consider yourself a casual Laurel & Hardy fan, that these  DVDs are for collectors only - because just about every second of film with  the boys should be essential viewing. Fans who are ""more than  casual"" obviously need no review to tell them they need these discs.  However, for those who are merely interested in Laurel & Hardy, there  really can't be a more wonderful introduction as these films are presented  in as close to original form as possible, and it's the magic of Laurel and  Hardy's screen presence that will infect your life with sincere joy and  laughter.",954201600,30,2138,4.629333333333333
1211878,5,B00000FE36,"Laurel and Hardy were giants of the cinema in their day not only because of their immense talent but also because of the more leisurely paced times of the late 1920s and the 1930s.  People in small towns could scarcely wait  for the next L&H film short, much as a child can't wait for his  favorite uncle to pay him a day visit and then utterly delight in the magic  of the time spent with that uncle.  These L&H films capture that sense  of delight perfectly, because they have brought back the best available  prints in DVD format of the whole range of 15-20 minute shorts that so  captured the nation's fancy on a mass scale 70 years ago.  Do not be misled  by the unfortunate title of ""lost films"" -- this is not a  knock-off series (it is planned as an omnium gatherum of their films); nor  is it ""small town"" in the sense of being simpleton comedy; nor is  it mere nostalgia (though it is a great throw-back to the past); nor is it  a poor-quality series such as the many L&H offerings that have plagued  the VHS market.  This is from the source (Hal Roach Studios), and it truly  does bring back great films that, by their nature as short silents, could  not easily have been separately marketed and have not therefore been  otherwise accessible now for decades.  While these films are silent, you  will discover by them just how visual artistry alone has the power to  delight.  Masterpieces are included (such as ""Big Business""), but  the whole grouping is also a delight:  it is wholesome, it is clean, and it  is funny, often hilariously so.  I can watch these movies any time and  never tire of the subtly recurring themes, the ""slow burns,"" the  tit-for-tat exchanges, and, above all, the larger-than-life characters  projected by L&H that do not simply please for the moment, in a given  place or culture, but rather transcend all bounds to tell all of us --  young, old, or in between, of any era and in any culture -- something about  what we are as people.  For the over-stimulated times in which we live,  these films are most welcomed.",929750400,50,2054,4.5040871934604905

7908415,5,B00000FE36,"Any collection of Laurel & Hardy films rates many stars (except for the Fox and MGM films and that unfortunate final film, ATOLL-K). The recent massive set of talkies that is ALMOST complete is wonderful. Now please!!!! Somebody do the same for the silent shorts. We're talking about -- what? -- 35 shorts, 15-20 minutes in length for each. Why are we expected to have to pay this huge amount of money for these? Are they gouging us just prior to releasing it as a set like the talkies? I have many of the shorts on VHS, which I'm transferring to DVD. These will have to suffice until such time as a reasonably priced DVD set is made available.",1335744000,,644,4.420168067226891
7908416,2,B00000FE36,"Barring a legitimate restoration, these discs are a tolerable way of viewing some of Laurel and Hardy's silent films, but any potential buyer should be warned that these are far from ""flawless"" prints. A few films (such as ""Big Business"") are in pretty good shape, though visual artifacting suggests they are derived from older masters (perhaps prepared for a VHS release?). And the majority seem to be cobbled together from a variety of materials in varying states of wear and resolution, and display a lot of characteristics of amateur restoration (such as the use of magnified freeze-frames for lead and inter-titles). A good example of this is ""Angora Love"" on Volume 2, which switches dizzyingly from fine-grain 35mm to worn 16mm in a totally unpredictable way.

While I understand that some silent films do not survive in accessible high-quality materials, the potential purchaser should be aware that these are far from ""flawless"" presentations.

Most problematic of all is the recycling of a few musical elements, evidently taken from other period L&H shorts, OVER and OVER and OVER for the soundtracks in this series.  Rather than provide distinctive musical accompaniment for each, they have elected to reuse a few scores AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN (occasionally with the seeming addition of badly synchronized sound effects).  I can only liken the effect of this to seasickness.",1270252800,9,1388,5.183035714285714
7908417,5,B00000FE36,"This was my first Laural @ Hardy Dvd.  At the time I could only find ""Flying Dueces"" or ""Utopia"". This was a treat. After watching this volume, I ordered the other nine volumes.  The picture quality is as good as can be and much better than those bargain bin ones.  The music is what really impressed me.  Wheather or not if it's the original does not matter because it fits in well with these time periods. The remake sound tracks do not sound correct on the bargain bin ones.  The sound on those sound too new and clean.  The only gripe I could say is that it would be nice if these were in order of the original theatrical release or when filmed.  The Clyde Cook, Charles Chase and others could have been in their own Dvds and calling it ""Lauerl @ Hardys' friends Lost Films"".  Much like they did in volume 10 with Our Gang.  By the way, I have finally completed my Laurel @ Hardy DVD collection.  Now I plan on buying a few posters and T-shirts and sweat shirts.",1217376000,,966,4.258241758241758
7908418,5,B00000FE36,"As a film scholar fan of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy sound shorts and features, I am frustrated that there seems to be no outlet in the United States for high quality DVDs.  One should not have to go to Britain or Germany to buy decent prints of SONS OF THE DESERT, WAY OUT WEST, THE MUSIC BOX, and the rest of the Laurel & Hardy sound gems.

So it is with great pleasure that I announce a superlative site for at least the long-unseen silent shorts of Laurel & Hardy--and a few friends like Charley Chase and Jimmy Finlayson.  THE LOST FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY is a ten volume DVD and VHS series from Image Entertainment and Hal Roach Studios.  The stunning print sources are gorgeous 35mm nitrate camera negatives that sound as if they were recorded yesterday.  This is your definitive source for silent Laurel & Hardy treasures and curios.

VOLUME ONE starts off with its crowning gem, BIG BUSINESS (1929), with the boys trying to sell Christmas trees in mid-Summer in Los Angeles.  When Jimmy Finlayson won't buy a tree, the boys proceed to demolish his house bit by bit, while Finlayson goes to work destroying their car piece by piece.  This uproarious 21 minute masterpiece is my favorite Laurel & Hardy silent short and close to their funniest ever.

DO DETECTIVES THINK? (1927) has the boys as inept bodyguards to a judge who has sent a convict named Noah to prison.  Noah escapes and heads for the judge's house with plans to kill him.  This early teaming of Laurel & Hardy is a fun masquerade romp with dueling butlers.

CALL OF THE CUCKOO (1927) has an incredible collection of comics for an 18 minute short--Laurel & Hardy, Max Davidson, Charley Chase, and Jimmy Finlayson.  Max was always referred to as ""The Jewish Comedian"" by Hal Roach, not really uncruelly.  It is his movie as his dopey family moves into a house where nothing works.  Doors collapse, sinks turn on stove gas jets and vice versa, lights turn on the wrong lights, and you don't want to know about Max taking a bath while guests are seated directly below him in the dining room.  This one is hysterically funny and the only Max Davidson comedy I have seen.  I'd like to see more, if they are this good.

THE FINISHING TOUCH  (1928) has Laurel & Hardy offered $500 if they can build a rich man's house next to a Quiet Zone hospital in one week.  Edgar Kennedy guests in this one.  It is predictable--nothing goes as planned, and the boys make tons of noise.  But I still laughed my head off.

ON THE FRONT PAGE (1926) has a solo Stan Laurel right before he teamed up with ""Babe"" Hardy.  In the Jazz Age, a flapper countess tries to turn the tables on tabloid publications and a publisher's son will lose his job if he does not come in with a story more sensational than his rival newspaper.

Finally, HUSTLING FOR HEALTH (an early 1918) has an unrecognizabld Stan going solo for Hal Roach during a Summer away from vaudeville.  He is a frantic mess of a person, nothing at all like his immortal later persona.  Familiar face Bud Jamison is the neatness freak who lives next door.  Bud and Stan drive each other nuts for 15 minutes.

All six of these delightful shorts are from 35mm studio prints or nitrate camera negatives, and it shows in the stunning image clarity.  And they all have lovely new music scores or original Vitaphone music with sound effects.  Total running time is about 125 minutes, but you might want to ration them out over a few days to play after a lousy work day.  Slapstick comedy does not get any better, both as movies and the print sources.  THE LOST FILMS OF LAUREL & HARDY in ten volumes from Hal Roach Studios and Image Entertainment.  A random glance at plots at Amazon.com indicates that all ten are worth owning, if you like silent slapstick comedy.  Some of the later volumes have Stan or ""Babe"" alone, Charley Chase, or Jimmy Finlayson mixed in with traditional Laurel & Hardy..",1174435200,17,3896,4.532951289398281

7908420,2,B00000FE36,"A collection of Laurel and Hardy and other film-comedians' early work, in a disjointed series of short silent films.  Not much entertainment value!",1141084800,,147,5.391304347826087
7908421,5,B00000FE36,"This is the finest presentation of what is arguably Laurel and Hardy's finest silent short, Big Business, from its original nitrate negative. The Buys are Christmas tree salesmen in Southern California when, after a couple of false starts, they tangle with the immortal James Finlayson. That alone would be enough to recomment it, but there is more. The Finishing Touch is the forerunner of Busy Bodies and a number of slapstick classics, as they are carpenters attempting to finish a house--and they do... Do Detectives Think? is a surprisingly important addition to the Laurel and Hardy canon as well, showing the Boys had refined their relationship earlier than many had suspected. And all of these three are from the original nitrate negative, so the print quality is terrific.

That alone is enough to recomment this great selection of their silents, but there's even more.

The Boys cameo in Call of the Cookoo, while Stan solos in On the Front Page (another nitrate negative), and there is even a rare 1918 Laurel short called Hustling for Health, which features a treat for Three Stooges fans--a guest role by Bud Jamison.

This is an often overlooked series for Laurel and Hardy fans, but it shouldn't be! Check out this and all the others in the series!",1140998400,7,1263,4.892523364485982
7908422,3,B00000FE36,"This series of ""lost films"" by Laurel and Hardy contain many if not all of their silent film efforts. This first volume has six short films. I'll review them all individually.

 BIG BUSINESS (1929,21 Mins.) - Of the six shorts on here this is the only one I had actually seen before. The ""boys"" are a couple of Christmas tree salesman who go door to door. They are not having the luck they hoped to have had since they can't sell a tree. But as the short goes on that's really the least of their problems. James Finlayson plays a man who absolutely, under no circumstances wants to buy a tree. I'm not sure if this marks the first time the team used what is known as the ""tit for tat"" gag, but it is the best. In fact ""Big Business"" is not just the best silent short the team ever did, it is their greatest effort. A flawless comedy. *****(out of *****)

 DO DETECTIVES THINK? (1927,24 Mins.) - Interesting storyline involving a criminal (Noah Young, who later appeared with Harold Lloyd) who seeks revenge on a judge (Finlayson again!) who has sentenced him to death. The criminal vows to find the judge as cut his throat, so the judge requires the service of some detective to guard him. Laurel and Hardy are sent and we fear the end is near. The story line is slight and doesn't go into all the posibilities that is could have but I laughed a lot so I'll excuse any shortcomings with the plot. I watch Laurel and Hardy to laugh not for heavy plots. One of the film's best gags involves Stan in a graveyard being frighten of his own shadow. It is a variation on what is known as the ""mirror gag"" which Chaplin did in one of his shorts called ""The Floorwalker"" which is probably best known in the Marx Brothers' comedy ""Duck Soup"" which was done by Groucho and Harpo. Also of note is that this marks the first time the ""boys"" would play their most famous characters. It also has the first time they used the ""mixed derby"" gag. Pretty funny. *** 1/2 (out of *****)

 CALL OF THE CUCKOO (1927, 18 Mins.) - This one does not feature the boys as a team. It is billed as a Max Davidson comedy. The ""boys"" along with Charley Chase and Finlayson play a couple of ""cuckoos"" who live next door leading Davidson to want to sell his house. Has some funny bits of business but never really involved me. I didn't really care to watch Davidson. Although again I should say some funny bits. ** (out of *****)

 THE FINISHING TOUCH (1928, 21 Mins.) - In my opinion it was around 1928, 1929 the team really started to jell. The characters were a bit more developed, it seemed clear who would play what character and there was that special chemistry in place. This is a fine example of that. It is one of their ""at work"" shorts, think in terms of 'Busy Bodies' or 'A Towed in the Hole'. Here they play carpenters who are sent to speed up completion on a house. Lots of good gags, but weak story. But again I must point out if I laugh at something I will excuse any and all faults. This shows the team in good form. *** 1/2 (out of *****)

 ON THE FRONT PAGE (1926, 23 Mins.) - Not a Laurel and Hardy short, this is a solo Stan Laurel piece. I've seen a few Stan Laurel shorts in the past and must admit he was pretty good and was capable of carrying a piece all by himself. Harold Lloyd once said he though Laurel could have made it as a single but Hardy couldn't. He may have been right. The short is could of slow but works best when it focus more on the plot and not some slapstick gag that do not advance the plot. It also starts to jell when Laurel is involved.  *** (out of *****)

 HUSTLING FOR HEATH (1918, 15 Mins.) - After having praised Laurel in the previous short I now have to say this is probably the worst on the DVD. Too simple of a storyline to really care about and no big laughs. Not really worth talking about. ** (out of *****)

 Overall this is a pretty good volume to start off the series. I was given a few of them as a Christmas present. ""Big Business"" shows the team at their best. This is good if your a Laurel and Hardy fantantic such as myself or if you are just starting to become familar wit the greatest comedy team in history.

 Bottom-line: This early collection of Laurel and Hardy shorts offers some good examples of how the team grew and shows that special chemistry they had. Two duds in the set but worth seeing.",1135641600,4,4335,4.247873633049818
7908423,5,B00000FE36,"Big Busniness, which from start to finish is either a chuckle or belly laugh non-stop is worth the price all by itself.

I'm sure there are more than a few Block Heads that have not viewed some of the final five films, but they are excellent.  If you know you want Big Business but  don't want to pay the price for just that film.  Don't worry the other five are also wonderful.",1123286400,5,466,4.191011235955056
