436324,4,6302224489,"Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Alan Hale, Arthur Kennedy, and Ronald Sinclair star as Allied airmen whose plane crashes in Germany following a bombing run.  Against considerable odds, they must try to escape across Germany to return to England with valuable information they have picked up.  Hot on their heels is Nazi major Raymond Massey, while they are also aided by sympathetic Underground member Nancy Coleman.  The actors are all fine, not given much in the way of characters to develop.  That's not the emphasis of this film.  It's all about good old fashioned adventure and escapism.  Director Raoul Walsh was famous for his action films, and this film does not disappoint.  There are plenty of escapes, chases, and explosions that keep the film moving right along.  It sometimes almost feels like a big-budget, well made serial.  There are also a few good moments of humour, especially when Reagan attempts to confuse Massey with a description that is complete nonsense.  Unbelievable as the film can be, it's well made and very entertaining, with more than enough chases and action to keep the attention of any viewer.",1027814400,12,1125,5.032432432432432

After their plane is shot down deep in German territory, Flynn, Reagan, Hale. et al, laugh their way back to England.  Honestly, the one liners never stop.  Pure propaganda with some cheesy over-acting thrown in for good measure.  One of the few films where Flynn gets over-shadowed by another actor and this time, it's Ronald Reagan.  His Ann Sheridan line after being woken up is a classic since he had just starred with her in Kings Row and Juke Girl.  Piece of trivia:  the only US President to wear a Nazi uniform.

The interrogation scene (Flynn ""desperately"" wanted but was over-ruled) with German Raymond Massey, yes, you read that right, is one of the movies best scenes.  Even the Germans speak English.  Who knew!  Unfortunately, it's also completely improbable.  Alan Hale is in fine form and steals many scenes.  This movie is so bad, its good.  Pure escapism but don't expect much realism.

The last 10 minutes involve stealing back a Lockheed Hudson that is being used as a Trojan Horse to bomb Battersea power station, though there is no way that two engine plane could carry the huge prop bomb that they roll out.  (Strangely, the Hudson is also used for the B-17 engine startup at the beginning of the film, and is rather obvious.)

This is mainly a chase film, a bit idealized with all the actions that they are able to take against the Germans.  Four men are lost on the mission and crash, then two more during their escape.  Still enjoyable as a period adventure.",1395705600,4,1052,4.542553191489362

436551,3,6302224489,"In 1942 Errol Flynn's best days were behind him - Captain Blood (1935), Major Vickers (1936), Robin Hood (1938), the Earl of Essex (1939), and George Armstrong Custer (1941) were done and gone. He was being criticized for not being in the war, and he was defending himself against charges of statutory rape.

But here in 1942 Flynn was trying to reinvent himself, as something less than a swashbuckler, since everyone was asking how he could be so strong and hearty and not be in the war (the answer was that he had serious heart and other problems, but the studio was reluctant to publicize this). He earnestly wanted to do patriotic films to compensate for his rejection by the Armed forces.

In his autobiography Flynn said - ""How deep the yearning is of an actor who has been stereotyped, who has that sword and horse wound around him, to prove to himself and to others that he is an actor.""

As with ""Edge of Darkness"" and ""Northern Pursuit""  Flynn emphasizes his anti-Nazi activities but kept his contribution well within the limits of mortal man. No swashbuckling here. In this case he is a British air force officer trying to escape from a German camp.

Flynn's crew consists of Alan Hale, Arthur Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan.

Alan Hale Sr. (1892-1950) is best known as the frequent sidekick to Errol Flynn in films such as ""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Dodge City"" (1939), ""Virginia City"" (1940), ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940), ""Santa fe Trail"" (1940), and ""Gentleman Jim"" (1942).

Arthur Kennedy (1914-90) made his film debut in ""City of Conquest"" (1940), and he went on to receive 5 Oscar nominations (""Champion"", ""Bright Victory"", ""Trial"", ""Peyton Place"", ""Some Came Running"") although he never  won (tying Claude Reins' record). He won a Golden Globe in 1955 for ""The Trial"" and the NY Film Critics Award in 1951 for ""Bright Victory"". He was one of the finest supporting actors in film history, appearing opposite Bogart in ""High Sierra"" (1941), Errol Flynn in ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941), Kirk Douglas in ""Champion"" (1949), and his good friend Anthony Quinn in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962).

Ronald Reagan (1911-2004) began his film career in 1937 and made nearly 50 films up until 1964 (""The Killers""). He had a busy though undistinguished career in films, worked briefly in TV, then turned his skills to politics. He's pretty funny in this film as a wise cracking Yank.

Raymond Massey (1896-1983) plays a Nazi, one of his few villainous roles. Massey is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln - ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940), ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950) and  ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr. Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940).

FWIW - Massey served with the Canadian artillery in WW 1. Reagan served in the Army Air Force in the PR Unit in WW 2. The other principals did not serve.

Look for German born Sig Ruman (1884-1967) as a comical Nazi, a part he played many times in films like ""Stalag 17"" (1953). I remember him best in the films he did with the Marx Brothers, especially as Opera owner Herman Gottlieb in ""A Night at the Opera"" (1935). He was also a riot as the Burgomeister in ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944).

Raoul Walsh (1887-1980) directs with his usual panache for fast paced action. Though he's probably best known for his films with Errol Flynn (they made 6 together between 1941 and 1948), he was a master of the melodrama - ""Roaring Twenties"" (1939), ""Dark Command"" (1940), ""High Sierra"" (1941) and ""White Heat"" (1949) - and westerns - ""Dark Command"" (1940), ""They Died with Their Boots On"" (1941), ""Colorado Territory"" (1949), ""The Lawless Breed"" (1953), ""The Tall Men"" (1955). He declined noticeably in the 50s after he left Warner Brothers, but his 50+ year career made him one of Hollywood's most memorable directors.

Bosley Crowther in the NY Times called it ""an action melodrama of the wildest stripe, deprived of the intensity its subject should have by the bravado of its story and characters."" This is true, but it doesn't detract from the entertainment value.

1942 was a good year in films - ""Yankee Doddle Dandy"" and ""Mrs. Miniver"" were the clear Oscar winners and at the box office. Other popular films included ""Casablanca"", ""Woman of the Year"", Alan Ladd's ""This Gun for Hire"", Gary Cooper's ""Pride of the Yankees"", and ""Road to Morocco""

Many films in 1942 dealt with the war - ""Across the Pacific"", ""Flying Tigers"", ""The Goose Steps Out"", ""In Which we Serve"", ""Invisible Agent"", ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"", ""Saboteur"", and ""Wake Island"" to name a few.

Bottom line - not a bad film, but certainly there are better films from this era. My favorites are ""Wake Island"" (1942), ""Bataan"" (1943), ""The Story of GI Joe"" (1945), and ""A Walk in the Sun"" (1945). But if you're a fan of Flynn (which I am) or Reagan then this is a film you'll want to see.",1328918400,,4959,4.7265353418308225
436552,4,6302224489,"Warner Bros. Pictures presents ""DESPERATE JOURNEY"" (1942) (107 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Errol Flynn, Ronald Reagan, Nancy Coleman, Raymond Massey, Alan Hale & Arthur Kennedy

Directed by Raoul Walsh

One of the most exciting pictures ever made (in my humble opinion) Desperate Journey is fast-paced and very enjoyable! Directed by action film veteran Raoul Walsh, the story of British bomber 'D-for-Danny', shot down over occupied central Europe, offers a terrific cast, including Ronald Reagan and Arthur Kennedy (in their second teaming with Flynn), and Alan Hale (in his tenth of 12 Flynn films). The gifted Canadian actor, Raymond Massey, also making his second appearance with Flynn, is a thoroughly hiss-able Nazi Major who 'loses' the captured fliers (after a brilliantly funny scene with Reagan) then pursues them across the continent.  A great chase ensues and if you're like me, you'll be cheering as they approach the Dutch border and the Nazis close in.

Oscar nominated for Best Effects, Special Effects - Byron Haskin (photographic) & Nathan Levinson (sound).

Fabulous Max Steiner score.

436554,3,6302224489,"In this exhilarating adventure five POWs in Nazi Germany fight their way back to freedom...

Errol Flynn plays a downed RAF pilot making his journey through enemy territory disguised as a German officer... In addition to evading capture he manages with his crew, a Scottish veteran of World War I, Alan Hale; a Canadian navigator, Arthur Kennedy; an American Ronald Reagan and a young Englishman Ronald Sinclair, to blow up a secret chemical plant and steal a German bomber from a Messerschmitt factory...

The film (with exciting music by Max Steiner) ends with Flynn leading an RAF assault on the airplane factory after various acts of sabotage & violent conflict, aided and inspired by an anti-Nazi German family headed by a pleasant doctor (Albert Basserman) & his sweet daughter (Nancy Coleman).

The best scene comes early in the picture, when a Nazi Major (Raymond Massey) after having questioned the captured RAF crew, calls for a private interview with Reagan, thinking he will agree to reveal what he knows about the new RAF bomber engines, and recites easily an impressive number of facts about the component parts--all nonsense... Once he has the major's rapt attention, he punches him on the jaw, knocking him out and then help himself to the major's breakfast...",1233446400,,1276,5.037914691943128
436555,4,6302224489,"Of all the actors of the 40s who made WWII-themed films, Errol Flynn was second only to John Wayne in raising critics' ire for 'winning the war single-handed'. His civilian status was ridiculed, although Flynn HAD in fact, attempted to enlist, but had been rejected (despite his robust appearance, it was discovered he had an 'athlete's heart', plus traces of malaria and TB he had contracted in his youth). Even with the negative press, Flynn's unique status as an Australian who was also an American movie star made him ideal as a morale booster for not only wartime American audiences, but audiences overseas, as well.

""Desperate Journey"" was certainly the most incredible of his war films, with it's 'over-the-top' action, and wildly improbable plot (downed fliers reap havoc on moronic Nazis, then safely return to England in a stolen bomber). Certainly, Flynn's ease in both eluding and harassing the Germans, and the infamous tag line he delivers at film's end (""Now to Australia, and a crack at those Japs!"") were comic book heroics, at best, and could not be taken seriously. But the same critics that lambasted him ignored equally far-fetched WWII-themed films starring Humphrey Bogart, Clark Gable, and Cary Grant. The real pity was, when Flynn would appear in superior war dramas (""Edge of Darkness"" and ""Objective, Burma!""), the films would be 'lumped in' with his more cartoonish epics.

All this being said, as a 'tongue-in-cheek' adventure yarn, ""Desperate Journey"" is fast-paced and very enjoyable! Directed by action film veteran Raoul Walsh, the story of British bomber 'D-for-Danny', shot down over occupied central Europe, offers a terrific cast, including Ronald Reagan and Arthur Kennedy (in their second teamings with Flynn), and Alan Hale (in his tenth of 12 Flynn films). Raymond Massey, also making his second appearance with Flynn, is the ULTIMATE caricature of a Nazi officer (speaking the gobbly-gook Hollywood passed off as 'German' in these films) who 'loses' the captured fliers (after a brilliantly funny ""double-speak"" scene with Reagan, which Flynn, jealous of his co-star, attempted to cut, or have re-written for him), then pursues them across the continent. The fliers receive aid from a sympathetic German doctor and his beautiful assistant (Nancy Coleman, providing Flynn's mandatory romance), tragically lose Hale (during the film's most dramatic escape), and Flynn, Reagan, and Kennedy eventually find the convenient British bomber, to return home (so Flynn can have his 'crack' at the 'Japs').

At a running time of 108 minutes, the film seldom drags, provides Flynn a chance to give a ""There'll always be an England"" soliloquy, and delivers more one-liners than many screen comedies of the era, with Reagan displaying a real knack for it (""'The Iron Fist' has a glass jaw"").

With it's emphasis on action, larger-than-life heroics and gallows humor, ""Desperate Journey"" has 'held up' FAR better than many other vintage war films, and STILL thrills viewers in the ""Can You Top This?"" climate of today's action flicks.

It is certainly a 'must' for any Errol Flynn fan's collection!",1126224000,12,3126,5.219123505976095
436556,4,6302224489,"An amiable WWII propaganda fantasy starring Errol Flynn as the leader of a small group of Allied bomber pilots downed behind German lines, who are trying to get home, but can't help making monkeys of the Nazis and wreaking endless sabotage havoc before they do.  Ronald Reagan, who I'll reluctantly admit was pretty charismatic, is Flynn's sidekick; also stars Colonel Klink, uh, I mean Raymond Massey, as the blustering SS officer who pursues them across the countryside after they escape his evil clutches.  The film is notable for the extensive use of real German throughout, as well as the hopeful fiction of an anti-Nazi German underground which helps the men escape.  Reagan gets to mow down dozens of German soldiers in the climactic final battle; I think this may have been one of those Hollywood films he mistook for reality in some speech he gave as President, talking about what he ""did"" during World War II.

Raymond Massey always makes a great bad guy (Chauvelin in the 1934 ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"", Jonathan Brewster in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"") and you even get a glimpse of John Banner (Sgt. Schultz in ""Hogan's Heroes"") as a train conductor. If it's production was as good as Casablanca,I would have given it 5 stars.",1505001600,,810,4.3355263157894735

Fun fact: Reagan received his draft notice during  the making of the picture. WB appealed and received 7 extra days so Ron could complete his scenes before reporting,",1496448000,,313,5.659574468085107
