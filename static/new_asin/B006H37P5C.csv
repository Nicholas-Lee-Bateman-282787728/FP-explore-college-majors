4988122,5,B006H37P5C,These films are so enjoyable.  They are appropriate for any audience.  And Doris Day shines in comedies.  She really was the girl next door!,1355788800,,140,4.75
4988123,5,B006H37P5C,"She has a wonderful voice and love her singing, dancing, and acting in a all of these movies. In this film collection there is Calamity Jane(1953)  she is off fighting Indians; fussing and feuding with Wild Bill, and guess what the love bird strikes them both. In Love Me or Leave Me(1955) it is the story of the roaring 20's songstress Ruth Etting's life and it was a Academy Award winner; awesome performance by Doris Day. In Romance on the High Seas(1948) this was her overnight sensation; a maiden voyage on the romantic high seas and in Please don't eat the Daisies(1960) this a family fum movie about her 4 boys, a country fixer-upper house and a drama critic hubby....all 4 of these movies you will treasure!!",1353974400,2,716,4.637795275590551
4988124,5,B006H37P5C,I bought this movie because of the Doris Day films. They are clean and family oriented.  My favorite is Doris Day as Annie Oakley. Its a musical and the music is classical and very thought provoking about the west.  Just can't say enough about all her work as an actress.,1352678400,,271,4.4
4988125,5,B006H37P5C,be it serious or comedy doris day always gives a great performance. i love her in all the different characters she has played over the years. this is a great grouping of movies.,1349568000,7,177,4.393939393939394
4988126,4,B006H37P5C,"I don't have mant ""sets"" because so many have the titles I own already. This one I had to buy. Here's why:
1: romance on the high seas.  This was Doris' first film of 39 titles she made. A couple married only 3 years have doubts and the wife sends Doris Day in her place while she snoops to be sure hubby is not cheating. Meanwhile the husband sends off a PI to watch after his wife, not aware she's the wrong lady. They land up falling in love . It gets funnier when the wife flies down to Hotel they were staying at as does the husband. Day sings many great songs. Great cast and pure delight from start to end. All works out find as you may guess. but you'll be laughing a lot al the way.
2: Calamity Jane. Western Musical-comedy with plaenty of songs and laughter.
3: Please Don't Eat The Diasies. Later a TV Show. A Comedy delight with David Niven and loads of kids, This film I have not watched since I got the set, but watched some time ago an TCM and was impressed.
4: Love me or leave me. Only show never watched yet, so cannot give honest revue. However, This was one of Doris Day's favorite films she made.",1345507200,16,1117,4.123853211009174
4988127,5,B006H37P5C,"The dvds were wonderful with lovely classics such as Calamity Jane, Please Don't eat the Daisies...love Doris Day..you'll love this DVD collection.",1339545600,5,147,5.7272727272727275
4988128,5,B006H37P5C,"I've been hoping that there'd be a Doris Day set in TCM's Greatest Classic Films series.  This collection of four of Day's best covers all the bases - her signature role, best dramatic performance, and her official film debut.  In short, a lot of thought has gone into the assembly of this set (the TCM sets are often hit-or-miss in terms of what a specific actor's ""best work"" is perceived to have been).

Doris Day is one of the best-loved actresses from the golden age, and seems to garner more and more fans every year.  A successful band singer during the war with Les Brown, she first burst onto Hollywood movie screen's with the delightful ROMANCE ON THE HIGH SEAS, playing Georgia Garrett.  Georgia dreams of traveling the world but hasn't a dime to even cross the street, so she more than readily accepts an offer from society girl Elvira Kent (Janis Paige), to take her ticket and identity for a South American cruise, so that she can secretly remain at home and keep tabs on her philandering hubby (Don DeFore).  Unbeknownst to the ladies, a private detective (Jack Carson) has been hired to counterspy on ""Elvira"" during the cruise!  Day introduced her signature song ""It's Magic"", and went on to star in two more films with Jack Carson.

CALAMITY JANE is unquestionably Day's signature screen role.  Nobody can imagine another actress filling out those buckskin pants and singing ""Secret Love"".  Calam transforms from western hellcat to refined lady in her attempts to woo handsome Danny Gilmartin (Philip Carey), but he's only got eyes for Deadwood's saloon darling Katie Brown (Allyn Ann McLerie).  Could it be that Calam's own secret love is her sworn sparring enemy, Wild Bill Hickok (Howard Keel)?

Day surprised her harshest critics and stunned fans when she starred as the legendary 1920's songbird Ruth Etting in LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME, arguably her finest dramatic portrayal.  Plucked from a dime-a-dance hall by gangland heavy Marty 'The Gimp' Snyder (James Cagney), Ruth hits the heights of Ziegfeld Follies stardom, but also comes under the wrath of his physical and emotional abuse.  For the only time in his career, Cagney requested that his name be billed after Day's in the credits.

Crafted after Jean Kerr's autobiographical novel, PLEASE DON'T EAT THE DAISIES is a zany family comedy with Day the exasperated mother to a brood of troublemaking young boys, affectionately called ""The Monsters"".  Loosely based on Kerr's own life (she was married to revered and feared New York theatre critic Walter Kerr), the film co-stars David Niven and Janis Paige, and introduced Day's sunny rendition of the Title Song.

4988129,5,B006H37P5C,I love Doris Day movies especially those with Carrie Grant and the older male actors,1511740800,,84,4.666666666666667
4988130,5,B006H37P5C,"Among Doris Day's many movies, this is a nice collection.

My favorite:  ""Romance on the High Seas"".  I guess I love most films of Michael Curtiz.

Day and Jack Carson embrace the talent of many notable muscians in the 20's, 30's and 40's.  Muscians Oscar Levant, Avon Long and the Samba Kings had well-written parts/songs.  Avon Long has a fun song about Havana tourists, and Oscar Levant adds greatly to the movie's plot and humor.

My favorite was the bar scene where Levant and Carson drink to the sorrows of their failed relationship to the same woman (Day).  I won't spoil that, but the movie moves along briskly -- lots of talented music and comedy.  Janis Paige has a great supporting role as a wealthy socialite, but still enjoys a friendship with nightclub singer Day.

This is Doris Day's first movie.

Also included on the CD with ""Romance on the High Seas"" is a clip about Ethel Waters sang ""Am I Blue"" in 1929, being the first singer sound in movies.  Very good quality audio, surprisingly given the 1929 filming.

Please Don't Eat the Daisies was okay, but for some reason I didn't appreciate David Niven as when I saw this movie years ago.  Love Me or Leave Me is another Day/Cagney classic, and well worth watching.

Haven't yet watched Calamity Jane!

This 4 movie pack is well worth the money.",1510272000,,1312,4.6147186147186146
