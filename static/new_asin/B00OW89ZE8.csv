8685146,2,B00OW89ZE8,"Endlessly silly but rarely funny comedy about an American bank official traveling to Rome (James Garner) who is mistaken for a spy the moment he steps off the place--the car that was sent to pick him up explodes while he walking towards it.  When he's taken to the British embassy the official in charge assumes James Garner's claims to be an innocent bank official are merely part of his cover story and he gets sucked into the plot to find smuggled diamonds because if everyone already believes he is looking for them he really has no alternative but to search for real if he wants to stay alive

A Man Could Get Killed would have benefited immensely from a tone closer to Charade which allowed that movie to function as a thriller that mixed actual danger and menace with comedy--A Man Could Get Killed instead goes for very broad farce which doesn't work because the material is rarely funny or clever and the persistent silliness without laughs becomes tiresome before very long.

The casting also could have been improved.  Anthony Franciosa as a shady American smuggler with a dodgy Portuguese accent and Sandra Dee as a stateside childhood crush who stumbles upon him while vacationing in Italy aren't funny at all and they get an awful lot of screen-time to demonstrate how not funny they are together.  James Garner shows flashes of charm but doesn't seem entirely comfortable and occasionally overacts, visibly straining to wring some comedy from the weak material.  Melina Mercouri who made this two years after the all-time classic Topkapi is the only person in the cast who seems to know exactly how to play the material and she gets nearly all the laughs.

I'm not sure if the fact that there are two listed directors on A Man Could Get Killed is significant--maybe the less talented Cliff Owen was replaced by Ronald Neame after the producers got a look at some footage.  Even if A Man Could Get Killed is such a dud I can't find any evidence to indicate that it was ever released on home video in any format 1966 was still a very good year for co-director Ronald Neame who also helmed the classic heist comedy Gambit starring Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine.  A Man Could Get Killed, on the other hand,  should probably stay out of print.",1427587200,,2258,4.6936708860759495
