5734962,4,B00CQARYU6,"My wife and her Mother made a trip to China and followed the Silk Road. I thought this DVD would provide an excellent reminder of what they say and experienced on their journey. I also enjoyed it very much and having seen the pictures my wife had taken had a better idea of what the both saw and did.

I would recommend viewing this DVD both prior and after a visit to China and taking the Silk Road tour.",1374192000,4,405,4.1265822784810124
