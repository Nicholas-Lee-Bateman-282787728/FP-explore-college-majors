1810040,4,B00007GZS3,"I bought this video because I decided that I was going to get in shape for my final year of school, so I'd feel better about myself.  I had never done pilates before, but I saw an infomercial for Mari Windsor, and wanted to try it. So when I saw this, I grabbed it.  Wow!  It's impossible.  The instruction is great, and personally, I'm really thankful for the alternate version for people like myself with little or no previous pilates experience.  Besides the fact that I'm still not able to do the whole video in one sitting, its great.",1093737600,11,539,4.404040404040404

1810062,2,B00007GZS3,Obviously I confused reviews when ordering. This CD only has one routine which is like a mini version of Mari Windsor Pilates. It has fewer exercises with fewer reps than the Windsor Pilates tapes. At least it was inexpensive and had pretty water views in the background. I don't recommend it.,1452988800,,293,4.764705882352941

1810089,4,B00007GZS3,I enjoyed the workout. it was a great back ground of Hawaii which I found nice to lookout rather than the boring workout studio you normally see. I did this DVD for nearly week for a year until it just stopped working. I suppose for less than $10 I really can not complain,1401580800,,272,4.150943396226415
1810090,5,B00007GZS3,"love the instructor Ana Cavan, she is great. Love the excersizes.  Not recommended for beginners, more for intermediate or advanced Pilates users.",1391817600,,146,5.636363636363637
1810101,2,B00007GZS3,It's so boring and this video alone won't get you a flat stomach because you still need cardio and none of that is incorporated. The 30 min video seems like 2. Hours. Which makes it impossible to want to do you want a regular basis,1388880000,,231,4.155555555555556
1810102,5,B00007GZS3,Ana Caban is the best Pilates instructor ever!  I have a few of her DVD's and have seen excellent results!  I do these videos in conjunction with cardio and live a healthy happy life.,1388102400,,183,4.352941176470588
1810103,5,B00007GZS3,Love it. The work out is tough . I am more motivated because of it. It's great if you keep at it.,1382572800,,97,3.4545454545454546
1810104,5,B00007GZS3,"I used to do pretty advanced level pilates after taking a pilates class at the gym on and off for several months.  Though the moves here aren't all fully ""advanced"" they are definitely more upper intermediate and some of the moves I  honestly didn't know there was an even more challenging modification for but she showed them in this DVD!

I'm not nearly as in shape as I once was because I got out of the whole regular pilates workout for a while, but I am definitely satisfied with this workout.  There are MANY  other moves that I know that I'd like to be doing to get my abs back in shape so I think I'm going to continue to check out some other pilates DVDs out there for a more balanced workout (and to be sure my muscles are getting the basic moves they need).

Overall great DVD though.  She works at a very smooth pace that's not too fast or two slow.  She's not hard to keep up with, which is something I've found lacking in other pilates DVDs that are closer to the advanced level.",1382400000,,993,4.24468085106383
1810105,5,B00007GZS3,My first pilates experience was with Ana Caban's Beginning Pilates video and she still is my favorite instructor to follow on DVD.  This one is a beginner to intermediate workout filmed outdoors so the background is pleasant to watch as you work through the video. She gives good directions and keeps the work out simple so that you can follow her without having to rewind because you didn't catch instructions.,1379203200,,411,4.871428571428571
1810106,3,B00007GZS3,"I found this workout quite boring. Yes, its a tough ab workout but I couldn't use it consistently because it was quite slow and boring!",1378080000,,135,4.44
1810107,2,B00007GZS3,It's very yoga ish.  Very hard to do the moves unless your already in shape and are experienced with Pilates.,1374451200,,109,4.45
1810108,3,B00007GZS3,"I've had this video for years. 1st time I did it about 10 years again I loved it and recommended it to everyone. Having had a baby 2 yrs ago my abs just aren't the same. I'm slim I work out in the gym , at home with Les Mills Pump (which I'm obsessed with - fantastic results!) and I walk a lot. So I wanted to incorporate a different ab workout once a week. That's in addition to hardcore abs (Les Mills) just to change it up so I pulled this video back out. What I am finding now being 10 years older (39) this video is really hard on your neck. And by hard I mean painful. It's still a great ab workout but with so many other great ab workouts available I don't think I will be using this one again.",1370044800,2,702,3.8819444444444446
1810109,3,B00007GZS3,I can't give a review because I did not buy this dvd. So I can't say whether or not to buy it.,1366156800,3,94,3.3181818181818183
1810110,4,B00007GZS3,"What I love about this video is that Ana is not annoying like some instructors in other exercise videos I've seen, she has very pleasant voice, she doesn't bore you with unnecessary comments. The workouts are challenging. I've been doing them for 2 months of now, and they are definitely helping my overall athletic performance, strengthening the core is very helpful in many sports.",1365379200,,383,5.0
1810121,5,B00007GZS3,This is a great tape with all the classic pilates moves but if you're a beginner order an introductory tape-this one will be too advanced.,1364688000,,138,4.56

1810123,4,B00007GZS3,"I like this workout; however, if you have lower back problems, it may aggravate them.  Just be aware of that.  The workout is not a piece of cake either.",1356739200,,153,4.241379310344827
1810124,5,B00007GZS3,"Love LOVE LOVE this DVD!
Works your abs like NO OTHER exercise program I've ever used. If you want your butt kicked with ab exercises that actually work...this is the DVD for you. Even if you have NO prior Pilates experience, you can do this. I consider myself a total wuss...lol...and I was able to do most of the exercises. I'm slowly working my way up to the more challenging ones. Of course I have to stop every once in a while, but hey, I'm only human...a really out of shape human!

Really pretty setting, filmed in Hawaii with relaxing background, challenging exercises, friendly Ana Caban, worth every penny.

Thanks for reading. I hope this helped.",1341705600,3,657,4.655172413793103
1810125,4,B00007GZS3,I thought this was a good workout and definitely focuses on the abs.  The workout is at a good pace without much talking between exercises.,1330560000,,139,4.56
1810126,3,B00007GZS3,"This DVD is great for the ""light"" workout days. It is relaxing with the beach scene and music, and I enjoyed the exercises in this video. It was simply just not challenging enough and the workout is really short only lasting about 25 minutes or less even. This video does help with my flexibility and helps stretch my abs when my muscles are sore so I will still occasionally add it to my workout routine. I'm intermediate to advanced, so I would only recommend this DVD to a beginner.",1322784000,4,485,4.46067415730337
1810127,4,B00007GZS3,I found this to be a great Pilates workout but the music and beach scenes seemed cheesy to me.  I like to do this at least once a week to balance out my other workouts but I feel like she could have made it a little bit more fun and smiled once in a while.  I used to take Pilates at a gym and the instructor was awesome and played more up-tempo music and it made the whole class more exciting.,1316736000,,394,3.8518518518518516
1810128,5,B00007GZS3,"It was mailed very fast, arrived in brand new condition, still wrapped. I tried the video and it is actually a little harder than I expected, but that is a good thing.",1316390400,,167,4.25
1810129,5,B00007GZS3,"I love this DVD and can't say enough good words about it! A major bonus is that the entire work-out takes only 25 minutes, which I think ideal for busy people who can't afford an hour work-out session every time. Yet it works, amazingly helping to tone the abs! It's also challenging and so gives you complete content once you've mastered the work-out. Believe me, I could barely finish the whole routine the first few sessions, and now I'm on my way to fine-tune the movements after a month and a half of regular exercise. :) And it feels great! The only and minor setback of the DVD, which I decided to forgo given its many other plus points and since Amazon doesn't allow me to give it a 4.5, is that it doesn't have a variety of work-out on the sides except for the spine twist. Overall, it's a great work-out DVD!",1313971200,,818,4.352941176470588
1810130,3,B00007GZS3,I need to go to class for real..  this works but just doesnt do as well as in person class,1310947200,,90,3.5
1810141,3,B00007GZS3,The description of this DVD does not explain the level of advancement or age necessary to perform the excercise.  If you are older or a beginner you could get seriously hurt doing these excercises.  I saw absolutely no warm up or cool down at all.  I would love to find a modified version of these excercises for beginners.  But if you are older and just starting AB excecises I urge you to stay away from this one.,1303948800,,415,4.35064935064935
1810142,1,B00007GZS3,"I workout everyday. I thought I would add some new workouts to my collection. This was one I bought. I can't tell you how much I hate it. I'm in great shape, but am naturally inflexible. I can't do a lot of this or they hurt my back. I am sooooo dissappointed. I guess pilates is not for me. So SAD :(",1299110400,4,301,3.870967741935484

If you already own abs DVDs, this one won't be much of a challenge. However, I found it relaxing and pleasant, and it could become a favorite light evening abs workout.",1297728000,3,1208,10.625
1810144,3,B00007GZS3,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good DVD and I consider myself in pretty good shape having done Pilates for many years.  She moves quickly throughout the DVD with little rest (which I love).  Her voice gets slightly annoying, could do with a little less coaching. I was disappointed was that this was only a 35 minute (in reality it is only 20 minutes of workout- the other 15 minutes is fluff)- only ONE workout.  I wish there were at least two or three 20 minute workouts to mix things up a bit.  If I would have known this (or paid better attention to the reviews/description) I might not have purchased.  Oh well- it will suffice, just wish there was a bit more!",1295222400,3,664,4.32258064516129
1810145,5,B00007GZS3,"I tried this video for the first time this morning, and all I can say WOW. I am a beginner to pilates, so it was pretty tough for me to do. I could really feel my abs working. She has an assistant with the modified version, but some workouts were still a little tough for me. I am going to continue to use this video, because I know that it will help me!",1289952000,,354,3.863013698630137
1810146,5,B00007GZS3,"I've tried doing Pilates years before on a cruise ship and found it painful and perplexing.  How anyone could do a sit-up with no support seemed impossible.  Ana Caban's simple instruction of ""pull your navel toward your spine,"" sets up a great workout in this video.  I was able to do the exercises.  At first grunting and pulling at my legs and now with some amount of control.  The sequence of exercises builds on itself and after about a week I saw results.

The video starts with the easier to do exercises, the hundred, then curling up, and continues with more challenging skills.  The tempo of the exercises seemed fast at first but after about two months of doing this routine regularly the speed seems just right, and the momentum from one routine to another is maintained.

This is a well thought out exercise plan for building abdominal and leg strength.  Recommended by an old, now not as fat guy.",1284681600,3,909,4.63125
1810147,5,B00007GZS3,"Great workout, use this one when I have a little more time. About a half hour of six pack making exercises.",1282694400,,107,4.142857142857143
1810148,5,B00007GZS3,"I also have the Pilates Beginning Mat Workout, Intermediate Mat Workout.  This video could be called Advanced Mat Workout, and I would recommend it to anyone who has done the others.

I like all of them because she really explains what you are doing and takes you thru the process. There is no loud music or scantly clad people jumping around.  She gives clear directions even when you are upside down and can't see the screen.  This is a really good workout with clear instructions.",1273104000,,483,4.647058823529412
1810149,5,B00007GZS3,"I am an avid bike racer- and hate to do videos.  That said, this one is awesome.  Short, to the point and well rounded.

1810150,3,B00007GZS3,"My title says it all. Ana knows her moves and teaches well, but personally, I find her style not particularly inspiring. But that's just me. Still, it's a good DVD to get results and you can always play your own music in the background if you want and still see proper form and good pilates positions. Oh! and she's not annoying, that's a very big deal with exercise DVD's! :)",1259366400,7,376,4.385714285714286
1810151,2,B00007GZS3,"This pilates abs video is not really worth getting if you already have a regular pilates workout dvd, it's about all the same exercises as a regular pilates dvd.",1241913600,2,161,4.586206896551724
1810152,4,B00007GZS3,"Great workout, but you can get this on one DVD with a Rodney Yee Yoga for abs segment and a Patricia Waldron balance ball for abs segment.  All are worth having, so you might as well get them for the price of one.",1237334400,,213,3.953488372093023
1810153,5,B00007GZS3,"I have been doing Pilates about a year and a half or so, so I am not quite sure exactly what level I am, but have been practicing pretty consistently and getting better at it.  I really like Ana's DVDs so I wanted to try this one.  Even though it is challenging it is very worthwhile to do and OI am able to do alot of it.

There are some harder variations on some Pilates moves that target your abs alot and you feel the moves.  The modifications for some of the movements are a big help.  If you have done some Pilates and are feeling comfortable with it, this DVD is very worthwhile for the Ab work.  If not get one or two of Ana's other DVDs before you try this one of hers.",1231718400,2,678,3.9851851851851854
1810154,4,B00007GZS3,"This is a terrific workout and worth purchasing!! In 25 minutes, Ana will give you an amazing workout.

There are a few exercises I am not yet strong enough to do. But Tara demonstrates the modified poses which helps a lot.

All of the abdominal muscles are worked here. Even those ellusive lower abs. The day after I first did the DVD, I was amazed to feel tightness deep in my core.

Great stuff!",1224806400,2,398,4.351351351351352
1810155,5,B00007GZS3,"As a former professional dancer and someone who stuggles to find ""quality"" ways to stay in shape (rather than something like a mind-numbing running machine), I was thrilled to get this dvd.  I don't do this every day but integrate it with my work out a couple times a week; it's a great tool and a step-up from the Winsor Pilates ab dvd I used for a few years.  If you want something challenging to work up to - get this dvd.  (Her program is about 26 min long, but that includes a 3 minute verbal intro that you can fast forward through after you watch it once.)",1205971200,,563,4.194444444444445
1810156,5,B00007GZS3,"I started pilates with Ana Caban, and I won't do anyones else's workout! It's fun, and this particular workout is really hard. But, you feel stronger when you're done.",1202860800,2,167,4.793103448275862
1810157,4,B00007GZS3,"I started doing Pilates about 2 months ago, and I love it. I began with Ana Caban's Pilates Quick Start for weight loss. I really liked it, and so I decided to try her Pilates for Abs. It was very challenging! It was definitely harder than the Quick Start for Weight Loss, and it is not for the faint of heart. She does many traditional pilates abs workouts, but adds a twist. She does the harder version, and her assistant, Tara, does the easy version.

Also, beware of the ""once more"". Ana will say ""Once more"" and she does not mean one more. There may be 2 more sets after she says that. Other than that, I like this video a lot. This is why I gave it 4 stars.

It is kinda short, 26 minutes or so. There is only one workout on the DVD. The Quick start video has a 30 minute work out and a 20 minute workout, and a work out CD, so you get more for your money with that one.",1202774400,,876,3.971590909090909

1810160,5,B00007GZS3,"I've been taking pilates on and off for about a year. I always feel the most challenge during the abdominal focused exercises. This DVD is perfect for that. It is continuously challenging your abs, and you can really feel the burn! Which means your working the deepest layers of the ab muscles. Ana Caban narrates this DVD from 3rd person, so rather than wasting time during the exercises looking at the TV to see if I'm doing it right, I can just listen and pay more attention to performing the exercises more efficiently. The scenery is great, there's no annoying chit-chatting, and modification is always an option. Did I mention the results are incredibly fast? GREAT DVD!",1184803200,6,676,4.786324786324786
1810171,5,B00007GZS3,"I bought this video to supplement a once a week pilates class.  It focuses just on abs for about 25 minutes.  It offers CLEAR/simple instructions, but not too much talk (like the beginner's workout video).  It is just the right pace and offers a great variety of exercises at varying levels of difficulty...you can start at the ""easier"" level and work your way up.  This way, you'll be able to use the video for quite a while.  Definite results in my abs and posture in a short period of time.  Highly recommended and enjoyed!",1178668800,,526,4.542553191489362

1810173,5,B00007GZS3,"Thought my abs were strong until did Ana Caban's workout.  Excellent workout, which you definitely feel the next day.

Thoroughly enjoyed the challenge.",1176163200,,285,5.1521739130434785
1810174,4,B00007GZS3,"To start of with, I must agree with other reviewers that this DVD is not for the beginner.  Before attempting this DVD I took pilates for several months in group classes with an instructor.  Proper form is highly essential to get the full benefit of the exercises and to avoid injury so I highly recommend taking classes with an instructor before attempting this or an easier pilates DVD.  This DVD assumes that you already have information about good pilates form and basic moves and does not provide advice on either.

That said, if you've already taken pilates and want an alternative to classes, this is great.  Many of the other DVDs I have tried are so basic that the exercises seem repetative and not beneficial.  However, this workout challenges me every time I try it.  I am in good shape and my abs still burn by the end of the DVD.  I also really enjoy the soothing music they play and the scenery of Maui.  Even though it is an intense workout for my abs, I find that the background music and backdrop make it very relaxing for the days I come home stressed from work.",1174262400,5,1080,4.469387755102041
1810175,5,B00007GZS3,"Anna Coban gave clear instruction during this 35 minutes session. Very easy to follow also very intense on the abs muscle. The heat from the exercise and the well controlled movement relieved my lower back pain. Everytime after it, I felt lighter when I walked around. Similar effects as yoga, you would feel taller and straighter. It was actually pretty hard to finish the whole session without pausing even in the beginner's level. So the advance in the excersise gave me enough challenge and fun.",1173312000,3,499,4.882352941176471
1810176,5,B00007GZS3,"i loved this dvd, my roomates and I do it all the time. its easy to follow and her voice makes it a soothing experience. if you cannot perform the exercise, her assistant does an intermediate version, making it easy for any level to follow. but don't be fooled, it is challenging! im definately a fan.",1167177600,3,301,4.392857142857143
1810177,5,B00007GZS3,"I love Ana Caban.  I love her technique and overall routine for this DVD and others. This ab routine is very challenging.  Just when you think you have mastered one move, the very next move gives you an extra burn and more of a challenge.  The flow is great.  I do this DVD two days a week with other cardio and pilates and have seen definite results. This is the first pilates tape that I could get my husband to do with me and he likes it too, and agrees it is tough.  This is a great DVD and I recommend anyone to try it - even beginners - to work your way up to the most challenging moves.",1154822400,13,593,3.9495798319327733
1810178,5,B00007GZS3,"This workout video is superb, a must-have.  Ana Caban's instruction is clear and easy to follow, and the workout itself really works your core muscles.",1141689600,3,151,5.04
1810179,4,B00007GZS3,"I have never done Pilates anything before... this ab routine was at a good pace (not too slow and not too fast) and it did target all the muscles in the abdominal area. The day after trying this video I was very sore... and that was kind of half-assing the moves, because I wasn't as flexiable. Overall, throughout  the workout you will find your body in heat, and somewhat sweating. This is a differnt approach to your standard crunches...very effective... brace yourself to be sore!",1141084800,10,484,4.694117647058824
1810180,5,B00007GZS3,"This is a great workout DVD.  Compact at under 25 minutes, but the pacing is neither too fast or too slow.  The workout starts (relatively) easy and then progresses to some toughies at the end.  For that reason, this workout is more advanced than the intermediate, and I would recommend buying it AFTER you either take some pilates classes or master the intermediate mat workout by Caban.  This workout really burns your abdomen!  Remember, the best way to work on pilates technique is to get someone to teach you.",1135728000,26,514,4.730337078651686
1810187,5,B00007GZS3,"I have been doing pilates and yoga for a little more then a year and the day after I did this tape my abs were hurting. She really concentrates on the intesity of the moves rather than the amount of them. It is a little challanging for beginners, so I recommend starting off with something a little easier first.",1135382400,4,312,4.305084745762712
1810188,4,B00007GZS3,"This is the perfect home workout if you've had a significant amount of Pilates training and have good form.  I was skeptical about doing mat work to a DVD- I'm used to taking one-on-one classes with an Authentic Pilates instructor who helps me adjust my form, but now that I have almost a year of Pilates under my belt I thought I might be okay to work out on my own, at home, sometimes.  Having taken so many private lessons, I'd have to say that newcomers to Pilates owe it to themselves to find a good studio and take some classes before they jump in and try to learn from a DVD.  But if you're at an Intermediate level, this DVD is great.

Ana Caban works at a nice pace- she's not manic but definitely not too slow.  She keeps filler conversation to a minimum and her reminders to engage your ab muscles are very helpful.  Her assistant, Tara, simultaneously demonstrates easier versions of the exercises.  The exercises are similar to most mat classes you'll find in a studio or gym, but she adds some interesting twists toward the end.  I can tell that the more I perfect my form the deeper I'll get into working my core muscles, and that's what I really want from any mat routine.

Highly recommended.",1121904000,53,1209,4.4343891402714934
1810189,5,B00007GZS3,"It's not for beginners, but for the intermediate and advanced.

I love Ana.  She goes nice and slow and explains instructions for each and every exercise to the letter.

There's not a lot of unnecessary chatter, nor are there a lot of useless tips.  Just listen to her voice (you don't even have to look at your TV screen) and do what she tells you.

This is the best Pilates DVD on the market.  You can't go wrong!

Thank you, Ana ;)",1120953600,35,434,4.219512195121951
1810190,5,B00007GZS3,I so enjoy this dvd. I have really strong abs and am always looking for a challenge. I still incorporate Beachbody's Ab Ripper X and Cathe's core. I love how this workout gets more difficult as you master the form. I've gotten more than my moneys worth from it!,1117843200,7,261,4.346938775510204
1810191,5,B00007GZS3,"I really enjoy this DVD. I keep hoping that Ana Caban will make an Advanced Pilates DVD and this is close. The focus here is on ABS for sure and it is a routine that can get some heat going.

  I am an Ana Caban fan. She has a sense of humor, good imagery and a pleasant voice. There is a fun combination on this DVD that I hadn't seen before. I enjoy mixing this DVD in with other general Pilates routines for a little extra AB workout.

 If you haven't done any Pilates, you probably shouldn't undertake this DVD. All Pilates targets the Abs--but this one even more, so if you're new to Pilates try her Beginner or Intermediate DVD first. Really. Form is so important. You don't want to hurt your back trying to get a flat tummy.

All I could ask is that this routine had gone on longer!",1117152000,13,789,4.157894736842105
1810192,4,B00007GZS3,"This video is led by Ana Caban, and it is probably her most challenging workout.  In consists entirely of matwork and begins immediately with the hundred exercise.  Ana then moves through a traditional matwork sequence, including moves such as the roll-up, the roll-over, rolling like a ball, the series of five, and the teaser.  For many of the moves, Ana adds a more challenging twist--eg, performing several of the series of five exercises with no arms, doing the open-legged rocker with closed legs as well, etc.  Because this is an abs-focused workout, the Pilates side kick series and back extension moves are not included.  Ana ends the workout with a unique combination move which is a compilation of rolling like a ball, open-legged rocker, the teaser, and lowering down a rope; she then ends with a few brief stretches to bring the workout in at just under 24 minutes.  Although Ana works out with an assistant, Tara, who shows modifications for some of the movements, this is an intermediate to advanced Pilates workout and should not be attempted by those new to Pilates.",1113177600,145,1083,4.890710382513661
1810193,4,B00007GZS3,It is difficult to get to do all the exercises that Ana Caban performs on the video but you can definetly feel the work on the abs.,1112659200,3,131,3.888888888888889
1810194,5,B00007GZS3,"I thought this dvd was excellent.  I found that after I started doing the workout that I was more relaxed throughout the day.  It was hard to do the first time because my body is definitely not as flexible as Ana's but I did find that my body was much more relaxed.  In fact, it is kind of addicting so when others drink coffee to wake up, I now find myself doing Pilates.  No DVD will be perfect but Ana's is definitely one of the best.",1109721600,6,437,4.046511627906977
1810195,4,B00007GZS3,"This workout is not for Pilates beginners!  I am familiar with Ana Caban's beginning and intermediate mat workouts, yet I found about 40% of the exercises in this DVD to be too difficult on the first try.  However, a second actor does an easier version of the moves, which you can follow until you are ready for the more difficult version.  If you are not focused on using your abdominal muscles for all the movements, or if your abs are not very strong, you will also feel it in other muscle groups, such as the legs.  That said, Pilates Abs Workout is focused and efficient.

Ana Caban is a good instructor - she reminds you to focus on your Pilates form and breathing without being annoying.  The workout setting is a pleasant beach scene, and the music is a great background tune that flows well with the pace of the workout.  The only reason I would not give this DVD 5 stars is that it is not for everyone.  I would recommend it only to those who are already familiar with Pilates basic exercises and concepts and are looking to focus on the abs.",1105142400,19,1052,4.38659793814433
1810196,5,B00007GZS3,"this is an advanced abs workout. you need to know the pilates form to execute the movements correctly, keeping the point of control in the abdominal muscles, rather than in the back, sides, or legs. but if you know the form and can keep your stomach in while executing challenging movements, then you will get an excellent workout. the actual exercise portion of the video is about 20 minutes. out of 25, this is good, because other videos take up time with pointless, nonproductive talking or pauses. in fact, that's what i love most about this video. she is very efficient with the instruction, so you can keep moving throughout. i bought this one at the same time as the cardio pilates, about 3 months ago, and doing it at least 3x a week, i am still not bored, nor have i outgrown it. it is great. buy it. buy it i say!",1095897600,13,823,4.38562091503268
