7945910,5,B00005MM6K,"The ""Snakeeater"" trilogy just keeps getting better! After having seen the first two ""Snakeeater"" films, I would have never guessed that the series could just keep getting more and more ridiculous. Despite being made in Canada, at least the credits for ""Snakeeater III...His Law"" are in English this time, unlike in ""Snakeeater II."" The film starts with a ludicrous robbery in a greasy spoon. Soldier Kelly (Lamas) is back on the police force in this one after spending ""Snakeeater II"" in an insane asylum. He puts an end to the stealing and kidnapping by confusing the first robber with a ploy that is unrivalled in recent memory. I don't want to spoil the delectability of what happens, so suffice it to say that his actions get him suspended from the force. I know: you're surprised.

His suspension gets a lot of press attention, and a couple, the Mollisons, call Soldier and ask him to freelance for them while he's on the enforced sabbatical from his day job. It seems that their lovely daughter, Vivian (Tracy Hway,) was getting her master's degree in sociology (no good can come of that) and her thesis was on the ""Hierarchy of Modern Tribes, Specifically Motorcycle Gangs."" (Of course it was.) Vivian found a gang that was willing to let her tag along for a weekend: ten months later she reemerged as an emotionally-scarred hulk a hundred miles away. The Mollisons want Soldier to find the people who did it and exterminate them, as the police are ineffective. Soldier takes the job (his fee: one bag of home-grown tomatoes) and immediately contacts an old friend, Cowboy (Minor Mustain,) a Private Investigator, who agrees to become partners to solve the case. There's also a bunch of ridiculous backstory about Cowboy having once been a biker, etc., but it really just pads the running time.

After Soldier goes antique shopping (!) in what is actually a pretty funny scene, he meets up with his girlfriend, just in time to have to leave her for an emergency at the Mollison house: Vivian is missing. In a shrewd piece of detective work (with a really gross resolution in a moving van) Soldier finds Vivian and returns her home. Cowboy discovers that the biker who took Vivian is named Goose (professional wrestler and genuinely scary persona Bam Bam Bigelow,) and I believe that some others in the audience besides myself would doubt the authenticity of Soldier's confidence in the presence of Goose, particularly when Soldier runs over Goose's Harley and then shoots him in the foot to get information from him. He discovers that Vivian was sold to another motorcycle gang headed by Turk (Chip Chuipka,) and makes a nasty enemy in the process, hence the very elaborate toilet electrocution scene (""There's more than one way to cook a goose,"") but I'm getting ahead of myself.

While all that's going on, Vivian's gone again. This time she's been recaptured in the desert hideaway of Turk and company in his near-impenetrable fortress of scum. As you no doubt know, it all comes down to a bullet-laden finale. Cowboy seizes the moment with a snowplow, and Soldier, Cowboy, and Vivian escape to bright futures with the help of some dynamite. At the end Vivian is miraculously turned back into a well-adjusted and beautiful woman, romance flourishes for Soldier, and Cowboy has the clueless lack of self-awareness of a serial third wheel.

The DVD also includes some biographies, a trailer, and a hilarious tribute to Canadian cinema in both French and English. This is the perfect finish to Lorenzo Lamas' epic law and disorder trilogy that unflinchingly and unintentionally commits satire upon so many better movies. If this doesn't make you laugh, you don't like B-movies.",1282435200,,3684,4.908507223113965
7945911,5,B00005MM6K,"As with the other 2 Snakeeater movies.. this one is the better one.. typical Lamas' movie..  If you are a Lamas fan.. this movie is for you..  Bam Bam Bigelo helps the movie out.

It worth it to watch this one.",1255132800,2,210,4.073170731707317
7945912,5,B00005MM6K,"Yes, boys and girls, our old buddy Soldier is back, this time with a script BASED ON A BOOK (""Rafferty's Rules"" by Glenn Duncan)! Whooo! Well, believe it or not, that book was based on an old episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" (I am not making this up). See, this hot, nubile young teenager (Tracy Cook) is abducted by a motorcycle gang and made into their sex-slave (that's the part from ""Unsolved..""). But the parents aren't giving up. They decide to hire the craziest cop this side of San Francisco: Soldier Kelly, to hunt down and kill the bikers and bring back the daughter. Soldier takes the job and that's where Soldier runs smack-dab into BAM-BAM BIGELOW! He of the tatooed head and short temper. Remember when he kicked Ric Flair in the crotch at Wrestlemania 9? I always say the presence of a pro-wrestler in the cast is a sign of a true character-driven movie.

 Anyway, Soldier tracks the guys down with his new sidekick (what happened to Speedboat?), the small, skinny and ineffective Cowboy (Minor Mustain). Lots of gunfights, cowardly traps inspired no-doubt by late-night readings of ""Soldier of Fortune"" magazine, and lots of NUDITY! Yes! Nudity is back and back in a big way in Snakeeater 3! The hot daughter is naked most of the film, as is the even sexier exotic dancer, Holly (Holly Chester). Oh, and even Soldier's girlfriend is naked! I'm naked, too! Bam-Bam Bigelow, however, is not naked, so that's good. Regardless, this is actually a darn good, shoot 'em up kind of movie where most of the good guys make it out in the end. Good, harmless fun. Except for the graphic violence. And the bad language. And the nudity. No Special Features so to speak, but lots of Special Forces. Ah, go ahead and BUY IT ALREADY!!!!",1090454400,5,1735,4.685245901639345
