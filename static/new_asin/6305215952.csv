Watch it and you'll see what I mean--all the pieces are there, they just don't get used quite right.  It's like watching the rough draft of a better movie.  Traci Lords, meanwhile--you get the sense she could carry her weight in a better movie.  If you're a big fan of her recent career, go ahead and spring for this dvd.",1053216000,13,400,4.364864864864865
990705,5,6305215952,"This movie is about a Young Woman who is following her dreams of becoming a writer, but she experiences tough obstacles to obtain her goals. In the beginning of the film she plays a news reporter who is working for this Rock type/alternative magazine, and her first job assignment is to interview a woman who is cheating on her husband, with another man who is ""Bob"". The Actor who plays ""Bob"" is Brian Bloom.
This movie has a great plot, and all the actors do a Fine Perfomance: Tracy Lords, Maria Diaz, Brian Bloom,& Jeff Fahey (Lawn mower man). I recommend this movie to all, it is quite good, it has mystery, and suspense. I also have to say that Tracy Lords is very pretty;The protagonist of the movie.",970531200,13,707,4.488372093023256

990707,4,6305215952,"I really need lunch, so you can bet that writing this review is important to me if I am putting off lunch to do it. So here goes:
This is an erotic thriller, so you would expect Traci to be naked. But you see, she won't do  nude scenes now. At least that's what she says. Why? I guess she figures  that we've seen enough of her, and if you want to see her nude you have to  buy Traci I Love, and let me tell you, she's a hell of a lot more than just  nude in that one.
Not that there isn't plenty of nudity in Extramarital  (there is), and not that Traci still isn't the sexiest woman in the world  (she is). And she's sort of nude: no nipples, but plenty of ... panty  and hands-on-breasts sort of shots.
So if you are a Traci fan, go for  it.",967420800,19,744,3.848684210526316

7885404,3,6305215952,"This review is for the Amazon VOD rental of this film. So much has been said about
Traci Lords over the years there is not much I can add. She is a very beautiful
woman and a fairly good actress. This film is one of the many sexual thrillers
out there and it is pretty run of the mill. Lords does a pretty good job in the
lead role as a writer with both a troubled marriage and career. Jeff Fahey is
her very demanding boss. Plenty of nudity and sex with a decent story line. This
film won't win any awards but not bad for the VOD rental price.",1288569600,3,544,3.9545454545454546
7885405,3,6305215952,"Will there ever be an end to the hundreds of Basic Instinct thrillers crowding shelves at Blockbuster? Bo Derek has one. Pamela Anderson, too. Even Madonna!  Name a cute blonde who's posed nude and wants to prove her intelligence while scaring the stalkers and tabloid photographers away. She's made a film like this one. Traci in her bio explored a schizoid conflict in her personality. She at one time liked porn roles, but was punished for it. So she reworks her image as a talented and smart actress out for revenge on abusive men. She wants an erotic character to play and a dominant intellectual one at the same time. She's scared of sex but likes it. I will admit I was surprised that the magazine editor who gave her the assignment (Jeff Fahey) turned out to be the villain. But his southern accent didn't quite blend with the San Francisco setting. Traci wears some fake glasses for a few scenes to help impress us with her intelligence as a magazine writer. The plot loses logic when the girl she interviews is murdered and the film continues on like she's just missing with a distress message recorded on tape. No explanation is given on how the murder could be covered up for a long period of time with so many fingers pointing to foul play.",1284854400,5,1253,4.568888888888889
