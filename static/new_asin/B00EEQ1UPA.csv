8604804,4,B00EEQ1UPA,"Tentative 4 stars, will review after viewing. Some episodes are reported to be remastered.
Have seen some remastered and video is crisp and clean, also some are widescreen.

The last season episodes are dark and it's noticeable the toll of poor health of Brett. Sad that like Raymond Burr- died before doing more work.",1476489600,,318,4.888888888888889
8604805,5,B00EEQ1UPA,"Jeremy Brett is the quintessential Holmes, Hardwick is his equal as Watson.  I especially enjoy the episodes when Charles Grey does his best as Mycroff.  All in all it is perhaps the best adaption of Sir A's work to small or large screen.  I have owned the VHS, DVD and now Blu ray, which I might add are excellent quality.  Much better than many ""shake and bake"" conversions from film or tape to 1080p.",1415836800,,403,4.405405405405405
8604806,5,B00EEQ1UPA,Love this series.  Best ever!,1404432000,,29,4.8
8604807,5,B00EEQ1UPA,"Just purchased this set from Amazon.es it is a region free format it will play in any blue ray player. I have played random episodes from each disc, picture is sharper than the standard dvd set, the audio is about the same. All the episodes are here only the Edward Hardwicke interview & the Holmes museum feature are not included. Do buy it from Amazon.es I saved at least $30.00, and enjoy the best Sherlock Holmes - Jeremy Brett's version (sorry Rathbone and Cumberbatch) in high definition.",1402963200,,494,4.689655172413793
8604808,5,B00EEQ1UPA,"The minor irritants of navigating the Spanish menu and getting to the English versions evaporates the moment the familiar strains of the series theme song signals the title scenes unfolding in the clarity of Blu-Ray banishing all those old eye irritants of the old video versions from your memory in a flash.  The entire series of Jeremy Brett's incredible performance including all the movie length mysteries as well.  Rest assured this is the complete set.

Now that David Suchet has laid aside his hat and cane as the definitive Poirot (Series 13 the last of the lot comes out on June 23) you can have these two magnificent portrayals side by side on your shelf with endless hours of superb Doyle and Christie mysteries in pristine picture and sound to cherish for the remainder of your life.

The two most complete embodiments of the two most famous Detectives in fiction are finally available in the best versions we're ever going to see.  So spread the word my friend, spread the word!  And at $100 the Sherlock Holmes collection is a steal.

What to do?  What to Do?  Should I buy?  Should I buy?  I would think the answer to that should be elementary to your little grey cells!!!",1402876800,,1187,4.658653846153846
8604809,5,B00EEQ1UPA,"I am a huge fan of Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes portrayal. The Granada TV production is by far the best I've seen. I used to stream the episodes on Netflix, but then they removed the series. So then I turned to Amazon to buy episodes, and own them in standard definition. Owning the series on DVD was always a desire, but I didn't want to settle for standard definition after I heard a rumor that they would be available on BluRay. Sure enough, here they are- and well worth the cost! I've seen every episode probably a dozen times in standard definition, but seeing them on BluRay has been amazing- so many new details in crisp, bright color. It allows the viewer to really appreciate the amount of effort put into staging, sets, costuming, and so on. The sound is much better too (I'm assuming that was remastered as well.) These discs will play two languages: Castillian Spanish, and English. The default setting is Spanish, so when you pop a DVD in, you'll see a menu on the right which says ""Idiomas."" That means ""languages."" So, just use your DVD remote to select ""Idiomas"" and then choose Ingles (English) and you're all set. Happy viewing!",1395792000,7,1149,4.609756097560975
8604810,4,B00EEQ1UPA,"It took me a great deal of time to make these DVDs play in English on my Blu-Ray DVD player. First I changed all the DVD menu settings to English. That did not help. Next I pushed the remote button labelled ""Disk Menu"". That returned the disk to the beginning, but no menu appeared. It was pure luck that I noticed a symbol or a word on the bottom right of the screen that identifies the various tracks on the DVD. I cant quite make out what it says, but it looks like this: ||)|()MAS. Anyway, I selected it and the option of Spanish or English appeared. Changing to English solved the problem.

Although I have not viewed the DVDs completely, they look great. Still, I rated it 4 stars because instructions should have been included for this obscure option.",1393891200,3,758,4.414285714285715
8604811,5,B00EEQ1UPA,"The number of film/video productions that have tried to cash in on Conan Doyle's ace detective seem almost numberless. A few have been decent, but none, apart from the better productions in this series, has truly captured the essence of both Doyle's characters and the mysteries they solved together.  The Sherlock Holmes Collection is not uniformly excellent -- both the writing and Jeremy Brett's performances lost something towards the end of the ten year run. But much is so good that this Holmes fan can hardly believe it.

I've watched the series through time and time again, first when it aired on PBS's ""Mystery,"" then on a poorly mastered set of CDs. I purchased upon their first release.  But this set in the Blu Ray format, made for sale in Spain but available here in the US on Amazon, is what the series -- which fortunately was originally shot on film, not the low-res video of its time -- really deserves.

The packaging is so-so.  The discs are packed two to a Blu-Ray case with rather nondescript graphics that make it hard to quickly distinguish one set from the next. These are held together by a light weight paper wrap-around. The discs when inserted in a Blu-Ray player load quickly bringing up an index screen solely in spanish, and to hear the original English (non-dubbed) sound track one must first go to the language selector and choose ""Ingls.""  All of this though becomes meaningless and trivial once the program begins. The image is for the most part excellent with good shadow details. Not as ""crisp,"" perhaps, as one could ultimately wish for, but film-like and supremely watchable with a lot of fine detail.

Someday the copywrite owners of this material may make a yet better offering with the American audience in mind. But these more than do the job.  Thank you Amazon for making them available, and at a quite reasonable price!

Ten discs. All the adventures.  (Many of which do not appear to be listed on the Amazon site product description.)  If you love the Jeremy Brett Holmes series this is for you!",1393459200,8,2041,4.737288135593221
8604812,4,B00EEQ1UPA,"At first I was a bit hesitant to buy this collection, which was apparently produced for the European Spanish language market. However, it was the only Blu-ray edition of the Brett Holmes series, so I thought I'd take the leap.
With only one minor complaint (hence my 4 star rating rather than 5) I have been delighted with this edition. The film transfers are of excellent quality and clarity. I have now watched the first two discs in their entirety and hope that the remaining 8 will prove equally excellent.
The audio tracks are only Spanish and English. My above-noted minor complaint is that there is no sub-title option for either language.",1386374400,13,646,4.776785714285714
