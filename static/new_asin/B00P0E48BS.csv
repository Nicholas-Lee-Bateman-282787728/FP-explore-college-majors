6780802,5,B00P0E48BS,"This has become a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, with film score by Bernard Herrmann. If the story is not remembered or commented on, everyone is familiar with the scene where Grant is getting attacked by a crop duster while standing in the middle of nowhere ""North by Northwest"".

Roger O. Thornhill <R.O.T> (Cary Grant), mild mannered advertising executive, raises his hand at the wrong time to send a telegram. The page boy is paging George Kaplan so Roger is mistaken for Kaplan (a shorter man with dandruff) and the fun begins. Turns out that Townsend/ Vandamm (James Mason) the bad guy  is being dogged by Kaplan so Vandamm must do away with Kaplan.

Meanwhile back at the train Roger meats a cutie Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) that is apparently set on helping him.

I will not go into details as surprise and plot twisting is part of the suspense.

Will Roger get the girl?
Will Vandamm get Roger?
What is this all about?
Who is George Kaplan?",1422057600,2,952,4.642857142857143
6780803,5,B00P0E48BS,"Released in 1959, NORTH BY NORTHWEST is and remains a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Alfred Hitchcock. Bernard Herrmann's magnificent groundbreaking score truly stands out in this film and has become legendary in many ways as so many of the images are in the film. To watch it again and enjoy like never before is to realize just how entertaining this film is and how it has stood the test of time. They really do not make them like this anymore. Cary Grant inimitably is Roger Thornhill. I like his personal book of cigarette matches monogrammed with R.O.T. The O stands for nothing so he tells Eva Marie Saint on the dinning car of the 20th Century Limited. You know, I have been drinking Gibsons ever since Cary Grant ordered one in that scene. Just one of the libations you pick up watching this endearing film.",1421712000,2,819,4.616438356164384
6780804,4,B00P0E48BS,"North by Northwest, 1958 film

The film starts in late 1950s Manhattan, showing an ""advertising executive"" Roger Thornhill who is skilled in lying to the public as part of his employment by corporations. Roger attends a meeting, calls for a pageboy, and winds up being abducted in plain view of the public! (Danger in public is a common theme in thrillers, as is mistaken identification.) Roger cannot tell his captors what they want to hear (even if they used torture), so they fill him with bourbon and take him for a ride. This provides an entertaining interlude until Roger stops for the police and is arrested by Sgt. Emil Klinger. The Judge orders an investigation, but they find nothing amiss at the borrowed estate. [No check with the local police?] Roger discovers that no one has actually seen George Kaplan. The abductors show up at the hotel, but Roger escapes one again. [No back-up?] When Roger meets Lester Townsend at the UN, a knife silences Townsend permanently, and Roger is blamed for it.

The ""Professor"" discusses this at the Agency in Washington, where we learn what is really going on - decoy spy. Roger must become his own detective to solve this mystery. The film shows travel on the famous New York Central railroad to Chicago, a bit of history long gone. Roger meets a woman, Eve Kendall, who helps and befriends him. [Was this a theme in the old E. Philip Oppenheim stories?] But we soon learn she is working for Van Dam! Roger arrives in Chicago, then travels to a spot in a flat prairie, and waits. Could there be any danger in the wide open spaces? A crop duster appears to answer this question; there seems to be no escape. The plane crashes (!) and Roger escapes once again. [Wily Coyote could take lessons from him.]

Roger meets Eve but is told to go away and never return. There is something mysterious about Eve. Note how Hitchcock was able to create suspense and tension from ordinary life. Roger follows Eve, meets Van Dam and his flunky Leonard, but escapes again. Now the ""Professor"" meets Roger and takes him to Rapid City SD. There is yet another meeting with Van Dam, Leonard, and Eve. Eve shoots Roger, who is carried away by the ""Professor"". More events follow as the details of the spy ring are brought out. Eve and Roger make a getaway by climbing down the sculptures of Mount Rushmore. They escape from their pursuers who are caught by the authorities. And so the film has a happy ending, if forced.

This was a top film in its day, but now it seems terribly out of date. Films such as ""From Russia With Love"" or ""Goldfinger"" are better and less dated than what was Hitchcock's best film. Roger complains against the ""Professor"" for sacrificing people like pawns, although we learned more in future years. [The ""Professor"" was a fictionalized version of Allen Dulles, some say.] This film is an updated version of ""The Thirty-Nine Steps"".

One of the problems in this film is the crop-duster plane. It would be more probable to send out a car with two men to take Roger for a ride, but less spectacular. This comment also applies to the helicopter in ""From Russia With Love"". Do they copy each other's mistakes?",1421452800,,3161,4.647584973166368

8686007,5,B00P0E48BS,"NORTH BY NORTHWEST is by far my favorite Hitchcock thriller. It's a genuine nail biter throughout, with several excellent action sequences, a wonderful cast, superb story and a climax that remains 50 years later one of the greatest of all time! This film belongs in all home video libraries.
