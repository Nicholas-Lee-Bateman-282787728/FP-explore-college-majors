1536414,5,B00005JNH6,I was just saying that I wish I could go back and watch this from the beginning. I know it would take a long time to watch them all but I'd love to have the DVDs of all seasons anyway.  lol  I know...I guess I am nuts!,1230595200,8,218,3.617021276595745
1536415,5,B00005JNH6,"I would love to see the early days of ""Y&R"" on DVD.  Episodes of the early days of the Foster and Brooks families.  I'd love to see Snapper, Greg, Jill, Laurie, Peggy, Chris, Leslie and all the other characters.  Bring it on!",1206662400,34,225,4.309523809523809
1536416,5,B00005JNH6,"Yes how could we forget Brenda Dickson(as the original sexy and conniving Jill Abbott),she was very popular and one of the reasons I watched the show in the early 80's and have ever since. I would love to see episodes on dvd especially earlier ones I missed and for the memories. The best years were 1980-1987,although a lot of really great stuff has happened since. I have both Y&R books but a dvd of best moments or full episodes would be better.",1183507200,30,448,4.475609756097561
1536417,5,B00005JNH6,A wonderful idea. This soap opera is the classiest in the world. Love to see episodes from the 1970's and the 80's. Anyone remember Brenda Dickson as the vampish Jill Abbott? what entertainment. Great acting and a classy feel to this show and it's cutting edge on relevant social issues combined with exciting stories makes this compelling viewing. It deserves a dvd release now!,1180137600,32,379,4.9375
7940967,1,B00005JNH6,"We are avid watchers. But Seriously!
The commercials have continued to increase.
Just watched 34 minutes of Y & R and 26 minutes of commercials. Thinking about throwing in the towel!",1525305600,,182,4.903225806451613
7940968,5,B00005JNH6,I've been waiting so long for a full set of DVD's to come out for Y&R.  From the Beginning Please!  I was a teenager and watched from the beginning.  I still watch every day.,1350950400,,174,4.0588235294117645
7940969,5,B00005JNH6,"I would really enjoying having ""The Young And The Restless"" on DVD. I mean every single episode. I hope one day we can see ""The Young And The Restless"" from the beginning. I was born in 1981 so I didn't get a chance to see how it all began. This is on my DVD wish list.",1345680000,,269,3.8214285714285716
7940970,4,B00005JNH6,"I'm 27 now, as I remember I came on-board with the show as early as 11 years old... with only seeing the beginning and end credits... around 1996. As it is, I only have one episode from CBS around the summertime from that year... which aired around April 2003 again. Later, again from CBS, I recorded the Christmas of 1995, around Christmas Eve of 2007. Love these years, and would love to see most of them entirely, as I don't remember hardly anything past 5-6 years ago (no exaggeration) overall... and I would love to see the battles between Jill & Katherine, John, Jack & Victor, and recall the good times overall, including Sharon & Nick, and ofcourse, catch up with Nikki over the year! Only got on-board with current episodes starting in late 2002, until about 2006/2007 era... by then, it wasn't worth following anymore. Would love to see the 90s episodes come to DVD, way before the kids and the next generation dominated the storylines... supposedly, the 3rd generations are dominating the storylines as of 2009/2010 or so. Moreover, I don't watch this show anymore, because it is a flop waiting to be canceled anymore; excellent idea bringing this show to DVD, after the show's estimated cancellation date around 2013 (I read prior).

7940971,4,B00005JNH6,i would like to see some episodes of young cassie when she found out that sharon was her mom wouldnt you,1336694400,,104,4.0
7940972,5,B00005JNH6,I have watched this series from the beginning. I would LOVE to relive those early shows! What a trip down memory lane. Please let me know when this is available.,1324771200,5,161,4.4
7940973,5,B00005JNH6,"i would love to see Y&R put on DVD...there has been so much I have missed in different eras of my life, I would love to go back and see it all again from the beginning. There are songs that played to different love scenes that I can hear the tune in my head, but for the life of me cannot remember the name of the songs...would love to get a chance to re live all that from my teen age years.",1312588800,4,392,3.792682926829268
7940974,5,B00005JNH6,I would love LOVE LOVE to see all the episodes from the very beginning!!  I didn't start watching until the 90's and then real life got in the way and I missed years in the new millenium.  I need to be able to go back and see what has happened and who's who.  PLEASE release them on DVD!!!  I like the idea of a box set starting with the first season then a new set every 3 to 6 months.  This is a great idea!,1287014400,11,409,3.764705882352941
7940975,5,B00005JNH6,i feel that every soap should be put on dvd sooner or later i mean why not start with a boxed dvd set of the first season of the young and the restless and if it is markable which i know it will be release a new boxed set every 3 to 6 months i think that would be great and they need to do it. Stop wasting all this time and make tv on dvd i mean can you imagine how many people would purchase it. I'm in my 20s and i would love to see the young and the restless how it started out and what i missed before i was born. so please please the powers that be think about it i think it will be the best move the soap companies could ever make. and try to release bold and the beautiful and capitol and generations and passions and the city and now with guiding light gone that to.,1271203200,9,775,3.7607361963190185
7940976,5,B00005JNH6,"What a great idea, Y&R circa 1970s, on DVD. Y&R used to be the subject of DJ talk in the 70s. Everyone wanted to know what would happen next. It was fresh and exciting, the characters were young and attractive.
Can anyone forget the days of Victor going to watch Nikki strip at the Bayou.
How about the talented Cash, her male counterpart. Even the death scene with Mrs. C. holding vigil, was tasteful and believable.
Who could forget the bad boy we loved to hate, Jack Abbott as played by Terry Lester.
Victor and Douglas added class and more to the series. The writers wrote scrips  true to the characters in those days. We loved the sexy cowboy Victor, even when he was keeping his wife's lover prisoner in the wine cellar.
The writing and characters were never better.",1264464000,4,772,4.514285714285714
