7839751,5,6303168515,"Steven Spielberg, perhaps the most famous and richest director the world has never known, didn't get that way by making art films. He will never be mistaken for Akira Kurasawa and even Stanley Kubrick. These people were not disturbed by how their films did at the box office. Spielberg, just before 'Schindler's List' arrived in theatres, didn't care if it didn't make a dime. It was a movie he needed to make, and indeed he did make it. 'Schindler's List' is a flawed masterpiece. But how many movies can you think of that aren't slightly flawed? I can perhaps name a few, but I won't. John Williams didn't duplicate his 'Star Wars' theme here. His score was appropriate. The scene involving Schindler (Liam Neeson) weeping because he feels he could've given more to the Jewish cause. Perhaps this was a little overdone. The ending, when many of the Holocaust survivors (not actors) lined up to place a rock on Schindler's resting place. Some critics have found fault with that scene. But let's not get over-critical. The picture as a whole was brilliant. Probably Spielberg's best film ever. The man is so talented, audiences and critics EXPECT excellence from him. ... So when Spielberg made 'Schindler's List', there was no way he expected it to bring in the kind of money Jurassic Park made. But 'Schindler's List', standing on its own, with all of its' brilliant moments, turns out to be a true masterpiece. I don't care if the German people did come across as very one-sided. I know that about Spielberg. He emphasizes the heroes, and down-plays the bad guys (Spielberg's Nazi's, aside from Ralph Feinne's character) lacked strong character. My only concern is that a film should be well-balanced....The passion behind filmmaking, songwriting, writing books, making speeches, or just doing something nice for somebody - that passion must come from within. 'Schindler's List' came from one man's passion. I dare you to make something just as passionate, just as heartfelt as 'Schindler's List.' Hat's off to this dynamic director.",1047427200,3,2036,4.991176470588235
7839752,5,6303168515,"I had a sense that Spielberg just made movies with big budgets and wrote him off as a big-budget director. After seeing this film I realized how good of a director Spielberg is. The finest attribute I can give above all  others is his ability to tell stories in the clearest possible manner  without any confusion. In Schindlers List, Spielberg demonstrates this so  well intergrating the lives of Jewish Holocaust victims, Nazi soldiers, the  time periods, the details of the buildings and signs. The most minute  detail paid attention to. Neeson gives the performance of his career (I  believed he should have gotten it instead of Hanks). The story of one Oskar  Schindler, a Nazi, who saves 1000 Jews. Shot in a moody grainy black and  white with John Williams and famous violinist Itzak Perlman composing a  masterful moving score. This film is highly reccomended to anyone, although  it is very graphic and intense at many times. Yet this violence does not in  the least take away from the picture as a whole; only making the message  louder. Certainly Spielberg has outdone himself in everyway and deserves to  be in the ranks of some of the finest directors in history.  This special  edition of the film includes the Widescreen edition, as well as a limited  print CD of the score. It also includes Thomas Keneely's novel of the same  title, and a picture book with a few nice words by Spielberg. For the  price, its not entirely worth it, unless you collect boxed sets or a huge  Spielberg fan, otherwise the regular edition of the film will do.",945475200,,1554,4.731343283582089
7839753,5,6303168515,"The first 20 minutes are spellbinding, the rest riveting.  I've never seen a more compelling movie nor plausible explanation on why and how 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazi Germany (and Poland and Austria).  Neeson and  Kingsley provide masterful performances with Fiennes as the ultimate evil  Nazi, but no stereotype.  I've now seen the movie more than 50 times and  never fail to be moved by the ending.",944438400,,412,4.814285714285714
