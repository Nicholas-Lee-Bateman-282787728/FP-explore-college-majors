2035539,3,B0001WTW9C,"As far as price goes, this DVD collection is a good deal--3 discs for about $20.

But you do get what you pay for--the documentary itself lacks coherence, it feels rushed.  They pack in many highlights, perhaps too many.  Performances are not shown in their entirety, which is important when it comes to more artistic sports like figure skating and gymnastics.

There is one glaring ommission from this collection--the 1996 Women's Gymnastics Team (aka the ""Magnificent Seven"") is not included, nor is Shannon Miller (the most decorated US gymnast who finally won her golds in 1996) or Kerri Strug.  It's a shame, really.

I do recommend this DVD, but more of an introduction or overview.  It is not a definitive Olympic collection by any stretch.",1094947200,71,747,4.928

2035561,5,B0001WTW9C,"I love this dvd. It was better than what I had expected. This is the best Olympic dvd that I have ordered thus far. I recommend this 3 set of dvd's for anyone that loves track and field, etc. It's nice to see the men and women that were before us enjoying themselves in what they do best. I felt good for them when they were happy, and i don't even know them. It didn't matter who they were. It must be a beautiful feeling to be on that podium. Especially when you win the gold. I can't imagine. Worth buying!)",1384819200,3,510,4.0594059405940595
2035562,5,B0001WTW9C,I just loved the stories captured in this series.  There is so much inspiration to be gained by watching them.  This DVD is beautifully made and with excellent commentary. You get the share the joy and heartaches of those who are striving to be the very best that they can be.  And I really like the way that extraordinary human achievements are celebrated without favouring any particular nation.,1379030400,,397,4.8088235294117645
2035563,1,B0001WTW9C,"These DVDs were just a waste of money.  I'm a big fan of filmmaker Bud Greenspan and his documentaries on the Olympic Games.  When I purchased this product, I believed I was getting DVDs of Greenspan's work.  In fact, I found these DVDs on Amazon by typing in Bud Greenspan's name on the search line.  Clearly, he had absolutely nothing to do with this product.  I feel like I was duped and wasted by money.  I'm very disappointed with Amazon for leading me to believe Bud Greenspan had anything to do with this product.  Shame on Amazon for its quality control.  Come on, guys.  Stop spending so much time and effort hawking the Kindle and focus a little more on providing other product information your loyal customers can rely on.",1292630400,8,733,4.576923076923077
2035564,1,B0001WTW9C,"This is a slapped together collection of event footage that has no accompanying coherent or interesting or informative narrative along with it. Really sloppy and uncaring assembly here. You could care less about what is on the screen.

I cut my teeth on the truly excellent Bud Greenspan tv series back in the seventies that made me an Olympic fan ever since. Bud carefully & lovingly crafted his stories about one competitor for each show and wove together the human story of background, desire, striving and excellence in the pursuit of victory. His series are masterworks. Watch them if you can find them.

But avoid The Olympic Series.",1261180800,4,639,4.907407407407407
2035565,5,B0001WTW9C,"OK, so these 3 disks don't cover every single event in the history of the Olympics.  If they did, no one would have time to watch them.  And it may not include every event that some viewers think should be there, but it's still excellent.  Not all of the US vs. USSR hockey game is there, but it is the finale most will want to see, and it is there.

I really liked the wide selection of material, some that I remembered, some I'd never seen, and some that I'd somehow forgotten. Anyone with the mildest interest in Olympic athletics should be thrilled with this set.",1195171200,6,567,4.320754716981132
2035566,5,B0001WTW9C,"I am mostly a track enthusiast, so can hardly comment on the ice Olympic events. This DVD is over 6 hours long, containing many of the outstanding performances, including Jesse Owens, Bob Beamon's magnificent world record breaking by nearly 2 feet in the long jump at in 1968 in Mexico (Beamon broke down into a seizure, not believing what he had just done...the delay in the result was because the length of his leap was beyond the measure of the equipment), Boxing's Teofilo Stevens of Cuba, winning gold 3 times consecutively at the superheavyweight, Uganda's John Akii-Bua (RIP) becoming the first to run under 48 seconds at the 400 meter hurdles, Lee Evans in 1968 becoming the first man under 44 seconds in the 400 meters (the black power salutes by Tommy Smith and John Carlos are not left out), Cuba's Alberto Juantorena becoming the first Cuban track gold medallist when he won in (and first man ever with golds at both Olympic events)both the 400 and 800 meters run. The list goes on and on. These are brief defining and emotional moments that include many other gold performances by such greats as Kip Keino at 1500, Abebe Bikila in the marathon, Florence Griffith Joyner, Jackie Joyner Kersee, Herb Elliot, Sebastian Coe, Edwin Moses, Haile Gebresellasie, Al Oerter (RIP) winning 4 consecutive golds at the discus, etc. This DVD is constructed to display significant wins of the games, and any viewer will likely wonder why some of the highlights are ommitted. Yet, the DVD captures many amazing moments of the Olympics, well worth more than the approximately $10 i bought the DVD. Notably, Michael Johnson who holds both the 400 and 200 meter records is missing in the highlights (though images of him are displayed in the openings). In 1996, Johnson won the 200 meters in a record that may hold for many decades to come...19.32 seconds (if I am not mistaken). Johnson, an alumnus of Baylor University in Texas, has also run the most sub-44 seconds 400 meter runs. I will alwasy treasure this limited edition DVD",1191715200,25,2025,4.82183908045977
2035567,4,B0001WTW9C,"Two key elements make this collection pertinent for goal-setters, the storyline and the challenge of overcoming obstacles. Well-edited and written, this 3 DVD set covers nearly a century of Olympic competition. The various achievements are put into a context in such a way that if you are not familiar with the event and competitors involved, you can figure out what is happening because the narrator explains to you the background before telling you the outcome.

Both individual athletes and teams are highlighted in this collection of human accomplishment. Oksana Baiul's story was one of the most touching. To hear of the odds she had to overcome to reach her goal causes one to realize others have encountered terrific challenges and made it. In that sense, the story is about more than sports. Sports is an analogy with implications for other arenas.

Going back to 1920, this documentary set captures the flavor of the various modern games. Not only eras and locations, but a wide range of Olympic events are included. Many inspiring stories are found in this 3 set collection.",1174953600,12,1084,5.016666666666667
2035568,5,B0001WTW9C,"If you love sport then you will love this history run of the greatest moments in Olympic history. This 3 disc with over 6 hours of highlights is full of champions and heroes of the Olympic Games. Watching this DVD makes

you feel and see what the human spirit can achieve when it needs too. I love sport and competition and found this DVD inspiring. Certainly worth the price and quality and quantity were not spared. What more can I say I loved it and feel sport lovers will also.",1174953600,6,481,4.344444444444444
2035569,4,B0001WTW9C,This dvd was needed for a large presentation and was received the day of the event. The dvd was just what we were looking for.,1143072000,5,126,4.08
8017308,2,B0001WTW9C,"What a missed opportunity! Great for 1920 to 1950 skating history, odd Nancy Kerrigan and Scott Hamilton commentary with brief mentions of their time in the last 10 mins. Dick Button is a national treasure & he was underused in the special. Also the memorabilia guys? We could have done without that drivel. I'm a history buff in general and almost threw it out. The director should be drawn & quartered. What were the producers thinking?
Why not a double DVD and include 1970 to 1996? Beware folks.",1524268800,,499,4.681818181818182

It's great to get over 6 hours of highlights for such an affordable price and I really appreciate the fact that it focuses on both the Winter and Summer Games and gives attention to athletes from all over the world and not just the biggest countries.,1476230400,,285,4.480769230769231
