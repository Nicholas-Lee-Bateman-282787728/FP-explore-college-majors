4296126,5,B004A8ZX28,"""Unknown"" is great! This is how the story goes: Dr. Martin Harris awakens after a car accident in Berlin to discover that his wife suddenly doesn't recognize him and another man has assumed his identity. Ignored by disbelieving authorities and hunted by mysterious assassins, he finds himself alone, tired and on the run. Aided by an unlikely ally, Martin plunges headlong into a deadly mystery that will force him to question his sanity, his identity, and just how far he's willing to go to uncover the truth.

The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Martin Harris) is great! The directing by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed ""House Of Wax"" (2005) & ""Orphan"" (2009) is great! The screenplay (based on the novel ""Out Of My Head"" by Didier Van Cauwelaert) by Oilver Butcher & Stephen Cornwell is great!

The music by John Ottman (who also did the music to ""House Of Wax"" & ""Orphan"", most recently did the music to ""The Resident"" (2011) & Alexander Rudd is great! The cinematography by Flavio Labiano (who also did the cinematography to ""Bones"" (2001) is great! The film editing by Tim Alverson (who also did the film editing to ""The Astronaut's Wife"" (1999), ""Darkness Falls"" (2003) & ""Orphan"") is great! The casting by Lucinda Syson (who also, recently did the casting to ""Kick-Ass"" (2010), ""Clash Of The Titans"" (2010) & the upcoming ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011) is great! The production design by Richard Bridgland (who also did the production design to ""Resident Evil"" (2002, also did the costume design), ""AVP: Alien Vs. Predator"" (2004), ""RocknRolla"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Priest"" (2011) & ""Fright Night"" (2011) is great! The art direction by Stephen Dobric (who also did the art direction to ""Ever After"" (1998), ""Troy"" (2004) & ""AVP: Alien Vs. Predator""), Anja Muller (who also did the art direction to ""The White Ribbon"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters"" (2012), Andreas Olshausen (who also did the art direction to ""Beyond The Sea"" (2004), ""Good"" (2008), ""The Last Station"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters"") & Cornelia Ott (who also did the art direction to ""Black Book"" (2006), ""Valkyrie"" (2008) & ""The Ghost Writer"" (2010) is great! The set decoration by Bernhard Henrich (who also did the set decoration to ""Vertical Limit"" (2000), ""The Bourne Supremacy"" (2004), ""Valkyrie"", ""The Ghost Writer"" & the upcoming ""Hansel And Gretel: Witch Hunters"") is great! The costume design by Ruth Myers (who also did the costume design to ""...And Justice For All.""

This is a great action thriller that keeps you entertained and on the edge of your seat, thinking. This is a great action movie from the production company, Dark Castle Entertainment, which is known for remaking ""House On Haunted Hill"" (1999), ""Thirteen Ghosts"" (2001) & ""House Of Wax"", they also worked on ""Orphan"" as well. This is another action hit from Liam Neeson that is definitely a perfect match to ""Taken"" (2009).",1298160000,4,3338,5.09872029250457
4296127,3,B004A8ZX28,"Plot ovrview:
Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) and his wife are going to a convention thing in Berlin, and while they are about to go check into their hotel, Harris realizes he left his briefcase in the airport. He waves down a taxi and is on his way back to the airport when a refrigerator falls off of a truck and causes them (Martin and the taxi driver) to drive of a bridge. Four days later, Harris wakes up in the hospital to find that his place has been taken by another man.

What i wanna say:
Hitchcockian, the word used by Brian Reaves in his review, is such an appropriate word to describe this movie. When I watched ""Unknown,"" I couldn't stop comparing it to Hitchcock's movie, North by Northwest, and The Bourne Trilogy. I guess it's appropriate to compare it to ""Taken"" because it was the last big movie Neeson was in, but the only thing besides Neeson that those movies have in common is the level of understanding the audience has with the characters. Both of them are shallow and they just take an insensitive approach toward killing people.

The movie is entertaining with the car chasing and the fast-action fighting scenes, but they would be a lot better if they had a plot or some character depth to stand on.  It doesn't take a lot of thinking to understand what's going on, but this can be ignored like many bad qualities in any movie nameable. The deepest emotion I felt for any of the characters was best expressed by saying things like, ""Gee, I sure hope they don't die,"" and, ""golly I would hate to have that happen to me."" There are many nameless characters. I only remember two people's names from the movie, and those aren't even their real names. Neeson's performance is alright. His growly dog voice is getting better each movie I see him in. He still hasn't gotten the American accent down perfectly (but I think his Irish accent is way better anyway). One misleading thing: You may notice that Neeson is holding a gun on the cover; he doesn't use a gun the entire movie.

Rating: three out of five stars. And to all of you who have seen the move, I would like to say, ""Goodbye, I'm going to go take a shower now.""",1298160000,,2141,4.440203562340967
4296128,4,B004A8ZX28,"Unknown may be marketed as a sequel of sorts (at least in tone) to Liam Neeson's surprise hit of a few years back, but this is not the action packed thrill ride that Taken provided. This film is about 75% mystery/thriller and 25% action. In fact, there were only a couple of fight scenes and one neat car chase to fill in the gaps when the pace needed picking up. I agree with the other reviewer here who said they wished the twist came earlier and left more time for Neeson to kick some serious booty. Speaking of the twist, I couldn't figure it out and I felt it worked really well.

Liam Neeson once again proves to be an unlikely yet very believable action star. You can't help but root for this guy. I hope he continues with these types of roles every so often. January Jones and Diane Kruger are here to look good, but only Kruger has a character worth any interest. There is a quiet scene with Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz that stands out.

Taken or Unknown? Which one do I think is better? I'll take the action in Taken any day of the week, but I feel this movie has a stronger cast and a more interesting story. Too bad they couldn't throw just a little more Qui-Gon beatdowns into the mix. Still, this is a wild ride worth at least a rental, or maybe even a nice spot next to your copy of Taken.",1298073600,181,1306,4.199203187250996
4296129,4,B004A8ZX28,"A fairly common theme in fictionland centers around amnesia. A character is injured (head injury) and wakes up with a fuzzy memory and little awareness of self.

Well, this film develops that theme. It begins with a renowned American botanist, Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson), flying into Berlin with his adoring, stunningly beautiful wife Elizabeth (January Jones). After leaving the airport, the couple is just outside a luxury hotel when Harris realizes that he is missing a briefcase, which must be very important.  He finds himself momentarily separated from his wife, seconds count, and the briefcase is most likely at the airport. So, Harris jumps into a taxi (conveniently) driven by a beautiful, resourceful, tough, compassionate, illegal immigrant, Gina (Diane Kruger).  Almost immediately, things go very awry.

The plot is somewhat confusing. I don't want to reveal anything, but most likely you will develop ""selective amnesia"" regarding the plot anyway. That is, you will forget it not long after the credits roll. What will ""stick"" are great shots of a wintry Berlin, a spectacular car chase, the sinister deeds of sinister folks, and another powerful performance by Liam Neeson. It seems to me that Neeson has the role of tough-guy-against-the-world nailed.",1298073600,5,1273,5.318407960199005
4296130,3,B004A8ZX28,"First of all, ""Unknown"" is a good movie. Fifteen years ago, Harrison Ford could have seamlessly shifted into this role and done a good job with it. That is probably the biggest fault in this film: the character doesn't seem like Liam until the very end. After the huge success of ""Taken"" (just about any guy you talk to will tell you it's in their list of favorite films), he had set himself up as this brooding action character. More subdued yet brutal than Jason Statham, he could have easily stepped into any action role at this point as the quiet killer and made the movie his. Unfortunately, in this film he is not playing the trained killer so much as the helpless victim trying to get his life back.

Don't get me wrong, after the plot twist at the end of the film, it gets really good and reminds you why you came to see the film. The problem is getting to that point. If the plot twist had occurred an hour into the movie to give you 45 minutes of Liam being cool, I could have enjoyed it more. Likewise, a character actor like Harrison Ford (in his day) could have made this a good film. Instead, I kept waiting for Liam to break some bad guy's bones like ""Taken"", and it was just a very long time coming. I found myself looking at my watch several times into the film.

It's not really the movie goer's fault for expecting this action. The trailers for the film make it look like a follow-up to ""Taken"" (or at least in the same action vein) and even the movie poster gives us a gun-toting Liam looking ready to kill...and instead we get this Hitchcockian thriller with a little action at the end. Marketed differently, this movie could have done better with lower expectations. Pushing it off as an action thriller isn't fair to it.",1298073600,2,1743,4.3765432098765435
4296131,3,B004A8ZX28,"THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS IN THE LAST TWO PARAGRAPHS

I'm just going to say what everyone is probably thinking, Unknown looks like the indirect sequel to Taken. While this isn't necessarily a bad thing on paper, it is kind of unnecessary given that a Taken sequel is currently in development. While Liam Neeson used to be the go to actor to portray a mentor or father figure that would die early on in whatever film he was a part of (Star Wars: Episode I, Gangs of New York, Kingdom of Heaven, Batman Begins, and The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, just to name a few), Taken seemed to break that mold. But now it seems like Neeson is drawn to roles similar to the one he had in Taken since the film was such a surprise success. At the end of the day, however, Unknown is definitely its own film with obvious similarities to Taken.

The biggest difference between Taken and Unknown is that element of mystery in Unknown. For the first three quarters of the film, you're trying to figure out who the real Dr. Martin Harris really is. And when it's finally revealed, it's actually a surprisingly decent twist. Taken also had much more action than Unknown mostly in part to Liam Neeson completely owning anyone that stood in his way of finding his daughter. While Unknown has its exciting moments, it's more thrilling than anything. It's all mostly car chases and Martin running away from people trying to kill him. While there is a scuffle or two involving Neeson beforehand, his only real fight similar to anything in Taken is the one in the finale (the ""I didn't forget everything,"" scene). While this may sound disappointing, it's really not and gives Unknown a few more distinguishing features to seem less like a doppelganger of a film you've already seen.

The cast is pretty strong all around. Liam Neeson doesn't disappoint and is just as strong as he was in Taken. Diane Kruger manages to outshine January Jones, but that's mostly due to Kruger having more screen time and doing more besides saying she doesn't know her husband. Frank Langella is worth talking about though. Ever since Frost/Nixon, Langella seems to have stuck to smaller roles (where he also usually winds up dying). It's just a shame since Langella usually steals scenes in whatever film he's a part of and you generally want his character to be around longer than he is. On the bright side though, at least he doesn't take it upon himself to choose characters that you wouldn't want around at all.

Unknown isn't what it could it have been though. Despite its flaws, it was actually incredibly entertaining and extremely exciting up until the last fifteen minutes or so. Then it's like they decided to throw logic out the window. THESE ARE SOME VERY HEAVY SPOILERS THAT LIE AHEAD, SO IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ENTIRE FILM SPOILED I SUGGEST YOU STOP READING HERE. The original twist is fairly original; Martin is actually an assassin that was sent to Berlin on a mission, hit his head in the car crash, and wound up believing he was the fake identity he took on for the job. That's fine, but when he decides to grow a conscience and save the day is when it seems kinda hokey. Considering the payoff for the whole thing is fast growing corn, the film winds up coming off like a bad joke rather than an exhilarating two hours. Also, it can't really be that easy to obtain passports, can it?

Unknown starts off as a pretty intense thriller with teeth grinding car chases and knucklebiting action sequences across rooftops and parking lots, but all of the good things Unknown has going for it are thrown away during its final minutes. Instead we're going to give a bleeding heart to a guy who originally started as a villain and end the world's hunger problems in a two minute video montage. Unknown may look like an action packed film you've seen before, but it actually isn't anywhere near as good as Taken is. If you liked Taken, Unknown is still worth giving a shot. Just don't be surprised if you walk away disappointed.",1297987200,4,4009,4.609243697478991

4296218,4,B004A8ZX28,"How great of an actor is Irishman Liam Neeson? He has real range, as has been proven in his more dramatic roles, but let's face it, even at the age he is now, he is a total badass. Watch the first (and only decent) Taken, but also for the more subtle type of badass, watch The Grey, which was not great, but he was great in it. This surprisingly good Euro-produced Thriller (as Taken was) features Neeson as a doctor who, upon arriving in Berlin, is involved in a car accident. The first of many twists is that, rather than using the trope of memory loss, Neeson apparently knows exactly who he is, but no one -- including his wife, played ably by January Jones -- believes him. This ""threat"" (to use a Shakespearean scholarly term) starts in motion a non-stop train of events that, along the way picks up the excellent Diane Kruger, the legendary Bruno Ganz and a cast of maybe good guys/gals and maybe bad girls/guys that make the whole trip very much worth it, Add to that well shot location photography in Berlin, in Winter, along with some very well executed car chases and you have a very serviceable thriller a la John Frankenheimer, Paul Greengrass or anyone else. Oh, and can I just ask, did Neeson do his own stunts in the car chases? If so, then he is the grand badass of all. Great stuff.",1518652800,4,1300,4.398340248962656

4296505,3,B004A8ZX28,"Liam Neeson has a very particular set of skills and instead of using them to save his family, this time he's using them to save himself. Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson) has gone to Berlin, with his wife, for a medical conference, when an accident has left him in a coma. Upon awaking, no one knows who he is, not even his wife, but worse than that, there is another person walking around claiming to be Martin Harris. I don't know about you, but after three Taken movies and a handful of similar film, all starring Liam Neeson, playing the same type of character in the same type of situations, I've gotten pretty tired of him and his particular set of skills. At least the Taken movies moved at a reasonable pace and had more than a narrow focus, the same can't be said for Unknown. Parts of this film are as slow as can be, featuring Neeson and company sitting around talking about what could be going on and what to do before they show them doing it. They story is also so narrowly focused, that it leaves little flexibility for anything else. This film is as serious as it gets, it is a hundred percent focused on the story at all times, and Liam Neeson is as dry as the banks of the Colorado River. The chase scenes were cool, the conspiracy around everything was well written, but all in all this film feels very long and moves way too slowly for an action thriller, not to mention, I think I speak for everyone when I say we've had more than enough of Liam Neeson in these type of films.",1476316800,,1489,4.302491103202847

I am giving it only three stars, and I am being generous, because of what a famous Madison Avenue literary agent would describe as a fatal flaw. That flaw is the lack of logic related to the major element in the story  the hero trying to prove that he was misrepresented by an impostor. All he needed to do was to either go to the American Embassy and get its support or to have the institution he represented confirm that he was the real McCoy.",1472256000,,612,4.142857142857143

4296581,3,B004A8ZX28,"Oh yes, this is an adventure film and succeeds pretty well on that score, but if you have critical thinking skills this film is also a stinker.

At the core of the plot is the premise that a scientist, described by Neeson's character as a ""progressive"", has developed, with the financial backing of an Arab sheik (also characterized by Neeson as ""progressive""), a strain of corn capable of ending world hunger. He intends to offer it to the world for free, but greedy capitalists want to steal the science and make billions of dollars on it.

Now in real life, Neeson is a flaming liberal, so lets examine the film for ideological soundness: 1) How many Arab oil billionaires do you ever hear of that are not greedy capitalists? Anyone ever heard of OPEC, the oil cartel that over the years has tried and succeeded in manipulating the world oil market to it's advantage, bilking working people out of trillions of hard earned dollars? 2.) In light of all the recent mass murders around the globe committed by Islamic terrorists, how likely is it that an Islamic oil sheik wants to feed the world rather than burn it down? It is well documented that Saudi princes fund  education in radicalism in mosques all around the world. 3.) If greedy capitalists are so bad, then why didn't the producers of this film donate all proceed to charity, and why didn't Neeson donate his acting so the little guy consumers could get a price break at the box office?",1469664000,,1448,4.626459143968872

LMAO! Monsanto must contributed to the funding of the film because this is definitely GMO propaganda!

Once known for roles like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Michael Collins,"" Neeson has now become an action star with the ""Taken"" trilogy, ""Non-Stop"" and other films including this GEM of a movie.  What sets Neeson apart from other so-called ""action stars"" is the gravitas he brings to his roles because he is such a wonderful actor but also because he is so physically imposing.  Unlike Tom Cruise [why would they cast a 5' 6"" actor as Jack Reacher is beyond me] you really believe that Neeson's characters can take on the bad guys and win.

""Unknown"" is a terrific movie and calls for only some suspension of disbelief in my opinion because everything comes together by the end.  Yes, Neeson's character leaves his briefcase at the airport but come on people, do you want a movie or not?  Neeson plays Dr. Martin Harris who has come to Berlin with his wife Liz [played woodenly by eye candy January Jones, make that emaciated eye candy January Jones] who is the only person in the movie who was badly cast.  Forgetting the aforementioned briefcase at the airport, he gets into a cab at his hotel driven by Diane Kruger...who brings all the life January Jones left behind as an illegal Bosnian immigrant working in Germany.  They get into a car crash and Neeson wakes up in the hospital where he has been in a coma for four days.

Frantic that his wife doesn't know where he is, Harris's life turns into a Kafkaeque nightmare when he locates his wife who doesn't recognize him and worse is with another man who claims that he is Dr. Martin Harris.  For a brief moment he begins to think that maybe his head injury is worse than he thought until someone tries to assassinate him and he realizes that there is a plot afoot because if he were just some guy recovering from the aftereffects of a coma, why would someone want to kill him? OK..that's it for the spoiler alerts and actually the film has so many twists and turns to it that I haven't given that much away.

Neeson has seamlessly made the transition to action star and this movie succeeds on every level.  Who is he?  Who is the man pretending to be Dr. Martin Harris?  Why does his own wife not recognize him?  What will he do and where will he turn?  This is where Diane Kruger enters the picture and her performance is first rate.  Her ""Gina"" is smart and resourceful and saves the day more than once.

Other standouts include Bruno Ganz as Ernst Jurgen, a former Stasi agent [""I cannot drink any longer but I like to forget that. We Germans are experts at forgetting. We forgot we were Nazis. Now we have forgotten 40 years of Communism - all gone.""] who is an unlikely ally -- aren't we supposed to hate the East German counterparts of the KGB -- but Jurgen makes us like him almost against our will.  Frank Langella as Rodney Cole and Sebastian Koch as Dr Bressler also infuse their characters with special qualities.  I have been enamored with Koch since I first saw him in the Dutch film ""The Black Book"" and even in this small role, he shines.  I did not recognize Aidan Quinn during the first go around of seeing the movie.  His looks have changed a lot but once I got over the surprise of how much he has aged, I just enjoyed his usual competent performance

This is an edge-of-your-seat thriller/mystery that takes us for a ride in more ways than one meaning I hope you like car chases.  If you enjoy this type of genre the way we do, you will not be disappointed.  ""Unknown"" delivers.",1449360000,13,3486,4.503974562798092

4297956,3,B004A8ZX28,"I had seen this movie once before and forgot that I had seen it.  When I turned it on and began watching I remembered why I had forgotten it.  It had much the same premise as Alfred Hitchcock's 'Frantic' but the mystery was not as well written and although Liam Neeson is a good actor he is not in the same caliber as Harrison Ford.  The premise although not original is always good but it fell a little short and the plot was predictable.  I gave it three stars because I liked the action and the mystery did hold your attention until you figured out what was going on before the story was revealed.  The direction was good and the choreography was also very good.  It's not a waste of time, it's just not a great movie.",1424995200,4,721,4.226277372262774

4298221,4,B004A8ZX28,"We were half expecting another formulaic clich ridden, honest-man-wronged Hollywood conspiracy thriller clone. Thankfully, we were more than half wrong. Despite ticking all of the genre boxes and despite a more than passing nod towards The Long Kiss Goodnight, this film completely fails to disappoint. Neeson is, of course, brilliant, the plot twists and turns most satisfactorily and there is never a dull moment even after you've worked out what's going on. In spite of being relatively unknown, Jaume Collet-Serra directs with a firm grip on suspense worthy of Bruckheimer or Scott so the film never runs out of steam. A Taken it is not, nor is it anywhere near a Bourne, but it is nonetheless a cleverly constructed and entertaining addition to the conspiracy thriller genre.",1420934400,,780,5.149606299212598

4299030,3,B004A8ZX28,"UNKNOWN, another one of recent action star Liam Neeson's winter season offerings, is fairly entertaining, but also very implausible. Liam Neeson plays Martin Harris, a scientist who is attending a biotech conference in Berlin with his wife. Or is he? After an accident, he is left with no identification and no proof of who he is, and everyone is claiming they don't know him. He then proceeds to find out who he is. This type of mystery/thriller has been done before, although perhaps not as slickly as this one. The movie ERASED, starring Aaron Eckhart comes to mind, although that pales in comparison to this in terms of just about everything. Liam Neeson once again shows that he makes a capable, if unexpected, action star and he also has the acting chops to give it some weight. January Jones as his wife, however, is practically a non-entity. She practically sleepwalks through her limited role and doesn't really give off anything resembling human emotion, although that might have been on purpose. To accurately describe my reasoning would delve into spoiler territory, so I'll just leave it at that. Diane Kruger also gave a good performance as an immigrant taxi driver who helps out Liam Neeson's character. Aside from him, she's given the most screen time and is given a nice back story, to boot. Rounding out the cast are Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella. Although neither one of them had a lot of screen time (one might say they were underutilized), they did own the few scenes they were in. In terms of technical quality, the film was decent. There was a fair amount of handheld camerawork, but none of it was too ""shaky"" and the fight scenes were comprehensible. There was even a couple good car chases. There was also some nice on-location shooting in Berlin, although the visual palette of the film didn't really bring out anything spectacular. Narrative-wise, the film is preposterous but still fun. There was a couple of moments where I laughed out loud due to how ridiculous things were, but overall I just accepted that the whole premise was far-fetched and went with it. Now, being mostly a dumb action movie, you wouldn't expect it to have much in the way of pertinent themes or sociopolitical commentary, but they did manage to shoehorn some in via Bruno Ganz's character, a former Stasi agen,t and a Saudi prince who is bankrolling a GMO project. Nothing too deep is said, but it was nice that they acknowledged that these things exist. As a whole, the movie is ok. It moves along at a good pace and is never boring. Still, discerning moviegoers would be justified in skipping it if they don't like this brand of action movie.",1403222400,5,2649,4.760869565217392

4299127,5,B004A8ZX28,"First and foremost, the quality of the blu-ray is great.

The premise of the movie is: Liam Neeson wakes up from a coma unsure of how it happened, but remembers who he came with. The problem, she says she doesn't know him. Someone has taken his identity and he isn't sure who he is, and no one is willing to believe him.  With the help of a young woman, Neeson attempts to uncover his identity which is much more secretive than he expected.

It's a typical Neeson action movie with a great plot, and it keeps you wondering until the end of who he is and how he ended up in the coma to begin with, as well as why do the people he thought he knew not recognize him.",1397001600,,663,4.084615384615384
4299128,5,B004A8ZX28,"Another perfect role for Liam Neeson!  Keeps your interest throughout the movie. More intellectual and less action than the movie Taken was, but in my opinion just as enjoyable. I did like it better than his follow up movie to Taken. I would say if you like Liam Neeson you would like this movie.",1396828800,,296,4.481481481481482
4299129,4,B004A8ZX28,"Fresh from his exploits in Taken it was obviously a good idea to exploit Neesons newly minted tough guy persona while still fresh in the mind of the film-going public: hence Unknown, a shamelessly derivative product if ever there was one!  Perhaps I'm being a little too harsh, but I think not. Naturally, it's impossible to escape our cultural influences and we cannot look at anything without looking through the filters of our experience and here we have a perfect example.  Whether consciously or otherwise the visual echoes of previous productions flicker and sometimes beam from the screen almost blindingly throughout.

But this isn't meant to be a criticism: for the movie buff its all part of the entertainment!  We have bio-scientist, Dr Martin Harris (Neeson), arriving in a snowy, wintery Berlin accompanied by his wife (January Jones).  Almost three decades before, in Hitchcocks Torn Curtain, we had physicist, Dr Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman), arriving in Copenhagen accompanied by his fiance (Julie Andrews).  Both esteemed American scientists are visiting European capitals to give presentations at an important scientific conference.

On arriving at their hotel Harris realizes that his briefcase, containing important items like a passport and his presentation papers, has been left at the airport and, bizarrely, without telling his wife he hops back into the taxi and returns to the hotel hoping to retrieve the lost briefcase.  However, calamity strikes and the taxi is involved in an incident that causes it to swerve and hurtle through a barrier into the icy river.  Harris is knocked unconscious but the female driver, who we later come to know as Gina (Diane Kruger) is able to escape and make the surface.  She realizes Harris is still in the car and manages to dive down and save him!

He wakes up in hospital and is told hes been out for four days.  Immediately discharging himself he manages to make his way back to his hotel to find his wife who steadfastly refuses to recognize him having in the meantime mysteriously acquired another husband, Dr Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn), who has all the necessary documentation to prove that he is the real Harris and Neeson the imposter!

So which one is the real Harris? Since Neeson is the star, it must be him, surely!  But just like Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) before him in North by North West, he has a tough job persuading just about anybody!  However, hes given the name of a private detective, a former Stasi operative named Ernst Jurgen (Bruno Ganz) who acts as the wiser older mentor type figure a la, Dr Brulov (Michael Chekov) in Hitchcocks Spellbound.  Jurgen advises Harris to find the taxi driver, Gina, as he thinks she may be the key!

And, indeed, this turns out to be a valid assertion.  Gina, just like Michelle (Emanuelle Seigner) in Polanskis Frantic, who aids Harrison Fords Dr Richard Walker (a mere medical practitioner) in an unknown Paris, proves to be just the kind of streetwise, knowledgeable young sidekick Harris needs.

So, weve seen many of the elements before but the primary source seems to be Hitchcock, primarily, North by North West: even an evil though amiable and courteous Mr Big a la James Masons, Phillip Vandamm, in the form of Frank Langella, enters the action about half way through and January Jones and Diana Kruger are a kind of amalgam of Eva Marie Saints, Eve Kendall.

Fittingly, then, after suitably Machiavellian plot machinations, the film ends on a train.  It might be derivative but very entertainingly so!",1396137600,,3539,4.964406779661017

His wife Elizabeth (January Jones) does not appear to recognize him, while everyone around thinks he is stark staring mad.

Liam Neeson can act, so what's he doing in this schlock?  The last time I saw him and Aidan Quinn at odds was in ""Michael Collins,"" not the most historically reliable of movies, but a heck of a lot better than this.  Quite a bit of the movie is taken up with two car chases, and that's not counting the car ride that ends up with the taxi in the river.  OK -- it's a clever premise -- the hit man who loses his sense of who he is after an accident to the extent of forgetting he's a hit man -- and then causing all sorts of trouble for his backup.  AND, when he does finally remember who he is, he tries to do the right thing, presumably because he's appalled at the damage he has already caused (several corpses) and because he has had the good fortune to meet an honest illegal alien taxi driver (female, pretty) who has shown herself willing to help him at a time when he didn't know who he was.  Then there's suspense: will his backups manage to carry out the hit?  Oh, and there's a bomb timed to go off at a crucial moment . . .  Yes it's a mess, but it's the kind of mess that can be made only by slick action-movie makers and decent actors who feel they have to do this kind of thing.  But do they . . . really?

The plot proceeds from there, with things getting worse and worse for poor Martin, who has no idea what's happening around him.

I really enjoyed ""Unknown,"" and only when it ended realized that there were some gaping holes in the plot.  That diminishes my enjoyment retrospectively.  I like movies to make sense.

As snippets of memory return, he tries to convince everyone around him that he is Dr. Martin Harris, though another man is now accompanying his wife and claiming to be Dr. Harris.

Through some rather complex plot twists and turns, accompanied by car chases and violence, we eventually learn why another man is claiming to the Dr. Martin. I won't include any plot spoilers here, but the back story that is revealed is quite interesting, if not totally believable. Liam Neeson excels at this type of role- intense, complex and nuanced. The wrap-up was a bit far-fetched - why does he go full circle from being a bad guy to a good guy? It is never explained and rather improbable.

4299505,5,B004A8ZX28,"Possibly one of the most overused quotes from Jim Morrison is ""there are things known and things unknown and in between are the doors."" There is no easy way to sum up the film
UNKNOWN, since it is a thriller, as well as an action piece. I suspect that the book, in English translation, which UNKNOWN is adapted from, as many more answers, and probably
just as many dead ends. Just as the film THE NINTH GATE was a superbly teased out thread from the book le club Dumas, where certain characters become clear only after reading
the book. Playing with the theme of the loss of memory is an intriguing element, especially when I had received an amazingly erudite book called COMMUNITY in the same week
that I received UNKNOWN, and I could not help but draw some comparisons. When I had looked up the quote from Jim Morrison, I also found another Morrison quote that could quite
easily apply to the film unknown:"" I believe in a long, prolonged, derangement of the senses in order to obtain the unknown."" Basically at least the first third of the film
could apply to this quote. I must admit that my interest in this film was from a promo where there was no indication of the central film story. The film TAKEN is, in my view,
what some may term a rock 'em sock 'em roller coaster ride, where the identities of each character are clearly defined, and you are essentially strapped in for an amazing
roller coaster ride that few films can emulate in the exact same way. UNKNOWN requires more thought, more intellect, in the approach that the audience should take with such a
potentially involving film. I suspect that this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, as some might say, since key characters evolve, develop, and, at least from my point of
view, raise many questions about the nature of who we are, what are our memories, and so on. It seemed Langella enjoyed this role, and got into the intricacies very much. So,
suspend the analytical, at least while you watch the film, and I think you will have an unforgettable experience.",1374624000,,2032,4.539509536784741

The movie starts out innocently enough and one wonders where the adventure could come from with such a prosaic sounding story ahead. What happens is full of the unexpected and leaves the viewer wondering how in the world is the movie going to explain all that?

If you liked the Bourne movies then you will like Unknown. It's a little slower than a Bourne movie, but it's similar in the mystery aspect of trying to figure out what's going on with the Liam Neeson character. It's like Jason Bourne in his fifties. Soon there might be Grandpa Bourne, ""When I was younger I couldn't remember who I was,"" ""Grandpa Bourne, you can't remember who you are now.""

When he recovers he finds that someone else has stolen his identity (and his wife!) and is attending the conference in his place.

What I didn't like was that almost all the flashback scenes are ""steamy"". Really? That's all the character can or would flashback to? Those are the most important ""memories"" ??

4299804,2,B004A8ZX28,"I regret renting this movie.  I enjoyed ""Taken"" and believed the reviews that said this movie was like that.  I wondered why I never heard of ""Unknown"" before...but after watching it I know why...it's a bad movie.  I actually had a hard time figuring out what was going on for most of the film, but that's not because it was some great mystery.  This reminds me of a bad NYU student film.  Or, since it was shot in Berlin, maybe it was a European university and the student filmmaker was Liam's niece or nephew and he starred in this as a favor.

This movie reminds me of the old days when there were video stores and I'd get tricked into watching a movie because of the box cover art.  Everything about this was designed to appeal to someone who liked ""Taken""...only the story is nothing like ""Taken"".

Amnesia is involved in the plot.  The main character is someone else besides who he thinks he is.  There is a twist towards the end that would make M. Night Shyamalan cringe.  Maybe he wrote this movie under a pen name, come to think of it.

I actually think I've found a way to tell if a movie is any good besides the ""If it has a big star in it but you've never heard of it then it's bad"" canard. In this case, ""Unknown"" was priced as a $2.99 rental on Amazon Instant Video but I could have bought the movie in digital form for $5.99.  Typically, movies rent for $3.99 and you can purchase them for $9.99 here on Amazon Instant Video.  I wondered why it was so cheap to just buy it and I thought about spending the extra $3 and just doing that (which would have been a great deal if I ever wanted to see this movie even one more time in the future).  Next time I see something priced like this I am going to take it as a warning sign that the movie is one that not a lot of people are interested in buying...or the price would be higher.",1356652800,,1843,4.166666666666667

Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

4299921,4,B004A8ZX28,"Liam Neeson seems to be following Michael Caine's mid-career trajectory; a tall, able actor with great screen presence takes any script - good, bad, and indifferent - in order to work regularly.  In ""Unknown,"" Neeson plays a mild-mannered doctor and devoted husband who faces a shocking identity crisis while visiting Berlin.  Many viewers have drawn parallels between this film and 2008's Neeson action film ""Taken;"" thankfully, this film seems quite different, and much better.

Though both ""Taken"" and ""Unknown"" are action/suspense films, Neeson's character in the latter film spends most of the story as a highly-vulnerable ""everyman.""  His plight - thrown into a strange, cold city in which no one recognizes him - could be taken from a thousand dreams (or at least a hundred Phillip K. Dick short stories).  The premise is so commonplace that the plot could have been derivative and tedious, but it holds and maintains tension quite well.  It also taps into common wish-fulfillment; we all would like to be more than meets the eye.  As one character says: ""It's all about the details.""  And so it is; those details give this film flavor and heft.

The supporting cast lend the film much of its interest.  Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz are superb here.  Berlin itself has a great supporting role; it's chilling in its distinctive ""Berlin Blue"" which many directors and cinematographers have labored to perfect.

""Unknown"" has its flaws; I automatically deduct a star from almost any film with a car chase.  If it's not ""The French Connection"" or ""Bullitt,"" it's filler.  The chase is blessedly brief.  The actress portraying the doctor's wife is also a liability, but the film survives these flaws.

4299963,2,B004A8ZX28,"There are a lot of reviews talking about the plot, so I won't go into them, I'll just talk about why I thought the movie was disappointing.

There are a lot of reasons to watch a movie - it might have your favorite actors, or be cinematically beautiful, or have great music, or be sexually stimulating, or it might have a fascinating story line.

None of these pertain to this movie.

Liam Neelsen is a good action-figure, that's true, but there were so many plot holes that I just had to give up and say ""This is a lame Hollywood movie written for people who are just graduating from Saturday morning cartoons"", to keep from getting too irritated.

In my opinion, the only thing that saved it was the final ending, when we found out who was calling the shots.  They should have taken fifteen seconds from some of the chase scenes and put it more into going in depth with the motivations of the people setting the whole thing up.

I don't want to be a spoiler here, but anyone who says these things don't happen should research Royal Rife, Wilhelm Reich, The Adventures of other Free Energy Activists at <...>, or ""Dead Scientists and Microbiologists"" at <...>, or just do some searches on strange deaths.",1329609600,3,1205,4.529953917050691
4299964,3,B004A8ZX28,"I enjoyed Unkown until the end.  I even enjoyed it close to the end when the truth about Neeson's character (Dr. Martin Harris, in Berlin for a biotechnology conference) comes out, up until the rationale and justification for all this sturm and drang occurs.  Then I got disgusted with the Hollywood agenda.  But more on that at the end of THIS review.

Dr. Martin Harris, in Berlin with his wife, is in an auto accident in a taxi, nearly dies, and comes out of a coma.  At that point he's ""unknown.""  His wife doesn't know him any more and she's with another guy who is Dr. Martin Harris (played by Aiden Quinn), who has all the proper papers!  Neeson's character has absolutely zero papers to prove he is really Dr. Harris.  He then starts running all over Berlin trying to figure out who he is and avoid getting killed by some shady ruthless guys.  The plot is full of suspense and fear.  I like the ""Urban Euro feel"" to the movie when Harris, played well by Neeson, befriends Gina the taxi driver (who is an illegal immigrant from Eastern Europe) and runs all over Berlin trying to figure things out and avoiding the bad guys.  He runs into a former member of the Stasi (E. German secret police), which only makes the confusion worse and the action more lethal.  While some may find the movie plot cliched, I liked it and I was rather surprised when I learned the truth near the end, when Dr. Martin Harris finds out who he really is.

(Spoiler alert below!)
OK, now my rant and the part that I hate:  THE CLICHED HOLLYWOOD POLITICAL AGENDA, which comes out at the end.  It's in way, way too many movies!  You see, corporations are evil, because they are greedy sociopathic money makers and they'll kill to get their money, according to Hollywood.  Just look at ""The Island"" (where evil corporations make clones for body parts for evil rich), or ""The Runaway Jury"".  Maybe the Hwood producers are projecting their own jerkiness on to other corporations, I don't know, but this movie falls into this stupid, false and cliched political agenda at the end.  You see, all the action and killing in the movie is due to ....... Corporations knowing that their profits will go down when a scientist wants to donate the formula for revolutionary bio-engineered corn to the world!!  So they'll murder people to keep up their profits!???  This is such BS and it's so typical of Hollywood films.  You mean to tell me that a charitable scientist, funded by a Arab Prince, is going to help the world with his FREE invention, and thus is targeted by assassination by .... corporations???  You the reader, how many Fortune 500 corporations do you know that directly pay assassins to knock off their competitors (and saying that criminal drug cartels are part of the Fortune 500 is cheating)?  Try ZERO.  That's because they are run by people who either are mostly good, or at least do not want to go to jail.  The premise of Unknown just doesn't ring true.

Look at the world's organized killings & bombings -- a high percent by Islamic terrorists, a high percent by Mafiosias and Drug gangs, and perhaps another big chunk by Communists & dictators; and some in war zones.  But Islamic terrorists and Mexican drug kingpins are OFF LIMITS -- non-PC!! -- to the Hollywood crowd. So the makers of Unknown pin the blame on some corporation that wants to kill the saintly, selfless scientist who is going to save the world for free.  B. S. !  It made all the good plot elements sour for me.  It's a conspiracy theory that rings false, just like the paranoid theory that ""we would have had electric cars decades ago but the evil oil companies stopped them.""  Doesn't wash with me.

The story begins in an airliner high in the sky. A man writes notes. They arrive in Berlin, snow falls. The man checks his Blackberry. Was a suitcase lost? Can it be recovered? There is an accident and rescue. [Bad luck symbol?] Dr. Martin Harris lives! He can't remember a cell phone number. Four days have passed in a coma. Harris wants to find his wife, but he has lost his passport. He is impatient. ""Do I know you?"" says Liz. There is conflict. [A false note?] The police arrive. They check the Internet for his name. Whose picture is that? [Can you trust the Internet?] Harris leaves the hotel, the makes a telephone call to leave a message. Some man follows him, but he catches a subway train. His taxi driver has disappeared, but he finds her. Next he goes to see that German professor and finds his imposter there.

The police arrive to sort things out. Harris is back in the hospital for his memory loss. Another medical test. Something goes very wrong! Who is after him? Harris gets away, he goes to see detective Jurgen (a former member of the Stasi) recommended by Nurse Gretchen. Does he know Liz's past? Ask enough questions and a man may change his story. Harris finds Gina the taxi driver, who is an illegal immigrant. Jurgen does his research on the Biotech Congress. But there is another threat! The intruders play for keeps. But Harris and Gina get away. There is a car chase in the streets that ends in an accident. They find refuge in a night club, both are in danger. Harris decodes a book code message. Prince Shahida supports the work of bio-technical research into food production. They watch a building. Harris watches the man watching Liz. Liz explains she is being watched, they are in danger. Mr. Kohl calls Jurgen for a meeting.

Jurgen offers a drink to Mr. Kohl and tells about a secret agency that never fails. Harris and Gina recover his suitcase (ownership is proved by knowing the combination lock). Now Harris has his passport. [Foolish to keep it in a suitcase?] Should they wait in a caf? That professor meets Harris. Gina sees the kidnapping. Another car chase for action. ""There is no Martin Harris."" It is a legend made up to get into the convention! ""I'm really, really sorry."" ""Who am I?"" Gina arrives in time to save Harris (and tidy up the loose ends). There is a big surprise in that suitcase! Harris begins to remember the past. He and Gina go to that hotel. Liz drops a tracking device into a professor's bag. The police are on guard. Can a person use a remote device to copy files?

Will the police believe Harris and sound an alarm? Dressler was working on a strain of corn that would grow in any climate. Will things work as planned? Yes and no. There is another fight, only one survives. Will there be a happy ending? Dressler announces his donation of this corn to the whole world. [Stocks in agribusiness drop as a result.] Two people with valid passports leave Berlin. [You wonder what will happen to them next.]

This story seems like partly from an Alfred Hitchcock movie and from ""The Twilight Zone"". The character of Gina seems derived from that girl with the dragon tattoo. Parts seems incredible. If that secret agency never fails how did Martin survive all those attempts on his life? It is overly complicated for an assassination plot, there are simpler methods (based on the recent news where an Iranian scientist was murdered).

After that, it's a whodunit--or who is it--in Hitchcockian mode, with lots of car-chases, car-smashes, double-reverses, and hair-breadth escapes in the Bourne Identity manner.

The acting is great.  I have never been a fan of Liam Neeson (he always overacts or underacts just at the wrong moment), but here he is great.  You can see every emotion on his face and in his gestures: shock, confusion, bitterness, fear, hopelessness, rage, guilt, remorse, etc.  January Jones is a little stiff at first, but quickly gets better.  Ditto Aidan Quinn.  And Diane Kruger and Bruno Ganz steal the show.

The plot is convoluted and makes hardly any sense, but is great fun.

And the timing is superb.  You really don't have a clue what's going on till very near the end, and even then it's hard to tell what will happen.",1324166400,,1141,4.621890547263682

4300023,2,B004A8ZX28,"Sometimes while watching a moronic piece of sophistry like UNKNOWN you just feel like throwing your hands into the air and asking the heavens why you wasted upteen moments of your life that you will never, ever, get back.  And when said question is answered by a scene between Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella that borders somewhere between mind-numbing incredulity and unabashed vaudeville it becomes apparent that even the metaphysical realm recognizes the utter futility of your interrogative.  Which handsomely summarizes UNKNOWN, an alleged mystery/thriller that tries to be clever but can never get out of its own half-baked way.

Liam Neeson looks as confused and bewildered as the viewer playing humble scientist Dr. Martin Harris (or, is he really Martin Harris, pray tell?).  Involved in an auto accident causing a head injury further causing amnesia, Martin only has fleeting recollections of his past, and--gasp!--his own wife doesn't recognize him, and what's more--triple gasp!--someone else is pretending to be him!  Accordingly Martin goes about tearing up Germany as he attempts to get to the bottom of this diabolical dilemma, accompanied by an unwilling cab driver (Diane Kruger).  So we have contrived, melodramatic, and zany moments, culminating in Martin fully recovering his memory when it's time to kick some serious arse.  UNKNOWN had a brief window to be extraordinarily clever and original, but missed it by a country kilometer.  At least I got a little exercise throwing my hands in the air.

4300061,3,B004A8ZX28,"I wish I could sit here and give Unknown a solid review based on the fact it sounded *extremely* appealing to me based on the description, but sadly -due to the predictable and underwhelming nature of the storyline- the movie slowly sinks to a level of mediocrity as it rolls forward.

I mean, really!  It starts off on a REALLY positive note.  While riding a car down a busy city street in Germany, a man (Liam Neeson's character) sinks to the bottom of a lake, hits his head on the car window, and loses his memory.

From here, he eventually finds what he believes is his wife at a dinner party, and walks up to her and explains what's going on... unfortunately the woman doesn't recognize him... nor does the man standing next to his wife at the party who mysteriously happens to share the same name as Lian Neeson's character.  Talk about an intriguing way to begin a film!

However, it's soon discovered that the plotline doesn't move forward in a suspenseful or interesting kind of way at *all*.  Instead, we're introduced to mediocre car chase segments that we've seen in thousands of other movies, a car falling and crashing from a building after sitting through several more minutes of unsatisfying storytelling, and eventually a bomb explosion that seems more appropriate for a James Bond film.  Certainly not the plot direction *I* was anticipating based on Liam Neeson's memory loss portions of the movie (which many of us eagerly believed would entice us like never before- at least *I* did).

I dunno... some people might find Unknown appealing, but the disappointingly flawed storyline totally wastes a golden opportunity for an interesting shot at something original and enticing if you ask me.  I sure hope Liam Neeson isn't losing his touch as a fantastic main character in suspense films either- this is the second less than spectacular film I've seen him star in this year (can't remember the other one, but I *did* write a review for it back over the summer).",1322352000,,1980,4.7631578947368425

I contacted Warner Brothers about what had happened, and the representative told me there was nothing I could do because they adequately posted the expiration date on the DVD insert, the redemption Web site, and on the box. Two of those methods are moot because you have to open the box before finding out the information. The expiration date is on the back of the DVD in fine print, meanwhile the  ""+ digital copy"" is in very large print on the front of the box. How many times do you look at the back of a movie before buying it? So obviously Warner Brothers wasn't helpful, and Target wouldn't take the movie back even though some of the ""product"" had expired before purchase because I had opened it.

4300066,5,B004A8ZX28,"Before watching this movie, I had already read the book and knew the story. However, let me say this: the movie is better than the book. The movie takes the basic premise of the book, and turns it into an action thriller.

Basic premise: Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin for a biotechnology conference. As he and his wife Liz(January Jones) arrive at their hotel, Harris suddenly remembers that he accidentally left his suitcase at the airport. He jumps into a taxi driven by Gina (Kruger), but gets into an accident as the car crashes off a bridge and into the water. Gina saves him from drowning, and harris wakes up in the hospital with no recollection of what happened. He returns to the hotel to visit Liz, but finds her with another man who also claims to be Dr. Martin Harris. Liz does not recognize him, and Dr. Martin Harris is struggling to prove his identity to others and stop the impostor with her. Soon enough, Harris is chased by a killer, puts the lives of those around him in danger, and has to escape before it's too late.

At the crux of this movie is an Agatha Christie-type mystery. As both Martin harris and the viewers, struggle to figure out what is going on. The movie has some good chase scenes, and is filmed pretty vividly. Unlike the book, where Harris kind of goes from place to place trying to get some information (he visits the police station, stands outside of Liz's apartment building, goes to the American embassy, and is generally a passive character for three fourths of the book), the movie Martin Harris is much more interesting and active. Another interesting difference is that in the book the events take place in France, while in the movie events take place in Germany. Overall, though, this is a good action flick.",1320710400,2,1776,4.617088607594937

One thing that makes it a movie to be seen is that it isn't completely
ludicrous like so many movies today that are full of plots that seem to
come from a ten year old.

It's true that you have to stretch a little but not to much so that you

Fortunately, I was wrong, and it holds up with repeated viewings, as long as you accept the basic premise.  Liam Neeson's character undergoes a tremendous change in basic personality, not fully explained by his temporary amnesia, and a scientist carries the only copy of all his extensive and valuable research around in a single laptop computer without backup.

4300150,3,B004A8ZX28,"I've heard that to get a film made in Hollywood these days you need a big name star and to be able to define your project in terms of other successful movies. To that end, here we have Liam Neeson in a `melange a trois' of David Fincher's THE GAME (the score is even quoted in places) and BOURNE TRILOGY with a bit of Polanski's FRANTIC thrown in for good measure.

Despite that the result is decidedly average. It's certainly intriguing to begin with and there are a couple of genuinely tense scenes (the bit with the scissors in particular had me on the edge of my seat). Ultimately, however, the plot relies of a series of implausibilities (would Harris really rush back to the airport without uttering a single word to his wife?) and I found the denouement unsatisfying.

There's also a rather gratuitous sex-in-the-shower scene that's repeated like a motif throughout. And do we really need to see Liam Neeson with a wife who is so much younger?

Finally, if you know Berlin well you'll be utterly bemused by the continuity and how the film jumps around locations seemingly at random. There's no obvious reason for this, especially in the opening scene as the car appears to teleport back and forth along 17 Juni Strasse.

4300192,1,B004A8ZX28,"It takes a really bad movie to make Liam Neeson boring, and this is such a movie. The plot is a collection of blatant ripoffs from other movies that were mindlessly cobbled together. In this category of movie, the ""MacGuffins"" (or plot coupons) don't need to make a lot of sense because the action and pacing is _supposed_ to pull the viewers along, and not let them recognize that it is a MacGuffin, much less linger on it. This movie fails in both regards. First, the MacGuffins are so in-your-face preposterous that I couldn't not think about them. Second, the slow pacing of the movie didn't give me the opportunity to ignore how preposterous they were. Third, the action sequences are boring because they are mundane technically and I had no investment in any of the characters or in the story.

Liam Neeson's performance most of the time feels like a reading during a walk-thru (possibly one to determine why a scene isn't working). A photo of January Jones (the wife, third-billed) seems to have more on-screen time than the actress herself, and even when she is on-screen, the script and director seem to use her as little more than a mannequin. Diane Kruger (second-billed) gives a much more animated performance, but the script has her character as such an incoherent combination of parts that it comes across as ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"".

The preposterousness of the plot is hard to even partially explain without spoilers, but here's what I can say: The impetus for the whole story is Neeson's character leaving his briefcase at the airport, something that that character would _never_ have done. When he comes out of a coma four days after an accident, he finds that no one came to the hospital looking for him. Whether he is the real Dr. Martin Harris, an impostor, or something else, I could not conceive of any circumstance where he would not have been missed and someone would have tried to find him, and succeeded. When what is really happening is finally revealed, it only confirms how preposterous this MacGuffin was. Similarly, the bad guys attempting to kill him makes absolutely no sense from their perspective, and it is there simply to enable various chases and fights.

The two Dr. Martin Harrises are impossibly perfect in their identical knowledge of events and trivia. Not just far, far more than the plots requires, but detrimental to the plot. And preposterous relative to what the viewer eventually learns.

The best example of the how lazy and ill-conceived the script is can be seen in the coded message MacGuffin: The message is something that could have been trivially memorized. Even if there were some reason to write it down, it would have drawn no attention as clear text. In fact, the only purpose of the trivial encoding is to draw the attention of the characters to that information and its importance.

The MacGuffin of none of Dr. Harris' scientific collaborators being able to identify him is a ""homage"" to the 1920s and 1930s when long-distance travel was difficult and expensive.  The update is inconsistent. He talks with the collaborators on the phone, but doesn't use video chat -- an international collaboration is more likely to use Skype than traditional telephony. He has a web page with a picture on it, but none of the collaborators had visited it. Although to be fair, there are plenty of other movies in that category committing similar sins.

The over-arching MacGuffin here, involving genetically-modified organisms, is so in-your-face stupid and nonsensical that  middle-school students are likely to spot it and be insulted, unless they had already given up on the movie.

In fact the pivotal scene between Langella and Ganz threw me for a loop because it was so well acted and written which is unusual for a action movie of this type since good dialogue is usually not a hallmark of action movies.  The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is because January Jones as Neeson's wife was quite wooden and stiff in her role but perhaps that's why she was chosen since as the plot unravels we begin to understand her role more fully in the movie.

This is another movie I had to go and see on opening day, Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors and did he deliver another outstanding performance in this thriller, WOW. As soon as the movie started I was glued to the screen until the credits came up, that's how good the movie was. This film has it all, suspense, mystery, drama, and a little thrill all in one. I thought the entire cast worked well together; and Frank Langella was classic as an antagnoistic character. I wasn't expecting the twist near the end, which made the movie much more exciting. Who would have thought the true identity of Neeson would be that of a terrorist, I'm just glad he was able to change at the end. Another great movie in 2011; and it wasn't a superhero one either, this year we have been bombarded with superhero movies. I like those type of movies, a couple is fine, but 8 is a little 2 many, and it's just August.

Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson), a respected botanist, travels with his wife (January Jones) to Berlin for a scientific conference. After arriving at his hotel, he realizes that he left his briefcase with all his papers at the airport and leaves his wife to check in while he goes to retrieve it. There is an accident & he wakes up in a hospital after four days in a coma. He returns to the hotel where, not only does his wife not recognize him, but she's in the company of another man (a near cameo by Aidan Quinn) who says that HE is Martin Harris. With no identification & still nursing a head injury, he tries to piece together his past, while in his present, he is being pursued by vicious thugs intent on killing him. The only link to his recent past who can prove he's not insane is the cab driver who was involved in the accident with him (Diane Kruger). I had more fun counting the references to the two films I mentioned earlier than I did actually watching this paint-by-numbers popcorn cruncher, but as always, Liam Neeson brings a wounded intensity to material that isn't altogether worthy of it. I don't watch ""Mad Men"" but it's apparent here that January Jones has wandered rather far above her pay grade in a big-screen project.

Oh, throw a little ""Salt"" on this corn while you're at it. Maybe a dash of ""Mission: Impossible"", and a smidgin of ""The Fugitive"", too. Leaven with a pinch of ""The Constant Gardener"" & ""Duplicity"" for the cherry on top. Director Jaume Collet-Serra & his screenwriters are certainly up on their thriller genre, and Collet-Serra seems to have obtained the services of the Bourne cinematographer. Not as good as ""Taken"", but Neeson is always worth seeing.",1313712000,3,1836,4.628834355828221

Recommend it highly.  We have always enjoyed movies that Liam Neeson is starring in.  He is really a good actor.  I liked the previous one that he starred in where he goes after his kidnapped daughter. That was intense as well.

4300262,3,B004A8ZX28,"I have a feeling that Unknown may actually not be that good of a movie, but for some reason, Neeson is enthralling in these sort of high-stakes Eurotrips. It's a great setup. Neeson is knocked unconcious in the opening minutes, is in a coma for a few days, and when he finally wakes up, he finds someone else has taken over his life. No one believes Neeson's story -- probably because his wife doesn't back him up. This leaves the rest of the movie for Liam to run around Berlin, trying to prove his case and uncovering a vast Eco-terror plot in the process.

Liam simply owns these movies, and it's too his credit that he's reinvented himself as a thinking man's action star. There's also great supporting work from Diane Kruger as the cab driver who helps him (she doesn't get nearly enough work in Hollywood). If only the script had been a little better. Too many times they get help out of nowhere, from a kind-hearted nurse who just happens to know a former East German spy with nothing better to do but take on seemingly insane American hospital patients. It also helps that Diane's cab driver character is on good terms with a nightclub bouncer, giving them a great hideout when they're on the run from mysterious agents.

As the twists and turns mount, you think you're headed to a great pay-off, but the final twist seems too fabricated and unlikely, based on a serious of miraculous incidents (not least of which is why Liam cracked his head in the first place).

On the way to their hotel, the cab driver starts to talk on the radio in another language and Dr. Harris asks his wife, ""Did you understand any of this?""  She probably didn't but strangely enough I did understand every word of it.  You would think that people would speak German in Germany, but the cab driver was speaking Turkish.  In another part of the movie, a restaurant owner was also speaking Turkish.

Side Note: there is a large population of Turks living in Germany and unfortunately they are not well integrated or assimilated.  This causes friction between the Germans and the Turks.

The movie itself was exciting with unexpected turns of events.  After an accident causes Dr. Harris to lose part of his memory (along the lines of Bourne Identity movies), Dr. Harris discovers that his wife doesn't know him and another man has taken his identity.  But, this movie was not as good as the Bourne Identity series.  One part that did not jive was that earlier in the movie when he was Martin Harris, he was getting his *ss kicked.  But later on when he figured out his real identity, he started to fight back.  This is one big difference between this movie and the Bourne movies.  In Bourne movies, even though the protagonist lost his memory, his fighting skills were intact.

The snow spattered world of Berlin Germany is where we enter a Dr. Harris (Neeson), who gets a good bump on the head as his taxi accidentally plunges into an icey body of water. The beautiful German actress Diane Kruger becomes his permanant lifesaver.

  Hospitalized, he then makes his way through the European streets after a four day coma seeking his wife (January Jones) whom he arrived with. It is then (without much thinking)the premise of the film is set. Dr. Harris is not recognized by his wife and his ID appears to be stolen. Many twists and turns play out with a surprising caldron of excellent actors who solidify the plot. Bruno Ganz plays a stately detective which is a period piece of it's own.

  ""Unknown"" is extremely well filmed with harrowing car chases, relentless murderers and Hitchcockian imagery. Excellent on screen chemistry between Neeson and Kruger as they strive for survival against ruthless killers. An addendem is the German landscape that becomes a viseral peril. When the director bothered to put in a good old museum spy chase, I subconciously had to applaude. Frank Langella, in one the best roles I've seen him, plays badness like he owns it. Add unique flashbacks and some grand explosions for a spy thriller galore.

However implausible a storyline, the film is grounded enough to connect the realistic dots.

There are questions that really aren't answered (like how the super genius' passwords were obtained in the first place).

The first ten minutes into this movie and I am hooked. It begins with Dr. Martin Harris who traveled with his wife to Germany in order to attend some kind of a seminar. When the doctor and his wife arrived at the hotel, the doctor found out that he had forgotten a luggage in the airport, so he immediately grabbed a taxi and went back to the airport. But on the way, he got into an accident. The taxi plunged into the river and he hit his head.

The next thing he knew, he was already comatosed for four days and that the seminar is already starting. He remembered tid-bits of what happened, but not everything. He remembered his wife and the hotel though, so he went back to the hotel to search for his wife. To his dismay, when he finally got to his wife, his wife denied him, saying that she didn't know him. And another man, claiming to be Dr. Martin Harris walked over, saying that he was the doctor. And that the doctor himself was an impostor. Having no identification, Dr. Harris has no way of proving that he was himself. And so, questions begin coming up. Who is he? Is he really Dr. Martin Harris? Why did his wife said that she didn't know him? Who is that other man claiming to be Dr. Martin Harris? Why are there suddenly people who wants to take his life?

It all comes together in the end. The acting was really believable. Definitely A+. you can't help but sit there, waiting anxiously to see what will happen to this poor man who has been stripped of everything, wishing the best for him. Watch it.

4300387,4,B004A8ZX28,"This film did not do particularly well at the box office, so I was expecting a weak effort intended to cash in on the success Liam Neeson enjoyed in Taken.  I was pleasantly surprised that the film was actually quite good.  I was afraid that the resolution of the basic mystery was going to be far-fetched, as in the Jodie Foster film Flight Plan.  In fact, though, the resolution was quite satisfying.

[SPOILER ALERT]  It is true, though, as other reviewers have noted, that the film bears a strong resemblance to the Bourne Identity.  I have to say that it is not nearly as good as that film, but not bad on its own terms.  There are a few plot holes, however.  How plausible is it that the scientist who invents a new super strain of corn has all the information contained on the hard drive of his laptop, so that by killing him the bad guys keep the strain from being used?  The scientist is shown running a large lab and none of his research assistants have the information?  It's not kept on the labs computers?  Why be so secretive when he intends to give the strain away, rather than patent it?  In addition, the usual Hollywood paranoia about big business is in full play.  Somehow, I doubt any new strain of any crop would sweep the world in a way that would damage ""agribusiness"" significantly.  It also seemed a bit implausible that the January Jones character would go back to try to disarm the bomb.  She is apparently afraid of being identified, but wouldn't that also have been a problem if the original plan had come off?  Finally, when the ex-Stasi agent who is helping Liam Neeson, realizes one of the bad guys is coming to kill him, he commits suicide rather than shooting the bad guy.  Seems a bit weak.

Neeson's character in this film was much more believable, apparently lacking the ability to kill everything that walks.

The only reason it wasn't 5 stars is because when I was watching scenes of an American badass fighting guys trying to kill him, suffering from mental amnesia, in Germany, with a pretty blonde helping him out, the overwhelming thought was that I was watching ""Bourne Identity"" again.

What's worse, there is another man there who has assumed his identity. What's going on? And why?

This interesting film stars Liam Neeson with co-stars Diane Kruger, January Jones, and Aidan Quinn  with supporting roles by Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella.

Irish actor Liam Neeson (1952) is best known for his role in ""Schindler's List"" and as Qui-Gon Jinn in ""Star Wars"". A veteran of 80+ films, he was nominated for an Oscar, Golden Globe and a BAFTA for ""Schindler's List"" (1993) and a Golden Globe for ""Michael Collins"" (1996) and ""Kinsey"" (2004). Recently he has been in several films as an action hero - ""Taken"" (2008), ""The A Team"" (2010), ""The Next 3 Days"" (2010) - and this film is part of that transition.

You'll recognize Diane Kruger (1976) from her terrific role as Bridget from ""Inglorious Bastards"" (2009) and from her co-starring role in ""National Treasure"" (2004). She plays a taxi driver who gets involved helping Neeson.

January Jones (1978) plays Neeson's wife. She's best known for her award nominated performances in ""Mad Men"" and as Emma Frost from ""X Men - First Class"" (2011).

Irish actor Aidan Quinn (1959) plays the other man. Quinn is a veteran of more than 50 films and as many TV appearances. He was nominated for an Emmy for his work on ""Bury My Heart a Wounded Knee"" (2007) and ""Early Frost"" (1985).

Frank Langella (1938) appears briefly near the end of the film, and is the key to the film's resolution. Langella is best known for his ""Dracula"" films but I think his best work was as Nixon in ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008).

This is the type of film that seems familiar, but the unique twists will keep you guessing.",1309478400,,1866,4.7024539877300615
4300479,5,B004A8ZX28,"Liam Neeson proves his success as an action hero in TAKEN was no fluke.  UNKNOWN is a tense, suspenseful film fueled by Neeson's performance.
Neeson plays a doctor visiting Berlin for a high-tech conference with his beautiful wife (January Jones).  When he checks into the hotel, he discovers he left his briefcase at the airport.  He takes a cab driven by Diane Kruger, gets into a freak accident and wakes up in the hospital after a 4 day coma.  Upon returning to rejoin his wife, she claims she doesn't know him and her husband is Aiden Quinn.
From this point, Neeson is whirled into a vertox of proving just who he is.  He convinces Kruger and a retired German soldier (Bruno Ganz) to help him determine what's going on.
Although it's fairly obvious what's occurring, the script throws in enough twists to make the whole journey a wild ride.
The director maintains both a kinetic energy replete with a great car chase and dramatic breaks giving us more insight into the characters.  There's a brief but chilling scene between Ganz and Frank Langella that's superb in its simplicity.
I loved the relationship between Neeson and Kruger.  You can't help but root for these two as they bring down the villains.  I personally enjoyed UNKNOWN a little better than TAKEN but they are both great films.

The Blu-ray looks extremely good with a nice, sharp transfer. The cool color scheme of the theatrical version of the film is kept intact for this version. The lossless audio sounds terrific as well and is very active.

Unknown bolts onto blu-ray with a beautiful 1080p/AVC-encoded transfer. The images are clear defined. Each pore on all the thespians is seen with distinct clearness. Each hair follicle is shown with beauty and detail. Unknown's video transfer will easily satisfy the biggest videophiles to the casual observer. Warner Brothers does a top notch five star transfer with Unknown that will in the end gratify the viewer.
Equally impressive as Unknown's video quality is Unknown's audio quality. Sorting a beautiful DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround soundtrack, Unknown explodes onto blu-ray. The movie comes to life with its action scenes of car chases, one on one combat, to simple dialogue. No clouding in any scene nor is any dialogue muffled by music or drowned out by action sequences. Audiophiles will salivate as much as videophiles with this five star rating transfer.

The most disappointing about Unknown is the special features or I should say lack of special features. The one I am reviewing comes with a DVD/Digital Copy disc and two small featurettes (Liam Neeson: Known Action Star and Unknown: What is Known.). There is no real difference in the featurettes as they both run four and half minutes and talk mostly about the film's star, Liam Neeson. Warner Brothers should have offered the viewer some deleted and alternate scenes and disc commentary. For the disc commentary I would have loved a director's commentary and one with the stars of the film, especially Liam Neeson and the person who plays his replacement in the film Aidan Quinn.

Unknown is a well paced thriller. The main gripe both critics and patrons have of Unknown is that Unknown is not Taken 2, that is a good thing. In Taken, the plot and the story is laid out for you in the first thirty minutes of the film. For Unknown, the plot is paced throughout the movie and unlike Taken; Unknown has many twists and turns in the film. Unknown is well acted and paced phenomenally. If you go in expecting Taken, the viewer will be disappointed. If you go in with a clear mind, the viewer will be satisfied. This maybe one of those movies you need to see multiple times to appreciate the movies true value. Overall this movie is highly recommended and both the movie and disc are four star entertainment.",1308960000,,3080,4.731843575418995

I definitely got swept up in the story! I'll probably even watch it again. Liam hasn't failed me on-screen yet.",1308960000,30,513,4.586956521739131
4300540,4,B004A8ZX28,"I liked this movie. No, it's not `Taken 2', but I didn't feel like that was the expectation created by the previews. While the plot seemed obvious to others, I don't watch enough espionage films for that to be true for me, and I was as caught up in the mystery as the protagonist was for the first half of the film.

Liam Neeson's character is believable as a man who finds himself without his memory and in a world where his wife will not acknowledge him and another man seems to have taken over his life. Diane Kruger is excellent, but where is she supposed to be from? Ukraine? Maybe? This is a minor detail, but I guess because Kruger is German and the movie takes place in Germany, I was expecting her character to be, well, German.

Frank Langella is his usual amazing self. He looks like a teddy bear, but plays evil characters. Therefore, I love him. And Aidan Quinn gives a perfectly understated performance that adds to the credibility of the film.

Although January Jones does well in her scenes without Neeson, the two of them have zero chemistry. With him, she's very stiff, so it seems like a creepy older guy/too young woman situation there. To me, that was the only drawback in the film (although a pretty major one considering that the two of them are supposedly lovers).

Overall, I think this film won't appeal to those looking for the intensity of `Taken' or who are very familiar with the genre. However, for the rest of us, this film gets three and a half stars. Because of the performances of Langella, Quinn, and Kruger, I'm tipping it over to four.",1308873600,,1573,4.489510489510489

Many aspects of this cerebral suspense thriller are given to the audience in snippets - bits and pieces that involves the audience in keeping up with the ever-changing story line or simply throws everybody for a loop - especially the ending.  Adapted from the novel 'Out of my Head' by Didier Van Cauwelaert and molded into a screenplay by Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell this film needs a  seasoned director to make it work: Jaume Collet-Serra isn't quite there yet.

American Biotechnologist Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) arrives in Berlin with his wife Liz (January Jones) for an important world conference to unveil a newly developed failsafe corn developed by Professor Bressler (Sebastian Koch) and underwritten by Prince Shada (Mido Hamada).  But once at the hotel Matin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and while Liz checks in he grabs a taxi driven by Bosnian immigrant Gina (Diane Kruger): in an attempt to race against time the taxi is in an accident and plunges into the river - Gina escapes the underwater car and saves Martin's life.  Martin is comatosed in a hospital for four days attended by Dr. Farge (Karl Markovics) and wise nurse Gretchen (Eva L&ouml;bau) and when he awakens he has memory loss: he remembers his name and begins to piece together the events that brought him to the hospital, remembering that his wife Liz may be worried about him. He leaves AMA and begins a journey that proves to be a long one - his identity has been stolen by another man who claims to be  Martin (Aidan Quinn) and Liz claims she doesn't know her own husband.  Without identification and desperate for answers martin finds Gina who pledges to help him, supplying Martin with the name of an ex-Stasi spy Ernst J&uuml;rgen (Bruno Ganz) who helps Martin paste together his identity.  But the trouble has just begun as Martin finds himself being chased by a group of thugs (Olivier Schneider and Stipe Erceg), and Gina is helpful but in the middle of the situation with her dear colleague Biko (Clint Dyer) also in danger.  Even the appearance of martins old friend Rodney Cole (Frank Langella ) doesn't aid Martin's quest for regaining his complete memory until a jarring turn of events introduces a whole new explanation for the strange plot that is so full of twists it almost sinks from its own weight.

The cast is strong and Liam Neeson again proves that characters such as this fit perfectly into his charismatic macho appearance.  The other reliable pros - Diane Kruger, Sebastian Koch and Bruno Ganz - add credibility to their roles and there are many relatively new faces that seem to show great promise in screen presence.  Yes, there are some fine car chases and pyrotechnics, all well captured by Flavio Labiano's cinematography.  The driving musical score is the work of John Ottman and Alexander Rudd.  Though is a bit over long at 2 hours, it does deliver some fine entertainment. Just leave the sense of logic on the shelf for this one. Grady Harp, June 11",1308700800,,3007,4.79110251450677

An accident occurs and he wakes up in a hospital four days later.  When he finally realizes who he is he heads back to find his wife.  When she claims to have never seen him before and meets the man that says he is him Dr. Harris begins his quest to reveal the truth.  This is the best kind of action-thriller movie.  Just when you think you have the truth figured out a twist happens and you are left guessing again.  To talk more about the movie itself will give too much away, but I am usually very good at predicting the ending to movies, but this one got me. Liam Neeson is excellent at playing parts like this and I hope he continues to do it.  The supporting cast is also excellent, as is the writing.  Very entertaining movie.  Not quite as fun as ""Taken"", but it's also a different kind of movie.  Overall, a must see for action fans, will keep you guessing all the way until the end.  I say B+.

4300585,2,B004A8ZX28,"Here's the problem with UNKNOWN: it has nothing new to offer.  If you've seen any espionage film, you'll know the basic premise (including the ""twist"") from the trailer alone.  This knowledge of previous story lines ruins any of the film's suspense; you know how it's going to go, and all you can do is sit there and let director Jaume Collet-Serra drive you around for a couple hours.  (NOTE: I did not call this an ""action"" film, because there is very little action until the last two-thirds; this is not TAKEN, despite what the marketing campaign would have you believe, and if you go into it like that you will be even more disappointed than normal.)

That's not to say the film is without any redeeming features (there are two stars in this review, after all).  The story is trite: man loses his identity, struggles to prove he is who he says he is.  Way too many plot-holes here; part of the fun in watching the film is picking all of them out.  Aside from January Jones, who gives an utterly wooden performance as (maybe/maybe not) Mrs. Liam Neeson, the performances are decently solid.  Neeson himself has done way, way better, but he's still a strong presence (he CAN give a bad performance, but he rarely does).  Aidan Quinn, as Neeson's possible replacement, is dangerously charming--is he hiding something or isn't he?  Diane Kruger is the anchor of the lead cast here; she seems to know what kind of film she's making, and decides to walk an even balance between hamming it up and keeping things serious.  As for the more supporting cast, kudos to Frank Langella and Bruno Ganz, who share a tremendously understated scene together; seriously, rent the movie for this one scene alone, and watch it repeatedly.  Especially for those of you wannabe actors who are curious as to how two older men can completely and thoroughly steal a movie in just five minutes.

The script is predictable and the directing is inconsequential.  You've seen better espionage films; this is BOURNE-lite, so lite that it's pretty much water with a little sugar added.  If you go into it without any great expectations, perhaps you'll be okay; but as it is, this film is a C-grade thriller at best, passable but utterly forgettable.  Aside from that great Langella/Ganz scene, everything here is recycled from previous films, and will be recycled yet again somewhere down the line.",1308528000,3,2370,4.772058823529412

The Film 4/5

Unknown's plot is extremely simple once you know a key piece of information, but that's not revealed until late in the movie. As a result, you'll find yourself confused and having to guess what's really going on. On first viewing, Unknown is full of mystery and puts the viewer in the position of the main protagonist, Martin Harris (Neeson). Like Memento, the story keeps letting us see events in a new context and their meaning changes as a result.

Harris flies into Berlin with wife Liz (Jones) for a biotechnology conference. He's one of the speakers. While getting into a taxi at the airport, he leaves behind a briefcase containing his passport and vital documents. Does that seem like the act of a man with the supposed intelligence of Harris? He notices that it's missing when they arrive at the hotel and jumps into another taxi while his wife checks in. There's no signal for his phone (really) so he can't explain his actions.

The taxi is involved in an accident and plunges into a river. The driver, Gina (Kruger), pulls him out and then runs off leaving him in the hands of the medics. He wakes up in hospital and all he can remember is his name and that he's married to Liz, who doesn't know where he is. The doctor tells him that he's been in a coma for four days.

Luckily, he sees a story about the conference on TV in his room and remembers that he's supposed to be attending. It shows the hotel where he was supposed to check in. How convenient. After checking out and going to the hotel, he sees his wife at a reception. The problem is she says that she doesn't know him. She even introduces another man as her husband, Martin Harris. The hotel security men throw him out. Are you confused yet? Is he really Martin Harris? Is everything we are seeing just some coma-induced dream? Is he crazy?

The story continues with Harris trying to prove his identity. He finds Gina and she agrees to help him. He also phones a friend in the US who he knows can confirm his identity. His memories slowly start to return and he notes everything he can remember. One piece of information tells him that he has a meeting arranged with Professor Bressler, who he communicated with by phone and email for a while. Maybe Bressler can confirm his identity? It wouldn't explain his wife's actions, but it would be a start.

I won't reveal any more of the story because it would ruin the mystery, but it contains a few glaring plot holes. The exposition is also laughable at times and assumes that the audience is pretty dumb. My favorite example is: ""So that's got all your secrets in it, right?""

You might be wondering why I gave the movie such a high score if it's full of so many plot holes and stupid dialogue. The reason is it somehow works. Neeson is such a good actor that he pulls it off. I found myself actually caring about his predicament and wanting to see him resolve it. Most of the supporting cast does a great job too and I was especially impressed with Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella.

Did you see the movie posters advertising the theatrical run? It showed Neeson holding a gun and looking ready to take on the world. In short, it was marketed as Taken 2. If you buy the movie on the strength of that image, you may be disappointed. Neeson doesn't touch a gun at any point in the movie. There are a couple of car chases and scenes full of action, but this is nothing like Taken. Neeson does get into a couple of fights, but this is more a mystery than an action movie. Fans of Taken might like Neeson enough to enjoy this too, but be aware that the two movies are very different.

I found myself invested in the story, even though I could see that parts of it were contrived or even ludicrous. Neeson plays it dead straight and is believable in his role. Kruger did a good job as his sidekick. I've watched the movie twice now and will be happy to watch it again despite its flaws.

Video Quality 4.5/5
I have no complaints about the picture quality. Fine grain is present throughout and detail is always strong. I detected one slightly noisy image in a dark scene, but that's a minor quibble. Colors look accurate and the presentation is clean and bright. You'll be very happy when you see it.

Audio Quality 5/5
The movie starts quietly, but gradually increases in volume as the action rises. Dialogue is always clear, but the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track really starts to shine when we see the car crash. The action scenes in the final act all benefit from heavy use of the surrounds and you'll feel like you're in the middle of the action. The audio presentation is flawless.

Special Features 1/5

There are two HD features which run for a total of nine minutes and the content of each overlaps with the other. I hoped for much more.

Liam Neeson: Known Action Hero (4:33) - Brief interviews with the cast and crew about the making of the film.

Unknown: What is Unknown (4:24) - Similar in content to the opening feature, but it's more of an extended advertisement and appears to have been shot before the movie was released.

I'm not sure what Unknown is supposed to be. There are too many holes for it to be a serious drama or compelling mystery, but there's not really enough action for it to fall into that genre. If you go into it with the right attitude, you'll probably enjoy it. I had fun watching it the first time and enjoyed seeing it on Blu-ray. For fans of Neeson, it's worth adding to your collection. For action fans, it could fail to meet expectations. The Blu-ray presentation certainly won't disappoint, but there's very little in the way of special features.

4300588,3,B004A8ZX28,"First at all, I must say Liam Neeson is a versatile actor, the cast who accompanied him (Dianne Krugger, Charlize Theron and Paz Vega are to my mind the three most beautiful actresses of the world, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella) is towering too.

But once more, let's remember Hitchcock. ""The three basic elements of a good movie are First: a good script,Second, a good script and Third a good script.

Maybe the hand of Roman Polanski (who is in his element with this material) would have carried the movie for better destinies. But the spectacular chases are by themselves the jewel of the crown, leaving behind the raw material of a script which could have been improved.

4300590,2,B004A8ZX28,"Warning there might be some spoilers ahead. I haven't seen a movie in just about two months since Tron Legacy. There wasn't anything that interested me until UNKNOWN. It looked like it would be a good action/suspense movie but I was wrong. I'll be blunt this movie was pretty boring. It's kind of reminds me of The American with George Clooney. It had potential but failed to rise above ordinary to bad.

The story follows Dr. Martin Harris(Liam Neeson) and Elizabeth Harris(January Jones) who have arrived in Berlin for a conference. Things are going well for them until Martin gets into a accident. When he awakes he finds out there's someone else has taken over his life and impersonating him. Things go from bad to worse when he tries to prove who he is. The overall story isn't very good a plot to assassinate someone at the conference. The intriguing part is Martin. Is he really Martin Harris or is the other Martin the real one. The payoff worked well when you find out who he really is. The problem with the story is the pacing and the editing of the story. How many minutes were wasted with Martin just wandering the streets. I mean it must have been ten minutes. Then there was the action which was few an far between and outside of one good scene was bad. Then there was the ending which planned sucked.

The acting was what hurt the movie the most. All the lead actors seemed to be on autopilot through this movie. Liam Neeson did a ok job. There were times he did a great job and there were others he seemed to be on autopilot. Aidan Quinn and January Jones seemed like zombies. The only one of the leads that showed any real emotion was Diana Kruger(Gina). Because of the bad acting you or at least I ended up not caring one bit about any of them. Oh one of them died all well who cares and you move one. The actor who stole the show and the film was a supporting actor. His name is Bruno Ganz. I had never heard of him before. He plays Ernst Jrgen a ex Stasi(The East German State Security) officer. His character is the most intriguing and surprisingly the most likable. Ernst is also in the best scene in the movie. Where he is at his home with Rodney Cole(Frank Langella). This two veteran actors do a superb job but again Bruno is the one that shines. To be honest I wish the made the movie about his character.

Now back to the action that was hard to find. The fight scenes weren't very well done. The climax in a hotel was done terribly. Maybe the director wanted to rely on the mystery and suspense but those two weren't good enough make this a good movie. I don't mind movies with out a long of action but when there is it had better be good. The only really great action scene in the near midway part of the film where there is a car chase in the streets of Berlin which I thought was really well done.

As for directing by Jaume Collet-Serra was bad. Which I guess shouldn't be surprising once I found out who he was and what he directed before. He's only directed four movies and the only one I know about or seen is the god awful HOUSE OF WAX. I wish the movie studio had found someone else to direct this movie maybe then it would have been better.

Overall a below average to bad action/suspense movie that I'd skip if I were you.",1307145600,5,3261,4.304560260586319

Liam Neeson is obviously no ""Ahh-nold"" when it comes to the body but he's a much better actor which gives this film a much needed boost.

**********Spoilers**********

Why did I give it 3 stars? Because it kept me guessing until just the same spot that ""Total Recall"" did.

To his great surprise, Liz doesn't know him. Not only that; there is another Dr. Martin Harris (Aidan Quinn), who claims HE is the husband of Liz. Something must have happened while the ""first"" Martin Harris was in coma for four days, but what could that be?

""Unknown,"" directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (a 2005 ""House of Wax"" an ""Orphan""), starts with an intriguing premise, keeps us guessing for quite some time until the final chapter that is slightly underwhelming. To explain how underwhelming is really hard without spoiling much - be assured, no spoilers ahead - but all I can say is, though (or because) everything fits in the right place, the story looks too implausible, or silly at some parts, even by the standards of Hollywood thrillers. (Why didn't Liam Neeson's character just tell Liz where he was going? Or how about his briefcase? How could he be so careless?)

As in a recent hit thriller ""Taken,"" Liam Neeson delivers solid acting as the film's confused and disoriented hero. Supports from veterans Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella are also impressive, sharing a brief but tense scene of suspense, though Diane Kruger as a taxi driver is less convincing. There is one effective car chase scene though I am not sure we really need a car chase scene at all.

Well-paced and well-acted, ""Unknown"" is a kind of rollercoaster ride that remains entertaining throughout, with actions and surprises, but once it is over, you may not be sure the thriller is really as unique and original as it initially looks.",1304812800,2,1759,4.872909698996655

In this special case, even a short plot summery might ruin the experience.
What can be said is that the story revolves around the efforts of Dr. Martin Harris (Liam Neeson) to reclaim his life after being involved in a car accident and the difficulties he faces doing so.
In the process, he meets with a few people who try to help; one of them is Ernst Jrgen - played by Bruno Ganz - who gives no short of an Oscar worthy performance. Ganz portrays the character of a veteran Stasi operative, now a detective for hire, who manages to steal every scene he takes part in. The viewer can just marvel at the skill, expertise and emotion that are rarely seen in action-packed movies.

If you liked the movie ""Taken""(2008) with Liam Neeson as a former CIA operative saving his daughter in France from the mafia that kidnaps the girls and forced them into prostitution, you should like the new movie Unknown (2011) with Neeson in the title role of an American scientist, Dr. Martin Harris, who arrived  with his young beautiful wife Beth (January Jones) in Berlin to give a speech on the biotechnology summit. Just minutes after arrival, Dr. Harris fell into a coma as a result of  a car accident and after four days of coma awaking in a Berlin hospital, he found out that no one, including his own wife does not recognize him, and that his identity and his all life was taken by another person with the same name. If you are a fan of Neeson - the film should appeal to you. Neeson has tremendous screen presence and charisma.  Looks like age is no obstacle to him. The cast also includes two beautiful actresses, January Jones and Diane Kruger. The scene between two veteran actors, Bruno Ganz and Frank Langella elevates the film above its genre. If you are a fan of the twisted thriller / mystery / action / suspense, and not just one but double or even triple twists and turns, you should not read this but run and watch the movie. :)  Seriously, it is exciting, gripping and suspenseful film. It seemed predictable in the beginning but it surprised me with its revelations in the final part. I think the first film in what may become the series, ""Leam Neeson's dangerous adventures in Europe"", Taken is better because I truly rooted for Bryan/Neeson. Taken's twists and turns concerned more the identities of the ""bad guys"", and as questionable Bryan's actions were, I always wanted him to succeed and find his daughter before it was too late. Unknown is morally ambiguous. I think the title is very appropriate with the constant developments of the character as his memory of the events before his accident began coming back but the movie's got too many holes in the plot to make as convincing case for Dr. Harris as it was for Bryan Mills.

*****************Major Spoilers. Don't read if you did not see the film. ***********************************

Unknown makes you think that perhaps bumping one's head and felling into coma could actually help to clear the head in reality and to cure the very dangerous terrorists by changing their outlook completely. Unknown also suggests that no matter how carefully and thoroughly you plan the major secret operation, thinking that you predicted and backed up everything and everybody, there is always something you'd overlook or simply could not fathom.

***************End of Spoilers****************************************************************************

As its predecessor Taken, Unknown is enjoyable action/thrillers/mystery. Its plot may not be original -Frantic/Fugitive/Total Recall/Bourne Identity and last year's Shutter Island inevitably come to mind but good acting, Neeson's likability, fast and furious car chase and crash scenes and plenty twists and turns however implausible they are, made Unknown a lot of fun for me to watch in the theater last weekend.

In addition, the film can be recorded in the Guinness Book of Records for the number of deadly car crushes one character was involved in.

4300628,4,B004A8ZX28,"If you are fortunate enough to find yourself in a hit film, Hollywood will most likely ask you to repeat the success and either make a sequel or make a film so similar it could be a sequel. The enticement? Usually a large, mega-size paycheck.

A few years ago, Liam Neeson stumbled into a new genre of film with ""Taken"", a silly action film conceived and produced by Luc Besson, the French Joel Silver. It was a big hit and proved the addition of the venerable actor's gravitas to a dumb action film could help the movie stand out from the pack. Hollywood was eager to replicate the success, so Joel Silver brought ""Unknown"" to the popular star.

""Taken"" and ""Unknown"" have their respective producer's stamp all over them; Besson films are marked by outlandish, unbelievable story turns and Silver's films usually contain elaborately choreographed improbable action sequences. Yet, because both films star Neeson, and both are set in European cities, I think people assume both films are more similar than they actually are.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed ""Taken"". In it, Neeson's character uses his dormant skill set, abandoned when he changed jobs to save his marriage, to travel to Paris and track down his kidnapped daughter. Unlike Besson's next film ""From Paris With Love"", ""Taken"" works because, and only because of, Neeson's performance. He is so serious throughout you begin to believe he could actually track down his daughter and fight his way though the multitude of bad guys surrounding her.

In ""Unknown"", Neeson's character, Dr. Martin Harris, and his quest, have a lot more turns and facets, making the journey more cerebral, more suspenseful and more interesting.

That said, my partner guessed the storyline after watching the preview a few months before we actually got to see the film. But I found myself becoming engrossed in the story just the same,

Dr, Martin Harris (Neeson) and his wife, Liz (January Jones, TV's ""Mad Men"") arrive in Berlin for a summit. Henry has been invited to speak at a summit sponsored by a leading scientist (Sebastian Koch) ready to reveal a major breakthrough. A controversial Arab leader also sponsors the summit. Because of all of this, security is tight. Upon their arrival, Martin realizes he left his briefcase at the airport and hails a taxi to go back and get it. Liz stays to check in. On the way to the airport, the taxi gets in an accident and plunges into the river. Gina (Diane Kruger), the driver, saves Martin but quickly runs off. Four days later, Martin wakes up in the hospital. He rushes back to the hotel and finds Liz, but she doesn't recognize him. In fact, she introduces Martin, and hotel security, to her husband, Martin (Aidan Quinn). Martin becomes frantic and confused. Then people start trying to kill him.

Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (""Orphan"", ""House of Wax (2005)""), ""Unknown"" would be referred to by many as 'Hitchcockian'. Many thrillers are still labeled with this term, trying to draw a connection to the renowned filmmaker. ""Unknown"" is one of the few films deserving the connection; it is evocative of late Hitchcock, lesser Hitchcock, ""Torn Curtain"" Hitchcock, but Collet-Serra gets enough right to earn this comparison.

Once again, Neeson's gravitas makes the film watchable and more interesting than it may have a right to be.

From the moment the film begins and we meet the couple in the airplane upon their arrival in Berlin, Martin is a serious man; he Is seriously in love with his wife, seriously interested in delivering a good speech at the conference, seriously interested in his colleague's research, seriously confused and becomes seriously pissed off at the people trying to kill him. As soon as he wakes up in the hospital, he tries to piece together what happened. He's been in a coma for four days? His wife has been alone in a city she doesn't know for four days? Then he realizes his wife has been alone for four days while he was in a coma. He rushes to the hotel and spots her.

Neeson plays the role straight. In every moment, he has a goal. The goal changes throughout the film, but we always know what he is trying to figure out. The key to his performance is when Martin spots Liz in the hotel. She stares at him blankly, seems a bit confused, and introduces him to her husband. Martin is thoroughly defeated. Maybe he did get things mixed up. Maybe he does have a concussion and the accident was more harmful than he felt. So he returns to the hospital. As he waits for the doctor to run additional tests, someone tries to kill him. He gets pissed off and realizes someone; somewhere is trying to hide something.

January Jones is cool and icy and evocative of Tippi Hedren. Liz is enough of an enigma to remain mysterious. Jones walks a tightrope throughout. She has to convince us everything she knows is true, basically contradicting everything we learn. She doesn't seem to fit into the puzzle, but because she is so sure Martin is not her husband, she causes him to feel doubt.

The last piece of the puzzle is Diane Kruger's Gina. As she drives the cab Martin is in when he has the accident, is she a piece of the puzzle as well? How does she fit into the puzzle? Gina, an illegal living in Berlin, trying to desperately raise money to get her papers and get out of the city. She takes shifts driving her friend's cab and works other jobs. She seems real and authentic throughout. And in this type of film, this usually means she is involved in some way.

Bruno Ganz has a memorable role as Ernst Jurgen, a former Stazi agent who now fills his time as a private eye. He calls on his considerable connections to help him figure things out and tries to help his new client, Martin. There are other facets to his character that make him even more interesting and unusual.

Martin is given Jurgen's contact information and arranges to meet with him. Jurgen seems perplexed by the changes going on in the society around him but faces the daily challenges with a certain amount of detachment. After listening to Martin's story, he agrees to poke around a bit. This character is a nice touch because he adds validity to Martin's quest.

Frank Langella pops up as one of Martin's colleagues, a man who may be able to help piece the puzzle together.

""Unknown"" has a lot of twists and turns. Generally, these can be problematic. The filmmakers are usually not skilled enough to tie everything together, to make everything fit in a believable way an d most viewers are savvy enough to spot these problems right away. But Collet-Serra makes them work. Less skilled directors learn about Hitchcock's use of the 'MacGuffin' and think it gives them license to do whatever they want. But Hitchcock understood he was making a deal with the audience. If the hero is looking for a wine bottle filled with uranium ore or a small statue filled with microfilm, this item needs to remain ever present in the film. This item drives the characters to do what they are doing. The MacGuffin is essential. We don't need to know what it is, but we need to know it is important.

In ""Unknown"", the MacGuffin is basically a scientific discovery to be revealed at the conference. Throughout the film, as Martin tries to figure out what is going on, the conference looms in the background. Martin and Liz are traveling to attend the conference. An Arab leader is hosting the conference, leading to heightened security. Professor Bressler, the key speaker, is rumored to have a big announcement scheduled for the conference. As soon as Martin wakes up, he tries to figure out what is going on and everything keeps pointing back to the conference.

""Unknown"" is produced by Joel Silver, so improbable; over the top action scenes are part of the mix. Surprisingly, these are fairly well integrated and don't detract from the overall experience.

Neeson's newest is a surprise, the pacing is taught, the mystery involving, the suspense is good and the acting is believable. Well worth your time and money.",1299801600,5,8004,4.72883787661406

4300630,4,B004A8ZX28,"The plot of ""Unknown"" might not bear much scrutiny after you've seen it, but the movie succeeds totally in its goal of giving you an exciting two hours. Liam Neeson is charismatic as usual in the role of a professor attending a conference in Berlin who has a serious accident, awakes from a four-day coma, and discovers that everyone--including his wife--denies his existence. Diane Kruger (of ""Inglourious Basterds"" fame) is ethereally beautiful as the cab driver who helps Neeson recover his identity.

Without getting into plot details, ""Unknown"" resembles a mashup of ""The Bourne Identity,"" Polanski's ""Frantic,"" ""Total Recall"" and the short-lived TV series ""Nowhere Man."" As Neeson's ice-princess wife, January Jones has a function in the plot and fills it competently. The same might be said for Aidan Quinn and Frank Langella in their roles, though they do it with more authority than Jones. The great Bruno Ganz, playing an ex-Stasi agent turned private eye, steals every scene he's in, and various big names from German cinema wander through the movie, including Karl Markovits of ""The Counterfeiters"" and Sebastian Koch of ""The Lives of Others."" The story of ""Unknown"" is bits and pieces of things we've seen before, but it offers enough red herrings, mysterious characters, murderous assassins, car chases and explosions to keep you thoroughly entertained.

4300631,3,B004A8ZX28,"(Note: this review has spoilers so if you don't want to know them, _don't_ read beyond the first half.)

Unknown, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and starring Liam Neeson, is a decent thriller that keeps things interesting for most, though unfortunately not all, of the film. It had the potential to be so much more, but about three-quarters of the way in it tosses that potential aside and deflates into Hollywood cliche. A large part of the blame for this must be laid at the feet of Collet-Serra (who aside from directing music videos and TV commercials, was responsible for the hideous remake of House Of Wax and the cliche-ridden Orphan) and the hack writers Oliver Butcher (Dr. Jekyll and Ms. Hyde) and Stephen Cornwell (Marshal Law, Killing Streets), whose only real claim to fame is that he's the son of John LeCarre.

Dr. Martin Harris (Neeson), a prominent botanist, arrives in Berlin with his beautiful wife (January Jones) to attend a conference. When they reach the hotel, Harris realizes he left his briefcase back at the airport and goes back to get it, hailing a cab driven by Gina (Diane Kruger), a Bosnian immigrant working in Germany illegally. An accident on the way back to the airport sends the taxi off a bridge and into a river, causing Harris to strike his head and go unconscious.  He wakes up in a hospital four days later with hazy memories and no identification, his passport and other documents apparently in the missing briefcase. The hospital, not knowing who he was, had not been able to notify anyone. Harris, worried about his wife, hurries to a reception at the conference, only to find that his wife does not recognize him and that there is another man with her (Aidan Quinn) claiming to be her husband... Dr. Martin Harris. And to his confusion and consternation, his wife is acting as if the other Harris is her husband while professing to never have seen Neeson's Harris before in her life. Furthermore, Quinn's Harris has identification as well as photos of him with his wife, and an internet check turns up Quinn's photo as Dr. Harris and not Neeson's.

From that point, Harris must try to prove who he is, to himself as much as to everyone else, and to find out why his wife is refusing to acknowledge his identity. He goes back to where his problems all began - with the cab ride back to the airport - and manages to track down Gina and convinces her to help him. Then strange things start happening. People are trying to kill him and anyone he comes into contact with. He finds messages in code that make no sense but seem to have something to do with a conspiracy. And he keeps getting flashes of memory that seem real and yet are confusing and dream-like. Just who is Martin Harris? And is he the real Harris?

The cast is generally capable.  Neeson turns in his usual first-class performance while most of the other actors are workmanlike, if not exactly riveting, in theirs. Bruno Ganz however outshines everyone else in the film in a minor role as a thoroughly unapologetic and unrepentant former Stasi (East German secret police) officer Neeson seeks out to help prove who he is. Ganz (Wings of Desire, Downfall) is truly a marvel to watch, showing how a great actor can turn what might have been a trivial role into one that steals every scene he's in. Frank Langella, a very gifted actor when given the chance (Frost & Nixon, Good Night And Good Luck), is unfortunately wasted in this film. He's played so many villainous and/or creepy characters in recent years that he's become type-cast and his mere presence is a dead giveaway that his character is not on the side of the angels.

All in all, Unknown is a watchable if not particularly memorable thriller, so long as you are willing to suspend the average level of disbelief and don't mind its failure to rise above the level of usual Hollywood fare.

(*** Warning - From this point on, spoilers await ***)

A number of problems keep Unknown from living up to its potential, a big one being its sheer predictability: I had already guessed what the mystery of the two Harrises was just from seeing the trailer.  It really was fairly obvious that there was no real Martin Harris and that Neeson had only been pretending to be Harris when the accident threw a monkey wrench into everything.

The other problems with the film generally fall into three categories: (1) characters behaving either stupidly or inconsistently because the plot requires it, (2) plot-holes and character actions requiring repeated suspension of disbelief, and (3) taking the easy, cliched way out to resolve things rather than going in a direction that the audience might not have expected.

In no particular order, Unknown is burdened with:

Characters with inexplicable driving skills.  One has to wonder about taxi drivers - not to mention botanists - who  somehow pull off stunts and maneuvers that would (and probably did) stagger entire teams of experienced stunt-men.

Head trauma as a force for good.  It's been done so many times that it's almost a film cliche that a villain, having taken a good knock in the head that leaves him unable to  remember who or what he really is, somehow undergoes a personality transformation that stays in place even when he finally remembers. And so Neeson's professional assassin who had no problems whatsoever killing people in the past and was on a mission to kill new targets, is now nobly scrambling to save them.  The film would have been far more interesting if Neeson's personality had reverted to sociopathic killer when his memories returned. But then that wouldn't have given the cliched Hollywood ending the script was calling for.

Pointless code to be solved. The whole sub-plot around the code, written by Jones, that Neeson finds in a book he's carrying is ridiculous as the only thing they're concealing is the Latin names of two flowers.  First of all, who couldn't simply remember the Latin names of two flowers? Secondly, given that Jones is using them to hack into a laptop from another laptop, why wouldn't she simply keep them on her own laptop?  And why did she bother writing them in a book Neeson was carrying?  Particularly given that when she needed them to hack into the target laptop, she didn't use the book at all.

Convenient loss of specific items. A large part of the plot depends on Neeson losing his identification in the accident. But it also depends on him not losing the book and on having some cash.  So voila!  While being fished out of the river, he somehow loses all identification but still has plenty of cash and the book with the code written in it.  Why?  Because the plot requires it.

Gina. So, we have a female cab driver (already a low-level probability) with fashion-model good looks (an even lower probability) who speaks perfect English (try finding one of those here!) and who continues to hang around Neeson even after it's clear that he's being pursued by professional assassins who are killing anyone Neeson comes into contact with.

People being stupid and/or incompetent because the plot demands it.  Once their targets are no longer in the hotel room, Jones' assassin goes back to disarm the bomb.  For what earthly reason?  Because the plot demands it. And despite knowing everything about where the bomb is, how it's armed, and exactly when it's supposed to go off, she fumbles around ineptly for five minutes trying to disarm the bomb until it finally goes off, killing her and only her.

When the shaved-head assassin goes to Neeson's hospital room to finish him off, he kills two nurses in short order, snapping their necks. But for Neeson, instead of simply snapping his neck like the others, the killer decides to tie him to a gurney and then inject some kind of drug into his IV bag which will take minutes to make it down the tube into his system.  Why?  To make it seem like an accident? When he's already leaving two bodies very obviously murdered? Because the plot demands it, that's why.

And why do the other assassins keep trying to kill Neeson in such a way that it will look like a drug accident/overdose?  They've been leaving bodies littered left and right with broken necks all over Berlin but for some reason Neeson must look like a drug death? Why? Because the plot requires Neeson must always have enough time to avoid being killed.  Stupid.

And on top of it all, the whole elaborate conspiracy to kill a scientist by making it seem as if he was simply a bystander killed in a bombing attack on a rich Arab prince?  Why?  Again, because the plot demands it.

All in all, Unknown was an okay thriller, but only just barely.  In the end it was both frustrating and disappointing.  Frustrating because it had the potential to be so much more; disappointing because it settled for the safe, lame and thoroughly cliched Hollywood outcome that we've seen a thousand times before.",1299196800,49,8880,4.719093851132686
4300632,3,B004A8ZX28,"I guess if you really want to put an American in a harsh situation, have him lose his memory in a foreign country. For Americans that's probably the closest thing to Hell on Earth, right up there with being denied Monday Night Football in Hi-Def. (Just kidding) A few films have similar premises of an American being a fish out of his own waters: ""the Bourne Identity"", ""Frantic"", and ""Seven Days Seven Nights"". Hollywood is also replete with stories about people either losing their memories or simply being ""lost"" inside a political situation because of forces beyond their control, such as ""the Changeling"", Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"", ""the Truman Show""; even ""Total Recall"" and ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" have similarities.

The one element that saves these movies is the premise of the main character being in essentially a ""no win situation"". Despite how contrived or ""unrealistic"" the whole plot is, if the character is interesting enough, and the situation compelling enough, then you tend to run with it. Part of the fun is learning the greater story along with the character. It may have become a rather over-used plot devise, but it tends to work, in part because pieces of the puzzle can be thrown at the character without him understanding what it means.

""Unknown"" falls into this category of a character being trapped in a situation he does not completely understand, and the story is told almost entirely from the his point of view. After a near-death experience in Berlin, an American wakes up in a hospital room and his only knowledge is that he is Dr Martin Harris and he was there for a Biotech conference. But he has lost his identification along the way, and no one seems to believe him. He even returns to the hotel where he was supposed to be staying and finds his wife. Except his wife not only denies him but appears to be married to a man also by the name of Dr Martin Harris. Will the real Martin Harris please stand up? Starts to ring of a suspense version of the old television show ""To Tell the Truth"" where three people would claim they were the same person, and panelists would try to figure out who was the ""real"" person.

I don't see ""and the nominees for Best Actor are Liam Neeson for Uknown"" in the near future, but at the same time it really is Neeson who makes the entire film work. His honesty as an actor delivers a performance right on the money that kept me on the edge of my seat most of the way, to the point where I really wanted to know how he would get out of this. I never quite fell out of my chair, the way I did when I saw the original ""the Bourne Identity"" with Richard Chamberlain, but ""Unknown"" is first-rate entertainment of the escapist variety.

The two leading ladies also keep the entertainment level high, particularly January Jones (of Mad Men fame) who plays against type, as the loyal wife turned traitor. And Diane Kruger as a Bosnian refugee who is working in Berlin to eventually get her immigration papers reluctantly befriends Neeson and becomes an integral part of the plot. Roger Ebert in his review points out that a lot of things are too coincidental. Yeah...it's a suspense/action movie. So what else is new? If there's anything I can say about ""Unknown"" is you'll never find yourself looking at your watch, which is pretty high praise these days.",1298764800,,3326,4.64176570458404
