1786556,1,B00006LU75,"Although the DVD does show historical footage of Gogen Yamaguchi, the quality is extremely bad.  The faces of the practioners cannot be seen and the colour is dark and running.",1044144000,4,176,4.866666666666666
7972194,4,B00006LU75,"This video is from an old film that was done back in the early 1960's in Japan.  It is taken from a 16 MM film that was sent to various Goju Kai Karate schools all over the world back then and was not seen for many years until this DVD became available.  It features many high ranking goju karate people of the day , performing their art in class settings as well as outdoor training.  It is a fun video for any lover of old time karate.",1285113600,,437,4.0
7972195,5,B00006LU75,"THIS IS A GREAT HISTORICAL ABOUT THE MASTER GOGEN ""THE CAT"" YAMAGUCHI. IT SHOWS BASICS,KIHON, KATAS- ""EVEN THE MOST ADVANCED"" NOT LEARNED BY MANY.
GOOD QUALITY. GOOD FOR REVIEW, COLLECTION, LEARNING.  FRANKLIN PUELLO- SANDAN",1246320000,,224,5.588235294117647
7972196,5,B00006LU75,"I once as a child saw a documentary showing Gogen Yamaguchi training; as we age, childhood memories tend to make people and events grow in stature, after watching this dvd I now know that Gogen was as good as I ever remembered seeing him when he inspired me to take up karate.",1237593600,,276,4.326923076923077
7972197,3,B00006LU75,"I am a Goju practiotner x 2o years. I believe this video does offer historic footage of Gogen Yamaguchi and you can see him personally perform many of the katas on the Goju Kai curriculum. It is inspiring to see him enter the waterfall too. At the end is footage from the funeral where Sanchin is performed by the group. Also 3 karateka perform Seipai, Suparinpei and Kururunfa simultaneously. The cameraman focuses mostly on the Seipai kata performer. Lastly, Goshi Yamaguchi performs Hakatsuru Kata (I believe this may also be known as the Master's Kata Genkaku). Do not confuse with Shotokan's Gankaku. Unfortunately the quality here is very poor. The narration by Mr Alexander is informative. The content is fantastic. The quality should be a little better. A probably must have for one in the Japanese Goju lineage. There is a paradoxical lack of any published footage from Gogen Yamaguchi after this 1960's reel from one of his training camps. Osu!",1199145600,2,954,4.931677018633541
7972198,5,B00006LU75,A truly awesome dvd. It is an incredible honor to be able to watch Yamaguchi perform. I highly recommend this rare historical video.,1170892800,,132,4.782608695652174
7972199,1,B00006LU75,"Gogen Yamaguchi video contains only shadows moving in the dark!

No resolution, no contrast...looking at the same video on internet is much much better! I bought a DVD!!!!!!!!

Completely dissatisfied!!",1168473600,,202,5.7
7972200,2,B00006LU75,"The DVD contains everything that the editorial review promises but in really poor quality. The DVD disc is a DVD-R that the manufacturer reproduced very cheaply and although the cover says that it is digitally remastered, the quality of the DVD is really quite appalling, being very amateurish and in some parts, simply not watchable. Although the content will make me watch it again, I'm really disappointed that I've had to pay so much for something of such poor quality.",1141344000,10,473,4.925
7972201,5,B00006LU75,I have been searching for a dvd with all of the Goju Ryu kata on it so that I could learn and practice them and this dvd not only has them all on it but many of them are done by Gogen Yamaguchi himself. I couldn't be more excited about this dvd. It is amazing.,1089763200,8,260,3.7454545454545456
7972202,1,B00006LU75,"The video's description promises a lot that it doesn't deliver in a usable form.  Granted, the master is taped doing each of the Kata, but the quality is so extremely poor that unless you already know the kata you are guessing at what technique is being performed, much less which kata is being performed.  The video is very grainy throughout and the narrator describes the action as though it is the first time he has ever seen the footage. It is more reminescent of 1930s newsreal footage than a modern documentary.
I will personally not buy any other videos produced by this individual or distributed by this company.",1072396800,3,620,4.731481481481482
7972203,1,B00006LU75,"The quality of this DVD is appalling, and virtually unwatchable. Althought I understand that the footage is old, I had no idea that it would be so bad that it makes most amateur videos look like award-winning examples of cinematography!
It is difficult to see the kata being performed clearly, and due to the absence of audio in the clips (the only sound is the narrator and the funeral scene at the end), the breathing cannot be heard.
The video is blurry, dark and visually ""noisy"".  The funeral scene at the end is so dark, it is difficult to see anything at all.
Don't waste your money",1058745600,10,589,4.5046728971962615
