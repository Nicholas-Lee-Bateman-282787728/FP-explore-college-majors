8486842,5,B005UGXDAI,"MY EXPERIENCES WITH THE FITZGORDON METHOD

About a year and half ago I was have major issues with walking.  I had knee injury in my 20's and as I approached 40 I was having various types of pain.  In fact, it seemed like every time, I corrected for something, I would get pain elsewhere.  If I got my back right, then my ankles would hurt, if I adjusted for them, my feet hurt and then my shins would hurt.  Over the years, I had tried various methods of rehabilitation and incorporated little bits from each, but I didn't have it all together still tended to have issues. I went through so many different podiatrists because I could never get my orthotics made correctly, that I ended up finding a guy who makes orthotics and going to him directly, because I always needed so many adjustments. I also bought the most supportive running shoes I could find and ended up going through them very, very quicker, because I tended supinate --that's the opposite of pronate-- its when your weight rolls to the outside of your foot, and once my sneakers wore out even a little bit at the heel, it wouldn't be very long until I was in pain again.

I remember in particular one day, when I was just walking from the elevator at my job and the brief walk across half a floor of an office building was causing me a great deal of pain.  I even got into what I thought the ""correct stance"" based on the all the bits and pieces of what I had learned and each step was really painful.  I thought to myself,  ""This just isn't working.  Something is obviously very wrong. ""
That's what led me to try and find someone who could correct my mechanics and I ended up taking a walking class with Jonathan Fitzgordon.  Most people don't need to learn how to walk and if I didn't have my knee injury and subsequently gain a lot of weight I wouldn't have had to either.  Prior to my injury I played basketball about 3-4 a week and biked to work for a total about 40 miles a week.  But those days were long gone and I was desperate to find a way to walk without pain.

The class was a godsend and I very happy to report, I walked two miles pain-free the other day.

NOTE:  At the time I took the class, this DVD was under production.  I want to be very clear that I am not reviewing the product itself, as I have not seen this DVD, but I just want to comment on the method and the quality of his teaching.  I just happened to be looking something else up on Amazon when I came across this and wanted to contribute my review.

I took a six-session in-person walking class with Jonathan.  He is a great teacher and uses visual aids very well.  The method is structured in such a way that you gradually retrain muscles until you are back in proper alignment and walking is easy again. Each step builds on the next and you need to spend a bit of time at each stage for it to work as your body is re-learning and re-positioning itself. My class was once a week.  His teaching has that power of blinding insight that once you learn it, it's like you've always known it.  After taking this class, I recognize people with walking issues all the time, just by how they stand.

When I was having trouble walking, a large part of it was do to alignment issues.  After my injury and going from a very active to a very sedentary lifestyle.  My knees tended to point outwards.  If I was looking at the 12 on a clock, my knees would point to 12 and 2.  This alignment issues had been pointed out to me before and some of the other methods I tried, attempted to address this.  The Fitzgordon method was successful for me,because it taking a more holistic approach, looking at the issue of alignment not just in one spot, but the whole body, from the front and the side.  To me it felt like it was addressing the issue in more than one spot and in more than ""one dimension"" then some of the other methods I tried.  It felt more ""3D"" is the only way I know how to put it. I know understood what corrections in my body needed to make and I could do them without pain.  Previously, I thought I was making a correction and standing up straight when I walked, but I was actually badly out of alignment.  Now, my feet face straight ahead and my ankles, knees, hips and shoulders where they should be as well.

When you first begin these exercises it probably will feel very strange at the first stages.  It certainly did for me.  My body was used to my old posture and it was a bit disorienting for a while. It felt like I was ""too forward"" in my body and  My guess is everyone who is in need of the product will go through the same thing. Don't let that discourage you.  You will see the results soon.

Good luck.",1335657600,25,4664,4.227118644067796
