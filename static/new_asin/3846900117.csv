""The Master's Sun,"" has everything,comedy, drama, romance, and horror. The characters were tailored made for this mad cap, wild romp of a ride. I love the way the Hong Sister's managed to include so many different twist and turns into the plot, while at the same time, not losing focus of the main story. This series kept me on the edge of my seat, from beginning to end. Well done!! ""The Master's Sun,"" is one you definitely don't want to miss!",1397520000,5,557,4.365384615384615

7802275,5,3846900117,"I remember a time when I used to watch the all-day Saturday marathon of Ghost Whisperer episodes on TV. This show reminds me, to a certain extent, of Ghost Whisperer. The ghost stories were interesting and touching and certainly kept the drama from any dull moments as far as the Ghost stories were concerned. I'm particularly fond of the ghost story in the first episode because it stirred a sense of real regret and sense of loss for me although the others ghost stories were mostly good as well.

As far as the main story is concerned, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I have watched this drama a few times and for me it lives up well to repeat viewing. I've grown to appreciate the dialogue so much more than I did upon my first viewing because my focus then was more on the story progression. I find the frankness between the lead couple quite refreshing and the hilarity that sometimes characterize their conversations is genuinely funny. I don't watch Kdrama too often because I find they waste a lot of time in dialogue, misunderstandings and useless scenes and they're just not worth the leisure time I have to spare. I think this drama use the time well.

However, in this drama, I feel like the conversations and scenes weren't superfluous and they served the purpose of furthering the story, enriching it, and/or developing the characters. Also important, I find the interaction between Joo Joong Won and Tae Gong Sil quite believable. The honesty of their conversations, even when it's embarrassing from either character's point of view, lends a lot of credibility to their relationship. By the time I finished this drama, I felt that these two truly belonged together in a ""forever"" sort of way primarily because they grew to know each other so well and were so comfortable with each other. In a way, I find it amusing that they made me feel this way when their relationship was far less dramatic than other couples I've liked in kdrama that always had to go through a ton of odds to be together.

Another enjoyable aspect about this drama is the lack of one dimensional poisonous character that normally hinders me from watching a kdrama again. There were no overbearing mother-in-laws, devious and manipulative friends, or just exceptionally bad characters. I deeply appreciated that Joo Joong Won was his own man in every sense of the word. There was nobody forcing him to do anything against his will. He made his decisions on his own. The other characters were also enjoyable to watch. Kang Woo, celebrity Tae, the Vice President and his wife, Tae Gong Ri, the blabber mouth security guard, etc were very likable and I found their parts in the story entertaining. I have an especial fondness for the Vice President and his wife. They're so good together that they're my favorite secondary couple in this drama.

So Ji Sub and Gong Hyo-jin were superb in my opinion. I think it's my first time seeing So Ji Sub act until I watched Ghost but I find his capacity to act was explored and put to much better use in Master's Sun because of the many facets of the character, Joo Joong Won. He was excellent! I think Gong Hyo-jin acting as weirdo Tae Gong Sil was entertaining. lol When she's possessed, she really seemed like an entirely different person/character. I really liked that. I also really enjoyed the chemistry/dynamics between these two actors and the portrayal of their characters.

As to the DVD, the picture quality is very good. However, I was very disappointed to find that the music from the soundtrack were mixed up in a lot of places. For instance, there were a few times when ""You Drive Me Crazy"" should have been playing and the words to the song even comes up on the subtitles but ""Touch"" is played instead on the audio. Something like that is especially noticeable because the subtitles confirm that the incorrect song is playing. The subtitles for the dialogue too at times does not make any sense. Like when Joo Joong Won threatened the manager in the first episode, the subtitles doesn't reflect that although his actions clearly demonstrate it. I think the subtitles are similar to Viki's but Viki's subtitles were better. I subscribe to Drama Fever and I think theirs are the best and makes the most sense story wise and from what is portrayed on the screen. I wanted to knock off a star because of the dvd but did not do it because of how much I enjoyed the story. The packaging and picture quality is good but I'm somewhat miffed that much more care was not given to the music placement and subtitles.

Overall, I highly recommend this drama. The ghosts may be off-putting for some because of the horror-like aspect but the story of money-obsessed Joo Joong Won and insomniac-weirdo Tae Gong Sil is totally worth every second watching this drama.",1425340800,,4782,4.707287933094385
7802276,5,3846900117,This was so much fun to watch last summer on HuluPlus. Now I own it. I can watch it over and over.,1407715200,,98,3.5
7802277,4,3846900117,"It is inspired by The Ghost Whisperer and made into a pleasant and entertaining Korean drama with Korean drama sensibilities. So Ji Sub is so handsome and he is great at comedy with Gong Hyo Jin a perfect leading lady. I liked the fact that it was both episodic and with a back story.

There was a bit of a problem with the development of the romantic angle but that was taken care of as the story progressed.

This is not as good as The Best Love but it is better than many other dramas out there. Give it a chance if you like your romance with a side story of comedy and melodrama in small doses.",1404000000,,598,4.102564102564102
7802278,5,3846900117,"I am sure there are a lot of bootlegs floating around for this popular K-drama title Master's Sun starring So Jisub, and the region 3 version sold on yesasia dot com is probably the best, but this POH KIM multi-region release is acceptable to very good. The English subs are done well and the image quality is quite good, especially if you have a smaller screen HDTV. There are 4 DVDs in the set for a 17 episode K-drama. If they had put it on 6 or more discs the visual quality probably would have been just about perfect, but they didn't, so 4 discs will just give an acceptable to very good resolution, not outstanding. Keep all this in mind in deciding which version of Master's Sun you will purchase for your library. As for the show itself, it is exceptionally entertaining, well acted, about a young woman who wakes up from a long coma with the ability to see ghosts. It was written by the creative Hong Sisters, so you know you will get a good mix of drama and humor. The OST is also outstanding for this K-drama.

I will end by asking the question, WHY oh WHY can't American television give us ANYTHING that is REMOTELY as entertaining as Master's Sun? It's been 15 years since I've watched any American television show because most are just so bad and uninspiring, unromantic and crass. The Koreans KNOW how to entertain you and knock your socks off while doing it. There's a reason Korean dramas have become so popular in the last decade or so, and one of the big reasons is that people in the West are STARVING for good quality entertainment that doesn't insult their intelligence. If you are tired of all the reality show garbage on American television and long for exceptional shows to watch that actually tell STORIES, then Korean television shows are the way to go today. I've pretty much given up on Hollywood.",1402963200,16,1827,4.519637462235649
7802279,4,3846900117,"I really liked this series. It was funny. It was sad. It had some shocks and surprises. I even liked the music and the fact the words to the song are subtitled. The subtitling was excellent. My only complaint was it sometimes ran very fast. I look forward to watching this again. The merchant was great. I received this very fast. This came highly recommended by people who had purchased. I, too, recommend it. It made me laugh and a few times jump in my seat. It also made me sad at times. I found it to be heartwarming as the characters evolved and their personalities changed. Good family viewing. I think viewers of all ages would find something to enjoy. Great cast.",1402444800,,671,4.463414634146342
7802280,5,3846900117,"This DVD was distributed by POH KIM VIDEO.  The English subtitles were excellent. The audio was very good!  The consumer advice lists it as horror but it really is more for the first several  episodes.  I am not a horror movie type person but I saw this on TV and really enjoyed the storyline. It has romance, some horror and mystery. It is one of my favorite K-drama series. Well worth the money!",1399939200,5,397,4.397260273972603
7802281,5,3846900117,"The Master's Sun has as some said: great story line, great acting, great music, you laugh, and the horror part is the best. Gong Hyo Jin is my favorite comedian actress. Probably another of her best dramas is Greatest Love, she is just amazing and Greatest Love is part of my top 5 following My Love From Another Start.  I will save money and purchase this for my collection.",1399593600,,375,4.434782608695652
