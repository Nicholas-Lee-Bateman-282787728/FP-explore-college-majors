The musical score from Naushad Ali is unforgettable, and the songs sung by the late Mohammad Rafi totally awesome. After Mohammad Rafi's death, Naushad Ali was asked ""In your opinion, will India ever produce a better singer than Mohammad Rafi?"" Replied Naushad, ""Yes, it is possible that a better singer might come along, but there will NEVER NEVER be another Mohammad Rafi""!!",1353369600,,475,5.025316455696203
