8362428,5,B002BXGK6C,My 1.5 year old's favorite program - really really cute - very well done.  This is high art for kid programming - leaves me feeling good just hearing it in the background.,1386288000,,171,4.34375
8362429,5,B002BXGK6C,My grandson has been watching this since he was tiny.  He loves Eebee.  Have to say Eebee is a wonderful alternative to Barney or Sesame Street.,1378166400,,144,4.5
8362430,4,B002BXGK6C,"I find the Eebee videos a bit odd, but my girls love that goofy puppet.  And it's mostly music. So it does give you a break from Disney channel etc. The puppet, Eebee, does not speak words...just babbling and baby sounds. I mention this, in case you wanted something educational.",1344729600,,279,4.58
