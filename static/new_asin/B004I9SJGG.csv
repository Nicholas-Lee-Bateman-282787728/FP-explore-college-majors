It's low budget, and some of the dialogue is unintentionally goofy (but I enjoyed the intentionally goofy dialogue!), but it's a REAL movie, not like some of the low budget stinkers a lot of people put out. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're doing some mind-numbing activity while watching it.",1389398400,,333,4.964285714285714
4384864,4,B004I9SJGG,"I expected The Human Trace to be mediocre at best, but I was delightfully surprised with this 28 Days Later - type movie.  In fact, the ending was so surprising, I am going to watch The Human Trace again over Christmas break.  Far from being pseudo-zombie-crap, the direction and acting in this movie were on a par with bigger budget movies.  As I said, I liked this movie so much, found it so original in many ways, that I plan to watch it again.",1385942400,14,447,4.2976190476190474

4384869,4,B004I9SJGG,"I saw this film at a friends house who had the DVD. Being an indie film enthusiast, I like to see various films. Human Trace has amazing framed shots and a good story. Of course the production value is not like Transformers or Avatar, but for what it brings to the table it is a good film. There were a couple times I was spooked. I was wrapped into the storyline all the way through. I recommend this film for those who want to watch a thriller. Check it out.",1341273600,,460,4.122222222222222

4384911,3,B004I9SJGG,"Kyle Fishburn rides his bike into town, after ducking a roadblock set up by the town's police. He shows up at a bed and breakfast as its sole guest.  The B&B is operated by the nice if autistic Gordy Fellows, who gives Fishburn advice to stay away from Sheriff Jermy Sykes - who is a Sheriff of a police department, which is strange in itself.  Fishburn pokes around and is outed by Gordy Fellows as an undercover cop sent in to investigate mysterious deaths that have beset the town, but he has to stay away from Sheriff Sykes.  Fishburn seems to be going through a divorce, but that seems to be filler and the basis for a last minute threat against Fishburn by the mustachio-twirling Sheriff....okay, perhaps, ""goatee-stroking"" Sheriff.

This is an odd movie. I thought it was going to be a murder mystery, but it really is more of an epidemic/zombie movie. The logic of an undercover cop never made sense - if there's concern about a sheriff setting up roadblocks and holding a town hostage, shouldn't the logical tactic have been to send in a SWAT team?  Likewise, I had to wonder about the personnel review that Fishburn would get for endangering the life of the civilian Gordy Fellows. When Fellows is protesting going into the State Asylum for the Criminally Insane, and Fishburn was telling him that they needed to go in, I was wondering, why not leave him outside?  He's a civilian without a weapon, after all.

On the other hand, the plot line was serviceable with a healthy dollop of ""willing suspension of disbelief"" and the actor who played Kyle Fishburn (Josh Sumner) seemed likeable enough to elicit some concern for him as he ran about town on his own being chased by mysterious figures and Sheriff Sykes.  There was some good camera work, but the sound seemed to have a low budget ""feel"" as voice quality dropped off when the actors walked away from the microphone. There was action, and some of it was fun, but, again, this element pushed the ""willing suspension"" meter, as it seemed that Fishburn got punched enough times to warrant a concussion halfway through the movie, and there was one scene where he was handcuffed to a grating and dropped into a pool to drown.  The escape was certainly clever, albeit it seemed like he could have just walked the grating to the shallow end and stood up with less effort, but, well, okay.

Ultimately, I think that this might be ""OK"" fare for a Saturday afternoon if you like mysterious happenings in a strange town with zombie overtones and you aren't expecting much more than that.

But don't over-analyze it.

That way lies madness.",1404518400,,2594,4.6644736842105265
4384921,1,B004I9SJGG,"Spoilers! Interesting mash-up of mental institution horror story and zombies, although the movie is more than half over before you even figure out the zombie connection - then it goes from a few of them to an entire town full in a day. Script seems to have been written by a fourteen year old: lots of build up, disconnected plot lines (the whole divorce/needy-ex thing?) then everybody dies.",1402012800,2,392,4.779411764705882
4384922,3,B004I9SJGG,"The Human Touch is a good movie that contains both likable and unlikable characters and uses a experiment gone horribly wrong for its theme.
The story is about a prison doctor that makes a drug that calms inmates down, but it has some serious side effects that spread among the prision population. I won't say what the other side effects are, but suffice to say its not good for anyone in town. A detective is brought in from another jurisdiction when unexplainable deaths start to occur in the town. Det. Fishburn arrives in town undercover on a touring bicycle posing as a writer and stays at a Bed & Breakfast run by Gordy Fellows. The other lead character was the local Sheriff Sykes (Jeff Wyatt Wilson) who lets just say wasn't really much help with the investigation.
This is a Indie film that has some of the issues that often hurt their stories, but in this case they aren't bad enough to ruin either the story or its characters enough to pull the plug. It had little if any special effects or makeup to add costs and possibly hurt the production further (good call by the production staff) and the story was still effective without it. The main reason I kept watching this story was that I needed to find out what was happening with this town and its residents.
Some of the cinematography was quite good as was some of the lighting used to add a certain creepiness to key scenes.
The acting was rough, but again not so bad that I couldn't watch due in part to the two lead characters Det. Fishburn (Josh Sumner) and the B&B host Gordy Fellows (Jeff Hime) and his idiosyncrasies (obsessives compulsive disorders) that played fairly well off of the detectives personality. Sheriff Sykes (Wilson) did an ok job with his role albeit a little to OTT (over the top) for my liking, nut again not so bad as to quit watching the movie.
The big winner for me was the story itself and how well it plays out on screen. The writing is usually one of the big losers for Indie films much like the acting and direction, but not this time.
The movie could be watched by all family members due to its light touch with violence, blood and gore, foul language and lack of either sex or nudity.
3 solid stars for this one.",1399766400,5,2210,4.45925925925926
