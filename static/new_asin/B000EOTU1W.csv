8112275,5,B000EOTU1W,The final chapter to a GREAT series!,1426291200,,36,4.285714285714286
8112276,5,B000EOTU1W,"Star Trek combines with Battlestar Galactica, literally in a couple of episodes, for a sci-fi action series that makes a lot of other ones look poor in comparison. Kevin Sorbo(Hercules:Legendary Journeys) is the captain of the Andromeda, a curiously Federation looking warship, and I mean this thing is a WAR-SHHHip. Andromeda is Star Trek but with strong Battlestar Galactica style action and gritty undertones. Tier Anasazzi( I know that is probably not spelled right) is the TOUGHEST character on a sci-fi series I have EVER seen. Worf on Next Generation with Captain Picard is a wiiiiiimp-ah in comparison. Lexa Doig is another recognizable performer(Stargate's doctor). Battlestar Galactica's modern version makes a stort cut-in in a couple of episodes which is an intershow crossover which rarely happens in any genre. Also remember that George Lucas helped with the original version of Battlestar Galactica's special effects, even if indirectly or very little. Yes, I hope you are sitting down. Here it comes:Andromeda is Star Trek with a crossover from Battlestar Galactica which had help from George Lucas in the original version which means(here it is!) Star Wars is also involved, although no characters from Star Wars make an appearance in Andromeda. Star Trek Voyager is a similar concept. A large, powerful ship is lost galaxies away with little hope of getting home before natural aging kills them or aliens in their path. Andromeda IS SCI-FI.

8112279,5,B000EOTU1W,"I enjoyed this series when it was on television, and had to add it to my library when it became available on DVD.  The acting is very good, the stories are interesting.  Well worth the price...Kevin Sorbo can play a captain as well as a mythical hero.  The humor is very good as well as the action.",1167782400,,298,4.192982456140351
