8628856,5,B00GZALWVA,"The DVD version of this very enjoyable concert from 2001 was very successful and this new Blu-ray version has been compared to that earlier DVD for the purposes of this review. The recording, although made some years ago, was a genuine HD original and that technical advantage was evident on the DVD and is even more obvious on this Blu-ray edition.

The Blu-ray version of this very successful concert brings a remarkable gain in clarity, both visually and sonically. The venue is the spectacular Hagia Eirene church in Istanbul and the architectural and decorative features, as well as the scale of the building, are well caught by Paul Smaczny and his team with razor sharp imaging, even on the long shots. The colour range is also very clearly portrayed.

The biggest gain, however, is in the sound reproduction which further clarifies the orchestral textures of the music and the players. This is particularly helpful in both the Haydn symphony and the Mozart concerto where the textural disadvantages of the non-period scale of the performances within the resonant nature of the venue has been even more successfully overcome than before. The Berlioz symphony, a large scale composition given a particularly dramatic and exciting reading, is even more obviously a reading of stature in its new format. The complex overlapping textures and rhythms of the concluding pages are precisely and clearly rendered by both the recording and musicians for example. Equally, the echo effects of oboe and cor anglais and answering oboe in the central slow movement, making use of wide spacing possible within the venue, are effective as examples of the more delicate features of the music and recording.

The concert opens with Haydn's 94th Symphony, the Surprise, so named because of the unexpected loud chord shortly after the start of the slow movement. This was reputedly designed to wake up an otherwise sleepy audience!. Haydn's symphonies are more often played by much smaller orchestras these days which frequently make use of 'period' types of instruments. That use changes the sound textures and the orchestral balances considerably. It also makes for fleeter performances than is usually possible with large modern orchestras. It is no small tribute to the BPO to report that this too is a fleet and agile performance and sympathetic to Haydn's period as a reading.

The same Classical period of music with the same considerations applies to Mozart's flute concerto. This concerto may well be more familiar to many as his oboe concerto. Mozart reputedly disliked the flute as a solo instrument and on this occasion made use of the same music for both his oboe and flute concertos. On this occasion the flute version is skilfully played by Emmanuel Pahud, taking a break from the position of first flute with the same orchestra.

The star item of the concert is undoubtedly the Berlioz Fantastic Symphony which receives a particularly fine performance. The answering phrases of the oboe to the cor anglais in the slow movement make the most of the space in the venue by having the answer coming from high up at the rear of the venue. The discipline of the orchestra is a great asset in the last two movements where the rock steady internal rhythms allow for maximum clarity aided by a tempo that is fast enough to be exciting but controlled enough to allow every detail of the complex score to `tell'.

The other star item has to be the recording which overcomes difficult lighting conditions to produce crisp and clear imaging. Paul Smaczny, as producer, ensures that all cameras are spot-on for all musical matters. The sound is astonishingly clear and detailed with lots of low `oomph' provided for the low percussion etc. The sound is presented in DD 5.1, DTS 5.1 and stereo and is a triumph over venue and acoustics.

There are two bonuses - a short `behind the scenes' documentary which is entertainingly involving plus a longer documentary on Istanbul. Both of these bonuses are interesting, particularly the latter, but inevitably it will be for the fine concert that this disc will be bought.

This is one of the most successful of this series of annual concerts comprising of two good items and one clear winner. Only especially committed 'period' music enthusiasts are likely to have any reservations as regards the scale of the first two items given their sympathetic handling and there are simply no reservations whatsoever to be made as regards the Berlioz symphony which receives an outstanding account.

This is a particularly fine recording of a particularly fine concert and therefore well-worth considering for potential purchase. The Blu-ray version offers a clear improvement over the previous fine DVD issue.
