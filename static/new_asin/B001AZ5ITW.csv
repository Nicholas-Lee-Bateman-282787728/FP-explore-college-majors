3475533,5,B001AZ5ITW,"What can I say, Code Geass is my favorite anime....so of course the box set was a must. It is a very well put together anime, and if you like mech suits....it's perfect for you.",1455667200,2,177,4.085714285714285

3475535,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Didn't have Region B listed in Item description, wasted money.
Show is great though just bad seller who doesn't even respond to emails.
Show is worth 5 stars I'm not knocking it down any stars because of a terrible seller.

EDIT: Seller got back to me and finally allowed a return after I contacted amazon. Took over 2 months to respond.",1414454400,,337,4.524590163934426
3475536,5,B001AZ5ITW,"It's a great series and I would recommend it to everyone. Great plot,great story and great characters. I would give it a 9 out of 10",1359590400,,132,4.115384615384615
3475568,5,B001AZ5ITW,Great quality Blu-rays to match this incredible series.,1504915200,,55,6.0
3475569,5,B001AZ5ITW,Classic!,1501804800,,8,8.0
3475570,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Despite being over 9 years since it's initial release, the story and characters do not seem dated.  Although you may notice some common character archetypes, there's nothing so overt that it places into a specific era.
Something to note. The 5.1 and 2.0 Japanese language tracks give you a different experience.  I have the original (US) release on DVD and noted some music differences between it and the 5.1 blu-ray version; a majority of it remains the same so the differences are relatively minor.  There are a couple of scenes that I associate with specific music tracks, that's what spurred my need to verify the differences.
The blu-ray version does have the original 2.0 soundtrack, so there's no need to go purchasing a separate DVD copy.  As far as I can tell, everything in the 5.1 version has already been published and can be heard somewhere in the 2.0 soundtrack.",1498780800,,876,4.82
3475571,5,B001AZ5ITW,"a wonderful set and excellent quality for this set, very compressed tho, and at times the translations subs seem more accurate then in the prior releases, an excellent anime that should be in everyones collection",1498262400,,212,5.085714285714285
3475572,4,B001AZ5ITW,This one takes place right where the first season left off and really meets a whole lot of expectations.,1498176000,,104,4.526315789473684
3475573,5,B001AZ5ITW,This is in my top 10 greatest tv shows of all time,1498176000,,50,3.25
3475574,5,B001AZ5ITW,A great ending season to an already fantastic anime and blu ray just makes it more crisp to look at.,1496275200,,100,4.05
3475575,5,B001AZ5ITW,I love it 1000% just wish it had english subs on the dubbed version,1494806400,,67,3.857142857142857
3475576,5,B001AZ5ITW,"great series but i've had a hard time with this particular dvd in a couple of my players...on my computer i kept getting a ""bad sectors"" message...maybe it's just what i have and i thought it may have been a bad dvd, but this is the second dvd that had the same problem",1494806400,,269,4.09433962264151
3475577,5,B001AZ5ITW,Incredible show. Excelllent blue-ray.,1494806400,,37,8.5
3475578,5,B001AZ5ITW,Great quality and audio,1494547200,,23,5.0
3475579,1,B001AZ5ITW,"The English track of Code Geass Season R2 has faulty mono audio. Later batches may have fixed this problem, if not you can contact Funimation to get replacement discs.

Unfortunately it was not discovered in time that the mono audio problem also extends to the extras on both Seasons R1 and R2. There is mono audio on all Textless Openings and Endings, as well as mono Japanese audio on all Picture Drama and Baba Theater segments. This has never been fixed.

A bonus is that the new R2 Picture Drama from the import Code Geass 5.1 re-release is included, albeit in mono. Nunnally in Wonderland, the new R1 Picture Drama, and the other rare Picture Dramas are not included.",1493164800,,673,4.647058823529412
3475580,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Code Geass is one of those anime series that should almost be a requirement for any fan. The artwork is great, the characters are amazing, and the story is riveting from beginning to end. There is truly nothing negative to be said for CG other than the fact that it had to end. Highly recommended to anyone who hasn't already seen it - this is on that belongs on every collector's shelves no matter the cost!",1490572800,,408,4.381578947368421
3475581,5,B001AZ5ITW,Nice.,1486944000,,5,5.0
3475582,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Basically R2 ramps up the action.  More mecha, more intrigue, and events unfold now on a global scale.  Granted there are more anime archetypes showing up in this season, especially the other members of the Knights of the Round, but that's to be expected.  And there is a part in the middle where CCs character is a bit 'different' (no spoilers) and it doesn't really work for her, yet it's important for her back story.

Otherwise this is about as amazing as an action anime can be.  It has a lighter mecha aspect than, say Gundam - more along the lines of Escaflowne and Guilty Crown - so even my wife enjoys this show - and that's HUGE praise!

The Blu-Ray is amazing.  I do not like the English dub, apparently this is a newer dub... but it pales in comparison to the original Japanese.  So I highly recommend watching in Japanese with English subs.  If you must watch dub, then it's not the worst out there... just really not up to the Japanese.  (So far only Death Note and Dragon Ball Z get my vote for English over Japanese!)

If you enjoyed season one, then by all means, continue this amazing series.

If you have NOT seen Season One, then DO NOT WATCH THIS - major spoilers!  It is a direct continuation of season one, despite the somewhat confusing R2 title.",1486684800,,1270,4.422413793103448
3475583,5,B001AZ5ITW,"I just couldn't get enough.
I love this series! ^-^",1486252800,,51,4.2
3475584,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Great series and everything. Kinda bummed there was only one scene of product placement by pizza. One of the things that made me like the show more of how they shoved the whole cc eating from pizza hut. On a more serious note, it kinda bummed me out that they didn't include the alternate end. Not even as a special feature.",1485043200,,324,4.327868852459017
3475585,5,B001AZ5ITW,Awesome buy it,1484956800,,14,4.0
3475586,4,B001AZ5ITW,"I'd seen season 1 before but this was my first time watching the 2nd season. I enjoyed the overall show a lot still, although I felt this season wasn't quite as good as the first. I still had a lot of fun watching it and I didn't really see the end coming I guess, but it just felt a bit different than season 1 somehow still. Either way I'm glad I can add this to my collection!",1484697600,,379,3.935064935064935
3475587,4,B001AZ5ITW,It's very difficult to find this anime and figure out the correct order and shows to make a set,1483660800,2,95,4.052631578947368
3475598,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Great quality show, had all the things that I wanted in it.  Whether you are a sub or dub person, it is clear that both types were done very well.  For more detailed reviews on this anime, I would suggest to go to MyAnimeList.com and read the more detailed reviews.  As for this as a product, it was presented well, cover slip and all.",1483315200,,335,4.203125

3475600,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Code Geass..both seasons, make for an excellent show. The anime, the quality, the characters, the plot, the story-line, and the art are all amazing. I was eagerly awaiting for this show to come out on dvd and once it did i jumped!! It was well worth the money spent. I loooooooove this show and the characters :)

It is a truly excellent piece of work.",1482278400,,352,4.415384615384616

3475603,1,B001AZ5ITW,"This review comes kind of late since i bought this product a while back, however its just now come to my attention that i received 2 copies of Code Geass season 1 instead of 1 copy of each season like i was supposed to. While the show is great this mix up means that i will likely have to re purchase a copy of the second season since it's past the return window and I now have an extra unwanted copy of the first season",1480204800,,420,3.9529411764705884
3475604,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Its been one year since the Black Rebellion and the death of Zero. Lelouch is living the life of an average high schooler together with his little brother Rolo and.... huh? It seems that Lelouch has completely forgotten not only Nunnally, but also his identity as Zero. Caught in an attack by the Black Knights, Lelouch meets with a mysterious women named C.C., who reminds him of who he is and of his true purpose.....

I was so confused when I started this season. I had to pause the episode and make sure there wasn't an OVA or something I was missing. But explanations come by the end of the episode and we get right back into the rebellion. And wow, the rebellion actually goes somewhere. I had high expectations from the first season of Code Geass, but I was still a little worried about being let down. But no, this season not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. It does have a lot more battle scenes than the first season, but the plot moves right along and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't know the last time I was so excited about a show/movie.

The ending seems to get mixed reviews from most people. I thought it was phenomenally done, but I can see why some people might not enjoy it. However, the series is just too good to miss, so forget about the ending and just watch the show!

This series was originally released by Bandai, which went out of business, so this was out of print for a long time. Funimation has recently done a release of the show. I've heard there are complaints about the audio in the second season, but haven't experienced it myself. There was a report in October that Funimation was addressing the problem, so hopefully it gets fixed soon.",1478649600,,1697,4.4326923076923075
3475605,5,B001AZ5ITW,Great anime story about one teen taking on an Empire with his geass and his battle strategies a must see anime,1478390400,,110,4.285714285714286
3475606,5,B001AZ5ITW,"A must buy, coupled with the first season.",1475539200,,42,4.375
3475607,5,B001AZ5ITW,"If your worried about it not being a complete 2nd season or buying the 1st season. Making sure you get the right stuff. I pre-ordered mine from zias. So if something wasn't wrong about the dvd you could return it.

Yes iv read all the reviews and some are just not true. Speaking to the bad ones only. Some saying it's not worth it or there lying it's fake. Don't listen too them.

Ovreall, I love this anime and can't wait.",1474761600,2,424,4.222222222222222
8280447,5,B001AZ5ITW,"I watched the series multiple times, and i consider this to be one of the greatest anime of all time
Don't be fooled by the art style, this anime is actually dark themed
The story is good, BG music is good, most characters are well developed.",1524182400,,242,4.282608695652174

8280449,5,B001AZ5ITW,4 star personally because it was 10 episodes too long for me. But professionally this was truly a masterpiece. Death everwhere but it was needed to show what peace means.,1520294400,,170,4.7
8280450,5,B001AZ5ITW,I never write reviews but this was amazing and was one of the best shows I have ever seen. I did not say one of the best anime I have ever seen one of the best shows ever period.,1520208000,,178,3.58974358974359

8280452,5,B001AZ5ITW,"Best anime ever!  This is a true masterpiece.  If you like anime with action, philosophy, mystery, strategy, and elaborate story focusing on world domination/peace and sacrifice, watch this anime from start to finish!  If you don't like anime consisting of what was previously stated, watch it anyway.
Remember to start with R1, then R2.  Don't skip ahead!  Don't miss the last two scenes.  It comes together beautifully.
All hail Lelouch vi Britannia!",1519257600,,452,5.208333333333333
8280453,5,B001AZ5ITW,"The Blu-Ray has stunning visuals, sharp lines at all times, and the geass effect isn't blurry. It's everything you'd ever want in the disc version. Just keep in mind that when you first turn it on, Funimation has a one time ad about one of their product that takes roughly five or less minutes to play through, and you can't skip it. Any other time you turn it on, it starts where you left off without the ad again.",1517616000,,415,4.265822784810126

8280456,5,B001AZ5ITW,"I won't say R2 is as good as R1 overall, but it is still great and the ending is by far the best I've ever witnessed in anime, I mean talk about ""Noble Sacrifice."" Still, without giving away too many spoilers, it's a great series to sit down and enjoy, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes darker themed anime that revolve around political intrigue, mysterious plots, and an antihero with a good heart but somewhat contemptible means.",1506038400,2,442,4.5375
