Of course I saw the Habibi clip on Baalbek's site, one of the most exciting live moments on video I have ever seen, and of course I wanted the rest of the show, had to have it, in fact. I am so glad it is finally available on DVD and will post a review as soon as it arrives. I have high expectations.",1369785600,,408,3.755813953488372
