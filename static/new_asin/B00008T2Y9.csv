7986775,1,B00008T2Y9,"Wow. I was approached by George to turn his 3 pages of notes into a 90 min screenplay way back in '85 or '86. I was told the film was to be made for the Hong Kong / Singapore market, so I figured I'd never see it. It was over 20 years later when I finally did see this thing on VHS. WTF?! Unrecognizable! Large chucks of expository dialog have been replaced with improvised in-jokes that no one outside the actors' tiny circle of friends would ever get. Entire story-development scenes I wrote were not filmed and other, nonsensical scenes were created on the fly and shot to fill the time. None of the thoughtfully developed characters remain developed on any level. Woof. What a dog. And yet... they still gave me writing credit. Not sure how I feel about that. Fortunately, there is nothing left in this movie that will cause memory retention upon any accidental viewing. BTW, the original title was ""Paper Dragon"". Not that it matters. I think it had a different title in every country - kind of like a marked man on the run.",1318291200,4,1029,4.449735449735449
7986776,2,B00008T2Y9,"Leo Fong is a legitimate American success story, a noted martial artist, a fountain of optimism, and an all-around great guy, but dammit if he also isn't one of the worst directors ever to helm an action movie. Cynthia Rothrock must have sold a part of her soul to him - that's one explanation for her appearing in no less than three of his awful, awful movies. I suppose when compared against&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/their-previous-collaboration/dp/6302913357/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">their previous collaboration</a>, ""Fight to Win"" isn't too atrocious of an outing, but if any member of the featured cast has a film under their belt that matches this one for a near-complete lack of know-how and cohesion, I've yet to see it.

The story: to recover an ancient statue for his master (karate expert Hidy Ochiai) from the villainous Australian collector Armstrong (Richard Norton,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-Hunter/dp/B00008WJE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City Hunter</a>), martial arts exhibitionist Ryan (George Chung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kindergarten-Ninja/dp/B00022KM1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kindergarten Ninja</a>) must fight for its possession - an encounter he will only be prepared for with the tutelage of the dashing Sensei Lauren (Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>).

George Chung is a real-life compatriot of Rothrock's and a martial arts instructor, but he makes a terrible movie hero: his acting's not great to begin with and his character is written as a whiny dependant who completely falls apart and refuses to train properly when his master is temporarily incapacitated. Nevertheless, he contributes to a veritable supergroup of martial arts stars which also includes Chuck Jeffreys (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodmoon/dp/B000034DDT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodmoon</a>), Master Hee Il Cho (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-3/dp/B00005MM6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 3</a>), and karate legend Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Force-of-One/dp/B00031V23U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Force of One</a>) - a collection whose significance is marginalized by their poor utilization. Chung, Norton, and Rothrock all have largely bad fights, while Ochiai, Jeffreys, Cho, and Wallace barely fight at all. All hand-to-hand battles feature choreography that's generally better than in most of Fong's movies but are still either disappointingly short or surprisingly sloppy. Rothrock and Norton's rematch from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magic-Crystal/dp/B00004CL1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magic Crystal</a>&nbsp;is particularly tear-inducing for both reasons.

The storyline is basic and inoffensive enough but the writing is questionable: I'm not sure whether the characters' frequent attempts at humor were scripted or improvised, but either way it's pretty painful to listen to. The plot takes a nosedive near the end of the film when Ryan and his fellow students legitimately become murderers by attacking and killing Armstrong's hired help when they sneak onto his property to recover the statue which their master already told them wasn't worth fighting for anymore. The acting stinks in general, although I have to acknowledge that Norton and Rothrock have a degree of thematic chemistry in their limited scenes - they simply exchange lines better with eachother than with the other performers. Also, the production obviously wasn't rich but still needs to be taken to task for inharmonious editing: there is next to no ebb or flow to any of the scenes, which are all poorly blocked and ineptly cut.

Golden Globe winner Troy Donahue (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Summer-Place/dp/B000JU8HBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Summer Place</a>) was apparently begged onto the set for the first two minutes of the movie, but his role is an entirely non-speaking one and isn't referenced again throughout the movie. Then again, it's unlikely that he would've been able to save this long-forgotten stinker, so don't be too disappointed. Do, however, be disappointed - as disappointed as I was - that such a collection of talent was wasted on such a bad movie. It's not quite so bad that it deserves a one-star rating, but consider that films *that* bad are usually worth checking out for the sake of it; this one, however, remains rightfully neglected for its almost complete lack of intrigue.",1301356800,,4853,6.797427652733119

Cynthia Rothrock is very hit and miss. This movie misses the mark on many fronts.

Fight scenes not as good as some of her other movies. Still, not too bad.",1237420800,,163,4.225806451612903
