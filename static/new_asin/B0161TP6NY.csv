8735396,5,B0161TP6NY,"This event is their annual singles tournament expanded over three nights (opening round the first two nights with the tournament concluding on night three) with the winner having a future PWG Championship match as it should also be noted that there were various debuts throughout this event as talent from the promotion Lucha Underground was brought in for this event.

Night One:
The first night of the opening round saw Brian Cage faced off against Aero Star in an encounter of ""power vs. speed"" with Aero using high flying offense while Cage showcased superhuman strength which earned him his nickname of a ""f'n machine.""; Biff Busick vs. Andrew Everett in a physical match; Mark Andrews & William O'Spreay both making their debuts faced off in an athletic encounter; Trent vs. Trevor Lee was an evenly matched contest; Drago & Pentagon Jr. didn't even wait for their introductions in a heavy lucha libre influenced match to the point where there were dives to the outside on each side of the ring throughout the match; and Matt Sydal went against Fenix in a highly competitive match that saw both men using each other's offense at various points.  A non-tournament tag match was Angelico & Jack Evans against the Inner City Machine Guns with Jack Evans attempting mind games including a dance off each team having strategies such as using their opponents against each other & double team maneuvers while trying using their opponents offense against them with not every high risk maneuver paying off.  The other non-tournament match was a six man tag match with members of Mount Rushmore 2.0 (Roderick Strong & Young Bucks) against EuroTrash (Tommy End, Zack Sabre Jr., Marty Scurll) that saw some unique offense through double & triple teaming offense along with some humorous moments including poking fun at ""sports entertainment.""

Night Two:
The second half of the opening round featured Marty Scurll vs. Rich Swann; Angelico vs. Jack Evans that saw Evans attempt to pull many shenanigans; Chris Hero & Timothy Thatcher in a very scientific match with both men delivering some stiff strikes; Tommy End vs. Drew Gulak in a heavily mat based encounter; Mike Bailey vs. Drew Galloway in a match that was ""David vs. Goliath"" with Bailey's speed & athleticism against Galloway's power & technical ability; and Ricochet vs. Zack Sabre Jr. in a very evenly matched submission based contest.  Aero Star & Fenix vs. Drago & Pentagon Jr. faced off in a non-tournament lucha libre based tag team encounter.  Super Dragon made his in-ring return for the first time in 3 years teaming with fellow Mount Rushmore members Young Bucks in a Guerrilla Warfare Match against Biff Busick & Andrew Everett & Trevor Lee which saw brawling all over the building leading to such moments as a ""Folding Chair Party"", more than just the legal participants getting involved in the action, and different weapons including chairs & ladders & thumbtack covered Air Jordans in a wild & crazy brawl with an even wilder aftermath.

Night Three:
The second round of the tournament featured Brian Cage vs. Jack Evans that saw Evans ""writing checks with his mouth"" with Cage responding in a dominate fashion with his power; Biff Busick vs. Chris Hero in a physical match that couldn't wait until the opening bell; Trevor Lee & Marty Scurll in a competitive encounter; Zack Sabre Jr. vs. Pentagon Jr. in their first ever encounter that was heavily submission based; Mike Bailey vs. Tommy End in a strong physical match; and Matt Sydal facing off against a man who was inspired by him in William O'spreay that saw them almost wrestling themselves as they were so evenly matched executing similar offense against each other.  Semi-final matches include Jack Evans vs. Chris Hero in a back & forth encounter; Mike Bailey vs. Wiliam O'Spreay in a competitive encounter; and Zack Sabre Jr. vs. Marty Scurll in a hard fought match based off the british grappling style.  The finals was Chris Hero vs. Mike Bailey vs. Zack Sabre Jr. in a triple threat elimination match that had some two on one opportunities such as a double submission & trading off strong strikes in a strong technical encounter.  One non-tournament matches featured a ten man tag match in Aero Star & Drew Galloway & Drew Gulak & Chuck Taylor & Trent? vs. Mark Andrews & Tommaso Ciampa & Drago & Andrew Everett & Timothy Thatcher in a fun encounter with the action ""slowing down"" at the worst possible moment.  The other non-tournament match saw all members of Mount Rushmore 2.0 (Roderick Strong, Young Bucks, Super Dragon) teamed up for the first time against Angelico & Fenix & Rich Swann & Ricochet in a match filled non-stop fast paced action to the point where one move was performed that caused a chant from the crowd never before heard in P.W.G. history.

In the end, each night was filled with quality action with the bonus of all the returns & debuts from talents allowing fresh new matches & different styles leading to this being one the biggest action packed wrestling events of the year that I recommend.",1455840000,,5050,4.879813302217036
