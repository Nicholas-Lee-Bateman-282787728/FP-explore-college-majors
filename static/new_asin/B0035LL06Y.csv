8389124,5,B0035LL06Y,"I have been playing guitar for over 20 years and Marcus Henderson is one of the best instructors I have come across.  Many video instructors (especially celebrity instructors) can be condescending and cocky in their approach to instruction, however, Marcus is neither.  While it is clear that he has a robust knowledge of the instrument and theory, his approach to instruction is friendly and encouraging. He is a fantastic communicator and explains things in a clear and concise manner.  Marcus also excels at making challenging concepts easy to understand. One feels like Marcus is really interested in the success of the student.  He also has a great sense of humor which makes the lessons even more enjoyable.

Marcus focuses on Theory, Technique, Attitude, Improving your playing, and enjoyment of the process.  His discussion of Warm Up's is often overlooked and an extremely important.  I felt as if Marcus was in the room with me helping me to improve my playing and had a vested interest in my success.  While the DVD is geared towards the intermediate player, beginners and advanced players can benefit from his approach as well.  Marcus does a great job of teaching methods to develop your own practice exercises.  His lessons cover the topic while encouraging the student to expand upon the topic.

The format of the DVD is broken down by 7-8 minute lessons and a bonus tuning section.  The lessons are presented clearly with slow and fast demonstrations that include guitar tab, making it easy to follow.  Each 7-8 minute lesson is akin to a 30 minute face to face lesson with a live instructor, making the DVD perfect for a in home weekly lesson.  The advantage is that you can always go back and re-watch an old lesson to brush up or catch something you may have missed initially.

The lessons are:
1. Warm Up
2. Finger Independence
3. Rock Guitar Techniques
4. Legato and Speed Devices
5. Tremolo Picking and Increasing Pick Speed
6. Hyper Blooz
7. Whammy Class
8. Tapping Class
8. Advanced Solo Techniques
10. Zen and the Art of Shredding

In Summary, Marcus is a outstanding instructor with a very personable approach that makes learning fun.  The DVD is formatted very well.  The material is very helpful and easy to understand at all levels and will improve your playing.  The material is presented in a way that is useful to all skill levels.

DVD instruction videos do not get better than Rock Guitar Heroics.",1304726400,,2431,4.826086956521739
8389125,4,B0035LL06Y,"Marcus is an excellent and clear communicator who has cherry-picked a variety of insights and techniques to present that capture the essence of what can only be called ""Effective Rock Moves"". If you're an advanced player you've probably mastered most of these already, but even so it's a great watch because Markus brings excellent clarity to the way he presents techniques and their applications (along with a few bits addressing composition which deserve to be greatly expanded.) Plus, he gives some very important grounding on warmup exercises and thoughts on attitude and personal development that are too often left unsaid in your typical ""Lick 1A: Fast. Now Slow."" instructional videos.

The downside to the video is the nearly total absence of music theory on display - and this is shame, because I'm certain he knows it and would probably be an excellent communicator of this as well. What this can lead to is reinforcing the attitudes of young players who have vast libraries of canned riffs 'n tricks at their disposal, but can't name a single scale or understand how those scales relate to chords and arpeggios. The overall impresion is a (very nice) analysis of the essence of rock 'n metal Style, but that in itself is like talking about the icing on a cake, while ignoring the cake.

Hope to see more videos from the Studio Guy behind Guitar Hero - like Paul Gilbert, he's a very entertaining instructor!",1284595200,,1418,4.8796680497925315
8389126,5,B0035LL06Y,"Marcus Henderson's Rock Guitar Heroics is great for beginners and long time players alike. His delivery of the information is done in a way that is easy to understand and easy to apply, and he adds enough humor into it to make it entertaining as well. I have played for many years and have watched many instructional videos, and can honestly tell you that guitar players (especially good ones) have a tendency to be an arrogant lot. Marcus, however, delivered his lessons in an unpretentious and inviting manner that actually inspired me to want to improve my craft. In fact, my favorite part of the video was the very beginning finger exercises and his reminder that a lot of guitar players fall into a rut and end up playing what they know and are comfortable with all the time...wow...guilty as charged. That little reminder was worth the [...] bucks of the DVD alone to me! My only suggestion to anyone using this DVD is to eat before you use it...because all of his references to food at the end will make you hungry if you don't! Great product and highly recommended.",1270684800,,1073,4.62303664921466
