7970103,5,B00006JDRC,"My 7 year old absolutely loves this DVD. Her face shines when she sings ""Having Fun Isn't Hard, When You've Got A Library Card"". I personally find the Jekyl-Hyde song and the song about Arthur's dad's cooking to be extraordinarily clever. If you like Arthur, this DVD is brilliant.",1131062400,7,281,4.755102040816326
7970104,5,B00006JDRC,"In Arthur's Almost Live,Not Real Music Festival,Arthur and Buster play a not real song in the basement. D.W hears the noise and music in the basement,and Arthur and Buster play a real long music video! That one teaches that you can like something even if it isn't real. In The Ballad of Buster Baxter,Buster has returned from traveling all around the world. Unfourtanetly,Arthur treats Buster really weird,like he and Brain writing a cool adventure book,though before Buster had left with his dad around the world,(his dad is a pilot,and Buster's parents are divorced)he and Arthur had been writing an adventure book too,and Arthur going to the Kresplain club and running away after that,so Arthur,Francine,Muffy and the Brain decide a party. In D.W And The Crazy Bus Song,D.W plays a CD in a boom box,about a hundred times a day,and bothers Arthur with it,but then D.W's CD is accidentely taken by her father. Arthur tries to convince D.W that he did ""not"" take the C.D,but of course,D.W dosn't believe him. But she soon figures out that is was her father,after spying on Arthur a lot,like hiding in a box and hearing Arthur footsteps with a computer disc,trying to steal it,after learning it isn't her CD.That one shows that your greatest thought that has stolen something that your hooked on,may not be the ""actual"" thief.",976579200,3,1325,4.946188340807175
