7984847,5,B00008K79X,Enjoyable dvd.  It was not the version I was looking for; Im looking for the one that ran as a weekly serial.,1515542400,,109,3.9545454545454546
7984848,5,B00008K79X,Good product.,1512432000,,13,6.0
7984849,3,B00008K79X,ok but not the best animated version. originally i was looking for the television series version that ran weekly. this version is o.k. but it was made from used movie stock ... there are the usual old movie copy issues (little white spots and a little jittery - not crisp like new movie). it does follow the verne story. you can see a main character in other covers on site.,1246320000,2,374,4.357142857142857
7984850,3,B00008K79X,GOOD STORY LINE. I ASSUME THAT IT FOLLOWS THE ORIGINAL BOOK AND NOT THE PAT BOONE MOVIE. I WILL NOW HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT.,1198972800,,134,3.8214285714285716
7984851,5,B00008K79X,"This DVD is a ""must have"" for fans of Jules Vernes novel ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"".The DVD[of a 70s film] is much more faithful to the original novel than previous and subsisquant ""live action"" and ""animated"" versions. Just like the original novel 1]the scientists are german 2]the entrance to the volcano is in Iceland 3] there is a sea monster attack 4]the dinosaurs actually look like dinosaurs 5]the scientists  leave the center of the earth by the stromboli volcano. Complaints that the DVD looks ""dated"" is unfair - the film producers did not have access to CGI Technology as todays film producers have-the hand drawn artwork was very good for the 1970s. Give the DVD a try and you won""t be dissappointed.!",1197849600,5,723,4.784
