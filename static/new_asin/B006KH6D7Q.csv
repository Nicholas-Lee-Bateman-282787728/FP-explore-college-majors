5000631,5,B006KH6D7Q,"As a student-made film, with limited to no-budget, this film stands above all the rest. The effects were top-notch, and it's interesting to see a Director do all the writing, editing, effects and music himself too.

The story and feel of the film seemed very similar to ""X-Men"" or NBC's ""Heroes"", but had a twist that was more of a family struggle than a save-the-world struggle. The movie was also NOT riddled with unnecessary language, sex, and drugs. Something that doesn't often happen these days, in the film industry. This movie has the humor, action, effects, and suspense other movies have but for family viewing which is rare.

Bomb Squad could have done with a few well-known actors to give the rest of the cast something to go off of. David Edwards as ""General Ward"" gave a superb performance as the Villain. He was psychotic and crazy; everything he needed to be. Also, Erin Kupay (Bianca Freeman) gave an excellent portrayal of the youngest sister who gains telepathy from her father. The lead character, Keagan Karnes (Cody Freeman) seemed to be a little stiff in the beginning, but quickly became just a quirky character, but his performance really took a turn for the better during the climax of the film, where a stiff performance would have killed the movie. It is the first time his character seems actually concerned and I definitely believed his performance.

What really made this film stand out above the other student/independent films I've seen were the Special Effects. They blended so well with the film, it is hard to imagine an effects company was not involved. The effects of Bianca's Monster, and the duel at the end were what stood out the most. As Director Nick Chamberlin did the effects himself, I must applaud the time and energy he put into it. It must have taken a very long time to do.

The music also stood out a bit to me. It was composed by Nick Chamberlin and had several recurring themes, as a Hollywood Blockbuster would. I am hoping for a soundtrack soon.

Also, with the scene after the credits, Chamberlin teased a possible sequel, which I would definitely watch. With a bigger budget, I would expect a sequel to surpass all expectations.",1335571200,7,2186,4.757255936675461
5000632,1,B006KH6D7Q,"The film opens with 3 men in ski masks (and no gloves) robbing a guarded building of its glow sticks. On their way out they encounter the evil Wraith, a man in a black cloak hoodie and a cheap demon voice echo enhancer...oooooh scary, Darth Maul move over. These guys all have special powers, i.e. stop bullets, create fire, create lightning, and influence people with their glow in the dark contacts.

The movie shifts to 8 years later. Two of the Freeman kids visit super dad in prison and he imparts some of his power to them who in turn touch their siblings who also get power, turning them into a mini ""Fantastic Four"" to the dismay of their doting mother. It is during their visit he recaps the plot, leaving a lot of stuff out so we feign interest. The acting was extremely bad. The plot reminded me of something I saw in an X-Men movie, with Uncle Sam hunting down the mutants. Bianca Freeman (Erin Kupay), who appears she might of had a year of drama studies, is the closet thing to an actor in this film. The title ""Bomb Squad"" is from a virtual game one of the pimply faced boys play. He wanted to call his group the ""Bomb Squad"" with cool, if not meaningless nicknames, but no one else wanted yo go along. So they weren't really called the Bomb Squad except to one kid...but hey what else are you going to call it? ""Stolen X-Men Script"" Who's going to watch that?

The bad dialog, acting, and filler material dragged down the film. These are things that a writer-director has control over and don't cost a dime more. Your ten year old might like it. This film was done by students, most likely Kindergarten.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1334361600,,1648,4.4144736842105265
5000633,5,B006KH6D7Q,"***possible spoilers***
Bomb Squad is a movie directed, written, scored, edited, etc. by Nick Chamberlin. It tells the story of four siblings who discover they have inherited ""super powers"" from their imprisoned father, and that a power-hungry general, set on capturing anyone with super powers, is hunting them. Not only must they escape the evil forces bent on controlling them, but they must also fight to remain a family.

For a movie with an all-volunteer cast and crew, Bomb Squad really shines. The acting is great and the effects are close to what you'd find coming from a million-dollar film. The story is compelling and sucks you in from the start. There are even some pretty humorous parts, especially the scenes with Cody (the main character) and Jerry (his best friend).

There are some frightening scenes/images (fighting, shooting, yelling, etc), so I would recommend watching this movie first before showing it to children. However, there isn't any bad language or explicit scenes to mar this expertly-made film, which is really a plus in my opinion.

Quite simply, Bomb Squad is an awesome action movie, full of smart dialogue, great acting (both from the main characters and all side characters), exciting action, and cool effects. I highly recommend it to anyone. A sequel needs to happen!!!",1333584000,3,1310,5.083720930232558

FX could have used some polish.  Three out of the Four super powers were uninspired, and the fourth poorly executed.  In short, a delightful story that stretches the extremes.

5000653,4,B006KH6D7Q,"Granted there is nothing ""amazing"" in this flick...  but for a Indie / NM Institute ( ie college project ) film, they did a fantastic job...  Entertaining and reasonably suspenseful...

Special effects are sub-par-ish to Hollywood standards, but top of the line for Indie...  and the audio was actually REALLY good...  A lot of indie flicks have a nasty habit of not normalizing their audio, but the team on this one did a good job...  no need to constantly fuss with the volume...  quite frankly, this was better in terms of FX and Audio than a lot of the made for TV Sci-Fi channel flicks...

Acting...  nothing great, but the family was fairly believable...  some of the lines seemed forced and whatnot, but for a low budget flick, it's not like actors have a lot of time to nuance their lines either...

Fun flick...  thumbs up from me...  and probably enjoyable if you like stuff like X-Men or I am Number 4 etc...",1504742400,,919,4.564417177914111

Yes, SYFY movies are usually horrible but I'll suffer through a Sharknado I, II, and III marathon before I would watch this again... SERIOUSLY!....
I mean I went in with some LOW expectations but i was still expecting better acting than a Disney or Nickelodeon show with 10 year old child actors...but I guess that was not meant to be....
Anyways, if I had to rate the actors, then I would have to say that 3 out of the 4 siblings were not totally butchering their roles....HOWEVER, Cody had no such alibi and should be put to sleep (ASAP)...same thing for the mom and the General... those 2 didn't even have their youth/inexperience to blame for their atrocious acting... take those 3 out to the back and stand them up in front of the firing line ASAP... before they try to act again...HURRY!!!
Please save yourself some headaches and heartaches and don't watch this one...EVER!

The plot was great.  The acting 'okay' for the not-for-theatre genre.  This would be a good movie to get a high-budget do-over... Still worth watching if you are multitasking...",1435708800,,378,4.529411764705882

I finally had to turn it off after 15 minutes of poor acting, visual effects, sound effects...  it's like the actors were reading lines from a script with no emotion, it was just really bad.  I've learned after watching too many of these kinds of movies that it really doesn't get better after the first 15 minutes.  I've wasted too many times waiting for the movie to get better, only to arrive at the end even more disappointed than I started out.

5000733,3,B006KH6D7Q,"Like many, I say it is ok.
The good:  Better than Scfy made movies. Special effects were good for a low budget film- better than most made for TV shows.
I hope the students who made this film @ UofNM got high praise.  The movie was one of the best low budget films I've ever seen.
And unlike TV or most films, I appreciated the producers not feeling the need to follow main stream ideas that a movie must have sex scenes and filled with bad language.  This movie kids will like and parents won't mind them watching it.  That alone is a great achievement in my book.
Nothing truly bad with this movie- just some flaws.
Acting was good for a low budget film.  It's just that it mostly lacked true emotions.  How would you react in your HS years or early twenties if you found out suddenly you had a special power is just one point to consider.
The General orders double security on the facility which is never seen when it interfered with the plot.  Army guys with goatee's, earrings and mouthing off to superior officers did not help.  And having a secure gov't facility housing dangerous 'criminals' easily breached by simply throwing an electrical charge @ the control panel is weak- especially since the gov't already knew this power existed.  But probably the worst was THE most dangerous criminal in the world locked behind a single password that a HS girl figured out on her first try........
Overall:  Story good overall.  Acting OK.  Special effects great.  This movie is not for everyone, but is probably one of the best low budget Sci Fi movies you'll ever see.",1426982400,6,1570,4.544483985765124

The actors all played their parts exceptionally as would be expected of people in real life of the same age groups. I wish I knew how much money was in the budget for this production. I have to give it a rating of 5 stars because I can tell a lot of work went into the creation of a realistic environment and all the special fx used were well above what you would normally see inv ery low limited budgets. Fortunately, there were only two characters in the cast that truly belonged in a ""below the bottom shelf B movie"" because of the lack of any acting ability. Of course the way the two actors portrayed themselves for their character roles, I would venture to say they (the General and the mother) are probably pros at bad acting in real life.

I liked the story line and even the cliff hanger at the end giving hope for a sequel because if there ever is, I'm going to watch it.

Some of the negative reviews, such as how fast they've learned to use their new powers, are no different than other movies of this type. They do practice, it shows and movies are typically two hours or less and the timeline is never given so the audience has to give some leeway. It's no different than any others of this type or comics, graphic novels, etc.

I think they did an excellent job, the whole crew. No one was paid to do this and yet, it shows that they had their hearts in it. I'd watch it again and recommend it if you are in the mood for a Saturday matinee.",1409443200,,1002,4.186528497409326

I love how he shoves his gun down his pants instead of using a holster.  Every time I see one of these low budget movies, I wonder why they waste money making them.  These people could pool their resources and make one movie that could actually be worth something and maybe even get released in theaters.

5000785,4,B006KH6D7Q,"Aloha,  Here's my ratings:

Special Effects:  5+ (STARS)I was surprised at how well the special effects were for this movie with a 'volunteered' & small budget.  The scenes where the dad shows off his abilities... and the 'dark' character WOW!

Acting 3 (STARS):  There's a difference between reciting your lines and acting them.  People need to be more realistic conversationally.  You can actually watch many actors' facial expressions as their mind is reading off the lines to the mouth and the eyes give it away.  Everyone had their moments though. (except mom...sorry)

MUSIC WAS AWESOME!!!!!!

Potential 4 STARS (There's always room for improvement, yes?):  Remember my friends,, this movie was written and brought to fruition by A FAMILY!!!  In actuality, I think that aspect alone 10+ STARS!!  There's a lot of potential here.  I'd really like to see what happens next... you have my interest peaked.  If you've made  book from this, I'd definately read it.  As far as the film in its entirety, younger kids would LOVE this movie.  I do agree with some of the constructive criticism about the military depicted in this film.  Hair was too long, uniforms, facial hair and the salute... YIKES!  Also, as a former MMA fighter, you really needed to choreograph the fighting scenes better.  The military should know how to at least get into a fighting stance and hold their weapons.  (but the hallway scene where one of the boys said, ""Don't do that again...""  funny! LOL)

I liked it.  If you consider a sequel,, you should touch on the Angels with 'powers' and God's 'gifts' given to humans a lot more...",1401840000,,1609,4.866666666666666

5000787,3,B006KH6D7Q,"Ok, so the movie isn't bad. It's really not. Obviously its not professionally made. Clear from the get-go (made by Creative Media Institute, or some such place). The powers CGI is solid, for the budget they had to work with, gets the job done, and the actors do a fairly good job of portraying the powers they have with more than likely nothing but a few tips and their imaginations to work with. So overall, a decent movie. Golf clap worthy...

...here's where my rating of three stars really stretches to try and fit that description: the military aspect. This is a low-budget film and not everything can be just right. But as a veteran, I cannot recommend this movie as faithful depictions. The research wasn't too thorough, or perhaps they were trying to avoid any future problems. In any case, the things I found to be the most distracting and detracting from the movie were: Many of the ""military personnel"" in the film had hair WELL out of regulations. Long, three or four inch hairlines on males, facial hair FAR too overgrown to be just ""forgot to shave that morning"". Lack of covers (hats) when walking outside, a basic requirement DRILLED HEAVILY into all recruits. Holes the size of my pinky in earlobes, something NO military member, no matter how high ranking, can get away with. Lack of nametapes, rank, badges, stripes, etc. on military uniforms, which as I said earlier, might've been to avoid conflict. All kinds of airsoft weapons, some not even U.S. military-issued lookalikes. The FAMAS was a predominant visitor, never once seeing the M16 or M4 (main primary weapons of the U.S. military). Uniforms were mismatched as all get out with several actors, sporting several pieces for other nations' armies. And finally, THAT FRIGGIN SLOPPY SALUTE!!!! Oh how that killed me to see the hand loose as a unfurled flag drawn not ramrod straight to the point of contact, thumb waving all over. GAH. Ok, I'm good now

In short, ""ok"" movie, but no veterans can watch and enjoy it, without yelling at the screen. Thank you",1400112000,,2030,4.764204545454546

I think the negative reviews come from people who were expecting something much more than what this was.

OK, it was extremely low budget, but I have seen similar privately done films that led to a second film, and then a third, and before long the movies were being shown in theaters and picked up by major film companies. I almost turned it off at the beginning, but it drew me in just enough to keep watching, and it got better as it went. Yes, the special effects don't measure up to the multimillion dollar productions, but they were a lot better than some of the B Grade movies I have seen - and if you grew up watching things like the original Godzilla films they may make you a little nostalgic. Overall, I enjoyed it. Watch past the credits and you will find a teaser for a sequel. If there is one I will watch it with interest.",1397260800,2,860,4.155688622754491

This was reviewed by others as a piece of garbage, but  I found it entertaining. I found myself drawn in by the characters, the occasional hokey dialogue, the brother/sister bantering. The special effects were better than ""Sharknado"", ""Sharktopus"" ""Megalodon, the flying shark"" and scores of others. I thought it was interesting that the the script was penned by a plethora of ""Chamberlins"". Family effort payed off in my mind.

Perhaps too the fact that none of the high school kids looked like kids . . . The teacher looked like a kid.... get people who look the part, and put them in the correct roll.....

Over all, all things considered, it was fairly decent border line B/C movie.  A part 2 would make it to my watch list just to see how well they can fix/kill the story....",1389744000,,586,4.060869565217391

Second YES THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE.
Third YES THE PRODUCTION QUALITY IS LOW.

Now ALL THAT SAID I loved Bomb Squad. The story is nearly great. The roles make sense. And best of all, the superheroes are slightly-off center. This is what Stan Lee aims for even to this day.

There is just too much to like about Bomb Squad. It takes all the ordinary superhero tropeskids getting powers, adversaries who are military, next step in evolutionand reworks the recipe into something homespun but excellent.

While the actors were clearly friends who came along for the ride and director was far more interested in getting the story across than drawing out range from the cast, the story is so strong that it carries the entire production. In fact, by the story's end, Bomb Squad's production quality becomes part of its attraction: I knew how it was going to look, I just wanted to see how it was going to unfold.

With that in mind, the sound was good and the special effects were phenomenal, and surprisingly much better than some of the higher funded sequels to some well-known Hollywood films.  The credits mention **unpaid volunteers** for cast and crew!

There are some small problems with the story, but nothing that couldn't be further explained or worked out in a sequel or series. The acting was hit or miss, depending on the particular actor and scene, with some being awful enough to disrupt the flow and others doing a good job (Craig Beeman, who played Will, and Erin Kupay, who played Bianca, provided some of the best in the film).  If you can go into this remembering that it is not a big budget top tier production, and accept it for what it is, you will find yourself entertained, especially if you are into 'superhero' stories.  I would love to see this go into sequel or series with a higher budget and more experienced actors.

The story has been done before, but you can't blame indie filmmakers trying to get some work done. Bomb squad is more of a bomb, that lacks a lot of squad (the pieces that would make this film as a whole, a good one).
