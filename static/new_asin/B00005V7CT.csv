It`s a clever mistery movie! It`s funny, romantic, misterious, and clever. For the cute boy lovers you have Ryan Phillippe. For the Mystrey lovers, you have the movie. For the Humor you have all of the peronalitys clashing. It`s Fabouluse!!! You can`t miss it. It`s bassed after the 1920`s. With maids and servants clashing ith the couples, actors, and job seekers. When people come to gether for a shooting weekend. When someone is killed, twice. You have to see it or even buy it!!!!!!!!!!!",1018396800,4,554,4.663265306122449
1672415,5,B00005V7CT,"Altman, now in his seventies, is in the twilight of his career, and Gosford Park is the beautiful culmination of this master filmmaker's effort; that says a great deal considering a body of work spanning three decades full of experimentation, risk, and breathtaking results. Gosford is easily one of his finest achievements. Altman's love of filmmaking and, in particular, actors, is on rich display here; Gosford Park is an enchanting, gorgeous gift from the Movie Gods and a true swan song... a man who has given back so much to American film making over the past decades. It makes one wonder what these awards stand for. Altman is one of Hollywood's most talented artists - ..., it would start polishing his lifetime achievement award for next year.",1018310400,3,752,4.929133858267717
1672416,5,B00005V7CT,"In Gosford Park Robert Altman sets himself an almost impossible task, and pulls off what might be The Perfect Movie.  This one has it all: drama (both high and low) and comedy, sex and violence, incredible beauty and vile human ugliness.  It has a script that one would think some mid-level executive in Hollywood would have squashed as being more story than could be told in two-plus hours, and it probably needed a Robert Altman both to get the green light for the project in the first place and then to actually pull it off.
The setting is a large British country house in the '30s, and the plot centers around the house residents and several wealthy guests and all their servants at the house for a weekend of hunting.  Immediately the house is divided between the nobles and the servants, and much of the next two hours' interplay involves this distinct class difference.  The guests interact with the house residents and the other guests, while the visiting servants are accommodated by the butler and head housekeeper and head chef of the house.  The nobles come downstairs occasionally to give instructions, and the servants are quitely everywhere as the nobles discuss all their dirty little secrets (and make some new ones).  All the doings upstairs are duly scrutinized and analyzed by the servant corps, and alliances are formed and fall as events unfold.
This all requires a very large cast (and he could not possibly have cast better--there are too many standouts to mention) but Altman begins with Maggie Smith and her maid and driver, to set the tone and to introduce a pivotal character, and also to ease us into what will shortly be a very hectic scene.  We meet a few others as she makes her journey, and she arrives at the house to join the fray.  Each character plays a vital part in what begins as a huge and confusing puzzle, and each little story and subplot is essential to the fabulous, three-dimensional whole that is, almost miraculously, birthed at the end.
But that intricacy places some demands on the viewer; indeed, the most common criticism I've seen is from viewers who wander innocently into the fray and never find their way back out.  It's a movie that requires rapt attention at all times, but it rewards us by leaving us stunned and breathless not for the body count or special effects but simply for the sheer virtuosity of the story-telling.  That he actually pulls it all together in the end is a bit like watching a vaudeville juggler who keeps 18 plates spinning while singing an opera aria and balancing on a beach ball with one foot: you're convinced A) that it can't be done, and B) that even if it CAN be done it won't be accomplished this time!  The first time I saw it I was wowed but left the theater still wondering about a couple of the characters.  The second time it made much more sense, but I think there are discoveries aplenty to be made by further viewings (which will have to wait for the DVD)!
Movies are about story-telling, and about the human beings in those stories.  No special effects budget can take the place of great writing, or of a substantial idea well-executed.  But maybe if movies like this are becoming rarer (though it's been a good year for movies) it makes one like Gosford Park stand out from the hail of bullets and reminds us what great story-telling really is.",1017878400,22,3346,4.6395939086294415
1672417,1,B00005V7CT,"P>In this film however, it completely fell apart. There was no storyline and nothing to keep my attention. It seemed that all it was was Altman playing around and having fun with his characters in a scenario, like a child playing with a doll's house. He has received acclaim for this approach, but in GP this technique comes accross as pure laziness with no respect for the time the audience is giving up to watch it.
True there were funny moments in a typical - but less successful - MASH fashion where amusing events, comments and body language came at quite a witty pace. Maggie Smith did a good job at portraying her snobbish character and I could see how Stephen Fry was trying hard to push the film to a more entertaining height whenever he could. But that was still not enough to make this into a good movie.
All that happens is a bunch of people come together in this big house, they are characterised for over an hour and then one of then is murdered. The rest of the movie is just people wandering about with their own little dis-jointed cameos. The only way the murder is ""solved"" is that the same particular maid overhears a bit of information during the course of a gossip and then goes and talks to the murderers in a typical pathetic ""why did you do it?"" fashion. Nothing happens in this movie that you can't get by watching a poor episode of Inspector Morse.
Watching it, I also felt insulted. A movie all about British folks having a jolly good shoot in the country would never have become this big without the missing link: an american in the cast. Sure enough, there he was. Amoung all the British cast, there had to be at least one american to make it sell(in fact there were two). There was no logic to their appearing in the film. I could see right past the whole scheme and it made the movie all the more stupid.
...and this has been nominated for Oscars???? What is wrong with this planet today? Why the heck has this film become so
successful? Is it the cast? The famous director? Bribes? Or is it that the flimbsy nature of this movie is enough to appeal to the lowest common denominator amoung mainstream audiences? There is this assumption among people today that if they don't understand something then it has to be extremely intellectual. Sometimes that is true, but not in this case. I know that there have been many terrible movies that have been made into big successes because of being popular amoung a simple audience, but even this movie fails to deliver ANYTHING to appeal on ANY level of interest.
Pointless, Stereotyped - and above all - BORING.
That's my summary of this movie. I'm not an action movie junkie who finds quality, subtle movies boring and then writes reviews like this to slag them off. I actually look critically for good movies with some enriching insight. This movie simply has no content. That is undeniably the case and I expect lots of people to click the ""no"" on the helpfulness counter above the review so to try and punnish me.
Please resist all the unexplainable hype. Don't watch this movie and certainly DON'T BUY IT - money is far more valuable.

I am very disappointed. It was a waste.",1016841600,32,3153,4.5122377622377625
1672418,5,B00005V7CT,"Altman followers will have no trouble seeing in ""Gosford Park"" the auteur's favorite themes and devices--a preoccupation with time and place over ""story,"" an intersecting repertory of actors whose various characters are subtly and gradually disclosed through their interaction, protracted shots with significant visual information planted in all corners of the screen, an audio track characterized by overlapping dialogue and multiple conversations.  Add to all this Altman's respect for actors who contribute their own ideas to the script and his ability to seize and incorporate the serendipitous, and the results can be purely exhilarating cinema.  At its best (""Nashville""), Altman's approach produces films that imitate and criticize life like few others, evoking spinetingling epiphanies during the film experience and indelible memories afterwards.  At its worst (""Ready to Wear,"" ""Kansas City"") the results are little more than tedious, meaningless exercises in cinematic self-indulgence.
What distinguishes ""Gosford Park"" from much of Altman's previous work is the director's exercising of a much firmer hand over the proceedings.  Altman usually eschews film scores, preferring to go with source music (""Nashville"") or no music at all.  ""Gosford Park,"" on the other hand, is a heavily scored movie, a device that insures narrative form and plot continuity not to mention a ""melodramatic"" heightening of emotion felt by both characters and spectator.
To describe the film as a satire on the crumbling of residual, anachronistic aristocratic values and class distinctions in the 20th century is to do it injustice.  True, Altman uses social distinctions, new  vs. old money, master vs. servant class, Hollywood actors who play roles for a living vs. the served and servants who live because of their roles.  And he throws in stereotypes of plot and character that somehow work--enlivening the proceedings while drawing both the satire and more subtle characterizations into sharper focus.
But Altman's satire on class, British culture, and literary and film genres themselves are all merely vehicles for his exploration of characters, of their dreams and desires, and above all the consequences of repressed and thwarted desire.  If there's a flaw in the film, it's Altman's failure to bring out the degree to which even the most ""liberated"" of characters fall prey to their freedom.  ""Gosford Park"" leaves us with the picture of a servant class making touch with its own feelings, daring to imagine a life of expressed desires and personal happiness as a consequence.  Only the stinging depiction and indictment of the ruling class carry any hint that personal freedom has its own liabilities.
""Gosford Park"" is not the epiphany that ""Nashville"" is, but it's a brilliant cinematic house of mirrors, casting reflections and meanings that can only multiply upon repeated viewings.",1015804800,6,2887,5.47972972972973

1672435,3,B00005V7CT,"This has the look and feel of English ""who-done-it"". It is as much the society as it is a mystery. The first quarter of the movie is just introductions to the characters as they approach the manor. Then the discussions start as they are settling in and the sub plots show up but do not overwhelm the main story. If you are trying g to guess ahead forget it. Also plan for every English clich.

I suggest that you use the closed caption option the first time through as the mumble a lot and the background music is louder than the speech tract. Don't be surprised to find that it has ended just as you are getting into it.

The DVD extras add a dimension to the movie as after watching them you can view the movie with out the sub tittles.",1507248000,3,738,4.190140845070423

That's the only criticism I've heard, actually: that the set-up to the actual mystery being presented takes so long.

Also, I was never able to relate to any of the figures in the film, and the ending was no surprise, either. I should have stuck to my first impulse upon seeing that Robert Altman was the director and not order it.

1672556,5,B00005V7CT,"One of Altman's last, and best, efforts, he takes on the British murder weekend drawing room mystery, with his own spiky flair. Yes, there's the overlapping dialogue, multiple storylines and long takes with a dancing camera, but Altman doesn't avoid genre conventions entirely. He is helped, immensely, but a perfectly top drawer cast led by Maggie Smith, Kristen Scott Thomas and Helen Mirren all in top form and a host of familiar faces both upstairs and down in a sprawling country estate.  The conceit is the visit of an American film producer scouting ideas for his next Charlie Chan picture, tagging along with Ivor Novello, a nonfictional expat who was actually a singing and composing movie star. Much of the rest of the fictional goings on are supplied by Julian Fellowes, honing his craft into the ideas (and several cast members) that will lead to Downton Abbey. If Altman loses the thread of his mystery along the way, it's only to make a droll point about poor detective work and the industriousness of people trained to keep secrets. Immensely entertaining, and layered with loads of interesting goings-on that require both the rewind button and multiple viewings.",1481155200,4,1178,5.010204081632653

Little attention is given to who killed him, focusing more on the social and personal derogatory conversations between characters and against other's. I think this is not a movie for those who bore easily of dialogue as main content, as the context of character dialogue, is, which I found comical and perceptive of the mores of this class of society, having the same weaknesses, fears, and failures, as the rest of society.

Seemingly every major actor/actress whoever appear in an English production or PBS show was part of the cast of Gosford Park. Unfortunately, by and large they didn't seem to be committed to the production, i.e., they were just going through the motions, to pick up their paycheck. Moreover, there are a multitude of characters in this story, and it seemed that they were introduced at a frenetic pace, leaving me to try to figure out who was being referred to in much of the dialogue. The net effect of these (and other) shortcomings left me with the disappointed opinion that this was tiresome.

When Helen Mirren chased after Clive Owen and then you saw a picture of his Mom next to his bed, you knew she was his Mom; and the head of his house was his father, because of his womanizing with the help. It was also obvious head of house would die.
I hoped this would be a secondary plot, not the main reason for the murder. The writer would benefit from reading Agatha Christie novels.",1475020800,,471,4.075268817204301

The beginning is daunting, there being so many characters, you have difficulty keeping straight who's who, and who has what motive, forcing you to backtrack multiple times.  But it is very worth your effort, and if you review the first half of the movie after seeing it through once, you appreciate the depth of the acting and the script.  So 4 stars, but I must admit that after the first half hour, I almost gave up out of sheer annoyance at the effort you have to invest to keep things straight.",1473811200,,560,4.314285714285714

my star rating is soley based on the BluRay - not the movie.

I have never encountered such a minimalistic blu ray - did not even occur to me to confirm it would have a menu.

really. NO MENU.
movie just starts.
no menu = no way to select a chapter also no way to review and then select chapter during movie other than skip through the cheaters.
no subtitles. for a dialogue-heavy (with a lot of under-the-breath conversations) and coupled with different accents I was really looking forward to subtitles.
no special features

only ""pop-up"" option you get is the audio and language (English or French). French does not have subtitles - just dubbed over in French

one review mentioned color seemed dark. it is a somewhat dark-toned movie but mine seems fine.

for an academy award winner you would think the Blu Ray would have the basics and then maybe some special features/inside look/sneak peaks.

sadly not this one. what a let down",1471132800,3,978,4.618497109826589

In addition to having great actors, a great set and an interesting, dramatic story line, it contains a very neat mystery evocative of Agatha Christie at her best. Much of it written by Julian Fellowes who later became the chief writer of Downton Abbey, the story captures the sense and breadth of both that series and the Upstairs, Downstairs series (which Fellowes also contributed to) but in a greatly condensed form. Robert Altman's best film with wonderful performances from Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Clive Owen, Charles Dance, Jeremy Northam, Kelly Macdonald, Stephen Fry, Kristin Scott Thomas, Bob Balaban, Derek Jacobi and many others.

1672976,2,B00005V7CT,"Let me preface this with the fact that it has only been a couple of weeks since the final episode of Downton Abbey, which I watched faithfully for 6 years. I had heard Julian Fellowes and some others associated with DA mention this movie as a sort of springboard for DA. I was not expecting ""Downton Abbey II"" (since this movie takes place in 1932, 4 years after the last DA episode), once I saw the opening credits because they were fairly ""American"", with some American actors, an American director, and probably some measure of American production.
Nevertheless, I found it boring and didn't watch it for more than 45 minutes or so. At that point, neither [the great] Helen Mirren or Maggie Smith had stood out much at all. Was I spoiled by Downton Abbey? Probably yes. Others should give this movie a chance because, on paper, the cast names are fairly impressive.",1459209600,,868,4.642857142857143

1673002,4,B00005V7CT,"This is a quirky film. It is nothing like what you might expect, but it is everything it needs to be.

Without giving away anything, let me say this is NOT a British film. It is an American film masquerading as a British production. And as such, I have a few issues, not the least of which is the use of a certain ""F"" word. In truth, while this word may have been in use in the pre-World War II world, it was not in common use - and certainly not in higher societal use. Granted, the only person using this word IS an American character. Nonetheless, it was disruptive and, in my view, out of character for the times being portrayed.

The plot is basically about a gathering. And what gathering would be complete without a murder? Well, then, with that settled, it becomes a ""whodunit"" and ""whytheydunit"".

The dialogue, which is where this film shines, is wonderful (but for the aforementioned inclusion). The costuming is very good, too. The ""unseen"" dcor and setting creates a rich visual backdrop, very critical to immersion in the time period and setting. The acting is richly done, even though we know little about the actual lives of the people - except that they are functionally either very wealthy (or used to be), and that they are low born or had fallen on hard times and were now servant class. So this really is less a character study than it is a slice of life covering a weekend at a country estate in England somewhere outside London.

The subplots are not fully developed, nor should they have been, really. But we learn things, and we grow to understand things... but those things are generally just window dressing to the greater whole, to give it ""substance"" and ""depth"", both of which are not really the object of this story... except.... ah, but that would be telling. And, since we are seeing the servant's view as well, it is gossipy, which might not interest the viewer.

But overall, if you are a fan of Robert Altman, you will probably enjoy this film.

So, why not five stars. Well, the inclusion of the one word is part of it. The pacing of some elements also were a bit off and interrupted the flow. And at least one of the subplots, such as they were, was entirely pointless.",1459209600,,2207,4.491271820448878

It's like an intricate clock -- watching each little movement and how each movement informs another.  The plot is very intricate.  It's like Downton Abbey, only the seedy underbelly.  Like people really are, not how they are imagined to be in a perfect world.

I was so excited to watch it and then quickly let down. This movie had almost as many characters and subplots as Downton Abbey, but only 2 hours to resolve it all.
Too many characters to keep track of. Dialogue quick and hard to follow. Too much going on. Plot resolution would have been more satisfying had true identities been revealed between the two key characters. Over all, not what I thought it would be.",1458000000,,557,4.636363636363637

The downstairs staff had better acting and better lines, while the upstairs elite were quite boring and were typical snobs - nothing surprising.  You get the feeling that the movie is obviously trying to give you hints on ""who dunnit"", but it would probably be easy to solve for some viewers.

1673237,4,B00005V7CT,"This kind of thing is ok, if you are an Anglophile  fascinated by the early 20th century goings-on in the stately homes of England.  At least in Gosford Park we get to see a little more of what goes on below stairs.  As the Crawley family saga has (finally!) drawn to a close in Downton Abbey, and as ""The Shooting Party"" and ""The Remains of the Day"" are seldom-watched but very good films from which these two later productions were hatched, maybe we can, for a time, bid farewell to the era between wars, which was the last hurrah for the stately home crowd.  Except for the Windsor/Cambridge clatch, that is.  Britain has moved on, many of the stately homes had to be torn down because death duties were so steep in the post-war period, and anyone lucky enough to have even a cleaning lady in Britain today is doing very well.  But, that doesn't detract from Gosford Park is a reasonably good film, and nice escapist viewing.  Of course most of those viewing it, oddly enough, identify with the upstairs, not the downstairs, but that's the whole point of escapist movies.  It should be remembered that while the uppah clawsses were dressing to the nines and having trivial problems like a problem son being sent down from Cambridge, Welsh miners were starving and most Britons were living hand-to-mouth as the world lurched toward World War II.  The aristocrats comprised only a tiny fraction of the population, or as Mark Twain put it, exemplified ""The rule of the infinitely weak over the infinitely powerful.""  That has all gone away now, and we view the stately home phenomenon through the rosy mists of time.  We forget that the servants  often worked 16 hour days, had half a day off every two weeks, and in some homes, maids were forbidden to marry or even keep company with their admirers.  In reality it was a cruel system of haves and have-nots, the latter outnumbering the former by tens of millions.  But movies are mostly fantasy.  That's why we pay to look at them.",1456963200,,1982,4.622857142857143

1673271,4,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is an excellent film that is part murder mystery, part comedy, and part drama about the lives among the British aristocracy and their servants in the 1930s. It stars, among others, Kelly MacDonald, Clive Owen, Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, Michael Gambon, Ryan  Phillippe, Bob Balaban, and Stephen Fry. The film was written by Julian Fellowes (Downton Abbey) and directed by Robert Altman (M*A*S*H).

A group of British aristocrats, American movie-makers, and their servants all converge at the country estate of Sir William McCordle for a weekend shooting party. McCordle , a self-made millionaire, is loathed by his wife, daughter, nearly all of his guests, and several of the servants. He spend much of his time during the weekend completely alienating nearly everyone he talks to. Sometime during the second evening, he turns up dead, the victim of a murder. Whodunit? Thats the job that Inspector Thompson, a slightly bumbling police Inspector, must find out

Gosford Park is a marvelous film from start to finish. It clearly shows the great divide that existed between the British upper-class and their servants. Its also a wonderful, witty murder mystery, filled with many moments of humor. It has many elements that derive from books written by Agatha Christie. Although theres precious little action in Gosford Park, the writing and acting are so good, and the story so interesting, that the film remains fascinating throughout its two-hour runtime.

I originally purchased Gosford Park on DVD, but decided to upgrade to a high definition version of the film. As a result, I purchased a copy of the film on Blu-ray disc, which turned out to be an import from Canada. I found myself somewhat disappointed by the overall quality of the video and audio quality on the disc, although I must say that they are still vastly superior to whats found on DVD.

1673363,3,B00005V7CT,"I know this movie won many prestigious awards and was the forerunner for the fabulously successful TV series ""Downton Abbey"" so how dare I not rate it all 5 stars? It is a typical British movie, intended for audiences that are more patient, who care very much about manners and have enough knowledge of the British culture to appreciate the many, many fine and sometimes very subtle details. The very heavy emphasis on the class differences between the wealthy (not aristocratic) and the servant class is heavy-handed.

The main reason for rating this movie only 3 stars is the excessively long and slow first hour. So many different characters were introduced, each with a bit of gossip about them, but no clue as to who is important to the story of the movie. Added to the seemingly trivial dialog, I waited for 'the movie to begin.; For American audiences, of which I am one, this just takes too long and is too boring. I prefer to know what the plot is and who the main characters are in the first 20 minutes.

The second reason I did not rate this movie to be 5 stars is the denouement is weak. SPOILER ALERT It turns out the motivation for the murder is the wealthy class (as distinguished from the aristocratic class) exploiting the serving class. Also, typical of an older style mystery novel, the relationships between characters that seemed unrelated for the past 2 hours of the movie were unceremoniously unveiled. The change is pace, while welcomed, is inconsistent with the slow pace of the rest of the movie.

Downton Abbey is a ""do over"" of Gosford Park that is written for less-specifically British audiences. This time, the aristocratic class is benignly exploiting the serving class and evolving into extnction. In the later episodes, everyone is a good guy and even the elaborate manners are dialed back.",1455580800,,1823,4.762658227848101

In this case some of the same cast is involved, topped by Maggie Smith. The story is deliciously upstairs, downstairs with the added fillip of a murder the befits a movie more than a series. Altman's trademark directorial detail adds flavor to anyone with an appreciation for the art of filmmaking. The caracricature character of a visiting Hollywood producer in the English manor household gives Altman the chance to poke holes in the Hollywood establishgment.

Now, years after Downton Abbey, we again watched Gosford Park, and realized it was indeed a fore-runner of the famed favorite. An ""upstairs/downstairs"" story. I have used closed captioning when I've watched Gosford Park recently. The story is fairly complicated, and following it well requires being able to hear the dialogue, which is sometimes not easy to hear. I recommend the movie as being fine entertainment if you like the genre of lords and ladies, living their lives of privilege, often at the expense of their faithful staff.

I personally like Gosford Park better than Downton Abbey because it is a whodunnit while playing off Upstairs Downstairs but from the servants point of view. And being a movie, you can watch from start to absolute finish in one sitting.  Helen Miren is in it as well as several other British stars who keep popping up in other British series. Maggie Smith's role was a dress rehearsal for the Dowager.  It's an Agatha Christie on a higher scale.  I wish he'd write more like this!",1453334400,,599,4.5092592592592595

1673732,5,B00005V7CT,"""Gosford Park"" is pretty much perfect. The first time I saw it, I was puzzled by the inclusion of Ryan Phillippe (I'm not generally a fan of his acting.) and thought it was a mistake on the scale of casting Keanu Reeves in an otherwise perfect adaptation of ""Much Ado About Nothing."" And yet, as the movie went on, even that casting seemed inspired.

I rewatched this when I was frustrated with the soapiness (and my general lack of interest in) Downton Abbey, as I learned that both Gosford and Downton were written by Julian Fellowes. I hadn't realized that both are made up of more or less the same characters (even Maggie Smith as Lady Trentham/Lady Grantham), and yet the direction and storyline of Gosford just make it so superior to Downton in my view.",1453161600,,759,4.580882352941177

1673787,5,B00005V7CT,"Warning:  put on the subtitles with this.  In each scene, nobody talks terribly clearly and there are often several conversations going on at once.  The Director (Robert Altman, I think) did it this way because he said, in real life, normal people don't ""project"" their voices as if they are on the stage, nor do they have microphones.  Instead, they mumble, talk away from you, and in a room, everybody talks at once.  He failed to realize however that in real life, you're not trying to understand every conversation from everyone in the room all at once, just the one person you're standing next to, and the person ""mumbling"" is mumbling to you directly in your face so you don't have to constantly guess what they're saying.  It's a dumb, boring movie if you don't have the subtitles on.  If you do have them on, it's interesting with many characters to study, lots of plots and subplots going on.

1673796,4,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is a mystery comedy-drama film that stars an ensemble cast, which includes Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, and Michael Gambon. Aside from that,it also features Charles Dance, Tom Hollander, Natasha Wightman, and Ron Webster. The story follows a party of wealthy Britons and an American and their servants, who gather for a shooting weekend at the English country house, Gosford Park. A murder occurs after a dinner party and the film goes on to present the subsequent investigation into it from both the servants' and the guests' perspectives. It was written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Robert Altman.

Sir William McCordle and his wife Lady Sylvia are a pair of wealthy British socialites who have invited a variety of friends, relatives, and acquaintances to their mansion in the country for a weekend of hunting and relaxation. Among the honored guests are Constance, Lady Sylvia's matronly aunt; Ivor Novello, William's cousin who is also a well-known actor and songwriter; and Morris Weissman, an American film producer who is friendly with Ivor and researching an upcoming project. Observing the proceedings are the domestic staff of the mansion, including imperious butler Jennings; footmen George and Arthur; Probert, a valet to Sir William; housekeeper Mrs. Wilson; Mrs. Croft, who oversees the kitchen; and Elsie, a maid. Also on hand are the guests' personal servants, including Mary, Constance's maid; Henry, Weissman's valet; and Parks, a butler. While the servants are required to display a high level of decorum, they are expected to be passive observers who do not comment on what they see, though the gossip among them travels thick and fast once they retire to the servants' quarters downstairs. And it turns out that there's plenty worth gossiping about, especially after Sir William turns up dead, and everyone is ordered to stay at the mansion while the police investigate the killing.

This is a scintillating comedy-drama and one of Altman's most richly moving and entertaining pictures as contents and style converge smoothly and seductively in this luxuriant period drama that applies Agatha Christie murder-mystery format to a rigorous anatomy of British class structure in the 1930s, with all the who's who in U.K. in the cast. Also,it juggles about thirty different characters, moving them from the upper-class upstairs to the servants' quarters and the movie does so without losing the audience. It is is slow, but it does eventually lead of to a murder,which happens to be the main focus of the film, but at the same time it emphasizes the entangled relationships of everyone in the house. I think that's the reason this film succeeds despite of its negative flaws which makes it at least a good film but not a great one.",1433548800,,2794,5.125
1673797,5,B00005V7CT,Most excellent movie. Rewards multiple viewings,1433289600,,47,7.0
1673798,5,B00005V7CT,"If you're appetite is for a typical Agatha Christie murder mystery, it may be best to look elsewhere. As another reviewer pointed out, the whodunit aspect takes a back seat to the spontaneous interactions of the characters, which are split between the filthy rich and the hired help. The story is completely non-linear. The script is literally wall-to-wall character studies, with the players moving from scene-to-scene like real people moving from room-to-room. What they do and how they got to this place is revealed only incidentally, leaving the audience to speculate as to the characters' back stories. And there is plenty of overlapping dialog to add to the ambiguity. It feels more like the viewer is spying on these people rather than watching a typical movie presentation.

In true Altman style, two dozen characters are thrust together by way of a holiday weekend at a large English manor. The aristocrats are very busy, dressing, gossiping and shooting harmless birds by day, eating luxurious meals, playing games, and enjoying entertainment from a Hollywood movie star by night. They probably need some relaxation from all that work. All the while the servants are preparing food, washing clothes needlessly at night, and polishing their employers' watches with barely a moment to enjoy a meal or other extra-curricular activity themselves. But the servants and aristocracy share something in common: they all have their own little stories which are revealed in bits and pieces through unselfconscious dialog.

Both sides enjoy equal screen time. However, as the events progress, the viewer realizes that the hired help is not viewed in quite the same way as their aristocratic counterparts. Even from the beginning, when two of the upper-class characters are squabbling about their ""problems"", one of the servants overhears their discourse. When one of the aristocrats realizes that eavesdropping is occurring, the reaction is rather unexpected, ""Don't worry, it's nobody."" The servants don't really count as people, probably the prevailing view in 1930's England which had much of the same view of commoners as it had in the 16th and 17th centuries. And yet this attitude toward servants as ""lesser"" people has a profound impact on the quite unexpected ending of the film.

One of the worst of the snobbish aristocrats is Countess Constance, played with perfect over-bearing stiltedness by the incomparable Maggie Smith. And of course she has one of the best lines: ""I haven't a snobbish bone in my body."" But of course she has her employee on bended knee throughout the film. You wonder if she may be a just target of the murderer's weapon! Later in the film, one of the servant characters moves up a few rungs on the hierarchical ladder literally overnight, much to the jealousy of the rest of the hired help.

Part of what transpires seems very unscripted. Even by half-way through the film, the viewer only has a vague sense of who these people are. It is akin to certain science fiction films where aspects of futuristic life are presented without explanation. In Gosford Park, the stories of the characters are never announced but only hinted. Even by the moment of the murder, which occurs about 2/3rds through the story, the viewer is only beginning to understand some things about the characters, but much is left unsaid and unrevealed.

One of the interesting features of the film is that the story is entirely cast-driven. The ensemble is made up of name talent, but no ""big"" Hollywood stars, which is quite a breath of fresh air from the typical star-driven offerings that Hollywood is constantly cranking out. Instead, the cast is comprised of recognizable character actors who are often in supporting roles in the larger-budgeted Hollywood films. These people are some of the best actors in the business. It's somehow fitting that they would come together for this project.

One other notable aspect is that some of the best actors play the servant parts, such as Helen Mirren (academy award-winner) who plays Mrs Wilson, the head woman servant, the late Alan Bates (renowned British actor) as Mr Jennings, the head of all servants, and Derek Jacobi of Caedfel fame as Mr Probert, another butler/servant of the Lord's manor.

An outstanding film, with an unexpected and sobering ending that forces you to think rather than feel fully satisfied in an escapist sort of way, like an Agatha Christie presentation might. This is a major achievement and a fitting swan song to one of the most innovative directors who worked in Hollywood, the late Robert Altman. Although this was not technically his last film, this was probably his last best achievement. Not to be missed if you're into cutting edge film-making particularly of the overlapping dialog variety. Altman wrote the textbooks on it, called MASH, The Player, and Gosford Park.",1432684800,,4860,5.075093867334168

The film is a bit over two hours long and it take over an hour for the murder (of Sir William) to occur. During that time the plot shows a number of individuals with some reason to strongly dislike Sir William. However, the number of characters (including their servants) becomes too much to absorb - thus, it is unclear who is whom through the film. Turns out that one of the head servants (Mrs. Wilson) poisoned Sir William because she knew her son (servant Parks) was going to kill him. (Parks didn't know Mrs. Wilson was his mother. The police are incompetent, no perpetrator is found, and those who know who did it are satisfied - hanging someone for the crime wouldn't accomplish anything.",1430784000,,869,4.64935064935065

The bonus was the wonderful Agatha Christie"" ""like""plot. Murder at a shooting party in an old english country estate where everyone is a suspect. Its a period piece that opens itself up for the subtle satire which meanders through the film. Each character plays their role to perfection. The only over the top character is played for laughs by the bumbling local constabulary. As his investigation proceeds he is able to eliminate all possible suspects. Hmmm.
Giving nothing away our murderer is revealed from obscure clues presented early in the film and the unknown connections to each other only given at the end as expected.

1673867,5,B00005V7CT,"Fantastic movie. I should start by saying that this was directed by Robert Altman, who is a quirky but brilliant--American, not British--director. Well, who cares if he was American? It's a great picture. It was a magnificent ensemble cast: Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi, Clive Owens, and Maggie Smith, just to name a few. If you only recognize King Arthur's Clive Owens on that list, you may not enjoy this movie--it is funny, but it's not a Seth Green comedy. It's more like an Agatha Christie novel set in the 1920s English countryside, mixed with Downton Abbey (in fact, Downton Abbey gets much of its energy from this movie--though this is much better) with a few laughs thrown in. But the best part of the movie is the emotional connection between the characters, as in most Altman movies.

1673878,2,B00005V7CT,"To this very day, I simply don't understand why Robert Altman gets all these accolades for being such a great director.  The whole point of a movie is to be either creative and artistic or to tell a good story.  Altman has tried to do both and comes up, once again, short.  Even Citizen Kane is a little overrated as the story wasn't great but the combination of story and artistic direction made it a classic because it was the first to do so at such a high level.

Altman ain't Wells.

Altman has never come close to an acceptable combination of art and story and this film is no exception.  At well over two hours, this is no more than a 90 minute movie.  The ""clever"" story line is inundated with subplots that lead to nothing and the obvious answer to the mystery is recognized the minute you find out the patriarch has had many children with many women.  By the end of the film, the clever ""double"" murdering was bland and with a total lack of suspense.  My only thought was, wow, something finally happened.

I fully understand what Altman was trying to do but he, again, failed miserably.  This movie was horribly directed.  If Hitchcock would have directed this movie, it could probably have been a classic.  Simply, the characters needed more development and we needed to feel the passion of why they disliked the patriarch so much.  Because of the poor development, I had as much sympathy for the characters as I have for wallpaper paste because we learned virtually nothing about the characters.

If you like Altman, then you'll probably enjoy this.  For me, I will never watch another boring Altman movie as long as I live.  If you like poor character development, lot's of extraneous dialogue and scenes, and a predictable ending with zero passion, you'll love this movie.  Pretensiousness at it's worst.",1417651200,,1818,4.64576802507837

1673915,5,B00005V7CT,"A masterpiece! Gosford Park is so entertaining, so fascinating, and so precise that I found myself in tears of dumbfounded disbelief - twice! A stunning piece of work, it is essentially a traditional manor house whodunnit but it is populated by the most unforgettable and dynamic characters ever aligned with the genre. A murder mystery to end all murder mysteries. A magnificent film that is unquestionably a classic and easily a personal all time favorite.

Gosford Park is one of the best written films ever made. Written with exceptional skill and exquisite flair by Julian Fellowes, Gosford Park is a work of pure genius. A flowing and supreme masterpiece, expertly directed by Robert Altman, it is a film that is smooth as silk and luscious as fine brandy. It is a monumental achievement. It will keep you guessing until the very end, for even if you think you might know WHO the murderer is, the true mystery is WHY it took place. Gosford Park is a film of many different characters, worlds, and sub-plots. The fact that Fellowes and Altman were able to organize all of the unique and individual players and events into one fluid yarn is extraordinary. With a film of this large an ensemble, it is foreseeably simple to muddle it up with convolution. Gosford Park maintains a disciplined coherence throughout and never ceases to amaze and enthrall its guest. Gosford Park is a very special film. It is a magnificent one that can make a grand toast to perfection.

Gosford Park comes readily, boasting the finest ensemble cast of the medium. Featuring such talented and revealing actors as Emily Watson, Kelly Macdonald, Richard E. Grant, Clive Owen, and Maggie Smith, the film is no stranger to pathos. Even Ryan Phillippe turns in an unexpected and noteworthy performance as the mysterious Mr. Denton. There is not one sour performer, they are all a delight to watch and extremely capable in their roles. For a film comprised of a cast that borders on immaculate, show-stealers must have been something akin to genius. There are two of these so-called 'show-stealers', both of whom lay down two of my favorite performances ever put on film. Gosford Park is not only a film of beautiful craftsmanship, it is also the beneficiary of two of the most lovely performances I have ever seen.

That of Kristin Scott Thomas and Helen Mirren. Two fine actors giving exemplary performances that are sure to gain an infinite appreciation as time goes on. We shall start with Miss Thomas. As Sylvia McCordle, not one frame is wasted on her. She delivers not one untrue line of dialogue and maintains a disciplined naturality throughout. She is startlingly consummate, gorgeous, and skilled. It is with her body language and behavior that she astonishes me most. It's as if she really were that woman, the snobbish and selfish debutante of remote compassion. Extremely controlled and unsympathetic, Miss Thomas stole every scene she was in because of her instinctive understanding of conduct and how comfortable she appeared in her role. She was absolutely incredible to watch, an elegantly honed performance of nuance and sensibility. Uncannily natural and fascinating. A performance that has long gone unnoticed and has since been virtually forgotten, in Gosford Park, Kristin Scott Thomas proved herself capable of legend. An unbelievably well crafted performance and one of the absolute best supporting portrayals ever committed to film.

Now for Miss Mirren. A walking bereavement of soul. As Mrs. Wilson, the depressing embodiment of absolute servitude, she expresses the deepest pathos I have ever felt. Her performance in the film is of such a melancholy quality that I never expected to be so moved by a character before in my life. Of woes and sorrow, Mirren communicated entire empty and ruined worlds with her unfulfilled eyes and her carefully restrained physicality and emotion. A fiercely guarded but very revealing depiction of a sad and tragic reality. With hardly a life to call her own, she is a victim of the British caste system and of a penetrative self shame. A very sad character played perfectly by a very responsive actress. Helen Mirren is otherworldly, phenomenally well suited for it and startlingly poignant. She is faultless, a performance without a single flaw. Mirren, like Thomas, is now a legend in my book. Their work in Gosford Park is of the most supreme quality. Their work in Gosford Park is legend. It is forever. Two perfect examples of why I love film.

The ensemble is split up into two distinct social classes. The upstairs and the downstairs. The masters and the servants. This is a very intriguing theme, as we are privy to two entirely separate but parallel  worlds. The servants paying tribute to the same rituals as their masters. Gossiping and romancing, scheming and dealing. This focus of social class brings many unanswerable questions to the forefront. Not questions like, ""Why are certain people born lucky and others aren't?"", but more intangible ones like, ""What is happiness?"" and ""What is love?"", ""What is family?"", ""What is a full life?"". Gosford Park meditates on these questions patiently and understandably. Apart from the theme of sociology, the film also touches upon homosexuality and antisemitism in a very commendable way that intrigues more than intensifies any ongoing interpersonal relationship. The thematic elements of Gosford Park are presented just as elegantly as anything else in the the film. These themes are just as gorgeous and satisfying as everything else that makes up this perfect film.

Gosford Park is an extraordinary production, beaming with ingenuity and splendor. An absolutely perfect film that only gets better upon multiple viewings and prolonged stays. Everyone involved gets their moment to shine, from the cast to the crew, they all have their moment of poignancy. Gosford Park is, without a doubt in my mind, the very best film of its generation and decade. The best of an era. A personal favorite and a damn great piece of work.",1407801600,3,6022,5.022022022022022

1673943,4,B00005V7CT,"Advertisers made this movie out to be some kind of high-class ""Clue"" style mystery, when actually it's equal parts history, sociology, and drama. It's like an Agatha Christie whodunnit in that all kinds of unfortunate scandals are uncovered once the murder itself is actually committed. That murder, however, does not occur until past the halfway mark of the movie.

The focus of the movie is really the minutiae of the characters' dialogue and the period detail--every single remark, nuance, and scrap of paper hanging on the walls reveals depths about the characters, their social class, the time and the period.

I think the movie works better on a second viewing while listening to Julian Fellowes' running commentary. You can better appreciate the level of detail and insight into English society between the wars--where it came from, where it went, and why. The reason I give the movie less than 5 stars is that, despite much exceedingly fine acting and an Oscar-winning screenplay, the appeal of this movie is beneath its surface. Only Anglophiles and Downton Abbey enthusiasts will completely warm up to it.",1400976000,,1115,5.087431693989071

But, despite this I am able to fully appreciate the great performance by Maggie Smith and the rest of the cast.  The story is so well done I wonder if this weekend is a recreation of real life events.

This whodunit will keep you guessing.  You are unknowingly given clues throughout the film.  All does come clear.  I won't give it away.

What I like the best is you are given a look into the life of those of privilege and those who serve them.

It is basically about rich people and they all get together and come to this mansion. It consists of family and a few Americans. Things are drama filled with issues within the family.

1673981,1,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park, 2001 film

A car arrives at a mansion on a rainy day. A lady enters and is driven away. Is everything OK? [An American expression.] It is November 1932. [Note the dirt road.] Servants help the arriving guests. A big house needs a lot of servants. One man carries a small dog. One guest makes films in Hollywood. [Does the servants language reflect their status?] One film was a flop. One guest has a special diet. The servants are known by their masters name [to simplify things]. The small talk by the servants tell about their interests. Ivor Novello servant used to be an actor. [Is that remark about Charlie Chan movies historical for 1932?] We also hear the comments of the masters. One couple has an argument. The table seating of servants is by the rank of their masters.

The table talk tells of the masters interests. A lady talks to a manservant; she is bored. One maid washes a shirt late at night. A valet visits a lonely lady. The morning sees the men gathering for a shooting party. One woman worries about her husbands lack of a job. Servants beat the woods to drive the game birds into the air so they can be shot down for sport. Dogs retrieve the fallen birds. Lunch is served outdoors. One man seems desperate for funding. Will a daughters allowance be stopped? Cards after dinner? The producer talks about his movie Charlie Chan in London. It takes place at a country mansion. A maid speaks out her place! What will happen to Elsie now? Ivor sings while he plays the piano. [Dont they have a radio or Victrola?]

An unknown man carries a knife and uses it! Who was absent from the party? Shouldnt the host be with his guests? A scream halts the party! The guests enter the room. A woman faints. The police are called. An Inspector and Constable arrive. No one will leave now. Is there much blood from the wound? What does that mean? Does her Ladyship need company? In the morning the Inspector talks to the servants. The guests have breakfast. The servants talk about the murder. The cook tells about her job in a factory. Who benefitted from the murder? The other servants learn about the background of another. Why do some people have a talent for getting rich?

The guests gather in a room, they cant leave until the Inspector releases them. The story continues to amble on. We learn a new fact about the parentage of a man. [Is this scene believable?] Jennings needs a rest. One servant speaks ill of the dead. One servant has a police record. The guests drive away. One woman asks why did you do it? She replies. Does the gift of anticipation make a good servant? She will keep her secret. A departing guest tips a servant. Two sisters talk. Being alive is what matters. And so this movie finally ends.

A long list of credits follow. The location was Syon House, owned by the Duke of Northumberland. The story and characters are fictitious, the real person named in this story was never in Gosford Park. Offhand, I cant remember a worse murder mystery. Dont say I didn't warn you. This story came from an idea by Robert Altman and Bob Balaban. I hope they come up with a better idea for a movie in the future.

1673988,4,B00005V7CT,"I attempted to watch Gosford Park years ago and I was bored and never finished it but rewatching it now, I found it quite enjoyable. Its booked as a murder mystery, but its really an education on the upstairs/downstairs world of the aristocracy and their servants. This movie has a huge, all-star cast and its a loving homage to a lost time and place: the pre-war country estate of formal dinner, fox hunts, and drawing rooms. The story surrounds the McCordle family. The patriarch is rich, titled, and surrounded by relatives for a shooting party. He pulls at everyones strings because they're dependent upon his largesse in some form or another. The attendants are at his estate for a weekend of shooting and every one is on edge because they all want something from him. The more interesting part of the story is in the lives of the servants. They are equally as invested in the lives of their masters and can move freely around the house because the guests speak freely in front of them, almost as if they don't exist. While the movie is ostensibly about the murder of the patriarch, said murder doesnt occur until well past the first half of the movie. A detective comes, everyone is asked to stay, and everyone wonders who may have done it. The guests assume it is likely a thief, the detective assumes it must be a guest (since no servant has enough invested to commit such a crime) but one maid discovers the truth. The lead housekeeper did it in order to prevent her son, one of the guests valets from committing the crime, and he did it because he is the illegitimate son of the victim. While the revelation was interesting, the movie kept my interest because of the variety of subplots: the unfaithful wife, the hollywood director who wants a peek into the aristocracy, and the whole host of hungry relatives nipping at the hand of their benefactor. While the movie reveals itself slowly, the cadence is pleasing and rich in detail.",1392595200,,1943,4.6347826086956525

1674041,5,B00005V7CT,"Possibly his best film all told, but it does have to contend with 5 or 6 others. I don't understand the low rating on Amazon at all. This film was outright robbed at the Oscars by the very average A Beautiful Mind. It really was not even close. Hollywood never liked Altman, but what he gave to cinema more than made up for that loss in popularity. Many of his films are instant classics. This is one of them. The cast is mesmerizing, the plot intriguing at every turn, and the directing nothing short of the best of the year. It still won a lot of awards and it deserved the Oscar no question about it.

The weaving of storylines between a wild game of clue is too hard to resist. People have to give this film a shot at least. If it's too long for you well then I think you need to check your head. This is art here. True art. A filmmaker at the height of his powers. Watching the entire thing unfold is a joy.

Why Altman does not get the respect he deserves on Bluray is maddening. Criterion is releasing a few now and then and they are glorious, but many of his films remain unavailable, as Altman was never too friendly with the studios and their greed. Step by step I think we will see better releases of all his films though it will take some time. This transfer is mediocre, done on a 25GB Bluray with a weak bitrate. I wouldn't honestly buy it.

Let's get it out of the way. The film itself is amazing! The problem is the product. While the DVD jampacks itself with excellent extras the Blu-ray version took everything out--including the subtitles. Yes. I'm serious. With the only option on the ""main menu"" is to switch audio from DTS to Dolby 5.1, this version of an amazing film is just disappointing. The transfer isn't clean as well. Everything seems to be done with a grotesque laziness that it completely mirrors the masterfully orchestrated whodunit Oscar winner. Sadly, you're better off with the DVD copy.

I must confess that it is a complicated story and accents are sometimes difficult to follow easily for this Texan, but I've watched it several times, as well as researching the actors with whom I'm less familiar, to know who is who.  The  story is intriguing, the settings elegant and I like that it's set in the 30s, the decade of my birth.  Since Downton is in the teens and  20s, it's a good follow-up, showing the advance of fashions, life-styles and rights for women.  The music is wonderful and exciting that it's based on several of the actual compositions by one of the characters in it, an actual movie star of the 30s, Ivor Novello.  A contrast of the Hollywood characters in the story to the main-character upper-class Britishers is interesting.  It's a good story!",1376092800,2,932,4.709876543209877

Maggie Smith is wonderful and, yes, her performance in this Julian Fellowes script prefigures the type of character she plays in Downton Abbey. In that regard it is similar with upstairs-downstairs intrigues. But we could have used a little help identifying characters at the beginning. Once we figured out who was who with the help of a Wikepedia entry on the movie, we enjoyed it thoroughly. Robert Altman's directing is flawless, there isn't a weak performance in the film. Who knew Jeremy Northampton could SING? All is fine until the ending which disappoints.

November 1932, Sir William McCordle played by Michael Gambon and Lady Sylvia McCordle, played by Kristin Scott Thomas have invited guests for a shooting party. Sir William's sister Constance, the Countess of Trentham played magnificently by Maggie Smith, who depends on an allowance he is constantly threatening to withdraw. Lady Sylvia's sister Louisa, played by Louisa Somerville, who married for money. Louisa's husband, Commander Anthony Meredith , played by Tom Hollander. Lavinia, played by Natasha Wightman, married to Raymond, Lord Stockbridge, played by Charles Dance. Hollywood star Ivor Novello, played by Jeremy Northam. Morris Weissman, played by Bob Balaban, a gay Hollywood producer who has brought along his ""valet"" Henry Denton played by Ryan Phillippe.

Downstairs, we meet the butler Jennings played by Alan Bates, the housekeeper Mrs. Wilson, played by Helen Mirren, the cook Mrs. Croft , played by Eileen and other valets, maids, grooms and servers. As we know from Downton Abbey, the downstairs is the most fun with the most interesting gossip!

Someone is murdered, an investigation ensues, and the most inept Inspector, played by Stephen Fry enters the picture. We learn a great deal about the murdered person, not from the inspector, but from the gossip and the words not spoken. Kelly MacDonald, of 'Boardwalk ' fame plays a maid to Countess of Tretham. She is the most active in her sly ways of discovering a truth. Is it the real truth?

This is one of the first films looking at the life of the Upstairs, Downstairs group. It is colorful, filled with humor and snide remarks. The sad life of the downstairs folks is fully displayed.

1674121,1,B00005V7CT,"Charming it wasn't. I agree with another reviewer - it was rather crude and tasteless, completely different from Downton Abbey. It is not the content but the treatment of the content that was different. People compare the films, but to me the only thing they have in common is that they deal with upper class Britons and their servants in an English manor house. Most of Gosford Park's characters are unsavory; there was no one you could really care about with the possible exception of Mary, Elsie, and maybe Parks, until you actually got to know them. The story itself was predictable (my husband and I knew one of the servant women from Sir William's past was going to kill him long before the murder occurred) and the dialogue, for the most part, was not particularly witty or interesting. In fact, any one of the guests or hosts could have been murdered and we couldn't have cared less. It wasn't humorous, it wasn't exciting, the investigator was without charm and the investigation (as much as we saw of it) was mishandled and thus dull for a murder mystery. As a comedy of manners, it fell far below Downton Abbey or any well-written English novel.

1674130,3,B00005V7CT,"As a Brit film admirer and a Downton Abbey devotee, I recently found myself wondering how I had missed this one.  I had a dim memory of starting to watch it once when it was on TV but not making it very far.  After sitting through the whole thing, I am convinced that memory was accurate.

Any film with a lot of characters is a challenge.  In this film some of the characters resemble each other, a lot of them dress similarly, and many of them have very few lines.  Also the dialogue is heavily accented and hard to understand.  I really hate to sound like the Ugly American, but I did not find this movie to be very accessible.  It was wonderful to see some of my favorite actors onscreen.  However, my brain was scrambling to translate dialogue and keep up with plot developments from start to finish.

Now that I have made it through and am metaphorically out of breath, I feel I need to watch it again, to see some other favorites whom I didn't even recognize (Meg Wynn-Owen, Laurence Fox), but it's a daunting prospect. Maybe I'll see if there are English subtitles on the DVD, that might help.

This film definitely has a lot to say on the subject of class in 1930s Britain.  I don't personally think it is a brilliant movie or even especially entertaining.  I would single out the performances of Maggie Smith, Kelly Macdonald, and Stephen Fry, but I am sure this was intended to be an ensemble effort with no standouts.  I have tremendous respect for all the fans of this film, suspecting they have done some work to ""get"" it.  I prefer films that are not such hard work.",1361145600,2,1581,4.406896551724138

Besides giving viewers an intriguing window into the class-conscious society of the early 1900s and the frivolities and abuses that were sometimes a part of that system, the variety of characters and inter-relationships mirrors life in any time period. The plot gradually builds to the shocking murder and then coasts to the poignant finish, which never fails to bring me to tears every time I watch this.

The characters come in the beginning in such profusion they are difficult to later identify and many of them tend to look much alike.  I read the Wikipedia summary but even that didn't much help. One that does stick in mind is the pretty boy butler played by Ryan Phillippe, but only because he has a fake Scots accent and as usual isn't very good. Another problem is that most talk ""sotto voce"" so that it is almost impossible to understand what they are saying. If there were subtitles that defect could be overcome but there are only Spanish, not English, subtitles.

1674166,3,B00005V7CT,"A wealthy English industrialist invites a score of friends and relatives to a shoot at his country estate, during the course of which he manages to threaten and infuriate a number of them, by withdrawing support for their business plans, canceling the allowances of relatives and abusing nearly everyone, That night, he's murdered, and the following day a quirky detective shows up in order to sort things out, gather everyone into the same room, and identify the guilty party. The traditional English drawing-room murder mystery.

Except when it's done by Robert Altman. Altman brings all his skills and quirks to what would otherwise be yet another overly affected episode of Masterpiece Theater, making it into something very different. You've got the gorgeous Altman photography, for one thing, with long, involved scene that move through house, turn corners, and have dozens of characters entering and exiting. The effect is one of being inside of a stage play, and when it works, it works very well. But you also have Altman's more annoying filmic tics to deal with. The mood of the movie moves from solemn to slapstick and back again, and you're never quite sure what you should be feeling. Everyone is quite tense following the murder, and who should show up to investigate, but a comically bumbling detective inspector played by Stephen Fry, accompanied by a suffering- but deadly serious- sergeant. In the end, we, the viewers, know who did it, and why, courtesy of a confession freely given to a total stranger, but the guests and the police never do find out what happened, at least by the end of the movie, so far as are allowed to see.

What saves this film and makes it worth watching is the collection of outstanding performances by leading English actors in a wide range of roles. There's Maggie Smith as the vituperative old aunt, a role she really owns in modern cinema. Michael Gambon doing the old industrialist. Helen Mirren as Head of House. Alan Bates as Jennings, the tortured, alcoholic butler with a secret that eats at him. Jeremy Northam doing a fabulous job singing his way through his role as Ivor Novello. Frank Thornton, late of ""Are You Being Served?"" as Mr. Burkett. The list goes on and on, with one superb performance after another, the sole exception being Bob Balalban delivering yet another wooden, stereotypical performance.

So why three stars? Well, as entertaining as it is at times, it just doesn't really hang together. At the end the viewer has the feeling that they've been flipping back and forth between two different versions of the same movie, one a drama and the other a farce. Fun, yes, but also somewhat unsatisfying.",1351987200,,2672,4.894039735099338

My problem with the movie is that there was so much interaction occurring at the same time.  It was interwoven and hard to pay attention to everything at once.  Especially with the English & Scottish accents.  I had to take a star off the rating for this movie simply for the lack of English subtitles.  I cannot understand why they were not included with a movie this heavily accented.  (To my way of speaking.)  I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I could have understood it as it went along.  The accents were very pretty but they left too much puzzlement in their wake.

1674178,1,B00005V7CT,"First; let me say that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this film. Beginning with seeing it multiple times in the cinema upon it's initial release, to buying, listening to and appreciating the wonderful soundtrack CD to the film and opening up the world of Ivor Novello and his music to the unacquainted; to buying the DVD releases..needless to say I am a big fan.
That is why I am truly so saddened by this VERY anemic blu-ray release.
What do you have to look forward to on upgrading to blu-ray if you already own the standard DV releases? In my opinion..nothing.  Zero.  NOT even an improved picture quality I would say IN FACT, I would say the blu-ray release's print
in of less quality that DVD's.
Second: on the Blu-ray, you get NO SUBTITLE availability. NOTHING. And you DID get subtitles on the prior released DVDs.
Third: Audio- I am not sound engineering pro, barely fluent in some of the terminology, but then again, like many average viewers who aren't either, I would say that the playback levels on the blu-ray seemed lower. To be fair, there ARE options for choosing your audio presentation (the ONLY option on the entire Blu-ray by the way). Lastly, because this movie is a period piece (1930's) and because of the very tone, era, subject matter and so on, this film is just about entirely bereft of any types of special effects, the presence of which..in a ""larger that life"" cinema world of today which demands explosions, machine sounds, and so on, the audio level here is pretty much that for the entire film..level.
Fourth and Fifth: Commentaries and Special Features (documentaries/interviews/etc)..simply..the standard DVD has 2 commentary tracks and a few Gosford Park special presentations..the blu-ray has NONE

Every movie and every TV show in Blu-Ray that I have shown on the 80 inch screen have looked extremely sharp and clear.  Not this disc. It looked soft and almost out of focus. The company that did the transfer obviously felt nobody who bought this disc would have a large screen TV.  This Blu-Ray dics actually looked worse than some standard DVDs upscaled to 1080p.  Also there were NO SUBTITLES. Every DVD of movies and TV shows that I have ever bought has subtitles. It is a standard feature. Buying a DVD without subtitles is like buying an automobile without seats. Also none of the extra features that were on the regular DVD were on this Blu-Ray copy.

1674181,4,B00005V7CT,"Delightfully odd is what I call Gosford Park.  Without getting as picky as many other reviews floating around, I'd say this cross of an Agatha Christie Ms. Marple mixed with Howard's End.  Even then, I'm making it seem quite dark - which it isn't.  This is the most entertaining ensemble piece I've seen in a very long time and Altman has an effortless touch with so many legendary actors crammed into an old house around a dead body.

In a sense, there's almost too much going on for the film's own good.  In the last third, some characters drift in and out of the narrative simply because the plot gets in the way which is a disappointment compared to the first chunk of the film.  Before the body turns up, it's less a forced setup for suspects than a supreme exercise in just hanging out.  Howard Hawks made a western in the same style with John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson called Rio Bravo.  There too do we get caught up in the daily musings and sing song of some old friends locked in a jail house.  There too does the film lose steam when the story gets in the way.  But here, one must congratulate Altman for corralling so much talent and funneling it into something genuinely entertaining and, at times, even absorbing.

Gosford Park is a victim of its quality.  There's so much to see and so much to tell, when he gets around to making a movie out of it, it's just not as interesting as what came before.  Even so, there's few other movies I've seen in the last 20 years that offer so much for your time.",1333238400,,1539,4.3578947368421055

1674186,3,B00005V7CT,"This is an average film that should have been a good film.  It is unsatisfying.

Upon reflection, notwithstanding the Academy Award to Julian Fellows, the problem lies with the script.  It has the wrong feel.  Robert Altman did not understand the culture being depicted, and so it is depicted through a lens that doesn't capture it accurately.  There is dialogue in the script that is just wrong.  There are accents that are wrong.  There is body language that is wrong, that does not fit properly in the class structure of that society.  It isn't badly wrong, but it is consistently wrong throughout the film. It persistently undermines the credibility of the charcters.

Notwithstanding reasonable acting, the scripted portrayal of the police inspector and his sidekick is particularly weak. It is utterly ham-fisted - something that fits in an Americn film, perhaps, but not on an English country estate in the early 1930's.  If the Director has decided to make a murder mystery drama, then he needs to make up his mind to do a murder mystery drama.  It cannot include inspector Clouseau and remain a serious film. The weakness of that portrayal undermines both the seriousness of the drama, and the critique of the English class structure.  That is not the only portrayal that is ham-fisted, either.

Upper class English society was then (and sometimes even now, is) about reserve, suppression of emotion, subtlety, and irony.  If you were ""in service"" you were ""in service"".  Which member of the household staff in this film behaves as if they were ""in service"" or as if they understand what the term means?  Compare the conduct of the staff in this film with, for example, ""The Remains of the Day"", which captures it far, far better.

There is far too much swearing, at the wrong times, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong way, and frequently by the wrong people.

We have a Jewish American film producer at an estate in the English countryside, and the problem is that he is peculiar because he is a vegetarian? In that era?  In a society then riven with anti-semitism? Who is kidding whom?

His lordship is an industrial sweatshop owner?  Really?  In that era the landed class had a very strong aversion to people who were ""in trade"".  This fellow had multiple illegitimate children with working girls in his sweatshops? Are you doing Dickens, or are you doing Jane Austen?  Make up your mind.

Meanwhile his wife cavorts with the staff of strangers at the drop of a hot glass of milk? The scullery maid services every man in the place down in the kitchens, and hasn't been fired long since? Again, who is kidding whom?

It's too much.  Way, way, way too much. That concatenation of improbabilities adds up to several shark-jumpings.

At the end of the day, it is rooted in a basic problem: The director does not understand the society he is trying to depict on screen, and doesn't get that his portrayal tends to caricature.  It spoils what could have been a much better film.",1330819200,14,2985,4.752918287937743

The scenes seem very rushed - almost like a cram for an exam - the dark lighting (I expect trying to be realistic for the period) was overdone. Plot was not bad but overall weak in many places.

The film does capture the eccentricities of the English - note the beautifully laid out refreshments after the shoot but with muddy, slippery floor underfoot - and also does capture the culture of that time - snobbish uppercrust gents not averse to cavorting with the female servants.

The best scene for me was the overlay of piano playing and songs while the crime was being committed with the servants really enjoying it as it drifted out to the corridor. The telephone conversation of the filmmaker from California at that time was also a bit overdone to be believable.",1327881600,3,982,4.897590361445783
1674193,4,B00005V7CT,"This movie was funny in places. Historical in places. Very British in all over. It kept moving so you didn't get bored but also entertained you. It is worth seeing. I was shocked to see Ryan Phillipe in it. Clive Owen always seems to over power his characters with his deep voice and very confident demeanor but he was so thin back then.

The drawbacks for me were

1) I cannot understand what some of those people were saying with their thick accents (even after seeing it 2 times), especially the daughter that was sleeping with that one woman's blond husband.

2) I think it is weaselly of Hollywood (even if it may be due to free trade pacts) to ""throw an American"" in a British setting just because it is an American film. Americans don't have to be everywhere.

3) It had too many minor characters getting in the way to where I was asking ""Who is that?"". I don't mean the extras . . . obviously there was a need for them . . . it was a mansion with lots of ""help"" running around. I mean the blond guy and black headed guy who came late. Who were they? And the one maid who swore her allegiance to the drunken head butler. Who was she? What was all of that about? And for that matter what was the drunken head butler's problem? And which was the head butler? The drunk at the end or the older blond headed guy sobbing over the dead body? It was a little confusing. But not enough to be a distraction. Maybe some of those other characters mentioned who they were and I just couldn't understand them.

4) It seems that all movies like this (British, set in a previous error, of high society, very Hollywood centric, etc) (e.g. A Room with a View, Another Country, Atonement, Damaged, etc) seem to insist on showing British folks fornicating in stairways, libraries, cellars, basements, bushes, weeds, fields, etc. Perhaps the point is that they are not as sophisticated and refined as they pretend.  But does it have to be a part of every one of these movies? Showing the kitchen maid and that black headed dude doing it in the kitchen and then in some random servant's room etc didn't add anything here.

5) And the staid examples of the snobby rich being mean to the lowly poor. We get it. The British have a class system. We know already.

How did Altman, Balaban and Fellowes get it so ""right?""  Painstaking research and incredible attention to detail. I love the way the water dribbles out of the tap in the basement. Even when trying, anachronisms are hard to find.

One suggestion if you're going to watch this for the first time (lucky you!): If you are a speaker of American English, or if you have any hearing impairment, use headphones. Altman's verite style has many conversations going on at the same time, many of which are being murmured in  well-bred, low-pitched voices.

A calm and mellow paced movie, it plays out with a lot of soft spoken talking and small chit-chat that at first you don't necessarily realize is crucial to the movie plot. While watching a scene, you will find that there is often much going on silently in the background. This is where watching the movie over and over comes into play. Once you know the ending and all of the crucial elements to the story, you can enjoy watching it again and catching all kinds of things going on in the background that you don't notice the first time around.

Many different smaller stories unfold for each of the characters throughout the movie. The more times you watch it, you will even discover small stories within larger stories. These smaller plots then all tie into the main murder mystery story. The scenes are almost always filled with many people all together in a room at the same time, so there is always a lot going on to pay attention to.

There's a small amount of cursing, no nudity and a few scenes of implied intimacy. There is nothing crude or tasteless that has been added.

It is common, nasty, ruthless and dare I say probably closer to the truth than ""Upstairs, Downstairs""... or that the times became after the era of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". The story became hard to follow, not because of the story itself... but rather the bad muffled quality of the sound during the gathering of more than one or two cast members at a time. In halls and in rooms where there is a lot of people and things going on such as a party, the dialog is frightfully muffled which makes some important facts hard to come buy.

The story itself is almost Christie in nature. This is due to the fact that there is a twist in the end that one could never predict. I will say nothing more than that because I do not want to spoil anything.

The Blu-Ray edition of the film has absolutely no special features and there is literally no menu for the disc, except one for selecting the language track.

1674214,5,B00005V7CT,"Either you embrace this sort of film or abhor it.  I fall into the former category. ""Gosford Park"" is a slow-paced but wryly perceptive examination of British classes in the early 1930s. Think of it as ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" as viewed through a microscope. The huge cast is difficult to identify upon first encounter, just because of the sheer number of worthy characters who share screen time. So effective is the acting that each of the personae seems to have a back history. This may cause momentary confusion, as you wonder why he or she is behaving in such an inexplicable manner. But it also fleshes them out and makes them appear to be real human beings, rather than conduits of stereotypical posturing. The story line is convoluted in the extreme, perfect for such a ""murder mystery."" I put that in quotes because homicide is only an excuse for screenwriter Julian Fellowes, director Robert Altman, and a brilliant contingent of actors to provide some of the most captivating dialogue and characterization that you are likely to see in any film anywhere. (Personally, I fell in love with Kelly Macdonald.) By all means, invest your money in ""Gosford Park."" You will not be disappointed, unless of course mindless action is your thing.

1674218,5,B00005V7CT,"'Gosford Park' is an atmospheric period drama set in 1930's England. It looks at the relationships between upstairs and downstairs in a country manor, combined with a murder mystery story. The murder is the least important aspect of this film and it is excellent as a social piece looking at the hierarchy and social conventions of aristocracy at that time. There is an amazing cast who all perform superbly, Maggie Smith is especially good, but they all act with skill and draw you in to their various characters. The costumes and sets add to the overall feel of the film and it is directed perfectly. It is quite slow paced, which I liked, but those expecting a fast paced thriller will be disappointed, this is one that builds in layers.

1674231,5,B00005V7CT,"The more I chew on `Gosford Park', the more I'm convinced that it may very well be Altman's best film.  Sure, I haven't seen a lot of his films, and some of them I'm not really all too keen on (his style as a director and screenwriter is an acquired taste, and that said style doesn't work all the time), but this film is really, truly impressive all the way around.  The best thing about this film though, is that it ages very well.  The first time I saw this film I merely liked it, but as time goes by the memory of this film only gets better, and with recent viewings it has become apparent to me that this particular social commentary only gets better and better with time.

When `Gosford Park' is mentioned, usually the first conversation hinges on the cast, more specifically the large female cast.  I'm going to save them for last.

It is 1932 and we are at a large (very large) country house in England.  A group of sophisticated socialites have gathered together for a shooting party, and almost instantaneously the distinctions are made and the parties divide; the wealthy to their lackadaisical meanderings, the servants to their countless duties.  With a twist of `Clue' proportions thrown in, a man (a very prominent figure) shows up dead and just about everyone is suspect.

For anyone who has delved into Altman's work, the layered texture of this films script will not come as a shock to you.  From the very beginning of his career, Altman has built his films on a brisk yet complex interchange of dialog.  For me, this film may be the best fit for Altman's use of words, and his ability to capture so much from a mere glimpse of individual communications.  As the LARGE ensemble cast confine themselves in corners, whispering knowledge of one another and trying heartily to solve the mystery themselves, Altman paints a profound and engrossing study of humanity.  As some have mentioned, this film really sinks into the layers of human complexity, fleshing out the motives to our actions, to our words; the very inner workings that move us to action.  It pains me that some dismiss this film without ever really giving it a chance to sink into their minds.

I almost did.

I'm thrilled that Oscar handed out their screenplay award to this film, for it really is a very complex yet attainable work of art.  The way that Altman breathily moves from character to character, just as the camera swoons in and out of each room, is just breathtaking.  He truly creates real people, and he does so with a tightly woven yet briskly realized collection of conversations that relay the fragility of human frailty without ever losing the earnestness (and humor) needed to create something fresh and entertaining.

And now, we get to the ladies.

I'm going to start by listing them off.  Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Kristen Scott Thomas, Kelly Macdonald and Emily Watson.  Those are just your big names, or recognizable faces, but they really do make the biggest impact.  Mirren and Smith were both Oscar nominated, and they were both outstanding in their respective roles.  Mirren is, without doubt, the better of the two.  Her tortured yet commanding presence perfectly reflects not only her character's social standing (her servitude is very reminiscent of Hopkin's astonishing turn in `The Remains of the Day') but also her inner soul; her person removed from manipulated impressions.  I love what Smith does here (her sudden burst of laughter on the couch is especially pristine) but I never thought she particularly deserved an Oscar nomination for it.  In fact, the fragility of Macdonald's naivety or the inner rumblings of Watson's guilt were, in my opinion, much more deserving of mention.  That said, the only actress here that really can tango with Mirren is Kristen Scott Thomas, the jilted wife and fiery staccato of a woman.  I love the coldness she brings to her every movement, and that sensual awkwardness (there is a lanky stiffness to her movements that I adore, for they instantly create naturalness within her character).  She really understood how to make the most of her screen time.  Now, while she doesn't actually have the emotional punch of Mirren's character, I still feel that Thomas's performance has the slight edge.

I would watch her pace a room before I'd watch anyone else.

So, in the end I highly recommend this.  I know I toted this as Altman's finest (and I know that the devoted Altman fan may totally fight me on this) but coming from a man who is not an Altman supporter in the definitive sense, I'd say that that statement is pretty solid.  I still fall back and forth between this and `Short Cuts', which is sheer brilliance, but both films are SO different that it is really hard to compare and or judge.  Personally, at this very moment, if I had to chose between the two (as in which film I'd rather sit down and watch right now), I'd go with `Gosford Park'.",1263427200,3,4911,4.716295427901524
1674232,5,B00005V7CT,"If one has a choice and is able to play NTSC format, the 2002 Collector's Edition of ""Gosford Park"" is the one to buy. First, it has subtitles, so one misses not a word of Julian Fellowes' champagne-sparkling dialogue as the actors move in and out of earshot at this Agatha Christie-like weekend house party gone awry. The DVD is also in letterbox format and the transfer is sharp and colourful, so that one can appreciate the luscious costumes, the sumptuous settings, and every detail down to the proper silver fish-fork. Thanks to Robert Altman's subtle direction, the viewer is given the impression that he is a participant, or at least, an eavesdropper, along with the servants, who, like silent characters in a Greek tragedy, are so taken for granted that they might as well be invisible--at least when they are upstairs. It is not until they are downstairs, or up in their cramped sleeping quarters, that they assume their human personae, and we discover that they have as many secrets (and are as rigid in their social conventions) as their ""betters"" upstairs.

The characters in the film are well-developed, from the wealthy lord of the manor down to the lowly tweeny. With its ""A-list"" ensemble cast, ""Gosford Park"" also treats us to the best of British acting (actually, the best anywhere!): where else can we find, in one movie, the likes of Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren (in what is, surely, one of her most moving performances), Emily Watson, Eileen Atkins, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Northam, Kelley MacDonald, Alan Bates, etc., etc.? Laurence Fox even has a small part. And Stephen Fry milks his ""Inspector Plod"" role for every ounce of humor.

The performance of Claudie Blakley deserves especial notice. In ""Gosford Park"" she plays the gauche outsider who has infused money into her marriage and is consequently dispised by her well-born but empty-pocketed husband. She is the only one of the ""upstairs"" guests who emerges as possessing genuine feelings that are not constricted by the ""rules"" of society.  Like a chameleon, Ms. Blakley inhabits her roles so thoroughly and with such sensitivity that she blends into the background of whatever film in which she appears (whether playing a flighty starlet in ""Cat's Meow"" or a housemaid Martha in ""Cranford""). Even though her name might not be on the tips of our tongues (as Mirren's is), Claudie Blakley's portrayals contribute the excellence that we have come to expect from British drama.

Not to be missed is Julian Fellowes' commentary, which surpasses the usual ""making of"" commentary and could well be utilised in a university course on British social history. He not only comments on the film but he also elucidates the complex composition of the aristocratic household in Britain before World War II.

And while I realise that this film might not be everybody's cup of tea--lovers of action flicks will hate it, the very complexity of the film makes it a delight to watch again and again. With every viewing, one discovers some new delight!",1261180800,4,3053,4.966731898238748

Like many Altman films such as ""MASH"" and ""Nashville"", ""Gosford Park"" relies more on characterization than plot, although the stories are quite good. The major plot of the film centers on the class conflict between those that are rich and those that work for the rich; whenever you pit the rich against the poor high drama will occur.

The ensemble cast consists of many of the best British actors out there including Kristin Scott Thomas, Oscar winners Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren, and Emily Watson and a young American actor named Ryan Phillipe who proved he could hold his own against this high caliber group of actors.

However, NONE of those words apply. I was COMPLETELY ENGROSSED with this film and was very happy I bought it. The move is not about a murder, catching a killer, or any of the other aspects typical of a murder-mystery. Instead, its a fascinating look at the British social class in the early 30's. That may sound slightly boring, but it was far from it. Gosford is chalk full of humor, sexual tension, witty lines, and a twisting plot. Aside from that, the movie is BEAUTIFULLY shot. Watching it on my widescreen HD TV, I couldn't help but feel pulled into the gorgeous colors captured by the skillful and fluid movements of the camera. Overall, Gosford Park is an excellent film that I would recommend without hesitation.

Each of the wealthy guests is incredibly spoiled and oblivious to the world downstairs, where the servants have their own hierarchy and drama. Everyone has a secret and they all unfold much to our delight.

Director Robert Altman's style of overlapping dialogue can be frustrating; at first it was hard to understand what was being said because everyone talks at the same time or mumbles and sutitles are a must, but it's still fun to soak up the atmosphere of the filthy rich who find everything just too, too boring.

1674247,4,B00005V7CT,"In a screenplay by Julian Fellowes, and through the imaginations of Bob Balaban and the late director, Robert Altman, viewers find themselves transported to the upper crust society of 1932 England, where  the devious Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his elegant and aristocratic, but cold wife,Lady Sylvia(Kristen Scott Thomas) host variegated guests at their country estate for a weekend shooting party.
  Young Mary Maceachran(Kelly Macdonald)accompanies her employer, Constance, the Countess of Trenham (Dame Maggie Smith)to her niece's estate, encountering actor/singer/composer, Ivor Novello, Sir William's second cousin (an amiable and very gifted Jeremy Northam), on the road with friend and producer, Morris Weissman (a crude Bob Balaban) en route to the same destination.
  Others arriving at the estate on that rainy November day include the hostess' sisters Louisa and Lavinia(Geraldine Sommerville, Natasha Wightman) and Lord Stockbridge and Commander Meredith (Charles Dance and Tom Hollander). The McCordle's daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), greets her suitor, Lord Rupert Standish (Lawrence Fox), who is accompanied by his friend, Mr. Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford). The Nesbitts, Freddie and Mabel (James Wilby and Claudey Blakely) are a couple who happen to be broke, and their relationship is tense and volatile.
 The butler, Jennings (Alan Bates) greets the guests at the entrance and directs the servants upon their arrival. Indoors, the downstairs set are directed by Mrs. Wilson ( Helen Mirren), the chief housekeeper. The other notable servants in this drama include Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), Probst, the valet (Derek Jacobi), Robert Parks (a subtly charismatic Clive Owen) a gauche and mysterious Henry Denton(Ryan Phillippe)who tries to seduce Mary at one point, and head housemaid, Elsie (a hard-bitten Emily Watson), who, like more than one before her,  knows her employer quite intimately.
  During an afternoon tea, Novello finds himself at the receiving end of Constance's caustic views of his career, but also on the receiving end of Mabel's admiration.
  In the style and tradition of episodes of ""Mystery"" and ""Masterpiece Theater"", we are led through the upper crust rituals of formal dinners, games of pool, and the shooting party itself.
  After one of many scandalous  secrets is revealed, Novello is called to ease the tension by playing a few numbers. ""I Can Give You the Starlight"" was composed seven years after this story takes place. Yet despite this inaccuracy, I found myself glad it was included. The piano stylings of Jeremy Northam and/or his brother, Christopher liven things up more than a little, and the well-enunciated, Broadway-ish singing voice of the former, allegedly developed during a real-life stint as a singing waiter, is a pleasant one. Watching the servants dance to the distant sound of his tunes is priceless, emphasizing the spontaneous joy of the downstairs set.
  When the host is found dead in his study, with his ever-present dog close at hand, the reaction of those present is one of temporary stunned surprise and horror, even by the widow.
 Stephen Fry's Inspector Thompson is called in, along with assistant Constable Dexter (Ron Webster).
 While some tears are shed, generally, the crisis is met with stereotypical British reserve, as the widow and daughter entertain their guests clad in mourning. But more unflattering secrets about the departed are revealed, along with the pretentiousness of some of the upstairs set. Constable Dexter's summary of this world is one of dead-on precision: ""It's a poisonous paradise.""
  Soon, many of those involved find themselves making life-altering choices, and those unable to do so are left to new dilemmas and/or to their grief--not just over the deceased, but also in several instances, to issues pertaining to his treatement of them.
 The reprise of Novello's ""The Land of Might-Have-Been"" proves a fitting conclusion for the piece-- a sweet and sour slice of upper-crust life of a by-gone era, that makes fine viewing for quiet evenings in.",1217635200,,4073,5.402843601895735
1674248,5,B00005V7CT,"This film can be seen many times and each time, you see something you missed the time before. Both of the commentaries are fascinating. The screenwriter has experienced knowing people who really lived like this, so he is very interesting to listen to. The cast is filled with excellent actors, who, I think, took smaller parts because they wanted to work in a Robert Altman film and they are sublime. No one ever puts a foot wrong. Watch facial expressions and ""thrown away"" remarks, that are really vital to the story. I would suggest putting on the ""caption"" feature so you can follow the story while listening to the commentaries, or even to be sure you know what the Scottish Mary Maceachran (Maggie Smith's lady's maid) is saying or any other British speech pattern that may be unfamiliar to your ear. Watch for Meg Wynn Owen, who plays Lady Sylvia's lady's maid- she played Hazel Bellamy in the ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" series back in the 1970's (a matchless series, in my opinion- don't miss it). Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister) is quietly perfect as Dorothy, the still room maid, who worships Jennings, the butler. She played a perfectly silly woman in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral""- she was the second bride, but she really shows her acting chops in this film. Watch for the ""strawberry jam"" scene with Tom Hollander and her speech about the meaning of love, even though your love isn't returned. I couldn't recommend it more. Jeremy Northam plays Ivor Novello (look him up on Google- Jeremy even looks a little like him) in a small part but played beautifully. Altman said he threw in the ""F"" word enough times so it would keep 14 year old boys out of the film when it showed in theaters; I don't think it would have been a problem. 14 year old boys wouldn't have been tempted and they wouldn't have understood it- in fact, I doubt if most men would get the point. They would have been looking at their watches hoping it would end soon. People who like the era and all the layers of detail will love it, I am sure. 5 stars from me, though I am a complete and utter Anglophile. You can't go wrong with an Altman film, in any case. It's also a good ""escape"" movie- takes you away from one's daily problems for a couple of hours- make some microwave popcorn and some iced tea (or a pot of hot tea!) and kick back.

1674249,5,B00005V7CT,"As has been stated by so many reviewers before me, ""Gosford Park"" is a wonderfully written, acted, produced, and most importantly directed piece of cinema history. It comprises a truly stellar cast all delivering solid performances in astonishing surroundings. Especially is the effulgence of the great Maggie Smith hard to ignore.

Other reviewers have described the plot in fine detail, so I shant bother you with that. I'll get straight to the important bits: the directing. Robert Altman was, in my opinion, one of only a couple of directors who could have made ""Gosford Park"" in a proper way. The character driven story is made believable through his unique style. Especially the dialogue, which bears his trademark clatter, chatter, and ambient noise, really gives the impression that we are in a real, busy household with lots of things to take care of and all the rest of it. You really have to concentrate to hear what they are all saying, and still you're probably going to miss some things. Yet this is what makes the film work so well. It plays on the gossip that drives both the upper and the lower classes. On the rumours, the hearsay, the beliefs.

The writing of course is equally good. Great characters and witty dialogue. I am laughing out loud every time I see this film. It is funny but not ridiculous, it is dramatic, but not shakespearean. It is, in a word, great.",1208908800,,1386,4.746887966804979
1674250,5,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman's 2001 Academy Award-winning ""Gosford Park"" defies easy characterization.  Nominally a closed house English murder mystery taking place during a 1930's weekend shooting party at a country estate, it features a huge cast of developed characters, a variety of colliding subplots, and highly detailed period sets.  Shot in typical Altman style, the camera ranges upstairs among the aristocrats and downstairs among the servants.  There is so much going on that the actual murder almost gets lost in the near chaos.

Each of the guests gathering at Sir William McCorkle's (Michael Gambon) estate for the weekend shooting party has an agenda.  Many are financially dependent to one degree or another on the coarse and selfish McCorkle. Rivalries are fought out in politely understated but often vicious conversations.  Much of the story is told through the eyes of the servants below stairs, headed by Alan Bates as the head butler and Helen Mirren in a magnificent turn as the housekeeper.  Each of the servants has his or her stoutly defended place in the hierarchy of the house, and his or her own secrets, which are suspensefully doled out over the course of the film.  Clive Owen, a valet with an attitude, will turn out to have both a leading role and surprising connections with several members of the household.  Kelly McDonald, as a young lady's maid learning her trade serving a waspish but financially needy Countess played by Maggie Smith, provides an innocent viewpoint on much of the goings-on.

The murder itself is something of an afterthought, ineptly investigated by a pompous police inspector (in a typically humorous performance by Stephen Fry).  Its solution will play out among members of the household in unexpected ways that have little to do with law enforcement.

This is a challenging film to watch.  Viewers will want to take advantage of the extra features on this DVD for more insight into what is going and how ""Gosford Park"" was put together.  It is in the end a highly entertaining movie, most apt to appeal to fans of Robert Altman's unique movie-making style and to fans of ensemble British movies.",1204156800,,2142,5.0141242937853105

Some of the dialogue is unintelligible, especially when it is delivered by people pretending to be from Scotland.  And at the end, when three people ""rip off their masks,"" so to speak, and are really other people, the dialogue is so clumsy that if you look the other way for a second you'll miss the plot summation.

The Lord has the right to have as many affairs with the female servants as he wants. He has the right to have as many children with these female servants as he wants and then to have the babies abandoned and sent to orphanages. Absolutely disgusting. And what's more he may keep the servants for further use eventually. When we know that we know the murder of the Lord will be accepted by everyone in his own social class as justified, that they will cover it up for the police not to find out the murderer. And what's more they will have been backboneless enough not to murder him themselves and let the servants murder him. Here Robert Altman imagines a thriller that becomes a vicious denunciation of the deepest hypocrisy you can imagine, that of the British aristocracy. There is little to add to this tale, except that all in all only the servants have the human dignity that provides them with some human feelings, including for the son that has managed to survive and is condemned to remain officially unknown. It is also the servants who have the liking and taste for the Hollywood sentimental and sentimentalese songs that are sung for the entertainment of the ladies and gentlemen who treat that music as some charming accompaniment for their simmering hatred of the world and themselves. Of course Altman also manages to put one note against the Americans in the two characters from California, one having a typically non-Anglo-Saxon name, viz. Weissman. They are vicious enough to infiltrate the servant quarters just for the sake of a film on the very same situation, hence to guarantee the realism of the servants' side of the film. But they are also gross enough to reveal the subterfuge before the end and that reveals too how much the servants hate this indiscretion that reveals their side of ,the household to someone from the other side of the household. The gap between the two social classes that live along to one another in this mansion is wider than the distance between the earth and the moon.

Being that it is Hellen Mirren time after the last academy awards, I was able to really focus in on her performance which is excellent in Gosford Park.  The movie is somewhat difficult due to Altman's use of multiple characters talking at the same time.  His technique; however, is pretty close to everyday life, so it is just a matter of focusing in.

Beyond the movie's cheerful performances, the neat twist here that Altman and screenwriter Julian Fellowes's turn is on class distinctions, internal hierarchies within classes, and how members of those classes cannot keep from intersecting with one another.

Stepping away from his usual canvas and setting foot confidently in England of the 1930's, Altman gets a lot of use out a large, capable cast that he no doubt drew together in part on the strength of who he was as a filmmaker. Telling its tale of a days-long gathering for a shooting party on a country estate, and doing a fine job of depicting the immensity of complications such events impose on the lives of those who truly bring it all together, the serving classes, Altman makes use of a slick and subtle inside joke in that every scene of the movie takes place only when at least one servant is in the shot. What starts off as a depiction of the logistics concerning the feeding, lodging, and care of an already by the `30's vaguely anachronistic gathering of upper-crust English society types gradually becomes instead a murder mystery a la Agatha Christie at her best. Far less about the people ""upstairs"" than the more personally substantial folk below, Gosford Park reveals itself degree by degree until revelations about furtive love, buried secrets, smoldering hatred, and hot-blooded murder come to light.

Gosford Park is a magnificent country estate owned by Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his bored trophy wife Lady Sylvia (Kirstin Scott Thomas) they have extended a hand of hospitality to their relations and friends to join them for a shooting party weekend. People of consequences gather for a bit of sucking up, bringing their personal valets and maids behind them to jump to their every whim. For life above stairs Lords, Ladies and any other hangers on all seem locked in their own boredom flocking and circling like vultures trying to remain civil to others while flushing out their position and rank in society and excising it whenever possible. Everyone  has one mission for the weekend to see how rich they can stay, so they can remain to keep their life of boredom. Above stairs is full of talk; each eccentric visitor has their own story.....and a motive.

Meanwhile in the kitchens and corridors below-stairs the servants run around for the comfort of their employees, filled to the brim with bustling mess, gossip and duties all keeping them extremely busy. While some servant's duties bring them above stairs they remain discreet and in their place, although their all eyes and ears they pretend in front of the upper curst that their antics just didn't happen. Again below stairs every servant has their own skeletons and story.

Events of the weekend begin to bridge generations, class, sex and personal tragedy this finally leads to a midnight murder, the fact being it's a whodunit but the real question lingers in the whole household, Does anyone seem bothered?

My Notes on the Film

Directed by Robert Altman, I love this film it's just wonderful; before I go any further into the mention of cast, I must add Gosford Park is meant to be a satirical film although I didn't realize that until I got into the film, I begun to treat it as just that, although part comedy and part murder mystery the focus of this film is based on the characters and every character has their moment in this film. It's about the goings on above and below stairs in the 1930's with many, many stories of different lives weaved into it, best thing to do would be to sit back and enjoy it, let the film and story line wash over you. Although there is a murder, let that take the back seat with so much else flowing through this film the murder takes the smallest role let it remain a piece of irony.

Cast

Where do I begin.... fantastic cast, a lot of British acting talent in this film, two wonderful actress really stood out, (The Two English Dames)  Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith both excelled their talents in this film Mirren portrays Mrs Wilson the perfect servant who's a respected embittered housekeeper and Maggie Smith as Constance, the cash strapped Grand Dame. From the male leads a stand out for me was Jeremy Northam portraying the suave visiting celebrity Ivor Novello his just marvellous.

The rest of the cast would be either British or American, all are equally brilliant, pulling together to keep it really entertaining, some faces are more familiar than others Ryan Phillippe, Eileen Atkins, Alan Bates, Kelly Macdonald, Richard E Grant, Clive Owen, Derek Jacobi, Emily Waston, Kirstin Scott Thomas, Michael Gambon, Charles Dance, even Stephen Fry makes a small apperance, The whole cast in this film even the new I have not named would be a great talent to watch.

Robert Altman I praise for doing a wonderful job to this film and Julian Fellows for the screenwriting, Sometimes with a lot of great talent in one film it doesn't always seem to work but for this film it certainly does.

1674274,4,B00005V7CT,"Directed by Robert Altman, this film take place in the English country side of the 1930s at the lavish and beautiful estate known as Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas) host a large, weekend hunting party for a distinguished assemblage of guests, who arrive accompanied by their downstairs entourage.

It soon becomes clear that the film revolves around a hodge podge of subplots and intrigues, both upstairs and downstairs, some of which are quite interesting, others seemingly less so. They all become pertinent, however, when one of them is murdered by someone in their midst. The film plays as if it were a more upscale and lavish version of the PBS series ""Mystery"" or as a film based upon an Agatha Christie mystery.

The cast is stellar with excellent performances by all. Maggie Smith is outstanding in the role of Constance Trentham, a snobby, self-absorbed, old biddy in need of money, so that she can continue the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Jeremy Northam is wonderful playing matinee idol, Ivor Novello, and continues to extend his range, as this role requires him to sing, which he does quite credibly, in fact.

Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins are superlative as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, and the cook, Mrs. Croft, who are, apparently, at war with each other. Richard E, Grant, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson, and Kelly MacDonald are wonderful as part of the core of downstairs folks through whose eyes the viewer see events unfold.

Stephen Fry deserves mention for his brief, though memorable, turn as the laid back Inspector Thompson, whose bumbling investigative efforts seem almost sure to leave the murder unsolved. The audience, however, knows who did it by film's end, even though Inspector Thompson appears not to have a clue.

The cinematography is beautiful, as it captures the sumpuousness and richness of the upstairs life in the manor home. It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two. The gulf is further delineated by one of the subplots, which sees the character played by Ryan Phillippe gamely straddle both worlds.

The one small problem I found with the film is that, because there are so many characters with their own subplots and intrigues, the film is somewhat confusing at times. Moreover, some of the dialogue is occasionally unintelligible and garbled, due to overlapping dialogue, which was a bit annoying. Watching the DVD with the English subtitles feature on, however, would probably resolve this issue.

The DVD offers a number of interesting features, including an enjoyable mini- ducumentary of Altman's efforts to ensure authenticity of period detail. They apparently hired a cook, a butler, and a maid who were in service during the early nineteen thirties as a sort of sounding board as to how things were done. It also features two commentaries, as well as a short on the making of Gosford Park. It is a value packed DVD and well worth the money.

REVISION: I thought I should tell more of the story, so here goes:

An aristocratic English family (1920s) assembles at the patriarch's estate for a bird hunt and weekend get-together. Most of the male family members are stogy, snooty buffons, but the women of the family have their eye on the (money) ball.

The servants, some incredibly shrewd and some sheepish, mostly live vicariously through the lives of their masters. But a few have agendas and the interactions of the family with the servants is incredibly meshed but still quite coherent.

The old patriarch is murdered after he has ticked off nearly every family member in the household -- there is no shortage of suspects!

The snobbery and the bitching displayed was so very upper class English. For an anglophile like myself, who loves English books , this movie was delightful.

The plot structure for the murder mystery was a bit weak. The explanation given for the murder was a bit far fetched. I won't say her why I think its fat fetched because in doing so, I will have to give the plot away.",1152662400,,662,4.6581196581196584

1674278,5,B00005V7CT,"The upperclass friends and relations of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) arrive at his country house for a weekend of shooting, accompanied by maids, footmen, and valets, all of whom will be staying under one roof. Sir William is a mean-spirited and self-centered old man, married to a much younger, emotionally distant wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), with many family members dependent upon his continuing largesse. The hilariously waspish Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), who believes she has a lifetime stipend, arrives with young Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald), who is trying valiantly to become a good lady's maid. Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), a Hollywood star, and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a producer of Charlie Chan movies, are the only guests without aristocratic backgrounds and inherited privilege. The atmosphere of the house, filled with venomous ""friends"" and relations, soon becomes even more poisonous.

The ""below stairs"" lives of the servants are also fully revealed, as they share living quarters, eat meals together, tend to the laundry and cooking, and gossip about their employers. The butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren) run the household and try to guarantee that no real-world cares will intrude upon the lives of their employers. Since ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" occasionally meet very privately at night, secrets abound, many of them secrets of long standing. When Sir William is poisoned and stabbed (""Trust Sir William to be murdered twice""), nearly everyone has a motive for wanting him dead.

For director Robert Altman, the primary focus of the film is on the characters, their way of life, and their values, with the murder mystery secondary. Set in late November, the end of the year 1932, the action takes place when this secure aristocratic lifestyle is also nearing its end, something that the arrival of the newly rich Hollywood characters, Novello and Weissman, illustrates. Dramatic cinematography (by Andrew Dunn) emphasizes the cold and rainy dreariness of the weekend, and suggests parallels with the coldness of the dying aristocracy.

Interior shots reveal the contrasts between the elegant and mannered lives of the ""upstairs"" characters and the hardworking daily lives of the ""downstairs"" characters, who adhere to their own rigid social codes. Every detail rings true, and as the characters' lives and interrelationships are revealed obliquely in brief snippets of seemingly unrelated conversations, a broad picture of the upstairs and downstairs lifestyles gradually emerges. Fully developed, many-leveled, wonderfully acted, often funny, and impeccably directed and filmed, this is a film one can watch again and again with delight.

It seems everyone who loves Gosford Park has laid out all the right reasons for it (brilliant acting, character development, the 'haves' interfacing with the 'have nots', intellectually stimulating) and those who hate it have cited their reasons, as well (stuffy, slow, tedious, boring). That being said, I will make this short and sweet, for the benefit of those who may stumble upon my humble opinion and are considering watching this film for the first time:

If you like Gosford Park, there's a good chance you enjoy reading, you like playing chess, you are interested in a good documentary, appreciate fine wine and like your sex slow.

If you dislike this movie because you think it is boring and hopelessly confusing, there is a good chance you almost never read (TV Guide and People magazine excepted), you think professional wrestling is real, you think Maya Angelou is a brilliant poet, you prefer Budweiser out of a can and you can't sit still for any movie for more than 10 minutes unless it has violence, nudity, foul language and/or awesome special effects.

1674281,5,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park was directed and conceived by the great Robert Altman.  As in so many Altman movies, the cast is composed of many well known actors.  In this case it works, the plot is well constructed and the screenplay well executed.  It behooves the viewer to take time to watch the first hour of the movie as it painstakingly lays down the foundation of the story and establishes the characters--this is not a thriller that will rocket you from scene to scene.  It is an old-fashioned mystery crafted by a master film-maker.

The story unfolds over several days of shooting in a beautiful country mansion in England during the 1930's.  The class system still holds sway in this setting where many of the guests bring their own personal servants.  The problematic nature of the relationship between the haves and have-nots is the central problem  of the story and results in murder.

Among many fine performances is Maggie Smith, a dagger tongued elderly harpy who can be heard in almost any scene languidly complaining about everything.  Derek Jacoby is touching in the few moments he is seen on screen.  Stephen Fry is unctiously amusing as a bumbling inspector, though he does chew the scenery a bit.  Helen Mirren provides her usual amazingly adept performance, playing the iron-fisted housekeeper whose emotions are kept out of sight except to us, her audience.

Good performances do abound and the methodical plot moves ever so surreptitiously and comes to some very interesting revelations.

1674283,5,B00005V7CT,"Not to be a snob, like so many of the characters in this great film, but I can see where not that many American viewers will like this movie.  I loved it, but I don't think myself too representative of the typical American moviegoer.

First of all, the storyline is slow moving, subtle and moves in many directions at once.  Most American multiplex offerings tend to hit you over the head with heavy-handed action, plot twists, fewer actors, fewer subplots, and more (but less subtle) drama.

While I found the acting in ""Gosford Park"" excellent, especially Maggie Smith's portrayal of a snobby old lady who loves to look down on everyone around her, many lines can get lost in a soundtrack teeming with overlapping dialogue and British and other accents.  (I cheated by turning on the subtitles, and it helped me to catch things I probably would have missed.)

For me, much of the movie's appeal stemmed from the many ironies depicted and the viewer's familiarity with British and European history in the decades ahead while the characters are stuck in their 1930s worldview, unaware, for instance, of the coming Second World War, the end of British colonialism, and the general decline of Britain's position in the world.  I also liked the way Altman takes a well-worn movie genre, stands it on its head and uses it to make observations about a class of people few of us are truly familiar with but have plenty of preconceptions about, and their behavior and relationships to each other and especially their treatment of servants, all while making a whodunit that would have done Agatha Christie proud.

Altman has given us an entertaining and insightful movie.  Unfortunately, it's a movie that not that many American viewers will ever appreciate for the masterpiece of irony and subtlety that it is because not many have heard of it, and few will ever be willing to take the time to watch it.

My only quibble is that the end comes perhaps too quickly and quietly -- well, I am an American myself, after all -- and seems almost anticlimactic.  I felt like it was just about to get REALLY good, when suddenly it was over.",1143504000,4,2124,4.7289972899729

It shows people with different social status and with a wide range of backgrounds, all gathered and Sir William McCordle's mansion for a grouse shooting party (during the weekend).

Among the the servants, gossip flows wildly, whilst the guests go on with their affairs and their rumping. After all the charming mumbling and dribble, Sir William is murdered. Not that anyone misses him, except Elsie, the maid, with whom he had an affair.

Charming film for people like me, who love samples of best thing in Britain: high society mumbling.

This film is not one of Agatha Christie's ""whodunnit"" sort, it is more like something that began in that way, but it got ""twisted"", in Altman's so caractheristic way.

His impeccable narrative style, that wonderful movements of camera, the discretely sumptuous stage, the fabulous illumination, the acid handle of the script, the prodigious domain of the British mood, the polish and refined cynicism beneath some lines, and obviously the special care of selection of every one of the characters make of this film an absolute artistic feat.

The movie follows the great tradition of Agatha Christie ` novels. Altman takes all the time of the world to show every  one of the personages, their affections and emotive lacks are depicted with unerring clarity. The theatrical mood reveals his deep love for this artistic expression. You can realize how the camera keeps always at a discrete distance from the viewer. All of you know the efficacy to use the staircase as dramatic device and natural frontier between the well defined social classes. This will be precisely the accurate place in which we will tie clues, being able to listen the most hidden thoughts, desires or sudden dates.

It is a superb chamber work, an immense Adagio where all of us must participate in this smart game of shadowy complicities, those little details that progressively will be enhancing the whole canvas.

Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson and Cliff Owen are fabulous in superlative grade. Because all the cast was splendid too. The zealous search of the artistic direction shines along the film.

There is not any detail to reject. This is a towering, egregious and majuscule film and from its immediate release, a new classic.

I read in a previous review that the movie is dumb and predictable. Obviously, that reviewer prefers SMART and non-formula movies like 'Stealth'! PUH-LEASE!
  Gosford Park is EXCELLENTLY scripted, and is not a typical Hollywood-type mystery at all. It will have you TRULY guessing until the very end. In addition, the cast is AMAZING, and the acting is beyond first-rate. Do not expect lame unrealistic Hollywood-type action scenes. This movie portrays the aftermath of a murder pretty realistically. Gosford Park makes my all-time Top 10 Movies list.
  More than likely, if you love the yearly 'summer blockbuster' that Hollywood churns out (again, like 'Stealth'), you are a lemming, and will think Gosford Park is boring. You will not like it. However, if you hate how many dumb movies Hollywood makes these days, then give Gosford Park a try. You WILL love this movie.
  One final note: The movie is set in England, and utilizes English and Scottish actors, complete with real accents. If you find it hard to understand accents, you may find it helpful to watch the movie with the subtitles on, as the soundtrack has a very real-life feel to it, with many conversations overlapping each other. The subtitles are quite good, and will help you hear all the nuances of the coversations.

1674288,5,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is a big English country house in the early 1930s. It is inhabited by William McCordle (Michael Gambon), his wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott-Thomas) and their daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford). William and Sylvia's not very happy marriage is a fairly flagrant exchange of financial prosperity for social standing as prior to it she was immensely posh but broke, while he was not posh at all but extremely rich thanks to the factories he owns. They are hosting a weekend social gathering to do a spot of shooting and have invited mainly her relatives, his being presumably too common. The exception is his cousin Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) who belongs to the new Hollywood aristocracy (not that that cuts much social ice hereabouts - the servants are overawed, their masters sniffy) and his film director friend from Hollywood Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban) who has got himself invited along with a view to researching a planned movie about toffs together with the later's valet Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe). Also along are Sylvia's sister Louisa Stocksbridge (Geraldine Somerville) accompanied by her arrogantly patrician war hero husband Raymond (Charles Dance) and his valet Robert Parks (Clive Owen); her other sister Lavinia (Natasha Wightman) rather less successfully married off to the weak and financially straightened Anthony (Tom Hollander) who is as desperate to get William to invest in his schemes for a boot factory in the Sudan as William is determined to do no such thing; her nephew Freddie Nesbit who is also in dire straits for money and divides his time between sucking up to William in the hope of being offered employment and bullying his wife Mabel (Caudie Blakely), who has also been married for her money, but having had less that was hoped, is now treated with merciless scorn and contempt; Sylvia's stingy and supercilious aunt Constance Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her maid Mary MacCeachran (Kelly MacDonald).  That's about it upstairs about from a couple of additional young fellows Lord Rupert Standish (Laurence Fox) and Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford) who show up late and never really integrate successfully into either the social gathering or the film except that the former seems to have his eye on Isobel or at least what she stands to inherit inheritance.

You might perhaps think that was already complicated enough. But in the meantime Parks and Maceachran arrive downstairs to find themselves in the midst of a huge army of servants presided over by housekeeper Mrs Wilson (Helen Mirren) and alcoholic butler Jennings (Alan Bates) prominent among whom are head cook Mrs Croft (Eileen Atkins); head housemaid (and William's mistress), Elsie (Emily Watson), William's valet Probert (Derek Jacobi), the lecherous footman George (Richard E. Grant) and the nymphomaniac kitchen maid Dorothy (Sophie Thompson). All this huge array of people mingle, gossip, intrigue their way though an evening and the following day until, the second evening, Sir William turns up murdered in his study, bringing the law onto the scene in the form of the drolly moronic Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) and his rather less dimwitted underling Constable Dexter (Ron Webster).

Smith, Mirren, Gambon, Scott-Thomas, Jacobi, Bates, Dance, Watson, Grant, Atkins, Fry... Some cast. The British film A-list is very bit as talented as their American counterparts but, sadly for them, an awful lot less expensive, to the point where it is possible for a movie such as this to simply buy them all up as a huge job lot. All are perfectly cast and superb with the exception I fear of Fry whose bumbling clod of an Inspector is mildly amusing but completely unbelievable and belongs in a very different, less serious and naturalistic sort of comedy than is this: like Geraldine Chalplin in 'Nashville' he is the comic touch that doesn't really work. In such a sprawling typically Altmanesque ensemble piece it should be impossible for any actor to dominate but happily no one has explained this to Maggie Smith whose magnificently funny performance effortlessly steal the movie.

It's a hugely enjoyable movie superbly put together. Altman has much with age. It lacks the satirical savagery of a `Nashville' or a `Short Cuts' and a clearly deeply critical take on the puffery, snobbery and often terrible cruelty of this ferociously hierarchical class system is tempered and slightly undermined by a slight but definitely perceptible unmistakeable nostalgic sneaking regard for this nice stable ordered but clearly dying world where everybody knew where they belonged and (mostly) stayed there. So it's an at once contemptuous and affectionate, despairing and humane picture of a bunch of toffs and their servants in the years between the wars with a scene in the middle where they all go off shooting birds in the local woods: it's certainly natural to suppose all this involves considerably more than a nodding glance back to Renoir's `Rules of the Game'. If that is Altman's model of course he hasn't matched it but he's nonetheless made a richly intricate, intelligent and highly enjoyable film.",1130803200,19,5110,5.16043425814234
1674289,5,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman doesn't need to copy anyone.  The director of ""Nashville"" and the film version of ""M*A*S*H"" has a recognizable style that would serve as an excellent template for ensemble cast films. In Gosford Park he applies that wonderfully witty style to a production that initially looks like one of those wonderful Merchant-Ivory features with gentlemen in tuxedos and ladies in elegant gowns strolling around a British Manor.

The cast is chock-a-block full of gifted English performers - some of them recognizable to American viewers:  Maggie Smith, Ryan Phillippe, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon just before donning the long beard of Albus Dumbledore in the most recent Harry Potter films, Kristin Scott Thomas.  ""Look, there's.... whatsisname"" I thought often.

The story establishes a busy ""upstairs/downstairs"" feel as the rich and titled are invited to visit the manor of Bambon's Sir William McCordle for a shooting party. Those rich lords and ladies walk and talk and gossip upstairs while downstairs the equally interesting maids and butlers walk and talk and gossip.

About halfway through the film one of the titled is murdered and the rest of the film follows the outline of one of those Agatha Christie whodunits, but the richness and complexity of the characters and their interactions with one another are in a definite Altman style that make you care about these characters and whodunit in a way that is deeper than Dame Agatha's fine stories.  You find that half of the upstairs houseguests have a motive, and you discover the same about the servants downstairs.  The movie pays meticulous attention to the distinction between classes and position and income. Maggie Smith Sir William's Sister, Constance, is by position the Countess of Trentham, but she is completely dependent on her brother's allowance to maintain even the appearance of a lavish lifestyle.  The servants downstairs know that they are not in the class of those upstairs, but they are further divided in that their rank among the fellow servants is reflected by the rank of their employer.  At the servant's dinner table they are seated by the rank of their boss upstairs.  They are even called by the name of their employer.

Altman definitely differs from Christie in that you come to form sorts of emotional attachments to some of these characters. By the denouement you have come to care about what has happened, and the weight of whodunit has a depth that is far beyond simply ""who's going to jail"".  It's a rewarding way to spent a couple of hours.",1128729600,5,2543,5.026190476190476

Now he's become a cinematic sadist looking for a masochistic victim. If you watch ""Gosford Park"", you're the victim, and Altman is the leather-clad gimp.

""Gosford Park"", Robert Altman's self-referential and cleverer-than-thou deconstruction of Agatha Christie's great whodunits, is crammed to its Victorian manor home garrets with enough actors to stage a full-scale invasion of Normandy (and win!), obsessively detailed, and repulsively self-absorbed. This is a strange and decidedly post-modern mixture of all-Plot and no-Plot, a smirking deconstructionist manifesto masquerading as a 1930's murder mystery.

""Gosford Park"" doesn't entertain, thrill, or amuse: it bores. It is a new twist on cinema, to be sure: the Movie as Torture Device.

Roughly a million primary, secondary, and tertiary English characters and their servants converge on the remote English manor home of William and Sylvia McCordle (played in desperately work-manlike fashion by Michael Gambon and Kristin Scott Thomas, respectively) for an extended week-end of dining, mumbling, and grouse-shooting, with an extra serving of mumbling.

Our battalion of mumblers, Upper and Lower Class, maneuver around and about the ornately appointed chambers and elegantly manicured grounds of the Victorian manse, wheedling and plotting and whispering and, of course, mumbling. Elderly dame Constance Trentham (played acutely by Maggie Smith, who could do this sort of period dance in her sleep by now, and probably did) wheels whispering about the dining room and parlor of the estate, worrying about status and couth.

The hapless Meredith couple (Tom Hollander, Natasha Wightman, turning in fine roles as middle-class mumblers) are trying to wrangle a deal with the elderly, grumbling, blackhearted Lord McCordle. Lady Sylvia (Thomas) is wan, capricious, fickle and unhappy; Lord William (Gambon) is bellicose, loud, and rugose.

Everyone is unhappy. Everyone mumbles.

Downstairs the staff mumble, but in Cockney accents, so whereas the Upper class mumbling is understandable, the soupy Yorkshire-to-Southwark gurgles will doubtless cause you to curse and demand subtitles. Alas, no help is forthcoming, and you'll spend a few minutes rewinding the DVD to try, desperately and futilely, to figure out what that First Footman said. Or was it the 4th Beater? Never mind. You'll be so absorbed muddling through the accents and the mumbling it won't really matter.

There are a number of inevitable collisions between the gallant forces of Upstairs and the stolid and stoic servitors Downstairs as Things Come to a Head, portrayed through awkward pauses in dinnertime chit-chat (read: stilted mumbling punctuated by gasps) and startling revelations during tea-time at the McCordle Gazebo.

None of this makes for an interesting movie. Indeed, it makes for something approximating Hell on Earth.

""Gosford Park"" drowns in its own smug self-satisfaction, its endless mumbling, its dry-and-unaffected seminal murder sequence (presented almost as an afterthought), its muddle-headed and moronic Scotland Yard investigator (played foolishly by the great and underrated Stephen Fry, who sinks without a cry in this murky soup), and its anti-climactic ""conclusion"".

This is not to say that the ""Gosford Park"" ship sinks without a mighty effort from its crew. The captain may be drunk at the helm, but the acting is terrific throughout, in spite of the mumbling: Dame Maggie Smith entrances as always, Kristin Scott Thomas does wonders with her thankless role, Michael Gambon rages and goes not softly into the dying of the Light, Helen Mirren is an oasis of dignity and desperate reserve, Derek Jacobi carves out precious little slices of the film and makes them his own, and the great Charles Dance and the inimitable Richard Grant do what they can with the material they have.

I will also admit that the world of ""Gosford Park"" is handsomely mounted---like most dead wild beasts that have been shot and stuffed---and kudos go to Director of Photography Andrew Dunn (who stirred up the bewitching cinematography in ""The Madness of King George III"" and ""Count of Monte Cristo""), set designer Anna Pinnock (who moved on to ""Van Helsing"") and costume design by Jenny Beavan, (""Alexander"") and has about a million Jane Austen treatments under her belt. Everything looks smashing.

Alas, ""smashing"" isn't the word that comes to mind about the larger work of ""Gosford Park"". 'Dull' is. For a movie that demands this much of its audience, ""Gosford Park"" really doesn't seem to care that much about its plot, its characters, or its resolution---and certainly not its audience.

To those who want to see the British class system skewered, buy ""Upstairs/Downstairs"". To those looking for some ghoulishness mixed in with their rich Edwardian atmosphere, pick up ""Clue"" or ""The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes"".

To those who want to lose more than two hours of their life to a mumbling, plotless, aimless and colorless British costume drama helmed by a director who has seen better days, pick up ""Gosford Park"". Just don't say you weren't warned in advance.

I would rather have someone drive red-hot pokers into both of my eyes than ever watch this vile thing again.

1674294,5,B00005V7CT,"A weekend in a fabulous mansion of the countryside between blue-blood aristocrats and a murder is the perfect excuse to reunite to one of the most talented groups of British actors in the new film of Robert Altman, Gosford Park.

In this acute social satire, the veteran director presents/displays the exaggerated pretentiousness of the English high class and the relations between masters and servants, outlining clearly the values and opposed attitudes of each class.

Completely narrated from the point of view of the servants, Gosford Park is an acute observation of the division of classes that characterized England in the thirties.

In 1932, Gosford Park is the magnificent house of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, the glamorous Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas). To a weekend celebration that includes hunting and abundant banquets attend a spoiled countess (Maggie Smith), a movie producer (Bob Balaban), a matinee idol (Jeremy Northam) and the sisters of Lady Sylvia.

Under the sumptuous rooms of the rich, the austere floors of the help contain a group so impressive as the one above, which includes Jennings, the main butler (Alan Bats), Sir William's valet (Sir Derek Jacobi) and the other help members who come with their masters, from the suspect Harry Denton (Ryan Phillipe) to the ingenuous Mary (Kelly MacDonald). All the personnel are supervised by Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the cook (Eileen Atkins) and Elsie (Emily Watson).

The story goes on between the financial and sexual goings and comings of the masters and their servants. Plots and subplots are mere instruments so these characters receive their dose of scandal, gadgets, rumors, treason, sexual tension and murder.

Altman, specialist in films with long casts, demonstrates that he hasn't lost his spark and playfulness. For each laughter and playful moment, there's a dark and surprise turn. Gosford Park is so jammed of guests and servants, that the disappearance of a knife goes unnoticed, until it appears in the chest of one of the main characters.

But to explore the criminal genre is clearly not Altman's intention; rather it is to make fun of it. The clues are so obvious and the clumsy detective (Stephen Fry) is so obtuse that he destroys more evidence than the ones he collects. As to be expected, there's more than one suspect, and no character is 100% innocent. Not the one upstairs and much less those downstairs. Everybody is guilty, because everybody has a secret.",1116547200,,2485,5.120987654320988
1674295,5,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is a fabulous English film about a day in the lives of a bunch of aristocrats and the lower working class servants. The all-star ensemble features many A-list serious English actors including some of my favorites Emily Watson(house maid), Kristin Scott Thomas(the wife of a wealthy man), Helen Mirren(the housekeeper), and Maggie Smith(a super snob). Actually, Ryan Phillipe is also in it with a fake British accent. Other sophisticated character actors include Jeremy Northem, Clive Owen, Michael Gambon, and Stephen Fry as the police inspector.

The story is about the little things that goes on during the day while everyone is getting ready for a grand party. There are secrets and backstabbings between the two classes in the house. For instance, Emily Watson is secretly having an affair with her master/empolyer. Helen Mirren is withholding her true identity from the son who never knew her. Kristin Scott Thomas is cheating on her husband. The seemingly worry-free Maggie Smith might have to face finiancial problems if her sponsor stops giving her allowances. Then someone gets murdered and the houseful of guests and staffs all panic....

This film received numerous Oscar nominations, and both Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren were competitors in the best supporting actress cateogory. I think Smith was brilliant, because she really captured the essence of her character, but it's an unlikeable one. Helen Mirren stood out when she had her breakdown later in the film. She did a great job holding herself together until she couldn't take it anymore.

I enjoyed this film tremendously, because it's funny, dramatic, suspenseful, and touching. It's very entertaining for a period English film, and it's one of my favorite Robert Altman film.",1115596800,,1761,5.23758865248227
1674296,5,B00005V7CT,"Director Robert Altman serves up an atypical drama/whodunit, set on an English country estate, the ""Gosford Park"" of the title, during a weekend of pheasant hunting. The superb ensemble cast gives outstanding performances, and an in-depth glimpse of the British class system. Multiple plots and subplots are woven together seamlessly to provide taut suspense, fascinating character studies, and various suspects and motives for the murder of a man killed twice. We are also given more than a glimpse of lives led both Upstairs and Downstairs, and the snobbery and pecking order which exist on all levels.

Set in the early 1930's, Sir William McCordle, (Michael Gambon), and his wife, the much younger, acrimonious Lady Sylvia, (Kristin Scott Thomas), entertain a group of aristocrats, and non-titled social climbers, for a shooting party. The guests arrive with their servants in tow. Lady Sylvia despises her husband for his lack of blue blood, love of money and lecherous ways. She takes her pleasure elsewhere. Intrigue, rivalry, venomous feelings, envy, and sexual escapades abound on all floors of the manse, and gossip is rampant and delicious. Maggie Smith is wonderful as the Countess of Trentham, who peers through her lorgnette and tosses-off barbed comments at one and all - except the man who holds the purse strings. She is dependent on Sir William for her allowance, which he threatens to put a halt to. Ivor Novello, (Jeremy Northam), is a Hollywood movie star and English matinee idol. A distant relation of the McCordles, he was invited on the condition that he entertain the other guests with music and song. He accepts in order to wangle an invitation for his colleague, American movie producer, Morris Weissman, (Bob Balaban). Weissman, who spends most of the movie on the telephone, talking long distance with honchos in Hollywood, is researching the lives of the rich and infamous for an upcoming film, ''Charlie Chan in London.""

Below stairs, head housemaid Elsie, (Emily Watson), spontaneously outs herself as Sir William's lover. Helen Mirren gives an exceptional performance as the head housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, ""the perfect servant. The seemingly naive Mary Macearchran, (Kelly Macdonald), is the Countess' lady's maid. She is much more astute and observant than anyone would give her credit for. Stephen Fry is funny as the police inspector, of the Clouseau school of sleuthing, and provides comic relief. This is entertainment at its best.

""Gosford Park,"" written by Julian Fellowes from a concept by Mr. Altman and Bob Balaban, won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. Amazingly, Altman was 76 years-old when he made the film.

1674297,3,B00005V7CT,"I like things that are efficient and functional.  Gosford Park is not.  It is a long-winded tale about the servants of rich people and how they interact with their masters/mistresses.  Two vivid moments were both about how two people could have connected, but they did not because of the constraints of the service.  A mother and son were separated, and she decided not to say anything to the son who does not find out his mother is still alive.  They serve different masters.  A romance begins to sprout between a young girl and a young man, but in the end it only results in a single kiss.  Such brief moments of feelings not acted upon would be trite if not for the fact that they occur in the dull monotony of servanthood.  In such a context, the viewer is shown the power of such points of decisions in a character's life.  If you have the time, or if your girlfriend really wants to see it, it's okay.  But has my life been enriched by the Gosford experience?  Not enough to just watch it on my own.  Go learn about saving for retirement instead, I say.",1114819200,,1059,4.374358974358974
1674298,5,B00005V7CT,"Perusing the reviews for ""Gosford Park"" I wasn't surprised to see several complaints of boredom. It might sound stupid, but anyone who found this film boring is not Robert Altman's intended audience. Gosford Park is a masterpiece of subtlety and exquisite attention to detail; it requires patience and focus on the part of the viewer. The entertainment is there on the screen; it's up to the individual to discover it.

""Gosford Park"" succeeds in bringing together two completely different worlds that rarely, if ever, collide. The languid upstairs sphere hovers just above the much more crowded and lively below stairs universe. To watch the ballet dance between the two is to watch genius at work.",1114560000,2,699,5.078260869565217

1674300,4,B00005V7CT,"Sir William (Michael Gambon) and Lady Sylvia (Kirstin Scott Thomas) McCordle host a shooting party at their country home. During the weekend, the lives of the various servants and guest interact and have an impact on the weekend. Also, over the course of the weekend, Sir William is murdered and many people appear to have motive for the murders. Among the various guests: Countess Trentham (Maggie Smith), an elderly dowager and financial drain on Sir William, Lord and Lady Stockbridge (Charles Dance and Geraldine Sommerville), brother and sister-in-law of William, each of whom is interested in the McCordles, Ivor Novello (Jermey Northam), star of the Silent screen and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a Hollywood producer. The various servants include: Jennings (Alan Bates), the McCordle's butler, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the housekeeper, Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), the head cook, Probert (Derek Jacobi), Sir William's valet, Elsie (Emily Watson), a housemaid, George (Richard E. Grant), First Footman, Robert Parks (Clive Owen), Lord Stockbridge's valet and Henry Denton (Ryan Phillipe), M.r Weissman's valet.

""Gosford Park"", the newest film from director Robert Altman is a very engaging, very well-made film about the lives of these people. As the film progresses, you realize that the film is less about the murder that takes place over the weekend and more about the class differences between the two sets of people. It quickly becomes apparent that there really is no difference between the Upstairs and the Downstairs people. Certain people receive different treatment with respect to their birth and upbringing. Also, due to the amount of fooling around between the two groups, it seems fairly silly to have one person referred to as Lord or Lady when they are perfectly happy to jump into the sack with a footman or maid.

The fact that the mystery is not a primary factor is made very clear in two ways. Mr. Weissman (Bob Balaban) soon reveals that he is a producer of the Charlie Chan movies and is working on a new film called ""Charlie Chan in London"". He is asked to tell the group about it, but won't reveal the ending. As he describes the film, we realize that the film he is describing is the film we are watching. I don't know if you have ever seen a Charlie Chan film, but the outcome of these films is rarely based on any detective or police work. Soon, Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) enters the picture. A bumbling idiot, he is clearly overpowered by the class of people he is dealing with.

""Park"" is filled with virtually every British actor currently working and each is very good. The sheer magnitude of the characters would seem to suggest that many of them would end up being two dimensional. However, almost every character has something going on, which helps to define them and provide interest to the story. Certainly, some characters become more prevalent and integral to the story, but Altman has a way of bringing a character into the picture at just the right moment to renew our interest in them.

Maggie Smith is, as always, brilliant. As the elderly dowager, she uses her place and title to full advantage, and seems to love everything about her life, except for the size of her allowance. Just as she is commenting about the ineptitude of her personal maid, Mary Macreachran (Kelly McDonald), she makes an aside that she is very cheap, than goes on to talk about her state of financial affairs. Jeremy Northam and Bob Balaban provide the other standouts in the cast. Northam, playing Ivor Novello, an actual silent film star, seems genuinely perplexed by the state of his career and takes to singing one song after another. Bob Balaban plays Morris Weissman, a film producer from Hollywood, whom the kitchen staff soon finds out is a vegetarian.

The cast of actors playing the staff is generally more interesting. Alan Bates heads up the service staff as Jennings, the head butler. He maintains a tight grip on the household with the help of Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the housekeeper. Mirren brings an iron rule to the role but also makes the character sympathetic and interesting in small, interesting ways. Ms. Wilson and Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), the head cook, seem to have a small feud of power going on. Each character has secrets which are revealed in subtle ways. Clive Owen, as Stockbridge's valet, provides a quiet force in the servant's quarters and his presence eventually shakes things up. Derek Jacobi and Richard E. Grant also play members of the staff, adding to the mix.

Ryan Phillipe also appears in the film as the Scottish valet to Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban). At first, his accent seems very 'actorly', as though someone who studied the accent for a bit suddenly thinks they can do it. Another character comments on the accent and soon we realize that perhaps he is not everything he seems. Phillipe is OK, but he is outmatched by every other actor in the film both in skill and physical presence. It smacks of a desperate attempt by the filmmakers to attract a portion of the American audience that never would go to a film like this. As his character becomes more clear, it also appears as though the filmmakers are trying to create a plausible excuse for their own actions in casting him.

As the film progresses, Altman seemlessly weaves back and forth between the characters and their developing relationships, revealing little bits and then moving on. This manages to keep the cumbersome film and cast of characters fresh and to maintain our interest, while helping us identify the various players.

""Gosford Park"" is filled with interesting characters and very good performances, providing two hours of fun for everyone.",1113264000,4,5707,4.925155925155925
1674301,5,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is not a murder mystery, nor will it ever be one. It is the subtle exploration of human relationships and their interactions. Altman does this expertly, carefully highlighting the elegant dance of words, emotions, and body language. Altman explores the relationships between the servants and the served, the aristocrats to one who does everything from ""keep[ing] Ma Trentham in stockings and gin"" to paying for his father-in-law to ""swan around Biarritz six months out of the year."" The most interesting relationship, I believe, is that of Mabel Nesbitt to her husband, Freddie. Freddie regrets his marriage to Mabel, who is poorer than Freddie would like her to be. They fight, constantly, and I enjoy watching the relationship that Mabel develops to the movie star, Ivor Novello, also a guest. It's a one-way relationship, but her relationship best illustrates the subtle interplay between the characters in this film.

Some will undoubtedly find Gosford Park boring beyond belief--from a more superficial point, it IS a group of aristocrats talking and a group of servants talking. However, I see it differently. Every time I watch this film (best for rainy days to match the movie's mood) I notice something I didn't notice before. I'm probably on my 20th full viewing of it, and I'm still noticing the relationships, the hand gestures, the people in the background. The details in Gosford Park elegantly flesh out the film and make it a keeper, one worth watching several times over.",1112227200,3,1501,5.1016260162601625
1674302,5,B00005V7CT,"""Gosford Park"" is my idea of a perfect English country house murder mystery. It's set in 1932, and all the costumes are appropriate for that era. The scenery is gorgeous. The home is beautifully decorated and filled with fresh flowers. It could be Castle Howard. The interaction and dialogue between members of the family and guests sets up the plot, and is the same with and among servants. The dialogue between the actors follows on in the way that real people talk. The plot thickens as we listen to their conversations. Although some people will probably disagree about who the murderer is, the victim is killed (and I'm pretty sure who ""done"" it), but it's left to the imagination who attempts, and why, to kill him after he is already dead. There are at least four, and perhaps more, persons who make excellent suspects. I like this movie so much that I watch it at least once a week. One of the things I love about it is Jeremy Northam's stylish singing. The songs are sooooo Noel Cowardish: romantic and filled with pathos or nonsensical and funny.",1112140800,,1056,4.652406417112299
1674303,4,B00005V7CT,"This story from the onset seems to become an old-fashioned English murder mystery. The guests arrive at an English country house for some hunting. The man of the house is the benefactor of most of the family and they rely on his money for survival. Allowance is what they live on. Some want to invest, but it's always he who has the last word. This of course leads to some friction.

It's also about two different groups living in one house: the nobles and the below-stairs servants, but they have ties in more that just the servants way.

The most interesting characters are two Americans. The vegetarian (and gay?) movie producer played by Bob Balaban and his help/actor played by Ryan Phillippe, who starts out as his servant by playing a scottish guy.

The patriarch gets killed without us really knowing who did it. Then Stephen Fry enters the movie and we suspect he will solve the mystery, but he doesn't really...

It's a movie that is more interesting then at first seems, there are some subtle differences with other movies. The acting is superb, somehow playing a servant or a stiff upper lip English noble are roles that everyone revels in.

I was intrigued but left with a strange feeling of not exactly knowing what I just saw or what had happened. Think I'm going to have to see it again...",1111881600,,1305,4.607758620689655
1674304,3,B00005V7CT,"This appears to be a ""love it or hate it"" film, so I feel odd to be right in the middle here.  While some reviewers seem to have expected a murder mystery, I approached this film with no expectations whatsoever beyond its reputation as a critically acclaimed film.  What I got was a mostly well-executed Robert Altman film, with all his idiosyncracies, and what I ended up with was too much of a good thing.  As for the mystery, the film is over halfway complete before it happens, as there's too much setup and character development; this is generally a good thing but only if the characters are really interesting.  Altman's most memorable work (""M*A*S*H,"" ""Nashville,"" ""Popeye,"" and even ""The Player"") has far more interesting and well-defined characters than ""Gosford Park,"" which is a serious flaw.

It's another huge ensemble cast piece, my favorite performance (easily) being that of grand old Dame Maggie Smith, looking every one of her 66 years and then some.  God bless her for not having tons of ""work done,"" unlike so many plastic-faced plastic people in showbiz.  A well-deserved Oscar nomination for best supporting actress for Madame Smith, as well as for Helen Mirren.  As is typical of Altman's work, this huge cast mingles and interacts well, hard to see which bits are ad libs and which are plot points because they all tend to build in the direction needed to carry the story; some lovely and memorable moments, such as the maids dancing outside the party to the music being played inside for the upper crust.

For all of Altman's style and well-deserved reputation, I had a hard time sticking out this overly long drama.  For one thing, I'm mystified that the word ""comedy"" is attached to this film in any respect; I found no humor other than the idiot police inspector, the most moronic such character since Clouseau; while Peter Sellers was funny, however, here the character is just a nuisance, a one-line joke gone on too long.  It's also a problem with all Altman films that his method makes the dialogue very, very hard to follow, and often hard to even hear; sure, I'm all for the realism of overlapping dialogue, but the helter-skelter method of hiding mikes and cameras to catch actors ad libbing, in order to splice together a story later, results in too much off-mike echo of voices, rustling of costumes, etc., hard to hear what's going on.  I always feel like I'm missing something when watching an Altman film, and that's irritating because his films are generally interesting; this one certainly is.

Credit where credit is due; the story takes some unexpected turns and has a pip of an ending.  I just would've liked to have a program so I could tell the players one from the other, and a transcript in the other hand to see what was being said much of the time.  I think I have better ways to spend future 2-1/2 hour chunks of my life.",1110844800,4,2873,4.695219123505976
1674305,5,B00005V7CT,"Within the movie world it is pretty much taken as a given, and has been for years, that Robert Altman isn't for all tastes.  Yet even with that in mind, when reading over many of the one star reviews here, it is difficult to know whether I should laugh or shake my head in dismay.

As the movie viewing public, or more sadly should I say, the American viewing public reached such a vapid, vacuous, and unsophisticated level of taste that any movie which isn't full of car chases, explosions, or in which the immediate plot has not unfolded three minutes after the opening credits have been completed and everything has not been wrapped up in 95 minutes?  Given the box office take of tripe like ""Are We There Yet,"" and ""Bogeyman"" I strongly suspect that the answer is a sad and resounding ""YES.""

If you can't be bothered with such inconveniences as character development, nuance in plot, and a sense that there is much more going on in the story that is unfolding on the screen than there is a good chance that ""Gosford Park,"" is not for you.  If these things don't scare you and you are willing to open yourself up to the notion that this isn't simply a straight forward murder mystery devoid of social commentary you might want to give it a chance.  If you relish movies in which subtlety, sharp writing and a story that works on more than one level (and simplistic one at that) than what are you waiting for.

And lastly, for those of you who can't write a one star review for this exceptional movie without using the words ""boring,"" ""dull,"" etc. I have good news for you.

This is perhaps the stupidest, most pretentious, most godawful piece of rubbish every vomited out by director Robert Altman, who once upon a time could work a camera (when you need to pay rent, you better be good), but now realizes that his white, middle-class liberal audience would happily eat a turd if he offered it to them on a silver platter, handsomely mounted.

Altman makes a point of criticizing George W. Bush. But at least, in the field he's in, Bush delivers to his audience. Altman throws talented actors like Kristin Scott Thomas, Maggie Smith, and Michael Gambon---and a lotta gorgeous English scenery, including a stately manor home, all of whom/which deserve better---into a cinematic blender, and his ""puree"".

1674309,5,B00005V7CT,"Altman has made a film which appeals on at least two quite different levels.  For those who enjoy sophisticated social comedy with a nice mystery plot--folks who enjoy Agatha Christie--this is a winner.  The film can certainly entertain one on these grounds alone.  It is sumptuous and beautiful to look at, and the characters are complicated in some cases, and hold one's interest even when they are ""types"" because of the acidulous dialogue.

  However, more challengingly, there is certainly a historical-social context which Altman has more than suggested.  The only historical character is Ivor Novello, who was a gay actor-songwriter of the 20s and 30s, and it is significant that he brings a fictional gay film director, jewish and gay, to the party.  These socially marginal characters, who are tolerated by the gentile aristocrats, are the moral center of the film.  They--that is, --and the servants downstairs, whose life is a wretched inverted mirror-image of the hideous stratified social ziggurat we find upstairs.

  Consider that Altman gives a precise date for the action:  November, 1934.  The Nazis had just won their first big election in Germany, and the British Union of Fascists, under Sir Oswald Moseley had just pulled off their first big rally in London.  Hmmm.  Could the temporal setting be merely accidental?",1102377600,2,1337,5.177570093457944

1674311,3,B00005V7CT,"Calling this movie a murder mystery violates the Trades Description Act. Even calling it an ""Agatha Christie Country House Murder"" is misinformation because none of Christie's detectives are involved, and it's frankly not in her style. When you first read a Christie story, you don't know who did it until the last chapter. There is no mystery about this murder. The only conflict about it is ""Will the people in the house at last catch on?"" and ""Will they tell?""

So, don't buy it if you are expecting thrills and chills.

This is really ""Upstairs / Downstairs"", set in 1932, [twenty to thirty years from the days of Mr. Hudson, Rose and Mrs. Bridges]  Nothing has greatly changed on both levels, except that this upper class are on a higher social strata than the Bellamys. Country house folk, instead of urban political folk.

The 'upstairs' folks are stock characters. Dame Agatha and P.G. Wodehouse used their types often; but both authors would have made them less 'boring'. There is the rich industrial tycoon, Sir William McQuorkidale (or something like that) who now lives the life of a country gentleman, and his relatives-in-law, who feed off his wealth because a)they can't run a successful business or don't know how to work or b) were brought up to think work is beneath their class.  The only persons who do work are Ivor Novello (a real-life entertainer; but Sir William's fictional cousin) and his American producer friend. There are two female upstairs characters I pity: Sir William's daughter Isabel (the poor-rich kid who's being blackmailed) and Mabel, the wife of a twit who squandered her money and now despises her middle-class manners. Mabel is well acted, and she shows more spirit at the end of the film.

  The interesting, believable people are the servants. The film shows their attitudes to their jobs, to each other, and to their employers. Very little subservience there. Several major British actors playing those roles. The added 'perks' on the DVD about the authenticity and the commentary by the writer, whose family was upper-class, are worth watching to understand how this film is not a mystery at all but a sort of fictional 'day-in-the-life' of a stately home between the wars.  (Fans of the BBC documentary 'The Victorian Kitchen' will enjoy it because Ruth Mott was the technical advisor for the kitchen staff)

  I thought it was cheeky to cast Stephen Fry as the bumbling inspector. This is the same time period as P.G. Wodehouse's 'Jeeves & Wooster' tales. Fry, dressed in 'thirties garments, looked enough like Jeeves masquerading as a Scotland Yard Inspector to make me think Hugh Laurie should appear as Bertie Wooster. The film producer, the pompous dignified butler, the foolish drone Lord Something or other [if not his leach of a friend] seemed send-ups of Wodehouse's comic characters.

There are some very witty put-downs sprinkled through the film. Jeremy Northam's Ivor Novello is a treat to listen to - but not for long periods, as Maggie Smith's character points out. Some of the more interesting characters' scattered subplots would have been interesting. (Will Elsie end up in Hollywood or in the gutter? Will Mabel divorce Freddie now that she's stood up to him? Will Mary become 'the perfect servant' or will she leave the countess?) The set designs and lighting are worth appreciation if you are a film student. Also the contrast between the lanquid movements of the upstairs people with the haste and almost constant scrubbing downstairs.  I appreciated the women's clothes. How 1930's upper class women looked so elegant during the Great Depression is a study in itself.

  People who watch History Television / The History Channel will appreciate this film's period details; but there's no plot, no mystery, nothing to hold your attention. I was bored when I watched in in the theatre; but it is more interesting now that I have heard the commentaries.",1095120000,5,3921,4.970948012232416
1674312,3,B00005V7CT,"""Gosford Park"" tries to be two kinds of movie at once. The insights into the servants and the upper-class relationships is startling for fans of ""Masterpiece Theatre,"" but the storyline is bogged down by the tepid murder mystery, and the film putters to an unsatisfying end.

At an old British country house in the 1930s, guests are arriving through the rain for a shooting party. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) is an unscrupulous noveau riche aristocrat, and he presides over a household that contains many servants: butler, housekeeper, footmen, maids, and many more. Like good early-20th-century servants, they know their place in the strict hierarchy.

But things come unravelled as the guests arrive: acid tongued Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith) and her naive maid Mary (Kelly MacDonald), and her sisters and brothers-in-law. Adding a bit of American flavor is actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam) and producer Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban). But then McCordle is poisoned and stabbed, and a thick, sticky web of old lies, seduction and malice is uncovered.

If nothing else, ""Gosford Park"" is soothing to watch. We get a great view of the trappings of the 1930s British upper-crust. Altman also lingers on little things like putting on jewelry, driving an old car or setting a table, which gives a pleasant feel to the slow-paced plot. The murder scene is one of the few shocking, fast-paced parts of the whole movie.

As a mystery, it's a dismal failure -- it meanders along, providing lots of red herrings, and the surprise finale is an abrupt, epic anticlimax. The biggest mystery is who Ryan Phillipe is. As a period piece and class commentary, it's surprisingly effective -- we not only get to see the ""downstairs"" people, but we get a glimpse of how they were used and ignored by the people they worked for, and how snobbery can seep into any social class.

Altman also injects a little subtle comedy, such as the inept detective (wonderfully played by Stephen Fry) who ignores everyone of the lower classes. Despite this, you're left to judge the characters by themselves. And he manages to keep things interesting in otherwise boring scenes, by using some elaborate camerawork, slowly rotating as the characters talk about class and position.

Maggie Smith is the scene-stealer here, as a barb-tongued old lady who doesn't hold back on anybody. Ryan Phillipe is completely stone-faced, but he seems to be doing so deliberately. Michael Gambon blusters his way through a dull role, but Helen Mirren is outstanding as the housekeeper, and Kelly Macdonald gives off an air of corrupted innocence as Mary.

""Gosford Park"" is marred by a dreadful mystery story, but the class commentary and sets are deeply striking. Flawed but still worth watching, for fans of isolated-house murder mysteries.",1093132800,,2812,5.073593073593074
1674313,5,B00005V7CT,"As a mystery, the movie stinks. The murder is pedestrian. The clues are obvious. The denoement is anti-climatic. However, the movie is about the characters and is a period piece. The movie introduces dozens of characters: both servants and their masters. Amazingly, Altman gets you interested in most of the characters. The movie goes between the upstairs people and the downstairs people and how their lives are separate on the surface, but are deeply intertwined. It reminds me of ""Rear Window"" a little bit, where the murder is really only a device to introduce the various plot lines.

Altman indicates in the director's commentary it was meant to be seen several times. He also introduces profanity to move it into a ""R"" rating. The profanity wasn't obtrusive. I hear more in my work place every day. The goal of the R rating is that he didn't want teenagers seeing it; this movie isn't meant for them. The movie expects the viewer to be observant and to not pick up everything the first time. There is an emotional and a psychological depth to the film.

There is beauty in the details of the film. The sets are spectacular. The wardrobe is amazing. Even the lighting is interesting. Everything is researched: how the servants set the table, how the boots are shined, and how the class system among the servant ranks is almost more rigid than their masters'.

The movie is fun and makes me smile. The director's commentary in the DVD starts off slow, but slowly delivers interesting details. In this day of endless cop movies with silly car chases and explosions, this movie entertains.",1092787200,10,1592,4.802919708029197
1674314,3,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman's GOSFORD PARK was a critics' darling when it was released and even copped an Oscar for Julian Fellowes' screenplay.  I found the whole product rather trifling and dull, myself.  When the murder finally happens (well over an hour into the movie), it's so quick and unexciting, it's meaningless.  Meanwhile the overrated Altman lets his excellent cast wander around the estate, speaking in such thick accents, much of their dialogue is undecipherable.  There are so many characters that one needs a scorecard to keep up with who's with who and how they relate to each other.  Altman did do a fine job in capturing the look and feel of 1937 England, and Patrick Doyle's score is affective.  The cast has some marvelous performances, particularly by Maggie Smith as the gossipy down and out countess; Derek Jacobi as one of the faithful valets; Eileen Atkins and Helen Mirren, as sister servants with dark secrets; Alan Bates as the head master of the valets, and Michael Gambon as the doomed head of the household.  Emily Watson, Kristin Scott Thomas and Clive Owen give marginally good performances, no vitality though.  And Ryan Phillipe is very, very uneffective in his role as the masquerading valet.

GOSFORD PARK is a stylish but vacant movie, leaving me wanting more from less characters and subplots.",1091923200,3,1320,4.9908675799086755
1674315,4,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is a fairly rare specimen. The murder-mystery genre is largely defunct, with most efforts being relegated to TV movies, most of those simple rehashes of previous stories. The movie industry has largely ceded the mystery to the TV series, where shows like Monk and Murder, She Wrote present them in flippant hour-long episodes, and the occasional effort of the semi-regular series, such as Columbo, are slowly disappearing as well.

 It's somewhat refreshing to see a period piece as a murder mystery, indeed, and this well-cast film does a commendable job of providing good, solid entertainment. But all of the main players provide more than adequate acting skills, and in the large repertoire of both guests and servants, there's nary an off mark. The dialogue is sharp and focused when it needs to be and demurely sublime otherwise. Kudos especially go to Stephen Fry, playing Inspector Thompson, providing just enough comic relief to pick the movie up just when it seems to drag without turning it into a farce.

 The movie largely plays by the old ""fair play"" rule of the between-wars mystery writers, where it's conceivable that any viewer can unravel the culprit up to the point of disclosure. As pieces of the mystery are slowly revealed, it all congeals, though when the murderer is revealed it's hard to believe anyone would be all that surprised.

 In some ways, this does seem to be a little bit of a waste. Much of the movie builds up an almost unbelievable amount of motive from guests and servants alike, but anyone who's paying close attention knows which ones to discard almost immediately. And, instead of focusing on the bits and pieces of the actual murder-muddy footsteps, broken glasses, the eponymous dog that doesn't bark-it focuses on personalities and motives. This in itself isn't a big deal, and the movie itself pokes fun at itself for just this reason. Alas, the movie also seems to be enjoying itself a bit too much, especially at the end when all of the unresolved issues are closed up in what is supposedly shot-after-shot shocking revelations that are neither shocking nor revelations, but are entertaining anyway.

 The movie is a touch too long-the buildup of motives takes too long, considering that most are easily ignorable anyway-and no one actually gets murdered until around the halfway point. But this is a good, sturdy, entertaining film for anyone who is even remotely interested in the subject matter.",1091836800,,2459,4.980487804878049
1674316,5,B00005V7CT,"The upperclass friends and relations of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) arrive at his country house for a weekend of shooting, accompanied by maids, footmen, and valets, all of whom will be staying under one roof.  Sir William is a mean-spirited and self-centered old man, married to a much younger, emotionally distant wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), with many family members dependent upon his continuing largesse.  The hilariously waspish Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), who believes she has a lifetime stipend, arrives with young Mary Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald), who is trying valiantly to become a good lady's maid.  Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), a Hollywood star, and Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban), a producer of Charlie Chan movies, are the only guests without aristocratic backgrounds and inherited privilege.  The atmosphere of the house, filled with venomous ""friends"" and relations, soon becomes even more poisonous.

The ""below stairs"" lives of the servants are also fully revealed, as they share living quarters, eat meals together, tend to the laundry and cooking, and gossip about their employers.  The butler Jennings (Alan Bates) and the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren) run the household and try to guarantee that no real-world cares will intrude upon the lives of their employers.  Since ""upstairs"" and ""downstairs"" occasionally meet very privately at night, secrets abound, many of them secrets of long standing.  When Sir William is poisoned and stabbed (""Trust Sir William to be murdered twice""), nearly everyone has a motive for wanting him dead.

For director Robert Altman, the primary focus of the film is on the characters, their way of life, and their values, with the murder mystery secondary.  Set in late November, the end of the year 1932,  the action takes place when this secure aristocratic lifestyle is also nearing its end, something that the arrival of the newly rich Hollywood characters, Novello and Weissman, illustrates.  Dramatic cinematography (by Andrew Dunn) emphasizes the cold and rainy dreariness of the weekend, and suggests parallels with the coldness of the dying aristocracy.

Interior shots reveal the contrasts between the elegant and mannered lives of the ""upstairs"" characters and the hardworking daily lives of the ""downstairs"" characters, who adhere to their own rigid social codes.  Every detail seems true, and as the characters' lives and interrelationships are revealed obliquely in brief snippets of seemingly unrelated conversations, a broad picture of the upstairs and downstairs lifestyles gradually emerges.  Fully developed, many-leveled, wonderfully acted, often funny, and impeccably directed and filmed, this is a film one can watch again and again with delight.

1674317,5,B00005V7CT,"Take an 'idea' by Bob Balaban and Robert Altman, transform that idea into a screenplay by Julian Fellowes, place Robert Altman in the director's chair, and gather many of the finest actors in England (and the USA), photograph it with Andrew Dunn as cinematographer, and assign the musical score to Patrick Doyle and presto! - out comes a bubbling movie that entertains on every level and makes a lot of statements about class distinction and other prejudices as well.  GOSFORD PARK is a gem of a film and only grows better with repeated viewings.

Gosford Park is the estate owned by grumpy William McCordle (Michael Gambon) who has a way of distancing most everyone he encounters, his bored wife Sylvia (Kristen Scott Thomas), his frumpy daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford), and served by a staff of servants who include the very in control Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren), the butler Jennings (Alan Bates), and the head of the kitchen Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins).  A weekend hunting party is underway and as the guests arrive the dichotomy between the wealthy and the serving class is emphasized. Among the odd assortment of guests (each with a pack of secrets and prejudices) are Maggie Smith, Tom Hollander, Charles Dance, Bob Balaban, Jeremy Northam, James Wilby, and their valets and servants Clive Owen, Kelly Macdonald, Ryan Phillippe, etc.  The servants are incorporated into the staff rooms by the strange Emily Watson, Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Swift et al. The arrival evening drops a few hints of problems afoot both among the guests and among the servants.  The hunting party is scarred by a minor accident, but the real problem occurs at the dinner following the hunting party - a time when some of the occult problems become more obvious and culminate in the murder of the vile William McCordle.  The police are called and Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry) uncovers some strange evidence that leads to not only the events of the murder but also unveils many of the secrets of both guests and servants.  There is a surprise ending that somehow makes all of the characters seem more human than their artificial roles they have assumed.

This is a banquet of fine acting and ensemble work and adds such treasures as a series of songs performed by Jeremy Northam with great style as well as unexpected cameos by a large number of lesser-known actors.  It is a fine mystery, Altman style, and is as frothy and refreshing as fine champagne!  Grady Harp, April 08",1088812800,34,2461,4.880095923261391
1674318,3,B00005V7CT,"No matter how many actors, including bankable stars, appear in a Robert Altman movie, it seems to be about Altman. He has an individual, if by now familiar, style of filmmaking that is always calling attention to itself. That style includes very fluid camera movement, quick-cut editing, and a good deal of dialogue that is covered by other dialogue or sounds distant. We are meant to be awed by the spontaneity and naturalism of it all.
Apparently many people are impressed by this mannerism and consider it a sign of artistry. On the whole, I find it pretentious and irritating. In one of the supplementary features on the DVD, Altman, his screenwriter and a handful of the actors from Gosford Park are interviewed in front of a studio audience. Altman and the writer rattle on about how every scene is shot by two cameras that are always in motion, so that the actors are never sure whether they are going to be foreground or atmosphere, or what angle they'll be seen from. Does Altman really think he invented the idea of shooting a scene from multiple angles, and choosing one during editing? And why is a camera that's gliding and panning constantly somehow more ""truthful"" than one that's framing the character or group that the director believes is most essential to telling the story at that moment?
It can be said in Altman's favor, though, that he never makes a merely conventional or routine film; they are all a bit eccentric (a compliment in my book) and, despite my reservations about the camera and sound-recording style, usually offer a fresh view of the theme or its environment. Gosford Park is your standard Agatha Christie-style murder mystery set among a dinner-jacketed, evening-gowned crowd in an English manor house in 1932 -- except, in this case, the doings of the upper crust are set against the army of servants below stairs who work their tails off to make everything straight, gleaming and smooth for their social betters.
Altman and his screenwriter Julian Fellows do a very creditable and humane job of conveying the personalities and individuality of the servants; they aren't just symbols of The Oppressed. The characters of the gentry, though, while ably portrayed (the acting talent makes sure of that), are almost universally so sour, rude and calculating that it's hard not to feel that there's a touch of old-fashioned, left-wing agit-prop involved. (The one exception is Jeremy Northam, who plays Ivor Novello -- a real singer and film star of the period -- with considerable charm.) I can believe that an assembly of English bluebloods in that era might have carried within themselves much wickedness, but they would have been far too polished to display it as openly and crudely as they do in Gosford Park.
Altman recruited a clutch of A-list British stage and film actors, and they don't fail him. Altman's casual attitude toward the basics of craftsmanship (as opposed to displaying his self-assumed creative genius) ensures that you will be lucky to figure out who half the characters are and their relationships with one another by the time of the denouement, but their cultivated swinishness holds the attention anyway. I think actors love playing obnoxious and unlikeable characters; these seem to be enjoying their roles, and you will, too.

""the accents are impossible to understand""
Wakey wakey guys, there's a whole English-speaking world outside the USA (including the countries of most of your ancestors), and surprise surprise, we don't all speak exactly as you do! If you have to, watch the film with subtitles!
""the film was dull""
I can just imagine these people looking at a Rembrandt painting and calling it dull because the colours aren't bright enough. Haven't any of you ever heard of subtlety? Understatement? or the big one: IRONY? (not the Alanis Morrissette definition either, it's wrong).
""[it has a] mundane dispassionate story""
Which planet is this person from? How about when Mrs Wilson allows her long-lost son to leave without admitting she knows who he is? If you didn't find that scene charged with emotion then there's really something wrong with you. I recommend that you stick to movies with one-dimensional actors like Tom Cruise - you can tell when his scenes are ""passionate"" and ""dramatic"" because he starts shouting. When Cruise stops shouting, you know the ""passionate"" part is over.
""it is incomprehensible when connecting the characters""
Complex, certainly - hence the irony when the Detective says ""We just want people with some connection to the dead man"" as he dismisses a group including the deceased's mistresses and unacknowledged son. For you, I recommend ""Anti-Trust"", one of the worst movies I've ever seen, in which the entire plot is not only predictable, but explained repeatedly anyway with flashbacks to important scenes etc. Interestingly, that appalling piece of work also includes Ryan Phillippe, though in a much less appropriate role. It was sheer genius in Gosford Park to cast an unconvincing American actor as an unconvincing American actor.
""this is supposed to be a murder mystery""

That is not what this is. Beneath the tip of that iceberg of the rich and titled, roars a mighty engine of people working hard, getting little respect, and having lives of equal value, overlooked oppressed, but creators of all there is in this world
  My grandmother's friends from church were all women who sometime in their lives had been servants, whether they had become social workers, teachers, or house wives.  Inevitably, when they would come over after church, a discussion of ""their people"" they had worked for as servants would break out. It was always the same thing, of the incapacity of people used to paying people to do things to achieve simple tasks, look at things from common sense, and despite their self-images as beneficent employers how ""their people"" constantly overloaded them with tasks beyond their job, and had absolutely no concern or knowledge of their needs to take time off for personal or health reasons.  Sneaking and listening to them, I heard many rather dramatic things about movers and shakers in our town and the national from these old women.
  Not much changes. About 15 years ago, a friend who had been a writer and editor for years moved to California. Through an old high school friend, he landed a job working in the home of a very prominent movie star, a job that was supposed to get him set up financially and a job that would end up getting him in touch with people in the movies and the papers that could land him a job or provide contact for his own writing.  When, I went to visit him, he had the same kinds of stories and stupidities to tell that those ladies who were friends of my grandmother told. Moreover, no one would bother to talk to him about his writing and editing, because none of the people he would want to know about his work because none of them noticed him because he was a servant.
  In a superbly acted movie, with great roles for everyone, we see how this world operates. Altman's brilliance here is that all this is done in a human, compelling, often funny, sometimes gripping manner.
  On the DVD you will listen to the writer of the film explain how each thing you think may be a wild exaggeration, or some weird exception in the behavior of the upper classes was something he himself saw or heard friends and relatives say or do.
  Of course,  it is not just the servants in the big houses, but all the working people all around the world whose work is hidden, who needs are abused, who provide the basis for everything and get no recognition.

In reply to the previous reviewers, this film is not primarily a detective film, so one shouldn't expect this to be like your classic whodunnit. In fact the murder and it's resolution seem almost secondary. What is the more interesting aspect of the film is it's depiction of the interraction between the English aristocracy and their servants.
It is a comedy of sorts as well. You have the dimwitted pipesmoking, Sherlock-Holmes imitating detective who fails to discover any relevant information on the murder, you have your typical American who is constantly on the phone about urgent business and then you have the pretentious 'sods' themselves; the aristocracy.
There are a number of subplots within the film, all of which are skillfully tied in toward the end. There aren't many dull moments in this movie as there is always something to be resolved, and so many characters to keep track off.

1674323,5,B00005V7CT,"What I like about this film is its class. It's so brilliantly directed that the flow of the story is never interrupted. It's balanced, it's witty, it's full of mystery and fun. And it never strays to the realm of the over-the-top murder tales that are full of larger-than-life characters and Clue-esque easy answers. And although very unique in many ways, it does have a somewhat basic storyline (which causes its originality to be much more impressive).
A hierarchy of British nobility is visiting a couple in their mansion (and their servants are joining them during the ""vacation""). The husband of the hosting couple is a vile man with many secrets that too many of the servants know about (like his many sexual adventures with factory women, who would birth children he could care less about). These events from the past start to seep in and stir up in both the upstairs and downstairs of the old mansion and the murder mystery begins, without a prime suspect.
The emotional undertone of the ""evil man,"" as we'll call him, and the relationship he has with a certain servant allows the film to be much more than a well-directed, well-written mystery. It's socially conscious and it will have you caring about each and every character in a certain way, which may cause some to have favorites (the cast is large enough to do so). I have not seen a film in recent memory that is so successful at pulling you in and getting you involved with the importance of the story as well as its plot. And this immensely advantageous quality is not only because of Robert Altman's direction, interweaving the various plot lines and characters seamlessly. It is also because of the screenplay.
The writing, by Julian Fellows, is intelligent, clever and sometimes down-right funny! It allowed for scenes with many people talking at once to have key moments that you could absorb without the least bit of trouble. You'll know when you need to listen in, and you'll know when a line is meant to be comic relief, or something of that sort. Fellows deserved the Oscar (2001, for best Original Screenplay) completely.
Don't forget the actors. The cast is a sprawling who's who of British (and two American) actors. It includes young soon-to-be-thespians such as Ryan Phillipe and Kelly McDonald, and another rising star: Clive Owen. But the film belongs to three women: Maggie Smith, Emily Watson, and, especially, Helen Mirren. All three never cease adding on layers to their characters, one of which could have suffered from being a cardboard cut-out of a person. Smith is hilarious, Watson does some great internal work, and so does Mirren, who has a killer scene toward the end of the film that will have you sobbing. All three were, in a word, amazing.
Some may say the film stretches along to the point of causing boredom. But you must understand that most of the film is key to the ending, and you'll be sitting there during the credits proud of yourself for catching on. It's just that involving! And that may be the movie's only real flaw: it is too subtle for certain people to ""get."" Otherwise, the movie is brilliant, dare I say close to perfect? I do dare. It's just that well-made.",1081814400,2,3176,4.74502712477396
1674324,4,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is good fun and worth seeing, but, like most of Robert Altman's movies, you have to take the good with the bad. The whodunit can be solved before the murder ever occurs (ask yourself why actors of such high magnitude are playing such lowly characters); the story is more clever than wry, more cynical than comical; the convoluted plot cursed with quite a few irrelevant characters; and there's an overwhelming air of self-importance to the thing. I likened the Weissman character to Altman himself - the American auteur who decides, for a kick, to dabble in the world of ineffectual British aristocrats.
But you can't go wrong with such a stellar cast, all of whom are obviously having a hell of a good time making the film. And the quick jumps and cuts between ""upstairs"" (the guests) and ""downstairs"" (the servants) certainly keep the viewer's attention. I didn't even mind the accents, which can be a problem in British films - I didn't understand some of the dialogue, but it's clear from the direction that they aren't saying anything useful anyway! The film does well to take such a huge cast and create notable, memorable characters without spinning wildly out of control, thanks to Altman's skill and the Julian Fellows' taut, sharp screenplay. It's a vast film that takes place in the confines of a very small space.",1081641600,,1338,4.821739130434783

No. I call it a ""sleeper"" because when I saw it in the theater, I had a most delicious little two hour nap. Had this movie been even remotely interesting or entertaining, I would never had got such a deep and relaxing sleep that evening.
To call this movie anything more than just ""dull"" is giving it too much credit for being anything less than the mudane dispassionate story about nothing that it is. I mean this film not only fails to hit any high peaks; it fails to even make the viewer raise an eyebrow every now and again. I've rarely watched a movie with such a deadpan plot.
""Gosford Park"" doesn't stink - that's too extreme for this boring movie. I wish it stunk. Had it been as bad as some of Russ Meyer's crazy B films, I might have actually stayed awake and been entertained somewhat. At least I would have got a good laugh.

1674326,5,B00005V7CT,"because you miss most of the film the first time around!
On the surface this appears to be a very formulistic murder mystery.  It has the classic setting, 1930's period, an isolated English manor house filled with guests for a weekend shooting party, and all of the servants both resident and visiting.  Everybody has secrets, the tension is so thick it could be cut with a knife and there is conveniently one missing from the kitchen.  For more than half the film we see motives offered and wait for the murder and yet after it occurs it becomes evident that this is NOT a murder mystery at all!
The film has been compared to Upstairs Downstairs and it does involve the lives of those both above and below stairs, but it is much more than that.  The various stories are added layer by layer some, such as the imposter in the servants' hall are obvious while others like the secret abortion are only alluded in a couple of lines.  The various stories are, while interesting, not really the point of the film either.  This is a beautifully drawn portrait of a way of life that is long gone and will probably never return.  Almost everyone has read about or seen depictions of English Country Life in the '20's and '30's. It is a setting that has been used in drama, comedy, romance and of course mystery genres for years but Gosford Park makes it clear that we have only the faintest ideas of what that life was really like.  The genius of this film is that it takes all the information that could have been spread out in a PBS documentary series and used fiction to illustrate the same points in a much more effective and enjoyable way.
The cast is huge and filled with actors, both well known and soon to be well known.  No one is given such a large role that it becomes their film and yet each performer manages to turn their scenes into a polished little gem.
The extras included in the DVD are wonderful.  They include deleted scenes (with commentary), features on the making of, and authenticity of the movies as well as Q & A with cast and filmakers.  The best of the extras by far are the commentaries with the director, Robert Altman and screenwriter, Julian Oscar.
I highly recommend the purchase (as opposed to the renting) of this film.  It is so packed with detail that it would be impossible to absorb it all in just one or two viewings.",1074384000,19,2350,4.452214452214452
1674327,5,B00005V7CT,"While taking all those guided tours through cavernous estate houses in England and Ireland (and even a few on the north shore of Long Island), I always wondered what it was like to live that lifestyle. But of course, walking around those still houses doesn't really tell you about the people who lived there anymore than a stage tells you about its actors. However, Gosford Park was a great way to fill in those blanks. The way it pulls you into the world of 1930's English high society and all its pretense and hypocrisy is great. This movie definitely enlivened my understanding of class in old European societies.
The reason Gosford Park has such great insight is the film's screenwriter, Julian Fellows who himself grew up as part of the English aristocracy. Much of what makes this film fun is the idiosyncrasies of its characters and their world that Fellows has personal experience with. A maid and driver stand in the pouring rain until their mistress gets in the car. Servants only refer to each other by their master's name, and they maintain the same hierarchy as their masters so that a duke's servant is treated better by other servants than a baron's. Only married women are allowed to have breakfast in bed; unmarried women must go to the dining room. What a strange world they lived in, especially to someone like me who grew up in a middle class New York neighborhood.
The spine of Gosford Park is, without question, NOT the murder mystery. In fact, the murder mystery plot is about 5% of the movie-if that. It's what's known in film lingo as a McGuffin, a device that helps propel the plot in a story but is of little importance in itself. If a viewer turns to the murder mystery plot for what this movie is all about, they will most likely be sorely disappointed, seemingly like many of the negative reviewers here were.
The key to enjoying this movie is to think about what it's like to live in a society that is extremely oriented by class. What must it take to keep it going? As I alluded earlier, pretense and hypocrisy grease the gears of high society. From scene to scene, we peep around corners and into bedrooms to see characters trying to hide one secret or another. And in the end, we see the unpleasant consequences of this duplicity.
This is definitely not a film that lays out its purpose before the audience. Since the almost 60 characters (for a chuckle, look under product details above for the colossal cast list) each add something unique to the larger picture, and since the audience is usually only told something once, you definitely have to be your own detective. However, Julian Fellows does a brilliant job interweaving these characters into a solid whole, and he definitely deserves the Oscar he received for the screenplay.
Since this is a complex and subtle film, multiple viewings are helpful, but unlike some other reviewers, this is something I really enjoyed. Like a good album, each time with it reveals another layer and increases your appreciation. Robert Altman, the director, says in his DVD commentary (which was boring except for a few insights, but Julian Fellow's commentary was excellent) that the film is ""like looking in through the windows of a house, you only get part of the picture at a time."" I think this analogy fits nicely, especially since the film is set in a house. Altman also acknowledges what some of the negative reviewers complain about, saying he meant the audience to be left wondering after the first viewing. He didn't intend this movie for the ""wham, bam, thank you ma'am"" set. In fact, Altman went out of his way to insert curse words, guaranteeing an R rating so that ""14 year old boys couldn't walk off the street and watch it.""
And of course, last but not least, the acting was great. Gosford Park has an excellent ensemble cast with not a single weak link. Maggie Smith as the snobbish Aunt makes you smile; Kelly MacDonald as the Aunt's young, innocent maid makes you want to give her a big wet kiss (maybe that's just me); and Clive Owen's cool restraint as a mysterious footman keeps you following him around the screen.
All through, Gosford Park is a movie very well done.",1074124800,,4164,4.674386920980926
1674328,5,B00005V7CT,"GOSFORD PARK was a nice surprise. The movie was purchased as a gift for my husband and I and we had no expectations because we didn't know what the film was about. It is a British film, and although we recognized the faces of a lot of the actors, we were glad to have the opportunity to learn their names. The acting was superb!
The story takes place in the 1930's at a country estate in England called Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle invites a large group of guests to a weekend hunting party.  The movie begins with Constance  (Maggie Smith) leaving her estate to travel to the event along with her driver and maid.  We're treated to wonderful scenes as the guests arrive with their own assemblage of various servants. The often-snobbish guests are assigned rooms and at the same time their servants are in the kitchen receiving their own room assignments. The interesting part is to see that the pecking order for the Earl's guests is not that different from that among the various servants.
The camera scans the room while people are talking and it's difficult to hear most of the comments. I guess the director was giving us the feeling of being in any large place where dozens of people are making small talk. Constance is very snobbish and we get to clearly hear her views about the other guests. When a murder takes place, a bumbling detective is brought in to solve the crime. He doesn't have a clue, but several other people are able to surmise what happened. Everyone has his or her own individual stories and that's really what makes this big film work.  I found myself more interested in what was going on with the servants than I was with their wealthy counterparts.
 I especially enjoyed the acting of Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Derek Jacobi and Maggie Smith.  Jeremy Northam as a Hollywood star gives an excellent performance and also demonstrated a great singing voice.",1073779200,3,1888,4.654654654654655
1674329,2,B00005V7CT,"It's always nice to see a book or DVD hotly contested in its praise or in its criticism. Those who enjoyed it call it ""beautiful"" and ""artistic."" Those who did not enjoy it call it ""boring"" and ""tedious."" And the reviews of those of the latter group, regardless of how well they are written, seem to fall under the sword of the former with 5 out of 19's and 1 out of 13's in the ""did this review help you?""
This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. And the giveaway, if you will, that those who ""loved"" it feel the haunting presence that the naysayers 'might be right,'is that there are any number of ""loved it"" reviews who acknowledge that they had to see it twice.
Golly. I don't want to see a movie twice. I don't want to read a book twice. Perhaps I am in a minority but I think that the quid pro quo of my paying money to the investors of the effort by seeing it or reading it is that I ought to be able to 'get it' the first time.
In Hollywood (I don't know, I have to imagine) we make excellent, powerful movies that (a) are palatable to the public (art); and (b) make money for the investors. These movies are American movies.
At the risk of sounding xenophobic, what we don't do well is make French movies. Or Swedish movies. Or movies about Danish teenagers. And we don't make movies about the British class system very well at all.
Everything about the movie is true. Maggie Smith is a delight. The photogrophy is lush. The music is enthralling.
Regretably, the other things are true as well. If we had to wait any longer for Michael Gambon to die, the poor bloke would have died of old age. The dialogue, when it can be understood, doesn't carry any meaning. It doesn't make sense. Literally, who cares? This is a murder mystery. Purportedly, Michael did a naughty and he's going to pay for it. Let's off the bugger and be on with it.

Upon a more careful watching, it is in my top five.  The key is how this movie, while looking like a conventional drawing room mystery, BREAKS all the conventions in a masterful way.  The most significant motif is the focus on details through the perspective of the servants, and not the snobby leeches who are dependent on the murder victim in various ways.  The music is wonderful; the Ivor Novella tunes alone are worth the experience.",1072828800,,573,4.69
1674331,4,B00005V7CT,"The first time I watched Gosford Park, I was a little bored, and a little stressed out. It was difficult to catch what everyone was saying, and I could not keep track of who was who! When it was done I was relieved, and wondered why it had won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in the first place. I slept on it, and the next day I decided to give it a second chance--and am I glad I did! I pretty much knew the names of all the characters and such so I could focus on the story and also the great dialogue. It reminded me of the old classic movies that were made up primarily of really good dialogue.
The movie also had a really good idea about the upper crusts and their servants (who know more than their employers would like!). One line in the film says it all: one of the detectives who is interviewing all the people in the house after the murder, sees no point in speaking to many of the servants. He only wants to investigate the people, he says, ""had a real connection to the victim."" Oh, contraire!
There is a wickedly good twist at the end (though I kind of suspected it earlier on), and it just cements the statement the film makers were trying to say.
I highly recommend Gosford Park, and even if you enjoy it the first time around, watch it again, maybe even more than that, to be sure you catch every bit of brilliant dialogue.",1069286400,4,1347,4.204633204633205
1674332,4,B00005V7CT,"It's tough to fault the hordes of viewers who found this movie dreadfully unbearable, ""a waste of time"", ""utter tripe"" etc. I couldn't tell a footboy from a butler or a valet myself, but I could surely feel that this was one long movie!
But that doesn't mean it is not a deliciously watchable feast of film making.
Setting: a bunch of woefully uppetty folks meet up at a humongous country house in Britain for a week of shooting pigeons (one of those affluent pursuits.) Each rich soul has a dedicated, personal servant to be pandered by. And the movie's various funny moments derive from this now-comical-but-then-a-reality setting.
The narrative is Altman-fabulous and lined with a liberal dose of wry humour:
  - ""So you think he's the murderer?""
  - ""No, even worse. He's an actor.""
...and a fair amount of cultural barbs:
  - ""Stop snivelling, they'll think you're Italian!"", or,
  - ""You Brits don't have a sense of humour, do you?"" and the ever so politely delivered retort, ""We do, when something is funny, Sir.""
After only the hour and 10 minutes of introductions to the various characters, when we do hit the crime, the turtle pace quickens a notch. I can see why this long pregnant wait leaves some viewers wraught. But personally I found this Agatha Christie-esque unravelling of each individual's idiosynchrasies fascinating, because it sets up a ""motive"" for several of our characters. It's twice as much fun if many people COULD have executed the murder.
Enter: Stephen Fry as a very Sherlock Holmes-esque investigator, pipe and trenchcoat and all. Kind of builds up hope for a thrilling investigation, doesn't it. Trouble is, none is forthcoming. Fry made do with a small-fry part really.
No, the murder is instead solved in a somewhat lame manner, by one of the inquisitive maids. This is the biggest gyp of the film and the reason I take off the 1 full delicious star. I could see the ending coming from a mile.
Overall a stylishly told story, with some very good moments. I found the subtitles very handy as the Scottish accents, and the occasional argot, are a bit tough to comprehend.
Don't really set yourself up for a murder mystery who-dun-it, which it could be argued it is, in a half-baked sort of a way, but that is probably a plus: this is not your run of the mill murder mystery but an off-beat movie that'll nonetheless hold your attention.",1069027200,,2370,4.749391727493918

For a start, the murder doesn't take place until more than halfway through the film, the detective when he appears is an idiot who couldn't detect his way out of a paper bag, and it's pretty obvious from the start who the murderer is, and why she did it.  Pathetic.  The film is riddled with cliches, all the upper-class characters are grim and repressed, all the working-class characters are warm, vibrant, life-loving etc.  The film is just about worth watching for the performance of Maggie Smith, playing the only interesting character in the film, and the lovely Ivor Novello music.

This is because when i first bought this movie I almost thought about selling it back used.  It was only after a certain amount of determination on my part that I was able to come to enjoy this film.
  Yet this movie deserves to be viewed multiple times.  The way the dialogue is done, and the confusion created by all the sub-plots proves to be frustrating initially.  With each viewing however I found that once I knew the basics of the plot, I was able to grasp a lot more, and to enjoy the film.  Every time I watch it now I notice new things, various details that Robert Altman slipped into the film that did not seem to stand out before.
  It should be said, that (at least from what I remember) in one of the documentaries in the extra features, Robert Altman states that he didn't want to keep the murder a mystery.  This is Altman playing around with the conventional who-dunnit.  one.  These extra features add a further dimension of appreciation for me, over the meticulous detail put into the creation of the setting, and its authenticity.

1674335,5,B00005V7CT,"Although this film has a murder in it, it is really not a murder mystery.  The murder simply serves as a maypole around which the large cast of characters and the many subplots weave in and out.  For me it was a fascinating portrayal of the British class system, extending as it does from the Aristocrats (and Wannabees) to the servants that wait upon them.  The chief complaint among the reviews that I read was that it was hard to hear.  Those hushed tone are purposeful.  Since everyone at the country estate, Gosford Park, has a secret agenda he or she is pursuing (money,illicit sex, a past to keep hidden), the characters must often speak to each other in hushed tones. What reveals their secret agendas often comes out in the sly and subtle non-verbal communications they carry on with each other. That it takes a while to catch on to each character and subplot is  also purposeful.  It's as if each of us (the viewers) is a first-time guest for this weekend ""shoot"" of birds and it takes us a while to catch on to the overtones and undertones of these people who are congregated under one roof.  I found it a remarkable and fascinating experience, as if I am catching glimpses of life in a country estate through a periscope and having to connect the dots from one scene to another.  I was willing to see it over and over (six times so far) to  catch every nuance and subplot.  The acting is undeniably superb.",1067040000,,1418,4.478599221789883

The story gets more interesting when the Weisman character announces he's making a murder mystery movie based on such a social occasion in the UK.  Of course then someone does get murdered.

What follows is vigorous interviews by a bumbling constable and his competent sidekick, and endless endless, mindless scenes with coarse crude servants, and rich snobbish nobility. Is this supposed to be a plot? I don't think so.
While I was prepared to like Gosford Park, I found the plot way too meandering for my taste. The protagonist, Mary, is ill-defined, and the rest of the cast just seem to show up at odd points throughout the story with no apparent reason or motive, or reason.
Even the killer, seemed to lack sufficient motive to do the deed. By the end of this film I admit I found myself counting the seconds until it ended. Gratuitous sex scenes were added to produce the ""R"" rating which could quite easily have been edited out, and had no bearing on the story. Overall...I consider Gosford Park to be frustrating.

Oh yes, the movie starts with a good atmosphere. Rainy England, large mansion, Rolls Royce, Maggie Smith...all very impressive. But alas, there were other scenes in the movie as well!
A seemingly good start is hardly enough to make you sit through this long torcher.
Why a torcher you ask? Well, there are several reasons.
Too many characters- which of the 643 did it?!?!?!? The film is too long and very, very slow. Nothing really happens. Some may protest saying, 'the plot develops- the relationships are revealed', well, then, the whole thing is done in an extremely uninteresting way. If it weren't for the marvellous thing called 'will power', one would easily have used 'Gosford Park' as a good ecuse for a short sleep.
The characters, so many of them, are not introduced well. One can hardly familiarise with the names and the corresponding faces. This, too, stems from having too many characters.
All this apart, the film did have one good aspect- that of Maggie Smith. Constance (her character) will make you laugh. Her proud humour and wit are entertaining.

It is extremely difficult to memorize all the characters-- I watched the movie twice and I'm not sure if I have half the characters names right.
But despite the confounding dizziness of it all-- I was in love with the movie. As Director Altman states, it is not a ""whodunit"" sort of movie-- no no no. The point of the story was to create a murder mystery, in which everything is seen by the servants' POV. This is a wonderful technique, and it is executed fabulously. The servants' are not drab, and similar. Like real people, they all have different personalities. And as expected, everyone is not who they seem.

A murder mystery set in the early 1930's in a mansion in England, more than a dozen main characters (and a number of other supporting ones) flit by you in the first few minutes. Even for the most die-hard movie viewer, there is a lot to keep track of throughout the movie.
First and foremost, the plot: a group of well-born (and some not so well-born) Englishmen and women gather with their servants for a weekend house party. Of course, the inevitable murder takes place and the inevitable investigation ensues. However, the murder is in many ways the least interesting thing about this movie. The movie really focuses on the English class structure and the clean break between those ""upstairs"" and those ""downstairs."" Emily Watson and Helen Mirren will break your heart as two of the more poignant members of the downstairs. As for the upstairs-ah, well, that's really where the murder is taking place-not of an individual, but slowly of an entire class.
When you see the movie several times, you can enjoy different aspects of it. The dialogue is quick and clever. The performances are for the most part, outstanding.(When you have an ensemble of this size, you're bound to have an off performance or two).
The DVD is outstanding. It features two different voice over ttracks of the film-one from director Altman and one from the writer.

I don't think that I've ever seen a movie that explored these dynamics so successfully.  (Aside:  anybody who sees this and wishes that they were a member of the English aristocracy has problems best dealt with outside of such a hierarchical situation.)
So, what's wrong with it?  Previous reviewers were right in saying that it isn't really a good whodunnit.  That's fine.  Uniquely, though, it becomes almost tedious once something starts happening.  This isn't a fault, really, especially as the the end result adds poignancy to the whole.  It's just that the third act is a little boring, even with the wonderful build up and thought-provoking denouement.

With actors chosen for merit and talent instead of name and face, PARK truly produces a wonderful storyline set in a unique and visually beautiful period.
The overtones of ...  mystery are abound, but the real film lies within the eyes of the actors. Everywhere in the movie you can carefully study the eyes and facial reactions along with the imagination of what each actor is thinking and truly bring a powerful motion picture to heart.",1051315200,2,628,4.761467889908257
1674347,3,B00005V7CT,"Altman's trademark is the interweaving of plot and dialogue, laying the various levels over one another. It works well where the dialogue can be understood, but in this Upstairs/Downstairs film the strong English accents, especially downstairs, make it difficult to understand much of what is being said. That, of course, is the way it is in real life (""What did she say?""), but it's an irritant in a film.
As other reviewers have pointed out, very little actually happens in this film; those expecting action should look elsewhere. It is a period piece along the lines of Masterpiece Theater, but with far better photography and more intelligent conversation. As is often the case with Altman, some elements seem contrived (the presence of the Hollywood director), which detracts from the otherwise fine performance of the actors involved.",1050796800,2,840,5.1838235294117645
1674348,1,B00005V7CT,"I came to this film prepared by the trailer for something on the line of an Agatha Christy mystery. Nothing of the sort happens here.

What Gosford IS is Altman taking another tried and true genre, and trying to play it all ironic and sour and dispassionate and the-end-of-narrative-as-we-know-it, ala The Long Goodbye. (Veddy '70s of the old boy, I do declare.)
If your interest was piqued by the trailer for Gosford, I can almost guarantee you that this film will disappoint your expectations. If you are the type who like films that take no sides, tell no stories and drift along until they simply cease, then you may like this film. Or you may at least be able to act as if you do. --Which, among circles of people who enjoy talking about film more than watching it, is the entire bailiwick, as it were, no?",1049500800,11,901,4.533742331288344

1674351,5,B00005V7CT,"I highly recommend ""Gosford Park"". Its director, Robert Altman, has managed to make an excellent film, full of an english ironic sense of humour that I found (and still find) enchanting.
The main plot revolves around a typical murder mistery (the classical Agatha Christie's ""whodunnit""), that it is very good in itself. However, I specially liked the way in which Altman used the background, a typical english country house, to show us the dynamics of a class (the aristocracy), in a certain period of time (the 1930s), in a certain place (english countryside).
What can happen when a bunch of aristocrats gather together for a shooting party? Well, according to Altman's formula almost everything... The film certainly doesn't lack action, but I believe that what makes it outstanding is how it show us the rigid division among classes in that time (that division still exist now, but they are clearly less patent). One example of that is the upstairs (guests)/downstairs (servants)division of classes.
The main plot is very good, and the various subplots are also greatly entertaining. Regarding the performances of the actors, I specially liked Maggie Smith's as Constance (she was perfect!!!). On the whole, worth seeing and buying...",1047945600,,1239,5.2

I have never seen the physical movement and gesture of the human person shown as beautifully and as subtly as Altman does it here. To me this masterpiece is about movement and how it explains personality and character. Elsie picking up the little dog and handing it off to Sir William in the hall is every bit as impressive as any double play that Chavez and Tejada have ever turned for the A's. (and they turn the most beautiful around the horn double play in baseball.) And Altman gave every character at least one move that I would say was all their own. Maybe the move is just standing there a certain way, like Constance's butler in the first scene did as the car drove away. I've seen it ten times now and the more I see it, the more I see it as a dance. Even though the dialogue was brilliant, I think its purpose was to accent a distinct manner taking place at that moment which is why if some piece of conversation is not heard or followed or understood perfectly, it ain't that big a deal......",1046736000,,1061,4.2835820895522385

Michael Gambon is the murder victim.  Stellar turns from Dame Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas and Helen Miram, among others, make for a fascinating trip to the country.
Alliance has done a fair job mastering the DVD.  Contrast appears a bit low at times and colors are often muted or seemingly dull, sometimes blending together in dark scenes.  Overall, this muted appearance suits the story well.  Fine details occasionally shimmer and there is a bit of edge enhancement that crops up now and then but nothing that terribly distracts.  Overall, this is a great movie that one can never get tired of watching over and over again, particularly because there are so many Altman subtexts working together throughout the plot at any given time.

Gosford Park is a film about a shooting party in the countryside of England with dozens of people visiting the mansion. The owner, Sir William McCordle, has been the objection of hatred by many people and that gives a motive for anyone to kill him. Along with the murder, this film is also about the differences in lifestyle of the workers and of the wealthy. The reason I love Gosford Park is that you can see the movie over and over again and see something new.

It's very complicated, very quiet in some ways.

There's also a nice contrast between British reserve and American directness. Yet, Hollywood needed a hook, and that's where the classic ""well-dressed dinner guests gathered around a body, wondering who could have done it"" device comes in. To Altman's credit, he wisely spends as little time as possible on the actual murder and gives the inspectors who show up hardly any screen time. Good thing, since the real treat here comes in keeping track of all the uniformly wonderful performances, bedroom shenanigans, betrayals, alliances and nasty infighting.

Now lay off you fanboys. I did not like this movie. Though it is very interesting to see just how big an industry an English country estate really was. But as a film it lacks wit. John Cleese was good but not enough to make this a good movie. I am sorry but I have come to the inevitable conclusion that I just do not like Robert Altman's work.

1674362,2,B00005V7CT,"To really understand the film ""Gosford Park"" you need to know that in the 1970s the scriptwriter, actor Julian Fellows, was augmenting his salary as a thespian by trotting out romance novels under the pseudonym ""Rebecca Greville"".
And that, for all the hype and Oscars, is what ""Gosford Park"" really is - a tarted up, upper crust romance novel, with all the attendent shortcomings of that genre.
The cast list is absolutely ""top drawer"", and they do the best they can with what is ultimately a totally meaningless vacuous script.  (I was going to say ""plot"", but in the final analysis the script is neither substantial enough nor coherent enough to warrant such a description).
The film basically concerns a group of society twits who come together for a weekend house party in the 1930s, and the staff who wait upon them.  During the weekend someone gets killed, the police arrive, the murder is solved, and the guests go home.  Roll credits.
Do we learn anything of any consequence about any of the characters?  Far from it.  In fact the characters are uniformly two dimensional, including such tired old stereotypes as the buxom but stupid housemaid who offers her sexual services to any male member of the houseparty who cares to take advantage of them; and a detective so affably bumbling that he'd have a hard time finding his way INTO a brown paper bag, let alone out again.
If there'd been any genuine humour in it, this could at least have been labelled as a ""comedy of manners"".  Unfortunately it is as boring as the house guests, and as transparent as the so-called murder mystery.

The murder, which is led up to cleverly, takes far too long to happen. There are many suspects with overlapping plotlines, but when you unravel them all, they lead nowhere. The ending was a complete bust. It's your typical abovestairs/belowstairs British class system drama. It's more about that than the murder; a dismal let-down when one was expecting a more updated Agatha Christie-type mystery, which is just what the trailer portrayed. There were too many unresolved storylines, some of which were interesting, but destined to remain unexplored. My overall impression is that this is just a slice of a better, more rounded film.

1674369,5,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman's experimental style of throwing a giant ensemble cast into a situation and seeing what they make of it pays off in great measure with this delightful comedy about a giant British manor that is host to many zany guests of different temperaments and personalities. Kristin Scott Thomas and Michael Gambon are the lord and lady of the manor who are entertaining their various relatives and friends for a week-long shooting party, while the servants below stairs clamor to keep up with all the required serving and dressing duties under the direction of the head housekeeper (Helen Mirren). Altman's free-flowing camera follows both the above and under-stairs action until it all comes to a head when a prominent member of the party is murdered by an unknown assailant. Here is where the film takes its most delicious turn: instead of focusing on the mechanics of the murder or concentrating on divulging clues to the audience, the story instead focuses on the reactions by all the other cast members, most hilariously the fact that only one member of the cast, that is the sexy maid played by Emily Watson, actually mourns the deceased. Those looking for a good Mouse Trap-style comedy better rent Clue instead, because this one dispenses of its gumshoe duties early in the investigation process, kicks up its heels and has a great time laughing at its participants. If you're in the mood, or if you're a big fan of the wonderful actors involved, you will too. Kelly Macdonald is perfectly delightful as a visiting servant who lovingly observes the goings-on of the house and brings the plot to its head, and Maggie Smith is a standout as the disgustingly snobbish aunt to Scott Thomas, but probably the most effective performance in the film comes from Mirren-this woman amazes you with the very way she poises herself, ready for duty. The film comfortably resides somewhere just below Nashville or Short Cuts and well above Dr. T and the Women, and unlike Dr. T, the more openly-filmed, improvised scenes blend in seamlessly with the carefully scripted ones, and one can only admire Altman for this immense amount of control that he's shown in his direction with this film.",1041811200,5,2187,4.9135135135135135
1674370,4,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman uses his multi-character, overlapping story style that we loved in Nashville, to make a homage to the Merchant-Ivory style of English movie. I say ""homage"" because it's not a parody.
Altman shot the scenes with very many characters talking at once, often with multiple cameras. The result is convincingly realistic, although the sound quality is often maddeningly muffled and the dialog is difficult to pick up through the various British accents.
The casting is fabulous, and Maggie Smith as the witheringly sharp-tongued dowager is the best. But close behind is Ryan Philippe's impression of an American doing and impression of a Scottish accent deserves an academy award.

1674372,5,B00005V7CT,"The collector's edition DVD of Gosford Park provides comments by Altman and writer, Julian Fellowes as well as documentary on filming the film, out takes and filmography data.  Fellowes comments, however, are wonderful insight to the history of English country house weekends, the arrogance of classism in British social history, as well as providing delightful rememberances of the author's own relations from whom he drew heavily developing his characters.
This is a film of seamless performances from every actor and underscores the strength of theatrical training in the British system over Hollywood's studio celebrity system.  A little bit Agetha Christie, but not really, the story of a dismal weekend in the country is made all the better by Altman's direction, or ability to direct without interference in his actor's performances.
Stellar performances include Maggie Smith (Prime of Miss Jean Brody), delightful as the Countess without a pot to p*#s in, Michael Gambon (The Singing Detective), the victim of greedy in-laws and dog-haters, Jeremy Northam as Ivor Novello delivers blissful musical entertainment to guests and audience alike, Emily Watson (Metroland) demonstrates why she is one of the best young actors working today, and Helen Mirren and Clive Owen are mysterious players in the upstairs-downstairs dilemma.  The depth of cast talent is akin to an archaeology dig, it just keeps getting better as time passes.

I know it won awards, but so do most movies starring Tom Hanks, and I'm sorry, but if that's the official arbiter of excellence, I'll just stay home. Anyway, I read the back of the DVD and figured it would be one of those films that I'd find boring on first viewing, yet gradually begin to appreciate if I bothered with it any further.
Well, it IS rather ""dry."" I found it odd that Altman claims that the ""F-word"" was deliberately insinuated into the script a sufficient number of times to secure an R rating - supposedly to keep teenage boys with too much testosterone from seeing ""Gosford Park."" I should think the testosterone itself would do the job. Nothing explodes in this film, there's nary a lick of that crazy rock music the kids like, nobody gets killed...oh wait, somebody does get killed, but even the murder scene is impossibly dull and boring. Bloodless, antiseptic, British.
This is an ""adult"" film in the true sense. This is a film about adult social politics and intrigue and gossip, about the strange edgy relationship between these indefatiguably haughty upper-crust aristocrats and the ever-complacent servants they depend upon for every least personal function, yet whom they openly revile as congenitally inferior. It would be rash to presume that the plush and pampered ""Upstairs"" life is really any easier psychologically than the cramped and calloused ""Downstairs"" life, however. ""Gosford Park"" is an interesting investigation of what happens when the constraints and tabus of this sort of caste system render the lives of everyone involved practically intolerable. The servants have been just as thoroughly conditioned to automatic submission as outright slaves. Their entire existence is drudgery; their only dignity is vicarious; they acquire the pretensions and snobberies of their masters and often turn viciously and hypocritically on one another. Yet the aristocrats themselves, who never have to flex a muscle for the most trifling amenity, have been driven by inevitable boredom and inertia to likewise ruthlessly intrigue against each other purely to while away the time and maintain the status-quo. Their insanely regulated and mannered lifestyle is as nigh impossible for them to embody as it is for their servants to set up. As such, everybody all-around is miserable, conspiratory, two-faced, paranoid, vindictive, jealous, insecure, chasing after an ideal which can never be realized. This social climate is the perfect breeding ground for every sort of moral dis-ease.
Nice craft on everybody's part really nails this home. Each actor - from Maggie Smith as an excruciatingly pompous, impudent, willfully-helpless old mummy of a Lady, to Sir William McCordle as a fat, nasty, overbearing slob, to Kristen Scott Thomas as a harsh, withering, jaded, manipulative Marlene Dietrich doppelganger - was fitted with an individual mic so that multiple simultaneous conversations in a scene could be recorded and then mixed to allow salient bits to come through in the final cut. This invests ""Gosford Park"" with a certain realism and allows the viewer to feel like an invisible voyeur wandering amongst these complicated proceedings and catching both relevant and irrelevant snippets.
Am I recommending it? I suppose I am. I did enjoy this film precisely because I'm the type that tends to get caught up in the minutiae of period customs and conventions, which are evidently rendered with exacting accuracy in ""Gosford.""

1674380,2,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park (Robert Altman, 2001)
I was truly a glutton for punishment this weekend&#151;not only a Joel Schumacher film, but one by Robert Altman, as well. Altman has been trying for thirty-two years to make another film as good as M*A*S*H. He hasn&#146;t succeeded yet, though Gosford Park is the closest he&#146;s come to it. Like M*A*S*H, Altman here assembles an exceptionally high-powered cast, containing too many both rising and established stars to single anyone out, and throws them into a situation; here, a hunting party. Mismarketed as a mystery film, this is actually something of a drawing-room drama.
Unfortunately, it seems Altman considered it a mystery film, as well, because the pace and character development necessary to films of the latter sort is utterly absent. The viewer is rushed through plotline after plotline, given almost nothing to go on in each episode and no time at all to get to know the characters. No one is onscreen long enough for us to develop an affinity for any of the plotlines (of which the much ballyhooed murder of the host, played by Michael Gambon [Longitude] is only one, and a minor one at that), and a few characters jump plotlines as readily as some characters jump from bed to bed.
There was much to work with here, and in a movie two or three times as long, it might have all been done justice. As it is, the performances by such brilliant actors as Emily Watson, Clive Owen, and Helen Mirren do nothing but hint at what might have been found had any of them had enough screen time to really start developing. (Mirren, as always, should be singled out; what little screen time she has is riveting.)
That Gosford Park was nominated for both Best Picture and Best Director in a year when such films as The Others, Donnie Darko, Monsters, Inc., Shrek, Y Tu Mama Tambien, The Man Who Wasn&#146;t There, (oh, you get the idea) were ignored for both awards is ludicrous. **",1036800000,9,1924,4.729166666666667
1674381,5,B00005V7CT,"This film is a period masterpiece.  Altman has captured aristocratic England of the 1930's perfectly.  In a fashion similar to ""Titanic,"" the creators of this film wanted to ""get it right,"" and conducted extensive research on the etiquette of the period.  Ancient butlers, maids, and footmen were enlisted to share their memories, coach the actors, and ensure that the film reflected the reality of the era. Period wallpaper was recreated.  Authentic locations were employed.
The special features included on the DVD are stellar; there are two separate commentaries, one by Robert Altman and one by Julian Fellows, the screenwriter-  both worth listening to. The dialogue is a bit hard to catch at times.  One solution: turn on the English subtitles.  This can help the American ear that is not tuned to British inflection.
This is a film you can watch again and again, and you will catch new subtleties each time.  The ensemble cast shines.  The connections between those who serve and those served are intricate on many levels (physical, sensual, spiritual...).  A few stand-outs: Maggie Smith, at her Bette-Davis-acerbic finest; Jeremy Northam, who plays the fading (real) film star Ivor Novello, and does a wonderful job singing period songs; the delightful Emily Watson; Helen Mirrin, in an understated, subtle performance as the housekeeper; Alan Bates as the alcoholic butler; Clive Owen as a valet with a secret.
If you get a warm spot in your heart when you think of Brideshead Revisited, Howards End, and other period pieces, this is a film for you.  If you love superb acting at its finest, and the art of filmmaking, buy this DVD.  You will find a superior film plus a world of bonus material.  Enjoy!",1036627200,6,1713,4.98943661971831
1674382,2,B00005V7CT,"I don't know, but I want to give it a go.
My main objection to the film differs from those who had trouble picking up on the conversation, who disliked its rather shopworn depiction of English class warfare, who objected to the murky sound, who were annoyed by the highly stylized ensemble playing by an admittedly brilliant cast; these were merely annoyances for me.
I object to this film because I feel it has neither heart nor soul--it's all surfaces (albeit, slick ones, as one expects in an Altman film), except for a rather nasty view of the human condition that leaks out between the frames.  Are people really as mean-spirited, arch, bungling, stupid, and unlikeable as this sick crew of characters?  Not in my experience.  Could the British class system really have been as dreadful as it appears in this film?  I doubt it.  We get an entirely different picture of English life in, say, Dorthoy Sayers or J. R. R. Tolkien or Evelyn Waugh--one that strikes me as a lot more true-to-life and balanced.  Really, this film is very heavy handed, almost ideological, in its depiction of troubled relations between classes.  Yes, Kelly MacDonald as Mary, Lady Trentham's wide-eyed-but-not-as-naive-as-she-seems Lady's Maid, brings some welcome relief to these morose goings on, but for me it is too little to rescue the on-screen shambles that played out before my befuddled eyes.
Now I'll come completely clean.  I haven't very much liked any of the Altman films I've seen, and generally for the same sort of reasons.  For me, he sacrifices style for content, he has a warped view of humanity, he delights in confusion and misdirection, and he deconstructs without concomitant reconstruction, a formula for unsatisfactory art.

Altman's movie is a study is the British class structure, the upstairs and the downstairs, and how they interact and deal with one another.  The movie is told from the point of view of a ladies maid, and the movie concerns itself with the relationships between the hierarchy of the servants, and of the socialites.  Small gossip is passed from level to level,...information is gathered about family and money and smart one liners are traded back and forth.
But suddenly murder strikes, the head of the house is poisoned and then stabbed, and the bumbling inspector is brought in.  He is snubbed by the servants, and scorned by their masters, and the murder is left to stand, with nobody caring enough to do or say anything...

The later films, like Cookie's Fortune and Gosford Park, I turn inside out, like an empty coat pocket, searching for the Altman of old, alas to find that he really isn't there, and beginning to wonder if he ever was in the first place.
To a part of Altman's audience, the absence of dynamics from his work is a premium seal of his seriousness as an artist. There was always a lack of affect in Altman's films, even in his best work, a Dreyer-like, Bresson-like reticence to direct the audience's experience of the material of the story, or in other words, to give that story dramatic shape. There are no Spielbergian cues in all of Altman. He leaves it to his audience to sort through the uncollated heaps of data, and make of the time spent what they will. Flattered as I am by his trust in me as a sort of information sieve, I wish he would exert himself just a little more as a storyteller, a narrator, a dramatist. --Now more than ever. The part of the audience that is made feel brainy by the postmodern eschewing of shape are welcome to it.

1674389,4,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is a highly entertaining British upstairs/downstairs whodunnit set in a 1930's stately home, which examines the social relationships and etiquette of the era and is filled with excellent one-liners and an excellent cast.
Opening with a cross-section of British high society arriving at a stately mansion for a weekend shooting party along with their servants at Gosford Park, it is not long before the upstairs downstairs politics of master and servant (illicit sexual trysts, dodgy business deals and unspoken heirarchy's are revealed). Eventually of course the bitter politics and sordid double-dealings lead to the murder of the lord of the manor, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and so the movie transforms from social commentary (with black comedy) to a whodunnit murder mystery. Although, as is eventually revealed, its less of a whodunnit and more of a who cares because it transpires that Sir William was such a loathsome and morally reprehensible character that his  loss is mourned by (next to) nobody. And so with a houseful of suspects, both upstairs and downstairs, the task of solving Sir William's murder is assigned to the hapless Inspector Thompson (Stephen Fry), a dithering idiot who contaminates the crime scene and is bullied by the aristocrats. He ignores all the obvious clues much to the frustration of his uniformed working class assistant, whilst the guests try to conceal their deepest darkest secrets.
For Gosford Park, a kind of cross between Remains of The Day and an Agatha Christie novel, Director Robert Altman has assembled the cream of British acting talent and provided them with a sparkling script by screenwriter Julian Fellowes. Full of wit and insight, the script provides wonderful material for all its excellent ensemble cast which includes, above stairs; Michael Gambon is the grumpy lord of the manor and Kristin Scott Thomas (The English Patient) his very elegant but dissafected wife. Charles Dance (White Mischief) plays 'war hero' Lord Stockdale, and Geraldine Somerville (Arthur/Harry Potter) his wife. The excellent Jeremy Northam (The Net/Enigma/Emma) is acclaimed songwriter Ivor Novello, and James Wilby (Howard's End) plays the Honorable Freddie Nesbitt, to name but a few.
Downstairs the servants include; Ryan Phillipe (Cruel Intentions/Antitrust), Helen Mirren (2010/The Mosquito Coast), Richard E. Grant (Withnail and I/Bram Stoker's Dracula), Alan Bates (The Sum of All Fears, Women In Love), Derek Jacobi (Gladiator/Dead Again), Emily Watson (Angela's Ashes/Breaking The Waves/Red Dragon), Clive Owen and Kelly MacDonald. Particularly good amongst this cast are (perhaps surprisingly) Clive Owen (Croupier/The Bourne Identity), who is a good bet to be the next 007, and Kelly MacDonald (Trainspotting) as Mary, Lady Trentham's Lady's Maid. However it is Dame Maggie Smith (Harry Potter/The prime of Miss Jean Brodie) that steals the show as the acid tongued Lady Trentham.
This is undoubtedly Robert Altman's best movie for some time perhaps since The Player and definitely since Short Cuts. Infinitely superior to Altman's last outing, the ill-judged Dr T and the Women, Gosford Park is a very elegant movie performed by a faultless cast and even if the ending is a little flat and unsatisfactory, Gosford Park is never less than entertaining.

What reviewers fail to realize is that they didn't understand the plot precisely because it is not flashed in their faces in neon letters.  The murderer is revealed at the very end through rather unique means and I bet you never would have guessed who done it!  The interesting part for me is the fact that life goes on for most of the characters as if nothing happened.  But that is the message of Gosford Park, I think:  life in inter-war England was like that.  Servants behaved as they should, masters as they should, everyone had his place, the King was in his castle, God was in his heaven, and the sun never set on the British Empire.  It was the end of those times.  I love how this movie portrays the abject boredom of ""what is done"".  Excellent story.

Taking advantage of a splendid cast, a sharply focused script and the fresh English setting, GOSFORD park emerges as one of the most satisfying of Robert Altman's numerous ensemble pictures, What makes the achievement of GOSFORD PARK all the more remarkable is that Mr. Altman is 76....The energy that crackles from the screen suggests the clear-sighted joie de vivre of an artist still deeply engaged in the world,an all-star British ensemble cast, the film recalls both THE RULES OF THE GAME and THE REMAINS OF THE DAY, with a midpoint shift to an Agatha Christie whodunit. In November 1932, a phalanx of moneyed guests arrives for a weekend shooting party at the estate of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas). Mary (Kelly Macdonald), a fresh-faced, nave new maid accompanies the sniping Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), and is shown the ropes by the house's worldly head housemaid, Elsie (Emily Watson). While the masters engage in various financial and sexual intrigues upstairs, the world downstairs has its own curiosities--namely, the predatory valet to a Hollywood producer, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe), and the mysterious, cagey servant, Robert Parks (Clive Owen). Mary soon discovers that the image of servants living vicariously through their masters is a false one, and that the upstairs-downstairs worlds are often shockingly interwoven. With GOSFORD PARK, Altman delivers a fascinating, blackly comic look at the treacherous yet poignant gamesmanship between the classes. This is fresh and original movie...very subtle funny...with, scandal, mystery, murder this is a must see.
Synopsis...from Gosford parks Offical Website:
Robert Altman, one of Americas most distinctive filmmakers, journeys to England for the first time to create a unique film mosaic with an outstanding ensemble cast. It is November, 1932. Gosford Park is the magnificent country estate to which Sir William McCordle and his wife, Lady Sylvia, gather relations and friends for a shooting party. They have invited an eclectic group including a countess, a World War I hero, the British matinee idol Ivor Novello and an American film producer who makes Charlie Chan movies. As the guests assemble in the gilded drawing rooms above, their personal maids and valets swell the ranks of the house servants in the teeming kitchens and corridors below-stairs. But all is not as it seems: neither amongst the bejewelled guests lunching and dining at their considerable leisure, nor in the attic bedrooms and stark work stations where the servants labor for the comfort of their employers. Part comedy of manners and part mystery, the film is finally a moving portrait of events that bridge generations, class, sex, tragic personal history  and culminate in a murder. (Or is it two murders?)Ultimately revealing the intricate relations of the above and below-stairs worlds with great clarity, Gosford Park illuminates a society and way of life quickly coming to an end.",1033689600,,3067,5.336776859504132
1674395,4,B00005V7CT,"This is an early 20th century English country house murder mystery.  It is probably the last vehicle I would have ever imagined Altman interested in making as a film.  I prefer his edgier work, such as the bitingly black comedy, ""The Player.""  However, Altman doesn't make bad movies and that is true here.  It is an ensemble piece, which is true of most of his work.  Everyone in it does a fine job and some of my favorite actors are here.  Scott-Thomas as the wife-aristocrat who loves the life but can barely stand her older, titled husband is just this side of total acid scorn laced with civility.

Maggie Smith does another droll turn as the poor relative who is a worse snob and more difficult than anyone else present.  The wonderful Clive Owen is a pivotal character who increasingly piques our curiousity.  Helen Mirren seems totally unsympathetic at first but we do come to understand her character. She renders a well nuanced performance of a complex character.  Most astonishing, Jeremy Northam is an excellent singer and does a marvelous turn entertaining the house guests.  All in all, well done and entertaining, but not among my legion of absolute favorite Altman films.

1674396,4,B00005V7CT,"I have read the many reviews, good and not-so-good, and found myself laughing at the not-so-good ones.  It appears that many viewers ""just didn't get it"".  Altman did not make a ""real whodonit"" mystery movie.  He made a movie reflecting the everyday life of society in 1930's England--the upperclass or upstairs group, and the servant or downstairs group.  The murder is just another subplot in the many subplots of the film.  I found the direction seamless--the flow between showing life upstairs to that of life downstairs was invisible.  The actors portrayed their character's part to perfection.  Just look at Helen Mirren's performance and tell me you couldn't differentiate between the actor and the character.  For my money, I would have given Mirren the Oscar.  I love these types of movies that delve into character acting.  I find too few of them on today's market which produce more movies about special effects and explosions and less on character study.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Jeremy Northam sing and play.  I understand a couple of the songs were done ""live""; that is, he did not record them first in a sound studio but rather was filmed as he sang and played.  I saw the film twice at the theatre and several more times when I bought the DVD recently.  I encourage readers to check out the commentary track done by the writer, Julian Fellowes.  His description of the movie is very revealing and interesting.  Many of the scenes were taken from 'real life' experiences, such as the opening scene.  He describes how his aunt would never let her driver attach the roof over his head on the car, even if it was raining.  He said she always wanted to preserve the rank of distinction.  Altman's commentary is a bit dry and he does not go into too much detail in many areas.  I would have given this movie 5 stars except I found the sound quality not very good on the DVD.  I had to turn up the volume quite a bit on my entertainment centre to properly hear the dialogue.

In ""Gosford Park"" I think he has _had_ to keep things under control or, as a complex murder mystery, the plot wouldn't work. I think the historical accuracy of the clothes, the props, the house, is all amazing (This film could never have been done in the US). I think there are a couple annoyances about the plot however: How does the protagonist (the young ladies' maid) figure out who (she thinks) done it (the scene after her pal says ""Carpe Diem)? Plus, a plot point that hinges on an American actor playing an American actor doing a bad Scottish accent - Very tricky. There are too many American actors doing full-on bad UK accents, that this is too much to ask of an audience.

However, within the two groups there is also a hierarchy and a very definite line of authority.  There is sexual dalliance within and between the two groups.  When a murder occurs, the atmosphere suddenly changes to one of suspicion and mutual finger-pointing.  The sets and costumes are lavish and lovely and this movie is a real treat to the eye and the ear.  There are many talented and well-known actors in the film, many of them playing small parts brilliantly.",1032393600,2,777,4.840909090909091
1674403,4,B00005V7CT,"Inside ""Gosford Park"", which is a good movie, is a great movie that never quite gets out. It can be taken as a standard parlor murder mystery or as a study in class warfare, but it comes up a tad short on each count. The movie opens on an appropriately dank and gloomy twilight in the English countryside, at a manor house which is the scene of a weekend party during which milord will turn up most foully murdered. Sound familiar? It's been done before, a dozen and more times; and of course we learn during the subsequent unraveling of the mystery that the old coot richly deserved what he got. There is some delicious interacting between upstairs and downstairs; it's hard to tell who are more snobbish, the upper-class guests or their servants belowstairs (the servants have their own hierarchy which is as rigid, if not more so, than they entire British class system), and at the film's end, we finally find out whodunit. But despite some really marvelous performances by Maggie Smith as the snooty countess (she's priceless lounging in her boudoir with those cucumber slices over her eyes), Helen Mirren as the head servant with a skeleton in her closet, Alan Bates as the butler (no, he didn't do it), and Kristen Scott-Thomas as the rich man's wife, we're somehow left with a feeling that this film is lacking something. The ending seems curiously flat. One comes away from watching the movie with a feeling of ""Is this all?""
There is a serious problem with the DVD which bears mentioning. The sound quality is terrible. At first I assumed it was me, since I am hearing-impaired; but even with the volume on my TV jacked to the max, it sounded poor. After checking the sound on a few other DVDs, I realized it wasn't me or my TV; the problem was the sound engineering on this DVD. However, the closed captions are excellent and let me follow the script with no trouble.
Overall, ""Gosford Park"" is an enjoyable film. There's just this realization that great sets, great costumes, and great performances don't add up to a great movie. It's a good movie, but one that could have been better.",1031702400,2,2096,4.637096774193548
1674404,5,B00005V7CT,"This film is a bitter pill examining class and wealth, wrapped in an entertaining, tasty movie that makes it easier to swallow.  The disparity between the very wealthy and the poor is evident in every frame, especially when the two classes must relate to one another.  Observe how deferential are those who actually work for a living, toward their capitalist master who can choose to give or withhold ""his"" money according to his whim.  The way John Hammond just waltzes into Dr. Grant's and Dr. Ellie Satler's trailer and opens their champagne never fails to infuriate me.  I weep when the two paleontologists, after a show of defiance, wilt into obsequious obedience when Hammond dangles money in front of them.
Not to say that this movie is dull or preachy about its anti-capitalist values.  The dinosaurs are pretty cool.  Plus they obviously represent the lowest levels of society, who will one day throw off their manipulating masters, rise in rebellion, and eat lawyers right off their outhouse seats.  I don't know which I enjoy more, the fight between the classes or the fight between the velociraptors and the T-rex.  I do know that seeing Maggie Smith (starring as Dr. Ellie Satler) in tight shorts and t-shirt is a treat worth waiting 50 million years for!",1031702400,,1268,4.865116279069768

The period dress, accents and furnishings are very close to authentic.  Great movie watching if you are interested in background as well as the actors.  Maggie Smith is in rare form and brings her wonderful timing to scenes that would not be funny without her.
If you have trouble with accents, watch it twice.  Each viewing brings fresh insight and better understanding.  I recommend this movie highly.",1031356800,,511,4.75
1674406,5,B00005V7CT,"The first time I saw Gosford Park, I must admit I was disappointed.  I love old period dramas for the costumes, the sets, the dialogue.  I was not disappointed with the setting of the film, an opulent English country house, but rather with what on first blush seemed to me to be a lack of cohesive plot. Not to be impatient with this film, because the plot comes together at the very end of the story, like all good who-done-its do.  And not to be impatient with the rest of it, either. Appreciate the character development, the perfect casting, the tension created in weaving the sub-plots together, the 1930's style soundtrack. Once I let the film jell and gave the true complexity of it a chance to make sense, it seemed only right to watch it again.  Again, and again.  Better with each watching, noticing nuances missed before.  Don't sell this film short, because it has much more than first meets the eye, and it is worth sticking around a few times to savor the Altman magic.",1031356800,,983,4.52542372881356
1674407,5,B00005V7CT,"This movie is not for those with short attention spans or those who are held by a great plot. Not to say that just because you aren't captivated by this movie you're automatically stupid... but a great many people won't have the same capacity for enjoying this movie that I had.
Some people thought that the huge number of substantial characters prevented them from being developed well, but one of Altman's great strengths as a director is to give a character no more than 10 minutes of significant screen time but still tell you their whole life story and make them incredibly moving. The best examples of this in the film are the characters of the thoughtful, plaintive Ivor Novello, the neglected, looked-down-upon Mabel, and the weasely but sympathetic Commander Meredith, three characters that I'll admit had little impact on me upon first viewing but grew on me greatly as I watched more and more.
Which brings me to an important point... this movie MUST be watched more than once to be appreciated. Don't expect to get everything the first time, and don't make the mistake of watching the movie as a murder mystery, waiting for the crime to be committed. This is not the point of the film, and the crime is not committed until more than halfway through the film.
The show is stolen though, by those performances who really do make a big impact on first viewing: namely, those of Maggie Smith as the delightfully snobbish Countess of Trentham, Kristin Scott Thomas as the husband-loathing, cold-but-sexy Lady Sylvia, Kelly McDonald the understatedly charming lady's maid Mary, and especially Helen Mirren as the head housekeeper with a sordid past, Mrs. Wilson (a performance that deserved the Oscar it was nominated for... though a smaller role, Mirren's performance towers over the generic Jennifer Connelly, who robbed her of the Oscar).
In short, if you're looking for fun, wit, humor, intrigue, mystery, tragedy, and a wealth of great characters, then Gosford Park is a cinematic experience that will not be forgotten!",1031356800,,2030,4.956011730205279
1674408,5,B00005V7CT,"""Gosford Park"" is one of the few movies that I would enjoy seeing a second time.  In fact, it might take two viewings to catch all the visual and verbal nuances of the production.  Fans of the PBS series ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" will enjoy this mystery.  We are treated to views of two worlds: The wealthy houseparty guests with their secrets, their world-weariness, and their compromises, contrasted with the herd of servants who tend to their every need, and spend any spare time gossiping about their employers.  There's a sweet scene as one of the guests, a well-known entertainer, plays the piano and sings.  Most of the guests ignore him, but the servants gather near the doors and windows and stand entranced, swept away by the romantic music.

  Maggie Smith plays an aging relative who needs money, but who smacks her lips over a good breakfast and still enjoys the sensual side of life.  Hers is only one of many excellent performances.  ""Gosford Park"" is a can't miss, especially for the Anglophiles among us.  Highly recommended.",1031184000,,1039,4.88
1674409,3,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is an interesting movie, it has the Upstairs Downstairs class depictions (though not as well done as the mini-series), good character development and a murder mystery which seems to be incidental to the whole film.  Some good performances from all, especially Maggie Smith and Emily Watson, who stood out for me.  My whole problem with this movie is that it takes so much time developing characters and setting the scene that the plot suffers as a result.  I found the whole movie somewhat static, and it lacked direction and focus.  I have never been a fan of Altman's, another director could have done better with this genre.  It's a good film, it just cries out for editing.",1030665600,,690,4.764705882352941
1674410,5,B00005V7CT,"Hmmm...where to begin? Gosford Park is unlike any other film I've ever seen, and I think that's the very reason I like it.
The plot, at first glance, seems to be simple enough (in fact, it's oddly reminiscent of a game of 'Clue'): A man invites several guests from all walks of life, unacquainted with each other, to his English country house for the week-end. Everything seems to go along well enough, until the master of the house turns up murdered.
That is where Gosford Park's resemblance to your average whodunit stops. In fact, the murder doesn't occur till nearly 2/3 through the film. First, we get the chance to be intimately acquainted with the characters in the house: the upstairs staff, the downstairs staff, the kitchen staff, and the glittery 'upstairs' house-guests whose lives they make possible.
The story is told more in hints than in broad statements, which I find refreshing. The screenplay is by the talented Julian Fellowes (you may recognise him as having been the Prince Regent in the 'Sharpe' films) and flows effortlessly and wittily. My favourite character was undoubtedly Dame Maggie Smith's 'Countess Constance' - she's so much of a narcissist it's hilarious to watch. Helen Mirren also does a brilliant job as the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson. There are so many other stars in this film it would be impossible to list them all in a review: the cast-list reads like a showcase of the best of British talent.",1030665600,,1433,4.853061224489796

1674412,5,B00005V7CT,"For my money, no director working today knows better what to do with a huge ensemble than Robert Altman. Regrettably, he didn't win the Oscar this year for Best Director which remains a bit of a mystery (pun intended) to me. ""Gosford Park"" is arguably his most ambitious work to date. To some viewers, the film meanders quite a bit for more than an hour, flittering back and forth between the frantic work pace and never-ending preparations of the downstairs household staff and their employers lush, opulent living and activities upstairs, all during the course of a shooting weekend in the English Countryside. The standout performances include a devilishly spoiled Maggie Smith (whose character as she puts it 'hasn't a snobbish bone in her body') and Kristin Scott Thomas as the lady of the manor whose icy demeanor is off-putting to most but quite attractive to young fellow posing as a servant (a sly and witty Ryan Phillipe). The murder mystery, it has been reported in the entertainment press, wasn't actually added to the film until about 6 weeks into the shoot but you would hardly know since the gradual buildup to that crescendo is so brilliant and almost off-handed! After watching this terrific cast of A-list actors scurry about thier daily activities and then settle into a game of bridge, Brandy, conversation and music (provided by the dashing and alternately grating Jeremy Northam at the piano) a blood-curdling scream from the study snaps everyone from their selfish state and thrusts the film forward to a surprising and satisfying finish. I won't give away more than that (in case you haven't seen it yet) but I will say that there is another tasty little subplot involving two downstairs service people (a magnificent Helen Mirren and Clive Owen). Special kudos to the set designers and costume department for a job well done and for some of the most lush cinematography in recent film history!
Brilliant.",1030579200,2,1929,4.95679012345679
1674413,4,B00005V7CT,"Judged purely as a mystery story, this is a fabulous movie.  I guarantee you'll never guess 'whodunit.'  The characters are memorable, the dialogue (much of it improvised, according to the director) is barbed, the revelations are satisfying.
But.
It could have been so much better.  If only we had been allowed to get to know the most important characters more deeply.  If only we could have cared more about the murder victim.  If only the cleverness hadn't been allowed to overshadow the humanity of the characters.
While watching this, I couldn't help but recall how much I loved ""Remains of the Day,"" with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.  In that movie the maids and butlers and housekeepers really do become real people for us, and we care immensely about what happens to them.  In contrast with that, the Gosford Park characters are rather two-dimensional, with a bit of 'cartoon' about them.  There's too much that's already familiar from any Agatha Christie story you've ever seen or read-- the villain who deserves to die, the back-stabbing spoiled children of the wealthy mansion owners, the society idols who refuse to acknowledge that their servants have feelings.
A bit more time spent on each major character would have overcome this.  Helen Mirren is an incredible actress and usually moves me greatly, but here she isn't given enough to work with, and I find myself curiously indifferent to the emotions she displays at the plot's climax.  She's convincing, but she never moves me.
Yes, it's a really good movie.  It could have been great.",1030320000,6,1558,4.953846153846154

Don't be tricked as i was by the trailer thinking this is a murder mystry, it is not, the trailer shows scenes from the last half hour. this is a terriable movie, the only redeming qualities were the performances. but even thoughs couldn't save this sorry excuse for a movie",1030320000,8,669,4.1937984496124034

1674416,5,B00005V7CT,"Over the years, Robert Altman has proved as elusive as his films to classify or to try to get the definitive pulse from. His films are at once quite focused and yet all over the place. The predominating feature of each of the films is that it is an attempt to define and describe a kind of insane little aspect of the world, as in ""MASH"", ""The Player"", or  ""Nashville"".  He seems intrigued by the way in which earnestness and sophistry pass through the lens of every observer, so that while we believe we are viewing something in all due reference, he is poking fun at our attempt. Yet he is still standing there next to us, peering through that same small knothole and straining to try to understand whatever it is that is going inside that small space we can see beyond the wooden wall.
For Altman, life is messy and hard to discern, and a lot of the dialogue in his films suffer from the same level of noise and discord. Yet no one seems as uniquely capable at capturing all of the noisome nuances of human interaction in its full range of pathos and progress than does Altman. As in MASH, his depiction of the nature of life in an English ""cottage"" is a masterpiece of such imaginings. The cast here is superb, including Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, and Kristin Scott Thomas as the rulers of this limited universe, as well as others such as Kelly MacDonald, Alan Bates, Helen Mirren, and Clive Owen as the working class stiffs just trying to scheme their way through the day.
Altman pokes great fun at both sides of the socioeconomic divide, and it is the nature of the class-ordained behavior that provides the foundation for this look at life in the English countryside. While it has commonly been observed before that a hard a difficult life has its rewards, especially allowing for a more realistic appreciation of the gifts of life, never has it been done so gracefully, imaginatively, and with such roaring good humor and repartee as here.  Certainly, Altman's fondness for noise and chaos furthers this search for the truth in the situation as nothing else could. The film is entertaining, worthwhile, and extremely well done. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!",1030060800,8,2168,4.640625

The so-called investigators were Laurel & Hardy England, I mean Britain style. Why they were added into the movie is beyond me.  If there was an investigation, will someone please tell me!!
I don't have a problem that someone else figured it out who done it and why, it just that the movie was took too long to get there, and if, if the Laurel & Hardy investigators DID any type of investigation, the director FAILED to show this.  Other than that, the scenery was beautiful.

The form and structure of the movie follows that archetypical mystery structure, but the film is one of the most remarkable commentaries on class and family in a bygone era captured by camera. Credit Julian Fellows for his excellent screenplay. The script captures the era, the atmosphere and mannerisms of the people inhabiting it to a perfect pitch, and Robert Altman is as game as ever in transposing Fellows' vision to film as only he can. This is definitely Altman's best film since ""The Player"". Ensemble acting is superb; the actors are unselfish in a refreshingly anti-Hollywood way. It brings a smile to my face to see a film that treats the subject matter of the story with more reverence than the actors' egos. The disc itself is gorgeous; the commentaries and special features are generous and edifying - they enrich the understanding of the film.

1674419,4,B00005V7CT,"After the intimate joy that was 'Short Cuts', Altman's previous sprawling movie treat, there are some surprises and some things that come as expected from 'Gosford Park'.  With a cast that is simply magnificent, although no doubt many non-British audiences will not know who several of the cast members are as several are mostly famed for theatre.  The basic premise has a group of people gathering at a stately home to observe a shooting party, with a line being clearly drawn between the well-to-do folk and those that serve on them.  However, as various plot threads begin unravelling a murder takes place that sends everything into freefall.
Altman is the kind of brave director that doesn't opt for the easy option of setting off all his fireworks in the first round.  Indeed, with such a huge cast (all of whom are impeccable) he manages to extract extraordinary depth and character from every single one so that we can really sympathise with them or detest them.  These aren't the usual cardboard movie characters but real human beings.  Of course, the cast itself is an enormous asset.  Dame Maggie Smith proves why she is such a legend with a glorious performance, although there's really nothing to fault with the cast.  It's an absolute delight to see Emily Watson, such a talented actress who was so spectacular in 'Hilary And Jackie' on top form as well as a hard-done-by servant.
Whilst it's all too easy to go over-the-top with describing all there is to admire about this film, it's probably worth remembering that if long period dramas aren't your thing then maybe you're best clear of this.  Still, this is a lot more accessible than 'Short Cuts' was (without disparaging either) and that certainly should help it gain an audience, something this accomplished and very adult piece of filmmaking surely deserves.",1029542400,4,1829,4.912337662337662
1674420,5,B00005V7CT,"This 2001 award-winning film takes place in 1932 in a country house in England.  Guests have assembled for a shooting party and the servants are busy.  It's a perfect setting for a classic murder mystery.  But Robert Altman is the director, and so the limitations of the genre disappear in a multi-layered story with a cast of no less than 35 characters. Each character shines for a brief moment as this very interesting tale moves back and forth between the guests and the servants, making a joke out of upper class snobbery while, at the same time showing how dependent they are on the servant class.
Julian Fellowes received an Academy Award for the screenplay, which was based on an idea by Robert Altman and Bob Balaban, who also appears in the film in a comedic role of a Hollywood producer.  It's fun to watch all the characters interact as little by little we learn how they are all connected.  Each one is in a life and death struggle for something.  And each one has some sort of secret.  As the film progresses, I found myself saying ""ah ha"" a lot at each sign of recognition.
The cast is terrific:  Maggie Smith as a countess who is dependent on her brother, the lord of the estate, for her income; Kristin Scott Thomas as the wife of the rich man; Helen Mirren as the housekeeper with a deep secret; Emily Watson as a maid; Alan Bates as the head butler.  Accolades could just go on and on.  There's masterful acting here.
The DVD is full of interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits as Robert Altman describes the process for getting the best performances from the actors.  There's even a whole section devoted to the film's authenticity as some real-life servants who worked in an English country house in the 1930s were hired to advise the producers on every detail of service at that time, down to the color of the bow tie that the footman wore.
This film is destined to be a classic in its own right. I give it one of my highest recommendations.  Don't miss it!",1029369600,10,1975,4.532394366197183
1674421,3,B00005V7CT,"GOSFORD PARK is a solid piece of moviemaking, even if its'  not director Robert Altman's best work.  Alot of the blame, I think, lies with the plot, which isn't fleshed out much, leaving much of the acting talent to rely on snappy dialogue built around a somewhat hollow shell.  Though it's touted as an Agatha  Christie-style murder mystery, the murder itself doesn't even happen until well into the movie, and the movie has moved so slowly up to that point that it almost seems like just another irrelevant (lack of) plot point.  On the plus side, as with most Altman films, the acting is top-drawer, highlighted by the brilliance of both Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren(in the film's finest performance).  Overall, GOSFORD PARK is pretty good, again far from Altman's best, and ultimately highly overrated.",1028937600,7,807,4.940740740740741

But wait, there's two more hours of this to come, as the director relentlessly hits us over the head with the ""below stairs"" message.  Has he never seen Upstairs Downstairs?  Apparently not, nor have the millions of critics who loved this movie I guess.  It's been done before, and done better.  But the worst crime of this murder mystery I think is the lack of a murder mystery.  There is a murder, but no mystery, and no hint of the Christie-esque charm and suspense the reviews and trailers led one to believe would be there.  And the murder takes so long to occur that when it finally does, you find yourself wishing it was you!  If you've heard that the British well-to-do were both dull and snobbish, this movie wants to prove it to you, about a dozen different boring ways.

1674424,5,B00005V7CT,"I finally got around to watching Gosford Park on DVD, which was important for two reasons.  First, I could turn on the sub-titles because I was having a hard time following what everybody was saying (a point on which I observe I am not alone).  Second, the only thing I remembered about the movie was that we only see the rich folks when the servants are around.  This latter point was more important because it meant I did not really remember that the film was about and since I was not the one that picked up the DVD at the store, I did not see the cover with the rather subtle clue as to what would be going on eventually in this tale.
Aside: I was going to see this film in the theater after it was nominated for the Oscar for Best Picture, but you see I live in a town where after the nominations came out last year TWO OF THE MOVIES LEFT TOWN.  But then, I suppose we should just be grateful they came here at all (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" only came to the local ""art"" theater).
Actually I was enjoying watching the film without worrying what it was about.  The cast was weaving their little tapestry, but all those bottles of poison I kept seeing lying around seemed a bit foreboding.  No for me it was a pleasant surprise when it turned into a whodunit rather than a character study.  Yet clearly this is a quirky whodunit, since the investigating inspector does not get to finish a sentence for about a half hour during the proceedings.  He also seems to make a point of not looking at the clues, but that turns out alright because none of the clues are the real clues anyhow.
Besides, it is hard not to figure out whodunit, or at least half of it, which should lead to you figuring it all out, but you are never quite sure.  What delighted me about this film was that having figured out not only the ""who"" but what I thought was the ""why,"" I was pleasantly surprised to find another twist that made for a wholly satisfying conclusion in my opinion.
The cast, of course, is impeccable, which you can tell by the fact that Derek Jacobi is wasted in a small role; he must have wanted to work with Altman.  Maggie Smith is at the point where she can play parts like this in her sleep and while her Oscar nomination was a given, I would like to point out that Helen Mirren, the other Oscar nominated Supporting Actress from this film, is probably as good as Judi Dench but has not had the show stopping roles of Dame Judi.  Emily Watson and Kelly Macdonald end up being the most sympathetic figures in the bunch, especially since each becomes, in their own way, the center of the storm.
Finally, director Robert Altman's strength in this film is that he stays out of the way of what is going on.  After an initial shot where we see Lady Constance's maid waiting by the side of the car in the pouring rain for her Ladyship to get into the car first, I do not think there was another specific shot where it was obvious to me that the director was making me see something.  ""Gosford Park"" is an actors's film and that has usually been the primary constant in Altman's film.
This is not a great film (i.e., one I want to watch again and again), but it is a very good film (rare enough in these times).  It may not be your cup of tea, but certainly a film that looks unflinchingly at class distinctions would be well aware that there are two types of people in the world.  This is a hit or miss film that you will either love or it will bore you to death.",1028505600,6,3463,4.257621951219512

Look, there's the once beautiful Alan Bates. Oh, there's Derek Jacobi; why is his part so small? Wait a minute, isn't that Charles Dance from ""A Jewel in the Crown?"" Clive Owens? Didn't he play the ape child of Charles Dance in some Masterpiece Theatre years ago? My oh my isn't that Jeremy Northam charming?

1674428,1,B00005V7CT,"When I watch a movie, I expect to be entertained. Gosford Park did not give me any bit of entertainment whatsoever. The scenery and setting was quite beautiful, and I would say that the acting was good, except that there was no story to act to. This so called ""whodunit"" mystery was hardly a whodunit mystery at all. The extremly thin plot doesn't suggest much motive for any of the characters to commit the murder. And when the mystery is solved, the ending is hardly suprising at all. I will not spoil the ending for anybody who has not yet seen the movie, but I will say one thing - I would've expected the murderer to be someone who had at least a decent amount of screentime. To me, they basically introduced the characters that were involved in the murder for the first time when they reveal the mystery. To make things even worse, the main character seems indifferent when she discovers the whodunit mystery.
I truly do not understand how this movie got nominated for Best Picture by the Academy. I guess it got nominated for the artistic qualities of the movie. If you want to watch a truly artistic movie, watch either The Lord of the Rings or A Beautiful Mind. Gosford Park is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",1028160000,14,1228,4.4622222222222225

1674430,5,B00005V7CT,"'Gosford Park' will, unfortunately, not appeal to everyone.  Some will think it moves too slow, some will think there's not enough action, and some will not want to keep up with all the characters.  That's too bad, but for those who stick with it, 'Gosford Park' will be a wonderful movie experience.
The plot is simple.  In November, 1932, Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) has invited friends and family to his country estate for a hunting weekend.  Everyone arrives with his or her baggage, physical and emotional.  Director Altman expertly allows the viewer to eavesdrop on bits and pieces of seemingly random conversations that serve not so much to give us plot information, but to give us an insight into the characters and their lives.  And to pave the way for murder.
The first half of the film is a brilliant look at the rich and their servants.  The attendants are often treated as part of the furniture.  Often the wealthy guests carry on intimate conversations among themselves with the servants clearly in earshot.  But they are servants, their job is to serve, not to report conversations.  But when the rich are alone with their servants, they confide in them and share information they would never share with anyone else.  Altman does a masterful job of showing us that even though this is an English estate from 70 years past, things really haven't changed much.
Many excellent characters are present in the film.  Sir William seems bored with the charade of hosting this event and seems to want to spend time only with his dog and his mistress.  The feelings are mostly mutual.  His dog seems to be the only one present who really loves him.  Bob Balaban is wonderful as American movie director Morris Weissman, who is more concerned about filming his next Charlie Chan movie than the real-life murder right under his nose.
While all these character revelations are important and fascinating, they do go on perhaps a bit longer than they should.  After all, the film is past the halfway point before the murder is even committed.  But as the film moves closer towards the conclusion, viewers will begin to piece together all the information presented during the first hour to find a solution.  I would almost say that the solution is not as important as the journey getting there, but it is important because of its power.
In watching the film, I almost thought that the movie did not deserve the R rating.  The rating was put there for some language and some very brief [love] situations, but probably to help define the audience.  Kids would probably not enjoy the film at all.  The same could probably be said for action-crazed teenagers.  However, if you enjoy interesting characters portrayed by a stellar cast in the hands of a masterful director, 'Gosford Park' is for you.  Enjoy.

1674434,5,B00005V7CT,"Depending on whom you ask, legendary director Robert Altman is either a fool or a genius.  His fifty year career includes prominence in the early days of TV with his direction of dozens of hit series such as ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", ""Maverick"", and ""Bonanza"".  His filmmaking credits include ""M.A.S.H."" and ""The Player"", both critically acclaimed.  His mercurial style of filmmaking is probably a rebellion from the highly structured approach imposed upon him by early TV.
The direction of his recent films can only be described as chaotic, with a cacophony of actors speaking over one another, and moving hither and yon as the camera sweeps from one side of the room to the other attempting to home in on the dialogue of particular characters.  Altman himself admits that he doesn't even read the script and really isn't concerned with what the actors say, as long as things sound right to him when they come out of their mouths.  He encourages ad-libbing and the more disordered the scene, the better he generally likes it.  Often, this produces utter disasters, like ""Dr. T and the Women"" and ""Gun"".  Sometimes it produces a gem like ""Gosford Park"".
As a murder mystery, Gosford Park is not all that special.  It is fairly predictable with obvious hints dropped at every turn as to who did it and why.  As is the case in most of Altman's recent films, it is difficult to make out a lot of the dialogue with the din on the soundstage of everyone talking at once.  However, what makes this film unique is the treatment of the human dynamic between the aristocracy and the servants.  While lampooning the wealthy by contrasting their behavior with the simple wisdom of commoners is nothing new, never has it been done with such depth and nuance.  Altman's flowing direction of simultaneous events is probably the only way this could have been accomplished so effectively.
The all-star ensemble cast is superlative.  Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam all give fabulous performances upstairs, and Kelly Macdonald, Clive Owen, Helen Mirren, Emily Watson and Alan Bates are marvelous downstairs.  For film lovers who enjoy good acting, this film is paradise.
Genius or fool?  Who knows, maybe both.  However for Robert Altman, this film is clearly a winner.  I rated it 9/10.",1027555200,7,2296,4.922077922077922
1674435,5,B00005V7CT,"I confess to being a Robert Altman fan.  I love most of his work (but not all).  I found this to be a thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable film and I recommend it to people who enjoy non-linear, non-Hollywood films.  This is a dream cast of the best of British actors, going through their paces in a delicious satire/social comedy/mystery delineating in great detail the different lives of the different classes in 1930's England.
This is Upstairs/Downstairs with attitude!  These Downstairs servants are neither in love with or in awe of their social ""betters"" Upstairs.  Far from it!  They find their Lords & Masters for the most part silly, stupid, vain, dull and penny-pinching cheapskates ( especially when it comes to paying their Serving class, at any rate).
We get to observe and contrast the two classes throughout the course of the film:  the Upstairs at play, busily screwing each other both literally and figuratively, while, the Downstairs lot work like the devil to keep these precious Aristos in ease and comfort.  All of this done in typical Altman understatement and casual, almost throwaway observation & dialogue.
I found the period detail wonderful, and the wit droll and precise.  As I said, it is a dream cast of the cream of British acting so everyone is spot-on.
I will admit the dialogue and sound can be difficult to catch, what with the accents and all.  Here's a suggestion: it's a DVD, put on the hearing impaired captions.  I did, so that I wouldn't miss a single bit of dialogue.
And finally, I am glad the murder mystery resolved itself the way it did.  A nice bit of ironic justice, and a nice bit of final revelation of character(s).  I changed my rating from 4 to 5 just to offset all the terrible reviews this film did not merit.  I would give it 4-1/2 actually.

1674437,3,B00005V7CT,"GOSFORD PARK is ostensibly an English country-house murder mystery, but in fact the murder plot is incidental to the film, which is really an examination of class relations in Britain prior to World War II.  And therein lies both the strength and weakness of GOSFORD PARK.
Like most films by Robert Altman, GOSFORD PARK sports a large cast (the film is extremely well-acted) and the camera wanders among overlapping conversations forcing the viewer to piece together what is really happening.  It is hard to follow, and probably only makes sense after multiple viewings.
The particular strength of GOSFORD PARK lies in its recreation of life in an aristocratic country manor.  The screen writer, Julian Fellows was writing out of personal experience, and the filmmakers employed individuals who had once worked in such a house as cook, maid, and butler.  From the mechanics of running such a large household, to the intricacies of the dress code, and the elaborate codes of etiquette, GOSFORD PARK offers a stunning glimpse of a style of life that few of us know first-hand.
The weakness of the film is that it has no heart.  It is meant to be a commentary on the social distance between the classes, even as they lived in close quarters to one another.  But there is this pesky murder plot line, and while the disinterest of everyone in the film as to who actually ""dunit"" may be a commentary on the social mores of the day, the fact that even the protagonist in the end seems almost indifferent when she ""solves"" the crime lends a certain moral dissonance to the project.  Indeed, at the end one is left wondering whether or not she might someday find herself romantically involved with a person who is entirely unrepentant about having stabbed someone in the heart with a knife.
It is impossible to be deeply involved in a film in which there is no moral order at all.  We are simply left watching a large number of people pursuing their interests, with no reason at all to care about what happens to them.",1027296000,13,2009,4.72

Just when you think you know what this film is about, keep watching and think again.

There are a lot of talented English actors...many of whom I have barely heard of nor care to see in another movie.  Everything about this movie is like its predecessor, Clue.  People are invited to a large house, yada yada yada, someone's killed, yada yada, whodunit??
This is the boring, British version of Clue.

1674443,4,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park feels like one of those all-star Agatha Christie mysteries of the seventies and eighties, and one half expects Peter Ustinov to make an appearance at any moment. This is far sharper and more involving, however, than any other films of that genre. As usual, Altman's concentration is on the intriguing characters, and the suspenseful and charged atmosphere stems from observing the interplay between them. The mystery is palpably present from the very beginning; we sense something malevolent looming in the atmosphere, but are watching every move in order to see just how it will be manifest. Every word spoken and action made is laden with potential significance; therein Altman provides the audience with a fascinating and gripping look into a world of believable characters where any moment conflict might erupt into something deadly.
Altman spends most of the film building up to the main crime. Thereafter, everything is brought together convincingly and dramatically. Stephen Fry provides by far the film's most hilarious moments in his turn as a grossly incompetent police inspector.
Part of the film's fascination lies in its period setting, which has a feel of authenticity, and also in the clashing of two worlds, that of servants and masters. The veneer of distance between the two worlds, contrasted with the reality of the complex interrelations between them, lends the film a certain ironic undertone.
This is a film that requires repeated viewings, since there are subtle nuances that may not be noticed the first time around, not to mention such a wealth of characters and situations that one might well miss some of the plot details.",1026864000,,1663,5.162962962962963
1674444,4,B00005V7CT,"Altman's ""Gosford Park"" is a marvellous broad canvas that, in addition to providing a meticulously detailed view of genteel 1930's ""upstairs-downstairs"" living, touches on a variety of other deeper matters (the complex relationships between the gentry and the serving staff, the amusing mutual incomprehension between the British and Americans at the house, the intriguing system of control exerted by the patriarch over other members of the household...)
The plot revolves around a murder in a classic ""the butler did it..."" scenario. However, this melodramatic touch seems almost secondary to Altman's interest in the complex interplay of relationships. The ""whodunnit"" is ultimately resolved (if in a slightly unsatisfying way.)
In all, a wonderful lush (and wry) period piece. Enjoyable to watch, if occasionally confusing and involved. (There are many characters, many quietly spoken asides & a lot of subtle activities on screen -- a second viewing may be required to unravel the many intricacies.)",1026691200,,1004,5.568627450980392
1674445,2,B00005V7CT,"I just rented Gosford Park looking for a ""character movie"" (something like ""State and Main"" or ""Best in Show"").  Unfortunately, Gosford Park doesn't deliver in this category, or any category for that matter.  I'll spare the plot summaries (you can read that in other reviews) and cut to the pros and cons.
Pros:
- The acting is quite good.  The main characters did a great job portraying both high society and life as the servants.
- To complement the acting, the sets and costumes are terrific.  The old mansion and surrounding areas are represented well, leaving the viewer feeling very immersed in the 1930's era.
Cons:
- The story really drags most of the time.  There are a lot of characters, and the movie take time to try and build up a motive for each one.  However, this results in a lot of slow, uninteresting moments.  Additionally, I felt that too many characters were focused on.  The end result is confusion, and I spent a lot of time trying to tell characters apart.  This is not good, as I think we, as viewers, were supposed be intrigued by the possible suspects and be startled by the ending (obviously didn't happen for me).
- The character development wasn't helped at all by the awful sound.  As mentioned in other reviews, it is VERY hard to hear what the characters are saying.  Although I like the *idea* of the viewer sort of drifting from conversation to conversation, it was not well executed in this movie.  Instead I spent most of the time trying to make out anything intelligible from the jumble of phrases being thrown at our ears.
There are plenty of other things I could drivel about, but I think (a) a boring, slow plot and (b) unintelligible voices should be enough to convey my general disliking of the movie.
We didn't play with the DVD itself much itself.  The previews included on the DVD were very old (I don't remember the specific movies), but I don't care much for previews, so that didn't bother me.  One odd thing occurred when we first tried ""Play Movie.""  The movie started, but without sound.  We had to use the scene selector and go to the first scene to get any sound (although I'm sure this is only a problem because we had a rental DVD).
The bottom line: I really can't think of any reason to see this movie, let alone own the DVD.  The plot is slow and the characters indistinguishable.",1026691200,8,2339,4.544152744630072
1674446,3,B00005V7CT,"Well, Altman is one of my favorite directors.  I've enjoyed the big hits(Mash, The Player, Nashville) as well as the little ones (Streamers, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, 3 Women).  When I saw all the praise I was expecting an excellent film, this isn't it.
First of all, there's the dreaded patented Altman sound mix that has worked well elsewhere (especially in Mash where it accentuated the sense of chaos), that is a disaster here.  Trying to make out what these folks are saying just gets in the way of enjoying and understanding the film.  The movie is overly long, it takes too long to get to the murder, I didn't care about the guy who died, and I didn't get that longing to figure out who killed him (this kills the who-done-it).  The interwoven character studies that works so well in Nashville and Short-cuts doesn't work here as it simply meant there were more characters I really didn't care about.  Beautifully filmed? yes!  That's the only reason I can even give it 3 stars.  I had heard how this film takes you beneath the surface of intricate relationships between characters (something Altman can do quite well).  Ok, this person is sleeping with this person, and that guy doesn't love his wife, and this lady really runs the show, etc.,...  The problem is the film builds no real feelings for any of them.

1674447,1,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park seemed like the type of movie that I would really enjoy. A murder mystery set in the 1930's. Kind of like Clue but with a bigger budget and less comedy. Unfortunately, I found myself falling asleep because I had no clue what was going on. I honestly know no more about the movie now than I did before I watched it. If you were to ask me what the movie was about, I would say some people came to a big house, someone was murdered, the people left. And you do not have to worry about me spoiling the ending because I do not know who the killer was. I understood that several characters had motives, but I did not understand why. I am not sure if the murderer was revealed or if he or she was not intended to be revealed.
Here were my main difficulties with the movie. First, most of the characters had thick British accents and the sound was not done well at all. There was always too much background noise. Therefore, even if I could hear the dialogue, I could not understand it. Second, there were too many characters and the movie kept jumping from one to another very quickly, so I had no idea who was who and how they were related to the other characters.
These difficulties left me watching the end credits rolling with disbelief. The movie just seemed to end, leaving no closure. I can only assume that this is the type of movie that you need to watch at least a couple of times in order to completely understand it. I rented this movie so I really do not have much motivation to spend the time or the money to watch it again.",1026518400,12,1544,4.237288135593221
1674448,1,B00005V7CT,"This is normally the kind of film that I really enjoy. I read all the positive reviews from the critics, and so when it came out on DVD, I rushed out to buy it. I really wanted to like this film, but I can't even believe that the reviewers who gave this film a postive review and I even saw the same film.
First, and most damaging, was the sound mix on this film. The dialogue was so unintelligable and muddled that I had to turn on the closed captioning just to understand the dialogue. There was so much background noise interfering with the dialogue, and so much dialogue that overlapped with other dialogue, I couldn't understand a word that was being said. At the beginning, I kept turning up the volume on the tv because I thought it was my sense of hearing. It wasn't until the tv volume was almost all the way up that I realized that it was the film, not my hearing. By that time, I'd missed a huge portion of the dialogue that set up various critical character interactions and plot points, and I didn't even care enough to go back and re-view it to see what I'd missed. It was horrible!
Secondly, the characters were so flat and indistinguishable that I still don't know who was who, or even the character's names! If I spend 2 hours with a set of movie characters, I'd at least like to know who they are by the end of the film, and why they're doing what they're doing. Still have no clue who most of the characters were, or why I should care about them.
Some of the actors were fabulous, but expecting Maggie Smith, Jeremy Northam, and Emily Watson to carry a film of this length and complication by themselves is ludicrous. Ryan Phillipe's acting was horrible and Derek Jacobi was utterly wasted. I plan to sell this DVD as soon as I can, and clear some room in my DVD rack for a better film.",1026345600,34,1805,4.296187683284457
1674449,4,B00005V7CT,"Directed by Robert Altman, this film take place in the English country side of the 1930s at the lavish and beautiful estate known as Gosford Park. Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) and his wife, Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas) host a large, weekend hunting party for a distinguished assemblage of guests, who arrive accompanied by their downstairs entourage.
It soon becomes clear that the film revolves around a hodge podge of subplots and intrigues, both upstairs and downstairs, some of which are quite interesting, others seemingly less so. They all become pertinent, however, when one of them is murdered by someone in their midst. The film plays as if it were a more upscale and lavish version of the PBS series ""Mystery"" or as a film based upon an Agatha Christie mystery.
The cast is stellar with excellent performances by all. Maggie Smith is outstanding in the role of Constance Trentham, a snobby, self-absorbed, old biddy in need of money, so that she can continue the lifestyle to which she is accustomed. Jeremy Northam is wonderful playing matinee idol, Ivor Novello, and continues to extend his range, as this role requires him to sing, which he does quite credibly, in fact.
Helen Mirren and Eileen Atkins are superlative as the  housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson, and the cook, Mrs. Croft, who are, apparently, at war with each other.  Richard E, Grant, Alan Bates, Derek Jacobi, Emily Watson, and Kelly MacDonald are wonderful as part of the core of downstairs folks through whose eyes the viewer see events unfold.
Stephen Fry deserves mention for his brief, though memorable, turn as the laid back Inspector Thompson, whose bumbling investigative efforts seem almost sure to leave the murder unsolved. The audience, however, knows who did it by film's end, even though Inspector Thompson appears not to have a clue.
The cinematography is beautiful, as it captures the sumpuousness and richness of the upstairs life in the manor home. It also captures the bleakness and confinement of downstairs life, as well, serving to further underline the great divide that exists between the two. The gulf is further delineated by one of the subplots, which sees the character played by Ryan Phillippe gamely straddle both worlds.
The one small problem I found with the film is that,  because there are so many characters with their own subplots and intrigues, the film is somewhat confusing at times. Moreover, some of the dialogue is occasionally unintelligible and garbled, due to overlapping dialogue, which was a bit annoying. Watching the DVD with the English subtitles feature on, however, would probably resolve this issue.
The DVD offers a number of interesting features, including an enjoyable mini- ducumentary of Altman's efforts to ensure authenticity of period detail. They apparently hired a cook, a butler, and a maid who were in service during the early nineteen thirties as a sort of sounding board as to how things were done. It also features two commentaries, as well as a short on the making of Gosford Park. It is a value packed DVD and well worth the money. Viewers who like period pieces and mysteries will especially enjoy it.",1026345600,15,3153,5.024856596558317
1674450,3,B00005V7CT,"Period pieces are not everybody's thing.  I know grown men who would gladly eat glass rather than sit through one.  And really, can you blame them?  Costume dramas are almost always boringly similar.  People wear fancy clothes, sip tea, become attracted to people they shouldn't become attracted to, and say things like, ""I love Lord Fibberbush, but he's not of my class!  Oh, the pain!"".  If you're a historian, it's usually fun.  If you're a normal person, it's usually agony.
So it's pleasing to report that Robert Altman's Gosford Park is a refreshingly entertaining period piece, filled with snappy dialogue (when you can follow it), murder, sex, and an attractive, if not downright exhaustive, cast.  It's also refreshing to see that the notion of servants having more integrity than the people they serve has been debunked here.  Here, both upstairs and downstairs feature characters who lie, gossip, and backstab.  Altman's direction, as always, make you feel like a voyeur, like you're watching something you're not supposed to.  And that's the fun - you're peeking in on one nasty cocktail party, which is always amusing.
But, this being Altman, it's an acquired taste.  His overlapping dialogue and low sound mix combine with a broad range of dialects to make viewers strain to hear everything.  You're not supposed to hear everything, of course, but not everyone will know that, and it could be annoying after a while.  The film is also a bit of a puff piece.  It doesn't say anything particularly new about class struggles back in 1930's England, then again it doesn't try.  The reason Gosford Park feels like more than what is actually is is more a tribute to the cast, particularly Helen Mirren, Maggie Smith (who could do her part in her sleep), Michael Gambon, and Clive Owen.  Owen, in particular, has ""movie star"" written all over him.  He has a presence that trumps everyone else on screen, and it should serve him well if, as rumored, he becomes the next James Bond.
Overall, Gosford Park is a nice, airy entertainment brought to a higher level by the skill of its stars and its director.  It makes for a nice evening diversion.  That is, if you haven't got any fox hunts scheduled.",1026172800,6,2203,4.839572192513369
1674451,4,B00005V7CT,"True I did rent this DVD thinking it would be like the classic ""CLUE"" movie, but it wasn't. Like someone mentioned earlier the murder doesn't happen until the latter part of the film and I still am not sure who is who in the movie, but I enjoyed it enough to say I will have to rent it again and maybe put on the sub-titles so I can understand more.
They don't make movies like this anymore the wrap-up of the murder at the end happened without a build-up, In My Opinion and the rest of the movie just flows from there. That left me feeling like I missed something. Hmph bottom line is it was a good flick worth the time and money, good performances by all. Loved Emily Watson, Maggie Smith and Jeremy Northam.

1674452,5,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park is more than a murder mystery.  In fact the murder is incidental to the story.  It's about two classes of people.  The servants and the served, two groups at the opposite extremes of social acceptance.
Altman does a great job of showing how intertwined and dependant they are on each other.  The rich are often snobbish, self-absorbed and just plain mean.  But not always.  The servants are full of gossip about their employers, simpler (that might be arguable) and kinder.  But again, not always.
Pride and lust, money and vengence and a lot petty squabbles end up being greatly entertaining.  Not in a soap opera fashion, but rather at sociological study of inter-relationships between classes.
For me, the best moment is when the ""film star"" plays and sings at the piano with the aristocats who are bored with it while in the shadows of the hallways and staircases the servants are captivated by his music.  The cynical seen-it-all-before attitudes of the upper classes contrasted with the star-crossed servants who are willing to let themselves be entertained without constraints.
I liked Altman's ""The Player"" as a comment on Hollywood and in a similar fashion, Gosford Park is his comment on class and society in England.  Highly recommended.",1026086400,4,1261,5.019230769230769

""Gosford Park"" has too many people whose identities get lost in this myriad of affluence.  Yes, the cast is great (hence the 2 star rating) but it's hard to tell who's who, no less than whodunit.

I don't watch professional wrestling, reality television, or NASCAR. I hate Bruce Willis action movies. I comprehend all dialects of English (except ebonics) with little trouble, and my hearing is acute. However, this pretentious waste of film from the overrated Altman is a seemingly endless, shallow tale of a herd of useless, uninteresting rich people drinking tea and wearing clothes while a regiment of bitter, whining servants runs up and down stairs catering to their petty demands. As if this weren't soporific enough, it is a struggle to understand more than about one out of five words. The presence of British, Irish, and Scottish accents is complicated by overlapping dialogue, echoing rooms, lots of mumbling and whispering, and poor recording. There's just no excuse for this. Whether it was intentional on Altman's part or not, it's shoddy film making. After about an hour, I turned on the subtitles for the deaf, which solved that particular problem. Unfortunately, by then I just didn't really care any more. This movie is not ""subtle"", it's just pointless. Altman has made a lot of horrid junk (particularly the dreadful Nashville), and Gosford Park can be added to the list. If you feel you must see it, be sure to turn on the subtitles from the beginning.",1025740800,15,1389,4.94017094017094

The nuances of each actor makes you want to watch this film many times, so you don't miss anything!  The production design and costumes are top notch, and Robert Altman once again lets his actors become the characters. And anyway, I love period films!

1674457,3,B00005V7CT,"Opinions are sharply divided in this film, and I can see why.  First of all I have to say that it was very unfortunate that it was marketed as a murder mystery because it isn't.  Sure, there's a murder, but that's treated as hardly important at all.  So if you want murder in the 1930s, read Agatha Christie.
Secondly, maybe I'm just dumb, but I could hardly keep track of all the characters, especially the upper-class ones (was this meant to be an ironic comment or something?  How all the upper-class people are vapid conformists?)  There were too many brown-haired rich women and too many men in suits and it just got really confusing.  For this reason, I didn't really enjoy the upper-class scenes because I couldn't work out how people related to each other or why they were saying things or...or anything.
The working-class scenes were much better and are the main reason why I'm giving this movie 3 stars.  It really brought home to me how unfair the class system was and the contrast between the lives of the servants and their employers.
This movie could have used some cutting.  I'm sorry, but it could.  No matter how interesting characters are (and these weren't THAT interesting) you can't expect everything they do to be interesting.  Any scene they have should advance the story.  That was my main problem with this movie - I like something where plot is considered as well as character.
I was sickened to see all the reviews here which act patronising and say 'oh, if you didn't like this movie you're a dumb brainless hick who only wants explosions and sex.'  I resent that implication!  Just because someone doesn't like the same things you do does not mean they are stupid - honestly, that's the sort of thing you teach little children.
Anyway, if you REALLY like things set in the 1930s, or if you're interested in class differences, or if you don't like fast-paced films, Gosford Park may be for you.  Just don't see it for the mystery.  Really, really don't.",1025654400,8,1981,4.652298850574713
1674458,5,B00005V7CT,"The master collaborator Robert Altman probably doesn't mind, but Julian Fellowes has done it again. The first-time film screenwriter, who walked away with ""Gosford Park's"" only Oscar in March, deftly steals the show with his commentary on the DVD version of the film. Fellowes is deeply knowledgeable about the English upper class's old traditions and serves as an entertaining guide into their curious world as it was in the 1930s -- the era depicted in ""Gosford."" Hardly pausing for a breath or needing to collect his thoughts, the British writer-actor delivers one of the best DVD commentaries to date.
Altman, who appears on a separate commentary track, has his moments as well. The secret to his success? Altman gathers a great cast and then waits for them to make on-camera mistakes, thus hitting ""that truth button."" Altman, amiable and alert, speaks in the tones of an expert witness at a malpractice trial. He's nudged along by his son, production designer Stephen Altman, and producer David Levy (both unidentified until the commentary is over). In a 20-minute section of deleted footage, Altman confidently gives the merits of each scene and then dismisses them (even Maggie Smith feels his ax).
The DVD comes in widescreen only, helping viewers track the comings and goings of Altman's 40 or so players. The picture looks OK; a bit soft and dark in places. The aspect ratio is about 2.27:1 with the 16x9 monitor enhancement. The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound adds unexpected life to the proceedings, delivering great atmospherics.

1674459,5,B00005V7CT,"I really enjoyed _Gosford Park_, a period, costume drama something in the mold of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians. A group of upper-class British society types and their hangers-on gather at a country estate for a weekend of shooting. During the course of the weekend, the lord of the manor is killed and a rather bumbling detective comes in to investigate the crime.
Sounds like something you've seen before, doesn't it? Well, the brilliance of the film comes in the fact that the story focuses on the various servants--valets, cooks, butlers, etc.--who make up the ""below stairs"" society in the house. We see those above stairs through their eyes, as well as the comings and goings related to the murder investigation. The actual murder isn't really solved per se, though we know who did it by film's end. What really matters are the interactions between people and the exploration of this little-seen society, in which social hierarchy is just as important, if not more so, than in the above stairs world.
The DVD has some excellent extras--an extended sequence of deleted scenes, with insightful commentary regarding why they were cut; an interesting behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the film; a brief look at the accuracy of the film--they actually tracked down a head cook, a butler, and a ladies' serving maid who acted as consultants to make sure the actors were realistic; and a great question and answer sequence that catches several of the cast and crew following a special screening of the film. It's obvious that all involved were having a great time making this movie, and that infectious spirit of fun comes through quite vividly.",1025568000,9,1664,4.989208633093525

1674461,4,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman always weaves more characters in and out of a story than most directors could handle in a decade.  He is the master at this; and his films have a look all their own.  The acting in this picture is stellar.  Many have lauded Maggie Smith, but she still makes me laugh when applause is given of a musical number and she says, ""Oh don't encourage him.""  Then to see her cackle when Ryan Phillipe gets tea poured in his crotch is a sheer pleasure.  Cindy Wilson is again marvelous with a multi-layered performance.  Helen Mirren's controlled performance is breathtaking.  Even Bob Balaban as the perverse Hollywood director is flits about wonderfully.
The DVD version offers a tremendous amount of bonus material.  It shows a lot about how Altman works to see the scenes that were edited out, and there are a great many.  I particularly enjoyed the one where Jennings (Alan Bates), the oh so proper butler, is pouring wine into a bottle, tastes it appreciately, and then knocks over the bottle accidentally and cracks up as the scene is cut.  It's a great little moment to enjoy.
This film is a bit a slow, but we can't always be in a hurry, now, can we?  I enjoyed it in the theatre, and think the DVD version enhances the movie experience immensely.",1025568000,8,1261,4.584821428571429

It's about class interaction, and just happens to have a who-done-it in the middle.  The mystery is really not the point of the story, nor is it important ""who"" the who-done-it really is.  The showcase of the film is around two completely separate groups of people existing in one house:  one living in it, and one making it all work.  Beautiful costumes, beautiful scenery, and excellent acting make this a fun movie to watch more than once.

But Maggie Smith  really makes the movie, with her quiet little insults and her gentle scene-stealing.
The movie is as much about the servants in Gosford Park as about the well-to-do characters who pretend to deserve our attention more. Director Robert Altman brilliantly plays the two sets of characters off each other, toying with their similarities without ignoring the class differences and injustices that keep them apart. Those similarities first become obvious when one of the new arrivals learns that she will be known not by her own name but by the name of the woman she serves.
I wouldn't call this a great comedy, or a great mystery, though it strives to be both. Still, I would call it a great showcase of brilliant acting and clever one-liners. The 1930s period costumes and the character studies make it even more enchanting.",1025568000,4,1178,4.919597989949748

There are some easily missed subtlties (some of the dialog is hard to catch) which enrich the story.  It is also easier to get into the story when you know the relationships between the characters, which may not be 100% clear on first viewing.

1674465,3,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman must have woke up one morning and turned the tv to public television. On the tv there may have been a little show known as ""Mystery"" or ""Poirot"". As he sat there staring into the tube, enjoying the show, he probably said something like this: ""I wanna make one of those."" And thus, ""Gosford Park"" was born.
Of course there were other inspirations for Gosford Park, probably an entire list of them, but it felt like a late night episode of ""Father Cadfiel"". Not that that's bad, but if a decent murder mystery / cast rich film can recieve awards, shouldn't we consider the lesser? Gosford Park is a good movie, a really good one. But, If you don't have interest in period films, or have problem's with quick, overlapping and sometimes unintelligable dialogue (sub-t are helpful) then don't see it. The British accent's neither help nor hinder the problem.
(If you have a surround sound set-up, listen out for the cigarette effect that takes place in left speaker, when the inspector first goes into the kitchen with the servants. It is a nice touch.)
Maggie Smith is always good in whatever she does, and transend's what could have been a drab character creating some nifty moments. You can tell she had fun with the material. The most interesting character was the Inspector, who's detatched effort's made me sit up in my seat. His performance reminded me of something Orson Welles would do if he were living today in his prime. Ryan Phillippe seemed out of place, but its good to see that he's branching out of the ""Teen flick"" category, and took a great step by participating. Freddy Prinze should follow his example (unfortunately he has been tackled to continue in the next two Scooby-poo sequels).
As a fan of period film's, I liked Gosford Park, but if I were just an everyday movie goer who had low tolerance for quick dialogue and spent my life avoiding shows like ""Mystery"", then you may want to miss it. ~s.a.o.s.~",1025481600,,1937,4.683284457478006

But I'm not prejudice to Robert Altman films. I gave this one a chance. It has no characters I care about, an ending that just seems like they ran out of money so they had to stop, and a plot shamelessly ripped off of the far superior ""CLUE"". The story involves a huge group of people going to a large country mansion for a shooting party. One of them is a producer for the 30's and 40's ""Charlie Chan"" mystery films, who's next film ""CHARLIE CHAN IN LONDON"" begins to mysteriously come to life as one of the guests is both poisioned and stabbed.
So, whodunnit? Well, we don't exactly find out, so it doesn't particularly matter who did it.
Another thing I don't like about this movie is all the meaningless scenes. The film could have been cut down to an hour and a half if they could have spared ten or twenty meaningless conversations like ""This tea is cold, could I have another one...? No! Not in that glass! You're not even Scottish!""
Not to mention that in ""CLUE"", you couldn't tell if the killer was male or female, leaving us guessing. But in ""GOSFORD PARK"", we not only see that the killer is a man, but that he's also wearing pen-striped pants! A trait that only belongs to one person in the whole movie!!!
In closing, if you're intrested in the way Europeans lived their lives during the 30's, or would like to see nice scenery (which this film does have quite a bit of), go out and see this film. However, if you want a good murder mystery flick, do yourself a favor and just watch ""CLUE"".",1025481600,8,1758,4.343465045592705

1674468,5,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman began his career over fifty years ago in television, directing episodes of early popular shows like ""Route 66"" and Maverick"". Who'd have thought he would go on to direct some of the most interesting movies ever made, or that at the beginning of the 21st Century, he'd still be going strong? Like anyone whose career has spanned more than half a century, he has had his peaks and valleys. Movies like ""M.A.S.H."" and ""Nashville"" made him famous in the early 1970s. For the next two decades his work was so hit and miss that some thought he'd lost his touch, but he came roaring back in the 1990s with pictures like ""The Player"" and Short Cuts"". Now comes ""Gosford Park"", one of his best works ever.
The English countryside, 1932. Sir William McCordle [Michael Gambon] and his wife, Lady Sylvia [Kristin Scott Thomas] have invited a dozen guests for the weekend. They arrive with their servants, who disappear downstairs while their employers go up to the lavish suites and drawing rooms of Gosford Park House. While the grand ladies and gentlemen are doing their best to impress and entertain each other, the servants are busy seeing to it that everything runs smoothly. The intrigue and gossip downstairs is at least as complex and interesting as it is upstairs. Class and tradition may separate the two groups, but, as the story moves along, we see that they are actually connected in all sorts of ways. Everything runs smoothly until someone [or perhaps more than one] rudely kills the host.... Twice!
After the murder, the plot gets a little murky, but most viewers will be having too much fun to care. Altman movies are rarely about story. They are about the characters. His genius lies in his ability to take a script with many speaking parts and make all of the characters distinct and memorable. Most directors can't handle more than six or seven  characters. ""Gosford Park"" has over thirty.
The legendary Maggie Smith is a real scene-stealer as the shrewd, witty and acerbic Constance, Sir William's not-so-devoted sister. Ms. Smith can make you laugh just by twitching her lip or raising an eyebrow. Helen Mirren plays Mrs. Wilson, head housekeeper of Gosford Park. She knows everyone's secrets. Stephen Fry is Inspector Thompson, who is more interested in the trappings of his job than he is in actually finding out who killed Sir William, while Alan Bates is Jennings, the head butler who knows he's at the top of his profession. The list of players goes on and on. Some roles are larger than others are, but none of the actors seems to mind. They say that working with Altman is a joy.
""Gosford Park"", by the way, is a comedy. It has a lot to say about class structure and the way people interact with one another. It shows how people often say one thing and mean another or use words as verbal swords. But Altman never preaches. He's one of life's keenest observers. It's a joy to share his observations.",1025308800,4,2930,4.72265625
1674469,3,B00005V7CT,"What violence is to the action/adventure film(this film is NOT that at all), dialogue is to Robert Altman's latest work, ""Gosford Park"".
Like other films by Altman, this one has it's different stories giong on at once, and a huge cast, mostly made up of unknowns.
Maggie Smith, Kristen Scott Thomas, and Jeremy Northam(played Mr. Big on Sex and the City) are the well knowns who play among the aristocrats.  Emily Watson, Helen Mirren, Alan Bates, and Ryan Phillippe are among the well knowns of the servants of the aristocrats.  The strongest performances are by Smith and Mirren, who were both nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Oscars. Maggie Smith was far more deservant of the Oscar than the winner, Jennifer Connolly.  Smith was great as the sarcastic, tactless, snob who has nothing good to say about anyone at all.
The story:  Lady Sylvia McCordle(Scott Thomas) and her husband, William are hosting a shooting party. The party consists of everyone sitting around talking and eating and drinking the night before the actual shooting of birds commences.  They invite family and friends of society.  Everyone brings their own servant.  It reminded a little of ""Murder by Death"", but it was really that funny at all.  It had it's little momments, but this is mostly a dramatic film with a plot twist of murder added to the Altman mix.  It shows the different world and goings on of both the ""aristrocrats"" and their ""servants"".
The acting was very well done by the entire cast. I can see that Robert Altman is trying something new here to some extent, and he did a good job. This is a decent film, but It is not one of my faves of 2001.  I thought it was far too slow, and it seemed to drag on forever.  This is long!!! Be prepared for that.

It's really more of a ""whydunit?"" than a ""whodunit?"" The ensemble cast is flawless--in fact, there are so many perfect perfomances that it would be unfair to single one out. Suffice it to say that Robert Altman is the greatest living ""actor's director."" And for a ""cynical, old ironist,"" he also gives us one of the most deeply felt endings in recent cinema, one that brings the entire 2 hour and 18 min. film into poignantly sharp focus.

It is not primarily a mystery, and people who go to see a Poirot or Marple will naturally be disappointed.  A huge ensemble of very talented stars were paid a pittance (by Hollywood standards) to work with Altman. The mystery is only a small part of the film; the characterizations and the evocation of the zeitgeist of the era are most of it.  The word ""ensemble"" is important here: there is no preeminent star stealing the show: it a a bunch of good actors, working together in gorgeous settings, under good direction.  Maggie Smith is brilliant (if a tiny bit reminiscent of Professor McGonagle).  I have been surprised that the film has not caused a resurgence of interest in the music of Ivor Novello, played wonderfully by Jeremy Northam.

You may want to keep this in mind when considering my opinion:  I didn't pick this movie up--a friend brought it over, as it is not something I would bother with on my own to begin with.

1674479,4,B00005V7CT,"Gosford Park begins with a murder of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) in his library after a shooting party. The suspects run from the upper class strata in his estate including Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife, Jeremy Northam as a silver-screen idol, Maggie Smith as a snobbish countess and a dozen more - along with a huge cluster of maids, footmen and cooks played by the talents of Emily Watson, Kelly MacDonald, Ryan Phillippe et al under the supervision of housekeeper Helen Mirren and majordomo Alan Bates.
For fans who crave an intelligent whodunit judging that Gosford Park is Jean Renoir's classic Rules of the Game written by sleuth writers Agatha Christie and Evelyn Waugh will be disappointed. It is precisely a smokescreen to dramatize and mock the British hierachy when the Empire was crumbling in 1932 under financial doldrums and servants pressing for freedom.
It is with Altman's mastery in his sweeping visuals that roam and spy amongst the upstairs-downstairs that makes Gosford Park dazzling in its scope of parodying - where you watch the snobs ostracize and the servants fornicate and gossip with deceit - and clinches him a Golden Globe Award for best director. He prudently trains his eye on the talented ensemble that comprises of British screen goddess and Hollywood stars who together, delivers top-notch performances particularly the restraint of Helen Mirren and the dry sardonic Maggie Smith. Julian Fellowes's screenplay which pocketed the Academy Award packs the merits up together to invite audiences to a wicked comedy of manners and class that you never thought could materialize in its scale and supremacy.",1024790400,4,1648,5.152985074626866

The only thing you've heard about which really happens is - THE MURDER.
In spite of all that - this is one of the MOST breath taking movies you can hope for in the last years. R-Altman is a brain of our times - this is what makes thrill out of the project that made me watch until the last end titles. The air of the movie is UNBEATEN! Gosford Park is one of the art pieces - just like Shakespeare's plays - nobody would go for a Macbeth or Romeo and Julia to find out who is the murderer - you watch them to get in the mood of the play for a couple of minutes.

1674482,5,B00005V7CT,"I am a fan of Altman's work, so going into the film ""Gosford Park,"" if nothing else, I expected to be entertained.  Much to my surprise, not only was this a funny look at class structure in the 30s, but this is Altman's best film since MASH, which he made more than 30 YEARS AGO.  Altman seems to be getting better with age.  In my opinion, Altman and not Howard should have won an Oscar last year, let alone two.  If he had it wouldn't have necessarily been a career award even though it probably would have viewed that way.  This film was THE BEST FILM of 2001.
  I have always respected Altman for doing challenging, and interesting projects, but not necessarily box office friendly ones.  This was, however, one of the rare cases in which a few people went to see a good movie in the theater.  The success of the film is due to the impeccable acting in the film, a credit to Altman and the talented cast, which includes: Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Clive Owen, Michael Gambon, and Emily Watson just to name a few.  But I am forgetting to mention the outstanding Oscar winning script, by first-time writer Julian Fellowes, based on an idea by Altman and Bob Balaban, who oddly enough has become one of my favorite actors.  Balaban was in my two favorite movies last year, ""Gosford Park"" and ""Ghost World.""
  Altman is one of my favorite directors of all time because he is a talented man who takes on interesting subject matter, and injects it with a visual style that is very unique.  The opening shot of ""Gosford Park"" is impressive, in that it is a continous shot introducing all of these great characters within this one setting.  Most of film takes place at a large mansion.  The fluid camera movement through the mansion catching these characters in the middle of their conversations in the very beginning of the film set the tone of the film very well.  This is a technique he used, to great effect, in ""The Player.""",1023062400,10,1926,4.504322766570605

servants dwell affording the viewer discoveries of the

wrenching final scene when the biggest secret of all is revealed. The novice film viewer easily pleased by Hollywood's

1674486,3,B00005V7CT,"Robert Altman's Gosford park is a charming and very well-donw attempt to make a period Edwardian Country House Murder-Mystery
drama, given the fact that he's American. While Altman has paid an enormous amount of detail to the intricacies of Edwardian social etiquette, it's a shame he didn't pay so much attention to the plot.
It's your usual whodunnit drama. The trouble is, it's been done hundreds of times before, albeit in cheaper TV and film versions of Agatha Christie novels. The first hour or so is devoted to setting up the characters both upstairs and downstairs and Altman takes great pleasure in showing off the great ensemble cast (which includes almost every british actor of note over 30 worth their salt). When the murder is committed, the usual cliches are rolled out: Stephen Fry's bumbling performance as a detective is so bad its almost good but ultimately too unrealistic and the usual downstairs speculation begins. even the line ""Maybe the butler did it"" is uttered by the detective's assistant. Fry's detective doesn't solve the murder or provide any insight into at all and, after just one visit to the house, leaves the film, never to be seen again. His presence appears to be there just to laugh at the British police system and provide the token bumbling detective role in a murder-mystery movie.
The solution to the murder is a nice twist, but it's impact is wasted as all the truth comes out in the last fifteen to twenty minutes of the film, leaving us no time to contemplate how it affects the staff.
Overall verdict: The period details are nice and the Edwardian social comedy aspect is very good, but as a murder-mystery film, this film would fall before the first hurdle because of it's complete unbelievability.",1020816000,2,1747,4.865771812080537
1674487,5,B00005V7CT,"Since the DVD has not yet been released, this is a review of the movie.
I was skeptical about this movie -- Robert Altman films can be difficult.  But he has scored big with this one.  The cast is perfect -- don't we all see Maggie Smith as English upper crust?
Don't get me wrong -- you have to pay close attention.  Like most Altman films, there is a lot going on -- certainly more than one plot with people talking over each other (just like in real life).  At it's very basic level, this is a murder mystery, and the scenes with the detective were hilarious.
Bottom line -- if you like your comedy spoon fed (this really isn't an insult, just that some people don't want to work when they see a movie), then you probably won't enjoy this.  If you like intelligent movies with sophisticated (and some base) humor, with twists and turns and multiple plots, this is the movie for you.
I can't wait for the DVD release!",1020816000,,919,4.319767441860465
1674488,4,B00005V7CT,"""Gosford Park"" (2001)
I was very excited about this motion picture. Not only had it received 9 BAFTA nominations, 7 Academy Award nominations and 1 Oscar to take home, but if you take a look at its cast (which includes Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Michael Gambon, Bob Balaban and many other very famous actors) and director (highly acclaimed Robert Altman) you'll also see why. I liked this movie but I do not think it is Oscar material. It had its share of great points and not-so-great ones, but was still a very credible piece of filmmaking.
Altman won a Golden Globe statuette for his directing efforts in Gosford Park and proved to me he still has the magic touch that many directors lose when they get to his age (he is an amazing 77 years old and still going strong). He conducts his gigantic cast magnificently, pulling excellent performances out of each. The film also has great execution and terrific atmosphere, which is mostly thanks to his strong enthusiasm and quality directing.
The baffling cast is one of the strongest ensembles of 2001. Most of the attention has gone to actresses Helen Mirren and Maggie Smith, who were very plausible in their difficult roles (not that they are that difficult for these wonderful female actors). However, I thought they were both surprisingly underused. Mirren pops in and out of the camera shots for most of the film but her acting at the end of the film is marvellous. Smith is funny but I wanted to see more of her.
I thought that some of the other actors in the film like Kristin Scott Thomas (always brilliant), Ryan Phillipe (who surprised me with a stunning accent and performance - his first real breakthrough to adult films), Emily Watson (terrific yet again) and especially Kelly MacDonald who is the anchor of the film. Credit must also go to Stephen Fry and Michael Gambon who look a lot alike and both give hugely enjoyable performances in minor roles.
The setting of this film is one of the best I've seen in a while. What could possibly be better than a grand old house to be the centrepiece of a stylish film reminiscent of an Agatha Christie whodunit story? Very cool. Most of the movie is inside and I think there were about 3 scenes that were held outside of the terrific house. Altman is good with this setting though, he gives us like a grand tour of the house and I eventually got to know where the servants lived and bathed, and where the upper-class guests stayed.
I think there were a couple of things that had me a little displeased and slightly disappointed about Gosford Park. There are no particularly memorable sequences or scenes in the film. What annoyed me is that I couldn't look back on the film after leaving the theatre and say ""oh, that part was the best"" or ""that part I will remember for a long time"". It was forgettable and sometimes boring. The baffling mystery kept me guessing (I got the guess right, but no the motive) because the killer in the movie could be anyone. The climax of the movie was sort of really unsuspenseful and disappointing, I was saying to myself ""is that it?!""
All in all Gosford Park movie worked. It had a great script to work with that included terrific character development and brilliantly written dialogue. However, I got uninterested too often and I think a couple of scenes could've been chopped off. Some of the stories in the film were just tedious. I don't Gosford Park deserved so much BAFTA or Oscar attention, but it was original and well-done enough and I enjoyed myself.

1674489,5,B00005V7CT,"Before I saw Gosford Park, many people kept telling me how complicated it got and that it was simply impossible to follow. I walked into the theater promising myself I would not be confused or at all dazed by this movie...I found it not to be a difficult goal to set. This movie had a large cast of characters, but was beautifully set up, leaving us with clear-cut suspects, reasons and times in which they would have killed the victim. But the murder is not even the beginning of the intricate plot, there are relationships between people that appear to be one thing, but turn to be totally different. As the truth was slowly revealed to us audience members, there was more than one *gasp*. The best kind of mystery, is that which sets things up so well and clearly that theoretically you could figure it out on your own, but don't until they want you to. Gosford Park is by far one of the best movies of 2001, and one of the most enjoyable murder mysteries I have seen.

Fortunately, 99% of feature films on Bluray disc look infinitely better than this mess does.

7956134,3,B00005V7CT,"Superficially, Gosford Park, with its typically Altman-esque ensemble cast, is inspired by Jean Renoir's 1939 masterpiece The Rules of the Game. Both movies explore the goings-on below and above stairs during a country house shooting party in the 1930s. But while Rules of the Game was a biting social commentary on the moral decay of the ruling classes that was ultimately banned by both the French government and the Nazis, Gosford Park is little more than a murder mystery and whodunit in the mold of Agatha Christie. The afternoon of senseless game shooting that turns into a slaughter in the French movie (and that shocked even the French audiences of the time) contrasts with the pheasant hunt in Gosford Park that is little more than a comic device to ridicule the local squire. Written by Julian Fellowes of Downton Abbey fame, Gosford Park movie is only slightly less gauzy in its treatment of the master-servant relationships than the TV series was. Happily, all the good lines in both productions are reserved for Maggie Smith who plays an acerbic countess living in genteel poverty and who looks down on movie stars and self-made millionaires with equal pleasure. Other good performances are turned in by Kristen Scott Thomas, Eilleen Atkins and Helen Mirren. The performances by the movie's creator Bob Balaban and a laughable Ryan Phillipe are merely annoying.
