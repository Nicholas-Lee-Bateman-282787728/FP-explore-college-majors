3427643,5,B001993YDQ,"When are they going to release Young Riders 2 and 3?  A lot of us would like to know.  My 4 children (ages 14,11,10,and 5)are constantly watching things on tv that teach them nothing but violence and un-neccessary violence at that, while these shows give them a little bit of appreciation for what they all have now and the struggles it took to get there.  These shows really taught us what it was like to live in the west and you also can't help falling in love with the characters.  I can't wait until I can watch a real family series with my family again.",1215907200,5,558,4.285714285714286
3427644,5,B001993YDQ,Please release the 2nd and 3rd season of the Young Riders.  It is the best show ever.  You can't beat Baldwin and Brolin in the same show.,1214179200,9,138,4.074074074074074
3427645,5,B001993YDQ,Please release season 2 and 3 because this is an awesome show and I want to own every episode because one season is just a tease and makes me want to write higher up to get the reruns shown on hallmark or the family channel. Such a great show with exceptional actors. Most entertainment I've seen in a long time on tv. PLEASE RELEASE THE OTHER SEASONS!!!!,1213833600,8,355,4.313432835820896

3427649,5,B001993YDQ,This is one of my favorite shows of all time.  I bought season one the day it came out and have been waiting and waiting for the remainders to be released.

Please release!,1211500800,23,431,4.797297297297297

3427701,5,B001993YDQ,I love this show. I remember watching it when it was first on TV and I fell in love with the show and the characters. When I came across it on DVD I had to get it. I Bought 2 copies of season 1 so I can save one incase the first one stops working with as many times that I watch it. When can we get the next 2 seasons? I for sure would buy 2 copies of season 2 and 3 to go with my season 1. I hope it's soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1264291200,,421,3.5376344086021505

3427705,5,B001993YDQ,I heard that Season two was released and then withdrawn.  It is so unfair to release one season and then leave you hanging. PLEASE let us have seasons two and three.,1231372800,2,165,4.32258064516129

3427707,5,B001993YDQ,"I'm from Australia and this great show has never been released here on DVD at all. I pre-ordered the first series from Amazon and have been patiently waiting for the 2nd and 3rd seasons. How much longer are the fans going to have to wait for these releases?? Why not just release the entire series in one box set if they are not going to be released seperately?? I agree with other reviewers that The Young Riders was a great show and there is other shows, nowhere near as good that are being released on DVD. What's up with that?? I have been showing family members who are too young to remember the series and they are completely hooked on the show. PLEASE, PLEASE give the fans a chance to own the complete series and let the new fans enjoy it.",1216512000,6,747,4.304964539007092

8272852,5,B001993YDQ,"Please release the rest of the seasons as soon as possible!!!!!!!!!!!! We enjoy each of the characters so much - CODY - KID - EMMA - TEASPOON - JIMMY - BUCK - IKE - LOUISE AND SAM - BUT I'd have everyone listed first if that could be.  It is a joy to watch them ride - such expert horsemen and horsewomen.  Also, their emotions are front and center along with their intelligence especially displayed in the difficulties they find themselves in.  Plus, they genuinely care about each other and about those who come into their lives as time goes on. WE love Louise and her determination and gentleness, Cody and his rifle and his great humor, Kid and his forward thinking, Emma and her genuineness, Teaspoon and his wisdom of his years, Jimmy and his upfront heart, Buck and his tender care of Ike, Ike and his absolute refusal to let his not being able to speak hold him back from life,  and Sam and his faithfulness, Katey, and all of the other characters who play their parts so well.  Such an excellent series.  Thanks!!!",1337299200,,1023,4.473118279569892

8272854,5,B001993YDQ,"This was a really good TV series. It kept my Husband quiet for the whole hour it was on. Even I enjoyed this show, even though it was (ANOTHER WESTERN). All the actors in this show really fit the parts! Please let us have season 3 on DVD!!!!!",1329523200,,242,4.0625

8272857,5,B001993YDQ,"This is a great show that we just found on hulu this weekend.  We just purchased season 1 today and wanted to get the other two seasons, even though we have only seen a few of the first episodes of season 1.  It's hard to understand why this great show isn't on dvd when so much garbage makes it to dvd.  Guess we will have to watch the other seasons on hulu.",1302393600,,359,3.9583333333333335
8272858,5,B001993YDQ,"Please, please, please release Season's 2 & 3, even if it is released in a box set of all 3 seasons, I'd buy it even though I already have season 1.",1293062400,,148,3.806451612903226
8272859,5,B001993YDQ,"Young Riders is absolutely my favorite show from the time that it first aired until now.  What is the hold up with Seasons 2 and 3?  Amazon, I hope you check these reviews. Over 160 people reviewed Season 1 and gave it a 5 star average. And those people represent a much larger demographic.  It would benefit you to make Seasons 2 and 3 available SOON.  #1 It will be lucrative for you.  #2 The greater part of the fans of this show are about to riot!  We're tired of waiting.  I, as well as many customers, look to Amazon as the leading edge as far as where to buy favorite and often hard-to-find titles in books, music, TV, and movies.  You are letting us down.  We're making our voices heard and you're not listening.  I enjoy all the options that Amazon has to offer, but should someone else make these Seasons available, I will be the first one to buy them from whatever vendor is selling them. Amazon will no doubt lose many sales if this happens. But worse, Amazon has disappointed their customers by not making these Seasons available, as well as shaking their faith that Amazon is the #1 place to turn to when looking for reasonably priced and hard-to-find shows. Amazon, you stand to lose a lot of customer loyalty.  The first place to make these Seasons available is going to get a lot more of my business than just these 2 Seasons. I'm sure most other fans of this show agree with me. So choose or lose, Amazon.",1288742400,,1423,4.3726235741444865

HOPE THIS HELPS ALL YOU DIE HARD YOUNG RIDERS FANS!! AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO COME THROUGH THE MAIL, YOU CAN WATCH IT INSTANTLY!!",1288310400,3,293,3.819672131147541
