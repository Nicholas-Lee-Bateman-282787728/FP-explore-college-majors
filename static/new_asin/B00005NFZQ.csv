Only the pictures on the inlay, making by Brain Adams he can't make one good picture, he is the only artist that deserpoint me with the great song Behind Bleu eyes.
The Who for me the greatest live band ever and this DVD let see it. The quality of the sound en picture on this DVD is very good
Play it loud on 5.1 and you are in the Royal Albert Hall.",1001980800,,479,3.8979591836734695
1632760,5,B00005NFZQ,"This is the reason I own a DVD player.  The sound is incredible.  The visuals are crystal clear.  This is the complete version of the Pay-Per-View show featured on Directv in August, and it is far superior not only because it also includes MY WIFE, RELAY, 5:15, THE REAL ME, and more.  (The PPV was a paltry 90 minutes!) It's because it's all on DVD.  If you have a halfway decent sound system you're going to feel like you're front and center at Royal Albert Hall.
Some have criticized the fast-pace cutting.  I think it's edited the way a rock concert should be.  It creates a frenetic ambience which puts you right on stage with the greatest rock band in the world.  Sure, these guys are pushing sixty, but the energy is still there.  The pouty, snarling Townshend, and the grinning, happy-go-lucky Daltrey, are the yin and yang of this legendary band, and they're anchored by a guy who is probably the best musician of the lot -- John Entwistle, bass player extraordinaire.  (You're going to love the bass-cam shots on 5:15).  Rounding out the quartet and sitting in for Keith ""I died in 1978"" Moon is none other than Zak Starkey, son of a Beatle, and a darn good drummer himself.
I highly recommend this double-disc selection.  (The second disc has some rehearsal footage and a mini-documentary on the charity.  Great stuff, but I must admit I wanted more extras -- maybe some highlights from the 2000 tour?).",1001894400,2,1414,4.6305220883534135
1632761,2,B00005NFZQ,"I saw The Who three times during last years tour. This DVD comes close to capturing their show but has some serious limitations. Picture quality is great, but why must we suffer a jump cut every one to two seconds? Does the director feel this is necessary to maintain our interest? Just when you start to enjoy a scene, you're off to see a super close up of someone or whole hall shot. They should of left the spinning camera zooms back in the sixties. Very distracting. The sound is fair with a somewhat muddy drum and bass mix. And the guests? I can see Eddie Vedder, but Bryan Adams???? Why butcher Who classics just to drag in more guests? Ugh! The band is 5 stars. The DVD missed, it's a 2. A band of this quality deserves more. Hang the director, editor and sound engineer.",1001289600,8,779,4.342465753424658
1632762,5,B00005NFZQ,"Once again, The Who proves it has more firepower in its cannon than The (great) Rolling Stones and any other band on the stage. This DVD was shot three months to the date after I saw The Who tear down the roof of the Reunion Arena in Dallas. As much as it's possible, the DVD captures the energy and emotion of the band under the spotlights. And forget that they're in their mid-50s now ' Townshend, Daltrey and Entwistle all sound as good as they did in the late-60s and early-70s, with great drumming from Zak Starkey and keyboard work from Rabbit Bundrick. Even with most of his hearing gone, Townshend's Stratocaster work here is first-rate. And check out Entwistle's blistering fretwork on ""5.15."" The highlights are too numerous to list, but they're crammed in there on this 2 DVD set. If you like The Who, pick it up ...",1000166400,3,827,4.52
1632763,5,B00005NFZQ,"I also, of course, haven't seen the DVD, but I caught the pay-per-view and was completely blown away.  I was speechless.  For a 20 year old who just recently started listening to The Who, I was amazed that Townshend and Daltry still had this amount of energy.  And the Stage show at the Royal Albert was magnificent, I had to laugh because I was so amazed at the lighting on Baba O'Riley.  If you are a fan of this marvelous band, don't hesitate to buy this concert.  However, to really enjoy the concert, a big screen television and surround speakers are a very very big bonus.",999216000,2,578,4.415094339622642
1632764,4,B00005NFZQ,"Have yet to see the ACTUAL DVD, but I caught the show on Pay-Per-View (and even got to see some of the backstage/rehearsal footage that I assume will be making it onto the discs).  Excellent show!  It never ceases to amaze me how much energy these guys can put into their performance after doing this since what seems like the dawn of man.
Many Who standards are naturally present and accounted for:  My Generation (extended, as usual), The Magic Bus (also in an extended version that rivals the truly magnificent Leeds performance), I Can't Explain, You Better You Bet, Who Are You, all the goodies.
Several guests abound.  Bryan Adams sings on ""Behind Blue Eyes""; Oasis' Noel Gallagher plays git-fiddle on ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" (and yes, Daltrey can still scream...Robert Plant should be jealous), and Eddie Vedder pops up on both ""I'm One"" from Quadrophenia, and ""Let's See Action"".  A few other guests here and there, but I wouldn't want to spoil the surprises.
The only thing preventing this from a five-star rating is the fact that it would be impossible to rate this show as high as some of the peformances from The Who's late-sixties-early-seventies heyday, such as the 1970 Isle of Wight and the Live at Leeds perfomances.  But they do come damn close.
On a technical note, I would also like to point out that for once, the cameramen and the editors finally seemed to know what to look at.  I'm anxious to see the multi-angle stuff boasted for the DVD, but the edition I caught on TV was surprisingly devoid of boring camera work, giving great views of band members, crowd response, and allowing us to take in some of the truly hypnotic light show (especially during the into to ""Baba O'Riley"").",997142400,11,1707,4.7272727272727275

1632838,5,B00005NFZQ,"I won't regurgitate the excellent substantive analysis from other reviewers. I have to say that this performance was incredible. I would pay just to see John Entwistle's unreal bass solo. The guests were additive, the sound quality first rate, and the editing more-than-acceptable. I saw The Who in their first concert after JE died and, if that was any indication, the band will never recapture what they did at this show.

1632839,5,B00005NFZQ,"Review no. 85. Forgot I even had this 2-DVD from The Who's brilliant November 27, 2000 performance. Total of twenty-three Who classics to take in. Couldn't get enough of the show opener ""Can't Explain"", the timeless ""The Kids Are Alright"", the ten-minute foot-stomping ""Magic Bus"" (with Roger Daltrey on killer harmonica), the awesome ""Baba O'Riley"" (with guest violinist Nigel Kennedy), ""Behind Blue Eyes"" (with Bryan Adams), the TRUE '70's FM rock 'n roll classic - played in twelve breath-taking minutes ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" (with guest Noel Gallagher), ""Substitute"", ""My Generation"" and the emotional (with guests Bryan Adams and Eddie Vedder) ""See Me, Feel Me"". Superb picture and sound quality. This is a DVD that simply won't grow old after the first couple of plays. Myself, I didn't get a whole lot from the rehearsal segments. But, hey I loved the actual concert - needless to say. So highly recommended, it almost hurts.",1327881600,2,935,5.117647058823529

1632841,5,B00005NFZQ,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to get Entwistle on DVD, and this was his last concert with The Who.  The 5:15 solo Entwistle does is unsurpassed.  The sound is excellent with this entire concert.
I would also recommend the Concert for NY as well on DVD, since The Who were, in my opinion, the highlight of that concert.",1229817600,,323,4.366666666666666
1632842,5,B00005NFZQ,"I was really taken by the Kids' performance on this one. Their voices were a bit raspy but hey, age catches up with us all. That camera take of good ol' Thunder Fingers (RIP) gave a true look at the Ox's unique way to play the hell of a bass. He will always be remembered. I was particularly pleased with Zack's drum performance (he's no Keith, of course... but he's excellent none the less), which brings me to to the fact that Keith wasn't even mentioned or remembered or not even a picture or something to his tribute. Pete's unique guitar playing was excellent as usual, even after all those years. The talent guests gave an excellent performance and adapted very well to the Who songs and were a nice treat. And best of all, it was for all those teenage cancer patients. Truly a remarkably nice gesture. In all, this is a show that will be remembered and I recommend this DVD to all of us Who true fans and to beginners as well.",1205193600,2,933,4.337142857142857
1632843,5,B00005NFZQ,"This is great show - Like the one Cream Reunion did there later -
I find the levels irratating for some reason - The best part for me is the Special Feathers DVD2 that has the rehearsals on there with guests(Eddie Vedder - Bryan Adams - Pual Weller - Noel Gallagher) it's neat to see them rehearsing - fans never get that angle before since the 1979 rehearsal with Kenny Jones for the first gig with him for the New Who Rainbow Theater gig in London - Ringo's son is at this practice - Roger talks about the charity for sick cancer kids (the Teenage Cancer Trust ) etc.. - and Multi- angle Version of Pinball Wizard Like I said it's not bad but I like other DVD's better like Live Tommy - Quadraphina 3DVD set",1198454400,,709,4.220588235294118

Check out just how much he drove the band with Keith Moon.(which is why I give any WHO DVD without Keith a '4' rating) Its worth buying this just to see Entwhistle on the bass. Such an underrated musician. The other guests are really good as well. Usual power and colour from townsend as well. If, like me you live in Australia then this new version will not play in our zone and you will need to have a DVD player tht can be tuned or changed to all sector zones, otherwise its a bloody hassle.",1185840000,,668,4.1461538461538465

1632866,5,B00005NFZQ,"What a treat this was after watching the ""Tommy and Quadrophenia Live"" DVD.  Don't get me wrong, that DVD was fine, but this one just blew me away.  There are some factors included in this concert that didn't work, but 92% of this concert is incredible.  Let's start with what doesn't work to get it out of the way.  Three of the special guests should not have been there.  I'm referring to Noel Gallagher, Bryan Adams, and Kelly Jones.  Now, I don't really have anything against any of them on their own, but when you put them with the Who, it simply does not fit.  First of all, Noel Gallagher plays on ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" which is my all time favorite Who song.  He plays what Pete should be playing.  The sound is good but I always know in the back of my mind that Townshend should be the lead guitarist on that song rather than Noel Gallagher.  Next, Bryan Adams can not sing ""Behind Blue Eyes.""  It's almost illegal for him to sing that song.  Roger should not have allowed Bryan Adams to sing one of his own most beloved songs (especially since he sings it so well on the Who's Next album).  Bryan Adams could have maybe gotten away with ""You Better You Bet.""  Finally, Kelly Jones should never had been allowed to sing ""Substitute.""  What a let down it was for such a great song to be ruinned by a guy who not only didn't know the words, but also had to drown out Pete's guitar with his own playing.  Only Roger (or Pete) should be allowed to sing ""Substitute"" and ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" and only Pete should be allowed to play guitar on ""Won't Get Fooled Again.""  Thank goodness for the rest of the performances on this DVD.  The best performances are ""I Can't Explain,"" ""Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,"" ""Pinball Wizard,"" ""Relay,"" ""My Wife,"" ""The Kids Are Alright,"" ""Bargain,"" ""Magic Bus,"" ""Who Are You,"" ""Baba O'Riley,"" ""Drowned,"" ""The Real Me,"" ""5:15,"" and ""My Generation.""  Eddie Vedder was smart to pick ""I'm One"" and ""Let's See Action"" to sing on since they are not as well known songs and he does a fantastic job on them.  He fits in with the Who.  Paul Weller also does a great job with Townshend on ""So Sad About Us"" which is also not as well known.  These two guys were smart to pick songs for which they wouldn't upstage anyone in the Who.  ""Getting In Tune"" and ""Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand"" should have been included on the DVD (they're both on the CD).  Pete's guitar playing is at its best since Moon was around.  He is very inspired and there are plenty of close ups of the master at work. Pete is simply one of the five best guitarists to ever set foot on the face of the earth and he proves it on this DVD.  John's bass sounds great throughout the DVD.  His solo on ""5:15"" is amazing but also on ""The Real Me,"" ""My Generation,"" ""Pinball Wizard,"" ""Magic Bus,"" ""My Wife,"" ""Who Are You,"" and many others.  John (rest in peace) is without a doubt the best bass player who ever lived.  I'm so glad that I got a chance to see the Who in concert when he was still alive.  You even get more shots of John on this DVD which is great because the camera was never friendly to him.  Roger is on fire throughout the whole show and Zak Starkey along with John Bundrick play very well too.  Even though this is a post Moon show, it is still one of the best filmed performances of the band.  The camera angles are excellent too as is the sound.  Overall, this is a spectacular DVD with spectacular performances (except for the 3 noted earlier).  However, there should be a reissue of this DVD containing alternate performances of ""Won't Get Fooled Again,"" ""Substitute,"" and ""Behind Blue Eyes"" without the special guests and containing ""Getting In Tune"" and ""Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand.""  Then this DVD would be perfect.  But with all that aside, I would strongly recommend this DVD for any Who fan because 20 out of the 23 performances will blow you away.",1166486400,5,3867,4.395774647887324
1632867,5,B00005NFZQ,"They say that Ringo's good friend, Keith Moon, taught young Zak Starkey how to play drums. Well that's for damn sure. No Ringo here with The Who. If there was anyone that could have and should have stepped in for Keith Moon, it's Zak Starkey. Starkey lifts this performance to the highest plateau's. Oaisis is lucky to have Starkey behind them! Top notch performances on every song and great guests, Noel Gallagher (Oasis) and Eddie Vedder to name a few. Buy this and crank the surround sound, because there is only one way to listen to the Who and one way to watch this concert, LOUD!!!!",1154995200,,588,4.556603773584905
1632868,4,B00005NFZQ,"If this had been an all-Who show, I would have no trouble giving this performance 5 stars.  Pete, Roger and John are on fire at this concert, pouring out lots of energy and power into their songs.  The interaction between band members is great, as are some of the jokes that are passed between them.  It's also great to see and hear John Entwistle on this performance.  His solo during ""5:15"" is particularly amazing.  The Who really aren't the same without John.  I saw them in 2004, with Pino Palladino on bass.  Though great, it just can't measure up.  Pete's acoustic set was nice too, for variety.  All in all, The Who were in 100% top form at the Albert Hall in 2000.

The problem I have with this performance are the special guests, Bryan Adams in particular.  The DVD comes with bonus features which include rehearsal footage, and Pete corrected Mr. Adams twice on the lyrics to ""Behind Blue Eyes.""  He still got it wrong onstage.  The other special guests were okay, but nothing phenominal.  The Who don't need special guests, they are great just on their own.

But this performance was still great, and was also one of the last with John, so for that, it is definitely worth it.",1149811200,7,1188,4.537735849056604
1632869,3,B00005NFZQ,"As a Who fan, I purchased this DVD with excitement and anticipation. As a show, the concert is worth watching.  However, considering the technology available, this DVD sounds like Pete himself mixed it (with his seriously deteriorated hearing)(and I understand that Albert Hall is NOT one of the best accoustical venues). The two 5.1 mixes are horribly tinny with Entwistle's bass nearly non-existent.  And, this is a long concert, so the attack on your ears makes it nearly impossible to view this in one sitting.  Worth purchasing as it's Entwisle's last recorded show before his death, but a disappointment overall.",1142294400,3,618,5.16
1632870,4,B00005NFZQ,"This release shows that classic rock bands sometimes do the right thing by reforming . The Who have had a few tries and of course their fans pay for it . That is fine when a show of this caliber is delivered .

We now have it for posterity - a well filmed show where the camera work moves with the band , sweeping you along .

We can be thankful that John lived long enough to have his bass recorded with modern technology .

The guest stars don't add much to this DVD for me but if it means the band plays some of their lesser heard numbers , then that makes it more bearable .

The second disc does not add much to the value .

I think I've watched it once .

The Who fan will enjoy this , together with THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT .

All in all , a worthwhile presentation .

John Entwistle gets an awesome bass solo on 5:15 and Roger Daltrey has a great sounding harmonica solo on Baba O'Riley(not to mention his amazing singing). Townshend is fantastic and Zak Starkey plays AWESOME drum fills and solos. The last thing I will say is that the setlist is pretty much perfect-every hit I could've wanted.

1632873,5,B00005NFZQ,"Though they've toned their stage act down considerably since the death of Keith Moon, The Who still know how to put on a great live show. And this 2000 concert at the Royal Albert Hall proves that they still have it.

""Live At The Royal Albert Hall"" has Roger, Pete and John at their best. Add to that Zak Starkey, the best of Keith Moon's replacements, as well as phenomenal keyboardist John ""Rabbit"" Brundick and it's  just like old times as The Who rock through energetic performances of classic hits like ""I Can't Explain"", ""Pinball Wizard"", ""Who Are You"", ""Baba O'Riley"", ""You Better You Bet"", ""The Real Me"", ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""My Generation"" and ""See Me, Feel Me"" with the same vitality they had on ""Live At The Leeds"". Granted, I could have done without the guest appearances, but this is an otherwise excellent show.

The bonus features on disc two are very interesting, especially the documentary. This show was done to benefit teenagers with cancer, showing The Who have matured from the pompous, arrogant rockers into sensitive old men. This dvd is definitely worth owning. The Who still have it after all these years.",1121731200,3,1137,4.790816326530612

1632905,5,B00005NFZQ,"I just bought this DVD, and as soon as it arrived I had the concert blaring as loud as I possibly could. This DVD rocks! I have to admit that Roger's voice is shot (You can actually see him wince at one time when his voice cracks), and Pete is getting older (sometimes his background vocals are a little rough), but despite that fact, they give it their all. The sound quality is excellent, but the editing isn't so hot. It might seem to you like the camera people have a bad case of ADD, because you aren't able to focus on one picture, it's always changing. One other minor issue that I have is that on ""Substitute"", with guest singer Kelly Jones, you can see that he's using a music stand with the words/music on it. All the other artists have it memorized, and Jones still messes up the words with the music in front of him. I'll admit that I didn't see it until I had watched it for probably the 10th time. It's nothing important, just something that I thought took away from the show. Other than those few discrepancies, I loved this DVD from start to finish. (I just wish they had played Eminence Front). Bryan Adams really gets into ""Behind Blue Eyes"", and on ""See Me, Feel Me"", he and Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) come back onstage with The Who, and a bunch of kids that I'm assuming are from a local cancer institute join them! Pete Townshend does some of his solo stuff, and Paul Weller joins him for ""So Sad About Us"". All in all, it's a great concert and I would recommend it for anyone who is a die hard Who fan, or even just a casual listener.",1109635200,2,1554,4.253378378378378

The band is energetic and adds just enough reinterpreting twists to their classics to make the songs seem fresh.  The overall production quality is excellent-good camera work and an excellent surround mix.  The guest artists weren't that compelling to me, but I'm really only a fan of Eddie Vedder, so your mileage may vary.  The direction was a bit frenzied.  Outside of an extensive solo, you barely see Entwhistle-a complete oversight to me.  The only really disturbing thing was that I've never seen an audience wearing so many button down shirts in my life!  Weird, very weird.  I've seen better DVD concerts, but this is much better than I anticipated.  A Who fan will love it.  A casual fan will like it.  Non fans will get their eyes opened.

1632909,5,B00005NFZQ,"I was really torn about purchasing this DVD. I love the Who, but was worried that this show might contain shopworn and perfunctory performances from a band well past its prime and relevence.

Wrong!

Live at the Royal Albert Hall is, I think, the ultimate Who documentary -- should music historians wish to the study the group years from now.

While the band isn't as kinetic on stage as they once were (thank goodness!) -- they still have plenty of gas in the tank. Pete Townshend windmilled, Roger Daltry swung his mike like a crazed rodeo clown, John Entwistle rattled the rafters with his bass runs -- and Zack Starkey (all hail Zack) is clearly Keith Moon reincarnated. (Are we sure he's Ringo's son? Did Barbara - Ringo's wife - hang out with Keith much???)

This concert was a fundraiser for a cancer research charity, so in that spirit, many of the Who's musical friends stop by to sit in on several songs. This was a wonderful addition as it lent new texture and life to some old time songs. It didn't work everytime, but for the most part -- a delight!

Eddie Vedder sounds amazing on ""I'm One."" The Sterophonics' Kelly Jones turns ""Substitute"" into a modern day punk anthem. Paul Weller's (The Jam) acoustic duet with Townshend on ""So Sad About Us"" is a wonderful surprise. The only one of these guest appearences that fails is Bryan Adams' flaccid treatment of ""Behind Blue Eyes."" A singer of dubious talent, Adams belongs on stage next to Roger Daltry about as much as I do. And while most guests chose more obscure songs from the Who catalog thus muting possible comparisons, Adams chose the high-profile ""Behind Blue Eyes,"" my personal favorite Who song. Um, let's just say that Roger sings it better.

That one little set back aside, I am so happy I purchased this little slice of rock 'n' roll history. Besides the special guests, it's all here: Pinball Wizard, Bargain, Baba O'Riley, Won't Get Fooled Again, Who Are You, You Better You Bet, The Real Me, 5:15... and on and on. They do quite a few tunes from Quadrophenia, in fact, and that makes me happy too.

1632910,5,B00005NFZQ,"On November 27, 2000, the Who closed their tour with a concert at the Royal Albert Hall.  In my opinion they've never played a better concert.  The looseness of the group makes for a relaxed atmosphere and some really great rock and roll.  There is a lot of improvisational jamming in between songs.  The band acts very free onstage.  For instance, when Roger sings the line, ""Can I buy your magic bus"" Pete screams out ""No!""  All in all a wonderful performance and a great DVD.",1088467200,,478,4.5
1632911,4,B00005NFZQ,"During the playing of John's song, ""My Wife"", the cameras capture a sequence that literally, says it all. The band has just entered an instrumental break. Pete is introduces the line, John tosses his pick to the wind and grabs up great handfuls of bass strings. From there, it's a race. At their best the Who were always like that. They played as if they were trying to run away from the each other but kept landing in the same place. They were evenly matched and ""read"" each other so well it usually worked. Mistakes happened, but hell, those only showed how many chances they were willing to take. Crowds loved that and it literally, cemented their reputation as the greatest live band ever. When Keith died they were still an excellent band but his part of that chemistry was lost. John (Rabbit) Bundrick was (and still is) fine with it, but Kenney Jones wasn't. It was that simple.
Then Zak Starkey came along. When (yet) another tour was announced for the spring of 2000 critics were quick to label it to end up as another zip-less  grab for money. Little did they know. Zak had been with the band for a few years and largely restored the vitality Keith had injected. More important, he gave Entwistle and Townshend someone they could ""run"" with again. When they stripped the band back down again the old fire came back. In the spring, summer and fall of 2000 they hit north America with a  roar that hadn't been seen from anyone from any genre in decades. New material or no, the most explosive live band in rock was back!
Live at the RAH more than illustrates this. That it's a ""greatest hits"" set (with an ""all-star"" guest list to boot) put me off for a while. Don't make the same mistake. The catalogue the Who have to offer is a great one. When it's performed this amount of passion by a band like this it never gets old. Roger can't quite hit all the high notes any longer, Pete doesn't jump a often, or as high and John's singing voice, never great, by this time was close to shot. All of this matters little. Roger has enough passion for ten singers. As well, he brings a level of intelligence and understanding to the material that's rare in the industry. And don't forget, he never takes any nights ""off"". What Pete lost in leaping ability he's gained in musical finesse. This man is playing the guitar the way he did thirty years ago but with all the skill that time and practice have added. Nobody plays like him. Nobody! John was a fabulous player. Ultimately this band may end up missing him even more than they missed Keith. His ability to pick up Townshend's threads and add immediately add to them was the glue which held them together.
The importance of John (Rabbit) Bundrick can't be overstated. He's played with the Who since the late 1970's and it shows. It's hard to imagine keyboard player better suited to working with this outfit. He's literally all over everything Pete and John do as fast as Keith ever was. The guest stars, for the most fit in well. Eddie Vedder is a long time friend of Townshend and a fan. To watch him up there you could swear he knows their music as well as they do. Brian Adams looks a little nervous (for about ten seconds) but then cuts loose. His rendition of ""Behind Blue Eyes"" is classic. Nigel Kennedy comes in and plays the violin part from ""Baba"". He and Townshend have so much fun it has to be illegal (somehow anyway). Noel Gallagher doesn't leave the impact on ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" that Eddie Vedder leaves on ""I'm One"" but he doesn't hurt anything either. The only guest stars who fall a little short are Paul Weller and Kelly Jones. Weller and Townshend just don't mesh all that well. Kelly Jones, unfortunately, leaves you wanting Roger back on the mike to remind everyone what ""Substitute"" is ""supposed"" to sound like. The only other problem lies with the neck mounted camera used to spotlight John's bass solo. This was just a bad idea. It was supposed to give a close look. All it does is give wide angle close-ups that make Entwistle seem disembodied from the rest of the concert. It's too bad. The solo was a good one. Thankfully that camera was only used on the one segment.
This is nit picking though. The performance is a great one. The camera work is superb and the sound quality is fabulous. Buy it, turn it up and enjoy a great rock band doing their thing.",1079481600,43,4341,4.47979797979798

Ripping into the 1st chords of I Can't Explain, Townshend regained his fire, fury, and determination on stage.  The Who reclaimed its title as the greatest live band in the world (in my opinion, the adjective ""live"" has never been necessary).
This video captures The Who at their finest, except that, as noted by another, the editor has ADD, and we can't get an extended, focused look at anyone in the band.  There are times when we catch a glimpse of Townshend attacking his guitar in a brilliant solo, yet the camera inexplicably shifts to Rabbit Bundrick twiddling his fingers.
It is quite humorous to watch Townshend et al. rehearse with Bryan Adams and try to coach him on the lyrics of Behind Blue Eyes, which he can't seem to get right (but my dreams they AREN'T as empty) and then watch Pete roll his eyes and begrudgingly acknowledge Adams the idiot on stage at Royal Albert Hall.

1632934,4,B00005NFZQ,"There was a time when rock was rock. Bands had a heavy bluesy feel instead of the grind it out pop that seems so important today. In those music oriented days of the 70's no band worked harder or louder than The Who. Problem was the 80's came along and it all fell apart. Apart from from inroads into punk and what was then called alternative rock was dead.
The Who tried to resurrect the spirit of the music with their return in 2000. The band was fresh, new younger guests were added to help preserve Roger Daltry's weakened vocal cords and a new generation was introduced to their music. Abruptly all this ended with John Entwistle's death less than a year later.
The Who capped their North American and English tour with a performance for the Teenage Cancer Trust. This performance is the subject of this video.
Close your eyes, turn it up and you'll almost be back in the magic years of the Who's greatest music. The concert is 2.5 hours of pure rock and roll adrealin. From its beginning with I can't Explain to the last Chords of See Me, Feel Me this is the real deal. All members were playing their best. The song list featured 23 hits and there is something here for just about everyone. Dick Cruthers shot the concert from the point of view of a fan. There are many quick cuts to allow you to essentially look everywhere at once.
Do yourself a favor check out the DVD and relive the magic of rock and roll.",1069372800,,1416,4.367424242424242
1632935,5,B00005NFZQ,"The Who were the greatest live band ever between 1969-1976? or they still are?  Well, The Who here seems like it.
This is truly amazing stuff. The selection of the songs is great too, since includes some rare songs hard to get on video, like ""Relay"" or ""Bargain"", and the versions here are awesome.
Keith Moon will be so proud of Zak Starkey (as his dad is for sure). He just has the ""Keith Moon"" spirit, and that's why The Who are like in the old days in this concert.
John Entwistle as always, superb!!.
Daltrey's in great shape, with a stronger or deeper voice than in the 80s concerts like ""Rocks America"" or ""Tommy Live - 20 anniversary"".
Pete Townshend is very inspired and wild. His acoustic performance for a couple of songs in the middle of the show, is superb too.
John ""Rabbit"" Bundrick is excellent as always and adding the right keyboards for the songs that originally didn't include them.
The only thing I don't like about this concert is the guest singers. I would prefer to listen to Roger singing ""Substitute"", for example. The only one I enjoy here is Noel Gallagher in ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", seems he limits to play the guitar (which adds a lot of power to this particular song) and adds backing vocals to the chorus.
Buy this DVD or VHS. The Who were back and this was their testimony. Unfortunally John Entwistle passed away :-(",1066176000,3,1352,4.518367346938776
1632936,5,B00005NFZQ,"The first thing I noticed about this DVD was the production value. I kind of expected it to be half hearted (as I can't imagine that any Who DVD at this point would be a huge seller) - I was wrong, the production is top notch. The picture and sound is flawless.
The song selction is great. It has most of the FM Who standards + some rarely played songs (Relay, So Sad About Us, etc.) that the die hard fans hope for.
There are guest appearances that are actually appealing (I would tend to dislike this addition to any show). Highlight of the appearances is Paul Weller (formerly of The Jam) doing an acoustic duet with Pete Townshend.
Overall, it is a much more inspired performance compared to the 1982 Toronto show, or the Isle of Wight DVD.
Check out John Entwistle's bass solo on 5:15 with the ""bass cam"" giving you a view down the frets. That is a great example of the care that was taken in the production of this release. The Stones recently added this to a few songs in their recent HBO special (think I know where the inspiration for that one came from). Another highlight is Townshend's acoustic version of Drowned.
The special features are pretty good. This is the only DVD I own that has a multi angle feature (finally I was able to get use out of that button on my remote). There is some cool rehearsal footage that you don't want to miss.
I have watched this DVD several times. Think anybody that buys it will be doing the same, especially if they have a surround sound system.",1060992000,5,1492,4.370503597122302

Purists will argue that this particular charity concert shows 3/4 of the actual ""Who"" in grizzled, past-it form, but then they will be missing out on what amounts to a great-sounding, crisp, concert film for those who missed the band the first time around.
No, Zak Starkey is no Keith Moon, but Moon never had a peer to begin with, so it's a pointless comparison--he was, however, Zak's drum teacher for many years, so if nothing else, it's a nice sense of continuity.  But besides all that, he sounds great, and plays tirelessly (something Daltrey, Entwhistle, and Townsend pick up on, and it shows in their performances as well).
It's mostly a collection of greatest hits, but if the DVD is missing the craziness of classic live WHO, it's got plenty of panache and style to make up for it.  The second disc is negligible, but is still nice to have as bonus material.  Good stuff.",1055116800,,1091,4.494949494949495

1632974,4,B00005NFZQ,"Though I purchased this long before John Entwistle passed away, I gotta tell you that one of the highlights is his bass solo about mid-way through the show.
The Who still play fast and furious in concert, so much so that the addition of special guest performers almost slows down the proceedings.  While not every song is a definitive version, there is quite enough here to remind you why you are a Who fan.  The late, great Thunderfingers may have provided The Who with its stability, but Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey are still the main attraction.  And Pete and Roger are up to the task in this performance.  The version of ""Magic Bus"" makes the song sound fresh and new.
With the exception of the Concert For New York City in Fall 2001, this may well be the last live Who concert on video.  That alone should make you consider buying it.",1028419200,,844,4.490196078431373
1632975,4,B00005NFZQ,"This is a great concert with fabulous sound. I saw the Who 3 months before this was filmed and this captures their then-present sound and show. As for the guest stars, don't be afraid of Bryan Adams! He actually sounds good doing Behind Blue Eyes, he has a bit of a sneer to his singing, and doesn't sound like you'd expect. The reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the omitted songs. There were 2 or 3 songs played at the concert that were edited out of the DVD. One of them was a perfect version of Getting in Tune with Eddie Vedder singing along with Roger. I've heard a bootleg recording of it and it is appalling that they would leave in Kelly Jones doing a terrible vocal on Substitute on the DVD, and cut out this great song with Ed Ved. Kelly Jones sings the song with all the annoyance of an Oasis cover version. Also the guitarist from Oasis should be ashamed of standing next to Pete Townshend and only being able to play a wimpy 2-note solo on possibly THE rock anthem of all time, Won't Get Fooled Again. He should not have been invited to the concert. I think many of the guests were used to appeal to the British audience, which is fine, but then don't cut out Getting in Tune, which sounds leaps and bounds over Substitute. Yes, we get a fine version of Ed Vedder singing on Lets See Action and I'm One, and also on the end jam, but Getting In Tune should have been in this DVD. Kelly Jones should not have.
Other than those complaints, what was left in the DVD is a great performance. The editing of the video is a little to quick/MTV. But the sound is great and the Who is awesome.",1027900800,6,1616,4.19935691318328
1632976,5,B00005NFZQ,"Well, this will certainly be the last concert footage of the Who with John Entwistle. The good news is the Who were in great form on this particular night. The set list is inspiring, with along the required crowd pleasers like ""Baba O'Reilly"", ""Can't Explain"", and ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" the Who dusted off some great lesser known gems like ""Bargain"", ""Relay"", and ""So Sad About Us"".
The sound quality is outstanding, with good seperation between instruments and vocals. The mix is so loud that I actually had to turn down the volume much lower than I usually have it set at when watching similar DVDs. Which is great news, because the Who perform with great fire and energy, with Pete Townsend's ferocious guitar playing especially so.
The picture quality is very crisp and sharp, and thankfully in widescreen format. I have a minor quibble regarding some of the fast scene switching, but this is the bane of all concert videos these days. At least it's not as atrociously filmed as the recent 'Elevation 2001 - U2 Live From Boston', which is so inundated with split-second cuts and facial close-ups as to be virtually unwatchable. The director of this video does show lots of full stage shots, and enough close-ups of Pete Townsend playing his guitar to satisfy most guitar aficionados, so I'm not going to complain too much.
The second disk has some extras that while not exactly essential, are a nice added bonus, since the price of this 2 DVD set is what most single DVD's cost.
This is a great concert DVD for anyone who is a Who fan. I've had my interest in this band rise and fall, especially in their later years, but I got to say they definitely got my respect back with this performance. lr** Jul 25,2002.

As a child of the 60's, The Who were grouped into bands like The Kinks or Dave Clark Five. Into the Highschool day's of the 70's, they became part of the soundtrack of a youth ready to crank it up!! Anyone who has ever seen The Who live can tell you. ""The recordings do no justice to the live atmosphere that the Who show brings along with it.""
Althrough the 80' and 90's hearing about Pete never playing live anymore was like ""Oh well,bye bye.""
So I bought this as a nostalgic souvenir. Maybe live in the past for an evening with my buddy Jack Daniels.
Set the speakers up next to the screen, cranked it up to 11 !!
WOW!! THIS IS ONE HOT DVD !! Roger was hitting those notes! John E. proves one more time why he was alway's one of the most influential bass player's of all time.

1632994,5,B00005NFZQ,"This video blew me away.  I mean, The Who were once rock's
greatest live band, as their video/DVD ""Live At The Isle Of
Wight"", or their documentary ""The Kids Are Alright"" will attest.
However, ever since Moon's death they have been struggling to
find an adequate replacement and for several years in the 90s
Townshend stuck to acoustic playing in order to save his
battered eardrums; add to this the atrocity that was the Broadway
Tommy and I was ready to write off the band entirely.
I couldn't have been more wrong: this show, taped in Nov 2000 as the bandmembers were in their late 50s, shows just as much explosive energy and excitement as anything they've ever done--if not more!  Daltrey's voice is as powerful as ever and
never wears out during the 2 1/2 hour performance, Entwistle
is as virtuosic as ever (check out the ""5.15"" solo) and it's
great to see Townshend back to his windmills and high leaps on
the electric guitar.  Even better, the group have finally found
a drummer who is reminiscent of the late great Moon, and it's
none other than Zak Starkey, Ringo's son.  He is their first drummer since Moon to actually propel the songs forward with
an extra kick, and it's clear that he has studied Moon's style
with meticulous care.  The result is a group that has been
re-energized to sound like they haven't since the mid-70s; it's
as if no time has elapsed at all in the 25 years since their
prime.  Another plus is that they keep the sound lean and mean
with just the four of them plus an excellent keyboardist--none
of the bloated extra musicians and backup singers that mar a lot
of other dinosaur groups in their comeback tours (The Rolling
Stones, anyone?).
There are some guest artists, but these are mostly great: Paul
Weller turns in a fine duet with Townshend on the overlooked
classic ""So Sad About Us"", Eddie Vedder serves up typically
passionate performances of ""I Am One"" and ""Let's See Action"",
Noel Gallagher contributes some fine guitarwork to ""Won't Get
Fooled Again""...and oh yes, Bryan Adams mangles ""Behind Blue
Eyes"" and some kid from The Stereophonics (Kelly Jones) tries
to tackle ""Substitute"" but is outstaged by Daltrey's backup.
Overall, though, the high points far outweigh the one or two
missteps: ""Magic Bus"" climaxes with a finale that blows the lid
off of even the Leeds or Wight versions, ""The Kids Are Alright""
is doubled in length and includes a heartfelt new lyric, ""The Relay"" grooves and grooves, ""You Better You Bet"" is tight and
punchy, ""The Real Me"" and ""5.15"" are the best performances I've
ever heard of these ""Quadrophenia"" numbers, and so on.  And although the newest song they play is from 1981, their back
catalogue is such that every single song they choose is a five-
star masterpiece.  Unlike the flaccid, soulless and overly-
choreographed recent tours by Pink Floyd, Fleetwood Mac or The
Rolling Stones, there's still plenty of 70s-style improvisation and teenaged raw energy flowing their veins...The Who have outclassed every ""dinosaur"" band that ever was and kept their
legacy intact.  Daltrey and Townshend both look in very high
spirits throughout, as they take their audience on a tour through their early mod classics, progressive 70s work, maximum
R&B raveups, acoustic ballads and more.  Their music is such
that the audience was comprised of people of all ages--teenagers
and middle-age baby boomers equally shouted the lyrics with passionate abandon.  Considering that the bandmembers are now approaching 60, their seeming drink from the fountain of youth
seems like a miracle. Thanks for not only not letting me down,
but surpassing even my wildest expectations and trying to outdo
their seemingly untouchable late 60s/early 70s prime...let's
just forget about that whole Broadway Tommy thing, OK...?",1015632000,6,3780,4.918367346938775

The widescreen transfer was nicely done, as was the video production in general. My only complaint about the video was noticeable artifacting from MPEG compression when I paused the DVD a few times. But nothing objectionable really.
However, the sound engineering on this DVD left quite a lot to be desired as the mixing was very unbalanced.  The quality of the sound itself is very good, it's the sound engineering on stage that seems to be the problem. While Pete's guitar work came through nice and clear, the drums and bass guitar didn't. I tested both the Dolby Digital and DTS tracks, both of which exhibited the same poor sound quality - as if someone were recording the concert standing out in the audience with a good quality tape recorder.  Voices were often muddled and difficult to hear clearly. Pete Townshend's voice was heard echoing strangely through the hall, and Entwhistle's fabulous bass was largely lost in a muddle of sound.
In the end though, this was an excellent performance and an entertaining DVD.  I was pretty down on the sound quality of this DVD on my initial review, but went back to listen to it again and on a friend's system with the same result.  And to the reviewer who said I was deaf, I'm also a musician and I assure you, this is not the case.
Performance: A
Video Quality: A
Sound Quality: C+ (B+ for overall quality, C- for engineerig/mixing)",1012089600,7,1865,4.764705882352941
1632997,5,B00005NFZQ,"I've watched this video 4 times since Christmas -- good thing it's a DVD -- I'd wear out a tape! I saw The Who live in 1971 after ""Who's Next?"" came out, and 3 more times over the years. The greatest shows I've ever seen. We were fortunate enough to see this tour in Denver in August of 2000, and wondered when a video would be coming. We took our teenage daughters to this concert -- their first classic rock concert. They were speechless -- totally amazed at how great a ""bunch of old guys"" could perform. Owning the DVD will let me relive that concert for a long time. A week ago, we saw Tommy on stage in Denver, and the paper said that The Who would be touring the US next summer again. I hope this is true. I'll attend ever concert I can, nobody can compare! Do not miss seeing them live in you have the chance, but in the meantime, buy the DVD! Definitely the greatest band to ever hit the stage!",1011484800,3,903,4.136363636363637
1632998,5,B00005NFZQ,"The Who deliver in this DVD an excelent performance that reminds us that youth comes from actitude and not from age. In fact, this has been one of the most interesting concert releases of 2001 in terms of performance energy!!
Recorded during a benefit concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London the Who is augmented by guest performers like Bryan Adams, Nigel Kennedy, Eddie Veder and others. The truth is that the main attraction on this concert is the Who. Every member performance is in top form and the band goes through many hits songs in an intense and long set. Not bad for a band that has not released any new material in years. Key to note is that the band avoids sounding like the Who covering themselves like other Classic Rock bands that end up giving the audience not so good interpretation of old material. In this case the Who, as a band, is as relevan and intense as 30 years ago.
As for the DVD the first disc cover mainly the concert and the second one has the extras with rehersal footage with guest performers and other stuff but nothing really out of the ordinary. Sound quality is excelent and the images are clear.",1011139200,5,1137,4.471153846153846
1632999,5,B00005NFZQ,"I've only watched it once so far, but I loved the performances by Pete, Roger, John & Zak.  The guests were just a distraction, for me.  And actually, I didn't like Eddie Vedder.  The introduction-parade of the guests gives a stilted feel to the end of the performance - just between the songs, though.  When the music is playing, The Who is great, as usual!",1010880000,,358,4.461538461538462
1633000,5,B00005NFZQ,"This is an A++ DVD. The video is excellent, the audio is perfect, and most importantly the performance has more energy and consistency than most latter-day Who concerts. The guest stars are a small plus.
This DVD is definitely a ""Bargain"", the best I ever"" ....well, certainly a bargain.",1007856000,,287,4.877551020408164
1633001,5,B00005NFZQ,"The performance by The Who is absolutely amazing! With Zak Starkey
on drums and John Bundrick on keyboards,The Who prove once again
why they are still the greatest live band in rock history. Anybody who is a fan of live rock and roll will see the masters at work. The clarity of this DVD is outstanding as The Who
perform powerful versions of their greatest hits. Joined by Noel Gallagher of Oasis,Bryan Adams and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam,The Who show why they are the best. If you are a Who fan this DVD is a must...if not,your missing out. U2,Oasis,and Pearl Jam should all take note and see how it's done",1007683200,2,608,4.4375
1633002,5,B00005NFZQ,"The guys gave a great performance, capturing a lot of their recent tour's sound and energy.
The DVD has some extra rehearsal footage that could and should have been more extensive. The scene 2-3 second scene edits were a bit uncomfortable as well.",1007337600,,247,4.767441860465116
1633003,5,B00005NFZQ,"Flaws - Brian Adams screws up ""Behind Blue Eyes.""
Highlights - Some of the best work I have ever heard.  Pete Townsend, I don't know how but he got even better on the guitar.  3 minute songs are turned into 6 minute epic guitar jams with solos galore.  John on his base will blow you away on 5:51.  Roger, what can I say his voice is still able to belt out the lyrics and whip the mike around his head.
I have never heard or seen a better performence.",1005523200,4,451,4.033707865168539
1633034,5,B00005NFZQ,"Wow was I surprised how good these guys still sound, sure a few of the greatest tunes had to be altered a bit, so Roger could pass over some of the crazy high notes he used to hit. But over all the sound and quality of this band is still amazing. Pete is back at windmilling and jamming on electric axe, he took some time off in the last few years playing only acoustic, claiming his hands were too tired and bleeding. He even went so far as to have another electric player in concert over the last few years. This time its only pete at his finest! Almost all of the songs you want to hear are included.  I can't say enough how this dvd made me feel I was at the Who in concert over again, I have seen them twice, once in 82 and once in 83. I can honestly say I enjoyed watching this dvd almost as much! The quality of the recording and camera work really was tops! If you like the who at all, you have to see this dvd!",1005350400,4,919,3.9408602150537635
1633035,5,B00005NFZQ,"This review is on the VHS tape. DVD is avilable in Peru (South America) but the region 4 encoding permits a limited selection of DVD's available. Anyway, all my other music tapes are on VHS. I'll catch up with the DVD'S later on.
The show is great all around. The picture and sound are VERY GOOD. I have my Hi Fi Stereo VHS hooked up to my sound equipment with four speakers and a 29"" Sony TV. Once you crank up the volume you can get an accurate and good feeling of the excitement and the power of The Who's live performance in the 2000 tour. I had heard that P.Townshend was suffering acute hearing problems, but he has clearly recovered because he and the band just BLAST AWAY at FULL POWER !! I can only imagine the sore eardrums of those who had the luck of seeing the band live on the 2000 tour.
The shots (filming)are good although I notice that the editing of the video was done by someone who doesn't know THE WHO'S repertoire very well. The editing misses out on some (few) important action shots and just switches the images to much. But it can pass, it's OK.
The song selection is one of the high points of the concert with the band turning out great versions of WHO jewels such as Relay, Bargain, The Real Me, Let's see action, I'm One, and a wide variety of songs that I hadn't heard or seen played live before. It's great to see the band in great musical shape turn out songs from what I consider their best albums ""Who's Next"" and ""Quadrophenia"". Zak Starkey's Moonish style of playing the drums really melts in great with The Who and ""Rabbit"" fits in perfectly with the band as always. They really give an accurate feeling of The Who in their best 70's moments (LOUD) accented with todays technology advances in sound and instrumentation. Pete plays very well with no worry about his or anyone's ears, Roger gets by OK+ on vocals and The OX is magnificent on bass (his solo on 5:15 is awesome).
Don't worry to much about the guests, they have an acceptable participation and generally don't interfere with what we all want to see which is THE WHO.
I DEFINITIVELY RECOMEND THAT YOU PURCHASE THIS TAPE / DVD YOU'LL GET PLENTY FOR YOUR INVESTMENT. AS A LAST THOUGHT I HOPE THE WHO REALIZES THAT THEY CAN STILL BLOW OFF THE STAGE WITH EASE ANY YOUNGER BAND AROUND TODAY. SO, I HOPE THEY MAKE THE MOST OF THE LEFTOVER ENERGY THEY HAVE AND TAKE TO THE ROAD SOON AGAIN. THEY MOST SURELY WILL PACK ARENAS WITH EASE. I HOPE THEY THINK ABOUT NEW AUDIENCES WHICH WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO RECIVE THEIR VISIT. HERE IN PERU THEY WOULD MEET A FULL HOUSE WITHOUT A DOUBT.
HAVE A GREAT TIME WATCHING THE ""STILL"" GREATEST ROCK BAND IN THE WORLD. AND HEY WATCH THE CONCERT AT FULL VOLUME !!!  LONG LIVE ROCK AND THE WHO!!",1005350400,4,2716,4.367588932806324
1633036,5,B00005NFZQ,"Like all the other reviewers state,these guys take no prisoners during this concert. Shear guts of a performance. Don't even bring up the Boring Stones.
 The show starts out a little slow, but God does it take off after a couple of songs. They take two of my least favorite Who songs, Magic Bus and Who Are You, and made me absolutely love them. You just won't believe the energy these guys put out. Starkey is not just a fill-in on the drums. To my ears he is much better than Kenny Jones.
  The DTS encoding for this concert is very hot. Hope you have a good surround system,because you are going to want to play it loud. There is no other way.
  Hell, just buy it! If you are a 50ish old guy these guys will make you feel proud!",1005091200,2,731,4.156028368794326
1633037,4,B00005NFZQ,"What keeps me from giving this DVD/Concert an Excellent are:
1) The pace on PINBALL WIZARD is so frenetic one supposes the band didn't want to be bothered by it anymore.  2) Guest Bryan Adams commits the unpardonable sin of singing BEHIND BLUE EYES while a way-too-generous Daltrey is on backing vocals and guitar.  3) Townshend embraces too-long song intros throughout, which are only occasionally interesting.  4) As regards the extra features, such as backstage footage and rehearsal glimpses, one wishes there were more of them, but what's there favors the guest artist.  Possibly because THE WHO, coming off a tour, didn't need to rehearse for their own sakes.  But having said all that, that was the dross, and the gold of the performances outweigh it.  With Zak Starkey (Ringo's son) on drums, he's given extensive camera time not alloted to the keyboardist, and he seems to fit right in.  But there are extensive instrumental breaks throughout, including shots from a camera mount on Entwistle's bass.  Amazingly, the power and virtuosity of Daltrey's vocals remain unmatched in rock/pop.  One wonders how he still has vocal chords left after all these years.  A real gem is the brilliance and vitality of BARGAIN and the affectionate teasing between Daltrey and Townshend.  Great clarity on visuals and audio throughout. Only wish the guys felt like doing it more often.",1005004800,2,1379,5.057522123893805
1633038,5,B00005NFZQ,"With the memory of the November 2000 concert in Manchester still fresh in my mind I bought this DVD.  Immediatly the band seemed 'up for it.'  Kicking into 'I can't Explain' I could almost close my eyes and imagine it was the early 70's at one of those football stadium concerts.  Zak, on drums, seemed to compliment Pete, John and Roger superbly.  Don't expect to see The Who trying to recapture what they once were, they just play a different way, almost cultured, but the same raw energy is still there.",1004572800,2,506,4.527472527472527
1633039,3,B00005NFZQ,"If you are a new fan, this will seem great. Perhaps for some of the old fans....there is enough here to still suffice. The Who have changed and this is a video that proves it. Pete can play faster now thanever before...w/riffs that he could play in his sleep. Roger cannot hit high notes like he used to. This is a greatest hits show...if this was another band I'd be impressed....but alas...its not. Townshend needs to continue w/ his musical journey and figure out what it is that he wants to say. The playing on this show...high speed boring-AND thats NOT ok for the worlds greatest band.
Listen to the version of Who are you from the LifeHouse box set to know how much is missing from this show.",1004227200,2,699,4.426356589147287
1633040,5,B00005NFZQ,"When I saw The Who perform here in Seattle back in their heyday, they were unquestionably one of the top live rock groups on the scene. By the time they played a benefit for Kampuchia (1979?) and their 1982 ""Farewell Tour"", they had devolved into a mere shadow of their former selves, going though the motions, looking tired and uninspired. I remember remarking that the song ""My Generation"" with the lyrics ""Hope I die before I get old"" were conspicuously missing from those final tours.
Now, all these years later, after reading rave reviews of this Albert Hall 2000 DVD, I bought a copy, and was floored. From Pete Townsend's opening chords of ""I Can't Explain"" it was as if the Who magically recaptured the power,intensity and stage presence they had thirty years ago. Songs like ""Relay"" ""My Wife"" ""Magic Bus"" ""Bargain"" ""5:15"" are played as well as I've ever heard them. In fact, I can't think of another rock band formed in the past 25 years that can touch these guys' energy even though Townsend, Daltrey and Entwistle are pushing 60. The younger members of the band, Zac Starkey on drums and John Bundrick on keyboards fit right in, excellent musicians.
I recognize that this was a benefit show, and these often involve special guests. However, the Who is such a great band that the appearance of guests only subtracts from the show in my opinion. One exception is violinist extraordinaire Nigel Kennedy who does a great job on Baba O'Reilley, and on another positive note, at least Phil Collins (the usual benefit guest) wasn't invited.
The frosting on the cake is that the show is impeccably filmed (although I agree with another reviewer that the edits every 3 seconds is too much) and the sound is first rate. This is what DVD is all about.",1004140800,16,1751,4.706840390879479
1633041,5,B00005NFZQ,"I could waste your time with a drawn out discussion on why you should add this DVD to your entertainment system, but I will get right to the point.  If you have any Who music and have enjoyed their music over the years, you will love this DVD.  I could not have picked a better set to hear.  You get to enjoy 3 different versions of music on the DVD. 1-The Power Who 2-The Acoustic Who 3-The Special Guests taking part in Who songs.  You will also enjoy the John Entwistle ""Bass Cam"" on 5.15  Spend the 20 bucks, it is well worth it.",1002672000,,533,4.086538461538462

The Who without Ox is like a margarita without tequila. Thankfully, someone noticed and he's present midway until the end. Also, one of the guest musicians (the guy in blue jean jacket) was a very questionable addition. Thankfully Pete sent him on his way after one song. And they never introduce Zak Starkey banging away on his kit (who is also well down in the audio mix).",1429142400,,518,4.580645161290323
