2726964,5,B000M8N76O,In a world dominated with hollywood films that really carry little if any weight.  It is truly a blessing that gems like this are still made.  And FYI the Spanish scenes do have subtitles.  Maybe you just need to turn them on.,1174953600,,226,4.333333333333333

2726966,4,B000M8N76O,"This is a good and inspiring video...has several good points you can ""keep"". It is similar to ""One"" but I liked ""One"" better. Good video.",1174780800,2,137,4.52
2726967,1,B000M8N76O,"For those of us who aren't quite sure of ourselves or just need a reminder that we are as powerful as we allow ourselves to be, this is the perfect reality check movie.  It is also partly in Spanish.",1174435200,2,199,4.102564102564102

2726969,5,B000M8N76O,"Oren manages to capture the true meaning of life. He's able to show everybody how, through daily events with ordinary people and also some celebrities, dreams can be achieved if you fight for them. A truly masterpiece.",1169164800,3,218,4.918918918918919

2726973,5,B000M8N76O,Once you watch this you will see the idea everywhere.  Just last week I was watching an interview with Will Smith and he said he got to where he is by putting the idea of his success out there so there was no way it couldn't happen.  It inspires you to believe the world is really a positive place if you choose for it to be one!,1168214400,4,329,3.8955223880597014
8167189,1,B000M8N76O,"I was so disappointed. I own about 50ish documentaries on the law of attraction, positive self talk, making changes in ones life, etc.  This movie gave so suggestions on what someone can do to make changes in their life, other than just quit your job and follow your dream which may work for some, but without the ""how to"" part, I found it quite useless.  To date, I have loaned it to 4 people and they gave it back with basically the same report.  This is the very first time I have bought a video and felt that I totally wasted my money.  Usually, I get something out of everything I watch.",1287878400,,592,4.258928571428571
8167190,2,B000M8N76O,"Sorry,
This video just didn't do it for me. Was really expecting something much more. You know you pack up and take off somewhere and let things happen for you. Not really a new idea.",1273104000,,183,4.257142857142857
8167191,5,B000M8N76O,"Can't believe I hadn't heard about this movie before, I don't even remember how I stumbled upon it. It should have gotten more press. It's not flashy and obvisously done on a low budget but it's real and feels authentic with good message. The writer puts his own twist on things which keeps ones attention. A powerful LOA docu-movie to add to any library.",1256342400,,355,4.5625
8167192,5,B000M8N76O,Loved this movie.  It is so inspiring for those of us that tend to do things out of the norm  and put our trust in God and our soul's path and intention.,1255824000,,153,3.75
8167193,2,B000M8N76O,"I didn't get a great deal out of this DVD. There are a lot of subtitles and, at least on my TV, they were very hard to read. If your looking for a ""how to"" this isn't it, in my opinion. This is more of a ""I believed and it worked for me.""",1207785600,,238,3.509433962264151
8167194,5,B000M8N76O,"I loved waking up today (Saturday) with the plan to watch TRUST22 and then continue in the pursuit of my dreams.  The reviews gave me the faith to get the movie and plan to start the weekend with it.  My dream is bold.

This movie is whatever you want it be.  For me, I wanted something that spoke directly to dreamers.  Oh, did it deliver. It didn't just speak of the ""easy"" parts of pursuing your dreams... it also mentions the moments of self-sabotage in the guise of logic.  Then it pointed out the switching of their state-of-mind inside and what follows.

I think we are all dreamers.  Most of us are focused on working at their current job to get them to where they want to be. When they realize working there is NOT getting them anywhere, they give up altogether and point out the dream was unrealistic.  Ouch!

This movie reminds us what is possible.  Personally, it rekindles the fire within me for what I am here to do and be.  Sure it shares ideas on how to move forward but more importantly, I think it helps keep one open to the possibility of the greatest possible outcome--- instead of the least.  The making of the movie is built on the same techniques that it points out in other people's dreams all over the world.  As humans we need to expose ourselves to movies just like this.  I look forward to the next one.

This DVD was release in 2006 and I watched it Feb 16th of 2008.  Perfect timing.",1203120000,,1413,4.3320610687022905
8167195,2,B000M8N76O,"to make a movie about making a movie ...
well I didn't like it very much I liked the scenes from the school in africa though lots of talented kids there",1202256000,,152,3.935483870967742
8167196,5,B000M8N76O,"I didn't know what to expect before I started watching. As it unfolded, I felt increasingly curious about the outcome and started, honestly, rooting for the eventual success of the different stories depicted. There are some unbelievably moving moments within the film, and it left me with a feeling of hope and serenity.
I highly recommend it, both as a self-help message, and as a true testament to high-minded ideas.

8167197,5,B000M8N76O,"TRUST 22 left me totally inspired and made me feel that anything is possible, about our dreams.
This film is very uplifting, fresh, smiley, well done. Watching all these people sharing their experience is like beyond THE SECRET. THE SECRET proposes the formula, TRUST 22 shows the results about that formula with real people, including the filmmaker who made his dream comes true while he was developing and believing on it. The cinematography is really beautiful and the way how the director drives us to the end is amazing. I have now both films together (Secret",1186531200,,564,4.885416666666667
8167198,5,B000M8N76O,"I was inspired by this film to finally commit to solving my eternal dilema of  How can I live and pursue my dreams at the same time? The characters a are real people (Not Philosopher or University Professors) who practice what they preach. You follow them as they prove that once you accept that the Universe is conspiring to help you achieve, all you have to do is Trust 22 and work hard to reap the success that will come.

I really enjoyed how the director put a nice spin on the narrative Documentary VO that we are so used to hearing.  The film is shot all over the world showing the true beauty in us all.  I dare you not to smile as you watch it. Buy the film I Trust 22 that you will not be disappointed.",1185667200,,712,4.100719424460432
