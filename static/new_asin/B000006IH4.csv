7904412,5,B000006IH4,"Ignore the haters. Good relaxing music with some nature sounds and time lapse video of beautiful, pristine landscapes. This was originally released a long time ago. If you are looking for HD video and 512kbps audio samples, find something newer.",1458000000,,245,5.15
7904413,1,B000006IH4,"Horrible dvd. Picture quality is aweful, equivalent to watching a VHS that has been watched a couple of hundred times. Opposite of relaxation, I wanted slow motion but this whole thing is too fast. Also, I have never seen the northern lights look so bad, never. Don't buy this dvd. This was a one man operation, by an individual that googled a bunch of clips and pieced it together on his PC. They say there is a sucker born every minute and this time I was that sucker.",1313798400,,470,4.3522727272727275
7904414,1,B000006IH4,"I teach film & video production & in preparation for a course I will soon teach, ""Observations in High Speed & Time Lapse,"" I purchased this DVD, hoping it wd be something I cd share with my students as an example.  I am very disappointed.  Even with vacuous music turned off, the edited structure of this video & the majority of the image choices are hackneyed & vapid.  Definitely not a worthwhile purchase for the contemplative viewer.  I won't show this to my students or ever spend time looking at it again.",1303948800,,512,4.532608695652174
