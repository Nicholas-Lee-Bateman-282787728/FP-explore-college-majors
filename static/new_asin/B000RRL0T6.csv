8202390,1,B000RRL0T6,"If you want the real science, listen to scientists. All the folks behind this video have no formal science training.. they don't know how to formally review the findings.
This is all miss-information, sadly. If you're interested in hearing actual scientists talk about the process of genetic engineering, go check out Neil Degrasses' movie/YouTube videos on the subject, or Bill Nye... (Both trained scientists who ironically find pretty much the exact opposite)",1504915200,,462,5.430555555555555
8202391,5,B000RRL0T6,This really opened my eyes!  The same thing is going on in the vaccine world.  This option is great for parents as I found one of the DVD's to be very informative for parents.,1495411200,,175,4.117647058823529
8202392,5,B000RRL0T6,Information everyone needs to know if you want to live a healthier life.,1436918400,,72,4.615384615384615
8202393,5,B000RRL0T6,Great information for everyone.,1425513600,,31,7.0
8202394,4,B000RRL0T6,"I would have given it 5 stars but other than Tumeric is now a GMO, I did not learn anything new from what I have already learned.  The plight of the farmers in India breaks my heart.  It is clear, these GMO companies are run by Jezabel control freak spirits.",1398988800,2,258,4.14
8202395,4,B000RRL0T6,"I have only one gripe about books and DVDs focusing on exposing Monsanto and similar companies. Authors and producers take notice please: IF you are truly intent on getting this information into the hands of normal, everyday Americans, LOWER your prices. If someone is just browsing the topic but not sure whether to invest reading and viewing time, the less expensive the item, the easier it will be for them to make a positive decision to buy. Period. I'm not suggesting you stop making a living at this, just begin catering to the masses who ARE your audience. What's required for people to become involved: It ALL comes down to money, whether it's Monsanto suing a small farmer...or a low income but passionate individual American who wants to know what's happening to the food in our country and how to feed their families. Decisions whether to buy a DVD or pay a bill? You will lose every time unless you make your material very widely available and cheap. Worked for the first Bible printed on the world's first printing press hundreds of years ago. The content was put directly and cheaply into the hands of everyday people who had no direct access to that information prior to that...and the same principle would still work today.",1387497600,2,1239,4.767441860465116
8202396,5,B000RRL0T6,"Highly informative and well researched; this is the most comprehensive film on the subject and it is a very very important subject to all life on this planet: human, plant, or animal. Everyone needs to see this!",1328745600,,211,4.72972972972973
8202397,5,B000RRL0T6,A little repitive but it's full of how GMO's affect you and all the science behind it. A little monotonous at times but really worth seeing.,1328227200,,140,4.423076923076923
