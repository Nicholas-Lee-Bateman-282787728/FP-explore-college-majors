8424789,5,B0017GN8HI,"It is unfortunate that Vanessa Paradis is known in America mainly as The Mother of Johnny Depp's Children. Ms. Paradis, now almost 40, was a singing star at age 15, an feature-film actress not long after that, mentored by Serge Gainsbourg and Lenny Kravitz, and has grown-up to be formidably talented as a singer, songwriter, and actress. This film, ""Elisa,"" shows her in her early adulthood, inhabiting her character in almost chilling authenticity. While to some people her nudity may overshadow her acting, in this film, I myself can't stop watching her large, expressive eyes, which seem to tell the story all by themselves. This leaves me with the feeling that I am looking into her character's soul. I purchased this DVD because I had been interested in her music, but what I had heard had not prepared me for what I saw.

This film contains some comic moments to leaven the abiding tone of gravity and the scenes of Marie (played by Ms. Paradis) blowing-up at people. There are also moments of incidental tenderness, showing us that Marie's life isn't so bad, despite her hardship and bitterness. Ms. Paradis conveys, throughout, however, the hardness resulting from a life on the streets, getting over by exploiting human frailties and thereby growing contemptuous of them.

Gerard Depardieu holds his own sturdily against Vanessa Paradis's embuttered provocateuse, rivaling her with a profound cynicism and callous dismay for love and its vainglorious illusions. Although there is an obtuse incestuous theme to the story, it is a story of two people coming to terms with their pasts and finding them to not have been as bad as their own selfish emotions had made them seem. This would be the perfect film to be viewed by any young woman who had been estranged from her father and had relied upon hearsay or secondhand ideas for any understanding of him as a person.",1330473600,2,1874,4.908517350157728
