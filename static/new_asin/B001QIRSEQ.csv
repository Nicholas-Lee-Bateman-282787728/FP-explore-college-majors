3765002,1,B001QIRSEQ,"This DVD was an almost complete waste of money.  All it contains in a bunch of self-congratulatory young chefs running around frantically around a studio kitchen, and then eating their own cooking and praising their own abilities.  There is very little to be learned on these DVDs.  The one good bit was the chef making risotto, and it was good only for its comic effect, as he ran around the counter from pot to pot to pot.  I don't think even an advanced chef has much to learn from this, and it's a total waste for a beginner.  Instead, spend your money on DVDs by Julia Child or Lidia Bastianich or Jacques Pepin, chefs who actually teach something.",1273104000,28,653,4.5

8335688,3,B001QIRSEQ,"This DVD is 14 years old, I was relevant then but its outdated now. The visual aspect is good, similar to the iron chefs cameras getting close and moving around. As far as the actual content, this is not a cooking course; its more like a demonstration that implies that you will be able to pick up the details and integrate them into your cooking technique.

Most of the actual recipes are basic French: Pan frying, pan & wine sauces, mirepoix and bouquet garni into everything.
It seems like these cooks just got out of culinary school and put on DVD what they learned in the first semester.

Buy this if you want to see some basic French by non French chefs with a good view.",1362960000,,677,4.365079365079365
8335689,4,B001QIRSEQ,You can down load thousands of recipts from the internet. This dvd set teaches you how pros cook in a kitchen. I learned a lot and I have run a kitchen before. You will learn many bases for things. You get a taste of fine dinning.,1355788800,,230,4.021739130434782
8335690,4,B001QIRSEQ,"This is not a DVD about using recipes to cook stuff. It covers fundamental French-style cooking techniques. If you want recipes, try Julia Childs' ""The Way to Cook"" or any number of the excellent DVDs out there. Once you get a feel for the techniques presented on ""Cook Like a Chef"", and know how things will taste because you practiced them, you don't really need recipes. BTW, I emulated its turkey-roasting segment and oh, boy, was that bird good.

There is an out-of-print companion cookbook, ""cook like a chef."" It is by Chris Knight, ISBN 1-55285-612-7.",1343692800,,559,4.822916666666667
8335691,5,B001QIRSEQ,"If you can only buy one cooking dvd, this is it! I have over one hundred but this one is la creme de la creme I have worn mine out! would love to buy more with the same chefs teaching you the recipes!!  They taught me so much thanks to all of you.",1325894400,2,247,3.660377358490566
8335692,2,B001QIRSEQ,"No measured recipes, odd pacing and the music was distracting as were the chef vinettes.  I do NOT recommend this to anyone!",1312934400,,124,4.636363636363637
8335693,5,B001QIRSEQ,"Cook like a Chef is without question the best and most engaging cooking series I have ever watched for a number of reasons. Like many other people I have cooked at home all my life from a young age and enjoy it immensely as well as being pretty skilled at it. Yet almost every episode increases my knowledge, shows me a new technique or broadens my appreciation of the art of cooking in some way.

Head chefs from top restauraunts and institutions across Canada demonstrate techniques and some different ways to cook using the episodes featured ingredient/method/style with their own personal touch - they even bring along their own kitchen assistants. Most of the chefs have great personalities and an obvious passion for cooking which makes for a very engaging learning experience. Anyone who thinks these chefs are inexperienced or overconfident either has no idea about cooking whatsoever, or holds a couple of michellin stars.

It's true they do not give exact recepies however that is not the idea of this series - if you need recepies buy a good cookbook as well. This is a teaching show on the many aspects of how to cook like a chef - the purpose built set kitchen is easily as well equipped as 'Iron Chef' if not better, and is designed to allow unprecedented camera access to the preparation area with plenty of room to move. The camera work and editing are top notch - the viewer can see exactly what the chefs are doing from multiple angles with great close-ups on important techniques or critical stages of cooking. Unlike other shows with one fixed offscreen camera that's quite far away from the action, the 4 or so cameramen on this set are always in plain view of eachother and moving around, which gives the feel that you are right there yourself.

The chefs don't waste time making you watch basic or lengthy mundane processes, but rather get it started and then delegate to the assistant(s) as would happen in a commercial kitchen - instead they get on with demonstrating preparation of the next stage or dish. As soon as something goes into the oven or onto the stove, the pre-prepared one comes out with perfect timing, giving the show a nice fluid feel that's often missing from regular cooking shows.

Cook like a Chef has aired literally hundreds of episodes on foodtv.ca so this first season is only a small fraction. Given the age of this tv series they should have all been released to DVD already, so unfortunately I doubt there will ever be a release of the rest which is a real shame.

In conclusion, this show will not disappoint novices or experienced home cooks alike - as one of the chefs say, you never stop learning about the art of cooking. If you're a fan of cooking shows, it doesnt get any better than this.",1308441600,8,2749,4.636550308008213
8335694,4,B001QIRSEQ,"I have pleanty of cook books for recipes to fill in what was left out of the video. The inspiration, techniques and different product usage made the video well worth not only watching but owning. There was no disappointment for me and it was exactly what I expected. For what it cost it was a great deal. Thanks ever so much!",1306972800,3,325,4.344262295081967
8335695,5,B001QIRSEQ,"This show was one of the cooking show that inspired me to try new things in the kitchen. Not all recipes are achievable for amateurs like me. I'm not going to buy black truffles, or cook a whole chicken for myself and making stock is not my cup of tea. But there is certainly enough a budding home cook can try.

I hope they bring out the other seasons on DVD.",1301443200,4,360,4.070422535211268
8335696,2,B001QIRSEQ,"When purchasing any kind of cooking video/lesson, you anticipate that recipes will be included with the lesson...  There were no recipes included, and these cooking videos were extremely disappointing.  As one of the other reviewers mentioned, the instructors are all very young chefs who are VERY fond of their cooking.  I did not learn anything and was not happy that I purchased these videos.",1275523200,15,395,5.140625
