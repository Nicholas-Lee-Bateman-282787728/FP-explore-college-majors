6478662,5,B00LAUMICM,"I bought it for my 7 year old and my son to watch on Halloween. It cost me 5 in Tesco's and did the job. We both enjoyed it. Don't understand what all the fuss is about. (Ok, I would not have paid 17.99 for it)",1351814400,,210,3.5869565217391304
6478663,1,B00LAUMICM,"I'm so tired of Dreamworks trying to make a quick buck with 30 minute DVDs, first strike was Kung fu panda dvd that came out after the movie and now this. horrible. just horrible.",1349222400,,179,4.294117647058823
6478664,3,B00LAUMICM,"I'm a fan of the Shrek franchised and enjoyed last year's DVD release of SCARED SHREKLESS. I thought SHREK'S THRILLING TALES might be more of the same. SHREK'S THRILLING TALES includes three cartoon shorts and one of them doesn't even involve anyone from the Shrek universe. The three shorts are:

""Night of the Living Carrots"" - This short doesn't feature anyone from the Shrek universe, but instead features the cast of MONSTERS VS. ALIENS. After the heroics in ""Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space"" the Monsters find themselves fighting off a horde of zombie carrots grown from the blood of the now defeated Mutant Pumpkins. The carrots turn anyone and anything they bite into a mindless zombie. B.O.B. is immune to their attacks and has to save the world.

""The Pig Who Cried Werewolf"" - This short features the Three Little Pigs and the Wolf. The Three Little Pigs return home after a night at the movies to discover they have a new next door neighbor. The Pig Who Built the Brick House is in a wheel chair with a broken leg and starts spying on their new neighbor. He's sure the neighbor is up to no good and tries to warn his brothers, but they don't believe him.

""The Ghost of Lord Farquaad"" - As Shrek and Fiona are preparing to leave on their honeymoon, Fiona is kidnapped and Shrek and Donkey race to save her. They are led to a cemetery and discover that the ghost of Farquaad is behind the plot. He couldn't be a king in life, so he plans to rule the underworld with Fiona at his side as his queen. While he prepares to throw Fiona over a waterfall, he sends a giant stone dragon to kill Shrek and Donkey. This ogre and his faithful steed never seem to get a break.

I enjoyed ""The Pig Who Cried Werewolf"" and even though it's not part of the Shrek universe, I liked ""Night of the Living Carrots,"" too. However, I've already seen THE GHOST OF LORD FARQUAAD before. It was originally a ride at Universal entitled SHREK 4-D and was later released on DVD as SHREK 3-D. Now it's been re-released here as filler. I wish there was another new Shrek short that was included, but there's not. It's rather disappointing as all of the shorts on SCARED SHREKLESS were entertaining. There are just so many great stories that could be told in a short format. Dreamworks should be pumping them out, but they aren't.

There really aren't any extra features on the DVD except for the usual trailers and the promos for several other animated Dreamworks projects (MASTERMIND, HOW TO TRAIN A DRAGON, etc.).

Overall, though ""The Pig Who Cried Wolf"" and ""Night of the Living Carrots"" are a blast, SHREK'S THRILLING TALES is a let down because over half of the disc is a re-release of SHREK 3-D, but under a different name.",1348358400,4,2713,4.5378323108384455
6478665,5,B00LAUMICM,"I wanted to collect halloween dvd's for my toddlers. I love this dvd and the stories are great. But I wish I would have waited to get the dvd that just came out with all of the 3 stories in one it is called ""DreamWorks Spooky Stories"". Since I purchased each one separately and it is a hassle exchanging each one from the dvd player.",1348099200,3,333,4.138461538461539
6478666,3,B00LAUMICM,"I thought this was going to be a new Shrek/Monsters vs. Aliens halloween special. The first two episodes are new. The pigs episode was ok, but not that great. The monsters vs. aliens episode was really good and would make this the only reason for buying this. The third episode, the Shrek episode, was a real let down. It is the Shrek 3D movie that came with the Story so far collection which included Shrek, Shrek 3D, Shrek 2, and a bonus disc. It is supposed to happen between Shrek and Shreknew 2. I really wish they could of put out something new. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the Monsters vs Aliens episode.",1346630400,10,632,4.319327731092437
6478667,4,B00LAUMICM,"This DVD contains three episodes:  The Night of the Living Carrots (Monsters vs. Aliens characters), The Pig Who Cried Werewolf, and The Ghost of Lord Farquad (both Shrek characters).  Kids (ages 4 & 9) both enjoyed these new episodes.  I'd also recommend the previous releases of Scared Shrekless & Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space (available in a combo pack) as short DVD treats for Halloween fun.",1346284800,8,420,5.057971014492754

6478688,5,B00LAUMICM,not what he wanted very short movie not worth the money and cheaper at target he loves shrek so it works all true but my kid loves it he is three i guess short is good.,1380240000,,168,3.6944444444444446
6478689,3,B00LAUMICM,I bought this for my 7 year old nephew and while I think this is on par with his age group I really didn't care for it.  Some of the jokes were a little crude and it really wasn't that funny.  There are four stories on the DVD and they were a lot shorter then I thought they would be.  I would recommend trying to rent it somewhere before you buy it.  I probably would not order it again.,1377561600,,388,3.8734177215189876

6478692,5,B00LAUMICM,I bought this movie for my kids to watch as they love shrek. These are cute little stories. My children have watched this over and over. I totally recommend this for all.,1359072000,,170,4.34375
6478693,5,B00LAUMICM,it was great for the children.  They have watched it several times. It is one of their favorites to watch.,1358380800,,106,4.3
6478694,5,B00LAUMICM,THESE MOVIES ARE FUNNY AND SILLY AT THE SAME TIME. THEY ARE NOT SCARRY FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES AND CRAZY FOR US OLDER FOLKS.,1356739200,,121,4.083333333333333
6478695,3,B00LAUMICM,"It was not worth the money. I bought this for our family and my three year old. she liked it okay, but thankfully it is not on the repeat 100 times a day list.",1355788800,,159,3.7058823529411766

6478697,3,B00LAUMICM,"These short films are probably best for ages 5 and up since there is a ghost and zombie carrots turning everyone into zombies. The Pig Who Cried Werewolf was cheesy, Night of the Living Carrots was great!, and The Ghost of Lord Farquaad...let's just say very strange, especially since it was made for 3D but you can't view it in 3D so it makes it look weird at times. These are VERY short ""short movies."" You're better of purchasing the new combo pack that was just released of ALL the Shrek & Monsters vs. Aliens Halloween movies (which includes this one) that are out called Dreamworks Shrek's Spooky Stories. It has Shrek's Thrilling Tales, Scared Shrekless + Thriller, and the new Monsters vs. Aliens Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space (the best out of all the shorts in my opinion!).",1351987200,,786,4.661870503597123
