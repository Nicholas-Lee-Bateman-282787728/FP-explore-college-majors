8613477,5,B00F9KCVUS,"This is a very interesting program which shows that the harpsichord is more versatile than many listeners might think and can do justice to more than just Bach, et al.  Vinikour and his instrument seem completely comfortable and at ease in this genre.  My first copy had horrible sound on the Blu-ray, and there were also numerous dropouts.  The company sent me a replacement and no problem, there must have been a defective run, as the sound on this one is perfect.",1424476800,,466,4.658536585365853
8613478,5,B00F9KCVUS,"This marvelous recording has earned Mr. Vinikour his second Grammy nomination in the category classical music for solo instrument.  The first, in 2013, was for his 2 cd set of J.P. Rameau's complete harpsichord works.  The two sets could not be more different; Rameau's works are traditional baroque, while this new work has a jazz like feel that captures 21st century music on an instrument that almost everyone associates with pre-Mozart composition.  Indeed, most current performers can't wait to abandon the harpsichord for a piano, thereby providing much greater flexibility in tone and color.  It is, therefore, quite refreshing and exciting that composers still write innovative music for the harpsichord and performers as talented as Mr. Vinikour are recognized for providing breathtaking interpretations of these ""new"" works..  The Grammy Awards will be announced in February; this performance is certainly worthy.",1420416000,2,923,5.564285714285714
8613479,5,B00F9KCVUS,"The catalyst that spurs innovation in most contemporary business methodologies is the element of discovery, and the same quality proves to be the impetus for many of the most meaningful musical experiences.  A great artist can of course lend enchantment and novelty to even the most hackneyed music, but the most memorable experiences in a music lovers life are those rare intersections of great artists with music that demands the full deployment of their talents.  TOCCATAS is just such an experience: a recording of 20th- and 21st-Century music for harpsichord by American composers, this discanother triumph of recording technology from Sono Luminusreveals every shimmering facet of harpsichordist Jory Vinikours formidable technique, which is already familiar to listeners who appreciate the more frequently-encountered Baroque repertory with which the harpsichord is associated.  That any release featuring Mr. Vinikour will preserve superb musicianship is a foregone conclusion, but playing of the quality heard on TOCCATAS is not to be taken for granted.  Likewise, it is no surprise that Mr. Vinikour transforms the harpsichord into an instrument capable of flights of rhapsodic expressivity as impressive as the daunting feats of virtuosity that are its more typical fare.  What may well surprise many listeners is that the harpsichord has retained, not least because of the advocacy of artists of the caliber of Mr. Vinikour, to whom three of the selections recorded here are dedicated, an important presence in contemporary composers work for the concert hall.  Spanning nearly six decades of contemporary American music for the harpsichord, TOCCATAS exemplifies the harpsichords status not as a relic of a distant past but as a fascinatingly vital instrument of endlessand timelesspossibilities.
