8259794,5,B0015T9A7O,"Unfortunately, there isn't a DVD movie for the 2nd Part (MORE STORIES OF PANCHO VILLA/MAS CUENTOS DE PANCHO VILLA), but we have this ""Pancho Villa y la Valentina"". It still follows the way of the 1st movie (THIS WAS PANCHO VILLA/ASI ERA PANCHO VILLA); the stories are really interesting and it really shows who Pancho Villa was. In all fareness, we should know more about him, and not just think he was a ""bandido"" or a bad guy, as History has shown, there is ALWAYS a reason for an action to take place, nothing happens just because...
Again, FULL SCREEN version and subtitles available as well.
VIVA VILLA!!!!!",1268265600,3,612,4.675925925925926
