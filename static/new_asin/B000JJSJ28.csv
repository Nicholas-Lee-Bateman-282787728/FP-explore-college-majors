Also -- I love that Franz Ferdinand ""Do You Want to"" single that closes each episode... perfect fit for the series.

If they could only make a sequel...",1223510400,,396,4.895522388059701
8151255,5,B000JJSJ28,A friend suggested that I check out this Anime and it is now one of my favorites. This series really was too short. I love it.,1207353600,,126,3.8846153846153846

Man, the series is entirely too short if you ask me, but being that it isn't as long and drawn out as other series, that makes you love it, and crave it so much more! Phenomenal.. Its an emotional rollercoaster, especially if youve seen the other 2 discs. I had to watch it twice over!! 10 STARS if I could give it that!",1203206400,,399,4.194805194805195
