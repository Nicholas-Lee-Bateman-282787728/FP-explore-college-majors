i have been an avid matlock fan for years. so, naturally i ordered seasons 1 thru 7 thinking
they would be all inclusive of all episodes.
much to my  dissapointment, not all episodes were included! some of which were my absolute favorie. Including episode involving fbi agent ed windgate and  another where cliff runs a triatholon.
and many others. where are they?
i am enjoying my seaesons 1 to 7.
sincerely,

4990756,5,B006IRQUDK,"Andy Griffith and his very talented co/stars gave us nine seasons of mystery with Southern comfort. Unfortunately,
only seven seasons have been released. The photography, stories, and the down home attitude of Matlock solving
the mysteries with his helpers who not only take us across America, but Europe too. You feel you are part of the
story and mentally help solve the mysteries and help convict the criminals in court. I wish that Matlock could have teamed up with J B Fletcher, Murder She Wrote, to do a mystery movie together. I highly recommend Matlock.
The 1970's, 1980's and early 1990's had some very good series and Matlock was one of the best. Andy Griffith
will always be remembered for his talent and the hours of enjoyment he gave us. Do hope seasons eight and nine
will be released soon.",1343433600,6,804,4.75

Andy Griffith up.",1365638400,,149,4.6923076923076925

4990761,5,B006IRQUDK,"I haven't seen all 7 seasons yet, but I'm really enjoying the ones I have watched. I love Andy Griffith, anything he was in, is a good movie. And I love Matlock. The two fit together perfectly. Outstanding series, and I'm glad I could get the whole series on DVD.",1358121600,,263,4.28
4990762,5,B006IRQUDK,I purchased this for my wife for Christmas.  She and i both like the Matlock shows and I saw this and knew it was for her.  We have already watched the first 2 seasons.  That is all we are doing.  I would recommend this to anyone who remotely likes the show.,1357344000,,258,4.0
4990763,4,B006IRQUDK,"My dad loves this series, and the set is as described. The only downsides are the price and the fact that we will eventually still have to buy seasons 8 and 9. I was also a little surprised that the set doesn't come in a box or anything; it's just each separate DVD shrink-wrapped into one chunk. I guess you have to pay a lot for excellence. Matlock always gets 'em!",1356912000,3,367,4.183098591549296
4990764,5,B006IRQUDK,Matlock was a brilliant actor. He will be truly missed....can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out..thanks for all the laughs and memories... You will be forever in my thoughts. He always solved the crime....,1354838400,,218,4.7631578947368425

8498761,4,B006IRQUDK,"I never watched Matlock much on TV. But, I like the Perry Mason TV videos, so, I took a chance. I found seasons 1-6 to be mostly very good, but, I could tell that, during Season 6, the writers were quickly running out of new ideas. In Season 6, the episode about most of the crew going to Las Vegas and Matlock getting hit on the head, passing out, and dreaming a whole cowboy-western show, was absurd and quite revealing.

In the Seventh Season  things really hit rock bottom. In one episode called ""Ghost,"" Matlock had to deal with a ghost throughout the entire episode. The absurdity is enough to make you want to toss your cookies.

Also, in the Seventh Season, almost the entire cast was changed. Matlock lived in a different home, his third, had no Downtown office, no prosecutor girlfriend, his lawyer-assistant had been replaced, and even the Fulton County Courthouse facade had changed. He had a different place to buy hot dogs.

I heartily recommend Seasons 1-5. But, don't waste your money on the later seasons.",1393459200,,1022,4.661111111111111
8498762,1,B006IRQUDK,"I'm a big fan of Matlock, so I was hoping for some quality DVDs of the original episodes. Instead, these looked like bad transfers from well-worn VHS tapes.  In addition, the episodes were edited, so significant scenes were missing.  My guess is that they used a second-generation version that had already been edited for TV to fit more commercials.  Why they couldn't restore the originals, like they've done with all the Perry Mason's and Hogan's Heroes and other older series is beyond me.  I would have paid for better quality.  Instead, I returned these.  Save your money!",1381363200,,577,4.896907216494846
8498763,4,B006IRQUDK,"I always liked and watch the repeats of the series Matlock. Now I have the first seven for myself to view anytime that I want. The package, as always, arrived within a few days and I am starting to view the contents.",1380585600,,216,4.166666666666667
