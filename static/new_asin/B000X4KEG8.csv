After I watched Nora Roberts' Montana Sky I knew from where the story has been taken.

Hub El Bannat is a remake of Nora Roberts' Montana Sky, minus the killings and murders parts! They made it more close to the Arabic culture, in any case I LOVE both movies a lot, and have them both on DVD.

Half-sisters (Three different mothers and one father ""Mustafa Abu Hagar) Nada, Ghada, and Rouaya ""Roka"" Abu Hagar are left their wealthy father's multimillion-dollar money and apartment, after his death. The only stipulation is that the girls will have to live with each other for a year.

Having never previously met, the three sisters, who have very different personalities, (Nada loves to cook and take care of others -  Ghada is sporty and edgy, always nervous and can't let anyone in - Roka is Half-English, Half-Egyptian who likes to have fun but feels lost) agree to the strange situation, despite having reservations about their forced family reunion. During their trial, the three girls fall in love, and realize that maybe their situation wasn't such a bad thing after all. They discover what family means, and how wonderful it is to have sisters. They start viewing their womanizer father differently, and even Ghada start missing him.

Nada returns to her school sweetheart Omar, Ghada marries the hottest guy in campus, the sporty Hazim, and Roka leaves the actor superstar Kareem and marries their family shrink Muheeb who tells the whole story, having been the shrink of the three girls.

8226872,3,B000X4KEG8,"This is a fairly interesting Egyptian romantic comedy. At times the sound and photography make it seem more like a movie from the 1960s, but at other times is seems like a decent modern movie. You get to see some Egyptian scenery and get a feel for everyday life for middle class types. The plot revolves around a psychiatrist who moves in next door to a woman whose father has died and left a fortune to his three daughters who are all from different mothers. The catch is that the girls who don't like each other must live together for a year to get the money. All three girls end up having problems with men that get resolved somewhat abruptly at the end. The major complaint I have about the movie is the subtitles. About halfway through the film, the subtitles start to lag the voices by a fair amount which makes it a little tougher to follow the action. If you are interested in an watchable Egyptian movie, this one isn't too bad.",1222992000,2,938,4.396551724137931
