8189512,1,B000P6R9MG,"This was just horrible. My friend had it and I thought, ""Armand Assante? Hey I liked him in Judge Dread and I The Jury"" well, this was straight to DVD garbage. It was only entertaining in how horrible it was... which I guess means it might be good for a few laughs if you are in to watching really bad movies. It is a foreign film and all the peoples names on the credits are all Russian or some eastern European country. The movie is dubbed except for Armand. The whole thing looks like it was written by a moron for morons. Don't even ask about the plot. It has to do with a gang of drug dealing Turks and some skin heads who hate them. Nobody can shoot and everybody is a joke. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is horrible and... well it is just horrible.

I stepped in dog poop once and I enjoyed that experience more than watching this movie. A good use for it, if you actually bought it, would be to use the DVD to scrape the poop from the bottom of your shoe and then you could throw it like a frisbee far far away.",1189382400,2,1026,4.079207920792079
