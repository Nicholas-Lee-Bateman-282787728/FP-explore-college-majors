3961830,5,B002OLT74S,"On the 22nd of September 2006, the United States Navy decomissioned the Grumman F-14 Tomcat after a total of 36 years of service from first take off to the last take off.  This video charts the basic history of the jet but more so covering the last carrier landings, last carrier take offs and the finally to the decomissioning ceremony before an overall look at their final resting place in the desert of Davis Monthan Air Force base in Tucson Arizona.

The best part about this very well documented footage is that it is presented and narrated by a former F-14 pilot and provides a very good insight into being a Tomcat pilot.

Also documented is the final operational days of the last F-14 Squadron at NAS Oceana, Virginia.

If you want to see raw footage of the final cats and traps of this very famous jet, then buy this dvd.  You will be entertained.",1282262400,17,856,4.496774193548387

8376140,5,B002OLT74S,"Great documentary about the ending of the great era of the Tomcats. It takes you from the beginning when the Tomcat was designed, through the test flights and upgrades that came later, and ends with the last catapult shot.",1393027200,,222,4.717948717948718
8376141,5,B002OLT74S,"Having a number of DVDs of the Tomcat I was leery of a new one that just hashed over all the previous ones. A pleasant surprise! This one will make you marvel, laugh, cry and be thrilled to be American. It's just simply amazing to watch an airplane that went into the fleet back in 1973 with VF1 and 2 that still sits at the top of the list of aircraft Russian and Chinese pilots least want to tangle with. Here is a plane that was still light years away from anything anyone has when it was uncerimoniously shown the door by Dick Cheney and Pentagon Politics! A brief reading of the Tomcats war exploits will show you exactly what the Pentagon was afraid of when it ditched the Tom for new aircraft that couldn't carry the Tomcats jock strap! An absolutley top notch addition to anyones aviation libarary.",1373328000,4,806,4.416107382550336
8376142,4,B002OLT74S,"A very nice F14 dvd for every Tomcat fan out there showing a little of the history of the airplane, achievements and the final ceremony on the last flight of the Tomcat in September 2006. Not a five star documentary because in my opinion I think they could've included the combat audio for the Mig 23 engagement and also the whole firing sequence of the Phoenix missile tests and at 66 minutes, it is too short for a Tomcat fan. Other than that it is worth buying it and having it in your collection.",1359417600,2,500,4.329787234042553
8376143,5,B002OLT74S,"The F-14 is probably my favorite military fighter aircraft. That being said, it's hard not to love a documentary dedicated to showing how great this plane is. I wish it was still in service. A must buy.",1359072000,2,202,4.486486486486487
