3620510,5,B001GU2EL6,"This is one of the greatest drawing instruction videos EVER!  None of the other instructional methods I have purchased have been as easy to do as this DVD!

They should start teaching kids to draw in this manner in grade school!  Then later on, teach them perspective, line, shading, etc.

It even has instructions on how to draw a female figure using a generic manikin.

Excellent stuff!",1328486400,14,388,4.731343283582089
3620511,4,B001GU2EL6,I admit this is very good to help you learn the proportions of the body. It gives an understanding of what you are actually drawing and teaches you how to see your results in steps. Great for beginners and intermediate. I would recommend it should someone ask me about it.,1321747200,4,272,4.46
3620512,5,B001GU2EL6,"I'm a high school art teacher.  In my Art II class, I teach how to draw the human body.  I have several manikins, but too expensive to buy for each student.  So, I was quite pleased when I saw this book.  With this, I'm able to project the diagram onto a screen for the entire class or simply demonstrate.  One thing that I find especially helpful is the fact that several different approaches are given--if one doesn't work for you, just try another.  Very easy to understand.",1311465600,14,477,4.425287356321839
3620513,5,B001GU2EL6,The pdf files are great. One of the best explanations of using a manikin along with anatomical knowledge to draw.,1285459200,5,113,4.7
3620514,5,B001GU2EL6,"I have been an artist for many years, and always thought that those ""artist manikins"" were just cute dolls; good perhaps for generalized gesture drawing, but not much else. I was therefore rather surprised to find this video that shows these manikins to be serious professional tools for figurative composition. Demonstrating in detail how a manikin can be used as an anatomical framework, Withers presents a remarkable method for the visualization of gestures, actions, and poses without the use of a model. A useful aid to any artists imagination, and a must have for any serious figurative artist.",1256515200,19,600,5.13265306122449

8307189,4,B001GU2EL6,The words and illustrations are very helpful.  It is good to know anatomy and how the muscles work together.  The manikin in the pictures were a bit out of proportion in the arms and legs.,1393545600,2,188,4.3428571428571425
8307190,5,B001GU2EL6,"An excellent mini course on figure drawing using an artist mannequin.  The author was entertaining and clear speaking. If you're wanting to learn how to draw people without taking a life drawing class, this video should definitely help.",1388620800,2,236,5.2105263157894735
8307191,5,B001GU2EL6,This is a helpful tool for artists young and old.  If you purchased a Manikin to pose for your figure painting this CD will help you to better understand how to use the Manikin to your best advantage.  I purchased this in addition to the Manikin from Amazon for my grandson who loves to draw.  My grandson says the CD makes it easier for him to understand the best way to use the Manikin.  This is a smart purchase.,1357776000,,415,4.215189873417722
8307192,5,B001GU2EL6,"This DVD is phenomenal!  The artist is brilliant both in his skill and presentation.  To top it off, the artist includes a male model that is handsomely built and toned.  Very, very beautiful male figure.  And oh, Manny the Manikin is cute, too.  This DVD is a must buy!",1340928000,4,270,4.428571428571429
