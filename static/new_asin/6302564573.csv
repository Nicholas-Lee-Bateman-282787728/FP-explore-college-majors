The trailer showed Luke Skywalker and that other famous guy, but thats only half the movie. . . because its basically two movies. The first part is interesting and has big stars; the second half is the most confusing thing youve ever seen with the real con man playing himself, and random people badmouthing him in some sort of interview. And just when you think (pray) that the movie is over, theres another 30 minutes left. Seriously, this movie starts out ok, then halfway through, all the famous people go away and you're left with a whole new cast playing the same characters. And the end certainly has a twist. Its so much of a twist, in fact, youll have no idea whats going on and youll have to go to Wikipedia for someone to explain why this movie is really two separate movies jammed together as one. Its really, really terrible.",1521676800,3,889,4.493827160493828
479318,5,6302564573,"Who can blame the teenage Barry Minkow for wanting a nice car, hot girlfriend, and nice things for his family. He was misguided and wouldnt have made the decisions he made if it wasn't for corrupt ADULTS leaching off him. Im not making excuses for him but he was a kid and didn't realize the consequences.

Adult Barry Minkow is like every other ex convict who trys to do good but cant escape his past so he embraces a life of crime.

Its seems like the FBI has a history of allowing criminals (who work for them) to continually get away with psychopathic criminal behavior. Some examples are
Crime boss James Whitey Bulger
Serial killer Scott Kimball
Mob under boss Sammy Gravano

Sad but good movie",1521244800,2,700,4.5396825396825395

479320,2,6302564573,"This is a biopic of Barry Minkow, a con artist who bilked people out of millions of dollars. It starts when he is 16 operating a rug cleaning business and shows him slowly becoming more and more criminal in a step process.

The problem with this crime drama is it is white collar crime with limited action. The screenplay didn't make it. Mildly interesting. Prison football scene that was the longest yarn. The film has many falling stars.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1520812800,3,476,4.654761904761905
479321,5,6302564573,My wife and I enjoyed this film greatly. We like entertaining and thought provoking movies that delve into the behavior of its characters. This film highlights the actions and thought processes of the charismatic con man Barry Minkow. His story is unique because it begins when he was still in high school and became the 'wonder kid' entrepreneur. It unfolds into a suspenseful story of a man trying to stay ahead of the consequences of past decisions. It is well acted and directed. From start to finish you will be hooked.,1520726400,,524,4.769230769230769

479323,5,6302564573,"Great movie and Ian McShane [Lovejoy Mysteries and Deadwood] star in this English thriller. He is very young and thin so it must
be one of his first movies and it's very 70's in some parts that kinda drag the movie but the story and action make up for that one
flaw. McShane is really good and should have done more parts like this. He's a con man that gets in over his head with some big
heavy weights and they are after him. It's a rare movie with McShane all of his fans should have in their collection.",1420761600,,506,4.121212121212121

7827431,2,6302564573,"The movie was barely ok, but worth watching just to familiarize yourself with Barry Minkow (the con man). It does not come even remotely close to covering the lifelong damage he caused to many individuals and the number of businesses, their customers, investors and employees. Do research on your own and youll have a much better idea of what I am saying. Minkow was and still is a chronic, unapologetic liar and a sociopath with absolutely no conscience. He would steal from anyone including his own family.

In fairness, I have to also say the fact that he suffers from a chemical imbalance may have everything to do with his behaviors. Again, if you read more about him you will understand.",1524182400,,693,4.7272727272727275

7827436,5,6302564573,"Just viewed this newly released film by Bruce Caulk. It's the true story about the life and times of Barry Minkow, a teenage fraudster who, in the mid-80s, ripped-off Wall Street for million$ and then went to prison. It's a great study in ego, downfall, resurrection, and then, lessons unlearned, further downfall. A compelling cautionary tale worth watching. The action details Minkow's emergence as the ""Whiz Kid"" (I was living in San Diego then; Barry truly got an AMAZING amount of press) of Los Angeles using systemic ill-gotten gains. Then, upon his release from prison, he becomes a very successful pastor for a large Christian church congregation in San Diego... a second story develops from there. Its a genuine miracle this film ever got released. The difficult multi-year production journey director Bruce Caulk had with Barry Minkow (and a host of other characters) should be made into a case study for film schools; the backstory of the making of Con Man is truly worthy of its own feature. If there was an Academy Award for Professional Courage and Perseverance in the face of insurmountable challenges beyond ones control, Con Man Director Bruce Caulk would win it hands-down. Bruce is a highly creative, on-time/on-budget, seriously committed director. There are some great scenes in this film. Pay attention to Mark Hamill's eyes and facial reactions... they're brilliant, as is Talia Shire's bathroom scene as Barry's concerned mother, and Armand Assante is very credible as a Mafia boss. The other veteran actors in the cast turn-in solid performances, as well. And Justin Baldoni absolutely captures the zeitgeist of Minkow as ZZZZ Best Carpet Cleanings Founder and CEO. Bravo to Bruce Caulk, the cast, and the crew for finally getting Con Man out for release. For reasons that will become self-evident in the story, this film, essentially, had to be flipped on its head after it was originally in the can. Enjoy the memorable ride",1522454400,,1951,5.080996884735202

The fact that actual people associated with the main character were brought in to share their point of view and that we got to see at some point the real Con Man playing himself (the nerve on that guy! :) , that format made the movie more interesting to me as it gave me a better feel for the actual person and satisfied my curiosity... The movie feels entertaining and educational at the same time. It's always intriguing to get a glimpse into the mind of con men and their thinking. Great job!",1521676800,,578,4.411214953271028
