2849188,5,B000QX0LE6,"This is the saddest movie I've ever seen.  Phoenix's somber voice and the tragic, graphic images and music make for a very surreal experience while watching this documentary.  It is saddening but ultimately it is determined and you will come away feeling the need to make a change for justice and equality between our close-knit earthlings.",1187308800,103,340,5.053571428571429
2849189,5,B000QX0LE6,"The movie starts with a warning for those with weak stomachs about disturbing graphic images. This is not an idle caution, at least 60 minutes of this 95 minute film would be enough to ruin anyones lunch. The film is broken into five subject sections above and beyond the intro and recap: Pets, Food, Clothing, Entertainment, Science. If you are too tenderhearted to see the gore or want to show this film to children, try watching the first and last 15 minutes of the film.

Philosophically the message of the movie mimics a quote from ""The Outermost House"" by Henry Beston who wrote, ""We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature, and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creatures through the glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren; they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of the earth.""",1186012800,104,1438,4.775100401606426
2849190,5,B000QX0LE6,"It would be easy for a review to focus entirely on this documentary's visuals.  For they are overwhelming.  I suspect some persons even would scorn the documentary for ""subjecting"" us to these images, at least so many of them.  But I think this would be misguided.  For, with only a few exceptions, the documentary does not use its images in a way that's sensationalist.  They merely document the conditions to which many animals are subjected.  The problem, I think, is that we -- as a society -- actively avoid looking at any images documenting our treatment of unwanted pets, animals raised for meat, animals used for entertainment (e.g., circus), and animals used in experiments.  Given this, Earthlings is simultaneously overwhelming and overdue.  By itself, this is enough to recommend watching the film.  However, the documentary is much more than this.  Its creators obviously are attempting to provoke us to think.  This is apparent within the first minute, as its prologue introduces its viewers to core moral principles that have defined the animal liberation movement.  And it does this wonderfully.  Its ability to articulate these principles clearly and concisely would make this film great supplemental material for any course covering its topics (I plan to show Earthlings in my community college applied ethics class when it examines Peter Singer's ""Animal Liberation."")  This prologue frames the film's visuals as they document our treatment of unwanted pets, animals raised for meat, animals used for entertainment, and animals used in experiments.  It does this so well that rarely does a minute pass without the film challenging us to question some of the fundamental assumptions seemingly guiding our present treatment of these animals.  This point is punctuated at the film's end, which challenges us to rethink our understanding of animals, our relationship to them, and our co-existence on earth.  In the end, the film is provocative in the best sense I can image.  It does not merely ask us to memorize its concepts.  It beautifully immerses its philosophical content within its medium (Through the wonderful harmony of its visuals, Moby's subtly haunting music, and Joaquin Phoenix's minimalist, yet impassioned narration) in a way that challenges us to rethink how we live our lives.  Many are likely to be disturbed by this challenge (As a life-long meat eater, I understand how difficult it can be to respond to this challenge).  But it is doing nothing more or less than educating us!  While the film is not perfect, and it does seem to be guilty of some pseudoscience -- especially with its seemingly hyperbolic denials of the knowledge acquired through vivisection -- those of us who are saddened by the educational opportunities missed each and every day on television and film are likely to find Earthlings an inspirational reminder of such media's educational capacities.",1184457600,203,2907,5.179871520342612
2849201,4,B000QX0LE6,"Let me start first by being honest here, this documentary did not ""turn me vegan"" as some other reviewers have stated.  It didn't turn me vegetarian either.  In scripture, we are given dominion over the animals of the earth.  But, I'm pretty sure what we're doing today is not what our Creator had in mind.  This film did affirm the feelings I've had for a long time that I no longer want to support ""factory farming"".  We live in a rural area and have the land to raise our own livestock, and do it in the right way for them, for us, and as stewards of the land itself.  If I'm going to eat meat, and prepare it for my children, and I will, (look, just keeping it real, folks) I can at least insure that the lives of the animals in our care were good ones and that their end was humane and compassionate and carried out with dignity.  That is the very least we can do.

I'm not much of a leather wearer, I'm sure some of our shoes have leather uppers, and they were most likely purchased second hand (reduce, reuse, recycle) and I've never owned, nor wanted to own a ""fur"" in my life.  How ridiculous has always been my thought on that matter.  I don't go to circuses, or zoos, or fairs for the reasons stated in the film.  As to the ""scientific"" research, there are no words.

Our animals, our pets, are all spayed or neutered, or in the case of my horses, gelded because there's no need to perpetuate the over population problem and it's a simple fix.  Our dog, cat, and horses were given to us, or found their way to us (our little cat who showed up hissing and spitting at our dog and fit in the palm of my hand.  I had to feed her with a dropper for days as she hadn't any teeth).  They receive proper vet/farrier care and have their annual check-ups, just like my little human children.  :)  In short,  I feel it's my responsibility and privilege as their owner to give them the best life possible.  Can we not do the same to the animals that wind up on our dinner plate?  I think so.  Let's not forget that when corporations won't listen to our voices, they sure start paying attention when we speak with our pocketbooks and our words begin to affect their bottom line.",1470268800,,2177,4.248175182481752

2849203,3,B000QX0LE6,"I gave it three because as a vegan christian, I understand that there is cruelty in the meat industry and I'm against torture of animals. I have a soft spot. In the bible it gives an illustration when a man beats his donkey, and God allows the donkey to speak and say ""Why are you beating me ?"" However, the bible specifically states that God put animals here for food and clothing. Animal sacrifice was very common. And God even ordered it. It was actually a symbol for what the son of God did for us. He went through a sacrifice to save us. Also, I have done my research and have found that many vegans including Celebrities (Ellen) who are against the meat industry support abortion. To me that's twisted because God puts more value on a human life than he does for species lower than us. Animals feel pain but they don't comprehend death so I think if we do kill an animal for food than we need to make it as pain free as we can. I don't eat animal products because I actually feel better and I love the benefits. I have more energy. I'm not against someone that does though. I'll still buy leather. I'm not doing it for religious reasons because I'm a follower of God's word and If God put them here for consumption than I'm gonna be like-minded with him.",1464134400,,1260,4.298319327731092

My family became vegan as a result of viewing this film and we have never felt healthier, happier, or more connected to animals.

We ARE ALL Earthlings...yet humans tend to forget that.  If something doesn't change, and quickly, we will not have an earth that is habitable.

2849228,3,B000QX0LE6,"The most compelling aspect about this film is the footage it presents - no one can deny the abuses and violence so starkly depicted. Whether you are a 3-meals-a-day carnivore, fashionista with a collection of leather and fur accessories, or the biggest tree-hugging environmentalist vegan, the video seen in Earthlings will force you to seriously re-evaluate your place in the tapestry of life on planet Earth. I would be shocked to meet someone who didn't in some way alter their everyday habits in response to this documentary, whether that means cutting down/eliminating meat consumption, no longer attending animal shows/ performances, or donating to an environmentalist cause.

With all this said, there are major flaws which weaken the documentary's narrative and at some points give it a preachy air that doesn't feel palatable to someone who isn't the most die-hard animal rights supporter. The documentary does a poor job of appealing to skeptics who believe that these abuses are out of the ordinary or blown out of proportion to fit the agendas of animal rights/environmentalist groups. These flaws include:

-- Not directly citing where footage was shot, when, and by whom. Joaquin Phoenix narrates the documentary, and will sometimes cite these details but often will not. I was already aware that these conditions are rampant from other sources, but if this was the first time I had ever heard of such abuses, I know I would not be fully convinced from Earthlings alone.
-- No interviews with individuals - I saw so many opportunities for former undercover journalists, former factory farm workers, researchers, regulators, activists, and so on to share their knowledge and experiences and help build the documentary's case. Alas, no, there are only sweeping generalizations and quotes of major philosophical/literary figures spoken by Phoenix.
-- Limited specific facts - Again, because I have read other sources, I had some background knowledge that led me to believe most of this documentary was true. But the documentary makes no attempt to convince a skeptical viewer.

Overall, these serious flaws prevent the documentary from being accessible to and persuading a broader audience, which is critical if we ever hope to change the way humans relate to animals and consume animals. The raw emotional power of the footage seen is its greatest asset, but the documentary creator did little to build a more comprehensive and convincing case beyond that.",1427414400,19,2468,5.2272727272727275

I had been vegan for years before seeing this, but thought it was important--as a member of this Earth--to further expose myself to the the horrors of ""civilization"".  This film made me physically ill, and I cried through most of it; it is, simply, soul-crushing.  That humans are capable of such desensitization, that it is done to appease our unnecessary appetites, and that there are those who remain unaffected by these atrocities...well, it is difficult to have hope for humanity upon viewing.

When you watch this film, take deep breaths and remember that these horrors are not sustainable.  A single person may not be capable of eliminating the all the evils displayed, but they are in control of their individual participation in them--we have the power to choose what we support and condone.

I have made it my life's mission to understand the consequences of my actions, and through that understanding endeavor to make some sort of positive difference in an exquisitely troubled world.  With films like these, my awareness is increasingly expanded, and I am able to alter my actions accordingly. It is my hope that this particular film continues to inspire others to make the necessary changes to be a conscientious member of this Earth.

Life--all life--is precious; after you view this film, in the days and years that follow, please do not forget that.  Remember the images that repelled you, the emotional response that overwhelmed you, and try your best to make this treasured planet a less cruel world.",1411084800,10,1609,4.951672862453532

That was four years ago. The reason I'm commenting on this documentary, is because my brother and his wife watched it almost two years ago. Guess what?? They are now vegetarians too. My brother told me about this film, but I didn't need to have these images in my mind to wake up.

I've learned that there's a whole world out there of delicious vegetarian recipes, and I can't say I miss eating meat. It's good to know you're not participating in the suffering of these farmed animals. I especially like the fact that my dollar doesn't go to the evil, sadistic people who choose to treat a living creature like this. I'm only sorry I didn't separate myself from this a long time ago.

I am also a Christian, and I shutter when I hear fellow Christians laugh about eating animals.

It is the right of every child to feel secure and this film would deeply undermine the innocence and joy that all children are entitled to, especially since they have a natural affinity for animals and identify with them.  Parents, grandparents and guardians, by all means watch Earthlings and by your joyful example teach the children in your care respect for all beings.

every organism feeds but to raise animals with no concern for their quality of life, and to slaughter them with no concern for their quality of death, makes us monsters. we are a species only we ourselves could love. perhaps one day we'll change but unfortunately I see little evidence of it. all the animals that we have murdered, painfully, cruelly, some spitefully; it makes you wonder if there is a god, if one species can cause such harm to so many others.

I don't hate us but I feel we should be bigger spirited, more generous in nature. we celebrate our intelligence, our achievements, yet we care so little for other animals that we skin them alive without even bothering to put them out of their misery. how does that make us the higher, more advanced species? how does that make us anything but the most evil bully, if we will not even bother to commit to a minimum quality of life and minimum quality of death for the animals we eat.

If it weren't for the music, I'd give this film four stars. But because of the annoying non-stop music, a point has to be made. Manipulation at its finest.

I don't go around preaching, but when peopel ask me why I don't support the circus, or why I am a vegan, I tell them to watch this movie.  I cant tell you how many times people mock me for my eating ( I didn't realize that eating a plant based diet is somehow ""girly"" or ""gay"").  Most of the people in my like say they don't care to watch this, or that they don't need to see it, animals are here for us to eat, blah blah.  I think the negative attitude that I sometimes experience from people though, is because they know that it is wrong, but they don't have the discipline to change.  By no means do I claim to be better or more moral than anyone else, but I just cant comprehend watchign this, and it not changing you.  I know its not easy, especially the eating aspect, but their is just no justification to treat animals the way we do.  If peopel want to say that they don't care about animals, thats one thing, but when people claim to love animals, but still eat them, or go to circuses, I really wish they would just sit down and watch this.

My mind keeps replaying all the suffering and torture that those animals went through, all for the sake of feeding, clothing and entertaining us. I feel sick to my stomach. This movie has definitely pushed me to become vegetarian, maybe even vegan. I used to come up with all kinds of excuses as to why I should continue eating meat like, ""It can't be that bad everywhere"", or ""It's a necessary evil"", or ""Other animals eat animals"", or whatever. It sickens me how people justify it, how I used to justify it. Just because we are more intelligent does not mean animals are ""beneath"" us and it certainly doesn't give us a right to abuse them. If people want to eat meat, go ahead, I won't stop anyone. Although, it would help, even just a little, to consider buying meat that you know was killed humanely, like from local farms.

This documentary opened my eyes, not just to the suffering of animals, but it makes me question, how much is going on right under our noses? How many people, how many children, are living under cruel conditions? There is much that we turn a blind eye to.

It is quite eye opening as to the extent of disturbing practices we commit against animals on a daily basis in various industries. But also extremely graphic. Far more so than Food Inc.

Unfortunately it comes with the agenda of turning people to Veganism.

Because of this I would personally classify it a ""propaganda film"" instead of ""just a documentary"". But still worth watching.",1354492800,5,455,4.9605263157894735
2849276,5,B000QX0LE6,"I'm already vegan but I got a copy of the dvd free at a vegfest so I thought I'd watch it. I'm glad I did because I recommend this dvd to many people now.

I really like how the dvd is set up. They go over all aspects of how animals are used in society, from food, to entertainment, science, clothing, and as ""pets"". Nothing is idyllic as you'd think.

I remember when I was younger going into a leather jack and fur store, and my parents bought me a soft rabbit coat. I thought they only shaved off the rabbits fur (which still wouldn't be too fun for the rabbit) because there was no way I could have believed such cruelty I saw in this video to be behind such actions such as the fur trade. I donated it when I became a vegan, and even though as a vegan I already knew about much of the fur trade industry, I think that seeing it was more so shocking and really made me more passionate and grounded in my decisions. One image of this documentary still haunts me. The fur of a live mink is ripped off of it, alive, and you can see its blinking. (I have heard I'm not the only one who remembers that scene most.)

I already had seen many videos of slaughterhouses and animal testing, so much of the stuff here wasn't new to me, but it was good to know. In some ways I think it was more graphic, but like I said, I'm glad I choose to watch it, because being able to see it makes me more passionate and motivated to get active and speak out for these animals.

PLEASE WATCH THIS. It's incredibly important and oh, so powerful. If you think this will disturb you. It will and it should. Please do not turn away. Staying in blissful ignorance will NOT help these animals. There is a quote ""We must not refuse to see with our eyes, what they must endure with their bodies."" ~Gretchen Wryler Your actions have the power to help these animals. The choices you make in not supporting these industries help these animals. It really is that simple. Everyone wants a better world for all beings, but few actually want to BE the change to make that type of world.

Reading other reviews I think you get the idea of what this film is about and how intense and graphic the reality of our relationships with our fellow ""earthlings"" are. We see ourselves as humans, on a higher plane of existence and that may be true but if we are on a higher plane we must certainly have the most control over the planet. Shouldn't we treat other animals as their guardians and protectors and not continue to be inhumane murderers and torturerers of the defenseless?. This is the question this film poses. Some reviewers ask what can we do about these atrocities and I can only say that being a consumer, especially in the U.S., is our most powerful tool for change. Watch this movie and make your own decisions on how to lead your life from that point on. You may want to make some small changes at first and then work towards a life that is in unity with our fellow ""Earthlings"".

i knew that 'earthlings' is the big one. the big, tough, raw, exposing mamma jamma of the entire lot and after a more recent REAL change to a vegan lifestyle (for the right reasons), i decided to watch this movie so i could have my reasons burned into my brain and heart forever. even though at every turn i was bawling my eyes out and found myself apologizing out loud to the poor souls that i was watching suffer for humankind's greed.. i forced myself to watch the entire movie. on several occasions i did have to turn away because they truly were too much for me to stomach.. but i always went back. i went back and i made myself finish the entire film because i wanted to ensure that i never EVER choose selfishness over selflessness again in my life. it haunted me deeply and shook me to my core. i referred this movie to my mom who was also on the fence about what she likes the taste of and what is right ethically. she immediately converted to a vegan lifestyle and we are working together as a support system towards doing everything we possibly can to make a positive mark on the world.

this movie is no joke. it's devastating and real. but it's important to be aware of what is going on behind closed doors to our fellow earthlings because they don't have a voice nor do they have rights to a life free of suffering and pain.

But the confusion comes up from the fact that we use and abuse animals, no questions asked, and that, at the same time, we feel very open minded and liberal to finally  accept and respect all the different kinds of people. The socially accepted line is drawn between humans and animals. But this line is arbitrary and therefore confusing.

One moment you're marveling at these captivating, affectionate, intelligent creatures in their natural surroundings; next, you're seeing them abused and slaughtered in ways so cruel and vicious as to defy imagination.  And the perpetrators are pure evil, often laughing and taunting the animals as they slay them. Killing is bad enough, but to do it in ways that inflict intentional, severe, unspeakable pain and prolonged suffering is despicable. Yet, that's how the products of such treatment (meats) get to our markets.

Thanks to Shaun Monson, Joaquin Phoenix, Persia White, Maggie Q, and others, Earthlings eloquently, but simply tells the story. Nothing pedantic nor pretentious. No melodrama, hyperbole, or preaching; just plain facts, with images to back them up.  Monson's writing and direction are masterful.  Phoenix's narration, flawless.

A nice, if painful, surprise was Monson including all species in his definition of abuse.  Wasn't expecting clips of ""human abuse,"" depicting the holocaust, segregation, etc. The message was clear:  We are all earthlings.  We all come here with an innate desire to avoid pain and to LIVE.

Imagine your loving, devoted dog having his tongue ripped out; his throat slit; his legs and tail cut off--all without anesthetic.  Just because he was born a dog.  Imagine living immersed in fecal matter and toxins.  And when you die, it's either a slow, excruciating death or a fast, violent one.  Just because you weren't born human.

What if you were beaten because you wouldn't follow commands you don't even understand?  That's what happens to animals with the circus, fair, rodeo and other venues who've been trained to provide ""entertainment.""  And ""trained"" is a misnomer; what they've really been is ""abused,"" beaten into submission. From Earthlings, I learned it takes no bravery to ""fight"" and kill a bull or ride a bucking bronco that's been drugged, mishandled, frightened, and disoriented.

NOTHING tastes good enough for me to knowingly support the meat industry.  Yes, ""Earthlings"" is hard to watch, but would be even harder to live. I owe it to these creatures is to learn about their suffering and spread the word as best I can.  My thanks to Monson, White, Phoenix and company for putting the story out there.

There are No words to describe this Documentary, but it will (without a doubt) change your View on what you eat. In the Film, we are shown our relationships with animals, broken down into 5 sections; Pets, Food, Entertainment, Clothing, and Research. You really do have to see it to get an idea of the emotion and message. I could type about this subject (regarding our food, the industry, the health aspect, etc) all day long but what good would do that do? I ask that you, as the viewer watch it; and the best part is--you do not have to go and buy it, just go to the Earthlings website and watch it for Free. Though I must caution, this film is not for the weak of heart and I strongly advise you to refrain from showing this to your children or any elder. It is very graphic, but it's real--this is the reality that McDonalds and other Food Corporations will never show you. My Personal Experience, summary: I never thought that I'd be the victim of such an impact. To the point that it would almost make me feel sick with myself and the actions of my fellow humans. I never thought the reality of the industry, which most of us participate in, involved such brutality and cruelty. I wasn't expecting anything major from this Documentary, I watched it as a meat-eater (ignorant of the suffering that was put onto my plate) and after I watched it, I was so upset that I couldn't consume meat afterwards, it just lost its flavor to me and I became a vegetarian (I am now a Vegan). This film not only made me me cry (and I'm not ashamed to admit it) it also had one heck of an impact. It hit me like a tsunami of bricks, my very existence suddenly seemed so cruel and bloody. Sure it was painful to watch it, but I'm glad that I did, because now my perception of where my food [used to] come from is no longer this fantasy, grassland where Farm Animals are just singing and dancing. I'm awake now, my blinders are off--I have a sense of reality again. In short; Just watch it, Make the Connection. It will change your World.

That movie was a story about a man willing to spend a lot of money to find the last & lost copy of another rare movie called ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"" of which all the legal copies were destroyed because it was leading people into homicidal riot and self destruction by cutting and mutilation etc. While this movie (Cigarette burns) don't show any significant part of that lost movie I am guessing that lost movie called ""La Fin Absolue du Monde"" would be a french version of ""Earthlings"". That's exactly how it will make you feel about humanity and yourself.

You will question the existence of god or his threshold limit. I hope there is no god, because if there is one we are doomed. If I were to list the worst things that happened on this earth, before I watched this movie, I would have said 'the holocaust', but after watching this movie I think the worst thing that happened on this earth is us.

I have set myself a goal to show it to as many people as I can. A film like this has obviously not been made for making money, I wonder why they could not reduce the price on this DVD so people can buy tens of copies to distribute.

People with depression should avoid this movie.

Its forever changed my view and the way i want to eat. Its not just a graphic film  telling you to lay off meat, because Ive seen those, No this film touched me on a deeper level. Its message beautiful- that in the end it doesn't come down to strength,intelligence,social class or civil rights but pain and suffering and what we can do to minimize them regardless of race,sex, or species because we are connected.we are all earthlings. It not easy to watch and for most parts i cried for the animals and the pain they must have experienced but in the end i believe that anyone who has ever bought any animal products has an obligation to watch this film. No one is telling you how to live your life, you don't have to be vegan, but you should know the results of your choices and whats left in your wake. You need to watch so you can know its not okay to treat other being this way and demand it be better and/or not at all because no one deserves to die that way. nobody. I'm glad they don't hold back in this film because it doesn't need to be sugar coated it already has been people need the cold hard facts of the evil thats going on and we need to know, need to feel again, we need to get connected.

2849298,5,B000QX0LE6,"I went vegan about a month ago after watching a pretty gruesome video about slaughterhouses. I'd heard Ellen Degeneres recommend Earthlings as a life-changer and knew I should watch it, but dreaded seeing it. I thought, ""If that short video I saw before tore me up so much, will I ever recover from a one and a half hour video full of similar footage?"" Finally yesterday, I decided I'd just watch it in five-minute increments, day by day. On the first five-minute day, I watched the whole thing, finger on the pause button ready to strike. But I couldn't turn away. Even though I was bawling like a baby at some scenes while simultaneously yelling at the people in a scarily feral voice, ""How can you DO that? What are you doing? How can you DO that?? Oh my god!!"" I was still thankful to have seen what I saw. It gave me an energy and purpose I hadn't felt before. Before was just guilt and powerlessness. That sense of purpose lit a fire in me to push myself to be an integral part of ending the suffering.

I immediately wrote to Ellen Degeneres and thanked her for having the courage (along with so many) to speak out about the unspeakable acts that give ""humanity"" a very bad and sick name. But I also told her that I feel very positive that thanks to people like her, and people now like me, we can end this. I feel truly in my heart that this movement is starting to snowball. I love that glamorous superstars and athletes are speaking out about this, because it's making people take notice and stop and consider before they bury their necks in the sand, as I have done most of my life with the encouragement of those around me.

Every since I was little, I felt that killing animals was just wrong in every sense. Even though I ate meat, I constantly had this nagging haze over my head knowing something was very off and that I wasn't aligned with my principles. Up until very recently I bought leather and reasoned that the animal was killed for meat anyway. (How wrong was I?) It is easy to turn the other way. But the peace that comes with finally facing what you knew to be wrong and changing your life so that you no longer contribute to the harm? So priceless and wonderful, like my soul finally settled where it was supposed to go. We drove through by fields of cows the other day and I looked at them and thought, ""I will never harm you again.""

My greatest gratitude goes to the undercover activists who went secretly filmed these scenes -- your courage floors me. I don't know how you did it but I'm grateful you did. And to the people who created the film: what an incredible gift to the animals and the world. I just want to save and enfold those animals that died and are dying now into a world that dignifies them.

2849303,5,B000QX0LE6,"Earthlings is narrated by Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix, who shares with us the harsh realities of man's five dependencies on animals. Food is an obvious one of them. The other four are clothing (leather and fur), companionship (cats and dogs), entertainment (zoos and circuses), and scientific experimentation. It's a film we should all watch at least once as it serves as a powerful reminder of the routine abuses of animals.
The images of factory farming and dolphin slaughtering are disturbing and not for those with weak stomachs. The gas chambers used to euthanize unwanted cats and the skinning of live animals for their fur are shocking. But perhaps most troubling images were those of the people performing the morbid tasks of abusing animals for no other point than entertainment. I've known about the debeaking of chicks and the castration, tail-docking and ear-clipping of pigs for a while and those images are part of what turned me veg, but after seeing what happens behind the scenes at circuses, I can unequivocally say that I will never, under any circumstance, go to a circus ever again.

Due to the nature of the film, people come away from it with an OMG reaction which is what the documentary was going for, but relies on emotion more then facts. Throughout the film, they say that these are the norm, however many times they will show other countries, now if people live here and support the AR movement then cool, however I can't help what another country does to it's animals, we have enough trouble trying to do it for humans. Now that isn't to say you shouldn't care, I simply believe that they presented the worst situations, said they were the norm (perhaps because they went only to bad farms?), and the solution given wasn't to improve conditions it was to not eat meat at all.

Now, the computer industry isn't exactly good for the environment (even through recycling), but are you going to give up your computers or would you rather improve the industry? Just saying.

If you want to get someone interested into caring for animals who doesn't, this is a good doc., but it should be used more for informing on the worst not a reason to change your diet.

If you think that killing animals is equal to murdering humans you will likely disagree with me, however it isn't about you reaffirming what you already believe in, its about trying to get people to care. People will disagree with you, and this film (as they should) but it shows that we do need to improve how we treat animals.

I am so pleased that I saw this film. Everyone should. I mean, we all know (for example) that 25 million unwanted pets are killed each year. But until I saw Earthlings, I had never seen an animal put to sleep (a euphemism that should be permanently banned). It does something to your soul, watching a beautiful dog being caressed while injected and dying within seconds in the arms of a human it trusts. And then watching the next one. And the next. And the next... And then watching the carcasses being tossed into a pickup truck.

The film lays out man's inhumanity to animals in a very matter-of-fact way. Nothing is sensationalized. The viewer is merely witnessing the way things are done. This makes the callousness with which the animals are treated in the food industry segment all the more disturbing.

My family and I have decided we will no longer support this barbaric process. We  will only buy meat from a home grown farm where we know what the animal eats, how they live and, most importantly, how the animal dies. And if we can't do that, we  will live without meat. We will not starve, there is plenty of food other then meat. It has been three weeks and I still can't get the visions of the treatment of these animals out of my thoughts.

I watched an animal being skinned alive and stared into the eyes of its living, breathing carcass of inside out skin, its raw flesh surely on fire... I wished upon all that is holy that it wasn't true.  How could you, how could anyone be that cruel?

I am not a rabid animal rights activist, and I am a supporter of hunting as long as meat is eaten hy humans in this world, as I believe at least animals killed in the wild were given the opportunity to live their own life...

With that being said... I am on the verge (grappling with myself and my personal love for good tasting meat) of giving up meat products because of the treatment standards being practiced.  I have studied some of this at my university before, but I suppose until now it has not really hit home.  Bravo for printing these images in my mind, as it is true a picture speaks a thousand words.  Maybe it took this long to realize what my personal impact really is.

Would I recommend this movie? Without question!  I would show my children, my friends, my enemies and my pets this movie.  I have been encouraging any and all to see the movie.

2849330,5,B000QX0LE6,"This film isn't a conspiracy theory. It's not some weird, skewed perspective on how animals are treated on a daily and hourly basis. It's a harsh, open-eyed presentation of facts, and the facts are horrifying. Phoenix narrates a broad array of footage detailing homo sapiens appalling mistreatment, torture, and slaughter of animals. The footage is often difficult to watch, and some images will stay with you for a long, long time. This is the first time, for instance, that I have seen footage of a live skinning of a dog in China. Words can't describe my visceral and emotional reaction to this, but it should be seen. As Phoenix says, quoting Ralph Waldo Emerson: ""You have just dined, and however scrupulously the slaughterhouse is concealed in the graceful distance of miles, there is complicity.""

This film offers footage that most people would rather not see, and rather not contemplate. But, as the saying goes, ""we must not refuse to see with our eyes what they must endure with their bodies."" _Earthings_ presents a straightforward record of our daily, appalling mistreatment, murder, and exploitation of animals--for food, for entertainment, for so-called science, most importantly for MONEY. Everyone who benefits, perhaps unknowingly, from this cruelty should watch it, and judge for themselves.

2849332,5,B000QX0LE6,"Earthlings shows things no sane human wants to watch, things that make you wince, that make your heart shrivel, that leave you feeling drained and stupefied at the horrors perpetrated on a daily basis for nothing more than satisfying the interests and tastes of individual homo sapiens. Many may describe this as a film about animal rights, but the subject is not so much animals as it is humans, not so much about rights as it is the struggle to live compassionately.

Earthlings opens by laying out its assumptions, beginning with the premise of specieism, a variation on the human habit of assigning heightened moral value to isolated features of our own species, such as race, nationality, or sex. In asserting special rights, humans justify the treatment of animals - as they have done with women or certain ethnic groups - as creatures of less value, less worthy of respect, as in fact not creatures at all but property.

The filmmakers proceed to look at five ways in which animals serve humans: as pets, food, clothing, entertainment, and research subjects. There is a narrative of sorts, but the of images of cruelty and horror tell the real story, a story of suffering on a scale so unimaginable it is overwhelming. Even more disheartening is that much of this suffering is caused not because people are starving, or naked, or without other means of enriching their lives, but because we like the taste of flesh, we like the feel of leather, we like the thrill of the hunt. This is suffering caused for nothing more than fulfillment of sensual desire.

I have been a vegetarian for nearly two years, dating back to my first six-month visit to Nepal, a country with low sanitation standards. I stopped eating meat for health reasons. I was not and have not been an animal rights activist, though I do have a great fondness for and interest in animals. I came to this film with an open mind and heart; I now feel traumatized. I don't blame the filmmakers for this. They have simply shown me what is and made me aware of things I ignored. As the filmmakers point out, it's not so much that these truths are hidden. Most of us prefer not to see them.

Consider this. Earthlings officially premiered in 2005, which means it has been in circulation for at least three years. But if you google a search string of [earthlings review] you will find most returns are from sites about vegetarianism or animal protection. No reviews from major media or major critics, despite the fact that the producers (without the help of a distributor) put the film in a number of theaters in order for it to be considered for an Academy Award nomination. At the internet's two largest movie databases, IMBD and Rotten Tomatoes, the latter has no listing at all, the former no links to external reviews.

If you are prepared for an emotional and intellectual challenge and can withstand the pain of seeing animals, while still alive, having their throats slits, being burnt, beaten, electrocuted, shot, or gassed, then you might like to view or purchase a copy of the film here. A streaming version good for one week is available for US$2.99.

  ""Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless. All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.""

I only got about 15 minutes in (to the part where they threw a live dog bleeding profusely into the back of a garbage truck) and I had to turn it off as I was in tears.  I couldn't make myself watch any more.  How can the human race allow this kind of cruelty to happen?  Humans as a species are nothing but selfish, savage animals that only use the other species for their own benefit with no care or concern about the pain they cause.  Aren't we supposed to be the smartest species on the planet?  How about acting like it and being more responsible?  Was Hitler smart?  Parden the Spider Man quote but ""with great power comes great responsbility"".  Responsbility to care for species lower than us.  If you can't fully care for a pet then don't get one.  My animals are my life and I work a second job so I can afford to feed and care for them.

I know that the subject of this movie is ""just the way it is"" and there really isn't anything that can be done about it.  Humans are stupid and rely on animals too heavily for food, so this will continue happening.

I really, really want to take a large brick and drop it on the head of the person that did that to the pig and see if HE feels any pain.  If you need to kill an animal, kill it quickly.  Don't make it suffer.  If you have products that need to be tested, why not test them on the death row inmates filling our prisons?  They're dead anyway, why not have them contribute to society somehow before they go?

The images in the movie will haunt me for a long time, and I only saw the first 15 minutes!  I can't imagine what other horrors were left to be seen knowing what the rest of it was about.  I'll will go home and hug my dog and horses tight tonight and thank God that I have them in my life and that I am a responsible pet owner.

Being in the horse world, I have heard of world champion horses ending up in a slaughterhouse.  Thoroughbreds that earned their owners millions of dollars get shipped overseas for meat every year because their owners don't want to continue to care for them if they can't generate money.  How pathetic!!!

BOTTOM LINE - RESPONSBILITY FOR HUMANS AND PET OWNERS/BREEDERS TO KEEP THE ANIMAL POPULATION IN CHECK SO WE DON'T HAVE TO EUTHANIZE/SLAUGHTER MILLIONS OF ANIMALS EVERY YEAR!!!!

We thought we were mentally prepared to see this film. We were not. We both wept and had to take periodic breaks. After I saw EARTHLINGS I ordered several copies and gave them to anyone willing to watch.

Although much of the movie is difficult to watch, there are many uplifting parts, especially at the beginning and end. I consider EARTHLINGS the ultimate consciousness expanding movie.

EARTHLINGS is a masterpiece. If enlightenment begins with disillusionment, I guarantee you will be well on your way after you see EARTHLINGS!

There are 2 quotes from the movie that spoke to me, the later is taken from a Harry Beston novel.

""Every animal is the psychological center of a life that is uniquely their own.""

""We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature and living by complicated artifice, Man and civilization survey the creatures through the glass of his knowledge and sees their by a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion.

We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far beneath ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man.

 In a world older and more complex than ours they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendor and travail of the earth.""-Harry Beston 1888~1968

I had been 90% vegetarian for years, but this movie inspired me to go full vegan. The cruelty and violence we humans inflict upon animals is insane. The horrors we bring upon these innocent creatures are done in the name of pleasure and/or entertainment for us. We like the way they taste, we like wearing their skins, we like watching them do tricks, etc; they suffer and die in pain for our WANTS, not our NEEDS.

My favorite quote from the movie is: ""People might hope that the meat they buy came from an animal who died without pain, but they really don't want to know about it. Yet those who, by their purchases, require animals to be killed, do not deserve to be shielded from this or any other aspect of the production of the meat they buy."" So true. If you watch this and can still consume animal products, fine, at least you know the truth and are making a fully informed decision. If you don't want to watch this because ""it might make me not want to eat meat"" (as my mother stated), then you really need to stop and think about the absurdity of turning a blind eye to unimaginable suffering in the name of pleasure. Not survival or need, pleasure.

8197889,5,B000QX0LE6,"Hello out there, all of my Human Siblings of the world. I myself transitioned onto a Vegan diet, after I spent a year or so on an ovo/lacto pescatarian diet (this of course, was following my first 28 years of my life's journey as an omnivore on the standard American diet). In me making this life's journey, this movie was right there very capable of giving me a very valid and a very graphically unsettling reason to get my nutrients directly from the source, and cut out the middle Earthling entirely. This movie could very easily give one nightmares, but in some very wise words that I am borrowing, if you refuse to watch how you get what you eat, then what makes you worthy to continue to consume it?

  Hey, I am definitely not a butcher, but in seeing this very sad and yet very beautiful movie, I can clearly see why so very many people who take the life of one to give to another on any mass production scale consistently end up with post traumatic stress-disorder. Please, make sure that this film definitely doesn't end up in the hands of any of your Children. This movie should be treated with the care and caution of an R or even an X rated film. It truly is that graphically violent and disturbing.

  At the very same time, if your Child or your Childrenare intheir teens and they are mentally prepared enough to see such common and graphically violent occurrences, I think watching it with them would be a good idea to do. That way, they have their rock and their protector who has been right there beside them from day one while they bear witness to these heart wrenching tragedies that had this 30 plus year old man crying at several times during my first and my second viewings of this film. As I understand it, from the director commentary, I learned that these disturbing video images had the narrator just struck so very hard by it, that recording was stopped as he just had to take a walk to clear his head.

  In conclusion, if you would care to view how our past actions have just been a thing that causes torture and death for our mere convince, look no further than this wonderfully pieced together video collage narrated by the masterfully spoken words of Joaquin Phoenix. Hey, what you choose to do after seeing the pre established consequences of your actions is entirely up to you, but with this film standing in for the windows of the slaughterhouses of the world, I am certain that you will not be the same Earthling as you were before you watched this powerful film.",1474070400,8,2500,4.476923076923077
