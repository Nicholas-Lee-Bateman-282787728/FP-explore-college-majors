She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurably powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

These episodes are mostly kinda silly. The last episode on this DVD is no exception, but it ends on a serious note. Sango is lured into a trap, and Miroku must save her. After nearly losing her, he admits his feelings to her.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353369600,,1371,4.330739299610895

8127755,5,B000FZEQMS,"Excellent set of episodes in the much-loved series!  This volume shows a much needed break of humour that is welcomed within each Inuyasha episode.  Miroku finally tells Sango his true feelings, but not without that lecherous touch of his.

Great set of episodes that keeps a fan interested and hungry for more.",1162425600,,311,4.9423076923076925
8127756,4,B000FZEQMS,"Shippo takes centerstage in the first episode as he is enlisted by some fox demons looking for their lost parents. They have heard far and wide of the powerful and fearsome Shippo! Little do they know that the wimpy Shippo has been credited with most of Inuyasha's demon killing feats. Unfortunately for him, there IS a demon currently in the area. He will either have to continue the lie that has beguiled his fans or he will have to defeat the demon on his own. After that, our band of heroes investigates the rumor of a village of demon women that have been leaving a trail of skinned corpses behind them. Miroku's legendary weakness for women could result in the death of him and all his friends.

I really liked this volume because of the humor of the Shippo episode and a landmark in the relationship between Miroku and Sango. Shippo had already had a spotlight episode before this and it was a welcome detour away from the gloom and doom quest to kill Naraku. The additional fox demons just add to the comedy and cuteness. Miroku never seems to learn that his lust for women leads not only him into danger, but also his pals. In addition, it causes Sango a lot of emotional pain, because surely with all his experience with women, he knows how she feels about him. Yet he continues his behavior. Finally, in the last episode on this disk, we get some explanation of why he does what he does.",1162080000,,1398,4.482352941176471
