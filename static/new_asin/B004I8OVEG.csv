Our PBS channel here rated this movie quite highly so I bought it off Amazon when the DVD was released. Later my wife explained to me that the channel is kind of obligated to praise Australian productions whether they are good or not. More fool me.
This Australian production set in Calcutta scripted two of the most clichd, cardboard cut-out, caricatures from clich town imaginable as the Australians. The male channelled a credible Russel Crowe lite if you like that sort of thing while the woman played brittle and wooden perfectly subjugating any acting to her role as a fairly good looking clothes horse. As an Australian I am ashamed that foreign viewers might actually think we have couples like this. The scripted parts lacked credibility throughout as one predictable set piece melodrama clich followed another.
My question to any Indians reading this is: How accurately was Calcutta represented? How much of a caricature were the main Indian characters in the script?  From my never been to India perspective they were far more appealing than the Australians and one had to like the main Indian guy but I have a nagging fear I may be swallowing a fat set of patronising clichs here.
Tell me!
Two stars because it made India look so beautiful in place. None for the script or the acting.",1331683200,2,1320,4.84070796460177
4384299,4,B004I8OVEG,"I'll start with a warning: this is not a feel good movie.  But it is tough, realistic, well played and nicely shot.  Radha Mitchell's depiction of Fiona, a driven career woman is very convincing -- in India to pick up her adopted baby, but juggling work back home with cell phone, skype and her omnipresent laptop.  Joel Edgerton provides a believable foil to her character with Ben, the free-spirited musician husband, willing to immerse himself in the experience of India from the time the plane touches down (and sometimes having to pay to gastrointestinal price!).  Samrat Chakrabarti steals the show with his ingratiatingly polite Krishna, who has a talent for saying the slightly awkward yet horribly truthful comments that a western-world guide or hotel assistant would never venture (""You are a barren woman, Mrs. Simmons?"").

The story is believable enough -- Australian couple finally makes it to India after years of bureaucratic machinations to welcome their adoptive daughter.  But India is always transformative to those willing to open their eyes and their hearts, and even the hard-nosed Fiona eventually succumbs.  The signs are subtle at first -- the blind devotee who can see Fiona's mother and the whirling crowd scenes where Fiona gets seemingly swallowed by the likes of Shiva, Durga or other deities.  When Fiona makes it to the holy river and debates going to the water with Krishna, we finally see her begin to allow India to wash over her.

The ending is not anticipated.  Unlike other reviewers, who recommend caution and describe the film as disturbing with regard to the adoption process, I think it paints an accurate picture of the warmth and openness of Indian people.  They are not there to ""serve up"" a transformative spiritual experience to the Western traveler, but rather to force introspection and growth of those willing to make that journey.",1318550400,3,1881,5.055016181229774
4384300,1,B004I8OVEG,"I picked this up because of the quotes from reviews on the DVD case.  It seemed to be saying that the characters have beautiful cross-cultural experiences, but to me it seemed very shallow.  The two main characters, waiting to pick up the daughter they are adopting in India, confront troubles they are having in their relationship.  The Indian characters seem very cliched.  The main characters mostly ignore and are rude to them; also, the main characters are self-absorbed throughout the movie.  The scenes of India are interesting, but overall everything seems very shallow.  The ""spiritual"" scenes especially seem shallow.  I dislike the cliche, too, that couples who are adopting a child are really just trying to fill some hole in themselves and that they really shouldn't be adopting but be in therapy fixing things.  At least this movie avoided the other cliche of having the woman fall pregnant.  The movie itself seems to have characteristics of the self-absorbed main characters--it's like it's meant to be that the people of India are there to serve you tea or serve you a ""spiritual"" journey and even the child is just a prop to help them work through problems in their marriage.  I don't want to put in a spoiler and say what happens, but I do want to advise that people who may be condidering adoption or who have adopted a child should maybe consider steering clear of this movie. I found it disturbing in many ways.",1315353600,2,1433,4.812244897959184
4384301,3,B004I8OVEG,"Since our own trip to India, my wife and I have been very interested in stories that are set there. In this film a couple travel to India to pick up the daughter they have been in the long process of adopting. Radha Mitchell and Joel Edgerton are Fiona and Ben Simmons. India and the reason they are there tests their relationship significantly. While the differences in their natures were probably fascinating enough to bring them together when they were young, under pressure from the realities of life they now serve as potential flash-points. The adoption of a daughter is intended in part to heal the rifts. Unfortunately, as anyone familiar with India will know, it is a very complicated place. So the couple have to deal with some significant external challengers as well as their personal ones.

It is a nice enough movie. Mitchell is good as the under pressure mother-to-be, though Edgerton, while being generally likeable, mumbles his lines a bit much. It seems to be the stereotype of Australian screen men these days.  Samrat Chakrabarti is very good as their Indian `contact' and the waiflike Isabel Lucas is alluring in her minor role as a bohemian back-packer. It is a solid drama and pleasingly, it is a little unpredictable in how some story threads are dealt with. The issue at heart is a complicated one and this one becomes even more complicated than usual. It is an interesting study of a marriage under pressure. It is also a fascinating look at India. It is an incredible place and the film makers have incorporated some amazing scenes into the film. It is no classic but it is quite well done. Recommended if the themes are of interest to you.",1295568000,4,1667,4.725085910652921
8430266,5,B004I8OVEG,"This movie is really good.  The story of a couple. there differences and how I think the husband who is suppose to be the lesser of the two really is the backbone and is alot smarter and capable than the wife thinks he is but realizes after a very hard time in their life she finds out his strength and integrity.  The background is India which is very interesting, the richness of the hotel and the poverty of the city.  A real Indian wedding ends this movie which hope for the couple to get their real life back/",1526428800,,514,4.224489795918367
8430267,2,B004I8OVEG,Joel Edgerton was the only actor worth watching. Took me two days to watch. It seemed the film tried to sell the culture and could not connect emotionally.,1519257600,,155,4.571428571428571
8430268,5,B004I8OVEG,"I wasn't sure about this film at the start,well,it was more to do with the two principle characters really,I found myself losing patience with their triviality while they attempted to adopt a little Indian girl,indeed I questioned whether they were even fit to be adoptive parents,but as the story developed,I was drawn to them by the way they were frustrated a worn down by the Indian authorities evasive behaviour,which did at least cause them to realise the true depth of their feelings for each other and their need to have a child to make their lives truly meaningful. I'm not ashamed to admit I was in tears by the end of the film,its not one for the faint hearted,and its stayed in my mind since the viewing. So,from a low base initially,it IS a  worthwhile film,its portrayal of life in modern India is an interesting bonus too,and I give it five stars because its a very thought provoking story!",1509408000,,904,4.685534591194968
8430269,4,B004I8OVEG,"A lovely film, about a couple who have traveled to India to adopt a child. They have been waiting a long time to adopt their child, and upon their arrival in Mumbai, they discover they have to wait even longer due to obscure bureaucratic reasons. Mitchell's character is the family breadwinner, and her husband is the type to go off and play drums with hippie drummers--in fact, he even manages to hook up with a hippie drummer from his past. Both members of the couple--but especially Mitchell's character--experience profound realizations in this new setting, about the meaning of marriage, family, and love. I strongly recommend. Mitchell's work in this film is some of the best she has done.",1467849600,,695,4.898305084745763
