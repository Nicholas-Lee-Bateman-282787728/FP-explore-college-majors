3729601,5,B001OBMPBG,"This is a wonderful DVD to help you become aware of the
how and why of driving your RV.

I though this might help me park a little better and more
accurately, but this DVD was much more.

Really, if you're driving a 20 ton vehicle that costs as
much as a house, you should really know something about it.",1261440000,13,304,4.05
3729602,5,B001OBMPBG,"Demonstrated numerous techniques that the pros use in driving, maneuvering and stopping a motor home.",1256169600,7,101,5.8
3729603,5,B001OBMPBG,Driven motorhomes and 18 wheelers for years and learned a great deal from this video.  Highly recommend it. More than worth the price.,1421107200,4,134,4.826086956521739
3729604,5,B001OBMPBG,"I bought this just before I picked up my new motorhome. I have to say, it was really valuable, really informative and helped me really understand how to drive much more accurately than I might have without it. Mark makes it easy to see how to judge turning radius and line up lanes. After 4,000 miles of driving most of this becomes automatic but this was my first orientation and I really found it so useful.",1419638400,4,409,4.394736842105263
3729605,5,B001OBMPBG,"IT is learning RVs the easy way.  If you thought that you new everything about RVs, just watch this DVD series and relearn everything you thought you new. Great series, I have enjoyed the ones that I have and am planning to order the rest of them.  The more knowledge the better. Do things the right way first.",1400457600,2,310,4.327586206896552
3729606,3,B001OBMPBG,Very informative for someone who hasn't bought an rv yet.  However we already own one and needed tips on how to improve our braking and see some video on actually taking turns with the rv.  Most tips given on this video you can read online or watch on u tube.,1383609600,,259,4.16
3729607,3,B001OBMPBG,"Either I was a better driver than I realized or this video caters to the lowest common denominator.  Advice included information such as watch cross streets for turning traffic and RVs take much longer to stop so anticipate accordingly.  Some of the most helpful footage was the segment that they included in their free preview.  I did take one extremely helpful tip away from the video about how to line up where your edges are, but not sure that was worth the fifteen dollars that I paid.  The other factor that reduced number of stars was the very low-res recording.  I watch plenty of dvds that look fine on a hi-def TV, but this video badly needs to be remastered to not look like it was produced in 1989 (which it well might have been).",1379635200,4,742,4.466666666666667
3729608,4,B001OBMPBG,"The video points out some problems you'll likely encounter driving a large RV for the first time and how to deal with those problems.  Much of the video's information is pretty obvious, but preventing even a ""small"" problem while driving can save you a lot of money; much more money than this video costs.  So it is well worth its cost.",1369785600,8,336,4.491803278688525
3729609,4,B001OBMPBG,"Although somewhat basic, it's probably the basics that prospective RV buyers should understand before they get behind the wheel. This is a cheap investment considering the potentially disastrous consequences of making a bad turn.",1369526400,5,229,5.764705882352941
3729610,4,B001OBMPBG,"My wife and I would love to drive a motorhome, but are hesitant about driving something so big.  This disc is very helpful in showing that the average person can do it, and do it safely.

No substitute for behind-the-wheel training, of course, but I'm glad I bought it.

I disagree with the reviewer who said this is just a promotion for other products.  There are 3 or 4 *quick* mentions of other products in this hour-long disc, but it's no big deal.",1361059200,10,452,4.409638554216867
3729611,5,B001OBMPBG,Just upgraded from a travel trailer to a 35' motorhome and while I used my trailer extensively driving the motorhome is a very different experience. The tips for operating the motorhome safely and enjoying the experience are invaluable,1356393600,6,235,5.2105263157894735
3729612,1,B001OBMPBG,"Normally I am a fan of RV Education videos on YOUTUBE so i thought I brought this DVD thinking it would have more detailed information and tips for becoming a better Motorhome driver but I was very disappointed.  To me, it seemed the DVD was nothing more than a promotion DVD for RV Education Series.  Sorry I can't recommend this DVD to anyone.",1320537600,5,345,4.4603174603174605
8330261,2,B001OBMPBG,Purchased the driving series.  Only 3 of the 6 modules downloaded.  Sent email to Mark and received no response.  RV Education 101 has on 2 email addresses to send a message.  Neither appears to be monitored.  So I paid for 6 and only received 3.  What a waste.,1523577600,,261,4.333333333333333
8330262,4,B001OBMPBG,"This is a very good product. There is a YouTube video made by one of the LazyDays driving instructors that is actually better at instructing one how to drive, particularly turn and back-up, a motorized RV. However, this DVD is still well worth buying because it is more comprehensive and covers many things critical to operating (not merely driving) a motorized RV. This DVD is a good first approximation of how to drive a motorized RV. The other stuff -- e.g., what fluids to check, when to check tire pressure -- is presented as well as I've ever seen it after 7 years of scouring YouTube, web sites, books, and pamphlets, and talking to people to get this sort of information ahead of our first RV purchase. I strongly recommend this DVD, particularly at the price.",1475539200,,768,4.654411764705882

8330268,3,B001OBMPBG,"While nothing takes the place of actually getting out there and practicing with an RV in an empty (large) parking lot, this video gave me the confidence to try it in the first place.",1437523200,,182,4.382352941176471
8330269,5,B001OBMPBG,very useful and have put the lessons to use already.  A must have for all who drive a Motorhome.....  The used copy arrived in great shape and saved me bunch.,1433376000,,158,4.233333333333333
8330270,3,B001OBMPBG,"The information in this video is very basic. It may enlighten someone who has no knowledge about driving a large motorhome, but if you have any experience, don't waste your time with this one.",1426550400,,192,4.676470588235294
