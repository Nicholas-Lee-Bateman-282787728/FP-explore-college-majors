8289846,5,B001CU9986,My husband has been looking for this program on dvd for a couple years because he enjoyed it so much the first time he saw it on the History Channel.  He is very happy to have this as part of his dvd collection and looks forward to watching it several times in the future.  As usual Amazon delivers again.,1435449600,,305,4.1525423728813555
8289847,5,B001CU9986,"This is a fantastic video for anyone interested in the Israeli Defense Forces and the history of the weapons that they used/made in the past 60 years to defend their homeland! The documentary even interviews a great deal of Israeli veterans who served in the major conflicts of the country. The only downside to this video is the cost, I would say that the DVD itself is worth no more than $10.00 and because of the high price it has been ignored/which is why I am the first probably to leave a review!",1247616000,,502,4.408602150537634
