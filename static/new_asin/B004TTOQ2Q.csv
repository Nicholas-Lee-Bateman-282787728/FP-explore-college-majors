8440917,4,B004TTOQ2Q,"""Blind Alley"" is a 1939 hostage film with a twist. Hostage films were popular due to the success of ""The Petrified Forest"" (1936), and include such films as ""Heat Lightning"" (1934) with Ann Dvorak and Preston Foster. The film is based on a 1935 play by James Warwick. At the time, Psychoanalysis was all the rage in Hollywood, so the thought of combining a hostage drama (ala Petrified Forest) with psychoanalysis was compelling.

But the Hayes censors were opposed to portraying a criminal in a sympathetic manner, so it took years of haggling between Columbia and the Hayes office to come up with a script that conformed to the code but still was faithful to the play.

Chester Morris (1901-70) plays a prison escapee. Morris is best remembered for his ""Boston Blackie"" films although he was nominated for an Oscar for his work in ""Alibi"" (1929). In the 50s he transitioned to TV and continued working until his death. His last film appearance was in ""The Great White Hope"" (1970), but here in 1939 he is at the peak of his career, and he is terrific.

Ralph Bellamy (1904-91) plays a Psychologist taken hostage by Morris. He's best remembered for his role as the greedy stock manipulator from ""Trading Places"" (1983). He was nominated for an Emmy 3 times over a 30 year period, from 1953 (""United States Steel Hour"") to 1983 (""The Winds of War"") and was Oscar nominated for ""The Awful Truth"" (1937). He starred in the ""Ellery Queen"" mystery films (1940 -1) and gave us memorable performances in ""The Professionals"" (1966) and ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968). I remember him best as Franklin Roosevelt in ""Sunrise at Campobello"" (1960).

FWIW - Bellamy isn't sure who he is. He describes himself as a Psychologist, a Psychiatrist, and a Psychoanalyst, yet we first find him teaching a course in ""Experimental Psychology"" and his office has rats in cages. The truth is, in 1939 no one was really sure about mental health professionals.

Ann Dvorak (1911-79) is a gun toting moll and she does a great job. She started making films in 1916 when she was only 4 years old. She played bit parts until her acquaintance with Howard Hughes launched her career. She signed with Warners where she made dozens of films, but unhappy with the scripts, she moved to England, but unlike Bette Davis, Dvorak was not lured back.

Pock-faced Marc Lawrence (1910-2005) plays a member of the gang. He was best known for his gangster roles in films like ""This Gun for Hire"" (1942), ""Dillinger"" (1945), and ""The Asphalt Jungle"" (1950). He was victimized during the McCarthy era and his film roles shrank.

Look for Milburn Stone (1904-80) as a gang member. Stone is best known as ""Doc"" from ""Gunsmoke"" (1955-75) but he was a busy actor before that. Between 1935 and 1955 he made nearly 100 films.

Charles Vidor (1900-1959) made more than 30 films between 1929 and 1960, and was twice nominated for a DGA (""Hans Christian Anderson"" and ""Love me or Leave me""). He's best known for ""A Song to Remember"" (1945), ""Song without End"" (1960) and ""A Farewell to Arms"".

Over his 50 year career Lucien Ballard (1904-88) was voted Best Cinematographer at the Venice Film festival (""The Devil is a Woman"") in 1935, was Oscar nominated (""The Caretakers"") in 1963 and won an NSFC award for his work on ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969). He worked with Peckinpah on the TV series ""The Westerner"" and then on many other films, including ""Cable Hogue"" (1970), ""Junior Bonner"" (1972), and ""The Getaway"" (1972). He was a favorite cinematographer of director Budd Boetticher who worked on 7 Randolph Scott films.

The NY Times called it ""a rather better-than-typical Columbia melodrama"". In fact, the ""psychology"" part of the film is done pretty well, as Bellamy helps Morris unwind the cause of his frequent nightmares.

Hostage films continued to be popular after this - ""Highway West"" (1941) with Brenda Marshall and William Lundigan, ""Escape in the Desert"" (1945) with Jean Sullivan and Helmut Dantine,  ""Key Largo"" (1948) with Humphrey Bogart and Edward G Robinson, ""The Dark Past"" (1948) with William Holden and Lee J. Cobb, ""He Ran All the Way"" (1951) with John Garfield and Shelley Winters, and ""Desperate Hours"" (1955) with Humphrey Bogart.

This is definitely a film to see if you like 40s melodramas, and especially if you like hostage dramas. But it's also of interest to anyone who is interested in how psychology was portrayed in films.",1313020800,9,4393,4.841333333333333
