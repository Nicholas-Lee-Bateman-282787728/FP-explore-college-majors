1850328,5,B00008KZKI,"If only every video was this knowledgable!  Eoin is truly a master teacher in the art of keeping the student focused on the external alignment of the movement as well as the internal sensations within your body.  It is an art to talk you through many poses but still have you experience and stay in touch with your inner being.  A concept that is often missing in yoga  videos!
The location is stunning and the students embody every level of flexibility and control.  We have shared this video with many friends in our yoga community and they are all greatful for Eoin's work.
""It's all good!""  The blissology talk is inspirational and makes the planet a friendlier place.
Can't wait for his next video, I know it is gonna make us all happy!",1065571200,2,741,4.533834586466165
1850329,5,B00008KZKI,"This is by far the best Yoga video I have ever seen. The scenery is incredible, the routine is hard but not impossible for a beginner/intermediate like me. I love the instructor. I find his comments inspiring. I like his lighthearted nature.  It is rare that a yoga video can be inspiring, challenging and fun at the same time!
I would recommend this video to althetic beginners, and intermediates.

1850330,3,B00008KZKI,"This dvd is a good power yoga workout, but with alot of constant and unneccessary chatter. If you can get beyond his silly ""breathe in like sweet cherry nectar"" type comments the workout itself is solid. He never stops talking a mile a minute which makes any relaxing aspect of this practice non-existant. The setting is attractive, on a beach in Canada, and his students are in great shape. This is not a dvd for those that aren't experienced in yoga & the posture names. He moves along at a quick clip and looking at the tv would be a challenge if you didn't understand the directions. This is a dvd that I like to use once a week or so - there is a 45 minute short form that is preferred because I can't handle much more chatter than that!",1060041600,15,742,4.2695035460992905
1850331,5,B00008KZKI,"I really can't believe what a great video this is. The setting is so beautiful.  The timing of the postures is perfect.  I am relatively new to yoga, so when videos go too fast, I can't keep up.  Also, when videos go to slow, i don't get the workout that I want.
Eoin Finn seems to hold the postures, just a little longer, so you can really develop strength and some heat.  On top of this, the flow is really nice and I felt that I gained a lot of flexibility.
I liked the spontaneous nature of the dialogue. It made me feel like I was really in a class.
One last thing.  I liked that there were many different types of yogis in this video; many different shapes, ages and body types.  I even noticed one guy in the background who was a beginner like me.
You will love this video!",1055203200,,780,4.098684210526316
1850332,5,B00008KZKI,"I own a lot of yoga videos and dvds.  This is the best one I have seen yet.  The setting is so beautiful, the cueing is excellent, the routine is well rounded and flows nicely.
I loved the extra features too.  The option to do the full 1 hr and 15 min routine or the 45 minute one is great.  The technical info, the slide show, the surf/yoga documentary are all excellent.
Two thumbs up.",1054425600,12,387,4.12
1850333,5,B00008KZKI,"and i have so many I've lost count!  It is about 70 minutes long, with a nice relaxation at the end.  He is a brilliant teacher, his cueing is excellent, it is an incredible workout for intermediates up.  The scenery is fabulous, and he is a true yogi with a heart of gold, who actually responded personally to a problem when I am in another country and don't attend his classes - wish I could!
Buy it, you won't regret it.",1053043200,2,423,4.197530864197531
1850334,5,B00008KZKI,"This video is exactly what I have been looking for for so long - As a beginner/intermediate yogi, I find most of the videos out there too simple.  This video really has the feel of a real class.
I got a great workout and felt incredible afterwards.  I felt great afterwards also.  There is a lot of positive energy that comes off in this video.
The setting is so gorgeous too.  Even to someone who lives in Hawaii, the beauty of BC is unbelievable.  My only comment about this is that, because the descriptions of the poses are so easy to follow, I didn't have to look at the screen that much and I wanted to because the scenery was so unreal!
One last thing - I really liked the fact that there was people of all ages, sexes and sizes doing the video.  This just shows how accesible yoga is to so many different people if it is presented properly.
Highly Recommended.
Namaste,
Katie",1048896000,7,883,4.321212121212121

7985148,4,B00008KZKI,"I have a daily yoga practice with neighbors using a collection of varied DVDs. Eoin Finn's sessions offer varying degrees of intensity depending on one's flexibility and strength. We can't do all his postures ,and often find he's asking us to test our own limits. Listen to your body , do what you are able ,celebrate your efforts and enjoy the comraderie of your friends.",1358640000,,372,4.7384615384615385
7985149,4,B00008KZKI,I find myself liking Eoin's dvd's the more I do them. He talks a bit much but at least he uses pose names not just instruction - his backdrops are very scenic and peaceful. He is a likable hippy and tries to make yoga fun with his colorful narratives about sweet cherry ice cream being licked off your body!! Plus he's in great shape and I like when he shows off his stamina. He's inspirational.,1201651200,,395,4.28
7985150,4,B00008KZKI,"This is a wonderfully balanced and thoroughly satisfying yoga session.  Its length, its content and flow (i.e. the variety and sequencing of asanas), the tempo, clear instruction and lovely venue are all just right and work very well together.  A wide range of multi level poses and vinyasas are included, leaving you feeling that you have completed a gratifyingly thorough practice.  Beginners are catered for with clear instruction and regular information regarding modifications; intermediate and advanced yogis will enjoy getting deeper into the poses and maintaining their focus and energy for the entire length of the lesson, as well as the fact that EF includes some more challenging variations.

It's true that EF does not stop talking.  His instruction and cuing however are both really very good, and once you've watched the DVD a couple of times you'll be able to do the whole practice without looking at the screen again if you want to.  It is also true that that a lot of the more inspirational stuff is flowery and ""sweet"" (to say the least).  But think of it this way, just as with the music played on any yoga DVD, or the different accents instructors have, his style may not be your personal preference but you can chose to accept its sincerity and to use it in a positive way.  Among a million other things, yoga is about inward concentration as well as simple acceptance and non-judgment.  You may drink in every word he utters, or you can let what's being said wash over you, using the information you relate to inspire you, and simply letting the rest go.

The scenery is lovely, a pretty sandy beach.  The participants are intermediate level and very focused and intense.  The sound is consistently clear but the quality of the production is somewhat less that the shiny, polished viewing we've all come to expect from new DVDs.  The extras are OK, I found them somewhat superfluous. (There was also a fault with my DVD, causing the shorter program to jam half way through. That may be just a fault on my particular disc, or it may be something to do with the production quality.)",1193961600,3,2102,4.757575757575758
7985151,5,B00008KZKI,"I should have bought this DVD before I did.  I will never allow a 3.5 star rating to distract me again, particularly when some of the attacks against this DVD are infused with an immature invective against Finn's personality.  The pacing, perhaps the most important aspect of any yoga set, is nearly perfect, allowing one to truly work the body in a pose while meditating. It almost seems like I am swimming through this session.  Even though he places a set of backbends after his salutations and before his triangle sequence, somehow everything works.  Also, with this gem are some of the most important poses in yoga, whether one does classic hatha or power yoga.  The two single leg standing poses (Warrior III and King Dancer) are probably the two most important balancing poses in yoga.  I enjoy how he ends his Triangle and Warrior sequence with each one repectively.  Eion's seated pose sequence borrowed straight from astanga with minor modifications is also quite impressive.  Furthermore, his DVD has something every other power yoga set lacks -- a complex inverted finishing pose sequence.  When a complete yoga set is performed, it leads to a rejuvenation no other workout can match.  I only do the long version because I am doing this sequence for strength and yogic complexity and completeness.  Anyone who takes yoga seriously and truly wants to increase the body/mind connection needs this beautifully complete yogic experience.",1161907200,7,1445,5.029411764705882
7985152,5,B00008KZKI,"This is a great yoga DVD.  I also have his Power Yoga for Happiness which is also great.  I really enjoy listening to his comments throughout the class.  He is encouraging and he makes it all feel good.  This is yoga, it's supposed to feel good. I completely disagree with those that say he's too much. His comments are much more encouraging than Bryan Kest (who also has good workouts, but his monologues are unnerving).

I did the long class and although the poses were not impossible, they were definatley challenging and I was exhausted, but invigorated by the end.  Eoin has become my favorite yogi.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who likes yoga.",1110758400,14,658,4.620689655172414
7985153,5,B00008KZKI,"This is like Bryan Kest's best work (original Power Yoga series), but in a relaxed, non-exhorting tone of voice. Yes, some of the metaphors he employs are cheesy, but who cares when his voice sounds like that? I recommend his work to all of my yoga-resistant patients, and they love him too. Power Yoga for Happiness is at least as wonderful as this one. Namaste, of course!",1088467200,,374,4.597014925373134
7985154,1,B00008KZKI,"Hippy dippy, new age instructor - the only thing missing is his psychedelic, tie-dyed t-shirt from the 60's... He'd fit in all too well with the Partridge family on their bus singing the show's theme song, ""Come on, let's get happy.""  Too saccharine for me, and definitely too new age.  Which is funny coming from me because I'm a huge Leo Buscaglia fan, and he gives off plenty of ""happy"" vibes too with a genuine warmth.  And most of the yoga instructors I've seen on DVD I've been prone to like.  But Eoin is hard to take and with a personality like his, you just wish he'd at least talk less.  Unlike other yoga instructors who instruct, he rarely has anything of substance to say, just irritating goo, like icing without the cake, you dig in with your fork expecting to get cake, but all you get is an endless nightmare of sugary fluff.
If you feel you must have another power yoga dvd, and you think you might have the stomach for Eoin, better to go with his Power Yoga for Happiness which has a feature for less talk.  In his case, less would definitely be more!  But without a doubt, there are better power yoga instructors out there and it's worth your while to search them out.",1087689600,9,1187,4.392694063926941
7985155,5,B00008KZKI,"I have been practicing yoga for a little less than a year.  I own about seven other yoga tapes.  This is the best one I have seen.  The workout is challenging but I am still capable of doing it.  The secenery is great.  I like the instructor too.  On the other tapes I own, the instructors seem so monotone.  It's nice to hear someone who has a sense of humour while they are doing yoga.
I like the short version of the practice.  I have been finidingit just enough to fit in before work each day.
In all, I think it is a great dvd!",1070323200,10,532,4.0
7985156,5,B00008KZKI,"This is a great session which offers significant challenges to the beginning to intermediate yogi in a relaxed and supportive atmosphere.  Eoin apparently studied with Bryan Kest, and you can see the influences at work in the way the poses are linked so as to accumulate heat and blood flow in specific areas (especially legs) over several related poses.  In this sense the disc is like Bryan Kest 2, Tone.  This approach allows you to sink deeply into the poses and builds strength more than in the more Vinyasa-centered practices like Baron Baptiste's Hot Yoga 3 and David Swenson's sessions.  The overall arrangement of poses is also similar to Bryan Kest or Baron Baptiste, though the coaching on form and breathing is different and can give you some interesting new insights and ways to approach your practice.  Like Bryan, Eoin also gives you time to explore the positions of the sun salutation, which I like very much.  Beautiful to look at and soothing to do, this disc comes very close to that optimal balance between energy, heat, sensation and opening that makes good power yoga so good.  This is a comprehensive, challenging workout but it definitely approachable to anyone familiar with Bryan Kest's or Baron Baptiste's harder sessions.  If you like Bryan or Baron's work, try this disc for a new approach to the core power yoga practice.  As far as Eoin's commentary and coaching goes, I think his expressions are sincere and well-intentioned (if a little over the top) and his gentleness is soothing.  After all, he's a Canadian surfer, so of course he's going to sound a little goofy!  He seems like a very gentle person and I just can't get annoyed with him.  The DVD includes a full length 76 minute session and a shorter 45 minute session.  The disc also includes very useful mini-tutorials for beginners and others on how to do up dog, down dog and the whole vinyasa sequence.  Eoin also explains specifically how to modify the poses for beginners.",1065830400,14,1968,4.818452380952381
