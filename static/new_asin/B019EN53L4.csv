8744999,5,B019EN53L4,"Fabulous presentation by a world class pianist and his orchestral colleagues.  I once heard Andre Previn say that to properly appreciate Mozart's music one had to be at least 50 years old.  Well, I'm 73 now and have never heard it better.  Run, don't walk to get your copy of this dvd.",1491177600,,285,4.4423076923076925
8745000,5,B019EN53L4,"My First Impression, listening on Sennheiser HD650 Headphones powered by a 1 Watt Tube Musical Fidelity Headphone Amp and watching my little 46"" Sony TV, was of the most vibrant readings of ANY Mozart Piano Concertos I have experienced in my 75 years on Planet Earth. Let's hope this Team will do ALL of Mozart's Piano Concertos on Blu-Ray, and eventually release them on 4K / UHD when that technology matures and becomes affordable. Buchbinder and his Team play with a Precision and Passion which exceeds any other small orchestra I've heard and seen on Blu-Ray. Well done!

NOTE: There are a couple of Negative Reviews on Amazon.com indicating EXTREMELY poor Audio. Sorry, but even with my Bryston 1,000 Watt Monoblock 28BSST(Squared) Amplifiers driving a pair Quad 2905 Electrostatics (Ultra-Revealing!) I can only say that what you see is what you hear: A VW Assembly Line setting with lots of Glass and Canadian Maple Hardwood Floors - it's bright, but not objectionable! My Digital-To-Analog Converter is the Bryston BDA-2, and I'm sure the new BDA-3 will make it even smoother, once I can afford it... Better haul out, dust off, and fire up your old Tube Amps, Gentlemen, or invest in a better DAC!

NOTE #2 You will notice that this Blu-Ray is the first one Recorded in 4K, both Audio & Video, and it will probably be one of the first to be released when 4K (aka UHD, or Ultra High Definition) comes on the Market

More of this anon, once my Friends and I have had a chance to get over the initial shock of this spectacular new level of Mozart Performance! I would have to assume that Mozart is looking down from his corner of Musical Heaven and grinning from ear to ear...",1461196800,3,1681,4.672297297297297

8745002,2,B019EN53L4,"Thanks, Mr. Miner, for describing the sound, the sound, the sound. Maybe it is the influence of the movies, maybe TV, maybe it's our whole light-weight visual-addled culture, in America at least, but so many reviews (and releases!) are about the visuals, the visuals, the visuals--of a classical concert, an opera performance, a recital, a vocal performance, a chamber group, when the sound, the sound, the sound is really all (or almost all) that matters. Blu-ray DTS Master Audio, especially when the source has been mastered at the 96 Khz/24 bit level of hi-res recording, has been a revelation for me in listening to recorded music over the course of the past five or ten years, but it is a shame that so many recording engineers, and producers of music concerts, a majority of them in fact, still have not realized its acoustic potential. They are still into the lighting, the editing, the angles, the costumes, the setting, the ""look,"" alas. Thanks for warning me off another missed opportunity.",1456272000,2,1001,4.928994082840236
8745003,3,B019EN53L4,"After Buchbinder's great Beethoven concertos, I was ready for equally great Mozart. Here we have a great pianist and orchestra combining with 3
of Wolfgang's best concertos along with the same recording team----what could go wrong?  Unfortunately, someone decided that it would be cool to
record at one end of a Volkswagen factory that has floor-to-ceiling glass windows, a hard surface shiny floor and lots of metal robots sitting around.
Since the accompaniment is just a large chamber orchestra, it was imperative that it be heard. But instead we have the piano much too loud, with
the highs bouncing off all the hard surfaces (I could see no attempt to mitigate the problem with sound absorbing materials.) The result is to
minimize the grating high frequencies by decreasing the volume almost to background level, and I don't pay 40 bucks for background. Another
result is that the orchestra also gets pushed down and sounds thin. When the double bases hit the notes---nothing. To hear how it would sound in
a good hall, listen to the 2nd movement of Buchbinder's Emperor concerto: that's how strings should sound and how orchestra/piano balance
should be!  If a rating of 2 1/2 stars was available, that's what I'd use.

On a side note, all 3 concertos are scored without the clarinet, even though #27 was composed in Mozart's last year of life. He discovered the
clarinet late and then wrote the great clarinet concerto. I'll bet he would have used it in the piano concertos to great effect had it come along a
little earlier.",1454630400,3,1533,4.865900383141763
