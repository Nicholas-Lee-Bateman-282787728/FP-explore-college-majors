218118,5,6300184269,"This movie defined the use of one-liners. For the past decade now I have used lines from this movie. It is Anthony Micheal Hall that makes this film such a strong comedy. And if you want to see Bill Paxton at his earliest  and best (his Aliens lines were pretty cool too), then this film is a must.  Please, introduce this movie to your teenage children. You'll find  yourselves slow motioning the toilet scene for sure..... Will somebody  please tell me what Chet says to Wyatt from upstairs? It sounds like:  ""Yo Wyatt, you down there?""

Mitchell-Smith (Wyatt) can't even contain himself  while delivering his lines and is on the verge of hysterical laughter in  nearly every scene he is in...For over ten years, my sister and I have  delivered one-liners from this movie to each other and the resultant  giggles have been worth every dollar I have spent in keeping a fresh copy  of this wonderful movie on my shelf for all these years.

218120,5,6300184269,This is absolutely the best movie of the 1980's.  It has produced more great one liners than any other movie I have seen.  In a group of people it would be nearly impossible to not get a laugh from someone if you blurted  out one of these lines.  The other great part of this film is that Wyatt  mentions the best city in the U.S. - Cincinnati.,921024000,,344,4.074626865671642

okay... so, I guess you get the idea that I really do love the movie.  Everyone in it is good.  Bill Paxton made a great ""Horrible Big Brother"", a very early film for him.  Anthony Michael Hall was perfect... Kelly LeBrock was awesome as their ""Creation""  It was just a lotta fun.  Maybe it's more known as a ""cult classic"", but call me part of the ""cult""!!

I do have a region free player but anyone who does not, you should know it will play on a ps4 or even an xbox 360, i checked with both. I was one of the original petition signers to bring this to dvd years ago and they only released the first two season so this was a very welcome surprise this year! My only complaints are there are no closed captions which I like to use at night and also, which may be minor to some people, there is no episode listing anywhere in this set. So I have to consult imdb when I want to watch a certain episode. Other than these minor issues I must say it is basically what I have always wanted and I recommend this to anyone who likes cheesy 90's comedy. Like another review stated I experienced the same 2 discs not playing briefly and had to hit play a second time to start the disc. This only happened on my ps4 and not on my region free player.

218282,5,6300184269,"Here we have a movie that teaches us that anything is possible if we work at it hard enough and with a little luck. This was my first Kelly LeBrock movie and I can tell you that you do not have to be any certain age to appreciate her.

Lots of lessons are learned here by many people from different walks in life. Most people focus in on the scene where Lisa is confronting Gary's parents, [By the way commercial television really hacks this up and sometimes removes parts] others like the run in with Chet Donnelly (Bill Paxton). However I will always carry with me the shower scene as the one I could personally relate to (especially the shot where the camera pulled back to reveal the occupants attire).

You can compare this to movies like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986) and ""Sixteen Candles"" (1984); however those films have a more realistic chance of happening. This film is pure fantasy (or some sort of fantasy?)

See Kelly LeBrock again in ""Wrongfully Accused"" (1998) as Lauren Goodhue.",1502064000,2,998,4.627118644067797

218318,5,6300184269,"It's really no contest for me, but WEIRD SCIENCE (1985) is my favorite John Hughes movie! Is it the best? Debatable, but it is EASILY his most hilariously funny, entertaining, most fun movie start to finish. There is no let up, no slow parts, no wasted moments. Just humorous from the hilarious opening to the equally hilarious closing sequence, in which the film goes full circle.

The absurd premise of the movie is that 2 barely pubescent horny teenagers 15-year olds Gary (a brilliant Anthony-Michael Hall) and Wyatt (newcomer Ilan-Mitchell Smith), bored on a Friday night while Wyatt's parents are away for the weekend, decide to create a beautiful woman for themselves after watching The Bride of Frankenstein on TV. Using Wyatt's computer, with a little hacking, an Operation Game, a fashion magazine, and a couple of head bras thrown in for good measure (LOL), the nerd duo indeed create a woman, in the form of Lisa (superbly played by 80s babe Kelly McGillis), a tall, slender, voluptuous, savvy, sexy model. The movie also features Chet (winningly played by Bill Paxton), who is Wyatt's boorish older brother visiting while on leave from the military. The comic performances from these actors, in particular Hall (who really owns the movie), McGillis (surprisingly hilarious) and Paxton (who specializes in playing funny a-holes) are completely memorable and are just as funny today as they were 30 years ago. Smith is most obviously the least experienced of the group, but he acquits himself very well and thankfully is carried by the more seasoned trio of Hall, McGillis, and Paxton. Smith kind of breaks the 4th wall and smiles a LOT throughout the movie, but it strangely kind of works given how utterly ridiculous the premise is.

Weird Science also features several funny small roles, in particular a couple of wannabe bullies in Ian (played by the now famous Robert Downey Jr) and Max (Robert Rusler, what happened to this guy?) who terrorize Gary and Wyatt at points throughout the movie, their girlfriends Deb and Hilly (Suzanne Snyder and Judie Aronson) who both Gary and Wyatt have crushes on, an aging punk rock biker gang leader (wonderfully played by reliable 80s bad guy Vernon Wells), and Dino (played by John Hughes' stalwart John Kapelos, who also was in 'The Breakfast Club' with Hall), part of the group of blues brothers who hung out at the bar that Lisa takes the boys too, where Hall steals the show with a drunk Gary acting out singing the blues.

There are just so many funny scenes and iconic moments in this movie. Some highlights: the opening gym scene, the blues club sequence, the boys first confrontation with Chet, the meeting between Lisa and Gary's parents (my absolute favorite scene of the film), the boys' bathroom scenes at the party, the second creation sequence at the party which results in the funny montage of Wyatt's home getting wrecked (piano girl part is a hoot), the kitchen confrontation between Lisa and Chet where she puts him in his place in a very interesting way. In particular, Hall delivers a genius comic performance as Gary, replete with funny facial expressions, great physical comedy, perfect line delivery, as well as tons of charm. It's one of my all time favorite lead comic performances in ANY film! And as previously stated, McGillis performance is also on the money, managing to make Lisa simultaneously sexy, sweet, seductive, charming, lethal, controlling, and funny. She has more range in this movie than most actresses do in much more lauded films, both comic and otherwise. The scene where she squares off with Gary's stern father, as I mentioned before, makes me laugh my rear end off every time I see it. And as I said before, Smith's contribution should not go unnoticed, especially since he's featured in a lot of scenes. He has several funny moments and it really helps playing off of Hall and his antics for most of the movie.

Hughes must have had a ball making this piece. It's easily the most convoluted of his movies, arguably the only one not really grounded in any kind of plot realism or bogged down with overly serious moments. Yeah, there's the awkward, nerdy teen thing and 80s vibe, but this movie truly stands the test of time and is a true comic masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. A lot of people would probably qualify this as a silly, toilet humor, dumb comedy, but that's completely wrong, in my opinion. The humor in this movie is genuinely amenable to many people's tastes and I find a lot of the dialogue well-written. It's not a disgusting, cringy comic piece like a lot of so-called ""laugh out loud"" comedies that Hollywood churns out in today's film. Weird Science is just plain funny and does what a film comedy is supposed to do, make people laugh.",1500163200,,4762,4.832107843137255

* It is offensive by today standards. An adult woman dating under age, in a confusing mixture between a girlfriend and a sister...  As a teen back then, it was not obvious.
* The good thing is that it makes men to like more mature women, and not younger, like Anime does (which is sick).
* It also encourages nerds to be more self confident.
* It was a time when media tried to push younglings to behave like adults, and not in the maturity side.
* The bad side is that organizing a crazy party with vandalic weirdos riding bikes in the house may not be the best way to be free, but that is part of the intentionally unlikely over the top storyline.
* I did not expect a top quality transfer for such a nostalgia B movie.  Not relevant.

218589,3,6300184269,"For some reason I never watched this when I was a kid in the 80's, coming across it today I thought I really should check it out.  It was okay but overall was pretty disappointing.  Two teenage social losers fulfill every boy's dream of making their fantasy woman come to life on their computer, who is also kind of like a genie.  Spoilers - They have a shower with her but don't get up to much else.  The next thing they do is go to a bar with old guys who are avoiding their wives, how many teenage boys had that fantasy?  Then we have Anthony Michael Hall do the same over the top drunk teen he did in other movies of the time.  Then they go the mall where not much happens except their computer woman becomes the envy of the more popular guys including two guys who you'd imagine if either of our two nerds had simply stood up to them once, by punching in the face would cower away and become the bottom of the school pecking order themselves.  Then we have a party where our two main characters don't take advantage of their new coolness and just hang out in the toilet together.  I really before watching this expected a lot more and a lot better stuff to have happened to have made this movie part of popular culture.

It does have some funny lines, and occasional scenes, what Chet becomes is pretty cool and is a watchable once movie but overall its pretty disappointing.  The bullies  never get their comeuppance, our two nerdy kids learn to stand up for themselves but the next morning can't stand up to the bully brother.  There were a lot of great 80's teenage character movies that have become timeless classics, even though I thought this was one of them, it just wasn't anywhere near as good as I assumed it would be.",1474761600,,1733,4.3312693498452015

218593,3,6300184269,"A pair of hapless teenage geeks create their dream woman with the aid of a home computer and proceed to turn their social standing upside down. Not a high point for John Hughes, who directed this paper-thin fever dream of a slapstick comedy after writing the screenplay in just two days. Hughes would become known for quick penmanship later in his career - he'd write Ferris Bueller in roughly the same amount of time - but in this case that efficiency leads to an imaginative premise that never really grows to maturity. Anthony Michael Hall, in something of a leading role after breakout performances in National Lampoon's Vacation and Sixteen Candles, is responsible for a lot of what works about the finished product. His comic timing is excellent, even in the most absurd situations (of which there are many). Hall particularly soars in one drunken scene, spilling his guts and making unlikely friends with the regulars in a seedy ghetto jazz bar, but that's an early climax and the film struggles to outdo it on the home stretch. Props and gimmicks pad out the rest of the ride, along with a generous dose of fresh, Hughsian, era-defining new wave cuts. Cheap and easy, but invariably charming and authentically funny; I've burnt weeknights with worse films.",1474416000,,1264,4.883720930232558

219161,5,6300184269,"Has it been 30 years since this John Hughes comedy made it's debut? Wow, but one can't take this movie seriously anyway. It's called ""Weird Science"" for a reason. It's a goofy comedy about two male best friends that seemingly can't get a date, but yet they really like women. One day, the two decide to make their own ""fantasy dream girl"", by computer! It's a geek paradise come true! lol I have to say I was a Senior in high school back when this was released and I found it to have funny moments and some geeky ones as well. Chet, the older brother played by Bill Paxton (Titanic '97, Predator 2, Aliens) is one mean brother and finds out just what is going on when he finally meets this ""Dream Girl"". He's turned into a steaming pile of you know what, complete with his short crew cut hair, or what is left of it. He's stinking up the place and has to literally agree to never ever tease or harass his younger brother and friend again, or else.

Kelly LeBrock (Hard To Kill), plays the supermodel dream woman that comes into the lives of the two best friends. She obeys their wishes and yet teaches them on how to stand up for themselves and be better guys all around. It's a fun John Hughes movie, but don't take this too seriously.
It's a comedy and an '80s comedy at that.
Look for one of Robert Downey, Jr's early roles as the boyfriend of one of the most popular gals in the movie.
I must say that I think Universal could have done a better job on this Blu-ray edition. If they had only paid this much attention like they did with the 30th Anniversary ""Restored"" edition of ""The Breakfast Club"", it no doubt would have had fans of the movie praising it much more. 5 Stars for the move, 3 stars for the Blu-ray, because it does have some good special features included.

Special Features are ~
** It's Alive! A fun retrospective look back 4 part featurette on the making of this classic by '80s comedy standards. Sorry, but no Kelly LeBrock here and that is a shame. She was quite lovely to look at here in this one. She was amazing also in ""Hard To Kill"" with Steven Seagal from 1990.

I didn't notice any bad language.  Some brief costumes and one naked back scene.  The story was good.  It is a teen nerdy coming of age story showing that just because someone is nerdy doesn't mean they aren't worth considering.  It is pretty funny in some places and pretty serious in others.  Like risky business and the fairy godmother from Cinderella - but created by ""weird science"" all rolled into one.  Ok for teens.  These two young men are obviously nerds because they create a woman on their computer; but they act different, shy, an lacking in social acceptance, living on their day-dreams of being socially accepted by the girls at school.  They don't act nerdy; just socially inept.  By the end of their ""training"" they learn social skills and prove they are really nice young men.  The result is not the fun, the getting there is.",1438905600,,1020,4.636871508379889

219412,4,6300184269,"Weird Science (1985)

 Just to make sure the audience gets the message at the beginning of Weird Science we have our young lads watching a segment of an old Frankenstein movie.  The boys, Gary and Wyatt, promptly  embark upon their own voyage into the unknown.  They use the primitive, floppy disk equipped computer of the era to design and then manufacture their idea of the perfect woman, who in the guise of Kelly Le Brock promptly appears and asks What do you little maniacs want to do first?
 They name her Lisa after an Apple computer product.  She becomes their guide, mentor big sister and perhaps lover although that aspect of things only gets oblique hints.  Certainly her shower scene with the boys does not indicate any sexual contact.  The boys still wear their shoes and shorts.
  The makers provide us with a sharply written, very entertaining movie about boyhood fantasy and just how very difficult teen years are for most of us.  Weird Science might not make the list of top ten teen flicks but it remains watchable and fun even after 30 years.
 Writer-Director John Huges truly had a golden decade in the 1980s.  He directed (in order) 16 Candles, The Breakfast Club-both still regarded as classics, Weird Science, the incomparable Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Planes, Trains and Automobiles, She's Having a Baby and Uncle Buck.  He also wrote but did not direct National Lampoon's Vacation, Mr. Mom and Pretty in Pink among others.  By my count four solid classic films fill the spots in that list and none of them flopped.  A golden decade in deed.
 Anthony Michael Hall I thought made a better performance than his co-star Ilan Michael-Smith but Smith snagged the only award for the film.  Hall, Suzanne Snyder and Judie Aronson- the actresses who played the romantic interest of the boys, Deb and Hilly and a few others in the film went on to have careers in Hollywood, if not at the summit of stardom.  Smith translated to the academic world and spent his life as a college professor and seems quite happy about it.
 But Bill Paxon, who had a strong role as Chet the bully older brother which he did quite well-I hated him-had and still has a very successful career.  But cowardly, shallow,  mean popular boy Ian was played by Robert Downey Jr., a man now known to all for his Iron Man role.
 This solidly entertaining three saw blade movie lasts for on hour and 34 minutes, which means that we get to see it on TV often as with the adverts it nicely fills a two hour time slot.  It carries a mild PG-13 rating for some swearing and the sight of Kelly Le Brock's naked back.
 If you haven't seen it in a while, take the time to watch it again.",1435276800,,2663,4.565400843881856

219535,1,6300184269,"Wow I forgot how lame this movie was. And I love 80s movies, like Three O'Clock High, Valley Girl, Fast Times, etc.

Why did they make the two main characters so effeminate and annoying? The scene where the one kid is wearing female underwear? Bizarre. Were they trying to suggest that the two boys were gay?

And the Anthony M. Hall bit in the bar where he talks like a black dude (seemingly forever) -- did people think that was funny back then?

And just the whole premise is pretty silly -- ""making a girl"" -- the really good 80s romps are the ones that about things that could plausibly happen. This is just weird and silly.

Anyway, I'm sentimental about the 80s, so I've been reviewing some of the movies I remember.  I've seen some that I really enjoy, but this one is a stinker I wish I hadn't revisited.",1428105600,,813,4.357615894039735

219902,5,6300184269,"If you were in your teenage years throughout the 1980's, chances are John Hughes was a huge part of your movie going experience. And why not, John Hughes pumped out classic film after classic film like it was going out of style.
  Weird Science is drastically different compared to Hughes' prior films, but the underlying tone(s) are universally equal throughout all his films. Wyatt and Gary are two unpopular high school teenagers desperately seeking to fit in.
  The bottom line: this film is well worth its weight in gold. The great thing about this film is, those of us who grew up with John Hughes' films can pass them along to our children.
  This film is not meant to be taken seriously, nor literally. Simply put, this movie is pure entertainment gold. The tragic reality has always been that films are often taken way too seriously. We often forget to ask one of the most fundamental questions about the movie going experience: ""Was I entertained by this film?""",1415836800,,971,4.75

219964,5,6300184269,"Weird Science captures exactly what made 80's films so quirky and legendary.  It's not just weird scientific experimenting that results in the creation of a beautiful knockout supermodel played by Kelly LeBrock walking around all hot and impressing/exciting young teenage boys.

You also unexpectedly see animalistic motorcycle gangs driving through a house party, rockets blasting through floors, grandparents frozen in a kitchen closet, a cute teenage girl playing piano before her clothes suddenly get ripped off and blasting into an outside swimming pool, the one blonde-haired boys constant goofy facial expressions and bulgy eyes, the older brother who gets his kicks picking on his younger brother and friends in typical bully fashion, parents put in their place by a squirt gun for being too restrictive concerning their son, swapping trades between a group of older more mature guys and the young nerdy boys who created their perfect woman through computer stuff (and on a side note it's always hilarious to see the way computer technology was like in the mid 80's and realize how far we've advanced since then- and in 1985 *this* was supposed to be the wave of the future!  Yes I recall these days!  Gotta love the special effects and how cheesy they look nowadays).  Basically Weird Science is like watching a zany episode of the Simpsons 4 years before the Simpsons came out.

The movie is just really memorable writing that veers very *very* far away from ever coming into contact of being predictable which is actually what makes the movie work so well.  The whacky writing is not only a prevention to assure no staleness occurs but a movie like Weird Science is a perfect illustration of the way 80's comedies were typically like.  So much adventure, comedy, unpredictability, charming characters, a well meaning story not evident until the end, and just lots of excitement that often ventures towards violence but truthfully back then we considered it playfulness.  I won't spoil the ending, but the two teenage boys eventually realize the girl of their dreams isn't all they wanted after all.

And it's REALLY hard to believe that in one spot when the boys are sitting in bed deciding if their female creation of the night before was just an illusion or not during a night across town, you can hear Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells famous from the Exorcist soundtrack (and a mighty album in its own right).  Also quite startling that ""Tenderness"" plays, an 80's song by General Public that brings back strong memories for yours truly.  Memories of when I used to blush hearing this song as a 4-year old when it was first released since I never actually thought I'd ever grow to feel and desire tenderness one day.  Nowadays I realize how meaningful of a song ""Tenderness"" is to me.  I went from thinking it was too cute and different in the mid 80's to feeling right at home with it.  Perhaps a realization how we change over the years.  The verse melody is SO beautiful and catchy too.  This song gives me goosebumps!  Hard to believe 1985 was almost 30 YEARS ago!  Really?

And Kelly LeBrock?  She's as beautiful as any woman a frisky teenage boy would envision.  She also has the right appearance for a mid 80's film with her demeanor and her hairstyle.  She presents just the right look I think.  Watching the movie tonight I could have sworn one of the teenage female actresses was the same girl from the Mr. Belvedere series.  Maybe she is.  I'd have to look that one up.  Overall Weird Science is just a magnificent and hilarious movie.  However I wouldn't say it's quite appropriate for kids given a few bad words and actions here and there with adult topics thrown in, but it's entirely possible younger kids wouldn't notice these things.  Weird Science is highly recommended.",1413417600,,3799,4.846511627906977

220102,3,6300184269,I saw this movie due to it being being fairly well referenced and noted by movie people. It sounded like something interesting and right up my alley. After watching my assessment can best be summed up with: Its fading in and out of a fever dream while flipping though channels showing old tv shows. Its a weird assemblage of images and ideas that slink from one to the other with a loose connection of place and emotion. I don't dislike it but I don't really like it either. Its an experience but one that leaves me wondering what I just watched. Its not like I had imagined but it certainly is interesting.,1408838400,,607,4.428571428571429

220186,5,6300184269,"This is the 80s. John Hughes' film is indeed weird, at least in relation to his previous hits (Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club). Many critics feel that it was a zany over-the-top teen movie focused on special effects and Kelly Lebrock. Fair enough, but what's underneath? We believe there's a subtext to this film represented by symbolic imagery. Specifically, it's the militant/patriotic symbols that were most striking. For example: Super-Military older brother Chet. Why's he so antagonizing? Where did he go during the party? He's a plot device. He's also a symbol. He's a symbol of the U.S. military, as is the massive missile that gets conjured up through the house during the party. Notice that the missile appears moments after the bullies (Robert Downey and what's-his-face) try to make a trade for Lisa and their respective girlfriends. Such an attempt at negotiations would be common during times of war. Let's not even get started on the ""uninvited guests"" that invade the party. Seemingly a Road Warrior reference, but the leader of the bikers has a feather in his headband (Native American imagery). Very intriguing. So why did Hughes make a point to include this? Perhaps it wasn't his idea. The money men tend to influence the picture. There's a message: Be careful what you wish for?

And the Rocky theme when they show her as a gym teacher at the end.

Rented it that night and relived John Huges' vision of the 80's along with my own memories of that time, it was an hour and a half of fun and the kids liked it too.

Two unpopular high school students dream of being accepted and loved. As was an still is the case today, bullies ruin dreams. That is until Gary and Wyatt unwittingly create the ""girl of their dreams"" on Wyatt's computer who magically comes to life. ""Lisa"" is no mere girl though, more like a genie unleashed from cyber-fantasy into the real world.

Lisa is far more than a living avatar. She is a teacher as much as servant. This movie shows there is courage in all, and that bullies are really cowards only picking on those they know they can beat. It is a wonderful romp into hilarity that transcends generations with a strong lesson about self-belief. I love this movie and have watched it a number of times.

Please do not make the mistake I did and give Universal money for this insult to this great 80's movie.

I had assumed they were doing something special with it as they hadn't released it years earlier as most of the studio cash grabs did where they just released their DVD scans at the higher resolution.  I was wrong sadly as this has to be from the very old DVD scan they did.  Universal put more money into the package than they did the movie as the image is full of digital macroblocking, smearing and other issues.  I originally thought I had put in the DVD instead of the Blu-ray until I remembered it didn't come with one..

Very, very disappointing that Universal wouldn't take the time to do a new scan using current technology and treat this with the respect like a large number of other 80's movies have received.  This is sadly just blatant consumer rip-off.",1381708800,136,934,4.458823529411765

What makes this film so great is how much fun it haves, and how little it takes itself seriously. This is Hughes' goofiest film, and one of his most enjoyable to watch.

The great thing about streaming a movie is direct access to the experience without cluttering your life with stuff; streaming is clean, green and the ultimate entertainment online scene. This film offers a great chance to see early Bill Paxton acting (as big bother and big brother Chet Donnelly) as well as watch serious teenage cuties Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith play average high school geeks who up their cool quotient and get their teenage lives together when they practice a little 'Weird Science.'

The best part about the film is the comedy factor which has points throughout (SPOILER ALERT: Lisa--Kelly LeBrock turns Chet--Bill Paxton into a large pile of crap and threatens to give him a set of Elephant Balls).

220885,4,6300184269,"In ""Weird Science"", Anthony Michael Hall becomes a star.  In ""Pretty in Pink"" we saw his potential, stealing every scene he is in. In ""Weird Science"" Hall clearly outshines his whiney costar, Ilan Mitchell-Smith, who seems to fade to the background in scenes as Hall jumps off the screen.
Hall plays Gary, who is spending the weekend with his friend, Wyatt (Smith) who's parents are going away, and they are left in the care of Wyatt's militant jerk older brother, Chet, played by an obviously inspired Bill Paxton, who has some of the best lines in the movie most of which I can't quote here.  They decide to use Wyatt's computer to conjure up a woman (Kelly LeBrock) of their own. But Lisa (LeBrock) has powers of her own, and uses them in wanton ways to create havoc and chaos in their nerdy, closeted lives. Lisa uses her magic to make them cool and popular and get real girlfriends, but we find out it all has a purpose to pull the nerdy friends out of their shells, to grow a little and start to realize their potential. She helps them get back at the school bully's, Ian, played by a young Robert Downey Junior who also tantalizes us with his potential, and Max, by Robert Rusler who also showed great potential, but he went on to a quieter career.
The chemistry between John Hughes lines/directing and Halls' acting reach near perfection in this classic 80's comedy.  As other reviewers have remarked, the DVD is curiously ""nerfed"" of the edgier lines that made it so hilarious.  Hall became such a huge star, that he chose to sit out Hughes' next movie, written just for him, because he didn't want to get type cast. That next movie? The seminal 80's movie, ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"".  Matthew Broderick seems perfect in that role, but one can only wonder how high Hall could have propelled that movie in that part. <Sigh> Sadly, we will never know.
But thankfully, we have iconic scenes in ""Weird Science"" like the Bar Scene where Hall transforms in to the coolest whiteboy in the bar, creating a ""drunk Gary"" character seemingly out of whole cloth complete with a new voice.  Not to mention the climactic scene, where their overblown party is invaded by a mutant-biker gang, that is so iconic it inspired similar scenes in movies and music videos for years and virtually launched a whole career for the odd looking Michael Berryman as the mutant biker, who would appear all through the 80's in variations of this role.
Zany, silly, fun, classic Hughes/Hall magic, coupled with the music and fashion of the 80's, this movie typified the era. If you haven't seen it, you NEED to see it, if only to realize how many lines you've heard quoted from this movie and didn't realize that's where they came from. If you have seen it, watch it again!

One of those 80s teen films that was never really that good in the first place but people all pretend is a classic, Weird Science is a film designed for 12 year old boys (and I don't mean that pejoratively) who will no doubt find its wish-fulfillment-loaded plot interesting instead of rather juvenile; parts of the movie are cute and made me fondly remember the days where seeing the naked female form and impressing kids in school were numbers 1 and 2 on my priority list, but nostalgia aside the film is rather mediocre.

I can't say anything about how well this remastered version is, because I don't own it, but I have rented it and if you are reading to see how good the film is, let me tell you, it's amazing! It's a great high-school flick for boys and girls alike. The jokes are literal side splitters. My best friend and I watched it last night and laughed throughout the entire movie. Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith are excellent. Kelly Lebrock is amazing. All the characters are believable and seeing young Robert Downey Jr. is a nice surprise! He sure was a cutie.
The idea is that sex-crazed and unpopular Wyatt and Gary make a sexy woman on their computer and she comes to life and helps them become popular. In the end, they get the girls they really wanted and Lisa (computer woman) becomes the male gym teacher. There is also a TV series, but I don't know if it is any good.
If you liked Buddy's character (played by Billy Jacoby/Jayne) in ""Just One of the Guys"", ""Hocus Pocus"", and other 80's movies where unpopular boys get the girls they want, you will enjoy this movie. A younger kid probably won't understand most of it, but if you are an overprotective parent, Wyatt does wear girl's underwear, there is a brief naked woman scene (just a flash, literally only like two seconds from far away), and Lisa is often dressed in clothes that show lots of leg and her belly button, but never her breasts or bra. Lisa also kisses Wyatt, who is fifteen, and Lisa looks in her twenties. There is a lot of sex reference using 80's slang, a drinking scene where Gary gets very drunk and uses a fake ID, and a scene where Gary and Wyatt are asked if they would ""lend"" Lisa to some bullies. There is very little to no cussing.",1232409600,,1761,4.438271604938271

221009,5,6300184269,"A couple weeks ago I made a list of my top 10 John Hughes movies, and I decided to revisit a lot of his films to ensure I wasn't going on past memories to compile it. WEIRD SCIENCE, one of Hughes' earlier directorial efforts, is probably my favorite of his, because it has the sappy Hughes stuff, the teen angst, sure, but most of all, it is very, very funny. A lot of people who call this film kind of stupid and even (my favorite) unrealistic are kind of missing the point. Two guys create a woman with a computer, which results in missiles, snow, and a kitchen magically painted blue, and you're going to say it's unrealistic? First of all, Hughes supposedly started the whole teen genre with SIXTEEN CANDLES & BREAKFAST CLUB, but even at the time they were not realistic portrayals of teenage life (yep, every stereotype of a high school would share detention together, and uh huh, all nerds and awkward 16-year-old girls end up with the prom king and queen). So at least with WEIRD SCIENCE, Hughes is not denying it's all a fantasy.
 Anyway, the plot is pretty well-known: two high school outcasts, Gary (Hughes staple Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith, who apparently quit acting not long after this, and he was only 15 or 16 here), decide to make what they believe will be a two-dimensional representation of their dream woman, but through a freak lightning storm, actually create a wily, beautiful young woman they call Lisa (Kelly LeBrock). From there, the two initially use Lisa to live out what they wish they could do (go out drinking, drive, have a party, ask girls out, shower with a girl, stand up to Wyatt's military butthead of a brother Chet), often forceably through Lisa, and in the end, they learn to have confidence (and again, sure, those hot girls at school REALLY want two sensitive nerds, not the A-holes who get them into parties, sure, Johnny) and don't need Lisa anymore. Gee whiz.
 But wait, before Gary and Wyatt learn to have confidence, Gary gets drunk in an all-black bar (cough, ANIMAL HOUSE)! Gary's father loses all memory of his existence! Wyatt's grandparents are frozen in the blue kitchen because they can't calm down! A missile arrives in Wyatt's bedroom because of a second, less successful making of another woman for the jerks at school! One played by ROBERT DOWNEY JR.! The cast of THE ROAD WARRIOR shows up so Wyatt and Gary can stand up for themselves! Chet (a memorable Bill Paxton) is turned into a toad/pile of you-know-what!!! Leaping lizards!
 So in conclusion, yes, this movie is cheesy, kind of outdated (especially near the end), ridiculous, and certainly not as beneficial to the teen genre as films like SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB, but what it lacks in meaning and impact it makes up for in just pure fun. John Hughes wrote this movie in 2 days, people. I can't even plan an essay in that amount of time. So in the words of Gary Wallace, why are you messing with the fantasy? We KNOW the reality, so just enjoy some WEIRD SCIENCE, people. Cue Oingo Boingo!",1223942400,,3045,4.656133828996283
221010,4,6300184269,"In that classic 80's fashion,  only John Hughes can create such a madcap, crazy film such as 'Weird Science'.

Social outcasts Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt(IIan Mitchell-Smith) have a little too much time on their hands, with the lack of friends, hobbies, or even jobs. They spend most of their time concocting what they would do if the sun smiled on them and they could attend parties and date the girls they adore; And that's when the brilliant idea strikes!

They must create their perfect woman! With the help of a computer,  a barbie doll, and a little magic (I've yet to test this method myself...) she appears, perfect as a picture, willing to do anything they ask of her!

Lisa(Kelly LeBrock), although just created knows just what to do to help bring these boys into their popularity, and she doesn't take no for an answer!

Why this little bit of dialogue would be cut is beyond me but none the less it is so this is really not the movie in its original form.

Gary sleeps over at Wyatt's house, while his parents are away meeting their daughter's fiancee'.  He suggests to Wyatt that they make a woman as a solution to help them be more popular and to have a few dates with.

This movie was made during the ""Breakfast Club"" and ""St Elmo's Fire"" craze, When all of your ""Sixteen Candles"" were ""Pretty In Pink"".

It's basically Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink for Science geeks. A coming of age story about two nerds who can't seem to get a date so they decide to MAKE a date.

Problem one with this movie? Two nerdy guys and one girl? They have enough problems getting women as it is. You'd think they'd at least want their own woman.

But in the end, they get what they wanted all along anyway... real (if teeny bopper) love.

And Kelly LeBrock goes back to wherever it is artificially-created model-type one-hit wonder movie babes go when they're no longer needed.... I think they call it Celebrity Fit Club.

""This is too weird!"" is what a teenager told me.  I agree.  This was my view, entirely.  Weird Science had a weak, weak, plot.

Probably every teenager begining there sexual peak goes through that fantasey stage. Fantasizing abut the ultimate woman who is at your command, is older and more experienced and has nothing better to do then flirt with you in public so you can show off to all your friends. Only in this movie Gary and Wyatt don't just fantasize it, they create it.

After watching Dr Frankenstien bring his monster to life, they condjur up a wild idea to make a computer program that things like a real woman so they can ask it questions to help them meet woman. Only once they hack into the army and gain more power (its a fantasey movie, you geeks think of something better to do then argue how its not possible) they end up not creating a program, but actualy creating a flesh and blood woman with somewhat genie type of powers.

They call her Lisa and she helps them realise that all they really ever needed to do was be themselves, act natural, loosen up and have a good time. Just be yourself is the motto of the movie. And it's true. All those years of fantasizing and thinking you can never ""score"" (B&B) and fantasize about the ultimate woman falling into your lap arnt nesersery when you just be yourself and open your eyes to the real world. Also playing on the emotions of alination that some of us go through in life where you don't feel like you fit in, yet you want to.

The cloths may somewhat have out-dated themselves but i think the movie will always be accepted in anyones generation in future. 20 odd years later, i wouldnt call it timeless, but it still definitly isn't a laugh fest at what the 80's dags where like. It still holds up strong today and continues to be a fun classic comedy.

However I can live with that, but I won't give this DVD more then 4 stars because 5 stars would mean it being perfect, and for this DVD to be perfect, that would require bonus features that are bonus features.

221142,2,6300184269,"John Hughes took the teen drama/comedy to a new level.  His work was one of the things that helped define the 80s, but has unfortunately become one of the most trite, overplayed, bit of fluff in the world.  It's time to move on, people!  80s music / films, was what disco / Blacksploytation was to the 70s, and grunge / extreme violence movies were to the 90s!  But that aside, I liked this movie.

This was a pretty strange premise, a modern day Frankenstein film with teens, but it worked!  It worked because it speaks to a part of us, no matter who we are, that wants to be accepted and be able to control others.  The two nerds who want to be cool but are shunned because they are skinny and awkward, making the audience root for the underdog.  They, as only horny adolescent boys can, create the perfect woman, a slinky, exotic sex kitten who was to satisfy their every need.  It is pretty funny though, when they create this woman who is supposed to be their dream come true, but when they have her, as only horny adolescent boys can, they are so terrified of her that they wear their pants in the shower with her.

Their dream woman Lisa pulls them out of their shell enough to be somewhat accepted by the popular kids (or at least the ones who are obnoxious enough to think they are cool - that Slurpee in the mall was so mean), if not spark a curiousity.  They throw a typically huge, destructive party where they are both exstatic that they are at long last accepted but terrified of the house being ruined.  Along the way, the same popular bullies swindle them into making a perfect woman for them as well, only to have it backfire.

What prevented me from giving this any higher than 2 stars was the fact that it was just too stupid to be believed.  Sure, its the Frankenstein story again, but how everything just completely works out like magic (the house getting cleaned up, Lisa becoming their mentor, they get the girls, avoid disaster, etc.).  And that scene with the older brother, Chet, getting turned into some kind of monster made it all the more cartoony and silly.  But, huzza for the nerds!

First thing's first, the movie: John Hughes hit the mark again with this one. The script is great, and the actors all deliver it well. I love the, shall I say, ""quirky"" perfomances by most of the cast. It's definitely a movie worth watching if you're in the mood to be entertained.

Now the DVD: Well, for coming in a special box and everything, the High School Reunion Collection DVDs sure lack in bonus features. It's got all (or at least most?) of the original music, but that's about it. It's got previews for other movies, but who really wants that? So basically, it's a great movie but it's not much of a special DVD. If you're really into the extra stuff, then I guess you're out of luck. It's still worth buying in my opinion.",1122422400,3,791,4.486111111111111
221144,4,6300184269,"John Hughes and a likable, enthusiastic cast walk perfectly on a tightrope between funny and silly in this film that is still marketed as ""silly teenage fantasy-comedy"" but, to its credit, is really much more.

As a former male teenager I can tell you that lots of males spend lots of time thinking about things that:
1. No one else thinks of and,
2. Would NEVER come true

But they think about these things anyway.  To some degree the ability to measure how ""grown up"" a man has become is to discover how much he's given up these immature fantasies.  In most men they never go away entirely, although I should say that most of the men I know who are ""no fun"" are the ones who have completely left behind their silly teenaged self.

Anthony Michael Hall is featured as Gary and Ilan Mitchell-Smith plays Wyatt.  (Bill Paxton is a scream as Wyatt's military-academy mental brother Chet.) Gary and Wyatt are geeky early high-school wimps (often featured in Hughes movies, who dream of hot cars, hot babes, popularity and their own place in the spotlight.

In the fantasy world of this movie they use a computer with tons of input and connections to create ""Lisa"", played by Kelly LeBrock.  Lisa is not only willing to shower with Gary and Wyatt (in a very asexual and minimally nude scene), but is essentially a ""magic genie"", able to grant multiple wishes to Gary and Wyatt. They get hot cars, they throw killer parties, other cute teenaged girls get interested in them.  When militaristic Chet finds wild goings-on at the house (while Mom and Dad are conveniently away, of course) he initially blows a gasket.  Lisa uses her magic powers over and over.  When Grandma and Grandpa come over to visit Lisa ""freezes"" them like statues and they get stowed in a closet.  Chet finds Grandma and Grandpa in that condition and screams at Wyatt ""DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DISRESPECTFUL THAT IS?!""  Lisa turns Chet into a disgusting blubbery mass with few recognizable features except for the still-intact military crewcut on top of his head.  The Chet-mass burps and farts and is generally disgustingly hilarious for the kind of folks who think those kinds of things are hilarious.

This is not a movie for someone looking for a serious movie.  Nor is it for someone looking for ""realism"".  It's silly in a very good-hearted way.  If you ever wanted to see teenaged boys get their every wish coming true - this if the film you've been waiting for.",1121990400,15,2436,4.651869158878505

No Molly Ringwald this time, but Anthony Michael Hall is in fine form, playing one of a duo of socially-inept (but computer genius) nerds who decide to create their own woman.

The movie is quite odd, with several surreal scenes that will have you shaking your head (but in a good way). Who could imagine, while the opening credits roll, that very soon AMH will be imitating an elderly black man in a bar, talking about women who have broken his heart? Who could imagine that an MX missile will play a role in the movie's denoument? Who could imagine that a slurpee could be a deadly projectile?

Kelly LeBrock is smoking hot as Lisa, the girl created from a Barbie doll and some microchips. Robert Downey, Jr. and Bill Paxton also appear, but it's the John Hughes directing touch that really propels this film.

221177,5,6300184269,"I just recently saw this movie after hearing a lot about it. I tend to stick with the classics, which include ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Pretty in Pink,"" and ""Sixteen Candles,"" but thought it would be nice to try another John Hughes movie. I was not disappointed. You can clearly tell it's from the mid-80's, as in one scene of the movie, you see David Lee Roth doing his show DAVE TV, plus the hair and fashions are totally 80's as well.

Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell Smith) are two high school students who feel rejected from the popular crowd, not that they were ever a part of it. They desperately want to fit in and have difficulty doing so. On one weekend, Gary is spending the night at Wyatt's house and gets the idea to create the ideal woman after watching a Frankenstein movie. Wyatt is apprehensive, but it isn't long before they are typing away at their computer, designing the dimensions for their ideal woman, and feed different body parts into the computer. After some major explosions in Wyatt's room, Kelly LeBrock emerges as the ultimate woman. Essentially, in a nutshell, what she does is to show them that standing up for themselves is good, and gives them self-confidence in the process. They really needed this. In certain scenes, Wyatt is quite a looker, but he just needs self-confidence.

I found Bill Paxton's character, Chet, to be utterly hilarious in his delivery and his military-like persona. He is such a bully, but he serves his role well. Robert Downey Jr. is one of the popular punks who helps in dumping a slurpee on Gary in one scene. Love his yellow socks. He has a guy friend who likes to pick on Gary and Wyatt as well, and they have a couple of beautiful girlfriends who actually seem very approachable. They are getting tired of their boyfriends' immaturity and come close to dumping them after the slurpee incident. But in the end, at the party, Wyatt and Gary finally get these girls as a result of their newfound confidence. They actually make pretty cute couples. Love the scene when Chet hits them in the morning with the butt of his rifle.

Gary and Wyatt aren't exactly popular with the girls in school so they decided to create their ideal woman one night when Wyatt's parents leave for the weekend. The results is non-stop chaos and hilarious comedy. In two days, the boys learn to become more confident in themselves and more comfortable in their own skin thanks to Lisa. I can never tire of watching this movie no matter how many times Comedy Central or any other cable network airs this movie. I can still laugh at when Chet (played by the hilarious Bill Paxton) gets turned into a Jabba the Hutt-like creature by Lisa or when the boys take the girls home. For me ""Weird Science"" is a timeless movie.",1101686400,6,1107,4.624365482233503
221180,2,6300184269,"Simply put, this is a juvenile boy's fantasy run amok, trying to pass itself off as comedy with some insight into the teenage ""experience,"" whatever the hell that is.  I saw this years ago, and found it to be stupid & inane beyond words.  I saw it again on TV this weekend, and found that time has in no way improved it.

All of the John Hughes hallmarks are here --- teen angst galore, loads of pithy, self-aware dialogue that no real-life teenager would ever utter, broadly stereotyped adults that are nothing more than cardboard cutouts.  Additionally, of course (giving us a hint of what was to come with the ""Home Alone"" movies & ""Baby's Day Out""), there runs throughout the film crass & vulgar slapstick masquerading as humor.  It is embarrassing to thing that a movie as crude and unfunny as this even managed to be made in the first place.

I do admit that I found Bill Paxton (as Chet) to be funny throughout the movie, and Anthony Michael Hall has a certain dorky charm to him that makes him almost impossible to like.  However, it just isn't enough for me to get past the sheer stupidity of the movie.  The scary thing is, this is far from the worst of John Hughes' efforts, and that is indeed saying something.  Maybe that is why I didn't give it one star.",1100476800,2,1268,4.431034482758621

Anthony Michael Hall is 'Dr. Frankenstein' and along with his dweeb partner, create the perfect woman with a Barbi Doll and a computer that could barely play Pong without crashing. My God do you remember those 5.25 inch floppy diskettes??

221227,4,6300184269,"Well, if I were that little maniac, what I'd like to do would be unprintable here.  But seriously, what if you could program a computer to come up with the ideal woman?  Sizzling good looks, turbo-bodied, intelligent as Einstein, kissable lips, long legged, self-assured, and with a cool, smooth, velvety English accent?  Well, that's what Gary and Wyatt do and lo and behold, when the steam clears, out pops out that woman, whose first words to them are ""So what would you little maniacs like to do first?""  And what would be the effect on a couple of unpopular, unhip, nerdy guys like our two heroes, who have a nasty trick played on them while fantasizing about the girls' gymnastic team in the opening scene?  Rather like me drinking a double mocha after spending a lifetime eating sand.  I should know, I was one of the unpopular, unhip nerds at high school.
Well, they name the girl Lisa, after a girl who kicked Gary in the happy sacks after he asked her name.  And they find out she is magical, like something out of a dream.  Well face it, this is a comedy-fantasy after all.  But she has a snazzy pink convertible, the ability to give them fake IDs, and is more a morale coach for them, and an unconventional one at that, as some of her schemes involve some tweaking of the rules, such as going to a blues bar, a funny scene if you can handle Gary's high-pitched drunken jive black ramble, and of course, the party!  she tries to boost their egos into giving them self-respect and self-confidence, and most of all, trying to get accepted for the way they are, rather than what they can do, because yes, having the trappings of popularity is all very well, but if people use them only for that, what's the point?
Both Gary and Wyatt are uptight due to the strict morality imposed by their parents.  In fact Gary tells Wyatt that his middle name is Tense.  There is a funny scene involving Gary's parents and Lisa, hair all teased out like an 80's video vixen.  However, Wyatt has a brute of an older brother Chet, a Marines-type with crewcut who takes sadistic pleasure in not only verbal and physically abuse, but extorting money, as he does when he sees Wyatt wearing Lisa's undies.  In this movie, I don't think Chet's comeuppance was good enough--I'd have done a lot more.
LeBrock clearly sizzles in this movie, more so than she did in The Woman In Red, and like Jayne Mansfield in The Girl Can't Help It, she's got it.  While the interraction between Anthony Michael Hall (Gary) and Ilan Mitchell Smith (Wyatt) provide for good laughs, she's definitely the catalyst behind the two's transformation.  Despite their creating her, the fact remains that without her, they might as well be stuck in Nerd Quicksand.  In fact LeBrock's presence masks some of the weaker and contrived plot elements and resolutions.
And it's interesting to see a very young Robert Downey Jr. as Ian, one of Gary and Wyatt's tormentors.  He would later be reunited with Anthony Michael Hall in Johnny Be Good.  Also, Michael Berryman, the tall bald guy in The Hills Are Alive and the school principle in Motley Crue's ""Smoking In The Boys' Room"", makes a small but unconventional appearance.
The variation of the Frankenstein monster was never this silly or sexy, although the jejune comedy does appeal to those who were teens during the 80's.  Who knows what kind of woman I'd create if I had a computer with that kind of power, but if I did, the world had better watch out--there'll be a brand new me emerging.",1069891200,5,3500,4.605475040257649
221228,4,6300184269,"Gary (Anthony Michael Hall) and Wyatt (Ilan Mitchell-Smith) are two nerdy high school guys with fantasies of popularity and dreams of acceptance.  While the reality factor goes right out the window as the movie progresses, I think the core theme of the movie is something a lot of people could relate to, the feelings of alienation at that awkward age, where even minor differences seem so large and significant, and the wanting to fit in, to be accepted.
In a twist on the classic Frankenstein story, Gary and Wyatt start out by trying to create a virtual woman on Wyatt's super computer, but then they push the envelope and venture into the great unknown when they end up creating a flesh and blood woman.  Their hair-brained scheme succeeds beyond their wildest dreams whne the beautiful Lisa (Kelly LeBrock) appears.  Only problem is Lisa becomes more than they bargained for, giving them what they wanted, and then some.
There are so many great lines in this movie, and the casting of all the characters is right on the nose.  Could you imagine anyone else playing Chet, Wyatt's overbearing, controlling, mean spirited brother than Bill Paxton after watching this movie?
The once fantasy, now reality, begins to develop complications, as boys must contend with not only their fledgling popularity, but also how to explain the existence of Lisa.  Matters aren't helped any as Lisa decides to throw a gigantic party for the boys (Wyatt's parents are out of town).  Between their fear of Chet, a surprise visit from Wyatt's grandparents, and the arrival of a gang of mutant party crashers, the boys certainly have their hands full.  Will Gary and Wyatt get what they want?  Do they even know what they want?
While more based in fantasy than Sixteen Candles or The Breakfast Club, the John Hughes' touch is evident in his choice of non-mainstream music, direction, dialogue, and the underlying themes of teenage angst and rebellion.  There have been some reviewers commenting on how the movie may have been cropped, but I honestly didn't notice.  A big deal was made about how the original theatrical soundtrack was put back into the movie, but I had only really seen this in the theaters, so I am unaware of how previous releases were presented.  What was noticeable was the lack of any real extras, like commentaries, production notes, interviews, or other related materials.

Well, not exactly.  They are so inexperienced and scared that they don't know what to do with the wild party girl.  The movie walks us through their journey from quirky geeks to studs when they finally stand up for themselves.
The two guys have great comic chemistry with Kelly LeBrock, computer babe Lisa and create many laughable encounters with each other and other characters.  Bill Paxton, a more serious actor today, is convincing as the rotten Chet.  This is the role I will always remember him for, no matter what other movies he goes off to make about ghosts or twisters.

While you could see the divine Kelly Le Brock's character Lisa as a portrayal of the boys' collective Anima, which empowers them in areas in which they were previously inept, e.g. relating to women, she's also rather easy on the eye. This is Babeage off the scale as we know it. Endowed with Einsteinian intelligence, magical powers (L'Isa = Isis) and a bod that just won't quit, Lisa creates scenarios in which the boys can eventually overcome their fears and hangups and become the heroes that they always were.
Hughes also takes his trademark shot at the teaching profession (see also Ferris Bueller's Day Off) when one of the Mutant Bikers asks the boys not to blab about his trash-the-house conduct, as it might cost him his teaching job.

Since Hughes usually selected these songs for the sake of humor, their absence (both are substituted with yet another reprise of Oingo Boingo's nifty theme song) is annoying.

Maltin may not get this movie, but look up Roger Ebert's review on the web, he's one of this flick's few defenders.  And once you see it, perhaps you will be too.",969840000,2,946,5.006369426751593
221310,5,6300184269,"Critics be damned!  Weird Science is just plain belly laugh funny.  One of the greatest scenes in 80's cinema is the bar room scene.  There are more quotable lines in that scene alone than in the rest of the film.  Anthony  Michael Hall is GREAT, Bill Paxton is hilarious...the movie just resonates  with a fun attitude.
Critics who question the artistic merits of the  movie are missing the point.  It's FUNNY!  I only OWN my favorite movies on  DVD...Shawshank, Young Frankenstein, Amadeus, Sixth Sense, Psycho...and  Weird Science.",961286400,2,534,5.022988505747127

I think everybody can relate to this  movie in one way or another, and come on, you can't sit for more than 2  minutes without laughing! i DEFINATLy suggest this movie to ANYONE willing  ot have a good time!",954806400,,383,4.135135135135135
221313,5,6300184269,"Truly one of the great 80's flicks!  Although I loved Lisa meeting ""The Parents"" and the great blues bar scene, it's hard to single out any part of this movie as the best - I don't think there's 30 seconds  where you won't find yourself at least chuckling.  Like some other  reviewers, my sister and I have spent the last 10+ years using one liners  from the movie on each other - usually to the bewilderment of those around  us!  Along with Breakfast Club and Ferris Bueller, this is a definite  must-have for any of us who were teenagers in the 80's!",945043200,,552,4.3431372549019605
221314,5,6300184269,"This little John Hughes movie is got to the be the best movie of the 80s. Just the whole movie is incredible to watch. Anthony Micheal Hall is  perfect has one of the teenage nerds that create a woman useing  science-Weird science. Nerds Gary and Wyatt are social outcasts-that is  untill they create Lisa,a computer-genarated woman. That one weekend turns  into one of the funniest 1 hour and 40 minutes ever filmed in motion picure  history. So,if you want to see a movie with HUMOR rent or buy weird science.",941068800,2,511,4.633333333333334
