This is very important, because programs based on this harmful ideology continue to grow with a nod from the government licensing boards and government funding sources.",1476748800,,301,5.04

I watched it with a good friend to whom I had tried to explain ""the program"" It wasn't until we watched this movie that she really got it. And it was extremely helpful to her as she has a granddaughter who spent most of her childhood in various placements. This, sadly, is a part of the reality for this generation. Nic & crew have done a wonderful job of opening an important dialog.",1391040000,,444,4.235294117647059
8294639,5,B001DRF856,"Thank you for creating something that showed the horror and trauma that many kids experienced in these ""so called treatment programs""! My experience was much more violent and traumatic. However, I was one of the lucky ones who escaped and succeeded in life. There are always repercussions to such severe abuse. PTSD, nightmares, panic attacks, and so on.....

Those of us remaining are survivors. I applaud you for bring light to the ultimate hidden abuse.",1321142400,7,456,5.08
8294640,5,B001DRF856,"As a survivor of a place that used many similar tactics I'm really glad to see this exists, it gives people considering sending their ""troubled teen"" some insight into what their child might go through. I remember being unable to ask my parents for help or tell them anything because of tapped lines and consequences.

It's a disturbing movie on many levels, but an important one because it is a true story that keeps repeating itself whenever a parent gives up and decides to pay someone else to deal with their teens rather than doing it as a family.

I also recommend reading this book if you are interested in this industry and how it is hurting teens and families:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Help-at-Any-Cost/dp/B000H5ULRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Help at Any Cost</a>",1296950400,3,817,5.476190476190476
8294641,5,B001DRF856,"This portrayal of cult indoctrination, the tactics, and the confusion is spot on. Having been in a situation myself, only more strict, I appreciate the production of this film. Thank you for speaking out. May this serve as a warning to all who seek ""behavior modification"" for their children at the hands of strangers.",1295568000,4,318,4.907407407407407
8294642,5,B001DRF856,"'Over the GW' refers, of course, to the George Washington Bridge. This is an urban film very much in a New York state of mind. The less-than-glamorous workaday world of northern New Jersey and New York City is rough enough as it is. Add a addiction problem and an unlicensed treatment facility drawing Medicaid funds to practically imprison young addicts for years at a stretch, and you've got the makings of an excellent, uncompromising indie film.

Based on real-life experiences of the director (a former addict), and his sister, who later joins him in this quasi-prison, we're privy to day-to-day life of odd encounter groups, Gestapo-like staff, and a creepy, abrasive psychologist meting out 'treatment'.

According to the director, the movie is actually a toned-down version of the goings-on in this facility. After you watch this, you can imagine what true-life higher voltage reality was. They get a couple of important things right: for one, while the story draws from the director's life, it is not meant to be autobiographical, so the subject matter becomes depersonalized and more effective. Second, the cinematography is excellent, the shots seem designed to throw the viewer just a bit off, keeping things out of reach. Filmed entirely in winter, it's like a glass of cold water, inside and out.

The director pulled his cast from a pool of local talent. They're good enough to seem real, but not so polished that it detracts from the documetary style and feel. They could be your brothers, sisters or friends.

According to the commentary track, this film lead to an ongoing investigation of treatment facilities in the New York area.
