5361119,5,B009RJRHLA,"I found this by suggestion of a friend, purchasing this with no knowledge of the show other than Anthony's work on Comedy Central's Roast shows. I Was not disappointed, laughing almost non stop throughout the show. His humor forces you to think in ways you normally would but would never dare say out loud. He consistently flies over the line of wrong and makes it oh so right by the time the joke is over almost never revealing where he is going until you already landed. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humor and enjoys the style of Eddie Murphy from the 1980's. This will not disappoint you!",1361145600,5,615,4.451327433628318
5361120,5,B009RJRHLA,"It's exactly what you'd expect from Jeselnik.  Clever dark one-liners in the best way possible. Hilarious and entertaining.  He does some crowd work which is funny too, and his roast performances are in the bonus features.  All good stuff.",1360800000,2,239,5.076923076923077
5361121,5,B009RJRHLA,First saw Anthony on Jay Leno and just had to have his DVD. This is a great DVD to show your guest.,1360713600,,99,3.5454545454545454

5361123,3,B009RJRHLA,"After listening to Jeselnik's Shakespeare CD, I considered him to be one of the funniest comedians out there and one of my personal favorites, but I just felt a huge drop in quality between that material and the one in the DVD. There were only a few jokes that stood out to me as brilliant and most of the other ones were quite lame and predictable. A lot of the time I found myself thinking ""that's it, that's the punch-line?"" I'm not saying it's bad quality in any way but if you want to laugh, then pick up the CD instead. It also includes his roast performances, which is a great bonus.",1360454400,,590,4.276785714285714
5361124,5,B009RJRHLA,"Glad they have finally released an Anthony Jeselnik performance on DVD.  This Chicago performance contains mostly new material, with some classics thrown in for good measure.

As ""bonus features"" the DVD also has Anthony's performances from the three Comedy Central roasts (Charlie Sheen, Donald Trump, and Roseanne Barr).

A no-brainer purchase.",1358812800,18,346,5.745098039215686
