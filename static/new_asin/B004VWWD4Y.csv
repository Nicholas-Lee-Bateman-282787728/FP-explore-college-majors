4484894,5,B004VWWD4Y,"I have been literally riveted by this story. I followed Abby on the Internet then Amazon offered this DVD video of the entire story. What a find! Thanks Amazon and of course thanks to Abby and her team for creating this real life story. The entire world will enjoy watching this video and even though it's after the fact, praying for Abby's recovery from those dangerous waters in the South Indian Ocean. It still scares me to think about this entire trip. I believe Abby can do anything and may she have a long life. Also, Abby please don't do this again. It's just not worth it. xxxtexanpa",1329609600,2,591,4.481481481481482
4484895,5,B004VWWD4Y,"I was reluctant after ""Intrepid"" with regard to this video but would definitely recommend adding it to your collection. I would also recommend reading the book ""Wild Eyes"" before watching the film. The book provides a little more background, which is always nice. Great commentary by family and those who worked hard to try and make sailing around the world a reality for Abby Sunderland. Touching for sure. Despite not having completed her circumnavigation, it is a remarkably well told story from behind the scenes; the preparation; the interviews; the points of navigation and sail; and the untimely end in the Indian Ocean. The book and movie present the reality of blue water sailing, which is exciting but also dangerous all the while.

What is missing is Abby's own footage while under sail. Her own video footage is limited to inside the safety of her boat. In the end, it really doesn't matter given the quality and content of the film. There is plenty of footage of Wild Eyes throughout.

Great insight into an around the world trip, irrespective of age. A good edition to the small collection of quality sailing videos out there for sure.",1313798400,2,1149,4.857142857142857
4484896,5,B004VWWD4Y,"Such a touching documentary.  Its amazing to see how many people surrounded abby on her trip.  It was a true team effort and a story that will live on.  The movie is a very very good adaptation of her story, which you can also read in her book ""unsinkable""",1303430400,5,256,4.183673469387755

8444218,5,B004VWWD4Y,This biography of Abby Sunderland is mesmerizing.  The girl grabs your attention to the point you only want to read about her and don't care about her family. I love the interplay between her and her parents. She is the 2nd oldest of 7 or 8 kids. Her older brother Zac had completed an Around The World sail about a year before she sets off.  This has been her dream since she was 13 and in Jan  2010 she sets out to fulfill it (non stop around the world).  I won't give away her adventure at sea and leave it you to fall in love with this 16 yr old girl.,1480118400,,555,3.972972972972973
8444219,1,B004VWWD4Y,"Recently watched this on Netflix after coming across the Laura Dekker film, which is superior. Abby came across as a cult victim. Empty eyes and incredibly docile when around her domineering and very weird Dad. There should be an intervention for the poor girl.",1409529600,2,261,4.954545454545454

8444221,2,B004VWWD4Y,"You must watch Maiden Trip about Laura Dekker, also a 15-year old girl that succeeded and set the record to understand that this movie is just a recounting of a bad idea gone bad, and is not a well-made documentary.  Two totlally different approaches to the trip and movie making.  Abby is courageous and remarkable though.",1406592000,4,323,4.75
8444222,1,B004VWWD4Y,"The difference between Abby's adventure and Laura Dekker's adventure is that Abby had a crew of well intentioned parents pouring boatloads of failed technology and contraptions on a boat that Abby was ill prepared to sail.  Abby was never given the chance to struggle.
Laura was well prepared and learned to do it on her own.  She bough a used boat and fixed it up herself with her father's help.  Abby had a crew like no other with a new boat.  Laura knew how to read charts and navigate without a computer.  In short, Abby was never given the chance to struggle through the process.  Laura was pretty much 25 at age 14 and knew every part of her boat including how to fix it.  Laura was wired for this trip.  Abby, despite her best intentions was shoved into it.
The documentary is so filled with sap of everyone praising everybody else and how great they are to each other that it felt like a Brady Bunch movie.",1406160000,3,914,4.398809523809524
8444223,1,B004VWWD4Y,"This documentary is terrible. And not in the good ""The Room"" kind of way, either. It is basically 1.25 hours of reenacted scenes that probably weren't even interesting the first time. I have no opinion of the people the movie is about, but the documentary itself is time that would've been better spent doing something more interesting, like listening to someone talk about accounting software.",1399507200,2,394,5.076923076923077
8444224,1,B004VWWD4Y,"Waste of time, I had to skip ahead I was getting so bored with the whole thing and it still never got better.
Save your money.
The family was a bit much to take also, just some rich feel good god loving bunch.
As one of the other reviews said check out You Tube, great sailing films with real ocean sailors not this  kid and her painful parents and useless team to watch.
Once again the USA makes fools of themselves to the world.",1398729600,3,430,4.119047619047619
8444225,3,B004VWWD4Y,"I had high hopes for this documentary but was really let down. I've been obsessed with sailing and advventure stories and docs lately, been watching many solo sailing around the world docs and shows like Long Way Down and Long Way Round. This documentary is a great story young girl sails the ocean, she seems like a nice girl, comes from a nice religious family, family was supportive of her goal. I think her feat is great and loved the girl and the family but was super let down by this documentary.

There was little to no footage of her actually sailing and the little bit of footage she did take was all from within the cabin or sitting under a tent she made out of a blanket. DIdn't get to see the water, any stormy conditions, etc. You also heard very little about the actual stories while sailing. A few times she mentioned oh the boat capsized or this happened but in a very nonchalant way and didn't really give any details.

There are some fantastic documentaries on youtube about people solo sailing around the world or crossing oceans on small boats solo where they have many camera angles, show a lot of sailing, you really feel the highs and the lowes of the journey. Though this was a fairly long documentary it felt like one of those quick 5 or 10 minute docs where you feel like you really didn't get the whole story. I think it was 46 minutes into the movie, over halfway through before she actually left for her journey.

If you can watch this for free I'd say give it a watch but imho there's much better sailing docs for free on youtube, was left feeling disapointed while and after watching this.",1398124800,5,1620,4.429530201342282
8444226,4,B004VWWD4Y,"I remember when Abby's sailboat got in trouble and how riveted I was to the news waiting to hear if she would be found and rescued. At that time, I felt it was irresponsible of her parents to let her go. I was mildly surprised by the movie - I expected it to be a homemade atrocity. It was very well done, beautifully filmed, and gave Abby a chance to convince me that supporting her dream was the right move on her parents' part. It was especially good to learn that Abby was involved from the ground up in this effort - learning about all the systems on her boat by helping build and repair them. My feelings about her advanture changed dramatically as a result of this movie. She appears to be a genuine, very bright and articulate girl with a true love of sailing. I came away convinced this had been much more than a publicity stunt but rather a family that is commited to helping their children learn and stretch themselves and grow. A couple of scenes were a little long, other than that, it was well done.",1383350400,4,1013,4.30890052356021
8444227,5,B004VWWD4Y,"Abbey Sunderland is an amazing girl. Against the roaring sea she toughed out a bad situation to the very end, which came sooner than she expected. Who would have thought that a small-framed, sixteen-year-old girl would accomplish so much. Congratulations to you Abbey!

This DVD is a lesson for all parents: find your child's gift, and nurture it. You may be surprised what a young adult can do if they have a little bit of push in the right direction. I have read many other stories about youth that succeeded well beyond the ""average teenager"", and it always seems that part of the critical variables is parental encouragement. So, congrats to Mr. and Mrs. Sunderland.

This DVD is easy to watch regardless of your sailing experience. You will be entertained, encouraged, and inspired.
