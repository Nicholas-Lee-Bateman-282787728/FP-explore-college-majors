7283050,4,B00ZIT0ZOY,"Harry (Mike Doyle) is a New Orleans detective. He gets a rookie partner in Roy Cody (Danny Agha) the nephew of the mayor or something. On their first night out Cody gets too involved in a case against the advice of his more senior partner. He discovers vampires and our two detectives get immersed in a war between two vampire factions, one that feed off of criminals, another that feeds off of children.

New Orleans and vampires, what a concept, who would have thought of it.  We always like to see the decadent lifestyle of vampires. These are your mostly boring vampires who stay at home at night, dressed up in nice clothes. (Who does their laundry?) The good guys hang out at the strip club.

This is an okay film, nothing great. 3 1/2 stars. I think it would have worked better as a ""Dylan Dog"" prequel.

8720359,3,B00ZIT0ZOY,"Well, I have no idea why I have had this movie for 1.5 years and never watched it. I found it to be very good with some reservations. The vampires were interesting enough and there were some pretty good performances by some of the main characters but though the story was different and not too bad and some pretty good actors I found the performances to be somewhat strained. Mike Doyle just seemed to muddle thru his part of the primary detective and Danny Agha as the new partner was amateurish at best. Jonathan Schaech as a rival vampire to the lead group of animalistic vamps floated along as did the other members of his ""family"". Don't get me wrong I did like it but would find it hard to recommend it to others.",1492905600,,719,4.373134328358209

I watched the movie Nocturna (2015) last night and I was pleasantly surprised. Two vampire families fighting for the supremacy of New Orleans. Each having their own way of survival and both being around for centuries. The plot was easy to follow. Wow! A horror film with a plot.

The camera work was good. Most scenes were at night, but you could clearly see every detail. One detail in particular, the children being held captive in their little cages.

The film's greatest strength was it made me think the two main characters, Harry and Lydia, were real people who just happen to devour blood for survival. I like how it ended with a sacrifice and the possibility of a new love connection with Harry's partner Cody. I can easily see the sequel in this ending.

I give this movie great marks because it was different from all of the other ones in this genre. Good Show! Well written!

8720364,4,B00ZIT0ZOY,"I recently bought this movie and was surprised at how much i really liked it. Vampire movies today are either tween romances or just about the blood and gore. This is a nice drama with an interesting story and great characters. I thought it was well acted and the plot entertaining.  I'm hoping for a sequel.

My only major complaint is the vampire characters, especially Brisbane are underused. But overall I loved.",1444089600,4,416,4.763888888888889
8720365,2,B00ZIT0ZOY,"Cheaply made film. Wooden acting. No Nudity and for a vampire film, very little blood and action. The sets are cheap, stock film of N.O., and the actors are there for a paycheck.
A veteran cop takes a rookie under his wing and they find a little girl wandering around the bad part of town, the vet wants to just ignore her, but, the rookie wants to take care of her and make sure she gets home. The vet know the bad part of town is not to be messed with, but, the rookie takes the girl home anyway and walks into a den of vampires. The little girl is their new vampire and the vampires see the cop can resist their spell, so, they offer him protection in exchange for money.
The rest of the movie is a big who cares hodge-podge of cheesy effects, fake fight scenes and NO NUDITY.....the rookie even is forgotten about for about 30 minutes of the story and then, re-appears toward the end....
Points given as there is a scene of the rookie boxing with his shirt off that woke me up for a few seconds, but, that was it......",1444089600,4,1022,4.192893401015229
