8054778,4,B0007Z9QUI,"Ada Falcon was a famous Argentine Tango singer--not one of the truly greats, but one of the near greats.  At the height of a successful career, she disappears from public view.  The documentary summarizes her artistic career and sets out to discover what happened to her.  In the end she became a nun and is discovered as an old nun in a remote convent.  Interesting documentary with enough plot to stand on its own, even if you are not a tango devotee.",1365811200,,453,4.487804878048781

8054780,5,B0007Z9QUI,"""I Don't Know What Your Eyes Have Done to Me"" follows the life of once famous tango singer and actress Ada Falcn, illicit lover of composer Francisco Canaro and perhaps of the legendary Carlos Gardel. The title refers to a song inspired by Ada's seductive, green eyes. A big star in the 30s, she suddenly disappeared without a word in the 40s and was never seen again. A variety of photographs and film clips offer a taste of the glamour that characterized her days in the limelight, while surviving witnesses in current day Argentina are asked to shed some light on her motives for leaving behind her successful career. Could heartbreak or a spiritual quest for God have been the cause of her mysterious departure? The director tries to put together the pieces of the puzzle in what feels like an eerily nostalgic, contemplative and beautifully narrated detective story inhabited by spirits of the past. Some viewers may be turned off by the film's slow pace and relatively muted presentation. Others will be fascinated by its very personal approach towards Ada and its meditation on tango, human emotions and the passing of time.",1318291200,,1131,4.865284974093265
