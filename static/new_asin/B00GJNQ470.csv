6080554,5,B00GJNQ470,"For those who were young in the 70s, this is a fun and funny video (DVD). It features the young Ali McGraw (Love Story) and Richard Benjamin (Love at First Bite). Both actors were well know and gave enjoyable performances during that decade. The satire of the social behavior of the period gives us the rich princess (McGraw) at her perfect diction best - and the ever flustered, working class Benjamin, true to the part. They may not be the perfect couple, but they sure give us some laughs on the way to finding out. With Jack Klugman as the father who fails to control daughter McGraw, there is something for everyone. Having survived that age and seeing more distant makes it even better, as the viewer can relax and laugh.",1400112000,9,727,4.557251908396947
6080555,5,B00GJNQ470,Baby boomers will love this film everyone else will probably find it somewhat odd. Goodbye Columbus was Ali Macgraw's break out film that launched her career and she is utterly groovy in it. Personally I always thought Richard Benjamin was mis cast in the film but he does deliver a good performance.  Classic poor boy falls for rich girl story but done in the context of the era the film was made.  Goodbye Columbus was made at the end of the 60s and much of the storyline reflects it.  A still worthy film for your collection.,1397865600,4,528,4.479166666666667

6080557,5,B00GJNQ470,"Enjoyed this movie way back in high school! It was so wonderful to watch it on my 60"" TV, the picture was crisp and clear, the soundtrack one of my favorites by the Association. Timeless story about summer love between a girl from a wealthy family dating a guy who is middle class at best.  Funny, sweet, poignant and very nostalgic if you were a teen in the late 60's early 70's.  Fast delivery, I don't remember if it was new or like new but the quality was excellent.",1440720000,2,470,4.269662921348314

6080559,5,B00GJNQ470,"This is one of the Greatest movies and no one remembers it. A box office smash when it was released it helped an ailing Paramount Pictures start to restore it's prominence on it's climb back up to the number one studio. When Robert Evans, Paramount Head of Production saw the dailies for this film he did two things he fell in love and married Ali MacGraw and cast her in Love Story which saved the Studio.

When you watch this film you will fall in love with Ali MacGraw also, as well as Richard Benjamin, Jack Klugman and the rest of the excellent supporting cast. This film still holds up today since it deals with a relationship of two young people falling in love and the way they have to deal with the interference of their families. Ali is cute, cocky, beautiful, crazy and so sexy. Benjamin is the perfect everyman trying to figure MacGraw's Brenda out while constantly trying to do and say the right things to her wacky family so he can make the right impression. This is an excellent, excellent movie you'll be glad you spent time with it.",1428537600,4,1049,4.463541666666667

6080562,5,B00GJNQ470,There should of been a sequel to this movie I think of all the bad sequels that should have never been made and the movies that should have had a sequel this is one of them. I saw this movie a year after its original release and to this day I feel this movie is incomplete. Through the movie you always feel your missing something like when neil asked brenda if she was on the pill her answer was she took them before and they made her fat and sick which leaves the question was she a virgin?The other one was at the pool when neil got it out of brenda that she was engaged up to a week before they meet you never really find out why the engagment was broken off. Also the conflict between brenda and her mother which borders on down right hatred by the mother. And of course the sad ending which you are waiting for the next scene for a happy ending which never comes. Why A.B.C. MOVIE OF THE WEEK in the early 70's did not make the movie for television special sequel for this movie I do not know?But all in all apart from the graduate this is the next best movie to come out of the late 1960's. Also the opening the psychedelic vision of brenda swimming in the pool like a siren calling to neil to come to her makes the whole movie!,1417910400,3,1235,4.08641975308642

8623840,5,B00GJNQ470,"I saw this film while I had first entered high school way back when. This movie holds a special place in my heart. The film was told through the eyes of Neil Klugman (Richard Benjamin). I know he was enraptured by the lovely Brenda Patimkin (Ali MacGraw) but I also knew he had another eye on the success of her family. I know that I had my eye on Ali MacGraw. At that time in my life she was the epitome of poise, grace and beauty. The way I see this film it is about two lovers or would-be lovers that never seem to be on the same page. Benjamin is genuinely attracted to MacGraw but does she really like him or is he just a convenient partner for her sexual coming of age? Is she just using him? Then there is a change. By the end of the film you wonder if the message is that you make the bed that you sleep in. I read Phillip Roth's novel after I had seen the film. I thought the scene in both the film and novel where Brenda and Neil first meet was heartfelt and magical. However, the most memorable scene in the entire film is between Ali MacGraw and Jack Klugman (Mr. Patimkin, Brendas dad) at the wedding. Jack Klugman gave an excellent performance throughout this film. But in this wedding scene you can really feel a father trying to protect his daughter from the worldliness of life and if only he could really be there all the time for her to help ease her pain. This film may look dated but for me it is eternal.",1523059200,,1426,4.133093525179856
8623841,5,B00GJNQ470,"Was a sophomore in college when this movie, Love Story and The Graduate came out.  All fabulous films with ""up and coming"" actors.  Each movie was considered a bit controversial for its time.... all had excellent soundtracks.  There are days that I wish I could go back to that time.....great music, fast cars and no responsibilities....",1501113600,,337,4.982142857142857
8623842,4,B00GJNQ470,"I saw this in the movies when it was first released. I forgot how sad it made me for Richard Benjamin. Yes, there are some funny parts, and the acting is great, by everyone; the mother who is always yelling for the maid, the brother, who flashes back to his Ohio State days, and the father, who is highly successful in his business but retains his 'working class' demeanor. A movie that leaves you with unanswered questions is not only thought provoking but well done. I had many unanswered questions--but in the end I came away with a Richard Benjamin in love and a confused Brenda. Did she finally understand the meaning of family or was it an excuse?",1498176000,,653,4.495798319327731
8623843,5,B00GJNQ470,"Unquestionably Goodbye Columbus is one of my all time favorite late 60's films (next to Midnight Cowboy and They Shoot Horses Don't They?) which focuses on an ill fated romance between an unmatched couple dealing with personal differences and nonessential assimilation. Neil Klugman (Richard Benjamin) a lonely yet lethargic individual who appears to be in content living in a ""null"" existence of choice, in contrast to Brenda Patimkin (Ali MacGraw), a rich privileged spoiled self centered Radcliffe bitch who equates social standing and high expectations with money. Neil, despite his monotonous day to day rituals, lives within his means as a local librarian without showing any interest of expanding himself to a affluent social status just to be among the society's well to dos and Brenda's overbearing parents, much to her disappointment at Neil for being so unyielding at advancing himself to her ""upper crust world"". From the beginning where the two so called ""love birds"" first locked eyes at the pool resort we can see a chaotic relationship is about to establish unbeknownst to them at first. Despite living La Vida Loca together and having secret sexual trysts under her parents' roof, (which Brenda takes full advantage of Neil to fulfill her loveless desires as if he's nothing less than her personal sex slave) Brenda's overbearing and biased mother waists no time in airing her disapproval of Neil's low expectations as a suitor and an undesirable choice for her well cultivated daughter. Despite their personal
 obstacles and routinely living with her upscale parents in the suburban district of Westchester County N.Y., Brenda is securely confident
 and protected knowingly she can confide heavily on her doting yet affectionate father to provide material things such as a leather winter coat with a fur trimming collar, readily evident by Neil as a sign of spoiled dependency. The film focuses mainly on oppositions between two social classes that don't congregate as one ; the high toned affluent and the unfavorable destitute which the latter applies to Neil in the eyes of the Patimkins, as well as Brenda. In the end she finds him as an ""inambitious"" loser without a promising future in store for them and with devious intentions she goes so far as to have Neil out of her life by removing her diaphragm and leaving it inside her dresser so that her
mother would discover it, knowing afterwards her daughter has had sexual relations with him. Neil, soon ascertains the relationship is going nowhere and finds he was being used all along, walks out on Brenda, leaving her alone and saturated in her humbug tears.
The cast members are nothing but superb for their outstanding performances, especially the late great Jack Klugman who played the tender hearted meat and potatoes patriarch Ben Patimkin and Nan Martin who fittingly portrayed the imperious Mrs. Patimkin, both amply
exemplified their dramatic roles to a tee. Even their son Ron Patimkin (realistically played by Michael Meyers) an over six footer brute with
 an IQ that is similar to that of a slow witted Bullwinkle whose only occupation in his tedious life is playing his rah rah records in his bedroom and nothing else. With his protruding dark eyebrows and comical/dramatic instincts, Richard Benjamin is simple wonderful as the disoriented victim binds into a failed relationship while Ali MacGraw, with her beautiful and flawless features, can be described as pragmatic for playing the coddling clinging insignificant Jewish princess. The only disparaging issue I find in this film is the personal scrutinities from the viewer(s) who may conclude that all Jews are self absorbed with their comfortable wealth and biased attitudes toward common folks not up to their standards. Despite this irregularity, this is without a doubt one of the true great late 60's movies and because it's a classic it's also one of my personal favorites. With splendid acting in sync with detailed screenwriting and direction, (plus vintage music from the rock group The Association) this dramatic/comedy film will entertain you from the beginning to the very end. Highly recommend !!!!!!",1494806400,,4157,5.155555555555556

8623846,5,B00GJNQ470,"How shallow the reviewers of this film are to totally miss the point. Look who wrote the book!! And then look at your reviews. It is a love story of not of 2 people but of many people passing through their lives and missing the true meaning of what it is to actually love someone. She wants her way in everything she does from playing tennis to not hiding her diaphragm so that her parents find it. She screams for attention from her father who shows her love by telling her to buy a winter coat when she gets back to Boston for college and she breaks down in tears. Richard Benjamin back from Vietnam looking for something and ending up with a spoiled brat. Her mother's treatment of the maid always yelling her name and never saying please. Watch it again!!! The depth is bottomless and think about your lives and then think about the uncle who reaches out to Richard Benjamin at the wedding wondering why his life went down while his brothers went up..what did he do wrong he wonders.
Watch it again..there is nothing funny in this movie. Well there is one thing that's funny...Richard Benjamin lifting the back end of his car to try and fight off a bad case of blue balls.",1461715200,,1176,4.39908256880734
