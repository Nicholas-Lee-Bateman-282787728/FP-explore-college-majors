8435246,1,6303026818,"This video stinks to high heaven.  I don't understand how it could have been marketed.  It is poorly conceived, poorly edited and poorly produced.  It is narrated by the University of Georgia's Emory Thomas and Lesley  Gore-Burr in flat monotones while reenactors ride around on horseback and  march aimlessly.  It is so poorly edited that the producers could not even  properly match the photographs of general officers with the narration.  The  video is a total waste of money and time.  It is so bad that I tossed it in  the trash after one viewing.",956880000,5,552,4.76595744680851
