4929635,3,B0061QHUBO,"Anyone in the know, as far as pro wrestling goes, knows about Memphis... the territory that was the brainchild of Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler. Memphis was the most innovative promotion during the 70s and 80s, literally inventing such wrestling staples as ""hardcore"" wrestling, rockstar-esque tag teams and celebrity involvement in matches. Memphis was the last territory standing, lasting as long as '97 when every other regional promotion went under the McMahon/WWF machine. The roster of wrestlers who came thru Memphis reads like a who's who of wrestling. The Memphis promotion was also in the middle of the civil rights movement of the 50s-60s, as Memphis had a larger contingent of black fans than other promotions. Memphis also never insulted the fans intelligence by trying to ""work"" them into believing that wrestling was ""real""... Jarrett/Lawler booked in a way that allowed the fans to suspend disbelief while they were there, but not take things too seriously... although, as with any spectacle involving a congregation of people, sometimes things got out of hand! For these reasons (and many, many more) Memphis is really a special promotion. If a story needed to be told, this was it!!

Apparently, local Memphians Sherman Wilmott and Ron Hall agreed... after the coffeetable book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sputnik-Masked-Men-Midgets-The-Early-Days-of-Memphis-Wrestling/dp/0966857534/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sputnik, Masked Men, & Midgets: The Early Days of Memphis Wrestling</a>&nbsp;was released in '09 to critical favor, editor Hall and Memphis pop culture historian Wilmott decided to tell the story of the greatest promotion in history... Memphis Heat! They interviewed many key players from several past eras, several behind-the-scenes people and obtained many hours of classic footage (unfortunately, some not in the best quality) and put together a really truthful, coherent documentary that pulls no punches in a lot of respects... former promoter Nick Gulas was well-known as a crook and a ripoff artist... the film does not sugar coat this. Jerry Jarrett was literally the brains behind the territory and, after being on the receiving end of one of Gulas' scams, decided to start his own promotion. The catalyst, of course, was Jerry Lawler... a local boy who had risen up thru the ranks to become the most popular wrestler in Memphis. Jarrett gave Lawler a piece of the action and together they created history.

And that history includes a lot of action!! So many of the classic moments are represented here... the Tupelo concession stand brawl (Paul E most definitely studied this match in his formative years!), the empty arena match, tar & feathering the Dream Machine, Jimmy Hart crowning a new king, Ric Flair comes to town, Andy Kaufman, etc, etc, etc... so many great moments!!! There's no way Hall and Wilmott could ever fit everything in, but they get enough stuff to let the novice know what a special promotion Jarrett and Lawler had created. However, this isn't to say that the movie doesn't have problems...

Before addressing the problems, one must understand that neither Wilmott nor Hall are wrestling experts or historians... chances are the only territory they truly are familiar with is Memphis. Wilmott has been involved with a ton of Memphis-centric products, books, records, etc... none having to do with wrestling. There are so many factual errors, untruths and general faux pas in Hall's book, it's a pretty safe bet that he's not ""smart"" either. So, although there are mistakes abound in the film, consideration should at least be given to the fact that, besides their local promotion, Hall/Wilmott simply aren't familiar with wrestling as a genre and exactly WHY Memphis was different.  So, unfortunately, there are a couple instances where the filmmaker's ineptness shine through a little too brightly...

Obviously, with such a long list of past alumni, you simply couldn't fit everyone in the film... we're talking hundreds and hundreds of wrestlers. However, there are a handful of performers that have to be included... anyone familiar with the territory would, more than likely, cite: Lawler, Monroe, Jarrett, Fargo, Dundee... and the Fabs. The Fabs were the Fabulous Ones, Stan Lane and Steve Keirn. A tag-team under the tutelage of Jackie Fargo (most over guy ever, til Lawler) that was an off-the-cuff idea by Jarrett... and that got over more than any team in the territory's history. Anyone that lived in the city will tell you how over the Fabs were... it was wild!! Jarrett used the familiarity of Fargo, MTV-styled music videos (music vids are another Memphis first) and two good (and handsome) wrestlers to create something that even surpassed his expectations. Their popularity rivaled (and some say would have eclipsed had they been allowed) Lawler's. But most important is their influence... R'nR Express, Fantastics, Rockers, Headbangers, etc, etc, etc... are all teams that were directly influenced by the Fabs... they were the template of 80s tag teams... and they were left out of the film. No interview. No footage. No mention.

Another disappointment is the ending... the literal history ends with Jimmy Hart (best manager ever in the territory) leaving for WWF in '84. although understandable that this would be considered a good cutting-off point for the filmmakers, they then proceed to give the following 13 years of the promotion's existence short shrift with a couple text-only screens to end the narrative. They really sidestep the reason the promotion finally did go out of business... Jarrett left and Lawler had full control. Lawler (along with a Hollywood mover'n shaker named Larry Burton) completely ruined the promotion in less than a year. Despite the promotion maintaining it's profitability (albeit barely) throughout the onslaught of ""corporate wrestling"" that literally killed off all other promotions. Of course, Lawler might not have wanted the movie to end that way, but that's a pretty glaring omission... at least mentioned in one of those text screens.

Despite these problems, the filmmakers really do put somewhat of a proper context on Memphis wrestling as far as the kitschy aspect of the territory goes... Memphis was often goofy and corny... more so than most other territories. Monsters like Dr Frank , the Mummy and the Colossus of Death all had matches in Memphis, along with pop culture icons like a wrestling Kojak, Darth Vader and Spider Man. Lawler even once traded barbs with Batman, Adam West! It was also pretty much impossible to truly hate Jimmy Hart, as he was hilarious! The territory, while often violent, could truly be fun. Hall and Wilmott capture this perfectly.

For the novice, this movie is a must. It's a perfect introduction to a lost art form... TRUE pro wrestling. For the fan, this is also a must see... if you have 5 favorite Memphis moments, chances are 4 of them are going to show up and be talked about in this movie. If you have a favorite wrestler from Memphis, he will most likely be in this film. For the historian, you'll definitely want this... but be prepared!",1322956800,7,7160,5.2362685265911075

Growing up in Memphis, Tn. and watching pro wrestling EVERY single Saturday from around 1971 until I graduated High School and joined the Air Force in June of 1984, I was so enthralled with this show. It started off with Jackie Fargo, Jerry Jarrett, Tojo Yamamoto, Tommy Gilbert and Eddie Marlin, it was such a delight. With the split of Jarrett with Nick Gulas, Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee just took things to even higher heights. Lawler and Dundee are truly two GREAT professional wrestlers and the Memphis territory was built around them and so many others that ran with the ball when it was their time. Tommy Rich, Eddie Gilbert, Koko Ware, Beautiful Bobby Eaton, Jimmy Hart, The Dream Machine Troy Graham, The Rock N Roll Express, The Fabulous Ones and many more. As I have grown older and lived and many other areas and watched their shows and attended the house shows, I can honestly say Memphis used their talent much better than others!

4929717,4,B0061QHUBO,"During an era where there were many territories throughout the United States, one of the most influential ones was came from ""Music City USA"" in Memphis, TN and this here is the story behind what happened in front of the crowd & behind the camera here in Memphis Heat told by various personalities such as ""Superstar"" Bill Dundee, ""Handsome"" Jimmy Valant, Jerry Jarrett, ""Mouth Of The South"" Jimmy Hart, Jerry ""The King"" Lawler, Sputnik Monroe, Billy Wicks, Len Rossi, promoter Buddy Wayne, music producer Jim Blake, ""Fabulous"" Jackie Fargo, referee Jerry Calhoun, commissioner Guy Coffey, fan Herman Mitchell, Rocky Johnson, and television personality Jack Eaton.

The documentary started with how it started & evolved from the carnival circuit to the small arena with every seat having a front row view before going into the various attractions the territory would have from midgets to women & the positive effect it would have by adding variety.  Issues of racism was discussed next with Sputnik Monroe being defined as a ""black man in a white man's body"" for how he fought the fight of segregation of the black fans when it wasn't a battle he had to fight followed by the discussion of his feud with Billy Wicks & how it was such a draw that a World Heavyweight Champion of boxing got involved as well before going into the various opinions of the the promoters of Nick Gullas & Roy Welch was talked about along with how Jerry Jarrett got into promoting at a very young age.  One big part of the presentation came next in showcasing the various type of characters they had such as Jackie Fargo & his famous strut to how foreign wrestlers were heels plus the appeal of the masked superstars such as Rocky Johnson's character of Sweet Ebony Johnson before going details of how Jerry Lawler got into the business through his artwork to evolving into ""The King"" with his charisma & his feud with Bill Dundee.  Discussion of the travel was talked about next as far as the talent lived on the road to the point where they had to start entertaining themselves & the one incident that caused them to finally slow down before going into talk about the Mid-South Colosseum followed by the storyline of how Rocky Johnson came onto the scene & how he changed the industry at the time in more ways than one.  A big long look at Jerry Jarrett was talked about next as far as his mentality behind how he booked the television shows followed by the story of how he created his own promotion opposite of the other Memphis territory he previously worked for before going into the story of how Jimmy Hart went from a member of the Gentry's rock group into the wrestling business & his association with Jerry Lawler before going into Lawler's feud with Terry Funk & the empty area match along with Lawler's infamous feud with actor Andy Kaufman with the documentary closing on the story of Jimmy Hart leaving the territory for WWF.

Bonus stories include the story behind various shoot incidents involving wrestler Mario Galento, Sputnik Monroe talking about the racial issues he encountered as a supporter of African Americans, Billy Wicks on how he got a warrant for attempted murder based off a bad payoff, Jackie Fargo's emotional story of visiting a kid with cancer, Guy Coffey's experience with Muhammed Ali, Jerry Lawler on how being a radio DJ got him his first match, Jerry Jarrett's theory of how easy it is to just cast talents as themselves, how Bill Dundee's real life feud with Randy Savage started over a pair of wrestling tights, Rocky Johnson on the importance of showmanship, how Jimmy Valant made sure he would die with his wrestling boots on, and what Dick Clark said to Jimmy Hart to inspire his visual outfits that he's had throughout his entire career.  Additional footage include all the trailers & commercials for this project, a Hulk Hogan & Eddie Boulder (Brutus Beefcake) promo, a promo with Jerry Lawler & Jimmy Hart, Austin Idol interview, and The Jerry Lawler Show with Andy Kaufman.

I have nothing but positives about this presentation since the Memphis library is very scattered around & there's no real single ownership of it so to be able to see the footage & story behind that promotion is special in itself but the only thing negative I could really say was how they ended the presentation on Jimmy Hart leaving when I'm sure more could have been said in regards to the downfall of the promotion but in the end, this was a very good documentary on the Memphis promotion & it's important personalities so anyone who considers themselves a wrestling history or fan of that time period needs this in their collection.",1383004800,4,4636,4.7431761786600495

What put me off was the way some of the old talent would still talk trash like they were cutting promos. Towards the end it got too heavy on Jimmy Hart and seemed to end abruptly.

The instant video version is effectively a great way to see if you'd be interested in those, and if you so, then you'll definitely get $25 out of the DVD version because the Galento Incident alone is worth the money.

4929745,5,B0061QHUBO,"As someone who was involved in the business for a short time as a manager, and later as a script writer, i can tell you that the above review is typical of the ""smart"" fan. To nitpick over such trivial details as who was the most ""over,"" as a matter of fact to even use the word  ""over"" which non-wrestling aficionados won't even understand, with all due respect, robs the potential social importance of this incredible piece of cinematic achievement. This is the absolute best and most honest documentary of the bizarre world of pro wrestling ever made.
 It is also an important insight as to how overlooked and invalidated blue collar entertainment is in our society.
Quick now, all my fellow Democrats, who was Sputnik Monroe, and what was his contribution to the civil rights cause?  Of course you don't know, he wasn't a Northeastern opportunist from a section of town where Blacks would be stopped for even driving through. He was a rough, tough son-of-a-bitch responsible for refusing to wrestle unless the practice of segregated seating at the Mid-South Coliseum was ended. That meant that every Monday night, in Memphis,TN. one of the most racially troubled towns in the country, a professional wrestler became a true hero to Black folks. As they say in the movie, there were three pictures in every Black home in Memphis... Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Jesus, and Sputnik Monroe.
Call it redneck entertainment, a sideshow, or whatever derogatory term you wish, but please watch this flick before passing final judgement on professional wrestling.  You may just come away with an entirely different perspective. Personally, I would like to ask any of todays' politicians who claim to represent the ""working class,"" who was the better actual wrestler, Jackie Fargo, Jerry Lawler, or Rick Flair?
If they couldn't answer that, it would show how little they truly now about a form of entertainment that at one time was watched by 80% of the population of Shelby County, Tenn.,  for ninety solid, action -packed minutes, every Saturday for fifteen straight years.",1325030400,5,2066,4.959537572254336

8490924,4,B0061QHUBO,"Good history of one of this country's great old pro wrestling territories. Love pro wrestling or not, you'll learn and be entertained by ""Memphis Heat"".",1476230400,,152,5.12
8490925,5,B0061QHUBO,"One of the best wrestling docs you'll find. If you love the southern territories this is a must see. The editing is excellent, and this tells a very cohesive story. I could sit around and watch Jackie Fargo, Handsome Jimmy, Bill Dundee, and Sputnik Monroe shoot all day long.",1470700800,,275,4.63265306122449
8490926,4,B0061QHUBO,"Fine overview with great interviews and footage. My only gripe is it cuts off after Jimmy Hart leaves the promotion. I would have liked to have seen them at least cover the debut of Jeff Jarrett, for instance. It is certainly required viewing for Memphis fans and well worth a rental.",1468886400,,284,4.588235294117647

8490928,5,B0061QHUBO,"Absolutely worth whatever they are charging. Such a great retrospective that captured the fervor that was Memphis Championship wrestling in its many golden years. Getting to learn about Sputnik Monroe, Billy Wicks, and the Fabulous Jackie Fargo in addition to watching the rise of The King Jerry Lawler made this documentary worth the price of admission alone. But then to see people like Bill Dundee, Jimmy Valiant, and Jerry Jarrett get to tell some of their story as well was a cherry on top of a delicious Sunday.",1459296000,,517,4.886363636363637
8490929,4,B0061QHUBO,Loved this DVD but WAY too long! They are actually going to be showing this movie again right here in Memphis with a few stars from the documentary showing up for the audience! Jerry Jarrett will personally be in attendance! It's been a while since I last watched this so I'm looking forward to this and I'm looking forward to 4 hours of fun!,1458604800,,342,4.359375
