It begins with a warmup and great stretch (one of the Firm's best). Then it goes into about 30 min of what the Firm calls ""ballroom aerobics."" Don't be put off by that title, because I'm about as choreography-challenged as possible, but I was able to master many of the moves by the second time I did the tape. Some of the aerobics are on the floor using hand weights, and some are using a short (I use a 4"") step. There are also two tall box (12-14"") sections. Then there is a tricep muscle building with weights small section and the rest of the action is on the floor. This video has some of the best lower body work from the Firm including table work, adductor and abductor work, and bridge work. This floor work really gets your lower body in fantastic shape. I cannot recommend this video enough if you are looking for something fun and different that really helps to get you into great shape.",1082937600,8,1035,4.312820512820513
