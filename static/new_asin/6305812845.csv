7895202,5,6305812845,"This collection features the first three episodes of season 2.  Things start off much as they did in season 1 with ""Little Arcadia.""  Meryl and Millie get involved in a land dispute.  Not a bad episode by any means, but the spirit is that of ""Quick Draw"" - a romp where you know the good guys will prevail.  Still, ""Little Arcadia"" is noteworthy for its central conceit - Vash appears only as a supporting player, and Wolfwood appears not at all.  The girls save the day.
""Demon's Eye"" is a goods indicator of what is to come. Legato Bluesummers sets the first of the Gung-Ho Guns on Vash.  Though not the weirdest of the GHG, Dominique is intriguing because of gher powers.  A good season two episode.
""Fifth Moon"" is one of the pivotal moments in the series.  Two more Gung-Ho Guns hunt Vash, who finds out just how ruthless Legato is.  The conflict sets off a reaction in Vash, who reveals just how much more than human he is when he blows a crater in the moon.  This episode offers insight into the destruction of July twenty-three years before, as well as further establishing Nicholas Wolfwood's character.
All in all, classic episodes of an anime classic.",1056844800,,1162,4.570048309178744
