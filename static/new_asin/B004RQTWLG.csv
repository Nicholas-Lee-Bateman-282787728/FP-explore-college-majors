8439190,5,B004RQTWLG,"Lama Marut has given us a very detailed, practical approach to the art of happiness via the path of devotion.  His commitment to and experience with making this complex subject seem simple and doable is unparalleled in his genre.  His style is humorous, witty, passionate, and down-to-earth, as he includes personal details and stories from his experiences with his own teachers.  I highly recommend this to any and all who are inclined to this love-centered approach to the spriitual journey.",1310342400,4,493,5.1375
8439191,5,B004RQTWLG,"Lama Marut has such an uncanny and easy way of making extremely complex ancient wisdom seem accessible.  He's a westerner by birth who grew up in the same crucible many of us did, and this informs the way he presents his considerable scholarship of world faiths.  If you've ever had the privilege to hear him speak at one of his many packed events around the world, you already know how funny and powerful an experience that can be.  But with his recent move into a more retreat based lifestyle, the opportunities for seeing him in person have become quite rare.  Which is why this video is such a treasure.

This is a distillation of a much longer teaching on the subject of finding happiness through the discipline of following your perfect vision of a teacher.  This is deep stuff, but Lama Marut handles it like Miles Davis handles a trumpet, or Santana handles a guitar.  He makes it look easy and we feel moved to amazing places by his adroitness.

The content is extremely accessible but at the same time will bear MANY repeated viewings.  You can watch it start to finish, or jump directly to a particular chapter dealing with a specific issue you want to focus on.  A great learning and teaching tool, or just a source of refuge.

I cannot recommend this video highly enough for anyone interested in Buddhism, spiritual development, or just becoming happier.",1300752000,3,1367,4.677824267782427
