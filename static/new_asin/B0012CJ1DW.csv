8245028,2,B0012CJ1DW,"Commentators here have it wrong. Although this is an interesting DVD, it is NOT the 'Visions of Israel' PBS broadcast. 'Israel Aerial Odyssey' has 2 parts. The first part is a short 23 minute compilation of clips with a choice of English or Hebrew narration. The editing is incoherent, illogical, and too fast, the narration is also irrelevant and adds nothing to a tiring compilation of much too many clips. This is more like the stuff that was left on the cutting room floor. The second part is a 50 minute film entitled 'Skyway: Israel North to South'. This is the film that became 'Visions of Israel' and is very good. Unfortunately, there is no narration.
Save your money and wait for the PBS Vision series version which is expected to be released in the summer of 2010.",1268438400,,775,4.6231884057971016

There is some narration to guide you but the pictures are allowed to speak for themselves.  If you've been to Israel, it will bring back wonderful memories.  If you haven't been to Israel, it will entice you to go!",1246233600,3,370,4.5606060606060606
8245030,5,B0012CJ1DW,"I happened to catch the Visions of Israel video on the local PBS channel but missed most of it and haven't been able to find it again since...that was an utterly beautiful look beyond the basic tourist traps and typical location stops in Israel to the beauty and history of the more remote areas. The other terrific aspect was it was filmed from the air. When this came up I jumped at the opportunity to view it since the aerial views really add an entirely new dimension to the landscape and understanding of Israel. While relatively short, the extras are well worth watching (something I rarely ever do) and the total effect is a terrific. Highly enjoyable - my favorite Israel travel video to date!",1241136000,4,701,4.616
