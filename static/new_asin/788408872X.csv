7900178,5,788408872X,"Young Xiaoyan is a bright girl devoted to her studies and is determined to study her way out of poverty. As her school increases the fees beyond the family budget, her mother would prefer to pay school fees for her good-for-nothing brothers rather than for her. Undaunted and refusing to be considered inferior on account of her gender, she shows exceptional fortitude and robust common sense in attempting to earn her school fees herself. In these times, when most students take going to school for granted, viewing this film is a truly humbling experience. Young women like Xiaoyan are a credit to all womankind.",1376265600,,614,4.913461538461538
