3148371,5,B0015XM2ZM,"I'm Still Here: Real Diaries of Young People Who Lived During the Holocaust is such a wonderful video for people of all ages to watch, but especially teens. I first watched it when it was aired on MTV in 2008. Immediately, I was haunted. I have never felt so connected to people before in my life. Moby did the music for the special documentary and he captured anguish, pain, and small amounts of freedom perfectly. The whole package is a small, short glimpse into the minds of real suffering humans... and it is well suited for people who cherish the history of the Jewish Holocaust, like myself, and for people who know nothing of it.",1313193600,8,636,4.539130434782609
3148372,5,B0015XM2ZM,"I found this film in a Holocaust resource trunk I was lucky enough to borrow from the Washington State Holocaust and Resource Center a few years ago. I played this film for my 9th graders during our Night and Holocaust unit, and I found the film to be one of the best resources to use during our unit. Many students told me they could relate to some of the real-life teenagers in the documentary. While assessing their understanding of the concepts and information they learned during the unit, I found many students used this film to help explain their answers and ideas about the Holocaust. I will definitely use this film again!",1306713600,11,631,4.642857142857143
3148373,5,B0015XM2ZM,"First off...this is a movie about the HOLOCAUST, not some terrible actor--I think many people are confused...

I use this with my High School Students.  It is Fantastic!

I highly recommend it.",1304985600,6,193,4.96875
3148374,3,B0015XM2ZM,"Please be aware that this item is about young people during the Holocaust.  Ten of the 12 reviews to date are about another DVD by the same title.  Amazon, please fix this!!",1304121600,6,173,4.375
3148375,5,B0015XM2ZM,"This film is about the children of the Holocaust and their diaries.  These children have wisdom and want to share with the world their fears, emotions and horror they are experiencing.  Would certainly recommend to purchase.",1272326400,5,224,5.194444444444445
3148376,5,B0015XM2ZM,"Watching this chain of tragic stories, I felt a profound sense of soul-tugging sadness, the kind where it rains in your heart . . .Yet the experience is simultaneously uplifting because we feel their strength despite their pain, sadness and gnawing hunger, and we want to fight against the horrors of the contemporary world. Viewing this film is a truly enobling experience.",1249084800,7,374,5.048387096774194

8260281,5,B0015XM2ZM,"My 8th grade Chicago students were deeply moved by these diaries, as we explored the Holocaust.  The selections, still photos, respectful reenactments, narrative, and even the background music by Moby created an experience you could not turn away from.  My students referred to the stories and images later in their discussions and writings.  This DVD is a MUST in your Holocaust unit, or to extend your experience with other war diaries.",1454112000,,438,5.140845070422535
8260282,5,B0015XM2ZM,"My students care about very few videos I show in class, but this one is good.  They actually came up after class to compliment me on it and tell me how much they like it.  Great educational video about the Holocaust and incredibly moving.  Great for teenagers to think about what other teenagers went through at that time.",1426550400,,322,4.517241379310345

8260284,5,B0015XM2ZM,I used this DVD during a unit I was teaching on the Holocaust in my English class. The students were riveted and moved by the accounts of young people their age and the horrors they endured. A complete must-have if you are a history or English teacher.,1390608000,3,252,4.382978723404255
8260285,5,B0015XM2ZM,I've used this in class with 9 and 10th graders. They can connect with the diaries as peers. This helps to put a face to someone from two or three generations before they were  born.,1387324800,2,182,4.2
8260286,5,B0015XM2ZM,"This movie, created from Alexandra Zapruder's book Salvaged Pages is wonderful. Of course it's very sad, but very well done. My 8th grade students got a lot out of it.",1368403200,,167,4.6
8260287,5,B0015XM2ZM,MTV has done an excellent job!  This is an excellent resource for English or Social Studies classes. It will make a great addition to our study of the Diary of Anne Frank.,1363737600,4,171,4.34375
8260288,5,B0015XM2ZM,I plan on using this with my US History class to supplement readings in Salvaged Pages. Bringing to life the children in the book.  It is a great primary source on the Holocaust.,1357084800,2,178,4.393939393939394
8260289,1,B0015XM2ZM,"This is just a little caveat to all you teachers out there.  I was planning on showing I'm Still Here this afternoon as a means to introduce the collection of Holocaust diaries: Salvaged Pages.  I never thought to make sure the DVD actually works--who does?  It turns our my copy of the DVD is completely defective.  It won't work on any classroom computer nor any of our DVD players.

Must dash--now I need to plan something else!",1316649600,,431,4.545454545454546
