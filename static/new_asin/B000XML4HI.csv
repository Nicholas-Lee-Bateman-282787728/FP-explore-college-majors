8228783,5,B000XML4HI,I bought this for a tapdance class I am taking.  It is fun to watch Bob Scheerer dance but I could not tell what the heck he was doing with his feet.  Steve Zee slows it down but still taps pretty fast.  I ended up hitting repeat a zillion times to figure out what was going on.  Someday I'll figure it out.,1270857600,,307,3.903225806451613
