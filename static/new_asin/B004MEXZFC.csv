8714394,1,B004MEXZFC,"I was very disappointed with this DVD! I love the work of the late Wilson Hurley but this video was nothing more than dialog between him and the interviewer. I knew that this wasn't a painting demonstration DVD, but I did expect that there would be some information about his painting process/technique and would perhaps show images of sequential steps of the painting that was on the cover. There was nothing of value on this DVD for an artist or an art lover. The audio quality was also very poor.",1440720000,,499,4.555555555555555
