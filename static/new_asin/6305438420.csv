1025833,2,6305438420,"The Keys of Marinus is a good example of what can go wrong with a new series.  Doctor Who was in its infancy, it's first year to be exact.  The Keys of Marinus dealt with a series of stories within the story.  The Doctor and his companions arrive on Marinus and find they can only leave if they help the keeper of a powerful artifact recover a number of keys that can activate it.  The problem is the keys are scattered throughout the planet.  The four are given travel watches that transport them to each of the keys locations and thus adventure ensues.  The problem is the adventures are boring for the most part.  Keys of Marinus us only for the diehard fan.",976060800,,661,4.32520325203252
1025834,3,6305438420,"""The Keys of Marinus"", the first Dr Who story written by Terry Nation after ""The Daleks"", is pure B-grade adventure/quest style entertainment. It is not taxing on the brain and has a certain trashy but endearing quality. I first read the novelisation of this adventure and loved it! I remember suspense, action and constantly wondering where the travellers would end up next. Years later I finally see the story. It is still enjoyable, but the televised version certainly loses something. It's the type of story that is better realised as a novel, for the shoestring budget of the programme, especially in the '60s, simply cannot deliver. But, all this aside, it is entertaining. Dividing the story into different locations makes the story less padded, especially for a six parter, but sometimes the individual stories go on for too long. However, the atmosphere generated by the novel is fairly well maintained in certain episodes. ""The Velvet Web"", which could have been a treatise on consumerism if the rest of the story was more of an intellectually stimulating one, retains the sense of paranoia felt by Barbara when she sees everything differently. ""The Screaming Jungle"" has a similar feel - a creeping terror of the unknown. I always remember ""The Snows of Terror"" as being wonderful - the televised version is acceptable (thank goodness for stock footage of wolves!), but the demons in the caves were a bit of a letdown. The final one and a half episodes, a courtroom drama in the city of Millennnius, tends to be a bit too long winded, but the ending is nice and satisfying. Some dramatic elements I remember as being particularly punchy and effective from the novel unfortunately don't come across that well on screen. The best example I can think of is Arbitan's murder at the end of episode one - on screen it looks like bad Shakespeare! However, the Voord are an interesting alien species - it's a pity they only appear in the first and last episodes, and the non-appearance of William Hartnell in episodes three and four allows the story to focus on the other members of the TARDIS crew - Ian and Barbara in particular. ""The Keys of Marinus"" is bubblegum Dr Who - enjoyable, but don't treat it as anything grand or deep.",974246400,,2235,4.8077922077922075
1025945,4,6305438420,"As a Dr. Who fan I had to watch this story.

1025951,4,6305438420,"This is a different style of adventure for the Doctor in this story. He and the Companions have to complete a deadly quest to save the planet Marinus. This story is basically a bunch of stand alone mini-adventures that each get a piece of the key which is needed to activate the ""Conscience of Marinus"".

The later ""Key to Time"" story line with Tom Baker from 1978-79 is the same style of quest plot although that is stretched out per story over the entire season rather than the more compact per episode as done with William Hartnell in 1964.

The Doctor is absent from episodes 3 & 4 due to Hartnell taking a vacation. This in part weakened the story for episodes 3 & 4 and in addition, Carole Ann Ford probably did one of her worst performances as Susan in this adventure which also helps knock down my rating of this story. I enjoyed the quest theme immensely however so I will give this story a 4 star rating even though it probably deserves a 3 star rating.",1444176000,,963,4.374301675977653

1025953,3,6305438420,"Keys of Marinus is a bold and imaginative idea. It's a six part-serial that is five interlinked stories centered around the TARDIS crew's quest for the Keys of Marinus. Thus, we have two different science fiction stories, a jungle adventure, an ice adventure, and courtroom drama/detective story. It's a brilliant experiment but doesn't hold up well due to many of the sets production values, and guest acting that was spotty to say the least.

Still, I enjoyed the production for its sheer boldness and most of the episodes were enjoyable enough (except for the Jungle episode.) The acting of Jacqueline Hill stands out as holding together several episodes. Her performance throughout the story (particularly in Episodes 2, and 4-6) really highlight how great a character Barbara was. The Doctor is great though he disappears in Episode 3 and 4 so that William Hartnell can go on Holiday.

Keys of Marinus also would have later influence in Doctor. Terry Nation, who wrote this, also would write, ""Genesis of the Daleks"" which would feature the Fourth Doctor using a Time Ring to travel through his companions which resembled the Travel Dials in this story, and the story also may have been an inspiration and pre-cursor for the Key to Time which used similarly inter-connected stories. Overall, this showcases the ambition and imagination of Doctor Who's early creative team but also the limitation of their budgets.",1437955200,2,1418,5.081545064377682

1026117,4,6305438420,"Doctor Who:  The Keys of Marinus after watching The Beginning is a breath of air.  It's the next complete story on DVD following The Beginning and sees The Doctor and his companions continuing their adventure across space and time in the TARDIS.  They land on a small island made of sand and glass and get ensnared into an adventure against their will on a planet whose thoughts and emotions are being controlled by a machine

Why I like it:  The Doctor seems a bit closer to becoming something recognizable as the Doctor.  Ian is still pretty much the main character and The Doctor the one who jumps in at the last minute with the plan to fix everything.  The story here is also more engaging than the ones previous.

The Nitpicky:  There's a scene where Ian is struck in the back of the head rendering him unconscious...except that he's actually kind grazed in the back.  It's more amusing than anything else.  The other thing is for two whole episodes Hartnell is MIA.  This is evidently because he was scheduled to go on vacation.  The show doesn't necessarily suffer either.

Who should buy it:  As with The Beginning:  fans who grew up with the classic series or new fans wanting to dive into the classic series.  It's not a bad outing in the Hartnell era so if you've dabbled with the classic series and you're looking for a story arc of Hartnell's to experience his Doctor this might be a good place to start.  If you're just toying with the idea of watching the classic series you may want to start somewhere else though.

1026118,5,6305438420,"I love everything Doctor Who, and I say that because I understand that it can skew my opinion. Even the worst episodes I can find some merit in.  In my opinion this is a well written serial.  Written by Terry Nation, it was trying to follow on the success of the Daleks and was unable to do so in that aspect, but there are brilliant parts throughout it.  It also does a very good job of showcasing the companions and not just being about the Doctor.  There are not a lot of special features included, however what is on there are good.  A lot of people seem to give this serial a hard time.  It is the first time that Hartnell seems completely comfortable as the Doctor, and it might have been partially because this was the first serial that the writer had written a previous serial and so the writer was comfortable with who the Doctor was.  Just my thought.  Hartnell shines through in this episode, as well as Ian, Barbara and Susan.  Definitely worth owning and watching over and over again.",1384905600,,997,4.404371584699454

1026198,4,6305438420,"The Doctor and friends land on a small planet, on an island surrounded by a sea of acid.  They meet some interesting villains and make some new friends, and they have a number of adventures trying to hunt down ""the Keys of Marinus"" which are circuit boards to operate a mind-control machine at the center of the island's pyramid.  Their adventures take them through a land of illusions, a jungle where the plants are out of control, a snowy mountainside laced with a network of caves, and a great city.  There is even a courtroom episode where Ian is on trial for murder; only the Doctor can defend him, and only Barbara and Susan can piece together the mystery and catch the real culprit.

This is a single story-line containing six individual episodes from the first season of the Doctor Who program, starring William Hartnell.  Still several years before BBC went to color, so it is in black and white.  This show is so old that the credits still list the character's name as ""Doctor Who"" rather than simply ""The Doctor.""  If you look closely, there are a few places where the original footage had to be ""repaired"" by splicing in footage from other places, but if you aren't looking for it you won't even notice it.  For being so old and having survived the BBC's notorious process of erasing original material, the quality is pretty good.  (The special effects are not... because at this point the show's budget was still less than my weekly salary.)  This is also the first episode that actually shows the TARDIS materializing; prior to this all of the arrival scenes were shot from inside the TARDIS.",1371686400,2,1606,4.663120567375887

1026200,4,6305438420,"The Keys of Marinus is somewhat of a disappoint for many viewers.  You would think a nice long story written by Terry Nation would be a great, wonderful, interesting and keep you hooked.,  After all, he invented the Daleks.  Give him six episodes in which he writes a adventure where the Doctor and gang have to travel, visiting new regions of the same planet, interacting with different cultures, searching for the keys of the Conscience Machine to save the planet of Marinus.  What could go wrong?  Well....spoilers ahead.
By changing the setting almost each episode, we never get enough time to get the full effect of the new culture, new characters, or even take in the new landscape.  Most of the characters, even the brains in the jars, don't get much development.  Even the evil Voord get little development.  Were they a different race?  Were they a political party?  A gang?  Why is there a ocean of acid?  It is natural?  Was it man-made to defend the Machine?  How about the screaming jungle.  Is it really a jungle of plants or are they animal-plant thingies?  Why does Terry Nation think plants are not living things?  Are plants only living when they can move?  His science and ideas on how things work is just weird.
This also means they tried to do too much and tried too many ideas with not enough support in the form of money to do so.  They really pushed what they could do on their budget and it shows.  The Dalek city, from the Dalek story, was wonderful and detailed.  Here, it is if they were stealing aging sets from other shows.
Now, this is one of the first Doctor Who episodes I watched on PBS in New England, so I have a very soft spot in my heart of it.  So, while I am giving it a rating of four stars, a person who does not see it as a childhood memory would have every right to give it two or even, to be honest, one star.
Now, there are lots of extras but to be honest, like all DVDs, those don't help when the main feature sucks.  Frosting will not help a cake if you burnt it.  And the extras, while nice, will not save this story for most of you.  If you need it to complete you Doctor Who collection get it used.

Mind you, I think that would be a mistake.

Unlike ""The Beginning"" which offers a look into the origins of The Doctor and the Daleks, and unlike The Aztecs and The Sensorites which build the characters of Barbara and Susan respectively ... this story offers little in terms of overall structure of the Doctor Who Universe.

It's a story built on the concept of having to go around a planet and collect ""five keys"" that will operate some sort of doomsday device.  It is a very clever way of giving William Hartnell a vacation without interrupting the flow of the story (unlike The Sensorites when Barbara disappears).

1026283,3,6305438420,"This is a story from the very first season of Doctor Who. Unless you are a huge fan of the first doctor, a completist, or someone interested in set design on a shoestring budget I would give this one a pass. If your local PBS station didn't show the William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton stories, and you would like to see this story, I recommend you rent or borrow this DVD.

The basic story has the Doctor and his companions, Susan, Ian and Barbara, land on the planet Marinus. They land on an island in the middle of a sea of acid and meet Arbitan, who is the Keeper of the Conscience of Marinus. Arbitan needs to reset the conscience of Marinus and requires 4 keys to work the machine. He prevents the travelers from entering the TARDIS and forces them to collect the keys which Arbitan has hidden across the planet. The TARDIS crew encounter many interesting people, situations and creatures on their travels across the planet to collect these keys.

The story sounds interesting. It was written by Terry Nation. There are some lovely performances by the regulars and a few of the guest actors. There were some very interesting bits such as the Morphoton from the second episode, the living jungle, the interesting justice system in the final segments, etc. However, these very interesting snippets never really gel into a cohesive story, and seem more like a series of vignettes.

There are some very nice things in this story: 1) It is delightful to see George Colouris in Doctor Who. 2) The Morphoton from episode 2 are quite interesting and would have made a great villain on their own. 3) Ian and Barbara are given very good roles and are equal to the Doctor in trying to work out the puzzles that confront them. 4) It's fun watching William Hartnell having a grand time playing Perry Mason in the last two episodes.

These things can't make the story hang together better. The character of Susan is either hysterical, or on the verge of hysteria for most of the story. The story also doesn't make a lot of sense. I just kept coming up with more questions than the story even tried to answer.  (Who is Arbitan, and why is he in charge of the machine? Who or what are the Morphoton? Are they natives to the planet, does their influence spread far? Why didn't Arbitan do a little better job giving the travelers some clues to finding the keys, which are held in some very obscure places? Does that sea of acid spread over the entire planet?) I really wanted to like this story, but it just left me nonplussed.

As for the DVD itself, there have been other Doctor Who stories that haven't been stellar classics but the DVD had enough wonderful extras to make it worthwhile. Unfortunately, this DVD is extremely sparse on the extras. The main extra is a 9 minute interview with designer Raymond Cusick, which is wonderful. There is the obligatory option for watching the story with commentary, this was actually my favorite mode of watching the story. William Russell, Carole Ann Ford, Raymond Cusick and director John Gorrie are moderated by Clayton Hickman and it is a lively interesting discussion. There is also the option of watching the story with production notes subtitles. There is some interesting info, but it gets bogged down with some of the most boringly detailed minutiae (ex. ""This scene called for 6 legal pads, 3 pencils, 2 cups, a book, and a beat up cupboard with a lock""...).

So once again, if you are new to Doctor Who and want to watch some of it's earliest episodes, don't start here. Why don't you give ""An Unearthly Child"", ""The Daleks"" or even ""The Aztecs"" a try if you want to see early stories from the show's first season. If you are a Doctor Who fan, but haven't seen many of the early stories, go ahead and watch it, just don't expect too much.",1268265600,9,3784,4.588757396449704

And if that description doesn't throw you off, you'll probably enjoy it.  It has better writing than many American TV shows produced at the time, and it has lovable, B-movie plot.  Dramatically, it lies halfway between the heaviness of ""Battlestar Galactica"" and the ironic humor of ""Burn Notice"".  The acting is solid, with notable performances by William Hartnell (The Doctor), Jacqueline Hill (a strong heroine for the 60's), William Russell (knight in shining armor without an ego to match), Francis de Wolff (the guy you hope doesn't come to your door at 3am), Donald Pickering (the prosecutor you don't want at your trial) and Stephen Dartnell (dictator in-waiting with brains and ambition).  The action is... well, if you are a fan of Old Time Radio, where you are forced to imagine how exciting everything is... you're more than ready.

Despite this movement, there are some minor areas of padding, and the plant life that attacks Barbara and Ian in the jungles of Marinus are not quite as convincing as one would hope for.  Still, a fun story, with some decent extras!",1264723200,,945,4.523529411764706
1026289,4,6305438420,"""The Keys of Marinus"" is on paper a sweeping outer-space epic.  The TARDIS crew is solicited by a man named Arbitan -- the keeper of the Conscience of Marinus, a robed figure living in a pyramid on a deserted island surrounded by a sea of acid.  Arbitan's played by George Colouris, who was part of Orson Welles' repertory and who had a role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizen-Kane-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00003CX9E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.  So in the first part of this six-part story, the principal guest actor brings great gravitas to proceedings.

Then our heroes are sent across the planet in search of the hidden micro-keys that will reactivate the Conscience machine and set Marinus to rights.  They travel to such terrifying locations as the Screaming Jungle and the Snows of Terror.  They're imprisoned in a Velvet Web, and then later, in a fine ""Perry Mason"" pastiche, Ian is framed for murder and it's up to the Doctor to act as his defense counsel.  This reads great on paper, as the novelization (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-and-the-Keys-of-Marinus/dp/0426201256/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who and the Keys of Marinus</a>) demonstrates.

So, how could this story go wrong?  Well, a low budget, for one.  The DVD release of ""Marinus"" looks fabulous -- the original videotapes for this story have long since been destroyed, but the existing kinescope transfers have been restored to a pristine VT look.  Unfortunately, that process doesn't serve the story well -- with ""Marinus"" already well known for tons of technical errors, it's hard to look at this DVD for 45 seconds without spotting a stray stagehand or a roaming boom shadow or a wobbly set.

The writing isn't great, either.  For ""Doctcr Who""'s second adventure into outer space, Terry Nation was brought in on short notice (following a string of canceled scripts) to recapture the success of ""The Daleks"" (available in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Beginning-Collection/dp/B000CNESV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - The Beginning Collection</a>).  He fails.  The story's biggest logical flaw is that Arbitan himself hid each key in an inaccessible location -- and then never tells his hand-picked agents how to overcome those traps.

The audio commentary to ""Marinus"" adds a lot of flavor.  The director, John Gorrie, was from the BBC plays department, and this was his only foray into ""Doctor Who"".  However, his inexperience was offset by that of designer Ray Cusick, who'd been largely responsible for the success of ""The Daleks"" just a few stories previously.  Surviving original cast members William Russell (Ian) and Carole Ann Ford (Susan) recall details about their characters 45 years after the fact.  It's all moderated by ex-""Doctor Who Magazine"" editor Clayton Hickman.  Similarly, the text commentary track ably matches dry production details with a keen eye for pointing out on-screen bloopers.

The last word belongs to Cusick, who in this disc's lone featurette, describes point by point the budget shortfalls that led to his ingeniously minimal set designs... and who then, when asked what about this story he'd keep,if he had to do it all over again, says ""nothing"".",1263859200,8,3386,5.770623742454728
1026290,2,6305438420,"This production was an unmitigated disaster on multiple levels, and yet it still holds some charms for the Doctor Who fan who has acquired a taste for this sort of thing. If you're looking for an introduction to classic Doctor Who or even to the first Doctor, run (don't walk) away from this DVD. You will only find yourself staring at the screen in disbelief, muttering, ""My God, why?"" But if you've already purchased every other William Hartnell entry in the series, you might find this one instructive.

""The Keys of Marinus"" was the first Doctor Who story scripted by Terry Nation with no Daleks in it, so it was predictably a mess: an episodic six-part hodgepodge in which the Doctor and his companions are whiplashed from one incongruous setting to the next, all purportedly on the planet Marinus. The story opens, for example, on a glass island surrounded by a sea of acid, then moves on to other regions of the planet. So where does the acid sea end, and how does it affect these other locales? At the same time, however, the veteran fan will recognize in short form the same basic formula that would later be used in multi-story arcs like ""The Key to Time"" season.

Next, set construction for this story was a fiasco, not for want of trying by set designer Raymond Cusick but for want of cash from the BBC. When the companions find themselves inside a mountain of ice caves, for instance, I thought, ""Sheesh, it looks like papier-mache wrapped in cellophane."" Sure enough, as Cusick reveals in a hysterically funny interview in the Special Features menu, the cave walls were covered in cellophane to make them shine like ice. (Cusick's deadpan account of how he had to pull the story's scenery out of his backside with almost no money is the reason I give this DVD two stars instead of one. Don't miss it.)

Finally, the acting and characterization in ""The Keys of Marinus"" are as erratic as the story: Susan (Carole Ann Ford) breaks down in hysterics even more easily than usual. William Hartnell seems listless in the early episodes and, in fact, took a two-week holiday in the middle of the story. Ian (William Russell) gives everybody their orders for defeating the Voords in the final episode, making one wonder who's in charge on this show. And the numerous villains are uniformly dull and undeveloped--always a bad sign in a series known, even at its worst, for its memorable baddies.",1263427200,6,2400,4.70952380952381

The Dcotor and the others are split up and must find the  seven keys to activate it.

1026376,5,6305438420,"I was a bit weary before I watched this episode, because I heard mixed reviews, but I was amazingly impressed with this story. I don't watch Dr. Who for the set designs or props, but for the character and story.  Usually the story is outrageously chataclismic or absurd, and thats what I like about the different directions the Doctor takes in the Tardis. There are no limits with the Doctor, he can go anywhere and do anything really (because come on, very rarely does he fail). However, this takes some imagination, especially when looking back all the way to the 60s in some cases.

Here, though, I found a classic Doctor Who adventure story  creatively written by Terry Nation of The Daleks. We land on a glass strewn island surrounded by acid, which is insane.  How crazy is that, honestly, poor Susan almost went for a paddle in it! And unlike later seasons, the sense of awe and discovery is still fresh in all the characters, each constantly amazed by their ever changing surroundings.  Ususally I find it hard to sit through 6 episodes, but when each episode takes us to a unique, and original location, it felt like a great old time movie.  The sets aren't as fantastic as the plot, but did anyone ever really think they were, even back when it first aired? I don't think realism is really the point of Doctor Who. Try using your imagination. Immerse yourself in the original storyline and plot twists, and you'll have one of the best Doctor experiences ever.",1098144000,,1469,4.630769230769231
1026377,4,6305438420,"Landing on the planet Marinus, with acid seas, and a glassy beach, the First Doctor, Ian, Barbara, and Susan, are forced by Arbitan, the sole inhabitant nearby, to go on a mission to hunt down four keys that will help him redress the power of good on the planet.  The Conscience of Marinus was a machine built to ""eliminate evil from all men.  Robbery, fear, hate, violence was unknown.""  Then came Yartek and his Voords, who overcame conditioning and are out to take over the Conscience.
Using travel dials, wrist teleporters, they go to where the four microcircuit keys are, first to the luxurious city of Morphoton, ""sensuous, decadent, but pleasant"" with kind hospitable people.  Yet is all this luxury real?
Accompanied by Sabetha, Arbitan's daughter, and Altos, her love interest, the Doctor has the brilliant idea of splitting up.  He goes to the civilized city of Millennius, while Ian and Barbara search a place where the vegetation is very dense and ""when the whispering stars, it's death.""  Altos and Sabetha land on an icy area where they encounter a trapper Vasor, who isn't all he seems.  On Millennius, Ian is falsely accused of murder and the Doctor becomes Sherlock Holmes in order to save Ian.  A city where one is guilty before proven innocent cannot be all that civilized.
Ian shines the best in this story, as he comes out as reliable, trustworthy, and brave.  One of his best hours.  The interplay between Barbara and Susan remains.  Susan trusts Barbara to tell her what she heard in the forest in the same way she tells her of the hand that touched on in the petrified forest in The Daleks.  Barbara's her usual reassuring self here.
George Coulouris (Arbitan) is best known as the man who takes Kane from his parents in Citizen Kane and as the doctor in Murder On The Orient Express.  Fiona Walker (Kala) would reappear in Who's 25th anniversary story, Silver Nemesis as Lady Peinforte.
The ultimate theme of this story is given in Doctor's final piece of advice to Sabetha:  ""I don't believe that man was meant to be controlled by machines.  Machines can make laws, but they cannot be made to preserve justice.  Only human beings can do that.""
William Hartnell did not appear in Episodes 3 and 4 so he could take his holiday, yet he was credited for both episodes per his contract.  A similar thing would also happen to Jacqueline Wright in The Web Planet a season later.
The Keys Of Marinus is interesting in that many concepts of the show later found its way to future Who stories.  For example, the search for the four keys was expanded in the six Key To Time stories of 1978-79.  The concept of the Conscience as a machine that bars evil, plus the five microkeys with a permutations of numbers and symbols was revisited in The Keeper Of Traken.  An acid pool is also encountered in The Web Planet.  Vegetation tha attacks appeared in The Seeds Of Doom.  And it was written by the Chief Dalek himself, Terry Nation.  Thank goodness this Hartnell story survived the BBC purge, because it's well worth it.",1042761600,4,3032,4.679245283018868
1026378,5,6305438420,"It is quite difficult to write an adequate review for this particular adventure, considering that it is a wonderful adventure, but the TARDIS crew are constantly moving from one place to another within the confines of these 6 episodes.  But it is definitely a very ambitious quest type of adventure, with the Doctor and company being blackmailed into helping Arbitan retrieve the four micro circuit keys that would reactivate the Conscience of Marinus, in order to stop a group of alien terrorists, the Voords, from subjegating the planetary populace with the machine.  Their first stop takes them to Morphiton, a place where people seem to be the most friendly and content in the universe.  But it is soon revealed to be a charade, as it is clear that strange disembodied brains have subjegated the people into slavery.  But soon they are defeated, retrieve the key and are joined up with Altoss and Sabetha, a young couple that were on the same quest, but came under the influence of the powerful brain creatures.  Their travels take them to a living jungle, and to an artic landscape, then to the city of Millenius, where their laws are that a person is guilty until proven innocent, not the other way around.  And soon Ian is framed for a crime of murder and theft, in which the good Doctor comes to his aid to solve the mystery, in true detective like style.  I like this particular portion as it displays a brief courtroom drama type scenario, which is always a good thing.  Finally, their adventure brings them back to the island, where they find Arbitan dead, and the Voords in charge.  But they soon trick the creatures into destroying the machine that would have allowed them to conquer Marinus, just before the Doctor and company travel on to their next adventure.  I definitely recommend this to any and all Dr. Who fans.",1042761600,,1833,4.735849056603773
1026379,5,6305438420,"I enjoy writing these reviews as I am able to look back to when I originally saw these stories as a child in England when they were broadcast the first time. Looking at them now with the constant reminders of the advances in technology on and off the screen it is easy to forget how revolutionary this series was at the time.
This story was one of my particular favourites. Originally broadcast in April 1964 this was the second story to be set on an alien world. The show's creators clearly wanted to pack in as much science fiction as they possibly could and this is particularly true of this six part adventure.
When the Tardis materialises on a beach it does not take too long for the intrepid travellers to discover that the sea is made of corrosive acid and the sand is made of glass. The Voords are reminiscent of Eygptian jackals and alas it is the aliens who are the bad guys. Marinus has an overall concept which is then sub-divided into four sub-plots.
In the first, the Doctor and his companions arrive at a part of the planet where it seems that every whim or desire can be fulfilled. The truth, however, is much different, and they discover that the brains of alien creatures have outgrown the need for physical bodies but still require physical activity to be done by brainwashed Marinian slaves.
The second segment of the show drew on the notion of sentient plant life while the third was sited in ice-caves. The fourth involves the trial of Ian for a murder he did not commit and where the Doctor is his advocate. Finally the story comes full circle as they return with new friends to the start of the journey to discover that things are not as they seem.
In a sense, the story does not work as the sub-plots are not that substantial. In another sense, this story is the mould that is followed much later in the 'Key to Time' stories where it is handled much more adroitly. The 'Keys of Marinus' does contain some good ideas and certainly kept the young audience glued to the set throughout the six week run.
This really was a great concept at the time and I know that I had a great time watching it.",1020556800,,2117,4.41687979539642

Not to be outdone tho, I snuck an old portable B & W TV into an attic room and watched most of the old episodes. I found ""The Keys of Marinus"" to be a much more entertaining story than I expected or remembered. The Acting was good for the most part, and except for some rather bad models in the begining, the effects and costumes were very good.
