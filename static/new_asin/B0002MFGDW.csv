2104268,5,B0002MFGDW,I have never seen a Wacky Races episode but i have the game on Sega Dreancast and on PC. As soon as it comes out I will buy it in a heartbeat and I hope you will too!,1090886400,,166,3.3947368421052633
2104269,5,B0002MFGDW,"October 19 brings a promising release of Wacky Races, the series where many different characters compete in races in their custom cars. Sadly I don't think Cartoon Network plays these shows anymore so many kids may not know what this is. Adults will remember it though and it certainly is a show the entire family can enjoy. The characters:

Luke and Blubber Bear in the Arkansas Chugabug

The Slag Brothers, Rock and Gravel, in the Boulder Mobile

The Gruesome Twosome in the Creepy Coupe

Professor Pat Pending in the Ring-A-Ding Covert-A-Car

The Red Max in the Crimson Haybailer

The Sarge and Private Meekly in the Army Surplus Special

The Ant Hill Mob in the Bulletproof Bomb

Peter Perfect in the Turbo Terrific

Penelope Pitstop in the Compact Pussycat

Rufus Ruffcut and Sawtooth in the Buzzwagon

Dick Dastardly and Muttley in the Mean Machine

The show follows a similar pattern: Dick Dastardly and Mutley cheat every way they can to win but never do, and Muttley always laughs about it. Different riders would win on each episode, often with dilemmas within the race (mostly caused by Dick Dastardly/Muttley). It is a simple but fun show that I loved watching and I am glad we are getting the complete series of 34 episodes on dvd. There look to be good extras included on here, and each episode has been remastered to look better than ever before. Amazon's price of $[...] is a steal for what you get so I encourage fans of 60s/70s animation as well as first-time fans to pick this bargain up. It is fun for the whole family, old or young. Episodes listing of the show:

1 See Saw To Arkansas

Hope this convinces you to buy this set, it looks to be a great release of some classic animation from the 60's and 70's.",1090540800,96,2613,4.473347547974414
2104270,3,B0002MFGDW,"The reason I didn't give it five stars is not because of the show which I love and one of the best cartoons growing up in the 70s. It's just that I thought I was getting the foldout box set as I got with other Hanna Barbera cartoons, but instead I got the plastic snapper case. So it doesn't quite go with the rest of my collection, also what I got was manufacture on demand dvd rather than a regular dvd. You can tell by the DVD being a pinky colour instead of silver. The picture is still great, it's just annoying that no where on this ad did they say that's what I'm getting. As for the shows on the dvd for some reason they have made each segment a separate episode instead of the two segments per episode which made the half hour. Also annoying. I wish WB got an actual fan of the show to put this together. But other than that I've enjoyed reliving Wacky Races. Colourful and great characters.",1503100800,,900,4.17816091954023
2104271,3,B0002MFGDW,"The price, and the content are a great deal. The set is well worth the price.  But im disappointed in the manner in which the producers of the set, put them together. They play the opening titles, then one episode, and then the closing titles. They totally left out the middle bridge sequence, where the drivers are tuning up their car... it doesn't appear anywhere in the set! Almost as if the guy who put this together, never actually saw the show, as it was aired. I wish i could find someone who has a good copy of the middle bridge, and so I could re-assemble the shows correctly.
But Im happy to have the cartoons, and the image quality is fantastic. Its a great set.",1502928000,5,673,4.341269841269841

2104287,5,B0002MFGDW,"Even with a whole bunch of well-defined race cars and characters, things were never confusing.  The ""Wacky Races"" were never dull with the colorful characters doing everything and anything to win each race in different parts of the US., especially the ever cheating Dick Dastardly trying to dishonestly scheme his way into victory which never happened. Muttley's snickering was the exclamation point to Dastardly's backfiring cheating maneuvers.  Funny entertainment with a group of memorable racers.

There was a planned game show element in the series that did not happen (contestants trying to pick the winner of the race before the cartoon stories were shown) that explains the inclusion of the game show producers Merrill Heatter and Bob Quigley (The 1960s-1970s ""Hollywood Squares"", the 1970s ""High Rollers"", and ""Gambit"")  in the end credits.",1466985600,,849,5.409090909090909

The races all take place in different parts of the country each episode and, now as an adult watching this show, I can really appreciate the detail and creativity that went into making this cartoon.

I was always a big fan of the Slagg Brothers in the Bouldermobile (car #1) as a kid, but these days I can't help but appreciate the genius and interplay of Paul Winchell's Dick Dastardly and his faithful sidekick, Muttley.

They are a bit ""samey"" which shouldn't be too surprising given the premise (hey it's a race) and the number of characters (ten car and driver combinations) but they are fun to watch. Maybe these wouldn't work too well with the sophisticated kids of today but as a reminder of other days and accepting the limitations of plot and animation these are still wonderful.

Let's not forget that Southern Belle, Penelope Pitstop in her Compact Pussycat. So many cars, so many wacky races and so many dirty tricks from Dick Dastardly.

The only thing wrong with the show is that Dick Dastardly ALWAYS lose. I know he cheats but still,he has to win once in a while. I think that's one of the main reasons why this show only lasted one season. The Predictable Dick-always-losing ending. At least on Yogi's Space Race,the villain from that show won even if it was only 2 times. The other thing wrong with the show is that it's also riddled with stereotypes like Penelope Pitstop(The Southern Belle),Luke Bear(The Hillbilly),The Ant Hill Mob(1940's Mobsters),Sgt. Blast(Loadmouth Sgt),Pri. Meekly(weak & scared private) and last but not least Peter Pefect(The Proud Showoff). Overall despite it's flaws,it's still a pretty good for kids to watch.

2104376,5,B0002MFGDW,"Wacky Races was something I grew up watching on the USA Cartoon Express in the 80s.  As such, it became a cartoon I looked forward to seeing every week.  The characters within the series are totally unique and no two are alike (though some are similar....Dastardly/Muttley)  However, the premise of the cartoons were so simple that they were easy to be followed.  Each week, the different racers would be racing from one part of the world to another.  Similarly, each week, the characters had to put up with the cheating antics of Dick Dastardly and his assistant, Muttley.)  Of course, in traditional cartoon fare, the bad guy usually lost.  ;)

This DVD Set did not fail to live up to my expectations.  The cartoons are still as funny as they were back when I'd watch them on the USA Network.  The characters are still as funny as ever:  (as a side note, my favorite character was always Professor Pat Pending because he could do anything).  The storylines are somewhat predictable with Dick Dastardly's plans always failing.  However, compared to cartoons today that seem to rely on politics and/or grossout jokes and cutaway gags, Wacky Races is a nice breath of fresh air.  It's also a really fun blast to the past.
Just as a side note, the following were the cars I used to/still root for:

Number 3:  Professor Pat Pending in his Convert-A-Plane.
Number 5:  Penelope Pitstop in the Compact Pussycat
Number 8:  Luke and Blubber Bear in the Arkansas Chug-a-bug",1263945600,3,1465,4.746031746031746

I also like the creative names of the episodes (See-Saw to Arkansas, The Great Cold Rush Race, etc.). I also enjoy the special bonus features, especially the featurettes about the making of ""Wacky Races"" & the spinoffs, ""Dastardly & Muttley & their flying machines"" and ""The Perils Of Penelope Pitstop"". I definitely love how the set is packaged in full-color & the two foldouts containing a group photo of every single wacky racer.

But buy this for the episodes themselves: as crazy as they ever were.  The plot is paper thin and is essentially a premise for sight gags, predictable villainy and of course a very, very fun race.  Don't expect 21st century animation, complicated stories or snarky pop-culture humor.

My nephew likes cars and race themes so this was great for him . We would each pick a car at the beginning of a show and see if we would finish in top 3 and he liked that.

2104405,4,B0002MFGDW,"The Wacky Racers ride again on this 3-disc set, the first in a classic Hanna-Barbera triptych consisting of WACKY RACES, DASTARDLY AND MUTTLEY IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES and THE PERILS OF PENELOPE PITSTOP.

At the time of this show's release upon the airwaves, Hanna-Barbera had come under fire from worried parents for the violence present in their adventure programs such as SPACE GHOST, BIRDMAN AND THE GALAXY TRIO, FRANKENSTEIN JR. AND THE IMPOSSIBLES, and THE HERCULOIDS. (Incidentally, we're still waiting for proper releases of these on DVD, Warner Brothers. Ahem.) HB responded with this series, which not only returned them to wild slapstick comedy as featured in YOGI BEAR and HUCKLEBERRY HOUND, but gave them their first recurring cartoon villains: the ignoble, treacherous, completely inefficient Dick Dastardly and his wheezing, snickering canine sidekick Muttley.

The plot of each episode is simple: eleven cars, each one a distinctly and fantastically customized vehicle (see other reviews for the complete lineup) compete in car races throughout North America for the title of The World's Wackiest Racer.  The rules seem to be highly flexible: each car has certain attributes that allow its owner(s) to gain the advantage from time to time, often in ways that would be considered unsporting in a real-life car race.  Despite this, Dick Dastardly and Muttley (voiced by Paul Winchell and Don Messick) still spend most of each race trying to win through extremely elaborate and badly-planned booby-traps (sometimes contributing heartily to their own demise: in the very first episode, D.D. has the race in the bag until the narrator (Dave Willock) mentions ""photo finish"" at which point Dastardly stops at mere INCHES from the finish line to pose for a photo).

Where the plot thickens is in the diverse range of cars and racers: though Dastardly, Muttley and Penelope Pitstop were the obvious breakout stars, this is Hanna-Barbera's largest ensemble cast (23 characters!), scoping a wide range of personalities; nutty inventor Pat Pending; hyperenthusiastic Rufus Ruffcut and his pet beaver Sawtooth; the incoherent cavemen Slag Brothers (Rock and Gravel); laid-back hillbilly Lazy Luke and his fretful pet Blubber Bear, and the ubitiquous Ant-Hill Mob, to name but a few.  The cars, all tailor-made to their racers, are excellently designed and the source of numerous gags: the Gruesome Twosome and their Creepy Coupe's ""dragon power"" with real dragon; the Compact Pussycat, which dispenses full salon conveniences to its owner Penelope Pitstop; and the Red Max's Crimson Haybailer, both car AND aeroplane in one.  There's even a bit of irony: bumbling Peter Perfect's Turbo Terrific falls apart constantly, while Dick Dastardly, whose Mean Machine is perhaps the fastest car of the lot, could have won a race if he just didn't stop to cheat.

The three-disc set is colorfully packaged with nice artwork featuring a group shot of all the Wacky Racers in the foldouts.  The discs themselves contain commentary on four episodes from noted personnel at HB and two featurettes detailing the history of WACKY RACES and a look at its spinoffs DASTARDLY AND MUTTLEY IN THEIR FLYING MACHINES and THE PERILS OF PENELOPE PITSTOP.

This package is a nicely conceived set, and showcases one of Hanna-Barbera's most fondly remembered series; its release can only mean that more of HB's finest is soon to come.  (Warner Brothers: please re-read the above. AHEM.)",1145836800,28,3463,5.255434782608695
2104406,5,B0002MFGDW,"Of all the cartoon series to hit the Saturday Morning lineup in the late 60's/early 70's was the Wacky Races. My brothers and I would race to the living room to watch it. I purchased a copy for my great nephew for Christmas (Don't tell him). When he comes to visit, all he wants to do is watch the Wacky Races with his great uncle Lonewolf.  Anyway, the Wacky Races is a brilliant cartoon show with lap after lap of action and fun for kids of all ages. It may sound wacky. But, for the Nascar fans this is a great time killer for when the racing season ends. The race at Watkins Glen is kinda like the Wacky Races. You've got drivers doing anything possible to win a race. But, instead of like the #2 car of Rusty Wallace or the # 8 car of Dale Jr., (Sorry #24 or #20 fans there's only 11 cars) you've got #2 the Creepy Coupe or the #8 Arkansas Chug-a-bug.

2104408,3,B0002MFGDW,"Hanna-Barbera's cartoon show ""Wacky Races"" premiered on CBS at 9:30 AM EDT Saturday September 14, 1968 , and was subsequently blackballed by the TV watchdog group Action for Children's Television. Because the show was bankrolled by game show producers Merrill Heatter and Bob Quigley (NBC's ""Hollywood Squares""), ACT president Peggy Charren charged that the show enticed children to make monetary wagers on the outcome of each race. Hogwash. I took the over/under on how many times Dick Dastardly's machinations would backfire on him.

In actuality, the original premise of the show was to have children write in to predict who would win each of the thirty-four races, with prizes given to drawn winners, but CBS nixed the idea. ""Wacky Races"" was principally devised in response that that superhero cartoons that permeated Saturday mornings over the previous two seasons were too violent. For all the atypical Hanna-Barbera standards of limited animation for 1968, ""Wacky Races"" still stands as classic cartoon slapstick from a more innocent time before double-entendres and grossouts became cartoon standards. It would spin off two shows the following year--""Dastardly & Muttley In Their Flying Machines"" (the first known cartoon where the villains are the stars) and ""The Perils Of Penelope Pitstop.""

Eleven cars with a veritable spectrum of offbeat drivers race cross-sountry from point A to point B, each race with a connecting story sandwiched. Sight gags and visual surrealism permeate, and with any Saturday morning, they're hit or miss. With Dastardly, many of them are hits (literally and figuratively). Warner Home Video has released the entire series on a three-disc set. And it's a hit-and-miss affair as well.

On the hit side, it looks as fine on disc as it did when the show first aired. It's got three bonus features, including a look back at the show by designer Iwao Takamoto, voice Janet Waldo, character designer Jerry Eisenberg (whose dad, Harvey Eisenberg, drew many H-B comics for Dell/Gold Key in the early 60s), and contemporary artist Scott Jeralds. On the miss side, instead of each half hour program as CBS aired it, the cartoons are broken down into 34 individual episodes. This means, no mid-point interstitial asking viewers to stay tuned for part two (featured once as an extra). Also, the episodes are as Cartoon Network aired them, which means the end title narration by Dave Willock (the announcer) and Paul Winchell (Dastardly) is gone save for the end of the episode ""Ski Resort Road Race.""

However, the hits outnumber the misses here, and it's a blast from the Saturday morning past.",1122854400,39,2623,5.150234741784038
2104409,4,B0002MFGDW,"As the intro starts, it brings back all those memories. Penelope Pitstop ( did anybody else notice she dials - hair, but the robot does her lips) Peter Perfect, the Professor and others start the next wacky race. There are 34 episodes ( it always seemed to go longer on TV) on the 3 discs + plus some extras.

As much as watching the DVD, being able to reminisce about times spent watching on TV. A great trivia question is to get the friends to remember the names and numbers.

My two boys ( six and four) have taken to watching them, with us choosing who will be the winner ( however my suspicion is that they have been fastforwarding the episodes to find out who wins - before we watch them :-))

Just further proof for the boys ( and me) that good animation doesn't have to involve  people turning into monsters, using magic or violence to be entertaining.

Go on, treat yourself and watch the Anthill Mob in their bullet-proof booommb, Professor Pat Pending in his convertor car along with Penelope Pitstop (the glamour gal of the gas-pedal!) - and watch Dick Dastardly get his just desserts as Muttley quietly snickers to himself... yeh yeh yeh! (eyebrows double-raise!)

2104414,2,B0002MFGDW,"Nice to have the wacky racers back, all the 34 episodes in one DVD. Nonetheless one comment : on the back cover it states that this DVD is ""standard version presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of their original television exhibition"" I'm not that sure as after viewing the entire dvd all the cartoons seem to have been trimmed a bit on each sides of the screen. This is very unnerving for a ""collector edition"", so much for quality...",1106956800,4,448,4.54320987654321
2104415,5,B0002MFGDW,"I couldn't wait to get this DVD and it did not let me down! The quality was so clean that I was amazed that it was from 1968!!! My 5 year old son immediately fell in love with the Slag brothers and it was so cool that I could share the joy from this show with him!!! Boys love racing competitions and seeing a clear winner and this show was right up his alley!!!!

The concept was simple but it was still so fun to watch and root for your favorite driver!!!

I'm not sure what the previous guy was looking at,...but the quality was fantastic for a show that is 37 years old!!

This is a MUST have for any serious animation collector!",1105228800,5,633,4.088709677419355
2104416,5,B0002MFGDW,"I used to watch this show when I was a kid, and I must admit; Hanna Barbera cartoons are still the best cartoons ever made!

Even if the drawings are sloppy and the plot is the same in every single episode, it still is fun to watch! Can't wait for 'Dastardly And Muttley In Their Flying Machines' to be released. Way to go Warner Bros. for releasing these classic cartoons on dvd (finally!). Too bad they aren't released in Europe!",1105142400,,431,4.3875
2104417,5,B0002MFGDW,"Wow...a lot of people remember this show even though like a lot of Hanna-Barbera's stuff in the late 60s it ran for only one season of new episodes and a couple years of reruns...though thanks to channels like Boomerang the show lives on in all its slapstick glory. This is not ""trash"" cartoon entertainment, the show was full of cool sight gags and it was always fun to see Dick Dastardly become a victim of his own treachery...and if the show was a failure -- as one reviewer put it, and he didn't even know how many episodes were produced -- no one would have asked for it to be released on DVD! Wacky Races spawned not one but TWO spinoffs a couple of years later. A LOT of H-B series had surprisingly few episodes -- two dozen or so of The Jetsons originally, 25 of Jonny Quest, 30 of Top Cat...I would hardly call any of those shows failures at all with the number of folks who've remembered them and turned their kids on to them. Scooby Doo Where Are You in its original form only ran 25 episodes! This is not trash at all...it's classic cartoon entertainment that proved you didn't have to spend millions of dollars on the animation to make something that would be ebjoyed for years...and anyone who's got to spend time to actually trash shows like these is taking things FAR too seriously! Lighten up and have fun, that's what this stuff is all about. If I want to watch something that serious, I'll go rent Schindler's List (insert Muttley laugh here). This is great stuff meant to be enjoyed!",1104364800,6,1503,4.449275362318841
2104426,5,B0002MFGDW,"for those of us who are old enough to remember Wacky Races, it was a blend of slapstick with strange characters. Everybody knew DD would lose, the question was how would he screw it up. The set has all the episodes and interesting commentary from key members from the HB team. It's also mentionmed that the two spinoffs Penelope Pitstop, and Dastardly and Muttley, are coming out on dvd",1103587200,,386,4.608695652173913
2104427,5,B0002MFGDW,"FINALLY. This is a great show. I remember watching this when I was little and I liked it so much. I hope I still like it as much. Anyone that's a fan of cartoon network shows should get this 3 Disc set. It has all 34 parts. There are 2 parts per episode and each episode is 25 minutes long. Your getting a lot here for a little bit of money. You will be satisfied with this if you're a fan of cartoon network or Hanna Barbera shows.

2104428,4,B0002MFGDW,"My three year old loves this show and can't get enough Wacky Races.  But Warner Brothers is misleading the public into believing the series ran longer than it actually did.  In fact, each half-hour episode contains two cartoons and the series ran for one season of 17 episodes, not 34 episodes as is advertised.",1100217600,4,311,4.7407407407407405

2104430,5,B0002MFGDW,I love Wacky Races and have for as far back as I can remember. The episodes are still funny 36 years after they first were shown. If you love classic Hanna Barbera then pick this set up!,1098316800,,186,4.054054054054054
2104431,3,B0002MFGDW,"I loved this show as a kid.  Something about all those characters, all those cars, and the slapstick humor of it kept me coming back for more.  I was very excited to hear this classic show was coming to DVD as a complete series set.  Yes, the animation is more in line with the Hanna-Barbera output for TV from the 50's and 60's, but that's the time it was made.  And, yes, the film could have been cleaned up a bit better (the colors are nice, but you see the occasional scratch and such go by).  One the flip side, the extras are very cool - both the look back at the series and a look at the spin-offs (both which I hope make DVD too).

Recommended for older fans and young kids.",1098230400,5,682,4.090225563909774
2104432,5,B0002MFGDW,"When I heard that ""The Wacky Races"" was coming to DVD, I jumped for joy. I hadn't seen these cartoons in decades...and thankfully I was not disappointed. The cartoons have been digitally restored with brilliant color and sound. You'll snicker along with Muttley as he and Dick Dastardly try to cheat their way to the finish line. Each race is goofier than the last! Lots of silly puns and play on words! Lots of goofy fun and plenty of nostalgia!",1098144000,25,446,4.5875
2104433,5,B0002MFGDW,"Wacky Races was Hanna-Barbera's hilarious cartoon spoof of the 1960's comedies ""The Great Race"" and ""Those Daring Young Men in their Jaunty Jalopies"".  The characters are all here; the perfect hero, the lovely damsel, the wacky inventor, the evil villain, plus an assortment of new characters including cavemen, gangsters, monsters, a WWI flying ace, soldiers, a hillbilly and his pet bear, a lumberjack and his pet beaver, plus many more.  I must admit that the scripts are a bit sluggish now that I'm an adult (a bit repetitious and far-fetched), but what the heck...it's a cartoon for goodness sakes!  This and George of the Jungle were the two reasons that I stayed inside on Saturday mornings.  When it comes out..RACE to the store to get your copy!",1095120000,6,754,4.913385826771654
2104434,4,B0002MFGDW,"""The Wacky Races"" was my first favorite cartoon as a child. I anticipate getting a chuckle out of this collection, but what I would LOVE to see is ""The Perils of Penelope Pitstop"" on DVD! Both are cult classic Hanna-Barbera non sequiturs, like nothing they had done before or since. These eclectic toons seemed to almost give up on the idea of narrative altogether and just relied on bizarre design and great voice work by the likes of Paul Winchell, Paul Lynde, and Mel Blanc at their best. Pockets, get out the DVD player!",1092787200,7,524,4.585106382978723
