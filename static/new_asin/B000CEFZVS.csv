8098068,4,B000CEFZVS,"Was surprised how well Douglas Chamberlain's Duchess worked. Interplay with SSF favorite Eric Donkin was good. Mise en scne, casting and choreography all pleasing. Can almost forgive the dated Canadian current-event references and the garish makeup for the Grand Inquisitor, played by the recently passed Richard McMillan, whose over-the-top G&S performances foreshadowed better things to come. This video comes closer to the high quality of the Mikado, under the same festival series and director. Must review the Pirates DVD.",1494979200,,527,5.6835443037974684
8098069,1,B000CEFZVS,it was not what I ordered. I ordered what was shown as a dvd but what arrived was a tape. Useless for my music system.,1404086400,,118,3.76
8098070,5,B000CEFZVS,"I saw this production on television when I was 15 - that's 23 years ago. I always remembered it - mostly because of the comedic acting, I admit. Douglas Chamberlain, in drag as the Duchess, is particularly wonderful, but there is so much else that is also brilliant.

I cannot recommend this production enough. Hearing it again now, I am staggered at the extremely high quality of the really gorgeous singing and the orchestra.

The orchestra is beefed up a little, with the inclusion of what sounds like an accordian, and a snare drum in certain places. There has also been some extra music included - but it all works wonderfully and adds to the story and comedy.",1288569600,,665,4.627118644067797
8098071,5,B000CEFZVS,"This Gondoliers is a splendid production by the Stratford Festival of Canada in 1986 and it's a pity you can not get it on DVD.
The Australians completely copied this production in the 90's, very amusing too, but this one is more sparkling, more witty, in beter sound- and video quality!
But be aware you get the real Canadian video and not a copy of an older 1982 CBC-Fox production!",1237680000,2,384,4.5
8098072,4,B000CEFZVS,The Gondoliers is not a great operetta - but this production is outstanding.  It contains a lot of very clever choreography and comic operetta does not get any better than the final scene.,1223683200,,188,4.696969696969697
