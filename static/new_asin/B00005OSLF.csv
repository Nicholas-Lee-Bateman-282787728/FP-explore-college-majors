7949086,5,B00005OSLF,"Sega's take on the magical girl anime genre is undoubtedly the best. You've probably seen Card Captor Sakura and Sailor Moon, but Saint Tail AKA Meimi Haneoka puts all those other magical girls to shame. Her personality is much stronger than Serena's/Sailor Moon's, and her escapades with Asuka Jr. are full of both humor and intrigue. Sega does a masterful job of holding our interest in the series by setting two characters up for a romance and then frustrating that chance for happiness with everything that could possibly come between them. This series is a must-have if you are a true Sega fan! In this collection, Takamiya AKA Rina - a cute but overly aggressive girl and the central antagonist by far - is introduced as a rival for Saint Tail. The name of this collection (It's Show Time) is Memi's catchphrase when she uses her magical powers as Saint Tail. This DVD collection is the second of six and contains the following episodes:

Episode 4 - I Hate Wedding Veils!
Saint Tail is after a wedding veil to stop a wedding?! Or is she bringing true love together for a friend?

Episode 5 - Legend of Happiness?! The Clock Tower Commotion
A wonderful amusement park! A special clock tower! And a doll in distress! Saint Tail comes to the rescue!

Episode 6 - New Student Rina, A Formidable Enemy
First Asuka Jr. is constantly after Saint Tail, but now a new student named Rina as well?! What's a girl gotta do to get a break?

Episode 7 - A First Rendezvous of Tears?!
Saint Tail goes after an ancient dagger of legend, but suddenly there are tears and an embrace!",1264204800,2,1572,4.5836298932384345

After watching this, I completely fell in love with the series. It's a cute, fun magical girl series with some romance!
If you like Sailor Moon and Cardcaptor Sakura, I highly recommend getting this, it's one of my faves!",1086480000,,353,4.363636363636363
7949088,5,B00005OSLF,"I was a little surprised when I found out how much of a difference there was between the DVD and the VHS. What I mean by that is- in the set-up in menus, for subtitles,if you have it on, then there's subtitles in the whole movie{I'm talking about it when the language is in English}!! And if you don't have it on, then there isn't any subtitles for the theme song {the opening one}, the title, or in the episodes{occasionly}. And that doesn't happen in the VHS. So if your a person who likes to watch the VHS more than the DVD and always buy the Saint Tail vhs rather the dvd, then you may want to wait to buy the vhs, but if you're a person who can't wait to find this is vhs then buy this in DVD.
In the first episode:
A girl is supposed to marry someone she doesn't even know who gives her a wedding veil. So Saint Tail returns the veil to the person who gave it to the girl. But the girl is in love with someone-Asuka Jr.
In the second episode:
A girl loses a doll that really belongs to her friend at Wonder Garden. So saint Tail has to get the doll back before the girl sees her friend again. And not only that, but some crooks try to switch the priceless statues at Wonder Garden for some fake statues.
In the third episode:
Saint Tail steals a painting that was tricked into being donated to the museum by the man who works there. But now Saint Tail has to worry about someone else who wants to capture her- Rina Takamiya!!!
In the fourth episode:
Saint Tail steals a fake dagger that was put on display.",1072396800,,1512,4.128813559322034
7949089,5,B00005OSLF,"I just got done watching this one, so it's pretty fresh in my mind.  Well apart from the first DVD, this one was much better, even thought the plot lines are still a little cheesy they are somewhat better.  But this time Saint Tail and Meime(they're the same person) have a rival for Asuka Jr.'s love.  The new girl Rina who is also the mayor's niece.  Even though I don't think Meime has anything to worry about considering Rina is such a brat and acts so boyish,(in my opinion) I'm sure you would probably agree, but either way you see Meime's true feelings starting to come out for Asuka Jr. (If you don't know who he is, he's a ""detective in training"" per say, cause his dad is a detective, and the mayor gave Asuka Jr. the case on catching Saint Tail who is supposedly belived to be a theif but in reality she's only protecting the people that have been treated unfairly-like kind of like a used car salesman--sorry it's a little tricky for me to explain). But that's the only reason Asuka Jr. is chasing after her, but during this time she's fallen in love with him and I'm pretty sure he has too, but I don't want to ruin it, you gotta see it for yourself. Hope this helps!!!",1005609600,2,1182,4.3108108108108105
