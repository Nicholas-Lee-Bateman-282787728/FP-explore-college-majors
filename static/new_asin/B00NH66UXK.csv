8678184,5,B00NH66UXK,"The concert captured on this Blu-ray, of which I received a review copy, begins with a simply hypnotic Parsifal prelude. Conductor Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic don't let it lag for a second, maintaining a taut tension from start to finish. It's both gorgeous and spiritual.

The Brahms violin and cello concerto, the great composer's final orchestral work, was new to me. Others more familiar with the piece love this performance, so I'll defer to them. I'm afraid that after an initial hearing I found myself siding with Brahms' contemporary critics, who considered the work cool and cerebral. Because the double concerto was not initially well received (even by the musicians who premiered it), Brahms decided to scrap his plans for a second one featuring the same instruments.

Upon watching this once more, I started to warm to the piece, particularly in the slow second movement and the concluding third. The first movement still seemed twice as long as it should be, but who am I to question Brahms? By the way, the soloists here -- Lisa Batiashvili on violin and Truls Mork on cello -- execute their end of things sensitively and faultlessly.

I have no mixed feelings about the Brahms Symphony No. 4, which I've heard many times and is an essential work by any standard. Suffice it to say that the performance captured on this disc is as good as any I've heard, lovely and dramatic. It's paced perfectly by Rattle and played expertly by the orchestra. To my knowledge there's currently only one other performance of it on Blu-ray (unviewed by me), and I can't imagine it surpasses this one.

The picture quality of this Blu-ray is quite sharp and detailed. The sound is exceptionally good, providing full delineation of the orchestra's textures. That's perhaps even more surprising when you consider the unique venue is a former industrial facility: the 19th century Oberspree Cable Works building in Berlin. As always, you'll want to switch from the PCM Stereo default to DTS 5.1 to fully capture the benefits of high definition surround sound.

8678185,5,B00NH66UXK,"This disc is outstanding throughout and well up to the standard of the best of this series of Europe concerts given by the BPO. The concert program has deliberate and considerable links with the orchestra's history as the Parsifal Prelude was included in the very first subscription concert in 1882 and the two pieces by Brahms have been core repertoire for much of the orchestra's lifetime. In this case the performance was dedicated to the memory of Rostropovich.

The concert starts with the slow-moving but sonically sumptuous Parsifal Overture by Wagner as referred to above. This is well suited to the orchestra's sound world, requiring sumptuous textures allied with clarity of detail and sustained over long, drawn-out phrases. This is a very satisfying reading and also serves to illustrate the apparently fine acoustical properties of the Power and Cable factory in Berlin.

The concert then continues with a particularly satisfying performance of the Brahms Double Concerto. The disc is worth buying for this alone. The two soloists, Lisa Batiashvili and Truls Mork share what seems to be a very natural and instinctive musical rapport and this lifts the performance of this closely integrated work onto a completely different level to that which is often achieved. There are moments of sublime beauty to be found in each movement but the finale is notable for concluding the work in a notably joyous manner. This is music making of a very high order and the generally forward pacing is strikingly effective.

The concert concludes with a deeply satisfying performance of the Symphony 4 and, as always, there is a great deal to be gained by watching an interpretation or performance unfolding before our very eyes so to speak. The music has been deeply embedded into the orchestra's sub-conscious for years with many memorable recordings of different characteristics to its credit. The equally fine but contrasted recordings by Karajan and Abbado are testament to the orchestra's ability to adjust and still deliver music making of excellence. That tradition or ability is here continued with this latest fine account from Simon Rattle which is characterised by an enhanced sense of drama and drive balanced by a keen sense of sensitivity in the less dramatic sections. The wide ranging emotional delivery of the final movement is a good example of this range of expression and brings the symphony to a particularly strong and exciting conclusion.

The sound provides excellent spread and fidelity in DTS 5.1 and there is also the usual stereo option. The imaging is crisp in the usual HD manner and gives good colour and tonal depth.

This is a particularly fine disc in every respect and is fully deserving of serious consideration from collectors. The improvement offered by this blu-ray over the DVD is like that of a veil being lifted and this applies to both the imaging and the sound.

Potential purchasers should note that his disc is available either as part of an advantageously priced four disc box set listed under the conductors name or as this single disc issue. Those who already own part of the contents of the box set (Waldbuhne 2007 & 2008 plus Europakonzert 2007 & 2008) would be best advised to continue with the single discs while those who have none of the discs need to consider whether the box set or the single discs offer the best musical /economic option.",1416614400,4,3393,4.9964601769911505
