6548375,5,B00M262LLQ,I was riveted from the gripping first scene. A horrifying scenario evolves into a difficult situation which evolves into a sense of hope and a positive future.  I can't wait to watch it again.,1438732800,5,192,4.647058823529412
6548376,4,B00M262LLQ,"A very dramatic, not pornographic in its details, exploration of the tensions and exploitation of a subclass both predator and prey. Lovely to watch if just for the lovely typically French turn the story takes.",1437955200,,210,5.0285714285714285

6548378,5,B00M262LLQ,"This one is going straight into my top 10 pile. I challenge you to find a clich anywhere in this film. A man in Paris falls in love with an orphan Ukrainian rent boy who is dangerously enmeshed with a gang of serious thugs.  Lots of hoops to jump through to get through their mess. Excellent film & sound quality. Decent subtitles. Excellent acting by a very diverse cast. I've said this before in reviews, but this is another one of those films that really highlights how pathetic our American Gay films are. Lack of skin or softcore is totally not missed.",1436832000,18,557,4.46078431372549
6548379,5,B00M262LLQ,"Not a film for everyone, nor a film for all indie movie viewers. It belongs in a special class of LGBT films that are fictional realistic. There are seedy dealings going on behind everyday life, cultural idiosyncrasies that separate people's behaviors and reactions, and complex relationships that evolve beyond sex to something more familial.

I did not buy this movie for the sex or the cute guys, I wanted to get a new perspective, which this film would offer. It does deliver on that and it shows some very interesting truths about human nature. For what it is, I give the movie 5 stars; I truly did love it despite what it lacked in fancy camera work or dramatic build up; real life has very few dramatic moments, which is what makes this a realistic portrayal rather than a standard formula scripted production While I do like scripted movies too, but I am rating this for what it intended to be rather than what others want it to be. Just an opinion from a gay movie viewer..",1435104000,8,982,4.548022598870056
6548380,1,B00M262LLQ,"an incredible waste of time and money. never knew a film could be this bad -- disjointed, poorly staged and photographed with boring performances from everybody in the cast. what was the director's  point of making such a silly shallow film?",1433980800,3,241,4.878048780487805
6548381,3,B00M262LLQ,"The story is good and believable. The characters were believable. But the lighting in much of the movie was so dark you could see
little of what was going on. It was hard to tell who was who.",1433980800,5,191,4.052631578947368
6548382,5,B00M262LLQ,"When there is so much not to like out there it's pure pleasure to get entertainment, action, stimulation, and an excellent story all in one package. The acting is superb. The filming keeps the viewer intrigued and the director unveils the story in layers. Some strong characters and more than impressive performances kept me on the edge of my seat to the end. Buy it, rent it, and enjoy it. It's good when entertainment achieves it's goal; it's extraordinary when it succeeds.",1433635200,5,476,4.817073170731708
6548383,4,B00M262LLQ,"Around the Gare du Norde railway station groups of East European lads gather and seek opportunistic chances for an easy buck. Daniel Muller (Olivier Rabourdin `Of Gods and Men') is a gay man who is attracted to one of them - he is not sure if they are for rent but approaches Marek and a date is arranged at Muller's apartment. Only when he answers the door he is not prepared for the visitor he gets.

That is the start and what develops goes way beyond what I was expecting. We have quite a few issues being explored here from migrant integration, crime, pay for sex and affairs of the heart. I was at times feeling uncomfortable, angry, concerned and even happy. The main thing is that it is always engaging.

Great performances from all the cast but Olivier Rabourdin was totally convincing and Krill Emelyanov as Marek as the confused yet caring Ukrainian was brilliant. This is for those who enjoy an intelligent gay themed film, but a lot of the issues here are very universal and as such I can highly recommend.",1427500800,13,1019,4.532608695652174

6548396,4,B00M262LLQ,"An unexpected start, a touching film with lots of subtle feelings, which pushed me to a surprising, while expected ending. In spite of those unexpected events, this movie made me feel very good....that's surprising!",1453680000,3,215,5.352941176470588
6548397,4,B00M262LLQ,"Anyone who has been to Europe recently and been confronted by the catastrophic immigration crisis will get this film immediately. Others might struggle to appreciate the development of the relationship between the two main characters, and the tense political situation in France that is the background of the story. It's extremely slow moving - and at times unnecessarily so, but the performances are top, and it slowly pulls you in. The only issues I had were with some plot holes that remained unexplained, and some unconvincing love scenes. There are also  a few questions left unanswered regarding some characters choices, but if you're interested in serious cinema with something to say, this is a slow burning, moving, gay themed drama that will stay with you.",1452297600,2,766,5.128
6548398,5,B00M262LLQ,"I really enjoyed this movie and walked away from it with a great feeling!  Extremely well done!  The acting was fabulous.  The young man (boy) in this movie was absolutely gorgious!  I knew nothing about this movie when I sat down to watch it, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  I love watching gay movies because I love to see two young men interact with each other.  I like watching sex senes, but i don't just watch gay movies for the sex alone.  And, unfortunately, a lot of the gay movies i have seen in the past, many of them had unhappy endings; either someone dies, or the 2 men that interact end up breaking up.  Well, this movie had two main actors interacting, a very very attractive young man, and an older man.  At first, that turned me off, with the older guy.  But he ended up playing a great role in the movie, and fit into the part just perfectly.  The movie had an excellent plot, sex senes were just enough throughout the movie but not overwhelming, and the movie had such a great ending!  I am really pleased with this movie and highly recomend it.",1446508800,5,1084,4.259803921568627

6548401,4,B00M262LLQ,"The film is a well produced film, it has the light rumor and seriousness of a well made film well combined in the story. Thinking of how the Eastern block is now free and can be like their other European counterparts, it is amazing that they went through the acceptance of gays as easily as they did. I would recommend the film to anyone interested in seeing something of quality and a real story unfold, a sotry close to reality and yet not your everyday love story.",1443312000,3,467,4.379310344827586

8669769,5,B00M262LLQ,"This is an excellent, compact film, which addresses the relationship that develops between young recent east European and Russian immigrants and a middle aged frenchman in modern urban Paris.  Unlike most ""gay"" films, this screenplay avoids stereotypes and is carried forward by a plot that mixes tension, humiliation, intimacy, abusive robbery, and the dynamics of the pyramidical structure of immigrant groups who live on the edge of a society that forces them to live off their wits on the edge of urban life.  The film is very subtle, which separates it from a typical ""gay film society"" offering, and also strongly endorses the moral authority of older men in guiding youthful gay men towards satisfying and emotionally authentic relationships, not simply relationships constructed around sexual contact for money, product or attention.  There is a not a moment that doesn't work in this suspenseful and surprisingly sophisticated film.  The most misleading element of the film is the picture on the DVD cover which is blase and common and does not convey anything about the film's content.  This film is an excellent view overall and a contribution to the  understanding of what humanization of the 'con' can do to transform an immigrant from an amoral and careless person, unconcerned with their long term fate, to someone more cautious, authentic and heartfelt.  Strong positive recommendation; one of the best new films depicting the effects of the  influx of young Eastern Europeans (not just men, by the way) on French society, particularly on the individual who lives alone, which accounts for some 40% of urban French men and women in this era.",1516838400,2,1657,5.156716417910448
8669770,3,B00M262LLQ,"Not particularly polished as a film, and as a result, not that believable. The main actor seems strangely distant and unaffected by what is happening, especially in the ""home invasion"" scene. There doesn't seem to be any real reason behind his change of heart, and very little emotional aspect to the boy's character. We don't get much character development of any sort. In short, it isn't affecting because it isn't believable.",1516320000,,428,5.042253521126761

Marek (Kirill Emelyanov) is part of a controlling street gang in Paris, France. They hang around the Gare du Nord train station. One of the Eastern Boys tells him to go inside the station. Marek waits under the stairs and then is met by Daniel (Olivier Rabourdin), a French businessman. Marek is a prostitute here.  He comes from Ukraine, Russia and has lost his parents. Marek agrees to meet Daniel only at his home at 6:00pm tomorrow.
  That day, Daniel waits anxiously. The phone rings and he tells him what floor and apartment. At the door, is a smaller boy Beka Markozashvili). Daniel says he doesn't know him. The boy says he is Marek and pushes his way through the door. He yells at Daniel not to touch him and that he is 14 years old and this is illegal.  The gang of Eastern Boys then enter the apartment and look around. This is followed by four more boys including a girl and the leader of the gang they call Boss (Daniil Vorobyov). They look for a security alarm. Boss demeans Daniel for having a gym machine and calls him out of shape and old. Boss takes his shirt off and starts dancing to music on the computer. The gang is bothering Daniel's belongings, playing his video game, using his liquor and messing with the ice machine of his refrigerator. They won't leave and Daniel feels helpless. The gang parties in the apartment. Two of the boys steal his gym machine. They have a truck waiting. Then Marek, the prostitute, shows up and Daniel is not pleased to see him. A fight begins between Boss and one of the boys and smashes him through a glass table.

8669772,1,B00M262LLQ,"There were too many technical issues with this film.  No matter how I adjusted my DVD player, I could only get the first 5% of the film in English; after that, everything was in French or Ukranian (yes, there were subtitles, but I always avoid such films because I consider subtitles too distracting).  Another reviewer mentioned the lighting, and I completely agree...it kept oscillating back and forth between normal lighting and lighting that was way too dark.  As for the story itself, it was a bit too gritty for me.",1467676800,2,521,4.766666666666667

8669775,5,B00M262LLQ,"This film, as it gradually unfolds. beautifully reveals how the need for basic sexual satisfaction can evolve into an unexpected love that transcends an intended transient sexual encounter. Set in Paris, we first see a group of Eastern European boys freely roaming the streets apparently bent on some sort of mischief. Their activity is carefully monitored and viewed by a middle aged man named Daniel. Finally, he is given the opportunity to approach one of the youngsters who is momentarily alone and apart from the others. Daniel propositions the youth who tells him that his name is Marek. After considerable effort, Marek gets Daniel to reluctantly give him his home address which is located in an expansive high rise apartment building. They agree to rendezvous there later. When the appointed hour arrives, Daniel opens his door to whom he thinks is Marek. Instead, he is confronted by an aggressive young man of 14 who gained entry by saying that he was Marek. What follows is an onslaught of the entire horde of Eastern boys which, as the DVD cover states, ""is certain to contain the most unforgettable home invasion scene ever committed to celluloid"". Daniel's home is stripped bare. But that is really only the beginning of our story. Soon after the pillaging of his domicile, the real Marek shows up once again at Daniel's door.  He is truly upset over what happened to Daniel and still offers himself sexually for a price.  Daniel accepts the offer. What follows is an unexpected and evolving love story that must be kept secret lest it be destroyed by the other European boys should they find out, especially by their leader simply known as ""Boss"". How all of this plays out should keep the viewer on the edge of his seat as the action rapidly accelerates leading to a tension filled but most satisfying  and unexpected climax. Kudos to the actors who respectively played the roles of Daniel, Marek, Boss, Phony Marek, and a female supervisor in a hotel.",1462665600,6,1968,4.851190476190476

8669777,3,B00M262LLQ,"Weird story line, but it is a feel good love story.  I didn't like how the young toughs wrecked that older guy's apartment, but after that lousy beginning, the story moves in a more hopeful direction.  The Russian kid is really cute and fairly convincing in his role.  It gets a bit graphic in places, though not too overdone.  In brief the story moves from sex trade to a strange sort of love connection, and it does not have a tragic end, like so many 'gay' films have in the past. The personality of the Older guy is pretty strange, but he finally seems to come alive towards the end of the story.",1456790400,5,600,4.283185840707965
