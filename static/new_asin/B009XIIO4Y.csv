8545068,3,B009XIIO4Y,"The music is fantastic. The surround mix sounds good. However, the 2.0 PCM files are not the 24/ 96 they claim to be. I've just inspected them, and they're all up sampled garbage. Some were just 16 bit depth, up sampled to 24, while others have a bunch of reused, repeated bits to make them appear to be 24 bit files. More Monster snake oil nonsense. These guys are such idiots, they really deserved to lose their company.

While the surround mix is nice, it also is probably similarly falsely advertised. The software I used to check the 2.0 files can't analyze 5.1 files.

Regardless, you'd probably do better to pay less and simply download the hi res audio version of the album for less money, if you really care about the way it sounds.",1474934400,,741,4.481481481481482
8545069,4,B009XIIO4Y,First time I've owned this music in any thing other than LP.  This product is giving me the opportunity to revisit and rediscover what is moving about the music.  Its clean and present.  Lovely.,1472169600,,194,4.647058823529412
8545070,2,B009XIIO4Y,"This Monster Music DVD disk while recorded in DTS 5.1 surround, does not appear to have the .1 base sound track, as our sub-woofers do not automatically turn-on, as they do with all our 5.1 surround DVD discs, including DTS and DVD-A encoded discs, using our Oppo BDP-105 and BDP-103 disc players. Another recent purchase also produced by Monster Music 'Lee Ritenhour's 6 String Theory' plays as it should with its sub-woofer track clearly evident. Has anybody else experienced this lack of a subwoofer channel on this disc?",1469318400,,524,4.965909090909091
8545071,5,B009XIIO4Y,"A most enjoyable sound experience.  The music is amazing... Gil Even's arrangements are world class.  Miles plays exceptionally too.  The 5.1 surround mix is well done from an original 3 track recording.  The techniques used are well described elsewhere.  If you are on the fence, I would get one before they disappear and you have to pay too much for one elsewhere.  At times, it was like sitting in the middle of the room as it was being played.  I was taken away with the music in a way I never was before with the original mix.",1436313600,2,531,4.412371134020619
8545072,5,B009XIIO4Y,Perfect!,1417564800,,8,8.0
8545073,5,B009XIIO4Y,The sound is awesome! Really brings a good sound system to life and if you didn't know; Miles is a genius.,1395014400,2,106,4.095238095238095
8545074,4,B009XIIO4Y,"This is a worthwhile surround disc, but why can't 'Monster' just call it what it is, a DVD with a DTS 96/24 surround remix of the album and a higher-than-CD-standard stereo remix? 'SuperDisc'? 'Monster High Definition Sound (HDS)'? As if we needed new meaningless acronyms. It's DTS, people, what's the harm in letting people know that?

Ironically, their eagerness to suggest that they've minted a brand new format will only cost Monster customers since they're only sowing confusion as to whether one's home hardware will play the disc. Guess they're worried that it won't be consistent with their main biz of overhyped wiring if they don't buzzword it to death.

The booklet claims that they manipulated the 3 original tracks into 19 to then mix to 5.1 surround but did it ""...without processing and with absolutely no digital software"". So the 3 tracks underwent some kind of spontaneous audio mitosis and split into 19 tracks I guess. I'm not sure processing means what they think it means, but whatever.

But I do like the music and the mix.",1389744000,3,1047,4.870786516853933
8545075,5,B009XIIO4Y,"A great version of a fantastic album. For those who are familiar with this Miles Davis and composer/arranger Gil Evans project prepare to fall in love with it again.
For the unfamiliar prepare to be blown away! The Spanish influenced arrangements come to life in this 5.1 format. You really feel like you are sitting in the middle of the orchestra with Miles' haunting trumpet floating in front of you. And don't forget to check out the hi-res stereo version included in the package, a audiophile treat. BTW, the disc is a standard DVD-Video (not DVD-Audio) that will play on any DVD player. Go into your home theatre put it on, turn of the lights and prepare to be transported...",1381190400,5,680,4.675
