5185284,5,B008VL082A,I had this story narrated by Meryl Streep for years on VHS and I was thrilled to be able to get it on DVD.  It's a favorite for the holidays and I can't wait to share it with my little granddaughter when she's old enough to watch it.  Meryl Streep does an amazing job and it is a treasure.,1359244800,,289,3.8813559322033897

5185290,4,B008VL082A,"Nice music provided by lithe Chieftains. Slow paced illustrations with smooth voice provide a mellow, soothing story at end of a busy day!",1388016000,,138,5.043478260869565
5185291,5,B008VL082A,this is a very lovely story and a reading by a young meryl streep. but i did miss the beatrix potter drawings.,1387843200,,110,4.045454545454546
5185292,5,B008VL082A,Absolutely magical. Can't imagine any child or adult not enjoying this beautiful adaptation of this classic story. We all loved it.,1385683200,,131,5.285714285714286
5185293,4,B008VL082A,"With the Chieftains wonderful music and the amazing Meryl Streep reading the story by Beatrix Potter, and even lovely vintage-style drawings (though more color would have done wonders for the visuals), this was a nice gentle Christmas story with just a hint of the fairy tale elements. I think children would be bored by this, because it is all about a tailor sewing a coat, but I liked it because it had such a nice cadence and choice of words. Well-written by the famous author of Peter Rabbit, and other stories for children, this is more of an adult fairy tale because of the length of it and the old English words for fashion elements that would be unfamiliar to children.",1383609600,,677,4.603305785123967
5185294,4,B008VL082A,"My four-year-old was disappointed at first that this was not a movie, just a ""story,"" but she was soon entranced and moved to tears because Simpkin had no dinner. I enjoyed the music.",1378252800,,183,4.575757575757576
5185295,4,B008VL082A,"I enjoy reading aloud to my family and being read to, and Maryl Streep does a great job of reading the story. I watched it when I didn't feel well and found it very soothing.  The artwork contained little vivid color, but the washed out effect accurately portrayed the tailor's life of poverty and  enhanced the story.",1365120000,3,318,4.56140350877193
5185296,5,B008VL082A,The story is similar to the tailor and the elves with the elves being replaced by mice.  Merryl Streep narrates this with such an engaging variety of different voices one forgets its her.  The story takes center stage as the knowledge of who narrates it falls away.  Great sound effects and visuals.,1364947200,,299,4.711538461538462
5185297,1,B008VL082A,"I had seen a great video when I had my kids and this was not it.  This was simply a bunch of pictures with someone reading and the pictures were not very engaging - pretty washed out.....

If you are looking for a book on video....basically screen shots of a book page with someone reading and some music, then you'll love this.  But that was not what I was looking for.

There is another video - animated - very well done!  But this is not it.",1360368000,,444,4.116279069767442
8530989,5,B008VL082A,"This is a well-done rendition of this beloved Beatrix Potter book. The music from the Chieftains sets a proper mood, and Meryl Streep's
voice is unbelievable Every little detail springs to life, delighting or mesmerizing. I think the drawings could have been a little better, and
yet some of those are excellent, too, especially in setting moods! I love this little film.",1481587200,,371,5.0
8530990,5,B008VL082A,GREAT product. Just as described!!!!,1469577600,,36,6.4
8530991,1,B008VL082A,I have this movie on vhs and it is in color and a wonderful movie. This one can't compare to it.,1454803200,,96,3.619047619047619
8530992,5,B008VL082A,Told so well and the music is exquisite. Enchanting.,1446768000,,52,4.888888888888889
8530993,5,B008VL082A,I wish you had more of these to watch. BEATRICE POTTER'S stories are truly wonderful!,1443484800,,85,4.733333333333333
8530994,5,B008VL082A,"A charming tale told by one of the best actresses of our time.  If you have child who likes being read aloud to, this is perfect.  It's not animated except for a few details, but beautifully illustrated.  I could say its appeal is mostly for younger children, but I am sixty-two years old and enjoyed this gentle tale and lovely pictures.  It's only about a half hour long so watchers don't need the lengthy attention span a movie requires.  Perhaps I am old fashioned, but if you don't have time to read aloud, your conscience can remain clear about letting your kids watch ""The Tailor of Gloucester""  --ever so much better than most modern cartoons.  Hint: Because my husband is deaf, we always have closed captioning turned on.  It occurred to me that if you have children learning to read, the captioning gives them the opportunity to read along as the story is told.",1436054400,,871,4.6103896103896105
8530995,4,B008VL082A,"Very sweet take! It took a few minutes for my nine-year-old nephew to get acclimated, but he enjoyed it. I found the music to be lovely and the narration top-notch.",1435968000,,164,4.5
8530996,4,B008VL082A,Sweet,1435276800,,5,5.0
8530997,5,B008VL082A,"It doesn't get better than Meryl Streep's voice. Artfully done, simple and captivating for my little ones.",1433721600,,106,5.294117647058823
8530998,5,B008VL082A,It's a lovely old story and the music is perfectly matched to the words and illustrations.,1424476800,,90,4.6875
