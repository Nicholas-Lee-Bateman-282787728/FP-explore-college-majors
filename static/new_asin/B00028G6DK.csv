8023706,5,B00028G6DK,"Republic Pictures along with VCI Entertainment has released two more winners of the long running ""Red Ryder Double Features"" ~ this fifth volume has recurring roles for William ""Wild Bill' Elliott as Red Ryder, Bobby Blake as Little Beaver and Alice Fleming as the Duchess (Reds Aunt) ~ both films from the mid '40s are exciting with interesting and diverse storylines.

On this first Ryder B-Western ""Colorado Pioneers"" (1945-B&W-54 mins), the plot summary is about a couple of bad boys in the big city, Freddy Chapman and Billy Cummings have taken the wrong path of crime, with the help of Roy Barcroft (King of the Badmen) who always looks for the easy way to make a buck ~ never fear Red Ryder (Elliott) and Little Beaver (Blake) come up with the idea to rehabilitate the boys on the Ryder ranch ~ tune in and see if the Ryder family can turn the boys from the dark side to the side of good and ranch life.

The second film on this double bill is ""Wagon Wheels Westward"" (1945-B&W-56 mins), a theme that's been used in previous B-Westerns, wagon train of settlers arrive in a ghost town that is unknowingly headquarters for a gang of outlaws ~ what would a Ryder Western be without Roy Barcroft (King of the Badmen) ~ Barcroft is the leader of a group of henchmen working a con game against innocent homesteaders ~ another plot surfaces with Linda Stirling trying to hold off George J. Lewis (both actors appeared in ""The Tiger Woman""-serial 1944) who wants to tell her husband Jay Kirby (all three actors appeared in ""Zorro's Black Whip""-serial 1944) about Stirling's dark past ~ Republic's stock ace stuntmen come up with some of the best fight scenes ever caught on film ~ great film directing from R.G. Springsteen and entertaining screenplays by Earle Snell both top notch Republic Pictures staff personnel ~ Elliott as usual is outstanding as Ryder, with some hard riding segments on his horse Thunder, displaying Wild Bill's signature style.

If you enjoyed this volume the next twelve volumes will have you roped and hogtide ~ the Red Ryder Double Feature Series is a must have for all of us who grew up riding the trails with Fred Harman's newspaper comic strip character which was popular during 1936 to 1964 --- during that time I discovered Dell Comics and the stories and artwork of Harman's hero Red Ryder --- now on DVD we can relive those early days when Red Ryder, Little Beaver and the Duchess made the west a safe place live --- B-Westerns reigned for all the little cowboys and girls who made a trip to the local theater to watch their favorite hero Red Ryder ---Western Classics, all my heroes have been cowboys!
