8716663,3,B00XV31SW2,"The Holy Moly Christmas Story Collection is just that--a collection of 4 short animated sketches that tell the story of the first Christmas:
 The Angel Speaks to Mary
 Mary & Elizabeth
 Jesus is Born
 The Wise Men Follow the Star

Cute animation style and a cast that speaks the same language as Charlie Browns mom. Charming and it actually works--its surprising how universally our gestures can communicate across linguistic bounds, and tell a clear story.

I only wish I had been able to preview this material or find informed reviews before purchasing it. (As it turns out, it is available to watch on the wearesparkhouse YouTube channel, but I didn't know that at the time of purchase.) Ultimately, it didn't meet my needs because of the liberties it took with the actual Christmas story. I was hoping for an enjoyable, yet true-to-Scripture piece that I could show at an outreach Christmas party for un-churched kids. Some of them may not have heard this story before, and I wanted to offer them a version that would not confuse them by adding things that didn't really historically happen. Theres enough confusion between fact & fiction for kids surrounding the Christmas holiday already--right?

My main beef with how SparkHouse Family presents the Christmas story here is in how the angel Gabriel is presented. In this version, he bumbles his message to Mary the first time, so he has to return to heaven & is sent back multiple times to get the message straight. He re-appears to greet the shepherds in episode three, and continues to be shown as stupid & clumsy. I know of no nuances in the Biblical story that would suggest this depiction of Gabriel.

I have actually been pleased with the other Holy Moly animated sketches that I have watched. Thats why this one caught me off-guard. Not what I was expecting, and Im sorry I spent money on it.",1450224000,2,1855,4.775
