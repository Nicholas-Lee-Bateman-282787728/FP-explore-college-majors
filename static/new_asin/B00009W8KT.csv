7993558,5,B00009W8KT,"Again...Mr. Watkins is an amazing man, who is truly in love with Christ. I can't get enough of this CD. I love his unselfishness by including others who love the Lord just as much as he does.  Truly God is pleased. I hope one day I will get to meet and greet this man who pours his heart out to our Lord and Savior so beautifully. May The Lord continue to use and Bless this man.

7993559,2,B00009W8KT,"What can I say . . . I really like Harvey.  I really like the Canton Spirituals & have one of their DVD's.  I even have this album but, I didn't really get into this one.  When I watched it initially I skipped through it to the songs that I wanted to hear & I haven't watched it since then.  I really didn't like the commentary between the songs nor all of the ""acting"" on stage during the songs.  I wanted to feel as though I was at the show & I didn't.  I really only like watching him sing Grateful & that is about it.  Anybody want to buy this back from me?",1210809600,2,561,3.8684210526315788
7993560,3,B00009W8KT,"A Harvey Watkins Jr project without the Canton Spirituals? Not bad, but, the spirit of the Canton's is not there. Some really good songs though. Just a little too slick for me.",1206576000,,176,4.53125
