903639,5,6304628153,"Long before Indiana Jones, there was another dashing archaelogy professor who tussled with the Nazis. PIMPERNEL SMITH, released in 1941 and alternately titled MISTER V, is an updating of THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, with the backdrop of the French Revolution being swapped for that of pre-World War II Europe.

Berlin, during the spring of 1939, and rumors rage up and down the Third Reich, of an uncatchable mystery man who boldly rescues eminent artists and intellectuals from Gestapo persecution and concentration camps. This, even as the German propaganda machine engages in blustery denials. Meanwhile, Horatio Smith, prim and forgetful English professor of archaelogy, undertakes a seemingly innocuous tour of Germany with six of his students. Except that their first few stops coincide with daring prison break-outs which were effected near their vicinity. However, it takes the professor garnering a bloody wound before his students finally catch a clue...

Now introduce a beautiful girl who works with the Gestapo against her will, and the tense cat-and-mouse games really begin.

Leslie Howard, in all the films I've seen him in, has never been less than very, very good (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel/dp/6305066825/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Scarlet Pimpernel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pygmalion-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780023536/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pygmalion - Criterion Collection</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Petrified-Forest/dp/B0006HBV2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Petrified Forest</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-In/dp/B00007ELDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand-In</a>). PIMPERNEL SMITH, a movie Howard himself produced and directed, provides a grand and showy platform for his wonderful talents. His Professor Smith is very British and stiff upper lipped, but with a dose of unexpectedly sneaky humor. This movie meant a lot to Leslie Howard.

It helps a lot, of course, that the movie also serves as a taut and rousing adventure thriller, with plenty of sequences in which the unassuming, cerebral hero outwits his enemies silly. As his impulsive American student admiringly tells him: ""I guess you're one of the goodest guys in Creation."" But PIMPERNEL SMITH is also graced with many sly moments of Professor Smith tweaking the nose of his German foil, the cunning and bombastic General von Graum, who is this film's version of Citizen Chauvelin. The imposingly corpulent Francis Sullivan is terrific, lending a jaded flair to his von Graum, who makes it his mission to nab the very clever professor. Sullivan's battles of wit with Howard provide some of the film's best moments. Mary Morris is also quite good as the lovely and reluctant Nazi agent, Ludmilla Koslowski, who manages to ensnare the Professor's misogynistic heart.

Mood and lighting enhance the film. The film-noirish cinematography makes excellent use of light and shadow, two wonderful examples of which are when Professor Smith is revealed to his students to be the daring man of action and also near the end as Smith, in brooding shadow except for his gleaming eyes, defiantly condemns the German war machine to von Graum's sweaty face. The film looks very atmospheric, yet is enlivened by occasional moments of humor (Shakespeare apparently was German!). By the way, I totally dug the scarecrow scene (and, really, Howard should've expanded on that sequence quite a bit more; you'll see what I mean). I'm not much of an expert, but I can't help but feel that Leslie Howard was well on his way to becoming a director of some note.

Except he wasn't with us for very long. He was 50 years old when, in 1943, his plane was shot down by German combat aircrafts. Some say, shot down purposely, with German Intelligence having knowledge of Leslie Howard, an indefatigable contributor to the British war propaganda, being onboard. If that holds even a germ of truth, it adds that much more resonance to this film. It bugs me a bit that Howard is probably best known mostly for his role in GONE WITH THE WIND, because he's done so much more than that. In my eyes, the man has left an indelible mark in cinema. I thought he was simply fabulous in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL and PYGMALION. But, even beyond that, his accomplishments in real life, for his people and his country, rank him as a patriot of the stiffest upper lip.

903641,5,6304628153,"A&E used to show this old movie every so often; the print was in awful condition and yet, despite its technical difficulties, Pimpernel Smith was a compelling film.  It was Leslie Howard's final film, his own personal project, an anti-Nazi propaganda piece designed to shore up his battered country's courage and offer hope to his beloved nation.  That it no doubt did, and yet Pimpernel Smith succeeds as a stand-alone movie and is in some ways superior to Howard's earlier turn as The Scarlet Pimpernel.

The film opens with a scientist doing important medical research being arrested and hauled away by the Nazis.  Rescue comes in the form of a mysterious man who whisks the researcher away from under his captors' noses.  The scene switches to an English college campus, where resides the eccentric Professor Horatio Smith, an archaeologist who fusses over his prized statue of Venus, is absent-minded, and dislikes social engagements.  His students think he's a few bricks light of a load and his superior is confused by him, and the only female he adores is his aforementioned statue.  In short, he's so harmless he's virtually a laughingstock.

However, Smith is in reality a man who uses his position as an archaelogy researcher to travel throughout Europe, and beneath the absent-minded veneer is someone with quiet nerves of steel.  Nobody realizes this, of course, not his unsuspecting students when he invites them to accompany him on a jaunt to search for traces of Aryan civilization, nor the Nazis, who view him with contempt as an annoying little English pest.  Only one person believes Smith to be the elusive rescuer of potential Nazi prisoners:  the beautiful yet dangerous Ludmilla Koslowski.  She has entered into a deal with the devil, for the Nazis are holding her outspoken journalist father prisoner, and promise to treat him well only if she spies for them, so they can catch the stranger who is saving so many from their clutches.  The sole glitch in this scheme is Ludmilla finds what her intended prey is doing to thwart the Nazis heroic and admirable, and she realizes upon meeting Horatio Smith that he must be the man she's after.  The Nazi general and his staff sneer at her choice, refusing to believe her, then finally come around and try to force her to entrap the professor.  How it all concludes is a tribute to Smith's ingenuity and almost suicidal courage as he faces down the enemies of the free world.

Pimpernel Smith is a close copy of its older cousin The Scarlet Pimprnel, but with a few important differences.  First, the setting of World War II and the Nazis as the main antangonists were near and dear to Leslie Howard's heart.  This movie is evidently a labor of his love; he is writer, director, producer and star, and no doubt hand-picked his cast.  Second, this is a simpler film, not lavishly produced like The Scarlet Pimpernel, and so has a less dated flavor.  And third, Smith's enemies are not so much people as an ideology, the twisted and contemptible ideology that destroyed so many lives and brought so much terror to Europe during Hitler's reign of madness.  Finally, the acting shines with almost startling brilliance.  Mary Morris as the lovely Ludmilla sizzles onscreen, and though she and Howard exchange only a brief kiss, their passion is almost tangible.  All of the other actors do an excellent job on their roles, whether serious, villainous or humorous.  As a piece of propaganda used for good, Pimpernel Smith is an invaluable contribution to cinema.  Try to see it, poor print quality and all, and it will treat the viewer to a glimpse into a dark past when brave people tried to keep the flame of liberty from being quenched by tyranny.",1120608000,19,3712,4.8354430379746836
903642,5,6304628153,"We're used to thinking of ""personal films"" as something modern; this one is sixty years old, and it's very personal. In 1939, fresh from  Gone with the Wind, LH could have done anything he wanted -- but Hitler was  bombing his country, and he went home to fight the war. It's safe to say he  had the final word on the screenplay: an update of one of his most famous  characters, the Scarlet Pimpernel. He is now smuggling intellectuals out of  Germany, under cover of being an archeology professor too absent-minded to  be taken seriously. Except, of course by Francis Sullivan of the Gestapo,  and Mary Morris (daughter of a freedom-fighting publisher). Howard the  Director keeps the tone light, the pace swift and the dialogue delightful.  You may not even notice the absence of violence...but you will remember his  final speech.  It's almost the last film he made. Howard went into acting  in the first place because he was shell-shocked in the first world war, and  acting was therapy. By the time this film was made, acting was a cover;  because he was also gathering intelligence for England when his plane was  shot down. This film was made in 1940, before a great deal was known about  how virulent the nazis were. It was a fusillade from a man who hated  war...This gentle Englishman, with a great gift for comedy, knew what was  important. In the place of the trademark pimpernel, there is a quote:  ""The mind of man is bounded only by the universe.""  See it.",966384000,53,1471,4.6498054474708175
903643,4,6304628153,"Sink me!  This is a deucedly entertaining play on the 1934 original.  A heroic archeologist battling Nazis?  Sounds vaguely familiar - I can't help but wonder whether George Lucas may have seen this film as a child.  This  is a wonderful, heartfelt wartime propaganda film.
Howard strikes just  the right light note as the English academic whose true calling is the  rescue of politically oppressed individuals.  Howard, that most English of  actors, was (believe it or not) Hungarian by birth, and he delivers a  stirring tribute to the values of his adopted homeland, Britain.  Francis  L. Sullivan (best known as Lawyer Jaggers in both the 1934 and 1945  versions of GREAT EXPECTATIONS) obviously had a great time playing this  update's counterpart to the original's Chauvelin.  Look for early  appearances by Michael Rennie (Klaatu in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL) and  David Tomlinson (Mr. Banks in MARY POPPINS).
Short of a major digital  restoration, this is probably the best quality copy you will find of this  film, which is a nearly sixty-year-old independent production.  The master  material is old, but it has been carefully cleaned and duplicated. I do  wish that the soundtrack had been duplicated in Hi-Fi, but that is a minor  quibble.",946512000,28,1254,5.03921568627451
903644,5,6304628153,"I first saw mention of ""Pimpernel Smith"" when I was reading about Raoul Wallenberg, the man who rescued tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews during the Holocaust. Apparently Wallenberg saw this movie a few years  before he undertook his mission, and was deeply moved by it. Judge for  yourself if it is reasonable to think that this philosophical fairy-tale  inspired Wallenberg's exceptional heroism and strength of spirit. When I  saw it, I did get the idealistic impression that this might be the case.",919296000,15,504,5.036144578313253

903779,5,6304628153,"This is the only sequel to place the central figure, Prof. Horatio Smith(Leslie Howard), (Scarlet Pimpernel re-incarnate) a century and then some years in the future. Yet, knowing this, this meticulously restored yarn stands entirely alone in thought-provoking suspense, cat-and-mouse deception and thought. Cambridge Prof. Smith is traveling through Germany in wartime with a handful of students while a mysterious man rescues endangered scientists, intellectuals. Are they connected and how? The way Leslie Howard embodies this earlier Indiana Jones archaeologist so completely with all the thrills of his original Scarlet Pimpernel (disguises/surprises) yet takes on fully the seriousness of the Nazi threat to humanity with witty and thought-provoking dialogue places this above most WWII yarns. Added to the Gestapo pressures is an added tension of a cagey female (Mary Morris) pursuer seeking the identity of this war-time savior. The polished script by Leslie Howard is fantastically photographed making this a compelling lustrous addition to the WWII spy genre. A final monologue directed to the Gestapo is as valid today as it was in the 40s.",1481846400,3,1151,5.582857142857143

904050,3,6304628153,"I understand that, in 1941, the Nazis were waving their sabers at Great Britain.  Everybody was nervous, hoping without hope for some peaceful way of warding off the impending danger.  There was thus need to alert the world, not to terrify the world public into paralysis.  Thus Leslie Howard produced, directed and starred in an update of a film he had made a decade earlier THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, the update entitled PIMPERNEL SMITH.  While THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, based on a play and novel by Baroness Emmuska Orczy came out more than a less threatening century after its historical setting, The Reign of Terror, she could be more pointed in her depiction of its barbarism, terror and menace.  Because of the more current conditions of Howard's  PIMPERNEL SMITH, he had to push his story more in the direction of a kind of semi-light comedy about an archeology summer school trip to Germany while helping prisoners escape to freedom on the eve of World War II.  This film, by the way, was the inspiration for Raoul Wallenberg and what he did helping prisoners escape the Third Reich during the war.  What Professor Horatio Smith did while wearing the guise of a fumbling absent-minded professor paralleled what the fop Sir Percy Blakeney did for the  aristocrats escaping Robespierre and Madame Guillotine.  Both beautifully written, directed and acted.  Why then did the more modern version, though of this time, fail to attain the menace, the earlier version?  I think I have to point my finger at an actor I consider one of the truly great in modern theatre and film--Francis L. Sullivan.  In fact, I felt more menace from his parallel in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL--Raymond Massey.  I have seen Francis L. Sullivan be more menacing in other films.  Why not in this film, as General Von Graum?  It seemed to me that he evoked more fear from members of his staff who seemed more like Keystone Kops versions of the Gestapo.  :Perhaps I should fault the character he was given to play.  In fact, the only menace I got from PIMPERNEL SMITH was from Leslie Howard himself in his final scene when he so eloquently and clearly said to Francis, ""You are doomed.""  I had the eerie feeling some Nazi Intelligence officer had sneaked across the Channel  and written that scene for his side and the Allies' side.  Even on the eve of the war, many General officers were fully aware that Hitler was leading them down a very dangerous path.  Plus, with the excellent lighting on Howard's face, the use of shadows half covering his piercing eyes, it was the best scene of the film",1435449600,,2564,4.753393665158371

The acting is flawless and if one watches closely you will see future stars in early roles.  The plot's anti-Nazi message understated and is powerfully spot on done at a time many were yet to recognize the true horror of the Nazi movement and the chillingly accurate prediction of Hitler and Nazi future is not only uncanny but poignant in light of Mr. Howard's real life death at the hands of the Nazi terror in 1943.

To think that this was made so early in WWII is remarkable. Though at times the Allies' naivete of how evil the German plot was is glaring, for the most part it's a most prophetic movie. A keen awareness of just how diabolical the Nazi movement was and would soon become shines through, especially in the stirring speech by the main character at the end.

The mark of Leslie Howard is all over this film. Even prophetic to his own involvement in the war effort & his subsequent death.

Few movies can employ such intrigue, humor & social statement with such resounding emotional connection. This movie has it all. Watch it now!",1382140800,,674,4.694915254237288
904763,4,6304628153,"Given the important facts about the making of this film--that Leslie Howard, the original Scarlet Pimpernel in the Alexander Korda classic,has updated the story to Nazi Germany and stars as the befuddled professor/daring rescuer, and that Howard, not content just to make films to boost British morale, was also doing secret intelligence work for the British government and died on a mission for them, only a year after this movie came out--the film would have a special resonance anyway. I am probably prejudiced about it simply because THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL is my favorite adventure story of all time, so any version of it would interest me.

But I read about this film years ago and when it ran on some late-night L.A. station, I taped it and have watched it several times since. It's a genuinely good film (no, not a great one), and watching Howard, the quiet, understated hero, take on the Nazis both physically and then verbally (in the wonderfully funny scene where the professor goes to a party at the embassy) is just wonderful. It's ironic that Howard was best loved for SCARLET PIMPERNEL, the hero who didn't look like a hero, yet is best known for having played Ashley Wilkes in GONE WITH THE WIND, a part that was difficult for anyone because he was supposed to LOOK like a hero but was not. (And it might not have been much fun for Howard to have been completely overshadowed by Clark Gable, in his own greatest role.)

One small point here: another reviewer said Howard took the role in GWTW in order to finance these propaganda films, but that's not accurate. He took the role because David Selznick promised he could be associate producer for another film, INTERMEZZO (with Ingrid Bergman), which was something Howard was anxious to do. Howard was the only one of the 4 stars of GWTW who did not appear at the Atlanta premiere; he had already returned to England to help with the war effort there.

As I remember the film, there were some wonderful scenes (esp. of Howard as the professor) interspersed with some that were a little overlong and slightly boring. The overall effect was a film I was glad I'd seen, and one I know I'll see again. But it does not have the narrative drive of the original story, though I remember liking very much the scenes where the students began to figure out just what kind of man was leading them on their archaeological dig.

I think anyone who like me loved THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL would enjoy it, with the extra knowledge that the man who made it was serving his country like the Pimpernel, with genuine fervor and courage. We will always need more like him.",1380326400,,2611,4.657266811279826

904869,5,6304628153,"Long before Indiana Jones, there was another dashing archaelogy professor who tussled with the Nazis. PIMPERNEL SMITH, released in 1941 and alternately titled MISTER V, is an updating of THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, with the backdrop of the French Revolution being swapped for that of pre-World War II Europe.

Berlin, during the spring of 1939, and rumors rage up and down the Third Reich, of an uncatchable mystery man who boldly rescues eminent artists and intellectuals from Gestapo persecution and concentration camps. This, even as the German propaganda machine engages in blustery denials. Meanwhile, Horatio Smith, prim and forgetful English professor of archaelogy, undertakes a seemingly innocuous tour of Germany with six of his students. Except that their first few stops coincide with daring prison break-outs which were effected near their vicinity. However, it takes the professor garnering a bloody wound before his students finally catch a clue...

Now introduce a beautiful girl who works with the Gestapo against her will, and the tense cat-and-mouse games really begin.

Leslie Howard, in all the films I've seen him in, has never been less than very, very good (The Scarlet Pimpernel, Pygmalion - Criterion Collection, The Petrified Forest, Stand-In). PIMPERNEL SMITH, a movie Howard himself produced and directed, provides a grand and showy platform for his wonderful talents. His Professor Smith is very British and stiff upper lipped, but with a dose of unexpectedly sneaky humor. This movie meant a lot to Leslie Howard. A fervent advocate of the British war effort, he reportedly signed on for Gone with the Wind (Four-Disc Collector's Edition) 1939 so as to finance a personal propaganda project like PIMPERNEL SMITH, which, like IDIOT'S DELIGHT and Hitchcock's classic Foreign Correspondent, strived to warn the world about the ever-encroaching threat of Nazi Germany.

It helps a lot, of course, that the movie also serves as a taut and rousing adventure thriller, with plenty of sequences in which the unassuming, cerebral hero outwits his enemies silly. As his impulsive American student admiringly tells him: ""I guess you're one of the goodest guys in Creation."" But PIMPERNEL SMITH is also graced with many sly moments of Professor Smith tweaking the nose of his German foil, the cunning and bombastic General von Graum, who is this film's version of Citizen Chauvelin. The imposingly corpulent Francis Sullivan is terrific, lending a jaded flair to his von Graum, who makes it his mission to nab the very clever professor. Sullivan's battles of wit with Howard provide some of the film's best moments. Mary Morris is also quite good as the lovely and reluctant Nazi agent, Ludmilla Koslowski, who manages to ensnare the Professor's misogynistic heart.

Mood and lighting enhance the film. The film-noirish cinematography makes excellent use of light and shadow, two wonderful examples of which are when Professor Smith is revealed to his students to be the daring man of action and also near the end as Smith, in brooding shadow except for his gleaming eyes, defiantly condemns the German war machine to von Graum's sweaty face. The film looks very atmospheric, yet is enlivened by occasional moments of humor (Shakespeare apparently was German!). By the way, I totally dug the scarecrow scene (and, really, Howard should've expanded on that sequence quite a bit more; you'll see what I mean). I'm not much of an expert, but I can't help but feel that Leslie Howard was well on his way to becoming a director of some note.

Except he wasn't with us for very long. He was 50 years old when, in 1943, his plane was shot down by German combat aircrafts. Some say, shot down purposely, with German Intelligence having knowledge of Leslie Howard, an indefatigable contributor to the British war propaganda, being onboard. If that holds even a germ of truth, it adds that much more resonance to this film. It bugs me a bit that Howard is probably best known mostly for his role in GONE WITH THE WIND, because he's done so much more than that. In my eyes, the man has left an indelible mark in cinema. I thought he was simply fabulous in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL and PYGMALION. But, even beyond that, his accomplishments in real life, for his people and his country, rank him as a patriot of the stiffest upper lip. Leslie Howard really is one of the goodest guys in Creation.",1374883200,2,4394,5.037138927097661
904870,5,6304628153,Witty. Moralistic. Ethical. Captivating and suspenseful. What a movie should be. I didn't know Leslie Howard went on to direct. I give him credit but also A.G. Macdonnell for the original story. The predictions and loathing of Nazi behavior was given before WWII even ended. A true battle of good vs. evil and this film espouses that with some hope. Worth watching twice. My only disagreement is with the Pimpernel's - as the professor - misapplication of Titus 1:15: To the pure all things are pure. It is taken out of context.,1368748800,,528,4.75

Very pricey in DVD format, but there it was - on Kindle. Don't forget to enjoy Kindle!

904873,4,6304628153,"I think I watched this one nine times in a row when I first discovered it.  I'm kinda picky what movies I own, but this would be a welcome addition to my dvd collection!  Now the real review:
To betray or not to betray? is just one question that plagues Lusinda Koslovski. Whom to betray? is another. Should she betray her beloved father, imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp? Or should she betray the imaginary Rescuer, a phantom who appears from nowhere and dissolves back into it at will? Only General von Graum seems convinced that he exists. Having made her deal with the Nazis, Lusinda manufactures her own, third option, after discovering the identity of the Rescuer - enlist his help in her fathers escape. Impressed first by her skill in identifying him, then by her courage and strength, the Rescuer quietly falls in love with her. How could she help but return his affection? An excellent film with clever verbal fencing and good acting, I would still caution the parents. A nude female statue (Aphrodite) is given considerable screen time; and a wall-size painting featuring approximately three nude women in various poses is also pictured. None of it is necessary to the plot, simply salted in as if it didn't matter. I say it isn't necessary because, despite the Professor's preoccupation with Aphrodite, the statue itself needn't have been included.",1352505600,,1367,4.887931034482759
904874,4,6304628153,"An entertaining movie, with enjoyable English humor.
""What are you up to, old chap?""
""Absolutely nothing.""
""Well don't let it get the better of you.""
Unfortunately the Nazis were all properly English rather than sadistic Germans & spoke proper English too, including Leslie Howard (whom I was introduced toas as a boy in ""Pygmalion"" & have adnired & respected ever since). Howard, as ""Herr Bodenschatz"" brazenly went into the German HQ & he too was clearly identifiable as himself - using Howard mannerisms in playing his undercover role. But the movie, though quite long, was as I said at the outset was entertaining & well worth viewing..",1348272000,,640,4.990654205607477
904875,5,6304628153,"""Pimpernel Smith"" starring Leslie Howard is a wonderful updating of the orginal ""Scarlet Pimpernel"" story, with Mr. Howard reprising his role as ""The Pimpernel"".

Again playing a British Aristocrat [this time in the garb of a Cambridge Academic], Mr. Howard deftly outwits his Nazi foes as he did previously against the evil forces who took over the French Revolution.

If you have never seen ""Pimpernel Smith"" find a copy. If you've never seen the original ""Scarlet Pimpernel"" find a copy and watch it first.

A great old fashion set of ""heroic"" adventures.",1344902400,,558,5.043478260869565

904878,5,6304628153,"Pimpernel Smith is one of Leslie Howards last films before his untimely death during WWII. Howard was reaching his prime as an actor, a director and a producer. This film, in which Howard is the star as well as director and producer, is a delight to watch, creating suspense and a slow build to excitement. It is not an ""in your face"" film, but rather a slower moving but cleverly written indictment against the Nazis who, by this time, had been bombing England for over a year.
Clever writing, wonderful acting and a story line that has great moments of subtlety remind one how endearing Leslie Howard was to the film world and those who enjoyed his work.
It is a shame a DVD has not been struck of this film. It would fit nicely onto a shelf of films with other favorites.
Enjoy what is available.",1227398400,3,799,4.442176870748299
