4650996,5,B005BYWM2E,This video demonstrates how ballet should be taught to beginning dancers in order to lay down a foundation to build on as they progress!,1350000000,2,136,4.708333333333333
4650997,2,B005BYWM2E,"This video is like an actual ballet class.  I bought it to do with my 4 year old, however it is recommended for ages 5-7.  I would stick with the age recommendation, because we didn't even get through it once.  My daughter was bored and wanted to turn it off.  If you have a child who LOVES dance, and is interested in learning technique, without much dancing, then you may be pleased with this purchase.  However, it didn't work for us.",1349740800,2,437,4.345679012345679
4650998,4,B005BYWM2E,Well presented with good tips and reminders for things you might have forgotten when teaching very young students. Have incorporated some of Miss Stabrova's ideas already and the children tell me they can remember them very easily. Many thanks.,1344211200,,244,5.282051282051282

4651000,5,B005BYWM2E,"Before having my children I studied and taught ballet.  Now that my children are getting older I wanted to start teaching them but they have no desire to learn from Mommy and all the teacher in our area have been a BIG disappointment!!!  But this video is amazing.  My daughters will actually follow along and I can be hands on and help them get it right.  Thank you, Thank you!!!!  Finally a beginning ballet class on dvd that is not fluff.  I hope she films more classes because I will buy them all!!!",1317168000,10,503,4.354838709677419
4651001,5,B005BYWM2E,The children are exeptional.  She is delightful in the way that she presents her program.  I hope there are more of her classes comming soon.,1313280000,2,141,4.6
8464656,5,B005BYWM2E,"Inna is an exceptional teacher. Her methods are thorough, safe and highly effective. I strongly recommend this and any of her instructional DVD'S!",1488412800,,146,5.391304347826087
8464657,5,B005BYWM2E,"I needed some new ideas for this age group, and this DVD filled the bill.",1429488000,2,73,3.933333333333333
8464658,5,B005BYWM2E,"My video arrived on time and in excellent condition. I am a former dancer with two young daughters in their first year of dance classes. They are attending a ballet school, but I also love to dance with them at home. This video offers a great balance to the more free form dancing that most dance schools teach to their youngest dancers in the United States. I also love ballet traditions and history and this video also provides a wonderful opportunity to begin introducing the incomparably rich history of Russian ballet and theater.",1429056000,2,535,4.763440860215054
8464659,5,B005BYWM2E,This is a fabulous DVD! Inna Stabrova is a genius and I adore her.  She loves ballet and is happy to share her teaching skills with the world.  What a tremendous artist.  I can't recommend this DVD highly enough,1390262400,,211,4.358974358974359
8464660,5,B005BYWM2E,"I purchased this video about 3 months ago and have been regularly integrating Inna's exercises in my classes with excellent results. Inna's exercises are very age-appropriate and will help build a strong foundation for young dancers. The explanations of exercises are very thorough with great pointers on what to look for when working with young dancers to help them perform them correctly and improve. I like this one so much I am buy her others!

8464661,5,B005BYWM2E,Inna Stabrova is one of the best teachers out there!!! A great way for the little ones to build strength and keep their attention while doing challenging exercises. I highly recommend buying this for your studio or dancer for a strong foundation so you can see results!!,1379376000,,270,4.76595744680851
8464662,5,B005BYWM2E,"Inna Stabrova has shown some very solid excercises for children, and was also able to present them in a very charming yet competent way. I had to laugh as the one little girl almost fell asleep standing at the barre.",1367452800,,216,4.425
8464663,4,B005BYWM2E,"I am not reviewing content here...but possibly quality.  I love the idea still, and want to be able to use it with my daughters.  This dvd does not play on my oldish dvd player.  It reads as a DVD-R and will not play.  Just wanted to put the warning out there so there isn't a sad surprise awaiting someone else.",1356652800,4,312,4.15
8464664,5,B005BYWM2E,"I highly recommend this wonderful video by Inna Stabrova.  This is indeed the way to start off very young bodies on the path to true Classical Ballet training!  It is not ""Beginning"" as in the First Years Work  (Beginning Syllabus) of the Vaganova Method, but it is *exactly* what must come before this.  The floor exercise section will be a real eye opener for those who think that lower back strength is ""just"" produced by barre-work!  Her exercises, demonstrated by three adorable pre-ballet children, are how every Lesson at this level should begin.  If you teach these exercises correctly and on a regular basis to your young students their lower backs, deep abdominals and lateral muscles (not to mention their feet and legs) will be well prepared for their first year of Classical training.
Thank you Inna for presenting us with some of the true ""missing pieces"" of the very beginnings! I hope that in the future you will strongly consider creating a video of the entire floor exercise series which the Bolshoi School teaches to their first year students...we need this!
BTW...Amazon is saying that this DVD is currently unavailable but you can still get it if you go to YouTube; her email addy is at the end of the video demonstration of this DVD.",1351987200,8,1255,4.787037037037037
8464665,4,B005BYWM2E,Lovely video for beginning ballet. Professional approach but at the same time fun for the kids (i.e. 'jump over the flower') Very good explanations and comments.,1350086400,2,161,5.230769230769231
