The three movies are old and beat up kind of B quality, and C in some parts of it, but it is watchable. And for the price, it should be less after I noticed that these movies been remastered with much better picture, and sound, and their prices are less than what Amazon offer. My advice to any buyer: shop around first before you order.",1376956800,,457,4.204545454545454
8447755,3,B004XZ99NW,"I know the old adage ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" I have now learned that one should not judge a sex psychedelia dvd collection by its cover either. To be honest, I bought this, not because of the busty hippie woman on the cover, but because of the *adorable* spaceman who looks so menacing yet fun! Howevs, ""It Came From Love"" only featured about 5 seconds of the spaceman who looked nothing like the one on the cover. He looked like a dude in a mask he bought at Woolworth's at a post-Halloween clearance. Other than that it was just a bunch of hippies boning.

Still, it was pretty good and the spaceman's voice was hilarious as he led the various hippies through various Kama Sutra poses! He was one spaceman *not* easily satiated. Also, *loved* the tinfoil set. Might have been better on acid.

What else can I say? Inspired but disappointed.",1313971200,5,853,4.496774193548387
