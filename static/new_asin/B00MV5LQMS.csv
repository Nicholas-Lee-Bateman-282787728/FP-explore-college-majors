The entire action of Dmitri Tcherniakov's Brussels production takes place in the living room of a turn-of-the-century house. Only five characters are onstage -- Leonora, Azucena, Manrico, di Luna, and Ferrando -- all in modern dress, and all present in every scene. All the minor roles and some of the chorus entrances are also sung by one of these principals; the main body of the chorus is invisible, which gives an odd effect when the soloists must sing with it.

Tcherniakov's concept is based on two observations. One, that most of the action in Verdi's opera takes place before the curtain rises, and much of it is devoted to accounts of something that took place in the past. Two, that this story of mistaken identities, revenge, and madness is notoriously difficult to follow, and even the characters themselves do not always know who everyone is. So why not extend this, and set the production even further from the events, and make the whole thing a memory play? So Azucena summons all the original participants to this locked room, and has them revisit all the old situations, with the aim of facing up to their own roles in the tragedy. It works, after a fashion, in the early stages, and it is certainly a pleasure to see an example of Konzeptregie that is not mere Eurotrash, but a sober attempt to approach an old warhorse in a new and thoughtful way. But -- leaving aside the difficulty of imagining a sequel to an opera in which three of the five characters end up dead -- it is bizarre to see a Trovatore that throws out almost all the qualities that make it the perennial favorite that it is.

Except for that glorious unabashedly operatic music, which in the best moments blazes out as fine as ever, given the conducting by Marc Minkowski which is lithe and convincing throughout. Tcherniakov should be pleased with his cast of singers, who give him all he wants dramatically and more, though sometimes at the expense of sheer vocalism. The finest is Marina Poplavskaya as Leonora; though she seems uncharacteristically dark at the start, she gives an ethereal Act IV aria -- all with her back to the audience! Misha Didyk as Manrico is young, blond, and handsome, and pretty good vocally too, though omitting that traditional high C. Sylvia Brunet-Grupposo likewise looks perfect as a much more put-together Azucena than usual, and sings very well at medium dynamics, though she gets ugly when she shouts. Scott Hendricks is a far, far better singer as di Luna than his general overacting might indicate, and indeed many of the production's most exciting musical moments come when he is singing with one of the others. Ferrando is much the smallest role, but Giovanni Furlanetto fills it marvelously as a seedy old geezer in a raincoat.

So not a Trovatore for beginners, or indeed the first in anyone's collection. But hey, the price of a DVD is much less than an opera ticket, and even if you only watch it once, it will challenge your assumptions about how opera works. Give it a try.",1483315200,2,3198,4.717352415026833
