7802926,2,6300149129,"OK, so I had a yearning for a ""women in prison"" flick.  I admit it.  I bought this video for very little money.  It was worth about what I paid.  The movie tracks a group of female inmates after they escape from a European prison.  If you are looking for a film that empowers women (as I was) you are going to be disappointed. The competence of the combined group of women is superseded by one man who constantly finds himself in the position to bail them out.  There is also a random nun who travels with the group.  We never really learn her motivation to follow them (she also never loses her gown or habit- this ommission is a significant drawback). As one might expect, there is very little character development.  This alone, would not sound the death knell for this movie.  However, there are so many developments that simply don't make sense.  People who are trying to kill each other in one scene form unlikely alliances in the next.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme nor reason to these plot twists beyond the lack of ideas of this movie's director/writer.  And to top it all off, it isn't racy enough to have that B-movie skin appeal that I was hoping would redeem it.  It was also dubbed (poorly).  I gave it two stars for the beauty of some of its locales.  They did provide some diversion.",1024358400,2,1305,4.401673640167364
