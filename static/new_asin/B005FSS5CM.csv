8470641,4,B005FSS5CM,Great interviews and I enjoyed hearing some of the inside scoop on the games.  Overall it was informative and enjoyable.,1392249600,,120,5.0
8470642,5,B005FSS5CM,"I've been a fan of COTV since Rob was skinny, so I had to buy this to add to my collection of video game documentaries. Rob & Hailey go to all the cool insider events in the gaming industry, so watching this makes me feel cool. I hope they re-release all their DVDs on Blu-ray at some anniversary point and maybe it will come with a cool retro gaming toy or something. My parents think I have too many toys anyways, so that may not be a good idea. I should move out already. I'm 40.",1313798400,,482,4.03125
8470643,5,B005FSS5CM,"Another addition to the COIN-OP TV DVD series. I have all the other three DVDs and am glad to see the team came out with another. This may just be the best one yet! The interviews, as always, are fun and entertaining, but this time there's audio commentary for every episode! One of my favorite features of DVD is wonderfully exploited here. The behind-the-scenes trivia and factoids just add to and already great value!",1313452800,,420,4.6891891891891895
8470644,5,B005FSS5CM,"I was a big fan of Coin-Op TV Volume 3, and this one continues the tradition of quality programming about the video game culture.  Great highlights of video games and past events, but definitely the best feature of this DVD is the audio commentary from Robert Welkner and Hailey Bright. It's only on the DVD, so you gotta get it for that alone. Good stuff, look forward to Volumer 5 and more commentary.",1313452800,3,403,4.52054794520548
