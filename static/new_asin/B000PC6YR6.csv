8190503,5,B000PC6YR6,"Jay Perez shows off his vocal chords with great music that he has recorded for himself as well as other songs by other well-known artists.  He is able to capture the ""soul"" of Tejano music, which involves both English and Spanish.  --Don't expect Jay to win any ""most handsome"" contests...but I can say, without a doubt...Jay has charm...&...""The Dude Can Sing!""",1303084800,,362,4.918032786885246
8190504,3,B000PC6YR6,"This DVD is very basic, nothing spectacular, could have been in the bargain bin at my Walmart if I was lucky - but instead I paid a little more than I wanted to.  It has some good 'older' hits that he's had, but I personally didn't like the fact that he threw some R&B in there....I pay to see Jay Perez play what made him famous....and that's TEJANO.  Don't get me wrong, I like the songs that he sang - in their original format, by the original artists not by him.  He's a very talented singer, it's just when I think Jay Perez I think Tejano.  Just goes to show you that Jay Perez' biggest fan is....Jay Perez!",1297296000,,613,4.169491525423729
