5087889,5,B007I1Q4D6,"I'm taking a group of MBA students to Israel this spring and wanted to learn more about the country.  One of our students suggested this DVD.  I am so glad that he did.  This is a very touching look at Israel.  A very personal and very moving discussion of what Israel means to a very accomplished man.  After watching this DVD twice, I can't wait to see Israel in person.",1358812800,,372,4.257142857142857
5087890,1,B007I1Q4D6,"Don't look for actual documentary information in this video.  Produced by JerusalemOnlineU.com, a diploma mill exposed by Forward magazine ([...])and directed by South African Wayne Kopping, who also did such objective ""documentaries"" as Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West; Crossing the Line: The Intifada Comes to Campus; and The Third Jihad.

This video is Israeli hasbara (propaganda).  A 55-min. infomercial.  Avoid.",1357776000,2,433,5.935483870967742
5087891,5,B007I1Q4D6,"My husband and I truly enjoyed this,  So much so that we have purchased more as gifts.  A very insightful and wonderful program on the beautiful land and people of Israel.  Much appreciated!",1354147200,,190,4.696969696969697
5087892,5,B007I1Q4D6,"A brilliant DVD filled with numerous examples of how positive attitudes & energy will always succeed over adversity. Professor Tal Ben-Shachar not only taught at Harvard for many years, but he taught the class that is documented as the most popular class at Harvard!  This DVD is a must-see for anyone faced with adversity, who may need a positive push in the right direction. Forget that Israel is the example country used here, this dvd could be about any ""rise above conflict"" situation.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Israel-Inside/dp/B007I1Q4D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Israel Inside</a>",1344297600,5,632,6.264367816091954
5087893,5,B007I1Q4D6,"This documentary is narrated by Dr. Tal Ben Shahar, who was born and raised in Israel, and received a Ph. D. from Harvard University, where he taught a popular course on ""positive psychology.""  He now lives in Israel.

Israel is the world leader in technological innovation per capita.  It is located on an arid desert and has virtually no natural resources.  Notwithstanding this, it is a leading exporter of fresh fruit and vegetables which are grown using an innovative system of drip irrigation.  Also, outside of Silicone Valley, there are more technology start up firms in Israel than in anywhere else in the world.  Many US technology firms, including Microsoft and Google, have a major presence in Israel.

Ben Shahar examines these and other accomplishments and gives his perspective on how a small country achieved such a high level of technological sophistication.  His answer lies in a list of six ""actualizers"" that he believes have enabled this achievement on a national level - family, converting adversity to advantage, chuptzah (or not taking ""no"" for an answer), education, taking action, and tikkun olam (or repairing the world.)

The film is not judgmental in the sense that it just focuses on what Israel does to achieve these accomplishments and does not seek to draw comparisons with neighboring countries or attempt to explain why Israel, for example, has achieved something that its Arab neighbors have not.  In fact, one of the few mentions of an Arab neighbor is in the description of Israel's ""Save a Child's Heart"" program where more than half of the open heart surgeries performed are provided free of charge to Palestinian children.

This film is engrossing and moves along at a fast pace.  Much of the information provided is developed through interviews with Israelis and others.  It provides a fascinating insight into what some consider a modern day miracle - the transformation of a desert into the homeland of a world leader for technological innovation.",1337644800,14,1991,5.070552147239264
5087894,2,B007I1Q4D6,"The ""movie"" is a simple piece of paid by Israeli institutions PR advertisement that has the chutzpa to let you pay for seeing it instead of paying you for. This is part of a concentrated Israeli campaign to counter the world public opinion and the majority Diaspora Jewish view on Israel and its anti-democratic development.
It's really a fine piece of trash.",1337126400,,359,4.806451612903226
5087895,5,B007I1Q4D6,"I saw the movie recently at a preview at a Jewish Community Center.  It is the best produced advertisement for Israel that I have ever seen.  The only thing better is to actually visit Israel.  If you already think you understand the people, the advanced technology, the motivation, the chutzpah, etc. you will find out that you still have a lot to learn.  The story is told by real people.  View it, buy it.",1337040000,4,408,4.45945945945946

8517197,5,B007I1Q4D6,"This was surprising information to me about normal, everyday life in the state of Israel.  I always wondered how they not only survive psychologically but thrive with the constant threat they live under.  Very concise and well organized.  Good advice for young people who face problems (also, for American adults who believe they have it bad in the USA).",1369699200,,354,4.966101694915254
