533717,3,6302989744,It is basically a silly Sonja Henie movie plot but the skating is first rate if you can get past the sappy plot and how callow Tyrone Power looked when he was just starting out.,1385164800,,177,4.085714285714285
533718,4,6302989744,"Yes, it's marketed as a Sonja Henie picture but, in truth, the real marketing angle would be to sell it with other Tyrone Power films that have yet to make it to DVD - there's the audience! Fox has released 2 Tyrone Power box sets in recent years yet there are still many of his films that are not even on VHS, let alone DVD (I'm thinking of Suez, American Guerilla in the Phillipines and the non-Fox film Mississippi Gambler). A box set with this film and the other Sonja Henie vehicle, Second Fiddle, would be great. We Tyrone Power fans would snap them up.",1294790400,4,559,4.333333333333333
533719,5,6302989744,"After One in a Million 1936, Sonja Henie was fast becoming a Hollywood star in the front rank. In THIN ICE she is teamed with her then-boyfriend Tyrone Power and the chemistry is explosive... It`s a Cinderella-story, but given the full treatment by 20th Century-Fox - it`s almost like an MGM extravaganza :-)
The skating is good and Joan Davis as a comedy relief is a winner. As a matter of fact I can`t understand the fuzz they make about the Astaire&Rogers musicals over at RKO... I much more prefer the Sonja Henie`s at 20th Century-Fox... They are never OVERLONG and never outstays their welcome:-)
The affair with Power never ended in marriage; he was bisexual and Sonja found out... When he married French Annabella she was reportedly deeply hurt though they remained friends up until Power died of a heart-attack while filming in 1958.",1089676800,9,842,4.813793103448276

533840,3,6302989744,"This is a fairly enjoyable little comedy interlaced with skating routines by Henie and some comedy numbers by Joan Davis.  By today's standards Henie's skating is not horribly impressive, but the fact that simple entertainment like this film or those by Esther Williams a decade or so later show how much more simple and innocent the movie going public was.  I mean that in the best possible way and you wonder when you see the mass popularity of Olympic skating and G rated films, whether Hollywood is missing the boat and maybe we've changed less as a whole and just Hollywood doesn't get it.  Back during the studio system it seems that what made money dictated the decisions of filmmakers.  Now it seems more garbage is churned out without any thought if there is even an audience for it.",1410912000,2,792,4.676258992805756
533841,5,6302989744,Bought this as a Christmas present for my mother.  When she was growing up she loved Tyrone Power!  She loved the movie.,1409184000,,120,4.409090909090909
533842,5,6302989744,"A delightful film with Sonja Henie, but it's Tyrone Power that steals the show. He plays a Prince who rather go snow skiing, He leaves the main hotel and relocates to a nearby ski resort where he meets Sonja on the snow, Sonja has no idea who he is, AND HE gives a another name, and before you know it they land up falling in love. Great skating numbers highlight this film, I consider it her 3rd best film.  It's a pleasure and Sun Valley Serenade are the other two above it. It's worth getting.",1407196800,,496,4.221052631578948
533843,1,6302989744,"A curious amalgam of Tyrone Power and Sonja Henie, who become secondary to the lavishly appointed ice skating ballets. Crummy B&W transfer, with lots of edge effects, video noise and age-related artifacts. Pass.",1405641600,,211,5.424242424242424

533845,4,6302989744,"Not a five star, but definitely a 4, if you like ice skating you'll like this one. I really wish they would put more of her movies on DVD so we would have a greater selection to choose from.",1398816000,,190,3.8974358974358974

7834236,5,6302989744,"This fine movie is from way back, but it is sure to thrill the hearts of many.  With all the figure skating that Sonja Henie does it reads like an ice extravaganza.  Sipping that hot coffee up on the slopes together makes for a warm and toasty feeling doesn't it?  Tyrone is a prince, but Sonja doesn't know he is when he courts her.  Fun stuff.  Like taking a trip back in time, and thankfully so, considering all the new junk movies.",1513987200,,435,4.2560975609756095

7834241,4,6302989744,"A prince visits a Swiss resort and (under an assumed name) falls in love with the skating instructor. Incredible skating performances by Sonja Henie with scores of backup skaters and accompanied by a full orchestra and chorus. Breathtaking. Thin plot with musical numbers, dancing and skating featured. Henie tops the charts for cuteness, and she actually give a credible performance as an actress. If you like musicals from this period, you will like this moviea pleasurable, artistic experience.",1482796800,,497,5.384615384615385
