The special effects are very well done and did I mention it's gory as hell too. It's a great short horror movie that everyone should watch. Keep up the good work guys, I look forward to your future films. Doug Godino if you read this, your makeup and masks are amazing! Keep up the gory good work guys!

I love this freaky little flick as I try not to be biased as I know one of the kids personally. Excellent job from these teens. The gore effects at the end were quite believable.  I've watched House of Wrathiticus in pieces before, (no pun intended) but to see it whole on DVD is a riot. I laughed out loud at some of the scenes and yet still had to turn my head away from the gore scenes at the end.  (Did I mention that I all ready seen these gore scenes before?) The effects are really that well done. The movie is just under 30 minutes so there really isn't any drag. Some profanity but not excessive.  Douglas Godino proves to be as talented with his special effects as well as with his acting.  BTW Remember that name folks. ;-)

Lastly, IMHO, it has more substance than Blair Witch Project and there's nobody's nostrils you are forced to look up or dizziness due to shaky camera effect. Can't wait to see what they will come up with next!!!",1297123200,3,1186,4.267857142857143
