2656217,3,B000IHYRYA,"My son loves this series,too bad it is no longer made, which explains the outrageous price.
Otherwise it is a good DVD and kids will enjoy it!",1242950400,,142,4.296296296296297
2656218,5,B000IHYRYA,"My 2 yr. old grandson adores this video and as a teacher, I like it, also. He watches it every time he comes over and knows all the names of the different machines.  It shows the different ""diggers"" up close and doing their jobs.  There is good explanation of what they are doing, and the spelling and letters make this a learning experience, also. Much better than some I have purchased,",1182816000,,388,4.450704225352113
2656219,5,B000IHYRYA,"I have both all three monster truck, because it was so fun to watch.",1173312000,,68,3.9285714285714284
2656220,5,B000IHYRYA,"My 15-month-old son is in LOVE with the Totally Trucks series! He loves watching the footage of the machinery and actually dances to the score. He likes when the kids shout greetings to the machines (usually this makes him clap and giggle).

I love the fact that the educational elements are presented within a fun context like ""can you find"" games. The repetition of the concepts is really helping him learn, too.

My son is eating up these 3 DVDs. Please make more!",1168819200,4,467,4.614457831325301
2656221,2,B000IHYRYA,"My 3 year old loves tractors, so he could watch this DVD all day. There is no way I could though! The music does not go with the movie at all. And I hate to say it, but if you were just listening, and not watching, you would think it was an adult film. Yeah, I know! The trucks are great, I just wish it had ""truck"" kind of music to go along with it!",1168473600,5,350,3.68
2656222,3,B000IHYRYA,"This video is fairly entertaining.  The real movie reviewers are my boys (ages 2,3 & 6).  They will watch parts of this DVD but not be totally taken with it throughout the show.  There are other big machine videos out there they like better (I Love Big Machines I & II and the Hard Hat Harry construction video).  I'm not sure why this does not keep their attention as much as other videos but the quality of the camera work is not too bad and the voice overs are not irritating.",1167868800,3,479,4.230769230769231
2656223,5,B000IHYRYA,Wow.  What a terrific idea.  Thanks for keeping my son entertained with all these fantastic trucks!  Let's see some more.  Keep up the great work!,1161734400,,146,4.72
2656224,5,B000IHYRYA,"We got all three dvds in this series for our nephew (2) because, like a lot of boys around his age, he seems obsessed with large industrial vehicles.  He watched these dvds in something like a trance.  There are educational elements cleverly slipped into the action, but mostly it's trucks doing all kinds of cool, trucky things I didn't even know about.",1158883200,4,354,4.693548387096774
2656225,5,B000IHYRYA,"It's such a simple yet brilliant concept. Just give little boys what they want...TRUCKS. Real trucks, big trucks, every kind of truck and machine you can think of. The footage is put together in a fast and fun format that grabs their attention and holds it. My son loved the videos and keeps coming back for repeat viewings. You owe it to yourself to try them.",1158537600,4,360,4.46969696969697
8145448,5,B000IHYRYA,Great for any dirt and truck junkie :),1473552000,,38,3.875
8145449,1,B000IHYRYA,Horrible just plain horrible kids and parents will agree this video sucks.,1432857600,,74,5.25
8145450,1,B000IHYRYA,This item is not worth the price.,1426291200,,33,3.857142857142857
8145451,5,B000IHYRYA,fast delivery as promised and best thing the kid loves it,1407110400,,57,4.2727272727272725
8145452,5,B000IHYRYA,This is such a well presented video.  My little 2 year old grandson watches it over and over.  I love that they get a little education with spelling in the mix.  Excellent for any little one who loves big machinery.,1380844800,,215,4.325
8145453,5,B000IHYRYA,these videos are great entertainment for little boys -- can't believe how still they sit when watching them....buy all the versions,1374364800,,131,5.285714285714286
8145454,5,B000IHYRYA,"My son has some minor speech delays but one of his first ""big"" words came from this video.  Whenever we are out and he sees a digger he calls out a cheerful ""hey digger!""  It's too cute.  The Totally Trucks videos are perfect for him.  He loves any and all trucks.  He has learned what the different trucks do and likes to point them out now.  Anything that gets him talking is a great thing in my book.  These videos aren't too content heavy, not too flashy and visually annoying, and cover a couple simple things (this one covers the alphabet, as sung from the truck's POV) but not too much.
These videos are great for the younger kids, up to about age 5 based on our family.  They're also easy for mom and dad to watch with our kids.  They aren't irritating and too tempting to make fun of like some other kids shows.",1363824000,,820,4.2387096774193544
8145455,5,B000IHYRYA,My grandson thinks this is the greatest DVD.  Looking forward to watching with him on my next visit.  Great service.,1298764800,,116,4.75
8145456,3,B000IHYRYA,This video was o.k. Some parts seem a little slow. This is basically just music with pictues of construction trucks. We like videos that are more informative.,1283299200,,158,4.888888888888889
8145457,1,B000IHYRYA,"Great videos.  Shipping took FOREVER... I paid almost $18.00 in shipping for 6 videos, and it took about 3 weeks to get here =(.... I figured for that much in shipping, they would come priority, but they came parcel.  I would not reccomend this seller unless you have a lot of time to wait.",1250467200,,290,4.351851851851852
