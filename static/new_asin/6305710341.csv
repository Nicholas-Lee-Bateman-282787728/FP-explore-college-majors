If you are also looking for some puppies to satisfy your  day, this is it!  PLease get this video.  You will love it!",949795200,,276,3.857142857142857
1059120,3,6305710341,"Now, the one great point about Armageddon is that it beats the previous pay-per-view, Survivor Series, by a country mile.  However, this show was not the wonder that we should have expected to cap off 1999.
Stars worthy  of credit include the Hardy Boyz and the Acolytes, who excelled themeselves  in the opening tag team battle royal.  Kudos also to Chris Jericho and  Chyna, who managed to better their performance the previous month, and pull  out a really entertaining contest.  And, a bit of sportmanship at the end  from the loser.  Blimey!
If I had bullets, they would go into the head  of the Big Show and the Big Boss Man, who stunk out the building in a 5  minute snooze-fest that should have been a spectactular World Title  culmination to a really disgusting and tasteless storyline - watch the bio  before, you'll see what I mean.
As far as Triple H and Vince McMahon's  streetfight go, it was fine, but way too long, and way to gimmick-filled.  They stroll around outside the building for a good 5 minutes, doing bugger  all.  Yet the ending is strong, and the post-match action is worthy of you  purchasing this.  I knew what was going to happen, I wonder if you  did/will.
Overall, not a bad show, but not great either.  If you want to  buy a rip roaring pay-per-view, wait until next month, when the Royal  Rumble is released.",949449600,,1343,4.5738396624472575

It was simply one of the worst ppv i ve ever seen and i can tell you i watched most of the ppv these last 4 years 'till last Bad Blood 2003.
The show was pathetic;a good symbol to describe this event is the story line between Big bossman(how old is this man? 254 years old?) and the death of Big Show's father...No comment on the Bossman coming up at the cimetary to take the casket...Who the  he thinks he is? THE UNDERTAKER?
Another very bad match was the one with Triple H and Vince simply idiot as the bookers of the time..
And let's not forget the triple threat match between val venis ,d'lo and I don't remember the last one...
Only confused and slow moves in this event; a good point for the rock n sock connection who made this disaster a PPV...",1057968000,,789,4.1568627450980395
1059187,4,6305710341,"This was not the best ppv of 1999, but it ranks higher than the majority of them.  The good matches on the card was the triple threat match for the European title between The Bulldog, Val Venis, and D'Lo Brown, The Tag Team Title match between the New Age Outlaws and Mankind and Rock, A rematch from the Survivor Series for the IC title between Chyna and Y2J and the main event between HHH and The Rock.  The lowpoints to the show was the Heavyweight Title match between the Big Show and The Big Boss Man, which is not surprising since The Big Boss Man's matches are always bad in this day and age.  The Cage Match between Kane and X-Pac was alright but could have been a whole lot better.  The Battle Royal for the #1 contenders for the tag team titles was fair as well as Blackman vs Angle.

Like the 3 way European title match: Val vs Bulldog vs D'lo was a good match and so was the 4 corner evening gown in a pool elimination match: jacky vs b.b. vs ivory vs kat basically because there was a cat fight in a pool between 4 of the hottest ladies and some nudity at the end. The rest is all mishmash as a team of almost 1,000 lbs, that is, Big Vis and Rikishi vs 2 mid-weights in an extremely dumb match and not to mention the 3 minute WWF Championship match between Big Show and Big Bossman which we all knew the outcome was. Big Bossman as the champion? Might as well put the belt on Howard Finkel.
So Anywayz, the main event wasn't bad but wasn't good, as Vince isn't really a wrestler so the match wasn't 100% awesome, but the ending was shocking. As i said earlier, please RENT before buying. overall a 7 out of 10 PPV",996883200,,961,4.144385026737968

It was great the pool evening gound match was one of the best. After kat won the wwf womens title she said she knew every one came to see hear get naked so she toke off her bra but only for a second because officials came out and coverd her.there where a couple of good matchs. But lets talk about the last match vince mcmahon vs hhh was good in it's own ways vince and hhh were on the scafold fighting they both whent about 50 feet down on to a army truck full of sacks but in that match was the beginning of the mcmahon hemsley faction or regeim what ever you want to call it.

1059253,4,6305710341,"WWF Armageddon, the last WWF PPV of the 20th Century (for those who believe the new millenium starts at the year 2000), ranks up there as one of 1999's best.  I think in this PPV, almost no attention was paid to the  WWF Championship.  Who wanted to see Big Show vs. Bossman?  Big Show's  title reign is one of the worst ever, isn't it?  Anyway, all the attention  was focused on the DX and McMahon feud.  Both groups were making each  others' lives living hells:  Vince screws HHH out of the WWF title at  Survivor Series; HHH crashes in on the wedding between Test and Stephanie  McMahon to show hilarious footage of HHH getting hitched to a knocked out  Steph; Vince rams his car into the side of DX's limo; HHH has him arrested;  Vince throws HHH off the entrance ledge; the match is made.  If Vince wins,  HHH absolutely CANNOT go for the gold anymore and must divorce Steph; if  HHH wins, he can keep his beloved wife.
Armageddon's matches consist of a  tag-team battle to determine number one contenders for the Tag Titles at  Royal Rumble.  Fairly decent, though I didn't think Acolytes would win.  Kurt Angle vs. Steve Blackman match is pretty dull, same with Rikishi and  Viscera vs. The Hollys.  IC Champion Chyna and Challenger Chris Jericho  give another excellent match, with a more satisfying end to all you  Jerichoholics out there.  The rivalry between these two was quite  entertaining, what with Jericho smashing Chyna's thumb in the day after  Survivor Series.  European title match between champion Bulldog, Val Venis,  and D'Lo Brown, is nothing to rave about.  After a short and disappointing  match at Survivor Series, X-Pac and Kane fight yet again in a steel cage.  It's pretty good, kept me watching. The Rock N' Sock Connection vs. The  Outlaws drew good reaction from the crowd, though it's awkward end seemed  only fitting.  The Big Show vs. Bossman was quick, thank God - smart  booking on that one.
HHH vs. Vince - what could we expect from Vince, who  had already done a ladder match and a steel cage match earlier in that  year?  Steph comes down to the ring before the match, looking all innocent,  rooting for her father.  The psychology between HHH and Vince was  brilliant, too, and that only made the match more exciting.  HHH and Vince  do a good number on each other and use the decorating props from the aisle  to do more damage.  It even goes outside to where HHH nearly kills Vince  with a car.  Both men provide a real treat, and you got to give Vince a lot  of credit for the bumps he takes.  HHH ends up victorious, having knocked  out Vince with a sledgehammer.  And just as he's about to hit Steph, she  turns around, the two stare at each other, Steph cracks a smirk, and ...  they hug!  WE'VE BEEN PLAYED!
And that is how the McMahon/Helmsley  Era started, my friends.",960595200,3,2819,4.559356136820925
1059254,4,6305710341,"The best match of this PPV is hands down the No Holds Barred match between Triple H and Vince McMahon. It was really exciting and had that great surprise twist at the end. The 16 man tag-team elimination match was also  cool. A great WWF moment was after the Four Corners Evening Match between  Ms. Kitty, Jacqueline, Ivory, and B.B. for the WWF Women's Championship.  The WWF Title Match was a joke. Boss Man didn't last three minutes in the  ring with the Big Show, and neither did Prince Albert. The Superheavyweight  Match between Rikishi & Viscera and the Hollys was kinda boring. The IC  Title Match was really good. Val Venis, D'Lo Brown, and the British Bulldog  did great in the Triple-Threat European Title Match. The Steel Cage match  with kane and X-Pac was a little too predictable. The Rock 'n' Sock  Connection was so close to winning the Tag Team Belts. Buy this one.",956016000,,883,4.608974358974359

Then comes Chris Jerico v Chyna for the  Intercontinental Championship. Good match. Next is the Rock & Sock  connection v the New Age Outlaws. This is a worthwille seeing match. Big  Boss Man v The Big Show  for the the WWF Championship. These 2 really hate  each other and I mean really. Then comes Vince McMahon v Tripple H which is  one of the best matches I've ever seen.

The final WWF PPV of the 1990s kicked off with a 8 team Battle Royal to determine the new #1 Contenders for the WWF Tag Team Championships. There was no tagging in this match as all teams were in the ring trying to throw other teams out--so in a way a Tag Team Royal Rumble match. This was an interesting and fun match to kick off the show that openly displayed all the great Tag Teams the company had to offer around this time. The end comes with Faarooq sickly launching Jeff out of the ring and Bradshaw knocking Matt off the apron for the win

Lillian Garcia interviews Kurt Angle in the back and Angle states he's still undefeated and puts the blame on Steve Blackman for them losing to the Dudleyz on Smackdown

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2.) Kurt Angle vs Steve Blackman

Fair paced match that was a bit similar to Angle's debut match at Survivor Series. A little bit of back and forth action but Angle gets the best of Blackman with a bridged German suplex for the win. Blackman not happy about the match loss, assaults Angle with his nunchucks following the match

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWF Women's Championship Evening Gown Pool Match: Miss Kitty vs Jacqueline vs B.B vs Ivory (c) (Special Referees: Mae Young and Fabulous Moolah)

The match starts before Ivory can even make her entrance as Jacqueline, Kitty, and and B.B are already in the pool. Ivory tries to stall but she's pulled in by the others and the match officially begins. The winner would be the remaining diva who managed to keep her gown on. Ivory, B.B., and Kitty work together to strip Jacqueline's gown off, eliminating her first. B.B is next as the champion and Kitty rip her gown off just seconds after. Ivory tries to take off B.B's bra to expose those double E boobs that would've probably would've popped out of that bra anyway. Kat pulls Ivory back in the pool and B.B gets away, which didn't sit well with the crowd. Soon after, Kitty rips off Ivory's gown to win the match and the championship. Following the match, Kat satisfies the crowd by taking off her gown and pulls her top off, exposing her boobs to every lucky man that was live in the audience, while it was censored for those of us watching at home. Almost a second after taking her top off, Sgt. Slaughter is there to cover her up with a towel. Mae Young would try to get in on the fun by taking off her clothes but she too was stopped by Slaughter. That'd be nothing compared to what she tried the following month at the Royal Rumble. But that's another review for another time. Short but fun match from the divas

In a pre-match backstage interview with Kevin Kelly; Rikishi cuts a promo on Crash and Hardcore Holly and claims he'll put his backside in their face and tells Viscera to have his back

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Hardcore Holly and Crash Holly vs Viscera and Rikishi

Short and odd match here. Viscera seemingly didn't want partner with Rikishi and Kish almost wins the match on his own until Vis steps in to take charge for a while. Rikishi tags himself back in and Viscera accidentally knocks him down with a spinning wheel kick that was meant for Hardcore. Hardcore gets the pinfall win and Rikishi and Viscera fight to the back. This match was better off happening on Raw, Smackdown, or even Heat over the PPV

5.) WWF European Championship Triple Threat Match: D'Lo Brown vs Val Venis vs The British Bulldog (c)

Decent showing from the 3 competitors in this match but nothing too spectacular. Venis hits the Money Shot on both D'Lo and Bulldog and pins Bulldog to win the European Championship

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) Steel Cage Match: Kane w/Tori vs X-Pac

Kane had demanded to be in a Cage with X-Pac and because of which, X-Pac decided that the only way Kane could win was by pinfall, while he could pin Kane or climb over the cage. Things start off with X-Pac locking Kane inside the cage and trying to make sexual advances on Tori, but Kane climbs over the cage and gets in a few shots on his former tag partner before getting hit with the ring bell. The fight eventually goes inside the cage and the match is eventually under way. It's a bit hard not to watch this match with a big grin, because you get to hear Lawler make several sexual innuendos about Kane and Tori throughout the course of it. As Kane starts to get the offense on X-Pac, the New Age Outlaws rush to ringside with bolt cutters. The Outlaws manage to break the chain to the door and slam the cage door in Kane's face and leave Pac with a steel chair and pair of handcuffs before retreating to the back. Pac lands an X-Factor on the steel chair and prepares to escape the cage but Tori comes in and pulls him down and gets an X-Factor as a result. Kane uses a clever way to prevent X-Pac from escaping. The finish comes with Kane performing a diving clothesline off the top of the cage. followed by a Tombstone Piledriver for the win.

8.) WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs Chyna (c) w/Miss Kitty

We start off with nice fast-paced back and forth action from Jericho and Chyna in their final one-on-one PPV encounter. Jericho was still considered a heel but the fans were quickly coming on to him, so he was practically a face in this match along with Chyna. Chyna's right thumb was kayfabe injured leading up to the PPV as Jericho had demolished it with a hammer, so the right hand got worked over a bit. After a great back and forth match, Jericho makes Chyna tap out to win his first of 9 Intercontinental Championships

9.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: The Rock n Sock Connection vs The New Age Outlaws (c)

Another terrific match follows up in this Tag Team Championship match. The Rock n Sock/New Age Outlaws feud was a greatly booked feud that tends to get overlooked by other Tag Team feuds that happened in the latter of the Attitude Era. Funny moment in the match where Billy Gunn tries to show off by taking off his shirt but gets attacked by Rock with the shirt stuck over his head. The referee gets bumped into which brings out Al Snow who attacks Mankind and makes his exit. Road Dogg goes for the pin but Rock drags out the referee and goes after Snow. As the match reaches its peak, The Rock takes out The Outlaws and finishes off Gunn with a Rock Bottom. The Rock goes for the pin but it's broken by Al Snow who comes back to the ring and attacks Rock leading to a DQ finish. The Outlaws both eat Rock Bottoms before Snow takes one himself followed by a People's Elbow as a measure of revenge

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

10.) WWF Championship Match: Big Boss Man w/Prince Albert vs The Big Show (c)

The story around this match was Big Boss Man consistently taking personal shots at Big Show's family--mainly his dad who had died and was on the receiving end of brutal jokes from Boss Man. A new layer was added after Boss Man did some research on Show's background and discovered he was born before his parents were married and began referring to Show as a ""bastard"". Boss Man cuts a pre-match promo on Show saying that anyone in the crowd could be Show's dad, but after he takes the WWF Championship, he'll be the one who's known as Show's daddy. Show storms to the ring and dismantles Boss Man while the crowd chanted boring. Boss Man gets in a little bit of offense, but a Chokeslam later and the match is over. I'm pretty sure the fan reaction to this feud is not what WWF expected. They tried to make it worthwhile to get Boss Man over as a heel and Show over as a sympathetic face, but it failed on both ends. Just like the feud, this match--despite it being only around 3 minutes was uncomfortable to watch and fortunately this match marked the end of the feud

The build-up to this feud was simply amazing. After Vince returned to WWF television in September 1999, he become embroiled in a deeply personal feud with Triple H. It didn't really become that way until after Vince cost Triple H the championship at Survivor Series. As payback, Triple H drugged, kidnapped, and married Stephanie McMahon against her will at a Las Vegas drive thru wedding, which has become one of the most memorable moments of the Attitude Era. As a result, a No Holds Barred match between Vince and Triple H was made with the stipulation that if Vince won, the marriage was off. But if Triple H won, he not only got to keep Stephanie but got a WWF Championship match as well. Stephanie comes to ringside and watches the match with a front row seat. The main event was brutally awesome! Vince starts things off throwing powder in HHH's eyes and gets in some early offense over The Game. What follows is a violent back and forth fight between the 2. Vince blades following a shot to the head with a gas can. Of course, it's no spoiler that Triple H wins and following the bout; Stephanie enters the ring and embraces with Triple H to begin the McMahon-Helmsley Regime that would bring in 2000 with a force

Overall: There wasn't a better way the WWF could have their final PPV of the 90s than with Armageddon. While matches like Rikishi/Viscera vs Hollys and Show/Boss Man had no business being on the card to begin with, I'll be nice and not let those matches take away from the PPV itself. The opening Tag Team Battle Royal was great, Jericho and Chyna had yet another awesome IC Title bout on PPV, the Tag Team Championship match was well done, and the main event between McMahon and Triple H was terrific in every way imaginable. I give the 1999 Armageddon nothing less than a 5/5 stars",1418342400,,10926,5.1374647887323945

December 12, 1999

National Car Rental Center

Fort Lauderdale, Florida

Tag Team Battle Royal:

Edge & Christian V. Hardy Boyz V. Dudley Boyz V. Acolytes V. Headbangers V. Too Cool V. Mean Street Posse V. Godfather & Mark Henry

Good opener that had some great spots in it and was very good near the end. The Acolytes win. **3/4

Kurt Angle V. Steve Blackman

This match could have been better if Angle wasn't so green. Some good wrestling from Angle, but not a really good match at all. Angle wins. *1/2

Evening Gown In A Pool Match for the WWF Women's Championship:

Ivory (Champion) V. Miss Kitty V. Jacqueline V. BB

three letters...DUD. However, you did get to see Kitty's little puppies so...it's all good. Kitty wins by the way.

Hollys V. Viscera & Rikishi

Not a good match but was some what watchable. The Hollys win. *1/2

Triple Threat Match for the WWF European Championship:

British Bulldog (Champion) V. Val Venis V. D'Lo Brown

Good match that could have been better if given more time and if there were better wrestlers in there. Val wins. ***

Steel Cage Match:

Kane V. X-Pac

short match. Good, but not that good. That seems to be the theme of this ppv. kane wins. ***

WWF Intercontinental Championship:

Chyna (Champion) V. Chris Jericho

I hate to say it, this was the match of the night. However, that doesn't mean that it's a awesome match. it was actually solid and good. Jericho wins and wins the title for all man. No not mankind...for all man. I am not sexist. I just don't think Chyna was Intercontinental Championship material. ***1/2

WWF Tag Team Championship:

New Age Outlaws (Champion) V. Rock & Mankind

Good match that was better than what Foley says it was...but not that much better. Rock & Kind win but by DQ. **3/4

WWF Championship:

Big Show (Champion) V. Big Bossman

The storyline was awesome...the match wasn't. I can say that it's the only WWF Championship match that I have ever seen that was a DUD. Show wins.

No Holds Barred Match:

Triple H V. Vince McMahon

This match was, for me, hard to watch. There was way too many weapons and not even selling of the weapons. The did go just about everywhere in the building. Triple H wins. ***

overall, way too matches so the matches that needed time didn't get it.",1143417600,2,2280,4.580645161290323
7892907,4,6305710341,"This tape is really great. All the matches (except the Viscera/Rikishi match and the Evening gown match) are pretty good. Here are the matches and what I think of them:

1. The Acolytes def. Edge/Christian, The Dudleys, Godfather/Mark Henry, Too Cool, The Mean Street Posse, The Hardys, and (some other team I forget) in an 8-team battle royal to get a shot at the Tag Titles at the Rumble 2000 - not too bad I guess. Just a regular battle royal. This featured some of my favorite teams (Acolytes, Hardys, Edge/Christian/Dudleys) so it was pretty good. Rating: 9/10

2. Kurt Angle def. Steve Blackman - good match here with Angle winning with a German Suplex? I guess the match wasn't too bad. Pretty solid all the way through. Rating: 8/10

3. Miss Kitty wins an Evening Gown Match to win the Women's title - I forget (once again!) the names of who competed in this match. Was ok for the women to have, but after the match Miss Kitty takes her bra off. Rating: 6/10

4. Hardcore Holly/Crash def. Viscera/Rikishi - nothing special or great about this match. Thats all I can say about this one. Rating: 5/10

5. Val Venis def. D'lo Brown and The British Bulldog in a Triple Threat Match to win the European Title - this was acually one of my favorite matches of the night. Very solid and consistent all the way through. Rating: 10/10

6. Kane def. X-Pac in a Steel Cage Match - not too bad, but maybe could have gone on a bit longer. We saw Kane jump from the top of the cage with a clothesline, so that was pretty good. Wasn't all that brutal like I was hoping it could be, but any event with Kane from 1997-1999 is worth buying. :D Rating: 9.5/10

7. Chris Jericho def. Chyna to win the Intercontinental Title - not a bad match either. Jericho makes Chyna tap to the Walls of Jericho. Rating: 9/10

8. The New Age Outlaws def. The Rock and Sock Connection to retain the Tag Titles - good match here with Rock and Billy Gun beating the hell out of each other. Match ends with Al Snow attacking Mankind, resulting in a DQ finish. Rating: 9/10

9. The Big Show def. Big Boss Man to retain the WWF Championship - I thought this match would be great but wasn't. A WWF Championship match just can't be like 3 or 4 minutes long. I'm going to give it a good rating only because we saw Albert get chokeslammed through the announce table. Rating: 8/10

10. Triple H def. Vince McMahon in a No Holds Barred match - this match was worth the entire price of the tape altogether. This match was VERY brutal. What it is is about 30 minutes of Vince/Triple H just beating the hell out of each other. Rating: 11/10 (that was intentional, meaning this was one of my favorite matches ever in the WWF)

So, basically this PPV could have had better matches, such as the WWF Championship match and the Viscera/Rikishi match, but it went ok. If you like hardcore matches, be sure to get this one as the main event is FILLED with that, and the steel cage/WWF title matches have a little bit of it, but not much.",1113177600,5,2988,4.365765765765766
