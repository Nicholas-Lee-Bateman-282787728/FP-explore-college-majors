2334124,4,B0009XBR6O,"I've had this on a VHS tape for several years and I've noticed people are either horrifed or love this documentary. I've noticed the break is sort similar to feelings about Shelby Lee Adams photography.

I like this film- it's got great dancing and the mud bog scene always makes me smile (and everyone else who has ever mud bogged!)On the otherhand I've got redneck relatives who won't watch it for fear of being offended....
Violence, alcoholism, exploitation, and poverty of all sorts exist on every socio-economic level- and I guess if that's what you want to latch onto when you watch this- then you'll be offended-
For myself, I see Jesco as someone who is really passionate about what he's doing-he's pretty good at it, and he defies sterotypes- I think the last thing you can say about this guy is he's not true to himself-
Check out ""Tater Tomater"" too if you like this :)",1188950400,2,881,4.611464968152866
2334125,2,B0009XBR6O,"After reading the reviews and awards this documentary has received I was excited to watch it with a friend for whom I'd gotten as a gift.  After seeing it I was embarrassed at my selection.  Neither of us found the poverty, ignorance, and alcoholism that envelopes this hillbilly culture remotely entertaining.  Pitiful is more the word for it.  Jesco isn't anyone we can identify or empathize with either as a person or for his struggle live up to his father's talent which he obviously didn't inherit. Jesco talks in retrospect about his wilder days which, by the time this film was made, were long over.  Jesco sits surrounded by his Elvis paraphenalia with nothing much interesting to say at this point.  Jesco on the porch of his trailer talking about his squirrel rifle.  Ya.  The real story here would have been about Jesco's father who was tragically murdered in a dispute with neighbors.  You don't have to know anything about this style of mountain dancing to know he was the true master of it. As a final note, perhaps mercifully or not, this film is way too short.  In the version I bought there are some boring outtakes and a Part 2 where Jesco goes to Hollywood to appear on Rosanne.  I guess Tom Arnold thought this was good.",1171238400,6,1240,4.616438356164384
2334126,5,B0009XBR6O,"For the uninitiated, this is a documentary about Jesco White, ""the last of the mountain dancers,"" and his wild and crazy family. This little acre of Mulletland is pervaded by gasoline huffin', whiskey drinkin', shotgun shootin' madness, as well as loyalty to family, love for Elvis and naivete about just what the filmmaker, Jacob Young, is doing.

""The Dancing Outlaw"" is a masterpiece in a genre all its own. Its strength is found in the tension between the absolute hilarity of the dialogue from its main characters (Jesco, Norma Rae, Mayme, Birty Mae and Dorsey) and the guilt one feels about having fun at someone else's expense. It is uncomfortable for most of us to like people and laugh at them at the same time, but it is a powerful mix perfected in this gem. Guilty pleasures are sometimes the best ones, right?

Phrases, sentences, and stories from ""The Dancing Outlaw"" will stick in your mind for years to come. I guess you could call this genre ""comedic ethnography,"" as it comes in a public TV, Appalachian anthropology package. But seriously folks, no one watches this to learn tap dancing steps...

I am proud to have tracked Jesse, Mayme and kin down in Boone County back in 1994, and spent an enjoyable afternoon with them. Friendly folks with great stories and a penchant for unforgettable conversation. I didn't even get shot at. In the neck, I mean.

Jesco had a brief shot at stardom (he guested on ""Roseanne"" back in the 90s), but it seems fame and fortune have now passed him by. It is a shame that he and the White clan (and Jacob Young, for that matter) did not profit more from this wonderful film.",1155686400,5,1625,4.651567944250871
2334127,4,B0009XBR6O,"I noticed two main differences between the ""Dancing Outlaw"" DVD with ""Dancing Outlaw II"" by Jacob Young and the original documentary as shown on WV public television.  In the original, when Jesse is relating the ""tragety"" of the shooting that killed D.Ray and wounded Dorsey and Jesse, he says ""That was the first time I had been shot in the neck before.""  The DVD has a different cut in which Jesse leaves out ""before"".  The second difference I noticed was that Bertie May, in the first version said about D. Ray ""He knew 52 more steps than any other."" That was the whole sentence. In the DVD a different take is used in which she says ""He knew 52 more steps than any other mountain dancer.""  Better English but both changes take away the quirky eccentricity of the original versions.

They seem like minor differences but to us purists they are significant.

For the uninitiated, just don't watch ""Dancing Outlaw II, Jessco Goes to Hollywood.""  It will destroy the fresh honesty that still shows through in the new ""Dancing Outlaw.""",1138492800,6,1034,4.711111111111111
2334128,5,B0009XBR6O,"I had the world DVD premiere for this film in February 2005 at the South Charleston Museum in South Charleston, WV. Hundreds showed up - and for good reason. It is the best selling film ever made inside West Virginia - about a West Virginian. It is also the best short documentary about an unusual man and his life ever made, making my Top Ten list of all times - in Facets Multimedia. The director, Jacob Young, watched films by Les Blank and Errol Morris, and using some of their style and his own, created a masterpiece. At one time the state library of West Virginia had at least 8 copies of this film, loaning all of them out for a decade or more. It is hilarious, sad, tragic, insightful - and about everything else one can show in a film. It stands with any film, including Errol Morris' masterpieces like THE FOG OF WAR.",1124064000,19,828,4.348387096774194

2334142,5,B0009XBR6O,"Sometimes real life is stranger than fiction and Jesco White and his family definitely prove this.  We lived in WV when Jesco became famous after this documentary was made and aired.  We were not too far from where Jesco lived--but it could have been a world away.  If different cultures appeal to you then you must see this train wreck of a way of life.  I must say that not many of the people in that part of WV live the way Jesco and family do, but sadly the Whites live an existence that is both bewildering and oddly humorous. Watching this documentary is a roller coaster of emotions that range from hilarity to disgust to sympathy.",1383696000,,638,4.427350427350428

Jessco White is a true American, by God, West Virginian who kept up a beautiful tradition of mountain tap-dancing. It is a shame to see in The Wonderful Whites of West Virginia that he isn't as spry as he was when this documentary was filmed.  There are 2 documentaries in one.  The second one is when he goes to Hollywood to be on the Roseanne show! I forgot how much I loved Rosanne! I would love to buy a dvd set of her tv shows,especially, the one with Jessco White!!!!!!!!! He is a real true blue American with talent and originality! Fun and touching.",1355443200,,627,4.3418803418803416
2334151,5,B0009XBR6O,"This documentary is well worth it.  If you have seen the Wild Wonderful Whites of West Virginia and loved it then this is a must see.  The Dancing Outlaw gives you a much clearer sense and appreciation of Jesco White's Appalachian dance style and his desire to do something great for himself, his family, and everyone else he can entertain with his gift.  I have good friends who are from and still live in this region of West Virginia, and I will tell you that this is an honest depiction of some great and interesting people that the rest of the States could not even imagine actually exist.  I recommend this video for anyone who has an appreciation for Appalachia and all of its small tight kept subcultures.",1347926400,5,712,4.5390625

I wasn't disappointed.  Actually, I was surprised that Jesco was on Roseanne years ago.  I had no idea!  Too bad Roseanne's producers didn't let his dancing on the show be allowed on Dancing Outlaw.  But I was able to find it on You Tube.  Overall, a real hoot to watch.  Thanks.",1321574400,,495,4.556818181818182

2334159,5,B0009XBR6O,"I had a copy I purchased from West Virginia Public Television after being shown the documentary by a friend's dad.

Needless to say, a mere plot summary does not encompass the jaw-droppingly hilarious and sad details of Jesco White's existance. But, basically, it is the story of Jesco White and his endeavours to take the skills as a mountain dancer his father passed on to him and the roadblocks placed by family and life. It is also a very interesting sociological document on how the other half lives.

The outtakes are quite interesting.

Dancing Outlaw II is just plain stupid. The unfortunate thing about this show is the players are self-aware. So instead of verit&eacute;, you get these people doing bits. This show is about Jesco's debut on Roseanne. Don't even bother.

She let me borrow the DVD and I have never laughed so hard.  According to my boyfriend it is extremely accurate about how it depicts the rural West Virginian poverty.

Only drawback: No subtitles!  I couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue, as the Appalacian Accent is so thick.  I know that they are speaking English, but I couldn't understand a lot of it!  Solution:  Watch it with my boyfriend!! (he's from Fayette County right next to Boone County!) I had to pause it so he could translate. (His Mother is called ""The Miracle Woman."")

An interesting sport I was not aware of before: ""Muddin.'"" This sport is  the activity of drinking beer and driving your car and/or dirt bike all up in the mud.  The person who gets the most mud on his/her car/bike gets ""braggin rights.""

(My point is: no matter where you go, someone will find someplace else to goof on...unless it's Boone County).

In lesser hands, this film could've been just a freak show slapped together, but I found it as earnest and sympathetic as it was outrageous and hilarious.  I don't know if it's because my family originally came from the hills but I couldn't help but like Jesco (although the evil Jesco was spooky) and the Elvis personality (might be a regional thing when it comes to Elvis).
