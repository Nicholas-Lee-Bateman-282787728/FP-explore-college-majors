7808555,5,6300271048,I watched the film when it first came out and I'm finding it hard to get a hold of a copy of the film,1520294400,,101,3.25
7808556,5,6300271048,"I saw this movie a year or two after it's release, around 1984 or 1985, and I've loved it ever since! I'm still waiting for it to be released on DVD, though I did manage to find a pretty decent original in terms of picture and sound on VHS. Jane Snowden and Alexandre Sterling play the leads. Snowden is Jenny, a somewhat shy English girl traveling to France to study at the Sorbonne and Sterling plays Jean Pierre, a VERY handsome, charming young Frenchman who meets Jenny in a nightclub. The romance goes pretty quickly from there as Jean Pierre, though somewhat shy himself, seems a bit wiser in the ways of the world. The Romeo and Juliet recitation near the end of the movie is so naively romantic......but I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone! In this age of sophistication, this movie is refreshing.....you owe it to yourself to see it, you won't be sorry!",1378684800,,870,4.512658227848101
7808557,3,6300271048,Disappointed in the lack of sub-titles as the conversations were difficult to understand because of the signal to noise ratios. We love Jane Snowden and the story was interesting.,1362873600,,179,5.206896551724138
7808558,5,6300271048,"Although somewhat neglected in the world of cinema, this charming little tale of love in Paris remains a classic of the genre, and unfortunately, hasn't yet been released on DVD!
Give New Line some time, and this will be rectified, I'm sure.  But I fell in love with the final scene with its Romeo And Juliet recitation amongst a crowd of people which was nothing if not cinematic magic.
If you can find a copy, do yourself a favour and please check it out.  One of the best date movies of all time.",1070236800,5,499,4.354838709677419
