8103896,3,B000E1GOT6,"This movie is more ""dark"" than funny. Plenty of interesting characters and good acting, but it  may leave you feeling confused and empty, so to speak. There's hardly any film footage of the great comedic actor Charles Busch, who starred in many clever and hilarious plays in Greenwich Village a few decades ago that I thoroughly enjoyed, and this is a reminder of his great talent and ability to make us laugh.",1426723200,,410,4.694444444444445
8103897,5,B000E1GOT6,Funny and absorbing.,1408492800,,20,6.0
8103898,3,B000E1GOT6,Trouble on the Corner was pretty much as it is described.  Not a stellar movie but something to view if you have time to kill.  I would not buy this again.,1383264000,2,155,3.967741935483871
