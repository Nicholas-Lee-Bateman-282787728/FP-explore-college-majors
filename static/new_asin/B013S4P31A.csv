8728670,5,B013S4P31A,I played with Tubbs on his visit to Bristol in 1956. I played drums in a jazz quartet at a pub called The Crown and Dove. We played  upstairs in a room that probably held 50 people at most. That  night there were  at least double that. In between set I talked to Tubby non stop. He made me feel as if  I had known  him for ever. The best I  had ever played was that night. A lovely man.  This book is a  true  reflection of the man and his music. I showed up  at almost every one of his gigs after thhat night. Thanks Simon.,1510617600,,524,3.8130841121495327
8728671,4,B013S4P31A,"I have been a huge Tubby Hayes fan since the mid 1990's when I first discovered his music through my love of the late great British pianist Gordon Beck.  Having first heard the two seminal, now classic, jazz albums, ""Late Spot at Scott's"" and ""Down in the Village"" on Fontana Records my obsession and addiction with all things Tubbs had begun.  It took me many years and much money to track down and buy all of Tubby's original LP's on Fontana and Tempo but I managed to acquire almost all of them except for a few of the Tempo LP's.  I also went even further down the rabbit hole and tracked down 90% of Tubby's sideman appearances in addition to countless radio broadcasts and rare acetates and transcription discs et al..

""A Man In a Hurry"" is a very well produced and directed documentary and the producers of this fine film are to be commended for their efforts in making sure that the Hayes legacy is maintained for future generations of musicians.  Well done.

I found the archival footage and the interviews throughout to be well paced and interspersed so as to preserve the story being told.  My only complaint is that I wish it was longer.  Clocking in at at 56 minutes it does manage to accurately capture the Tubbs story from birth to tragic death but another 30 minutes of footage would have been even better.  With that said that is a small issue and again they do manage to capture the story within the 56 minute time frame.

It also would have been nice to mention the late great pianist Gordon Beck somewhere in the film as he was a vital and important part of Tubbs band in the early 1960's.

For those interested in hearing Gordon Beck with Tubby you may want to check out the Tubby Hayes Quartet-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commonwealth-Blues/dp/B000AA4GIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commonwealth Blues</a>&nbsp;CD which includes pianist Gordon Beck, drummer Johnny Butts, bassist Jeff Clyne and Tubby on tenor saxophone and vibes and was recorded at BBC studios in 1965.  Sadly, none of these great musicians are with us any longer but their spirit and music will live on.
