8203880,5,B000S1L3WU,Kind of a fun DVD.  Especially in the winter because it has two fireplace/burning fires.  Almost feels warm.  Fishscapes are also nice.,1369958400,,135,5.045454545454546
8203881,3,B000S1L3WU,"i got the version called 15 amazing environments but i think it is the same one. i like it very much you can choose if you want music or not on at least one of the disks ,

my main reason for doing this review is to warn people of the dvd  and the cases mounting center / hub. i have had mine a few years. the center is breaking away and seems to be caused by the hub having too much pressure on the dvd centers edges.  the dvd center seems to be in 2 layers and the top one is coming loose when the dvd is pressed onto the hub. i have 2 pieces missing from dvd 1 now. i think pressing the hub (like it says) may help in not causing damage. both dvds have cracks near the dvd center whee the hub touches them.",1327536000,,709,3.777027027027027
8203882,5,B000S1L3WU,"I absolutely love this product, I put it in when I take a nap, when I clean or have company. I highly recommend this set",1322870400,,120,3.84
8203883,5,B000S1L3WU,"I agree with C. Pierce.  Except perhaps, I've bought the $20 ones, and the $10 ones, and my goodness gracious ""Agnes""., C. Pierce was SO RIGHT!  Greatest Value.  2 cd's with different environments.  Be sure to read C. Pierce's review which outlines very nice specifc details which helped me purchase this myself!  My experience can add a few details of note:

Such a grand array of options and videos, it is hard to give an idea.  I will discuss Fireplace and Which CD to use for what (you decide based on what each does).

DISC 1, My favorite for Fireplace, Ocean, Sunset, Psych, Clouds, ... Gives Choice, Music and Sounds, or just Natural Sounds.  Loops itself.
(The fireplace on Disc 2 does not loop, is music only, rather short, and so next thing you know you are watching a fish tank.  LOL.  I use CD-2 for looping aquariums with music when I want just that! It is breathtaking)

DISC 1.  The favorite for natural sounds, and variety (Sunsets, Oceans, Aquariums, all other).  because it has choice of either music or natural sounds.  Disc 1 HAS THE MOST VARIED OPTIONS - has fun FIREWORKS, oceans, streams, clouds, sunsets.  I believe each loops itself, I've been watching one now for over an hour, each one, and on they go.  NICE!  You can select what you want, (best fireplace options, great ocean sounds...), great natural sounds, or music too - your option on Disc 1.

DISC 1.  PSYCHEDELIC addition:  I didn't even want to try this, didn't care, and really thought YUK on this small part of the DVD - -- had so many other wonderful things that worked for me as I'd hoped.  Then, I clicked on this one out of curiosity.  LOL.  Guess what, this brings up - let's do aerobics, or clean the house, and MOVE BABY.  Thing is, I found this to be valuable.  Useful - for when I want to have something as a backdrop for cleaning house or aerobics indoors.  VERY SURPRISED. AGain, See Note2, I do not SIT and watch this stuff, I have it as background for my life and environments when I want to add ambiance.  The music on this one is very different than the entire DVD.  However, it does motivate one to do housework or exercise!  Then look up, and woah, crazy kaleidoscopic visuals when you pass by!

DISC 2, Best for Musical Aquarium.  Easy to do just one thing - watch several aquariums with music (again no choice on Disc 2, music only).  Very nice to have, and know, EASY- POP IT IN - it plays several aquariums (beautiful) with very soothing music and sounds.  Again, no choice on Disc 2 for natural sounds, so this is the option if you just want aquariums with nice music, and they rotate through I think the other 4-5 aquariums on this one. Loop-de-loop.

NOTE1:  MUSIC? (Disc 2 especially since it has not option but music only).  I personally like Led Zepplin, Enya and Zen, so for me, this music was really well done.  Not nuts, not new-age, certainly not rock&roll, but just that nice soothing sound.  To be specific, #1 sound: Guitar with back-piano.  Guitar is very soothing quieter than piano, (I play both, btw), ...and that's what they choose, guitar and piano accompanies.  One or two of the many options add a flute to the main mix.  All in all, very apropos.

FYI: The psychedelic one had MUSIC completely different than ALL others, again, quite apropos and great for cleaning house, aerobics, or other such like.

NOTE2:  For reviews I've seen here and elsewhere about these types of products, I wonder!  People say, oh, I could see the loop, OH, they only used 10 minutes and you could see the main firework explosion too often.  I have to suggest that if you are not the type that actually sits and WATCHES these things like a TV show, or a movie, (I still have to LOL again! just cracks me up).... Anyway, if not, then you will appreciate the beauty and serenity you are seeking for your environment.

I have laughed at some reviews and wonder, do they sit and watch these hours as if a movie, or do they use them for backdrop and ambiance while reading a book, cooking, knitting, or entertaining - surely you all are not just sitting around watching something like this????  Personally I work at home - my TV within view of my office, I often use subliminal CDs but they have no visual, so I bought about $30 of these things so I could change it up.

If you (like I do) want BACKGROUND, sometimes music, sometimes natural sounds, and a visual that when I pass by or look up - there it is!  BEAUTIFUL.

Sorry, have seen so many reviews, just purchased 7 of these type DVDs, and I must say - this is a WINNER, like C. Pierce - Fantastic Value 2 CD's lots of environments and choices. You really can't go wrong if you know what you like/want, and what these things are.",1320796800,,4691,4.458823529411765
8203884,4,B000S1L3WU,"Liked this relaxation video, my cat loved the fish and tried to catch them through the screen.",1242950400,,94,4.588235294117647
8203885,1,B000S1L3WU,"I was so sorry I gave this as a gift.  I was looking for an inexpensive ""fireplace"" type video, and thought this fit the bill.  Ugh, it's 15 different scenes of garbage.  I could shoot a better ""Atlantic Ocean"" loop by driving down the shore on a cloudy day.  ""Gulf of Mexico"" looks like the same beach at a different angle.  ""Sunset"" is lame, although it's fun to watch in fast forward and see the distracting boats and birds whiz by. All the fish tanks look like someone filmed them in a pet store. ""Fireworks"" was entertaining, but too short, as the finale kept happening over and over. The River looks like a still photo that someone animated using the ripple effect.  The ""best"" one is Psychedelic, sure to induce seizures and/or laughter with it's awful colors and even worse music.  I think I ruined Christmas for the unlucky soul I bought this for - they didn't bother trying to regift it, they gave it right back!",1230422400,,922,4.485029940119761
8203886,4,B000S1L3WU,"This is pretty soothing. The music is a bit outdated, but you don't have to listen to it. Nice product.",1204934400,2,103,4.2
8203887,4,B000S1L3WU,"This is a 2 DVD set, and each DVD has lots of options.  There are several aquarium scenes, 2 ocean scenes, a psychadelic scene, 2 fireplaces, a river, fireworks.  They're all well done (although I could personally do without the psychadelic stuff).  The scene you choose will loop over and over so you can watch one as long as you want.

The reason I gave this only 4 stars is that in most of the scenes I found the music annoying and you can't turn the sound off on the 2nd disc.  Muting is ok, but I like to be able to hear the water rushing and the natural sounds that are in the scene.

All that said, I would recommend spending the money just for disc 1.",1204675200,5,659,4.109375
8203888,5,B000S1L3WU,"This is the greatest value! 2 cd's with different environments. Disc 1 contains aquarium, fireworks, rivers, clouds, gulf of mexico, atlantic ocean, sunset, fireplace, & psychedelic, all with the natural sounds of the particular environment plus music. The fireworks selection has all the sounds of being at a fireworks show, including some background crowd sounds. The music can be turned off so you can enjoy the natural sounds of the river flowing, waves crashing on shore, etc. But the ""psychedelic"" environment plays music even with the ""turn music off"" selected, but if you like the mind-bending visuals, you'll probably like the music playing, as well. Disc 2 has 6 fish environments, all with natural water sounds & that music I mentioned above, and 1 fireplace selection with crackling fire sounds only. There's also a photo slide show selection and a ""loop all fish"" button which gives you all the moving fish environments and music. On disc 2, if you don't want to hear the sometimes annoying music, you'll have to mute your TV because there's no ""turn off music"" option, which means you also miss the water sounds. On both discs, each ""environment"" loops automatically. Or you can use the ""skip"" button on your remote to go to the next environment, or go back to the menu/play list to select.

The audio and video quality is excellent. The music is okay, but that's pretty individual, depending on your taste. You can't go wrong for under $8. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised!",1193356800,13,1494,4.928571428571429
