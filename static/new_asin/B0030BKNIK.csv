4043069,4,B0030BKNIK,"I was browsing my local library's foreign movie section the other day and fell upon this French movie. Didn't know much about it but was intruiged enough to pick it up.

""Shall We Kiss?"" (""Un Baiser S'il Vous Plait""; 102 min., originally released in France in 2008, finally released in the US in 2010) brings several stories within a story. Gabriel meets Emilie by chance when she is on a business trip in Nantes, and they hit it off immediately. Gabriel wants to kiss Emilie upon their farewell, but Emilie refuses, for reasons she explains in a flashback of another couple's story, her friend Judith and her husband, and Judith's eventual romantic involvement with her best friend Nicolas. There is one final twist towards the very end, which I won't give away here (you'll just have to see it for yourself). Remember, this is a French movie, and hence a lot of talking for talking's sake.

I enjoyed this movie, but was not blown away by it. The best for me was the lovely performance of Virginie Ledoyen, in the role of Judith. Interesting also is that Emmanuel Mouret, who plays the role of Nicolas, directed this movie. In all, pleasant, but certainly not essential viewing.",1304726400,2,1180,4.723300970873787
4043070,5,B0030BKNIK,"Shall We Kiss is a charming exploration of desire and attraction. I wouldn't call it a romantic comedy, more a quirky lighthearted drama about relationships. The pace is slow and there is a lot of dialogue, but the film is never boring; on the contrary, the terrific acting makes the chemistry between the characters very believable and compelling. The plot intertwines the changing relationship between a man and his married female friend and other women in his life, and an encounter between strangers. The characters exhibit a lot of tenderness and vulnerability. The classical score adds warmth and charm to the often awkward encounters between the characters.
It isn't clear from the item description if only dubbed English audio is available, or if the DVD also has the original French audio with subtitles.",1297296000,4,813,5.120300751879699
4043071,4,B0030BKNIK,"I watched this movie (in French, subtitles) not so much for the story but to catch up on French cinema as practiced these days and get a feeling for contemporary French society, or at least a slice thereof. This is a delightful bedroom farce in the tradition of Moliere, but brought up to date with attractive people of the young professional middle class. All are employed (pharmacists, teachers, etc.), all calm, all well behaved, and all thoroughly bourgeois as they gently get one another in a lot of trouble. Fun and sweet. Also a meditation on the universal tendency for both men and woman to be less than monogamous. A great date movie if there's someone you want to kiss.",1292544000,,679,4.666666666666667
4043072,3,B0030BKNIK,"In this movie, Emilie meets Gabriel on a business trip. They are obviously attracted and spend a pleasant evening talking. Saying goodbye, Gabriel asks for a kiss. Emilie refuses -- and says she has a reason. She knows what one simple kiss can lead to. She proceeds to tell the story of her friends, Nicolas and Judith.

Judith is apparently happily married, Nicolas is her best friend. His girlfriend has left him and he craves physical affection. Can Judith help him out, scratch his itch, as it were? Of course she can. The two proceed to embark on the weirdest love scene I've seen in some time. ""May I touch your left breast?"" asks Nicolas. ""Help yourself,"" replies Judith (or words to that effect). ""And your right breast?"" ""Be my guest."" Never have a couple spoken to each other so much, and so politely, while making love. Eventually it boils down to a kiss -- and abracadabra, magic ensues.

Now Judith has a problem. Making love to Nicolas is an itch she can't stop scratching. They try to do it badly, mechanically, without feeling. It makes no difference. It's still fantastic.

We follow these absurd people and their absurd dilemma with amusement, noting that this kind of movie could only happen in France and in French. I never lost interest -- and yet never got too invested in the characters and their endless talk.

C'est tres amusanat, assez drole -- and a little silly.",1281830400,11,1390,4.684426229508197
4043073,4,B0030BKNIK,"As an American who is always trying to improve her French language skills, I watch at least one French film each week (Thanks to TV5). Unfortunately, the majority of them are depressing and far too bent on ""realism"" to be enjoyable for most Americans. This film, however, is a delight and rates right up there with ""Bienvenue Chez les Ch'tis,"" ""Amlie,"" ""Hors de Prix,"" ""Antony Zimmer,"" ""Dcalage Horaire,"" ""Venus Beaut,"" or ""A La Folie...Pas Du Tout."" Witty, tender, and believable, this is a truly enjoyable film in any language.",1280448000,4,529,4.955056179775281
4043074,4,B0030BKNIK,"I rented this movie not really knowing what to expect, and not really expecting much.  Foreign movies that do make it onto a video store shelf do tend to be of a good quality.

Set in Nantes, a man randomly meets a woman looking for directions to a taxi, attractive, elegant, desirable as a French woman can be.  He walks away but then changes his mind, and offers her a ride.  She is in town for only a day, and lives far away. When they arrive at her hotel, he says goodbye and then turns to walk away, and again changes his mind.

They engage, and have a stimulating encounter in a restaurant, and the parallel story of why they can't engage further emerges, and I must admit this story had me hooked all the way through, and you wonder what will happen right to the end, as the fate of one story hangs on the other. I love that element of unpredictability, and as the movie progresses you become progressively more intrigued by these characters.

This is definitely one of the more interesting foreign movies I have seen.  The 4 beautiful French actresses are amazing, and give great elegant and poised performances. I hope you find this review helpful. Go ahead and watch it.  I think you will love it, and I am still thinking about this movie days later. Subtitled.",1271289600,19,1271,4.448275862068965
4043075,4,B0030BKNIK,"""Shall We Kiss?"" is a curiosity, and a very watchable one. It seems like a chatty, elegant French romantic comedy-Eric Rohmer Lite, perhaps, or sexier Woody Allen-until it takes an apparant turn for the melodramatic. Behind the melodrama, though, is a further layer of subversive parody, and behind that is a real knowledge of the power of desire.  Yet the whole thing's weightless: An upscale date-movie bonbon that keeps yielding pungent aftertastes.",1264032000,10,452,5.277777777777778
4043076,3,B0030BKNIK,"I didn't love this, but it killed part of a 9 hour flight and was interesting enough that I didn't switch to something else, so it's not the worst film out there. None of the characters are particularly compelling.",1402617600,,214,4.512820512820513
4043077,1,B0030BKNIK,"Your average Romcom but from a French perspective. I can't say it was a waste of time but it surely wasn't a productive use of time. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have time to kill, or are into the whole Romcom theme.",1380240000,,222,4.186046511627907

4043079,5,B0030BKNIK,"Shall We Kiss? ranks in the top tier of contemporary French comedies along with comic hits of the director and writer Francis Veber like The Dinner Game, The Closet and The Valet, which have won numerous awards.  This film's principal protagonist, Virginie Ledoyen, is one of France's most talented actresses (she began her ""career"" at the age of two) and has become a delightful screen presence.  (She also appeared recently opposite Gerard Depardieu in the French farce, Bon Voyage.)  Shall We Kiss? is a most amusing story that will appeal to young and old alike.  It's a memorable comic tale of the Human Condition.

4043080,5,B0030BKNIK,"This is a film that could only be made in France.  If you love French style and humor you'll love this; otherwise probably don't bother.  It's talky, it's a little philosophical and it's done with great wit and taste.  The story involves a chance meeting between a man and a woman in Nantes, both of whom are involved with other partners.  They are strongly attracted to each other though, and end up spending an evening together talking.  When he asks for a kiss, in a very polite way, she refuses him and then, when pressed, tells him why.  This involves the story of two of her friends, Judith and Nicholas, whose friendship was sorely taxed when she gives him an innocent kiss.

I won't spoil the fun for you. It's a clever story and will hold your interest until the very end.  (I loved the end!)  It's a beautifully constructed film, visually.  I loved the costumes....everyone wore shades of white, ivory or, in the end, brown.  Nicholas' Burberry plaid scarf was repeated, briefly, in the lining of Judith's husband's raincoat.  The art on the walls was very interesting, especially a large photograph of Schubert.  In one scene Nicholas is standing next to the photo and they look amazingly similar.  There is wonderful classical music throughout, Schubert and others.  The cast is first rate.

The translation of the title is unfortunate, as is the picture on the DVD cover.  They both suggest that this is a cheap little comedy.  It is much more than that.  I can't think of a better title...maybe just ""the Kiss"" because it surely shows the power of a kiss.",1351728000,,1569,4.681318681318682
4043081,5,B0030BKNIK,"If you read Candide, you remember Pangloss' contorted reasoning and idiotic explanations. I have refused to see this movie because of the stupid title (""Shall We Kiss""), which by the way is more like ""A kiss, please!"" in French. A much more provocative and accurate title would have been ""Playing with Fire,"" which is the subject of this gem of a film, looking beyond marriage for love.

  Now back to Dr. Pangloss... If you know the French, they discuss philosophy and phenomenology endlessly, and they are so polite (until they turn and insult you). So this lovely film is a pastiche of how the French intellectualize everything. The quartet of actors is top-notch and endlessly amusing, and the script is brilliant. Enjoy the quiet laughter - this is a masterpiece... best thing to come out of France in years. If you don't believe me, see it on Amazon Prime first. Enjoy!

  BTW, if you liked this you will have a GRAND time watching the adorable and hilarious Audrey Tautou in one of the funniest comedies I can remember - Priceless. It keeps getting funnier and you won't succeed in suppressing your laughter, which will get loud at times. She has no job and goes cruising for elderly rich men until she bumps into a hotel worker who pretends to be  well-heeled. To keep up the deception, he is forced to deplete his IRA! Hahaha!",1325289600,3,1335,4.67948717948718
4043082,5,B0030BKNIK,This movie is a little arty and because it's French it's in subtitles but it's a great movie. If you don't like reading subtitles or if you don't like movies that are a little outside of the box than you wouldn't like this movie. It gets a little steamy in some parts but for the most part it's extremely romantic and very funny.,1325116800,,329,4.238095238095238
