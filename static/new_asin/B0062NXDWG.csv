8491283,4,B0062NXDWG,"A charming, fun, if slightly lightweight and repetitive documentary on the performance artist Andrew Logan and his brain-child The Alternative Miss World Pageant.  Attracting all ages, sexual orientations along with some amazing artists taking part as judges (Brian Eno, Derek Jarman) its a gleeful warm celebration of non-conformity, and challenging the status quo, while having a lot of laughs, and encouraging some real creativity in personal presentations.  From a 78 year old Russian, to a robot, this is a Beauty Pageant as a chance to tweak the mainstream about just what we consider beautiful in the first place.  Certainly it will put a smile on your face, but by the end just seeing highlights of various annual pageants was starting to wear off.  I was interested in knowing more of the thought behind the laughs.",1452729600,,824,5.0814814814814815
8491284,5,B0062NXDWG,"This documentary follows The Alternative Miss World Competition from its meager beginings in 1972 to the spectacle that it has become in 2009. It is highly entertaining, and if you are a fan of alternative culture, then you will love it.

I'm a little biased, because my sister, Veronica, was one of the contestants in 2009, but it really is a great movie.

Watch for Brian Eno's cat, because he'll be watching you!",1339372800,,415,4.671232876712328
