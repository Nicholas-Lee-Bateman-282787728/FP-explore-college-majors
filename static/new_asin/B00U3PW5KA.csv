After seeing the beautiful Yvonne De Carlo in the movie 'The Desert Hawk' I became an instant fan of this beautiful star.  I remember seeing 'Hotel Sahara' advertised at a local Cinema in London, England,  I always assumed it was similar to 'The Desert Hawk' and would be a color movie.  'Hotel Sahara' is a black and white movie and is really a comedy !,  for me it was a big disappointment.  The only thing that makes it watchable for me is that it stars YVONNE DE CARLO.",1464912000,,544,4.233009708737864
