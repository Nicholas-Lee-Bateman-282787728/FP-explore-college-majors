8293391,5,B001DHM19C,Clear and to the point. What it shows it shows well.,1517443200,,52,3.8181818181818183
8293392,4,B001DHM19C,I would have liked more examples of the actual mold making and casting process. Another source of information (such as a basic sand casting book) is necessary to understand the DVD.,1393113600,,181,4.870967741935484
8293393,5,B001DHM19C,This is a visual testament to Daves work and does a good job showing the furnace after it was fixed and how he makes a form from begining to finish. Wish he had shown how to build the furnace too. He shows off some of his other machines instead.,1316304000,,245,4.020408163265306
8293394,5,B001DHM19C,"This is, without a doubt, the best and most entertaining video on sand casting there is. The information is presented in a concise, straight foward, and yet relaxed manor. If you have ever read any of Dave's books you'll understand what I mean. There is a little tom foolery,but it is a delight to watch. I think you will learn more with this video than you could reading ten books, by other writers.",1284163200,2,400,4.493150684931507
