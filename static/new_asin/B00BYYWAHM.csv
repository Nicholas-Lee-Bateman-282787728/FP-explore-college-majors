5683007,1,B00BYYWAHM,"I have many problems with this movie so ill just make a list
Acting- horrible
Music- soap opera like
Plot- has absolutely nothing to do with ninjas. In this hour and a half turd there is not even a single scene with a ninja in it. It is just a straight up Chinese Kung Fu movie and at he end of the movie the main bad guy is wearing a white gi with Tae Kwon Do written across the back.",1371340800,,385,3.825
5683008,2,B00BYYWAHM,Overly drawn out fight scenes. Has nothing to do with ninja masters. As a Sho Kosugi fan I expected more from his son.,1371168000,5,118,4.173913043478261
5683009,2,B00BYYWAHM,"Both, the title and the art cover of this movie are misleading - there are no ninjas, those are not even mentioned anywhere or seen (perhaps like true ninjas, there were super invisible, all the time).

The impression from the movie is so so. The plot is dull as hundred thousands of other action movies united with the same primitive plot (will not spoil your view, as you are supposed to reveal what-is-going-on after the first 50 minutes, though everything will be already clear after the first 10 minutes - it is that badly directed).

Fights are mediocre, as hands and legs will be moved in the air most of the time hardly touching anything around with everyone somehow seriously injured.

I put 2 stars instead of 1 because the lady that fights there - Luxia Jiang, is one of the most talented female martial artists of our time. It's just too bad, the movie she is in - got bad action choreography, bad acting, bad plot, bad title - bad everything.

5683010,1,B00BYYWAHM,This movie was terrible. I couldn't get passed the Asian guy playing a girl. Wtf was that all about? I stop it not even two min in the movie. Stupidest movie ever created. The writers and directors should be ashamed of the movie. Here's their dumbest movie reward.... Lame as f$&@.,1391990400,,281,4.529411764705882
5683011,2,B00BYYWAHM,"This movie does not match the cover of the cover art, though it was not a bad movie, but the content has nothing to do with NINJA MASTERS, therefore the owner of this deceit me.",1389052800,,177,4.085714285714285
5683012,3,B00BYYWAHM,Lofts of fighting but expected higher skill level from Kane Kosugi. It could have been the way the story was written which was not strong either. The female star (I don't know her name) was pretty good but just did not make feel that I want to see her again.,1381622400,,258,4.18
5683013,1,B00BYYWAHM,"it really sucked, had no story line and was very boring.it made me want to fall asleep it couldn't keep my attention.",1376352000,,117,4.363636363636363
5683014,1,B00BYYWAHM,"Has nothing to do with the Japanese or ninja.
There is not a single ninja in this film nor is one even mentioned.
It is about an underground martial arts fighting ring.
It is all subtitles as well.",1376179200,,197,4.2105263157894735
5683015,1,B00BYYWAHM,I love ninja movies but this wost film I have ever seen in my life. wish I could have given it 0 stars so do your self a faver don't waste the $14:oo on it. If you want thow money away just throw it in the air and maybe someone will pick it up and use it.,1376006400,,255,3.491228070175439
5683016,3,B00BYYWAHM,Mi expected to see ninjas if the movie is named ninja masters but there wasn't one ninja in it let alone a mention of any ninjas .. I would think if you had a ninja on the cover and the title said such it would be about them.. Dissapointed about that but the movie was ok none the less.. I don't think I would have purchased it if I knew it wasn't really about ninjas at all..,1373328000,4,376,3.896103896103896
5683017,3,B00BYYWAHM,"There are no ninjas in this film. I suppose that the U.S. distributor saw the name ""Kosug"" and decided to go for fans of his father, which is a pity. The film is actually a straight martial arts cheapie, filmed with available architecture (instead of expensive sets) and with minimal plot of the ""lured into underground fighting"" type. On that basis, it isn't too bad. About on the level of KARATE GIRL or THE KICK, say. I'm not sorry that I bought it, I just wish that Lions Gate had been more honest about the content.",1372464000,5,520,4.427083333333333
5683018,2,B00BYYWAHM,"Rented it for the Grandchildren and they loved it.  Not to worry about the subtitles there is not much story to follow, just a lot of ""POW's and WAMB's""",1371859200,,152,4.241379310344827
5683019,1,B00BYYWAHM,This DVD is a waste. There is no ninja in even one scene. Please refrain from buying this DVD. Story is boring...only thing its good for is falling asleep while watching it. Kane Kosugi you have ended your career with this exploit of the word Ninja. Again don't waste your money on this DVD.,1371600000,3,291,4.407407407407407

8575744,1,B00BYYWAHM,"The title is very misleading.

This movie is not about ninjas.  This movie features zero ninjas.  And the movie itself is pretty bad, even after you get used to the idea that it is not a ninja movie.",1395100800,,199,4.184210526315789
8575745,3,B00BYYWAHM,"This movie is totally mis-leading.  There are no ninjas, no mention of ninjas and not even a ninja turtle.  Movie is ok, the female lead is very good at fighting but I have seen better. To me this is another brand of false advertising.",1393200000,,235,4.318181818181818
8575746,5,B00BYYWAHM,This Movie Was Off The Hook Really Enjoyed It Alot especially Seeing That It Had Kane Kosugi In It. Really Loved His Father Movies So Glad To See That He Followed In His Footsteps.,1392595200,3,180,4.323529411764706
