2468616,2,B000CPKAXU,I had high hopes for this DVD but was very disappointed with the quality. It's like an amateur video. A lot of it goes from scene to scene very quickly. When you see some of the characters from the past you only see them for a second or two only. The sound is bad and a lot of times goes way up then way down. It was nice to see the  past characters and scenes from the beginning of the show up to 2002 but was hard to enjoy with the poor quality. It could have been done much better. I sure expected better from Biography.,1318032000,13,523,3.9339622641509435
2468617,3,B000CPKAXU,"I'm a longtime fan of All My Children and bought this tape thinking I would get an overview of this fabulous soap, but instead too much time was spent talking about the production of the soap by producers and people behind the scenes that we don't care about.  I wouldn't have bought this if I had known it wouldn't be strickly about Erica, Adam, Tad, Brooke, Phoebe, Myrtle, Mona and the rest of these old beloved characters.  Not interested in how the show is made, just wanted more of the show itself.",1275177600,2,504,4.467391304347826

2468619,5,B000CPKAXU,"If you an AMC fan new or old this DVD is great. It shows have the show is filmed, but writing to, building the set's to shoots, to getting it edited. It also shows clips from the shows history. I loved it!",1153612800,39,205,3.9047619047619047

While it didn't take the place of my show, I was able to hold on to a piece of my heart with this DVD.  Great memories!  Welcome back All My Children.

8100141,4,B000CPKAXU,This biography shows more how the show was staged on production rather than showing any episodes.  If you are looking for story material then this DVD isn't for you,1344470400,2,164,4.655172413793103
