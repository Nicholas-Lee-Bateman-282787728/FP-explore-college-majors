3889851,5,B002AMVEEM,"This classic family sitcom really hit its stride in the second season.  While it is hard to pick individual episodes that shone a little brighter than all the stars in this collection, I do have a few favorites.  In ""The Bachelor"" Jim's relationship advice for Dana works a little too well... on national televsion.  ""Wonder Woman"" is a very funny episode about Cheryl kicking some serious butt, which comes home with some very serious discussion from Jim about what Cheryl means to him.  But clearly the tour de force for this season is the two part 'You Gotta Love Somebody"" cycle.  Dan Akroyd returns to the series and is joined by fellow SNL original cast member Laraine Newman.  Not only is it a funny story, it features some hot muscial sequences with Jim and Danny.",1273017600,6,772,4.681481481481481

The Packaging isn't so hot, the discs don't stay in place well at all and you risk getting them scratched every time you open it up.
The package I got actually had some pits in the plastic that are on the play side of the disc. If they were to touch the disc.you can say goodbye to that disc.

3889916,3,B002AMVEEM,"I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and heavily. But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred. After a Cubs game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow. Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state? ""Nuts to that"", I said. So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me.

What Fate had in store was an episode of this show, an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad, general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with, and once again I was completely right! This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn.

The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-ish to elicit any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell.

Except..

Except for the wonderful comic stylings of Larry Joe Campbell, America's Greatest Comic Character Actor. This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he is gold. How good is he really? Well, aside from being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. That's like trying to make butt warts look good. But Campbell pulls it off with style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne-Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the ""litter"" on the floor of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he's in!",1355875200,,2083,4.546666666666667

3889918,5,B002AMVEEM,"This show is superbly written and delivered with an outstanding cast.  Every episode feels like a funny version of the problems I face on a day to day basis.
