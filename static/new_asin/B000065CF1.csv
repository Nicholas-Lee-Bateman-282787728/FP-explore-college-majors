1707214,4,B000065CF1,"This is a great jumpstart into understanding *some* of the possibilities of armature puppet animation. The corny but clear host describes a method for creating tie-down wire armature puppets with various types of Sculpey, including the new ""bake and bend"" kind. I especially liked the tip about using coupling nuts for feet. But be warned, this method is expensive, requires trips to specialty stores and not all of his materials are non-toxic like Sculpey. The culprit is plumber's epoxy putty, which I'll admit is an amazing product for armatures when used safely. I recommend this video as an educational portion of a ""healthy breakfast"" of stop-motion animation research. Just don't make it the only thing you study. And remember you can get started with simpler techniques.",1126310400,8,778,5.182539682539683

7960938,3,B000065CF1,"Interesting Primer on basic sculpting,using ""Sculpy"" clay. I have had a bar of this clay for about a year now,and after watching this,I think its time to give it a go!
Wished he talked more about the baking process and stop animation,perhaps in the next video.
