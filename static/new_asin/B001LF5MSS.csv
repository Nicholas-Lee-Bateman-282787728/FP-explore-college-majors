8402091,3,B001LF5MSS,"The description of the video--""John Milton's Paradise Lost performed by John Basinger""--caused me to believe that different people would be reciting
the lines of the epic:  that is, we would hear Adam and Eve and Raphael and Michael and Satan and the fallen angels.  However, the production is really a recording of John Basinger reading the epic Paradise Lost.  I had intended to show the film to my class, but will not do so.",1346457600,,427,4.743243243243243
