While this series has yet to really impress with anything it's shown so far, the fact that it's so willing to challenge its audience to think about new things and use such excruciating detail to make their stories flow it makes me curious to know what they are going to do with the second half of the series. This one isn't for the weak willed but if you're feeling up to the challenge, this series just might provide you with something worthwhile in the end.",1213920000,,594,4.36036036036036
