The footage from the Blues in the F-4 Phantom was excellent & shows that they really work hard flying those aircraft. There are 2 films when the Blues flew A-4 Skyhawk from 1974 to 1978. These 2 films brought back a lot of memories for me & my father. My father was the Maintenance Chief for the Blues during that time(1975-1978). He recognized several pilots & support crew from the films. It's really hard to find this kind of footage of the Blue Angels anywhere, especially on DVD. It is well worth the price to relive these memories. As a son of a Blue Angel I want to say ""Thank You"" for keeping these memories alive for me.",1384300800,,772,4.368055555555555
