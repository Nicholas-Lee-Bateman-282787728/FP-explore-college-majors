8521660,5,B007SNC532,"These are excellent videos.  Publications by the same author reinforce the value of these videos. They will be of great value to the practitioners of several arts, Aikido,  Hapkido, Taijutsu, Jujutsu, unarmed Filipino MA, Daito-ryu and others.  The techniques are presented in a very clear manner by Saito Sensei which makes it very easy to follow each technique and its fine points.  For the Aikido newcomer and those starting other arts it offers details which may have been missed or not shown in class.  For the advanced Aikido practitioner an excellent presentation which provides valuable  insight into many techniques.  For those practicing similar or nearly identical techniques in other this is an excellent insight into different ways of performing their techniques and will be of value to both beginners and advanced.  These 7 seminars are well worth the time to view as an additional training aid.  For me, these have provided additional insights to add to  my training in Hapkido, Jujutsu, Daito-ryu and FMA.  Highly recommended.",1445990400,,1042,5.216867469879518
