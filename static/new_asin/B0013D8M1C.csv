The character development was  well done.  I have  shown THIS  movie to a bunch of  my  friends,  and  they all really enjoyed seeing Anthony Michael Hall ( 80's fame )  and  William Ragsdell  ( Fright Night )....
  I loved this  movie......",1461628800,,395,4.796875

But I was extremely pleasantly surprised to thoroughly enjoy the entire film and all the performances. All the actors have wonderful chemistry together and the story will draw you in right from the beginning. I think both men and women will enjoy this film, even though the premise sounds like a ""guys"" movie. It's a character film, no action or blood and guts, but it's very down to earth and has charming and quirky characters you will love to spend 2 hours with. I highly recommend it.",1412640000,,571,4.663366336633663
8249999,5,B0013D8M1C,"OMG!!  If you want to laugh out loud and just have a great time, watch this movie.  Its about six guys who hang out in a bar that are dealing with serious real life issues.  This movie was so much fun to watch, I just couldn't stop watching it.  I highly recommend buying it.  I have to be honest, I am a huge Michael Hall fan and only wanted to see him, but when I started watching really focusing on the other actors, they were just magical together and made a great team.

I'm glad I invested in buying it.",1319673600,2,509,4.04

Very well written and acted.  You have to see it!!!",1211846400,6,260,4.244897959183674
8250001,5,B0013D8M1C,"Just loved this movie. Watched as soon as it came in. I'm a huge Anthony Michael Hall fan which was the reason to pre-order it.

The movie didn't disappoint me. Great cast, great dialogue. It's a movie about 6 guys so I thought me being a woman might find it a bit out of my league, but really I loved it from beginning to end and it had me really guessing all through the movie who the person would be that shot himself at the beginning of the movie.

And as a AMH fan to just concentrate on him for a bit. He was just great. It was wonderful to see his character change during the movie, starting as a selfish cold-hearted prick into a lovable guy at the end of the movie, finding the love of his life in an unexpected corner.

Buy this movie, you won't regret it.",1209513600,10,766,4.093333333333334
