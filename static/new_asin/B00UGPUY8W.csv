7037979,4,B00UGPUY8W,"I grew up a Green Bay Packer fan so I would like this DVD better than fans of other teams. A better DVD would be Small Potatoes, Who killed the USFL?",1385856000,,149,3.838709677419355
7037980,3,B00UGPUY8W,"I enjoyed the Green Bay Packers Heroes documentary but I felt like it was missing something. It talks about 15 Packers greats but I feel like a lot were forgotten about. The documentary is only about and hour and 20 minutes long and is the only thing on disc 1. On disc 2, the only thing is Greatest Games: Favre to Sharpe (1993 Wildcard Game). That is only an hour and 10 minutes long. I feel like they could've put all that on one disc or maybe had more footage. There are no special features at all. A lot of the footage used is footage from other NFL Films documentaries so if you've seen those you may see the same footage that you've already seen before.",1367193600,,660,4.246031746031746

7037982,5,B00UGPUY8W,I love this dvd.  One minor thing.  I wish they would've covered John Brockington.. That's it.  I loved it!,1263254400,3,107,4.526315789473684
7037983,3,B00UGPUY8W,"I'll get right to it.  How could there ever be a retrospective of the '60s Packers with no mention at all of Herb Adderley and Willie Wood? They were two of the most important players on those championship defenses.  Also, if I were someone who hadn't occasionally watched this team in the '80s, I would have thought James Lofton, John Jefferson, and Lynn Dickey never existed.  I know the Packers weren't very good then, but doesn't at least Lofton -- a Hall of Famer -- deserve ""hero"" status? I figured there would be extensive footage dedicated to Brett Favre, but the history which preceded him by only a decade or so should have been included, as well.  The true saving grace for me is the bonus disc, which features the ""NFL's Greatest Games: 1993 NFC Wild Card Game (aka 'Favre to Sharpe').""  I saw it on ESPN a few years ago and enjoyed it quite a bit.",1257033600,12,860,4.452229299363057
