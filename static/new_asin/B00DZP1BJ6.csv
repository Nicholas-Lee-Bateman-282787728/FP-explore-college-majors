5880274,1,B00DZP1BJ6,"Why does he continue to make such crappie Halloween and Christmas specials ? I began hateing Disney with a passion when they cancelled Power Rangers instead of making the next season ( Samurai ) during its reselling to Saban . But now , it's between Saban and Nickelodeon . 20-22 episodes per season on Nickelodeon , an even dumber dumded down storyline , so called Super Seasons , a crappie 45 minute so-called movie ( clash of the Red rangers ) and those stupid motorcycles in the toyline since Mighty Morphin 2010 . Somehow , I believe that Cartoon Network can do a better job than the Saban of today  ; in other words , that idiot Saban should sell the series to C.N. at once man .",1405382400,,685,4.3515625
5880275,5,B00DZP1BJ6,"This is an excellent episode where the rangers are stuck in the zord after a battle and they remember different things that have happened to them since becoming rangers.  Also their master entertains Bulk and Spike while waiting on the rangers to return from their battle.  Bulk and Spike help Ji decorate the tree.  I especially liked the bonus Christmas episode from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ""Alpha's Magical Christmas and the another bonus episode from Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ""Forever Friends.""  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Power Rangers.",1402704000,2,566,5.186813186813187
