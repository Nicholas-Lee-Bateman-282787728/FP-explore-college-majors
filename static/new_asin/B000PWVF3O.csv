8193639,3,B000PWVF3O,Most of it was trivial. I liked the use of two professors.,1488844800,,58,3.9166666666666665
8193640,4,B000PWVF3O,"The information in these is wonderful, fun, and simple to understand.  There is however a real problem with the energy,  which makes it hard to watch for very long at one sitting.  The energy is similar to a commercial for Oxi Clean.  If the presenters were relaxed and in less of a 'selling' tone it would be a joy to watch and learn.  Truly they are brilliant in their choice of content and order.of material, just too much like listening to TV commercials.",1426809600,,459,4.481927710843373
8193641,4,B000PWVF3O,"When I previewed this set of DVDs from the Teaching Co., I instantly thought of my grandchildren ages 15, 11, and 8. The concepts are well demonstrated. All math is about counting, shapes , or predictions. The Fibanacci part was especially interesting to the children as well as Pathagorian numbers. The first half hour DVD is a bit wordy and the children were impatient with their telling of what they were going to present. The second and third DVDs held their attention. This is a learning series for adults, but it had value for the children when I gave it to them on my recent visit.",1341792000,,588,4.556603773584905
8193642,3,B000PWVF3O,"I got these along with some others on mathematics to see if it could help me understand some of the more arcane aspects of the subject well enough for me to improve my grasp of calculus.  While I enjoyed the series of lectures, and they certainly gave me a new understanding of how mathematics is used and how it developed over time, I'm not too sure that it made me any more fit to tackle more difficult math in the future.  The series is more a form of entertainment than a method of learning useful mathematics.

The course is, like the astronomy series which I also own, a series of classroom style lectures.  There are handmade demonstrations which help elucidate the concepts of the course--my favorite being the rabbits to demonstrate probability--and ""overheads"" or ""powerpoints"" to illustrate equations.  This is not heavily into CGI; think classroom not Discovery Channel.

The course is team taught, as was popular in the late 80s and 90s--I've no idea if this is still popular in the classroom now, having been away from it since the mid-90s.  Each instructor presents a portion of the material relevant to his own specialty and probably to his own skill at putting across difficult concepts in a given subarea of mathematics.  This has a positive side in that attention and interest are more likely to be engaged with novelty and that different people learn through different approaches.  It has a negative side in that one may have gained a mental rapport with one of the instructors and his style only to discover one needs to readjust ones thinking to accommodate the other one.  Especially with math, which most of us find a little difficult, this can pose a major obstacle.

I think the lectures are probably better for those with at least a little understanding of math to begin with but who want to enjoy it as an ""art"" rather than as a ""tool.""  Knowing the philosophy of numbers and their uses, especially as a human invention and a mental construct is certainly interesting.  Seeing the degree to which math also has connections with art is also illuminating. Though a pain for most of us, however, the old textbook and lecture method is still probably the best way of actually learning when and where to use math for practical problem solving.",1286496000,3,2266,4.75
