8092474,3,B000BTITY4,"This film begins with a cursory description of battered women and the choices they make. This is followed by a brutal attack on a woman, who is sleeping alone in her own bed. She flees the house, only to return. It is not until the following morning that we discover the attack was perpetrated by her husband, and that he has been attacking her in a similar manner for some time. He is an otherwise wealthy, respectable citizen and she works as a professional model, which creates an ostensible disconnect for the viewer. So, spousal abuse can occur among any socio-economic class; point taken. She eventually moves out, the two fight over custody of their young son and the viewer falls asleep. Aside from the occasional swear word or glimpse of nudity, there isn't much here to distinguish this turgid melodrama from countless other made-for-TV films. Every man is a drunkard, a philanderer, an abuser or all of the above; how original...  Perhaps the best reason to see this film, at least for yours truly, is to see a fairly early starring role for Sarah Douglas. The beautiful Ms. Douglas, who is probably best known for her role as Ursa in the ""Superman"" movies, turns in a very good performance as the battered wife. Here she looks and sounds strikingly similar to Gina Bellman (of ""Coupling"" and ""Blackeyes"" fame), which I mean in the most flattering sense possible. Playing the batterer is Julian Glover, who is probably best known to American audiences for his roles in James Bond, Star Wars and Indiana Jones films. Special mention needs to go to Trinity Home Entertainment for its presentation of the DVD. Even though there are no special features, the picture is presented in widescreen format and the picture looks exceptional. This comes as a completely pleasant surprise, given the low price and relative obscurity of the film. Film: 2/5 stars, DVD: 4/5 stars",1194393600,4,1875,4.841121495327103
