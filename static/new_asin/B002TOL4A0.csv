8380372,5,B002TOL4A0,"Like others, this movie revealed to me how much of a fan I should be towards Ann Sheridan. Her chemistry with RR is what makes the movie for me as they flow together perfectly. The story and other characters are just a side show to them frankly. Still, if you like this period of films you won't be disappointed because of their star power, even if the story isn't anything spectacular. If you've not saw it, you need to.",1473206400,,421,4.341772151898734

8380374,4,B002TOL4A0,"The only scene that takes away from this movie is the mob scene.  I thought that the villain in the movie gives up too easily and call me old fashioned but I'd like to see him suffer a little more for what he did and tried to do.  Prior to seeing this movie on TCM, I never really saw Ann Sheridan, but it only took a few minutes to become a fan.  The chemistry between her and Ronald Regan is amazing and fun to watch.  The film reminds me of Woody Guthrie's book Bound For Glory.",1463443200,2,481,3.9791666666666665
