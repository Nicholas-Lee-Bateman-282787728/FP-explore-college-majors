8415288,5,B0043TXJC0,"After trying to find a decent copy in the US and getting only very poor DVDs that were clearly sourced from VHS tapes, I ordered this version from Italy: what a great choice! The Italian version is printed from 35mm film and shows some flaws from the old print, but is sharp and much better than the copies I had bought here in the US. Plus, to me, it was nice to hear the old commentary in Italian. As a bonus, this DVD includes the fully restored US version of the film. The quality is superb! If you are looking for the best version of this classic movie, get this! There is even an old interview with Flaherty's widow.",1360454400,,622,4.235294117647059
