8248806,4,B001320N06,"First off two warnings: this DVD is NOT all region. It must be PAL - I tried it on three DVD players and the only one on which it played was my all-region player. Second off, it does not have English subtitles (nor any subtitles for that matter).
That being said, despite the modern dress production, this is a marvelous work that any lover of baroque opera should get to know. Beautifully sung and realized, the performance is a real treat. If you're not proficient in German (I am not) but are aware of the basic story (grab a handy mythological handbook if you're not) you shouldn't have too hard a time in following what's going on on stage and the rewards, as stated, are plentiful. I hope this review helps anyone who is having a hard time making up their mind to buy this (just make sure you have an all region DVD player before you do - it will also probably play fine on a computer).",1298851200,3,892,4.315476190476191
