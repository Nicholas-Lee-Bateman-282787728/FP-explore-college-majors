2569642,4,B000FJTV9C,"The National Archives supplied the motion-picture elements used in this compilation. According to the container, the titles in the set were ""selected by Specialists at the National Archives."" Here's a list of the set's contents. Except as noted, the elements used in the transfers were in very good condition. The production dates and running times are taken from the container and have not been verified.

VOLUME I:

The Rear Gunner (B/W, 1943, 26 min.) -- Produced by the U.S. Army Air Forces in cooperation with Warner Brothers; featuring Lieutenants Burgess Meredith and Ronald Reagan; directed by Ray Enright. The first few minutes of the film are affected by recurring image washout, which affects the soundtrack as well. The source of the problem is the original print since the soundtrack fade occurs about a second after the picture fade, matching the 20-frame sound advance on 35mm film.

The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress (Technicolor from a 16mm original, 1944, 43 min.) -- Presented by the War Department; distributed by Paramount Pictures; directed by Lieutenant Colonel William Wyler. Worn print, uneven color, with plenty of vertical scratches and cinch marks.

8123772,5,B000FJTV9C,"The air war definitely determined the war in Europe, and to a significant extent the pacific conflict.  Without control of the skies, the allies could not have invaded the european mainland.  The carrier task forces of the pacific war, took the struggle to the japanese, and decimated their carrier forces.  This made the island invasions an easier undertaking for the ground forces.  The second world war also produced some of the best fighter aircraft ever created.  JRV",1366070400,2,472,5.077922077922078
