5124193,4,B0082CE6XK,"This isn't the funniest movie I've ever seen, but I was entertained the whole time and even laughed out loud a couple of times.  The movie had a lot to do with personal growth, so I found it to be somewhat inspirational.  I would definitely recommend it and probably watch it again.",1349481600,,282,4.403846153846154
5124194,3,B0082CE6XK,"You can't really expect it to not be predictable, but it had a lot of funny parts. The ending was way too rushed. An entertaining watch though.",1349481600,,143,4.333333333333333
5124195,3,B0082CE6XK,"This movie is pretty entertaining for the moment (I watched it on my train commute) but its not one of the best movies I've seen recently.

Kate Bosworths character is under-developed in my opinion. She is selfish in the beginning and doesn't grow much throughout the movie.

Overall, it is a unique movie about having to grow up sooner than expected and the main character can be quite relateable at times, for someone in their late 20s who feels the uncertainty about their future/career",1348963200,,489,4.809523809523809
5124196,3,B0082CE6XK,I rented this movie based on the actors and did not know much about the story line.  The plot has a good message and there are some funny parts.  Totally worth renting.,1348963200,,168,4.21875
5124197,1,B0082CE6XK,I expected a Krysten Ritter performance of at least the caliber of her current show. All of the acting felt high school play and the picture quality was the worst I've experienced outside of any movie made before 2005. I was very disappointed overall.,1348272000,2,251,4.7272727272727275
5124198,4,B0082CE6XK,"This was a good movie! It was funny and entertaining and it had a pretty good ending! I would watch it again, but I probably wouldn't buy it, unless it was really cheap! Streaming was excellent though!",1348185600,,201,4.45945945945946
5124199,3,B0082CE6XK,"Cute movie with real issues for the actress playing mom. Entertaining to watch, maybe a tad slow but has a good message.",1348185600,,120,4.5
5124200,3,B0082CE6XK,"Was kind of a mindless comedy. Wasn't anything I'd tell anyone to watch, or memorable. But it was entertaining and passed the time.",1348099200,,131,4.739130434782608
5124201,4,B0082CE6XK,"We are making our way through the gauntlet. We have gone from funny pregnant teenager to funny new born mom. Kim (Krysten Ritter) and Deena (Kate Bosworth) are liberated college women. The next thing we know Kim has a son Max. The pair share a house with Laura (Rachel Bilson) who is proud of her virginity, but accepts jobs that pay well which make you question it. She was a great character for what little time she was on the screen.

Marc (Rhys Coiro) the father of the child is also a surfer which allows him to leave the picture. The film works on the theme that having a baby is a ""buzz kill."" It is worse than the plague. In an early scene they drove the point home so much, it managed to bring the film down to where I didn't think it could recover to be a comedy again. Kristen Johnston plays Kim's flaky boss who is far from understanding.

When Kim meets Nicholas (Geoff Stults) they have an attraction for each other. Kim lies to Nicholas about the baby, claiming it is Deena's, which later resulted in a funny barbed filled double date, the comedy highlight of the film. The plot is predictable and I don't think it would have worked any other way.

Krysten Ritter looked exceedingly pale in this film, as a new born mom, i.e. a mom that just dropped the kid an hour ago. She kept that look for much of the film, perhaps to drive home the point. Justin Kirk plays an educated perv friend of Nicholas. He had a funny character that should have been used more. The film has some laughs and is a worth while date night rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex? no nudity.",1345852800,8,1578,4.338983050847458
5124202,4,B0082CE6XK,"""Nobody tells you it's gonna be so hard...Yes they do Kim, that's pretty much all people say."" Kim (Ritter) and Deena (Bosworth) are best friends. They do everything together. One night when both bring home a guy they discover a problem. One year later they are still best friends but now Kim has a baby. Trying to balance work, friends and her love life all around being a single mother turns out to be harder then she expects. This is a very funny movie that is almost done like an Apatow movie. The dialog is very witty and hilarious and keeps you laughing throughout. The beginning of the movie made me feel (as a parent) a little annoyed at Kim. It felt like she considered the baby a burden and that she didn't really want him. Her feelings did change but that part did bug me a little. Other then that and the movie being a little predictable this was very very funny and I recommend this. You will not be disappointed. I do have to say that this is more on the ""chick-flick"" side of comedies this will appeal to both men and women. I laughed all the way through. Overall, if you like the Apatow movies you will like this one too. I give it a B+.",1345680000,4,1153,4.269406392694064
5124203,4,B0082CE6XK,"I liked this movie. Its not earth shattering or mind altering but it has great perspective about expectations, ambition and preconcivied ideas. worth a look.",1378339200,,157,5.32

5124208,1,B0082CE6XK,"So the movie is about abandoning your kid so today's women can get laid. The lie about it once it starts happening. Slow, very poorly written. Not sure if it is even worth once star. More like a Amazon Prime freebie that should have been left at blockbuster.",1354665600,,258,4.395833333333333
5124209,3,B0082CE6XK,Considering this movies plot was based on the main character taking responsibility for herself I felt the ending was predictable and wrapped in a nice hollywood bow.,1353715200,,165,5.148148148148148
5124210,5,B0082CE6XK,Love it! Been a fan of krysten Ritter for a while and watched it solely because of her. Starts out kinda slow but for an indie movie it's really funny and refreshing. I wish these people were my friends and we would party together haha,1353715200,,235,4.2444444444444445

5124212,4,B0082CE6XK,"This is a comedy movie starring Krysten Ritter, and Kate Bosworth. The movie begins with two party girls who go out one night and have a one night fling and one of them gets pregnant. She then must deal with all of the realities that go along with the responsibility of parenthood. This movie was pretty funny throughout the entire film. Nearly everyone will enjoy this movie but it will be especially funny for those whom have had a child. The movie deals with many of the life changes that take place such as balancing work and a newborn baby. The lead character is especially discouraged because of the differences in her life and that of her best friend and roommate. There is a good message and a lot of laughs and everyone should be able to relate to some parts of the film.",1351468800,,780,4.423611111111111
