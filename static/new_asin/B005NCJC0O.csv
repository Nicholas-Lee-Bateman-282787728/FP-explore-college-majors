Jaya is very professional and does a great job of
describing and taking you through the exercise workout.
She changes outfits for each segment of the dvd, and the set
has a  beautiful dance studio background.

Her dance choreography is fun and challenging for a beginner.
It moves quickly, so stay focused!

She concludes with a meditation at the end.

My only sadness, that the dvd was not longer!
I hope she does some followup dvds expanding on this one.
Her teaching style is excellent and engaging!",1364515200,4,539,4.752688172043011
