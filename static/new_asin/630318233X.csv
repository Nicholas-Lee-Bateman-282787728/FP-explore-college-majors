I did not take supplements.  I did drink 2 gallons of water daily and ate a healthy balanced diet of chicken, fruits, veggies, and canned tuna.  I do not have a lot of money, and was able to lose pounds and have kept it off now for 6 years.  I love Gilad because he delivers a safe workout that works!!",1453766400,,471,3.8645833333333335

7840821,5,630318233X,Gilad fat burning workout it the best overall workout tape.  I had this tape years ago and wore it out.  I was so happy to find it even though it was on vhs.......I could not find this exact tape on dvd.,1386547200,,203,3.926829268292683
7840822,5,630318233X,"I lost 80 lbs doing this workout 5 days a week and watching my calories for over a year.  It is an old Gilad workout, but it is no joke!  Gilad's workouts are amazing.  I have much newer Gilad workouts on DVD now, but I still hold this workout in the highest regard.  I keep a VCR just so i can still do this tape.  The newer ones are great and are easier on the knees, but this is the one that literally changed my life.",1380931200,,421,3.8488372093023258
