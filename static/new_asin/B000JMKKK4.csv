2678214,3,B000JMKKK4,I expected more from this film.  The ending was disjointed and abrupt.  Even my kids were disappointed...,1239580800,,105,5.117647058823529
2678215,3,B000JMKKK4,"I bought this dvd hoping to find out what happened to the series. It and Afro Samarai both looked interesting to me. But the latter I'd had the benefit of seeing mostly on Spike TV. THough it too faded from obscurity I believe you can still catch Afro Samarai online over at Spike Tv's website if not at its own website. So I settled for Mosaic which was another one I had planned on seeing. I was really hoping to find the animated tv series that was promised way back when. It looked interesting but only found this movie instead. My take it kind reminds me of Sue Storm, Spidergirl, and Nightcrawler's daughter from xmen if they were to have a lovechild? Maggie'd be the one. I really hope I can find the series though. It would be quite interesting in a b-series kind of way to see just how low she'd go to blend in to this or that clique...Farting contests anyone? Some people say this dvd was a waste of money. I don't buy it...I mean I kind of value the lesson in what super hero is in the Condor comic and story that was included with the dvd. 10 things that make a super hero...indeed",1180310400,,1093,4.259615384615385
2678216,5,B000JMKKK4,"i love this movie it is so cool, i wouldn't see this unless you are a stan lee fan",1179619200,,82,3.3684210526315788
2678217,2,B000JMKKK4,"Mosaic is a made for video cartoon, similar to current trend in animated adventures akin to  Marvel's Ultimate Avengers, Iron Man or (Upcoming) Dr Strange...However that is where the similar style ends.

Stan Lee, The creator of Spiderman, Dardevil, The Fantastic Four and Stripperella (well 3 outta 4 aint bad), did the story of this female high schooler from the high school of the performinbg arts,  who gains super powers from a mystical rune stone. It sound like a revamped female  Spiderman without a radioactive spider...and it don't work.

 When it plays out, the chatacter of Maggie acts like a teen Superhero Barbie doll

The first problem is Scott Lobdell, who can write an X-Men comic book so well, seems lost in the script of this animated adventure. He give Lee's Script an edge, but it seems like a recycled Spidey to me.

The second problem is Oscar Winner Anna Paquin (Rogue from the X-Men movies) and Kirby Morrow (From Stargate: Atlantis) try to act the linesm rather than playing it like a cartoon. They sound so wooden  in their vocal presentation. Paquin, who was in xmen, should know superhero text is more over the top..she plays it like Shakespeare

the good news, This animated cartoon  is better than most cartoon stuff out today. The visual efforts are over done, but it works to convex its action

For 72 minutes, it draws so slow it  feels like 2 hours> Foe a made for video animated adventure, i have seen better

2678218,1,B000JMKKK4,"Wow, I tried to watch this because Stan was involoved but it felt completely uninspired. I watched it on Cartoon Network And still found myself unable to get interested even though it was ""free"" to watch, my recommendation is rent it before buying it. Honestly though, I think most will agree the animation is horrible and the story is completely uninspired.",1174780800,,358,4.885245901639344
2678219,2,B000JMKKK4,Oh wow...a superhero Barbie...not even a good story.  Strike one! A new never heard of race of men?  Strike two!  A love story of sorts with a lizard of sorts!  Strike three you're out of there...more thought went into the box design then the story!,1174003200,,249,4.466666666666667
2678220,1,B000JMKKK4,"..judging by the 5 star reviews for this mess. Stan Lee has managed to churn out something worse than ""Captain America"" or the Fantastic Four TV show.

  Utilizing the ""little blonde girl saves the world"" template, Mr. Lee created a new super hero with chameleon-esque powers (don't ask me how, it is never clearly explained) who battles a race of human/chameleons who want to ""take over the world"". YAWN...

  Of course, the little blonde girl is perky and cracks tiresome jokes even when the bad guys are pummeling her. And of course, she has ""Daddy issues"" - her father is an Interpol agent who is tracking down the bad chameleon-people too. ""They hurt my Daddy, I'll show them (and Daddy)"" - So instead of therapy, the main character chooses super-heroing. Barf, Gag, Ugh!!

  To make matters worse, the animation is boring, completely uninspired. Stan Lee really needs to stop making these things.

And I thought ""Dazzler"" was the worst female super-hero ever...",1171843200,2,967,4.91358024691358
2678221,4,B000JMKKK4,"This flick was surprisingly good.  It was expecting ""very good"" and then got ""great"".  Not only did I like it, but my daughter loved it.  I hope that Stan comes out with more ""Mosaic"".  It is a great concept and a great story.",1170806400,,226,4.186046511627907
2678222,3,B000JMKKK4,"I can see from this animated movie Stan Lee is ensuring a new breed of super hero audience is being engaged to keep this form of entertainment alive and kicking. Not written as an adult-gauged story, but more for current youth to experience the genre of animated entertainment targetting the topic of a normal person becoming empowered with abilities beyond the norm. Scott Lobdell, known for writing about character development in his comic stories during the Uncanny X-Men days, definitely was true to form in putting much focus on the main character changing from a young actress to a hero. Young family members 15 and under will probably appreciate this more, as this is not written to present Stan Lee's old work or something even close to this as times have changed - so has Stan's storytelling to adjust with the times.",1169856000,,826,4.823943661971831
2678223,5,B000JMKKK4,"Stan Lee sets up a new super heroine, with a bit of a twist on one of his older character premises -- that of one of Spider Man's old villains, the Chameleon -- by creating a new character, Maggie; an up and coming actress and college student, who finds herself thrust into a situation that leads to an unexpected adventure.

I won't spoil this too much, but it involves a search for ancient artifacts, a race of shape-shifters and a freak accident that gives Maggie her newly-acquired abilities (seems to be a classic Stan Lee approach to how a normal person becomes a super-human, but it really never gets old).

Anna Paquin does great, as do the rest of the voice cast (notable is Gary Chalk, from recent TRANSFORMERS fame).

The film does do some conventions that you don't normally see in animation (blood and broken bones, to name a few), so I really don't recommend this for younger kids. A few jaded comic book fans may just yawn at the story, but the writing is classic Marvel (Scott Lobdell did the screenplay, based on Stan Lee's story). I only recommend this for any true collector of Lee's work and animation in general, but aside from that I enjoyed this DVD.

8152423,2,B000JMKKK4,"This in no way shape or form visually compares to the Marvel movies like Dr. Strange, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk Vs etc. The voices were horrible and the story line was sub par. No wonder I saw this on sale for $5. The only reason I gacve it two stars was because I know the effort it takes to do an animation.",1252540800,,309,4.0
