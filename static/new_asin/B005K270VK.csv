4714404,5,B005K270VK,"I enjoy most animated movies, especially with colorful characters, and an exciting story. The introduction of a cat and a child, bad guys and the police, and who's running for their lives, or who is being chased. There's plenty of excitement with a theme of good-verses-bad. Fun-filled, Enjoyable, and Entertaining. Highly Recommended!",1343260800,4,335,5.461538461538462
4714405,4,B005K270VK,"The style of animation is not one I especially appreciate. That's quickly forgotten though as I became absorbed in the sprightly tale of cops and robbers, life and death, a cat and a kid, all set to a vivacious score. There are some dark themes touched on but the story bounces along without dwelling in the dark places for long.",1329004800,30,329,4.5

4714407,5,B005K270VK,Beautiful artwork.  Fantastic story with funny dialog.  There is just one problem...poor animals getting hurt.  Including the dog that seems to the worst luck but he still comes back for more,1497225600,,191,5.096774193548387

4714411,5,B005K270VK,"Unique animation and point of view in a cute story.  Good for adults and older teens but might be scary for younger children.  Deals with the loss of a parent, a workaholic mom, and a scary bad guy with a happy ending.",1492732800,,218,4.166666666666667
4714412,4,B005K270VK,"Terrific story and animation. Small children, however, might find the kidnapping subplot frightening.

My only reason for not giving it five starts is there is a gap of several minutes in the English language subtitles around the middle of the DVD.

I am somewhat deaf, but the English spoken dialogue is fine.  I bought the DVD some time ago, so maybe this issue has subsequently been fixed.

One can combine either English or French dialogue with either English or French subtitles, which is a very nice mix-and-match option.",1491782400,2,527,4.954545454545454

Well I ended up buying it.  I won't tell the film, but suffice it to say, it's clean, hilarious and very moving.  A bit of an artsy cartoon with a Euro flare.  Very well done.  Highly recommend.",1491523200,,337,4.203125
4714415,3,B005K270VK,"This is a wonderful film, but I was disappointed that the French language option isn't available when you purchase the streaming option. I wanted to show this movie to my French class, but it looks like I will have to purchase the DVD.",1491436800,3,235,4.488372093023256

4714430,5,B005K270VK,"I am very glad I watched this movie before it went off of prime video. Very sweet, it is easy to see why it was nominated for a hugo award and carious other awards. Does have some gun scenes that American viewers may find too itense for younger children (odd as it is with so kany cop shows on tv in this day and age). It is established that the father, a cop, died in the line of duty. Minor screen with blood from a cat scratch. No foul language. If unsure if this is an appropriate film for the family, watch it in advance. It is only about an hour long. A definite favorite. This film is absolutely charming and will make you laugh and your heart jump for the characters.",1482883200,,675,4.121212121212121

4714442,3,B005K270VK,Morals are lacking. Thief gets girl but doesn't get punished for stealing. Seemed rushed for that. Bad guys are as incompetent as the three birds in animaniacs. Mother is ok with the exception that she reminds me of Angelica's mom from the Rugrats. I didn't get the little girl playing mute part. It seemed dumb the Movie could have been cut 15mins if it wasn't for the mute business. Stop copying song of the sea it had a point for it.,1481328000,,436,4.395061728395062

4714446,5,B005K270VK,"I was so pleased with this little movie. I showed it to several of my student classes, 4th and 5th grades, as a reward for having 10 weeks of excellent library classes. We have investigated different kinds of animation for about the past 3 years and they know the differences between hand-drawn and computer generated art. They have, also, studied Picasso and were delighted to recognize what seems to be his style. They loved the jazz music and the buildings they have been taught about in Paris. What a delightful way to show them how much they really have learned in school.",1480809600,,577,4.666666666666667
4714447,5,B005K270VK,"Just finished watching ""A Cat In Paris"" released by Folimage Studios.
If Alfred Hitchcock had made an animated movie for Disney, I suspect that it would have been pretty similar in tone and style to ""A Cat In Paris"" because director Jean-Loup Felicioli and wrtier Alain Gagnol certainly pay homage to the late great master of suspense movies in this delightful animated movie.
Zoe is a little girl who has gone silent after the violent death of her father by a gangster in Paris.  The only individual she seems willing to have an interaction with is Nico - her cat who loves her unconditionally and who shows that love by bringing her dead lizards that he has caught on a daily basis - much to the dismay of Zoe's mother - who is a Superintendent in the Parisian police force.  Zoe is watched over by a nanny/house keeper when her mother is away.
Each night, when Zoe is asleep, Nico saunters out and meets up with his other human companion - Dino - who just happens to be a rather graceful cat burglar.
Curious to see when Nico goes each night, Zoe follows him, and ends up discovering that her beloved nanny is actually a gangster moll in the employ of the man who killed her father.  Zoe is discovered and she flees, led by Nico, into Dino's house,where he rescues Zoe from the gangsters and tries to get her safely back to her  mother.
But when Dino is caught with Zoe, her mother doesn't believe he's telling the truth, until he escapes to rescue Zoe.  And in the best tradition of Alfred Hitchcock Dino and Zoe's mother unite and battle the gangster on the spires of Notre Dame Cathedral and save Zoe.
A compelling animated movie.
Strongly Recommended!

4714523,3,B005K270VK,"A Cat in Paris is an old school two dimensional drawn cartoon before computer animation and 3D detailed Pixar style films dominated the genre.  The human characters aren't the most attractive looking people in the cartoon world, but the buildings and background images do capture the look of Paris quite well and look quite good.  The cat who is more of a sidekick than the main character, is drawn in a fun way, as are other animals such as a yapping dog who the cat takes a moment every night to make sure it is punished by its owner for yapping at it.  None of the characters other than the acrobatic cat burglar are that likable.  Like most kids films these days there is a dead parent, the remaining alive one doesn't really know how to interact with the child, this mother certainly doesn't like her daughter's collection of dead lizards that her cat gifts to her each night.  Unlike most kids cartoons she also has bizarre nightmares of the crime baron who murdered her husband constantly appearing with the body of a red octopus who strangles her to death.

The crime baron doesn't physically look that intimidating, and is more of an overweight bully towards his mentally challenged henchmen than anything else.  Although this could make him more terrifying for children as he's more realistic to ones they may have seen in real life or simply school yard bullies.  Most characters don't have a lot of personality, especially the daughter.  The cat has plenty though and isn't afraid to join in on a human fight.

A Cat in Paris is definitely different to the Disney, Pixar dominated norm.  Although I would point out most recent released by them also have the threat of death to the main character by villains (Good Dinosaur, Zootopia etc), as have most children's movies and stories for that matter. Maybe because the Belgians and French have drawn this one with humans should be more so why those criticising  this aspect of it should really have a problem with it.  Not that I see villains wanting to kill, characters as a problem myself.

It only goes for 62 minutes, you can watch the DVD with the original French voice actors and read the subtitles, or with English speaking ones.  It's worth watching once, but it's not really something I'd watch a second time.",1468108800,,2278,4.688442211055277

4714627,3,B005K270VK,"As of late, I've been trying to broaden my range of movies; in particular, seeking out animated films from other countries (other than America), as these titles tend to get the shaft at the Oscars and/or just generally go unnoticed. When this movie kept popping up in my searches, and having an Academy Award nomination under it's belt, I decided to give it a try. It only clocked in at an hour long, surprisingly, so I thought, ""why not? Let's see if all the good reviews live up to the hype"".

By the movie's end, I'm left very divided. This seems to be one of those cases where one element was done so well, that the rest of the film suffers a bit in comparison, but more on that in a moment.

Set against the shadow-drenched alleyways of Paris, Dino is a cat that leads a double life. By day, he lives with Zoey, a little girl whose mother is a police detective, and whose father died at the hands of an evil crime lord. By night, Dino sneaks out the window to work with Nico--a clever and charming cat burglar who is constantly staying one step ahead of the police, but has a surprisingly gentle heart. But one night, when Zoey follows her cat to figure out where he goes at night, she accidentally stumbles upon the criminal who killed her father. Pretty soon, the girl finds herself on the run from the crime lord and his thugs, leading her cat and the cat burglar to have to become unexpected heroes and save her life.

Starting with the good, I've yet to see/hear the original French language track, but I think it's still safe to say that all the English voice actors did a great job in bringing the characters to life, especially Nico the cat burglar. And don't be fooled by the cute cover art; this is an unexpectedly dark story for what's supposed to be a ""kids"" film, with murder, shoot outs, kidnapping, violence against both people and animals, and more than a fair share of danger and peril, especially when it comes to the suspenseful finale atop the Notre Dame cathedral. Simply put, this is an animated film noir; something I have yet to really see in a cartoon.

However, it's not without it's problems. For one thing, I'll admit the traditional animation was a refreshing change of pace, after CGI seems to have dominated cartoons everywhere. But while I DID like the style itself, none the less, I feel it didn't really service the story very well once the action really got going. It's great for when Nico is sneaking around doing his cat burglar stuff, or for the more comedic moments, but not so much for when the story would turn grim and serious (and I'm talking, like, nearing Pulp Fiction levels of grim). For how dark the plot got at points, I feel a different art style was in order. Not to mention the fact that because of the style, the characters don't really express much emotion on their faces; they're all pretty much stuck on either a simple smile or frown, and rely heavily on the voice work to get their emotions across.

And speaking of the plot, while it was engaging, interesting, and more than suspenseful, it does suffer from a bit of choppiness. I understand that for a crime thriller aimed more for kids, you have to have some comedy relief to balance things out. However, I don't think the humor was executed very well. After being so invested in what happens to Zoey and Nico, it almost slows the movie down whenever we have to cut back to the airheaded thugs and their antics. It also, in turn, makes the dark plot harder to take seriously. When you see a dog get flattened by a cinderblock in cartoony fashion and not be harmed (and yes, that DOES happen at one point), it then becomes more difficult to feel danger later on when the heroes are being shot at or beaten up by the villain. Either go full on cartoony or full on real life when it comes to the physics. And this applies to the comedy too. The occasional funny moment is fine, but it seems like some of the comedy was forced in here. This movie should've either went full on comedy, or full on serious, and in trying to do both, it makes both sides of the coin kind of awkward.

As for the characters, they're all decent. Zoey is kind of flat and more or less a plot device for the heroes and villains to fight over, and she remains largely mute through the whole thing (due to being in shock and grief over the loss of her father). But she's not annoying or unlikeable, at least. The crime lord is appropriately villainous, and his interactions with his thugs has shades of the Godfather. Zoey's mom is the tough, no-nonsense cop, who is bound and determined to catch her husband's killer, while still trying to make time for her daughter. Her nightmares over confronting the killer are crippling at times, and brings the movie up a level. As for the titular cat, he doesn't talk...and surprisingly, doesn't play as big a part as you'd think. He's there essentially for all the main characters to cross paths with each other, and once they all do, he pretty much shifts to the background as a tag along to Nico, who, by far, is the best and most interesting character in the whole movie. Although he's stolen a ton of stuff, he gives off more of a ""Robin Hood"" kind of vibe, as he never really does any physical harm to people, and seems to resort to thievery just for the challenge. And when Zoey's life is in danger, he swiftly takes up the role of a guardian angel; risking everything to save her.  It really makes me wish the plot focused more on HIM and gave a little more backstory into how and why he became a thief--a huge bit of screen time that I would've enjoyed more, instead of watching more scenes with the bumbling thugs that, frankly, weren't very funny.

I'd rate this movie at 2 1/2 stars, but since Amazon can't do half stars, I've rounded it to three, as there WERE a lot of things I enjoyed about this movie. It was certainly very different from what you usually see in a standard ""kids"" film. However, there were some characters that needed more focus, while others should've been cut out all together, and while the pacing is okay, it definitely needed some work in regards to balancing out the dark stuff and the funny stuff. This movie doesn't seem to know what it wants to be exactly....but I applaud the creators for trying to give us something more unique. I'd recommend this for kids 12 and up, due to the above-mentioned violence, and even then, I'd screen this ahead of time to see if your kids are ready to see such heavy material.",1444780800,,6478,4.442388561816653

4714659,3,B005K270VK,"A very cute little movie. I'm glad I watched it. My only problems were: the villains, dialogue between the villains, and the girl's voice problem. A lot of suspense was lost when the villains were revealed to be incompetent. Did the good guys really win in the end because they were that good, or was it because the villains were that bad? Also the dynamic between the villains was very stale and it only made for one or two good jokes.  The voice thing with the girl felt forced, or very much like a gimmick (such as the character Ferb from Phineas and Ferb who's shtick is that he doesn't talk much). I understand in the beginning where she's mad at her mother, but elsewhere it's just awkward. There's one scene where she could've saved the day if she just spoke, but she didn't because.... it was like the invisible script god was gagging her. I thought she had an actual voice problem (which I would've liked), but no. She spoke perfectly fine. Ultimately it was a good little movie. I didn't come out feeling like I was a better person. I didn't gain a new perspective. I didn't feel compelled to rewatch it. I didn't feel that much catharsis, only a satisfying sense of resolution. Also the main character burglar guy should still serve time in jail even though he was good. He's good, but he steals.

I don't mind movies like this that are in English, but I want them to have cultural aspects that make it worthwhile to show my students.

4714768,5,B005K270VK,"While the art style is not necessarily the greatest it is certainly unique compared to many other cartoons I have seen over the years. It is flat in its design and reminds me of cut out figures I used to make and play with as a child. The story line was a bit more serious than I was expecting from the designs but still dynamic enough to enjoy for all ages with an open mind. Over all I enjoyed this movie as it had realistic interactions between characters (such as the child's shock from her fathers death and depression at her mother's inability to realize the neglect she has been in caring for her child despite the great love that is displayed). The focus on the cat was just an added benefit in watching this movie as far as I'm concerned since he acted much like my friends cat, all snobbish and aloof but lovable and caring of his can opener pets (i.e. his owners :3).  Since I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone I'll leave my character analysis at that. I do believe I will be letting my nieces and nephews watch this movie later as I don't have to worry about the extreme violence usually found in cartoons now. While there is some violence and death, I do not believe it is any worse than the violence and death than what I grew up watching Disney movies. In the end I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wishes for a happy ending for their movie night. If you want to understand my title I would recommend watching until the end, it's predictable but very sweet.",1427587200,,1499,4.334519572953736

4714852,5,B005K270VK,My 5 year old grandson and I watched this movie and we both loved it! The art of the animation was different from the usual Disney/Pixar movies out now - and beautiful. The plot was interesting to both of us - my grandson loved this movie even though the main character is a little girl and her cat (he sometimes has trouble relating to female characters - being more a super-hero fan).,1417478400,,386,4.375
4714853,4,B005K270VK,"Great film that doesn't pander to little kids. Myself and a 5 and 8-year old really enjoyed this film. Other reviews state they turned this off in the first few minutes when it was stated that Zoe (the protagonist)'s father died. I don't see how that's different from Grimm's fairy tales presenting orphan heroes or the first paragraph of James and the Giant Peach (where it's stated both James' parents have been killed). Zoe being mute is something kids will take at face value - it's never overtly stated and it didn't occur to the kids I watched with that the fact she isn't speaking is unusual (she doesn't talk? okay) or that it may be related to her father being killed (a pretty sophisticated conclusion probably beyond a young child's ability to extrapolate).

A fun, adventurous story about a girl, her cat, Paris, and some cartoonish mobster bad guys presented in an appealing, matter-of-fact way that kids should appreciate.",1417305600,,936,4.85

The story line is creative and has a very unique feel.

All my children (I have seven ages 4-16) adored this movie and want to see again and again. We rented on Prime, but I will eventually buy to add to our permanent collection.

It's difficult to say what exactly draws the viewer in so much, except that every child will see their fears and nightmares touched upon and then resolved with the finesse of a master. Loss of a parent, bad guys, caregiver turned into a monster.  And the security of love and hope drawing a safety net around her and bringing healing to lonely broken hearts.  It's a story of the triumph of loyalty and love.

THEN . . . Then along comes a CAT, a pernicious, sly, wilfull CAT, sidling his way into the burglar's life, mellowing him.

A cat that during the day is the pet of a little girl. Oh, DOOM, I tell you! DOOM!

Then comes that AWFUL, HORRIBLE, ROTTEN, NO-GOOD night, when the cat, the little girl, the burglar, and the little girl's mother (a police superintendent, no less!) meet! OH GOD THE CRUELTY!

By the end of the night the cat burglar is RUINED, RUINED, RUINED I TELL YOU! A BROKEN MAN!

He becomes a (gasp!) HERO, risking his life over and over to save the little girl from some other thieves (all right, admittedly nasty ones), all with THE POOR DELUDED FOOL THINKING the cat IS HELPING HIM!

Then, THEN, this sap, this fall guy, he . . . no no, it's too horrible! Stop now, you have been warned! . . he IMPRESSES THE MOTHER with how protective he is of her little girl, and the end-oh! the pitiful end!--comes when the cruel, manipulative, SHAMELESS cat and little girl have done their EVIL EVIL deed--

The cat burglar is RUINED FOR EVER, DOOMED to being the WILLING THRALL FOR LIFE of that soft-furred cat and of that trusting little girl! HOW COULD THEY!

Cats and little girls, oh, how they work their way in, with their smooth ways and their eyes filled with trust and care, and you think it won't hurt, you'll just let them into your life for a little while, you can resist their siren call of innocence and insouciance, and before you know it . . .

WHAM! there you are, all of a sudden filled with. . . Oh GOD NOOOOOO!

4715066,4,B005K270VK,"America gets its fair share of animated films from France, but this one was exceptionally well done. From Folimage, the studio behind Mia And The Migoo, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. So that alone makes it worth looking up.

 The film is set in modern day Paris, and deals with a cat burglar named Nico that befriends an actual cat(whose name we never cat)that also doubles as a housecat for Zoe, a lonely young girl that lives worth her mother Jeanne, a police detective whose husband was killed by an infamous criminal mastermind, Victor Costa. Victor plans on stealing a large statue from a Paris museum, and has his over-perfumed girlfriend posing as Zoe housekeeper to get info from the police. Despite a lot of bungling from his henchmen, Victor does nearly succeed in his plan, although Zoe's teaming up with Nico through their shared cat manages to bring them together, and reluctantly Jeanne too, despite her knowledge of Nico's ""career"". The bad guys are foiled, and somehow Nico is cleared of his charges, and is now living with Jeanne and Zoe as a family.

 The titular cat plays the intermediary throughout the story, and surprisingly doesn't have a speaking role in it or any inner monologue like Garfield, but still lives up to his role as the focal point of the movie. This movie was totally hand-drawn, so serious props to Folimage for putting on a quality production. It's style might seem a bit adverse to American audiences, but it's old school approach in both style and substance makes it an enriching experience for audiences of all ages.",1395100800,,1585,4.794871794871795

4715145,5,B005K270VK,"""A Cat in Paris"" has an amusing plot, kid-safe adventure (depending on the kid, of course), and characters that are easy to like. There's the cat, of course, living his double life - kind of makes me wonder what my own cats are up to. Strong female leads also stand out, in the form of the girl and her mother. And there's the lovable rogue, the burglar who comes through in the end. That much is enjoyable entertainment, ahead of the pack but nothing truly memorable.

That's where the animation style steps in. We've been through the computer-y stuff and the attempts at realism. Fine - but it's warm personality, strong style, and interesting use of imagery that really makes a movie, no matter what kind, and this has wonderful visual style and personality. I can't draw close similarities to anything else I've seen, but there might be traces of Cubist influence here. Whatever it is, it works in transforming this movie into something with a touch of magic.

4715148,3,B005K270VK,"I still remember the first time I saw the box for A Cat in Paris a few months ago. I was looking for a movie for my daughter, and then I saw it- something I never saw or even heard of before. Whenever I see a new, mysterious animated movie pop up on the shelf like that, it always gets me interested. It's no secret that Disney and Dreamworks dominate animation these days, and to see something with a cool look to it like A Cat in Paris does, is a breath of fresh air. Sadly, I was stuck watching the English dub version when I was able to watch it, causing me to put up with a very pitiful performance or two. It may not seem fair to factor that into my review, so if I can watch the movie with the French voices, I'll up the rating...provided that they ARE better.

Zoe is a young girl living with her mom, Jeanne, in Paris. Her father was killed by a nasty gangster, Victor Costa, and it's left Jeanne (who works on the police force) a little obsessed with catching the murderer. She has nightmares about Costa, in the form of a red octopus for some reason, coming after her, and all her efforts to stop him being ineffective. Zoe also has her babysitter, Claudine, for support, but her main friend seems to be her cat that leaves every night and brings her back a lizard. Zoe doesn't talk at all, seemingly traumatized by what happened with her dad, and it doesn't help that her own mom barely pays attention to her. Meanwhile, Costa is still at large with his henchmen and they're looking to steal a huge African statue that's about to be displayed at the local museum. We also see that the cat just so happens to work with Nico, a burglar in the area. Nico just steals jewelry, never hurting anyone to get what he wants. Can you guess what's going to happen with these groups once Zoe follows the cat and Nico one night?

First, I want to mention how nice the animation is in A Cat in Paris. It's nothing brilliant or beautiful, yet the look works, fitting the mood and tone of the story. Watching Nico's body flow like a snake as he creeps around in the opening sequence got me a little more interested in the movie, wondering how serious everything here was going to be. For the most part, characters move and behave realistically, except for Nico when he's sneaking and being stealthy. My absolute favorite part of the animation was a simple white line on black segment where Nico is moving through a dark room with night vision goggles on. Simple, but great! It adds a very unique quality to the character that I liked. The settings also caught my eye with how colorful locations were, even with the majority of the movie taking place at night. I'd love to see some production sketches and paintings if any are available. It's too bad an 'Art of' book for this movie hasn't been made! The film's soundtrack is also very fitting, blending with the visuals perfectly. This movie has a ton of style and I'd love to see more like this. Finally there's the cat, who admittedly doesn't get enough screen time. I loved how he would step in when needed to help with an escape, doing his part in a fight, and especially when he'd just casually walk by the neighbor's dog, causing it to bark and get silenced by the owner. The cat rules.

...ok as you can see the good things I said had to do with the art, music and the cat himself. Why? Because everything else threw me off. The plot isn't terrible, just done to death. Luckily the movie's very short and doesn't drag on, even with the sub-par story. I would've liked more to be done with Jeanne's nightmares instead of just seeing octo-Costa laughing and not doing a whole lot to her. Don't take that the wrong way, as I didn't want to see horrible things done to her, but all he does is laugh for the most part! Jeanne was a very boring character to me as well, only showing emotion when she found out where Costa is, and again later when something big happens. She's just a bland character that could almost be taken out of the movie entirely. In fact, she could! Nico serves as the main hero, more or less, with Jeanne being there because it's standard for a parent to be involved with films like this. And as much as I love the art of this movie, I didn't care much for the lack of facial expressions when it came to Jeanne and Nico. Costa and his boys had some nice expressions here and there, so what happened with these two? The little twist during the film's climax also seemed out of place, even with it being semi-explained before it takes place.

Then there's the voice acting. Dear lord...I know Marcia Gay Harden is a fairly accomplished actress, but the woman should NOT have been cast for the role of Jeanne. Her acting here is the most stale, sleep-inducing work I've heard in an animated film in years. This brings up my point about big names being cast for animated movies when voice actors, trained to do this kind of thing, are plentiful and could use the work. Nope! She got the job instead, and did horribly with it. Ben Stein has more emotion when he talks for god's sake. They even got Anjelica Huston to play the role of Claudine, a fairly large role in the first half of the movie, then goes to waste in no time. The other actors do fine, fortunately.

A Cat in Paris didn't leave much of a lasting impression on me, save for the poor voice acting fiasco, and I doubt I'll watch it again in the future. It's hard to recommend this to any specific groups- the movie doesn't have any blood, no sense of danger due to Costa's men not being much of a threat, and only really has one fight scene. Yet I can't really recommend it to kids under 10, and it lacks a lot of substance for it to be for anyone aside from animation junkies. Due to the short runtime though, there are worse ways to kill an hour of your time. If you have the option to watch it in French, I'm pretty sure you'll be better off, even having not heard it this way.

Even Shaq would have been a better choice over Harden.",1365984000,9,5966,4.322321428571429

4715150,5,B005K270VK,"I stumbled upon the trailer on iTunes and bought the dvd because I knew I would enjoy it...and I did!

I agree with previous reviewers that it's a nice breath of fresh air from your typical Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks fare today. The characters weren't designed to be licensed for toys or slapped on merchandise that would sit on store shelves; they were created simply for the sole purpose of telling the story. The overall visual look has a nice, loose quality to it and has a definitive drawing style (reminds me of a certain fine artist, but I can't put a finger on who exactly.) It's just refreshing to still see hand drawn animation these days as great as highly exacting, pixel perfect rendered 3D art is. The story is lighthearted, humorous, and has some interesting twists! I only watched the subtitled version so can't speak for how the english dubbing was.

4715152,5,B005K270VK,"My eight-year-old daughter discovered this title at our public library and after watching it, we liked it so much we decided to get a copy for our home library. Dubbed in English, this 2010 French animated feature is pure delight from beginning till end. The story is a cops and robbers burglar story and the deft narrative devices and beautiful hand-drawn animation elevate it above a regular cartoon feature.

Set in Paris, the story centers around a young girl named Zo (English dub by Lauren Weintraub) who lives with her widowed police commissair mother Jeanne (English dub by Marcia Gay Harden). Zo's cat likes shadowing a burglar named Nico (English dub by Steven Blum) and when the cat gives Zo a 'present' in the form of a bracelet, Jeanne realizes that the bracelet might be tied in to the spate of burglaries in the area. Jeanne and her team are on the trail of a notorious criminal named Victor Costa (English dub by JD Blanc) who was also responsible for Jeanne's husband's death.

The story moves on at a fast pace and kept our interest. The plot is engaging, peopled with interesting characters, both benign and sinister, and my daughter could not take her eyes off the screen. She loved Zo's character as well as Nico, and though she was a little afraid during certain nail-biting parts, she enjoyed the movie immensely.

The little girl is so bereft that she is mute.  Her mother is a detective also, so the looming threat throughout is whether the gangsters get the rest of the family as well.

4715188,4,B005K270VK,"A cat has two humans--which is pretty common if the cat gets the run of his neighborhood, as this one does.  One human is the young daughter of the widowed chief of police and the other is a cat burglar.  The cat and the cat burglar are very adept at negotiating the roofs and walls of Paris.  The cat is, of course, the hero in this movie because he encourages the good guys to be better guys and stand up to the bad guys.  And thankfully, the cat does this  as a cat, not as a human in cat form.  In fact, I enjoyed that the writers, directors, and animators actually appreciate the character of an ""independent"" cat.  (OK, I like cats a lot, but a dog is the quintessential ...)

The characters develop somewhat, but mostly they play their appropriate part.  A theme I enjoy is a parent growing in appreciation of her child, and that is probably the most real part of this story.  Another wonderful theme is that of redemption for several of the characters.

The animation is quite artistic and amazingly involving as it sweeps across the roofs of the city.  A strange part of this art is that the colors seem to pulsate, as each cell looks hand colored with an unusual method.  In this day of ever-more-real-looking animation, I found myself enjoying this art, although I found it difficult to watch at first--so much so that I almost stopped watching the movie.  I am glad I didn't.  I not only got used to it quickly, but realized it is a fundamental part of the expression of the movie.  It provides a very strong extra dimension to what would otherwise be much more two-dimensional.

In retrospect, I found this movie is art that is truly enjoyable as a complete work, more even than other French animated movies I have enjoyed.  And that really surprises me.",1352160000,,1767,4.46875

Last night, I announced to my eight year old son and his gang of hoodlums that we were going to watch a movie about ""a cat in Paris."" They looked at me with a face somewhere between skepticism and betrayal. As the first images started to splash on material made to put people to sleep, the gang of five were suddenly wide awake. This morning, they were still talking about it. This film is a perfect example of limitless format of animation.

4715193,5,B005K270VK,"My initial interest in A Cat in Paris came from an excellent review but I was also interested in seeing the film from my own interest in cats and that the film is hand-drawn animation.  The story revolves around Dino, a cat that lives a double life. By day, he is the pet of Zo and by night, he is the companion of a bugler, who appears to be as flexible as a cat.  Zo's mother, a somewhat neglectful parent, is a police inspector, seeking to capture a notorious criminal. The characters of the two stories soon join together when the criminals her mother is after endanger Zo.

I enjoyed the animation. The colors are magnificent and the style of drawing was a refreshing change from the CG animation that is more often used for animated films. I must add that I got so caught up in the story that I didn't try to guess the cast members that were doing the voices, as I usually like to do.  The DVD includes a short film called Extinction of the Saber-Toothed Housecat (a very tongue-in-cheek story) and The Many Lives of A Cat Video Flipbook. A Cat in Paris is a charming story, imaginatively drawn and boasts a marvelous jazzy soundtrack. A Cat in Paris is a wonderful film for the family that, I, for one will want to see again for the artistry of the animation and the fun of the story.",1350259200,26,1291,4.322314049586777

""A Cat In Paris""
(Folimage/New Arts, 2010/2012)
------------------------------------------------------------
A real gem from French animators Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol... This brilliant, stylish, wildly creative thriller has a look and feel unlike anything being produced in the United States these days. Visually the film is gorgeous: the graphic design is odd and angular, with purposeful nods to film noir's camera angles and use of darkness and shadows, along with a color palette that's filled with rich, unusual choices. The delicious graphics are complimented by a slinky spy-jazz score that feels alternately moody and retro.

Thematically, ""A Cat In Paris"" is practically an anti-Disney kids' movie: it's stylish and unpredictable; there is a dead parent, but it's the kid's dad, not her mother (who, rather than being dead is a strong, no-nonsense police detective... A great female role model, along with the movie's young heroine...) The story is intelligent and brisk, a refreshingly original plot about a clever cat who slips out at night to join a lithe, roguish burglar who likes stealing stuff just for the challenge but has a strong sense of right and wrong when it comes to taking care of little kids. Best of all it presents cats in a favorable light and makes fun of dogs instead. Like I said: the opposite of Disney.

Lots to love here: alt-oriented families who enjoy material that's fun but off the beaten track will definitely want to check this on out!  (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)",1348963200,52,1605,5.463709677419355
4715196,5,B005K270VK,"European animated films are lot different from the Disney classics and the CGI images in the Pixar produced films. Two examples of this are recent DVD releases of two 2011 Academy Award Nominees, interestingly both from the same distributor - GKIDS - and both being released on DVD and Bluray by New Video. One is ""Chico & Rita"" - which is in Spanish and which I'll be reviewing separately and this - ""A Cat in Paris"" - is from France. But for it's US release the film was ""dubbed""  (if that's the proper term for an animated film - in English with a cast that includes Marcia Gay Harden, Anjelica Huston and Matthew Modine.

The film is short - just 62 minutes - and the end credits seem to take nearly five of those minutes. The production crew - mostly French - is huge. The art style is modern, with sharp edges, somewhat like a Picasso painting. But with European animated films, it's more about the story - and the music - than that the graphics look real.

This is a story of a cat burglar and a cat that ""burgles"". (You'll understand when you see it.). There are bad guys (but mostly comical ones) and some exciting chase sequences (over the roofs of Paris) made even more exciting by a superbly written suspenseful musical score that would fit well in any Hitchcock film.

There is nothing offensive here and even children (8 and up, I'm guessing) would enjoy watching it. I do have some reservations, however, as the moral issues that come up in the script. I find it hard to explain how a person who robs houses for a living becomes a ""hero"" in the end. You can decide after you see it - and I do recommend that you do!

The Bluray/DVD combo package comes with some interesting bonuses, though I'm greedy in wishing there was a commentary track (Like ""Chico & Rita""). What we get is the 3  minute animated short ""Extinction of the Saber-Toothed Housecat"" that accompanied ACIP in theaters, and a 9-minute ""Flipbook"" showing the story boards of three versions of the film. Because the film is animated, the producers were able to allow the viewer to watch the film in French with English subtitles, which gives it more of a French flavor. (In the English language version, the characters sound like they are from New York).

It's great that this is being made available for home video as the film didn't have a large distribution in theaters.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4715197,5,B005K270VK,"""A Cat in Paris"" (""Une vie de chat"") is an enjoyable animation film about a six-year-old girl Zo and her pet, a cat named Dino. Dino has been leading a double life, unknown to Zo, who stopped speaking after a tragic event happened to her family.

When night comes, Dino sneaks out of the little girl's Paris room and becomes a trusted partner of a master thief stealing jewelry. One night, however, Zo too goes out alone at night following Dino, and she gets involved in trouble when overhearing the gangsters planning to steal a precious African sculpture.

Directed by Jean-Loup Felicioli and Alain Gagnol from France's acclaimed animation studio Folimage, the film was nominated for Oscar in 2012 (but lost to ""Rango""). The film's highly stylized artworks, based on designs of old-fashioned, hand-drawn type of animation films, may not appeal to you at first, but keep watching. You will soon forget it as the film's adventure story unfolds, involving the cat, the cops, the criminals and the girl.

The simple story of the 65-minute film starts out slowly, but picks up the pace, told effectively with occasional low-key humor, nice jazzy soundtrack and creative ideas (animated ""hide-and-seek"" in a pitch-black room, for instance). The film benefits from the stylishly drawn night sceneries of Paris - most of the main events take place at night - including the top of the Notre Dame cathedral.

The film deals with potentially dark themes, but discreetly treats them. Story-wise, ""A Cat in Paris"" may not be as unique as that of another French Oscar nominated animation, Sylvain Chomet's ""The Triplets of Belleville,"" but ""A Cat in Paris"" is an entertaining family picture.",1347408000,3,1679,5.007168458781362

8476438,4,B005K270VK,"Slight, short, but clever and well-animated French feature about Dino, a housecat belonging to  Zo, the mute daughter of widowed Parisian Police Superintendent Jeanne. Dino literally moonlights as the familiar/lookout for smart, sardonic cat burglar Nico.

When Jeanne's work, Nico's Life of Crime, and a vicious (but comically bumbling) criminal gang led by Victor Costa's (the man who killed Zo's father) plot to steal the invaluable Colossus of Nairobi statue collide over the course of a single night, the mute girl finds her only consistent ally to be the cat burglar. High rooftop action, betrayals, and adventure ensue, before the wrong crook is exonerated, the right crooks are captured, and Zo gets her voice back.

The artwork is highly stylized, and the story ratchets up the tension without being too graphic or horrible for a young audience. The ending might be a bit too fairytale for adults, but it's emotionally true to what's happened before.

8476443,1,B005K270VK,"I came into this expecting something impressive given the Academy Award nomination it's received. I can safely say it didn't come close to living up to that sort of hype. Really I'm kinda boggled that this managed to even get into the running for that award. The only thing it's got going is that the funky art style makes it visually unique (although for me it just looked weird). Nothing else much stands out.

Warning: Vague spoilers ahead.

The story was very simple and blunt. The female lead character (a little girl) has a hard time speaking, so early on much of the exposition is delivered by other characters just describing the state of things at her. There is some vague emotional back story that is brought up, and seems like it might make for an interesting exploration of the characters. But it rapidly takes a back seat to events that put the one-note villains and their dull attempts at humor on display. This really hurts the movie as the villains fall hard into ancient, heavily-used archetypes and so can't really bring much to the table. Although, the protagonists don't fare much better. There's lots of space to give them character, that the movie mostly squanders. So what's left is just a shallow ""the good guys vs the bad guys"" story.

One other thing that bothered me: although the cover and the title might make you think the cat is a main character, he mostly takes the role of a side-kick. Usually he just follows the other characters around or is used as a Deus Ex Feline to help them out. This unduly irritated me as I only heard of this because it sounded like an ""animal movie"", but really it's more a ""human movie + minor cat"".",1504915200,,1661,4.567114093959732
