2379575,5,B000A8AXXG,I love the movie A Hazard of Hearts.  Have watched it over and over.  Was so glad to get this on DVD.  Thank you.,1467504000,,113,3.625

2379577,5,B000A8AXXG,Good movie,1460764800,,10,4.5
2379578,2,B000A8AXXG,Here you get two films in one package and on that count the price is right. From there my interest in this DVD goes down hill. The story line in both films is pathetic and did not hold my attention. I love British period film but these are such a  disappointment. Helena Bonham Carter has matured into a compelling actess in her various roles in film over the years. See Room with a View. This film called  Lady Hamilton must have  been very early on in her career. She adds very little to creating  a  compelling depiction of the msin character. You might not want to waste money on this one.,1457222400,,593,4.306306306306307

2379583,5,B000A8AXXG,"This movie was really great... I enjoyed it.  Since I've been retired, I've been buying many of these Victorian era movies because I like to watch them in the winter time when I can't get out in the garden.  It's nice to cuddle up with the kitty and nice cup of tea and watch a good romantic story.  There really hasn't been any Victorian era DVD that I haven't liked so far... yes some are much better than others but I seem to like most of them just fine, and this was a very interesting story.",1446854400,,496,4.145833333333333

2379588,1,B000A8AXXG,"Amazingly bad british programming. Which is a rarity. But, then again, it is Lord ""Low"" Grade presenting it and written by the overly prolific 'romance' queen Barbara Cartland. Diana Rigg is a hoot and has her moments, but her old Avengers producer could've done much better by her than this tripe. I spent the time drawing six degrees of separation comparisons between actors. Diana Rigg and Anna Massey both played Mrs. Danvers in PBS productions of Rebecca (a much better romance by a much better writer) while dirty old man Edward Fox (in an over the top hammy performance as the villain) is the father of Diana Rigg's 2nd Mrs. Dewinter (Emillia Fox) and Anna Massey's 2nd Mrs. Dewinter was Joanna David, Edward Fox's wife and Emilia's mom. Gareth Hunt, a New Avenger, made a brief appearance as a highwayman with a heart of gold. It's handsomely filmed and costumed, but...yawn. There's much better romance out there, ladies. Read Jane Eyre again, or Wuthering Heights or Jane Austen or Mary Stewart, Daphne DuMaurier, or even Anya Seton and Georgette Heyer. Please.",1444953600,,1071,4.922651933701657

2379600,5,B000A8AXXG,"Hazard of Hearts is an awful, awful movie, with an abomination of a script.  Fortunately, the excellent cast fully realizes this, and plays their roles to the hilt.  You'd be hard-pressed to find a single backdrop without obvious tooth marks, they way they're chewing on the scenery.  If you like romances, and have anything resembling a sense of humor, you'll love it.

Haven't seen Lady Hamilton, so really can't comment.",1431993600,,423,5.0
2379601,2,B000A8AXXG,"Only watched A Hazard of Hearts. It is a silly young girl's romantic novel put on screen. With villans and hero's, so bad and so good. Might have liked it as a fourteen year old girl. For a grown-up just a waste of time. After the first few minutes I just went fast-forward for the scenes of the leading lady with the leading lord, for I am a romantic at heart. But the film was C-level stuff, not worth a dollar and not worth more than 15 minutes of your time (although it takes up a lot more if you let it). Dreadful very outdated music and bad quality pictures. No developing characters, which is the greatest lack of all. And not giving a good insight in what life was like back then. As interesting as the first computer was compared to what we have now.",1430524800,,759,4.205479452054795

2379603,4,B000A8AXXG,"Gave it a 4 only because I love Hazard of Hearts, but I thought the other movie was trash. I just won't watch it, but its worth buying for the 1st movie alone.",1427760000,,159,3.8484848484848486

2379621,1,B000A8AXXG,"This is NOT a high quality BBC production  Catherine Cookson's novels as I mistakenly thought. Both of these are very low-budget, low-quality movies with extremely poor production values. One of the movies reminds me of a cheesy Italian-made movie of decades past.  Helena Bonham Carter is a youth-full beauty here so  if you are a big fan of hers then you might like it, but if you are looking for a PBS Masterpiece Theater  type movie, you will be disappointed.  I could not even donate it my local library since a couple of scenes are what used to be called 'naughty'.",1417996800,,571,4.6138613861386135

2379626,5,B000A8AXXG,"Though I thought these BBC productions a bit dated, it was really interesting to see many of these actors I am familiar with in twentieth century productions when they where youthful in their acting careers with BBC acting still performing now in the twenty-first century.  You really see how these actors where going to become the great actors they are now.  The evolution in these actors performance is delightful to witness in these early performances of BBC.",1414886400,,462,4.987012987012987

2379651,2,B000A8AXXG,Hazard of the Hearts was very overacted.  It seemed to be more of a TV show than a serious presentation.  Corny is the best way I can describe it.,1392076800,,146,4.0

2379660,1,B000A8AXXG,"Well you get what you pay for I guess and this cheap DVD is rubbish because of its poor image quality. On my 42"" HD TV the image looks smudged and fuzzy and it flickers constantly making it completely unwatchable. I suspect the two films have been compressed onto a single layered DVD meaning that they have half the image resolution they should have.

This is a shame because 'A Hazard of Hearts' is a great little film. Helena Bonham Carter was never more beautiful or more adorable than she was in this film and it is otherwise well cast and a very enjoyable bodice ripping romp.

So I finally bought a good DVD copy of  'A Hazard of Hearts' from Australia (region 4) with a brown cover put out by ViaVision and Madman and it is a much better copy and comes up very nicely on my HD TV.",1383868800,,788,4.24

When he gambles away their estate, all his money, all of her money and her hand in marriage , Serena must deal with fact that she is now engaged to Lord Vulcan, a man she does not know.

I love that it goes hand in hand with romance, mystery, passion, and swash-buckling adventure! Who doesn't love to see the handsome and confident Justin Vulcan coming to save the day!?
""Lady Hamilton:"" I can see why they paired these two together, because no one would ever like Lady Hamilton unless they liked to also hit their head with a hammer all day. I think that they had to pair these two films together because no one would ever want to buy Lady Hamilton on its own. Disgusting in its over sexuality. Basically, everybody is falling head over heels for ""Lady Hamilton"" who looks like a prostitute, and behaves like one too.
Unfortunately these two movies are on the same disc. It's definitely worth the cheap price, but just ignore the film ""Lady Hamilton"" if you don't want to waste an entire evening thinking ""Why on earth did I watch that garbage?"" and ""Who in the world would waste the money and time making this?""",1378598400,,1044,4.679347826086956

2379674,4,B000A8AXXG,"A Hazard of Hearts is a typical Barbara Cartland story - the young Helena Bonham Carter is perfect in the role of Serena - Diana Rigg is a great vilain - it was nice to see Stewart Granger in his later years - a real stunning actor in his youth, he still looked pretty good.  It's entertaining good to watch if you are interested in the actors -

Lady Hamilton is a great film in the sense that it portrays the condition of lower class women in England in the early 19th Century extremely well.  I have used it to show my students the appalling situations that women found themselves in simply because they were women and had no protection from their society.

I used to pass by the inn where Emma Hamilton and Admiral Nelson used to meet at Box Hill in England very often and even had breakfast there once.  Watching the film gave me a full picture of what Lady Hamilton's life was really like.

The performances are really very touching and powerful.  It's a film that makes you think and feel glad that you were born after female emancipation!  A great historical piece.",1374364800,,1073,4.411167512690355

From her historical information to her characterization it is an enjoyable read and the DVD production carries excellent acting by Diana Riggs, Helena Bonham Carter, Edward Fox and an all star cast. Lady Hamilton was new to me but the story line and the acting in that are also high quality.  I will probably wear the DVD out because I watch it so often.

I started watching ""Lady Hamilton"" (same film quality), but when I saw the part where she's going to take a dip in the pond, to clean up, I turned it off.  I really don't see the necessity for filming naked people... guess I'm so used to the classics, where they didn't need to spell things out for adults.

I know that a lot of adults don't mind nudity in a film (so, PLEASE, I don't need your opinion of my not liking it).

As for myself (and others who share my opinion on anti-nudity in films), I do wish Amazon would start letting their customers know what a film consists of (especially the BBC movies, which never show a rating).",1364860800,,720,4.272058823529412

Maybe it's Helena--looking like a pouty baby in her 80's fake Victorian dresses (wow, could the wardrobe BE any worse), or all the dreadful yet disarming ""eyebrow acting"" by Our Hero...there's just something redeeming here and I thoroughly enjoyed it. And what an overheated score! You'll love it. There's also a wonderful cameo by Stewart Granger, a fantastic old Hollywood favorite and one of mine, too. He's sincerely wonderful, and truly underrated in his long career (he passed many years ago). And Diana Rigg...holy guacamole. Such a great actress, but in this role, she channeled Joan Collins in all her bitchy glory. And her wardrobe was a polyester nightmare. So laugh at the lameness, and make fun of the ridiculous plot devices, but you will still enjoy the charm and romance.

Perhaps this is the one that launched Ms. Bonham Carter, but we've not heard much from Mr. Gilbert since.  I am sure the ladies regret this, as he is knee wobbling in this.

You'd have to enjoy costume dramas to find it funny; if you don't like them, you'll hate this all the more. If this was all unknown actors it probably wouldn't be nearly as laugh inducing. Diana Rigg charging around caverns in period dress is great. Bonham Carter absolutely does the best possible with this role and she and the hero are mercifully given little dialogue- in this movie it helps no end to not have to actually say anything.

I liked it and when I heard it was going to be on television. I watched it with my mother and had to admit that I liked it. So of course I was looking for this on VHS and could never find it. So when I found out that Amazon had the DVD for sale I of course I had to purchase it.

It didn't make a romance novel fan nor did I ever read anything by Barbara Cartland either. But this book and movie I will make an exception.

However Lady Hamilton was too old to watch and in bad quality.",1276905600,,644,3.7279411764705883
2379744,1,B000A8AXXG,A Hazard of Hearts is a bit on the boring side.  It appears to be a made for television cheesy romance movie with lack of depth. It was very predictable.

2379749,4,B000A8AXXG,"This review is for ""A Hazard of Hearts"" only (the other movie I have not seen).  I got it out of Netflix because Helena Bonham Carter is one of my favorite actresses --she combines spunk, spirit, class, and sex appeal in one fiery little package (Tim Burton is a lucky man!).

<spoilers>

""A Hazard of Hearts"" strikes me as a classic Gothic romance, the sort of story that you'd see in the bookstore next to the Harlequin romances featuring a young heroine on the grounds of a gloomy castle, being watched from a balcony by a handsome, brooding ""Darcy-esque"" young man.

Helena Bonham Carter plays Serena,the daughter of a nobleman who commits suicide after losing her in a reckless wager to a lecherous peer (played by Edward Fox).  Her virtue is saved by Justin, a mysterious but handsome young peer.  But he professes indifference to Serena.  Will Justin and Serena fall in love?  Will the evil peer triumph?  What do you think?  ""Hazard of Hearts"" is hardly an unpredictable movie, but it is quite fun to watch and the acting impeccable and the production values quite high.

As for Bonham Carter's performance, it was quite good, and an indicator of even better work lying ahead for her.  The only thing that works slightly against her is the fact that she doesn't really look her age at the time (21).  There are moments in the film, where I would have guessed her to be in her mid-teens.  Given the actor paired with her does look his age (29), they seem a bit mismatched..it would have been smart to have paired her with a younger looking male lead...I think if they had done that, the word ""jailbait"" might not have popped up in my mind when I saw them embrace).

Also, I thought the score was a bit overdone, but that might have been intentional.

But ""A Hazard of Hearts"" is good fun nonetheless.",1251331200,,1807,4.565217391304348

2379752,4,B000A8AXXG,"This review is based only on the movie A Hazard of the Heart (or Hazards of the Heart) which I found in our local library. (I didn't see the second movie, but other reviewers mention that one being ""trash."")

  It's been a while since I've seen a movie I liked as well as this one. (I'm a fan of some of the Masterpiece Theatre classics, Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice, etc.)  This movie was made in the late 1980's. The setting is 1800's England.

  Central to the movie was a sweet romance (just tender looks, hand holding, and kissing scenes similar to Pride and Prejudice).

  The icing on the cake for me included villains, ""haunted"" and extraordinarily beautiful mansions, breath-taking English countrysides (often experienced via horseback), magnificent paintings and period dress, sword fights and a duel, hidden passageways, surprises, and decent acting (Helena Bonham Carter, in the lead, has a gift for expressing what she is feeling, without any words).  Like Pride and Prejudice, the story even includes a big dog (a Great Dane, I think).

  The male lead, introducing handsome Marcus Gilbert, was extremely good.

  The supporting cast were favorites --Christopher Plummer,  Diana Rigg, (as the villain mother), and Stewart Granger (as the lovable father).

  The story begins when a father (played by Plummer) gambles away everything he possesses, including his daughter (played by Bonham Carter) and her dowry, to a sinister character named Lord Ruten (sp?) (played by Edward Fox).

  Tables are turned when handsome Lord Vulcan (played by Gilbert), issues a challenge. With one shake of the dice, Lord Vulcan takes possession of all that Lord Ruten has just won, rescuing the poor daughter, at least momentarily, from Lord Ruten's evil intentions.  At first, Vulcan is suspect as being a heartless womanizer, but a different side emerges as the movie progresses.  Serena (Bonham Carter's character) seems to bring out the best in him.

  Hazard of Hearts is about as innocent as a romance comes, but there were a few violent scenes (though not very realistic, there were murders via sword, and one unscene suicide).  There is also a scene when Lord Ruten kidnaps Serena and attempts to molest her in a moving carriage (though the intensity is lightened somewhat and some humor emerges when she gets rescued by a kind robber).

  My husband, who's not much of a movie buff, especially enjoyed the music and the swordfighting.

2379756,3,B000A8AXXG,"Hazard of Hearts is a decent storyline and good acting and plot.  It is the second movie ""Lady Hamilton"" that draw the rating down -- way way down if it were to be evaluated by itself.  Imagine 1960's Italian dubbed filming, fuzzy-edged picture.  The lead female character is supposed to be irresistible to everyone--with her fake hair and really thick eyeliner--even to the female monarch.  The other characters -- well, I was reminded of ""Hercules"" with Steve Reeves from whatever timeframe that was.  If you pay $5 for the package, just ignore the second film and enjoy the first.  Romance in the Barbara Carland style.",1169078400,,622,4.876190476190477
