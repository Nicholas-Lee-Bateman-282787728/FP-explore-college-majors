2898803,5,B000TGJ8GC,"If you compare the concert in Madison Square Garden of Marc Anthony with Victor Manuelle's, you'll see the difference in production. Marc Anthony has the means of pulling all tricks out of a hat, where Victor has to do with much less, but for this dvd, less is more!!And if you're looking for a real Salsa feeling, this is the dvd to get. The apotheosis with Puerto Rico is amazing!!! Lot of fun and the whole dvd makes you wanna dance!!! Great concert!!",1336867200,,454,4.481927710843373
2898804,5,B000TGJ8GC,I highly recommend this DVD. Victor Manuelle is very talented and entertaining. His live performance was outstanding. I watched it three times when I first received it. It makes you want to get up and dance. I can't wait for his next album to drop.,1203724800,,248,4.533333333333333
2898805,3,B000TGJ8GC,"Yo fui al concierto Del Madison Square Garden, y jamas el DVD se iguala a la Fantastica Presentacion que Victor Manuelle en vivo. Corto muchas partes buenas ademas que solo una hora y media para el DVD no me gusto. NO le hace justicia el DVD al concierto para nada.",1194652800,,265,4.32
2898806,5,B000TGJ8GC,Victor Manuelle at his best..Awesome DVD especially when Gilberto Santa Rosa and Sin Bandera performed with him.,1194307200,,112,5.647058823529412

8209173,3,B000TGJ8GC,Adquiri el producto porque segun dice el editorial es la version que viene con el CD del mismo concierto...pero resulta que no es asi..fue una gran decepcion solo encontrar el DVD al abrir el empaque..de resto el DVD con el concierto no tiene desperdicio.. Sin Bandera y Don Omar acompaan en la precentacion!!,1374883200,,309,4.849056603773585

8209175,3,B000TGJ8GC,Marc Antony is a better live performer sorry to say.  Although there are some great songs here by Manuelle.  He tends to talk too much during his concerts which is a waste of time.,1359158400,,180,4.264705882352941
