8529658,4,B008QP3WXS,"This French series is quite violent. It handles mature audience subjects, and in the first season  gave this particular police group a bad name. After you get to know a few of these police officers, they are not likable, but have some redeeming qualities. This is a rogue group of policemen who were not been reigned in soon enough, and do their own thing.

The four police agents in the Hauts-de-Seine area of Paris are Eddy Caplan, played by Jean-Hugues Anglade, Walter Morlighem, played by Joseph Malerba, Th&eacute;o Vachewski, played by Nicolas Duvauchelle, and Roxanne Delgado, played by Karol Rocher. Their colleague Max Rossi was accused of criminal misconduct, and committed suicide.

In the first and second series, the four police have been arrested for crimes off trying to kill a bad guy. Many of the upper echelon seem to be in the wrong side except for a new investigator Marceau.
A plan takes the fall goes to jail, Roxanne is demoted and Theo is fired as well as Walter. Life is horrible for all. Another rogue gang has arrived causing havoc and many deaths. Marceau gives Vaplan, Roxanne and Theo amnesty to join a team fighting this new mercenary group. All hell breaks lose, but at least they are doing police work, even though undercover work is much more dangerous.

Series 2 is much more interesting, great writing and acting.

Just when u see no way out for one of their escapades, they find a way, that usu leads to another set of problems. The acting, writing is superb. If u like The Shield, give this a try.
Wish american tv weren't so enthrolled with the supernatural, vampires, resurrecting the dead, and would give us, brits, norwegian, danish, and swedish do",1422748800,,497,4.472527472527473
8529660,5,B008QP3WXS,"Imagine `The Shield', take it out of L.A., plonk it in the middle of some grotty Parisian urban sprawl, cast some magnificently grimy characters, craft some really complex plotting and add a large helping of Gallic style and you have Braquo.

Given what we already know about the scary French criminal justice system from the likes of `Spiral', '36 Quai des Orfevre' et al, it is no surprise that the actual criminal activity is secondary to political machinations and inter-departmental squabbling; all worryingly plausible. Braquo is populated with flawed characters, many with dubious motivations and, much like The Wire, the criminals are in some ways far more honourable and oddly more likeable than those on the other side of the law; at least you know where you stand with a good old-fashioned criminal.

The mood is unremittingly dark, the plotting is labyrinthine, the pace is relentless, none of the characters are likeable and it's incredibly violent. The total antithesis of soggy, cosy, reassuring cops shows (Blue Bloods and Heartbeat spring to mind), Braquo makes me even more sure than I was before that I will always be very nice and appropriately subservient to gendarmes (their guns alone are scary enough !). Roll on series 3 - will the odious Vogel get his comeuppance?",1421539200,,1290,5.051643192488263
8529661,4,B008QP3WXS,"Branquo concerns a highly unorthodox squad of Parisian police who break every rule, including murder, to get the bad guy. Always one step ahead of the authorities, you have got it, The Shield has come to Paris. Unlike the strike team however these cops do not break the rules to get rich but to catch the bad guy. The main cop Eddie is also far more likeable than Vic. The second season does stretch believability but if you you like tough police action shows with shootouts, gangsters, ex foreign legionaries, plenty of official corruption and the odd bit of sex then this is for you. Beware however the violence is gory and real and starts in the first scene.",1374624000,2,661,4.563025210084033
8529662,5,B008QP3WXS,"Just watching a few minutes of the first episode were sufficient yo make me stay glued to the monitor. The scenes you see are straight to the point, nothing fluffy, no ""shiny high gloss"" images like with the american crime shows. A review I read a while ago said the series are gritty, with grim images. Perhaps, but I would add that the protagonists themselves are gritty in the most literal sense. I watched the first season on Hulu, and a few times when the commercial break came (didn't matter if a movie or a product was advertised), I had to mentally ""adjust"" for 10-20 seconds, because the images in the commercials looked like something from a different planet. I hope this explains the difference between what I perceived as something realistic (Braquo, at least the first season) and something that is not real, something that is all style and no substance (most American movies and TV shows in my humble opinion). Anyway, I'm happy to have this DVD set and it always brings a smile to my face when I introduce someone to french movies or TV shows and they come back to me saying that they ""loved it"". Variety is the spice of life!",1365811200,2,1141,4.543689320388349
8529663,4,B008QP3WXS,"The Braquo DVD set was interesting and largely exciting until the last disk. I enjoyed watching the story unfold, finding it mainly unique and exciting. The story broke down towards the end as it seemed the writers ran out of ideas regarding the internal affairs inspector. The ending was disappointing.

However, I would recommend the set to anyone who likes an action oriented police series. Amazon chose well!",1349568000,4,412,5.0588235294117645
