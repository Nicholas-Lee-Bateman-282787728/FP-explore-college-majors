5818169,5,B00DI67N94,FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON is another classic film from director Mario Brava. Released in 1970 this film features  William Berger (SABATA) who masterfully unfolds his master scheme on his unsuspecting guests like a chess grandmaster.  And then there were none? Perhaps and then some. This atmospheric and moody film is very enticing.,1379030400,,336,5.203703703703703
5818170,4,B00DI67N94,"I don't really understand folks who claim to love Eurohorror, but won't watch films that are subtitled. Anyone with an 8th grade education can read subs, and seeing these classics dubbed by people who do cartoonish voiceovers is nothing more than insulting - to the viewer, to the director, to the actors involved, to the viewing experience. The entire film's focal point is diverted to the gutter and suffers as a whole. Many casual viewers will disagree, but devotees understand my point completely. The English-dubbed version is wretched to listen to - you will not hear ANY of the actual actors real voices, and the flick suffers as much as the viewer does who wastes his/her time screening it. How do I know this? I've seen it in BOTH languages, and it's like two completely different movies...

First off, these are Bava films, so you either love his late-60's work or hate it, period. The same things that we fans of his later 60's output love are usually the very same things that turn others off. So I'm not going to spend a lot of time reviewing the actual movie itself, but rather what's on display in them - the luscious Euro babes with big, teased hair and false eyelashes, the accompanying mini-skirts, go-go boots and chain belts, the futuristic furniture, accessories and decor (the same stuff that's resurgently popular today), the elaborate architecture and European landscapes, the cool cars, the extravagant, permissive lifestyles and hedonistic parties and, of course, Edwige Fenech.
I realize that these things have nothing to do with whether these are good movies or not, but I also know I'm not alone in my rabid fascination for all things from this particular time period, and that WILL have an impact on whether you enjoy these films. Derivitive plot? Sure. Annoying soundtrack? Yup. Predictable outcome? Absolutely. It's akin to Agatha Christie on acid. So if the plot steers off course here and there while enjoying the visual feast on display as described above, who cares? Besides, Bava displays a black sense of humor here that's not present in most of his work outside of his few comedies.

I'm giving it 4 stars because, although flawed, I don't want folks to think it's a cinematic clunker - it's of of Bava's minor gems that's not often seen or available in the states, but definitely worth your time + attention if you enjoy seeing the master having some fun while delivering the gothic goods with a late 60's psych feel, unbelievable architecture, and a cast that includes the luscious Edwige Fenech in one of her first truly sexy and memorable roles. It's a relentless mod murder mystery and pristine parade of eye-candy and loungy, kitschy atmosphere, peppered with sultry sex and murder as only Bava can pull off effectively. But do yourself a favor and watch it in Italian w/ subs to see, taste, feel and enjoy it as it was meant to be.",1375142400,18,2877,4.81010101010101

8593469,4,B00DI67N94,"lol oh my... Bava, such a great cinematographer but these scripts/plots to his movies. If you love 70's style then this oozes it and looks fantastic with a cast of beautiful ladies and 70's dudes. The camera work is excellent and the decor of the sets is a grand slice of 70's goodness, but this script and plot is laughable. It's a murder who done it barely on par with a Columbo episode... but worth at least one viewing just for the visuals. I think only a Bava fan would watch it again.",1492300800,,490,4.279569892473118
8593470,1,B00DI67N94,"I'm a fan of Italian giallo, but I have to say that I don't understand the favorable reviews of this particular movie at all.  The lack of suspense and tension was so monotonous that it took me five nights to finish it, and afterward, I felt completely cheated.  It went immediately into my refuse pile of worthless movie purchases.  Horrible, just horrible.",1487462400,2,358,4.741935483870968

8593472,5,B00DI67N94,"The dubbing's okay - one must remember this was shot MOS like all Italian films so... we're here for the gorgeous camerawork and people, the macabre sense of humor, and antithetical music. The Blu-ray finally does it justice. I only though this movie was meh before - now it really glows and throbs with wondrous color (ditto Kino's BAY OF BLOOD)",1447027200,,346,4.688524590163935

8593474,5,B00DI67N94,"This review is of the 2013 Kino Blu-ray. The film is in very good condition, with strong, warm colors and deep blacks. The image is sharp and film-like, and does not suffer from aggressive digital processing - as some other Bava films have.
This is one of my favorite Bava films, a somewhat tongue in cheek black comedy; a remake of ""Ten Little Indians"". A group of businessmen meet with a scientist on a private island to discuss his new invention - wives and girlfriends included. Things go well at first, until the houseboy is found murdered. That's when they realize no one can leave the island because the yacht has been sent away due of an approaching storm. One by one, people are being killed off - so many in fact that the bodies have to be kept in the villa's cold storage locker. It's all great fun: ruthless businessmen, beautiful women in the late 60s fashions, a mysterious killer on a private island - with bouncy 60s-era lounge music - what's not to like! You can expect the usual Bava double-twist ending.",1441843200,2,1022,4.559782608695652
8593475,5,B00DI67N94,"This Kino blu-ray has only one flaw to my mind -- it's in English and has no option for Italian with subtitles, as with all their titles.  Boo hoo.  Also, big deal.  Even if you heard the ""original"" audio, Bava never used direct sound to my knowledge, and the actors either post dubbed their own lines or in some cases were dubbed themselves (like Barbara Steele).  That being said, you just can't beat this fabulous, lucious version of one of Bava's most beautiful films.  It is also the ONLY blu ray of this great film available, so I applaud Kino in hopes they'll come out with more of the same. (P.S. in one case the Kino version to me is far preferable for not having the ""original"" audio -- Black Sabbath on their blu ray -- as it has the original far superior Boris Karloff dialogue!)

I've heard it said this is one of his lesser movies, that he did it only for the money, etc., but to my mind it is the maestro at his height, filled with Bava touches that no one of the time (or now) comes close to.  Several new Italian obscurites have been remastered and reissued by that great company Raro, but with the exception of one or two, nothing comes close to Bava.  This film does indeed have a ""Ten little indians,"" or ""Then there were none"" kind of plot.  But I don't think Agatha Christie could have come up with the idea of hanging bodies up like a musical mobile of death in the walk-in freezer!  William Berger, the exquisite Edwege Fenech, the ultracool Ely Galleani (the youngest woman), and all the other actors are top notch for their roles.

Bava's wicked wit is supreme here, in the deaths, the freezer scene, and the final denouement.  It's like a crazy carnival of color, blood, and fabulously dressed Italians!  SEE the wildest '60's/'70's party of them all!  Thrill at the inventive and gory deaths of nearly all concerned!  GAPE at the dangling bodies wrapped in plastic moving slightly to a jaunty theme!  FOLLOW the bouncing glass beads and see what secrets they reveal!  AND try to figure out exactly how all this stuff was cleaned up so neatly for a special turn in the plot .... I love this movie.  I think you will too.",1395619200,3,2147,4.447570332480819

according many sites of review blue ray there is Not italian language on this kino blue ray ......",1386806400,,116,4.8
8593477,5,B00DI67N94,"It's extremely unfortunate that Kino has chosen to release this Mario Bava film (as well as others) on Blu-Ray without the option of hearing it in Italian with English subtitles, especially since the release of a number of these works on region 2 has made it clear how readily available such options appear to be. For this alone, it would normally receive a one or two star deduction in my book. If I refrain from doing so in the case of FIVE DOLLS it is because the image quality is absolutely stunning, and the audio commentary by Tim Lucas is also truly first-rate. (One of the highlights: the discussion of Bava vis--vis Kandinsky.) In fact, the ideal way to watch this Blu-Ray may be with the audio commentary, since it allows you to focus not on the silly plot or egregious dubbing (neither of which can be attributed to Bava) but on the compositions and overall visual design of the piece. Bava, who spent nearly twenty years as a cinematographer before he directed his first feature, is a master when it comes to lighting, framing, etc., and once you focus on this aspect FIVE DOLLS seems less like ""minor Bava"" than like a major example of his remarkable talent. So while Kino has missed the boat on releasing the absolutely definitive FIVE DOLLS, the image quality + commentary more than make up for its flaws. (But having said all this, newcomers to Bava beware: FIVE DOLLS is not the place to start with this director. If anything, it is where you may want to end. Because it allows you to appreciate his specific talents almost unadulterated, without the distraction of an interesting plot, characters, etc.)",1379548800,15,1621,4.6912280701754385
