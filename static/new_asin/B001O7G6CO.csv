8329921,3,B001O7G6CO,"The DvD did arrive with a scratch on it, though this hasn't seemed to have effected the movie.
The case was such low quality plastic however that one could just as easily poke their finger through it.
No wonder it didn't survive the post.",1371254400,3,238,4.431818181818182
8329922,3,B001O7G6CO,"After a long search, ordered the only available DVD version from US.
Previously only seen a very poor download.
Quality: it appears to be only a VHS transfer - Not restricted to zone 1, so good for UK (zone 2)

Story: nowhere as good as other older or more recent film versions.

I would not recommend it unless you are REALLY keen to have ALL the St Trinian's films in your collection.
I will be watching it with friends to pick fun at it!",1367539200,5,440,4.226190476190476
