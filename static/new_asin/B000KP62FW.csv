2696784,4,B000KP62FW,"While this film is reminiscent of many other made-for-TV film on a form of addiction (drug, gambling, kleptomania, etc.), it's bouyed by an interesting storyline and surprisingly strong acting by Harry Hamlin, and especially Lisa Rinna.  Unlike many other ""Based on actual events"" films, it actually felt real.  I highly recommend seeing it.

A warning: There are two or three scenes of brief nudity in the DVD version which was not aired on television (Lifetime Movie Network).  While it didn't bother me at all, you rarely see that in a ""Lifetime"" movie no matter what medium it's shown.  So I was taken aback for a second.  Don't take that as a knock on the film in any way; it's still a must-see.  I'm just giving potential viewer a heads-up.",1194652800,12,746,4.736434108527132
2696785,5,B000KP62FW,"It's an absolute must for all adolescent males and possibly females.  About a man's sexual addiction:  how it began, how it progressed, and how he dealt with it.  It shows how it affected his marriage and what his wife did about it.",1182038400,,232,4.476190476190476

2696787,1,B000KP62FW,"Of course no woman and no man would like to be betrayed by her husband/wife. This makes the setup of the movie interesting in the first place.

However, things are painted in black and white colors without questioning anything. The guy in the movie buys erotic journals, has a girl friend, and visits prostitutes - so he is really the BAD guy.

What about his wife? What about the relationship? Did this couple ever talk about sex? About relationship? About whishes and dreams of the other partner?  Nothing is told us in the movie.

The wife demands fidelity from her husband like she would demand her pet to be house-trained. She never asks herself how she is involved in the process. The only role she takes is the mortally offended wife who has every moral right to forgive or not to forgive. Somehow she advanced to a kind of god or at least a federal judge.

She does not change within the movie. We do not learn anything about her thoughts of good sex, of a good relationship and her attitude towards men - except that they are bad guys if they are running sex topics on the side.

The whole movie is taken from a very small moral point of view without shining some light on the more complex situation of this couple.

In this way a great change is missed to produce something more than flat entertainment on cost of a very important topic.

This comment does not intent to protect or justify they guys behavior but to point out the poor work which this movie delivers.

The topic is too important to be covered by such a cheap movie.",1159660800,2,1541,4.4361702127659575
2696788,4,B000KP62FW,"Harry Hamlin portrays a doctor with a loving family (a wife and two sons).  From all appearances this is the all american family...except the husband is hiding a terrible secret.  Over the course of time he has become a sex addict.  His addiction requires that he have a secret place for his torrid addiction which he realizes will cost him everything if he is every caught.  However, when he is caught-up in the moment, nothing else matters.  Hamlin and Renna (real life husband/wife) show the devastation a family encounters because of one partner's addictions.  More importantly, can he get help and when/if he does, will it be to late?  This is a must see film.  It makes you think.  This can happen to anyone in any economic bracket, race, or gender.  In this case its the husband with the addiction but women are just as subceptible.",1128729600,,839,4.684931506849315
2696789,5,B000KP62FW,"An excellent presentation of how sexual addiction affects not only the addict, but everyone around them!  Douglas Weiss is a fabulous counselor and speaker, with tons of great material available ([...]  This is real, serious, and devestating!

8158478,3,B000KP62FW,"I had seen this a while back and remembered that I really liked it.  However, after purchasing I was wondering what about this movie ever appealed to me in the first place. Maybe the passage of time has changed my taste, but I thought this was a vapid, shallow film that really wasn't worth watching for a second time.

On a positive note, Harry Hamilin did a superb job in portraying a man with a sex addiction.",1454889600,,412,4.337662337662338

8158480,3,B000KP62FW,"I would have given this movie a better rating, but I did not know it really should be ""R rated"". This movie is ""Not Rated"", which generally has meant (to me) that it is safe to watch. I do not watch movies that contain any nudity at all. I was disappointed that this one does. I'm glad I was watching it alone, though I am still offended.",1428624000,,338,4.059701492537314

8158483,1,B000KP62FW,"I say the movie on TV and I liked it.  There is going on so much deceit between man  and women so I wanted to see if it was something that I was dealing with. Yes, to some extent as I saw what the obsession of one's partner can do to you. All in all it is quite an entertaining movie. You might like it.

8158484,3,B000KP62FW,"Dr. Cameron Thomas (Harry Hamlin) seemed to have the perfect life - a successful practice, a great wife(Lisa Rinna), and 2 wonderful sons. Nobody would guess that prostitutes, pornography and hundreds of one night stands were part of his lifestyle, especially since he didn't even think he had a problem until his wife found out, and Jack realized he still couldn't stop his obsession with sex.",1391558400,,394,4.984848484848484

8158486,5,B000KP62FW,"This film starts somewhat slow, but turns into an excellent film that chronicles the life of someone living with sexual compulsion and what it means to be stuck in a cycle of helplessness. The movie turns out to be a pillar of hope and strength, while retaining its' authenticity. Highly recommended.",1260144000,2,300,4.901960784313726
8158487,4,B000KP62FW,"When I first saw this movie on the ""Lifetime"" network,I was really ingrossed in this movie. Aside from the fact that the main stars, Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin are real life husband and wife,the movie was one of a true,startling and very heartwrenching real life story. The film is played by Rinna and Hamlin as husband and wife and that the husband has a insatiable sex addiction. He goes to extreme limits to satisfy his sexual compulsions, picking up prostitutes, going to peep shows and strip joints and even having his own secret apartment to bring other women to and watch pornography. All the while his unsuspecting wife does not know of this serious condition of his that can very well be compared to a drug addiction or any  other severe compulsions. The wife finally realizes something's very wrong when she is called to bail him out of jail for soliciting an undercover policewoman posing as a prostitute. She is shocked,furious and hurt by what she eventually finds out about her otherwise ""normal"" husband. She gives him an ultimatum to seek professional help for his addiction to sex and lust. He goes and they find their way back to some stable and promising grounds as he really does love his wife. A must see for anyone interested in the complex life of a marriage constantly being tested by continous adultery on the man's part, although women are known to have this""sex"" addiction. Based on a true story, it gives insight,knowledge and hope for these kind of troubled marriages that are actually more commonplace then we think. A stunning and heartfelt movie for mature audiences.",1207267200,5,1600,4.818181818181818
