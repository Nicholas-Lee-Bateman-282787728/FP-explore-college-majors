342032,4,6301661710,"I think people are a little too critical of Beneath the Planet of the Apes. Of course,it didn't match up to the original and almost no Sci-Fi movies except maybe Star Wars can. You really had to watch the original to  get the idea but the effect of seeing NYC in ruins is enough to make me  like this movie. There was also excellent ape acting,like all the movies in  the series.",928627200,,379,4.236111111111111

""Beneath"" is classic Greek tragedy unlike  other ""armageddon"" type movies, it doesnt have a happy ending,  and Nova doesnt get it on with EITHER of the astronauts, but it will  certainly blow your mind.",923961600,,373,4.796875

The main plot involves commenting on the militarization of one society, and the apocalyptic culture of another.  Very much like an Orwellian view of society.  If you liked 1984 you should dig it.

342087,3,6301661710,"Appropriately yet ironically titled, ""Beneath The Planet Of The Apes"" marks a steep drop-off from the indisputable sci-fi classic ""Planet Of The Apes."" When the original proved to be a major hit, striking a chord in the imaginations of audiences everywhere, a sequel was rushed into production. With half the budget and half the talent (a reluctant Charlton Heston agreed to appear only in cameo form and with the caveat that his character takes action to ensure there are no more sequels -- ha!), ""Beneath"" apes its predecessor in more ways than one. Not only does new leading man James Franciscus look and act a lot like Heston (so much so that even sympathetic ape lady Zira confuses the two characters) but the plot has a distinct whiff of been there, done that. Well, until that zany last act, anyway.

It would be all to easy to dump on the film for all of its shortcomings. ""Beneath The Planet Of The Apes"" at least gets a few elements right. The attempt to push the narrative forward and pick up at the point where the original left off is a good start. Not too far into the film, Taylor (Heston) and Nova (the striking Linda Harrison) are separated, leaving room for newly landed astronaut Brent (Franciscus) to accompany her. As tensions among apes builds -- some of the film's most memorable images are that of a peaceful ape protest that is broken up with brute force -- the twosome are forced underground, where they discover the remains of their lost civilization. And mutants. Telepathetic mutants at that, hellbent on destruction and worshipping the atomic bomb. Yeah, that's right. This movie goes there.

By far the most bizarre and inconsistent film in the franchise without Tim Burton's name attached to it, ""Beneath"" at least gets by on its bizarre digressions and admittedly chilling visions of a decimated New York City (condemned to the underground, ""Futurama"" style). If nothing else, it's never dull. Thankfully, the series would make a much needed course correction with the melodramatic but much improved ""Escape From The Planet Of The Apes"" and its even more politically-minded ""Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes."" But in the context of the original five ""Apes"" films, this one feels perhaps the most extraneous. Lots of good ideas lost in muddled execution. It's also -- for lack of a better term -- completely and utterly bananas.",1499558400,,2362,4.844059405940594

I wouldn't discourage a fan of the series from watching, just know your getting into a bad 70's television sort of experience... like watching Welcome Back Kotter and expecting to have alotta laughs or something..

342176,4,6301661710,"I like the imagination of the screen writer and movie director.  This movie contains a theme common during the Cold War -- concerns over the effects of a nuclear war that neither the US and the USSR wanted to fight because it would lead to mutual self-destruction of both nations and the whole world as we know it. Then there were several differently theories of what life would be like if any life actually survived such a war.

It's also interesting how the original Planet of the Apes series uses the Apes as a symbol of turning the tables around on humans.  They try to answer the question: ""How would you feel if the gorillas and chimpanzees were the superior intelligent beings and they treated us they way we treat them and other animals?""",1441670400,,746,4.552238805970149

new special features have been added
a new retrospective featurette FROM ALPHA TO OMEGA-BUILDING A SEQUEL- 22mins
new interviews with Director Ted post, Linda Harrison, only Archive interview with Charlton Heston

342227,3,6301661710,"Picking up where the first film left off, Taylor (Charlton Heston) and Nova (Linda Harrison) are in the Forbidden Zone when Taylor disappears. Meanwhile, another American spacecraft has crash landed leaving only one survivor, Brent (James Franciscus). Brent is on a rescue mission to find out what happened to the previous mission. He encounters Nova and they set off to find Taylor.

To be fair, following up on the excellent Planet of the Apes was always going to be a difficult task no matter what. However, this is a decidedly weak sequel. The main problem is the story. The first half just feels like a repeat of the first film. Astronaut crash lands, sees a city of apes, gets captured...It all seems like dj vu. Franciscus's acting could have been better. It seems like his character never really reacted to his situation in a believable way. Finally, the make up effects are definitely a step down from the original and at some points, mainly on the background characters, it really is laughable.

There are some good aspects. The cinematography is essentially on par with the original and the set design was just as creative.

All in all, watching this film just left me with a feeling of what could have been if they tried harder. It is not a terrible film, but it is not that great either. It certainly does not stand up to the original.",1423699200,,1348,4.679324894514768

James Franciscus does his best Charlton Heston imitation, since the genuine article only shows up in a glorified (and reluctant) cameo. Briefly seen in recycled footage, Roddy McDowall was unable to reprise his role of Cornelius  replaced by David Watson, who did a good job emulating McDowall under the John Chambers makeup. The producers drop the ultimate bomb with a cost-cutting apocalyptic climax (suggested by Heston to avoid future sequels).

342306,1,6301661710,"What happened? The original Planet of the Apes is a landmark science fiction bit of cinema that I still rewatch on a regular basis. Top that off with the book also being quite entertaining/thought provoking and I just have a hard time figuring out what went so monumentally wrong with this second film in the series.

For a start, it does feel like the budget was mostly non-existent. True, the first film does not have the sheen of an incredible budget either, but it was beautiful anyway. The performances here are alright, with nothing major standing out to complain about.

The biggest problem with this film is the horrendous story. I won't ruin anything for those of you who have not watched the movie yet, but the whole thing just becomes pathetically bizarre as the reels keep on turning. Taylor has one or two amazing parts in it and I particularly love the finale. But overall, it is painful. And as much of a Planet of the Apes fan as I am, it pains me physically to admit how absurdly horrible the story is in this installment.

I guess you could blame it on the times? Who knows. The third movie is, to me, the true successor to the first movie.

Once you experience the heady release of having actually finished this movie, I say take a break to recover, and then see the third movie, which will restore some small amount joy to your crushed heart.",1409875200,2,1362,4.502024291497976

A good imagination and ability to detach from reality in a big way is key to enjoying this better than I expected sequel. The whole series had some odd timing that at the end of at least the first two films feels right. In the start both seem doomed to just go downhill. However, they get the premise out there and then if you are willing to watch, a clever little examination begins. The characters are pretty interesting, the commentary is actually welcomed, and it somehow all works. Newer incarnations have the technology to make it look so real. This doesn't look real, but it looks like play produced to spark thought. It's not that it's an intellectual piece by far, but it does make you think using some clever original ideas. I give it four stars simply because I really expected nothing and after watching, I was amazed that I actually ""feel into"" the drama. It really is important I think to remember that nothing quite like this had been done. If not a masterpiece, it's brave and encourages new ways to make film. Music lends much to the film.

There's a new astronaut landing, and all of the characters from the first return. It does a good job to give us a little more insight into how the world got this way, explaining the origin of the ape revolution.

The later half of the film can get odd, as some strange characters are introduced. I personally love them, but they are very different than anything else in the series so far.

Overall, Beneath the Planet of The Apes is almost as good as the original. I say almost, simply because of two reasons: it treads the same entertaining ground as the first, but lacks the twist ending. Definitely a must watch if you enjoyed the concept.",1405728000,,744,4.503703703703704

The story is slow and nonsensical.  Chimps rally together into an anti-war movement that ""apes"" the Sixties.  The humans worship an atomic bomb, knowing it's a bomb, fully understanding that it is a piece of hardware.  Imagine encountering a group of carpenters who worshiped a hammer.

342476,5,6301661710,"What is stunning about Beneath the Planet of the Apes is that it works on so many different levels. The story is infused with Franciscus' deeply negative view of human nature. I usually find any hint of social commentary in film to be kind of obnoxious; When I watch a movie, I want to be entertained - not forced to listen to some billionaire director ramble on about their political views. But this one single time I'm making an exception: I loved this as a social commentary, as a drama, as a groundbreaking scifi movie. There is also a very peculiar love story between taylor (charleton heston) and a much younger woman who is incapable of speech or for that matter, any sort of communication whatsoever. I truly give up, this movie is the whole package.

The first time I saw Beneath the Planet of the Apes, I really never have the slightest idea where the story was going. I would have guessed that the apes would hunt down our human protagonists, perhaps beat them up a little, and that the humans would triumph in the end owing to their superior cunning and lack of body hair. But this went off in a completely unexpected direction. Just consider the ending for a moment: Our human protagonists set out to stop some mutant subway dwellers from detonating a nuclear bomb. Then the apes, through sheer insane incompetence, manage to piss off one of the humans so much that he detonates the bomb himself - purely out of spite! It absolutely beautiful! It turned the traditional formula hollywood ending completely on its head!

The original Planet of the Apes movie usually recieves a disproportunate amount of credit for the success of this franchise. Sure, it is certainly a classic, but this sequel has a lot going for it as well.",1397347200,3,1738,4.6396103896103895

The first movie was a short drama of how the tides had turned in the short course of two millennia. As a biologist, I know this is simply not long enough to accomplish what the authors are trying to depict. I also had trouble with the lack of regard for geologic time and blatant disregard for geography. If they hadn't kept so tightly to the idea that the planet was supposed to be earth, I might have had a more enjoyable suspension of disbelief.

Beneath the Planet of the Apes, the second movie in the series, continues the story where the previous movie leaves off. It quickly digresses into a didactic on the mutually assured destruction theme and social divisions. The chimpanzee protest scene seems somewhat contrived as do the escape/evasion scenes

342739,4,6301661710,"I don't have the DVD just yet, but I did see this movie when I was 13 and it was the first one of the series that I saw.

I loved it at the time.

I still do. The movie starts with astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) on a mission to see what happened to the crew of the Icarus. In the process, they crash land on the planet of the apes. Brent finds Taylor's (Charlton Heston) companion Nova (Linda Harrison) riding a horse and wearing Taylor's dog tags. Nova takes him to Ape City and he learns part of the truth; humans are the animals and the apes are superior. They get captured, but are helped to escape by Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (David Watson, standing in for Roddy McDowall). They are chased by gorilla soldiers and hide in an underground they later learn is the ruin of the Queensboro Plaza subway station in New York. Brent makes the mental connection and realizes he is back on earth.

The two humans follow a humming sound deeper down to Saint Patrick's Cathedral. There they discover a race of mutant, telepathic humans who worship a nuclear bomb. Brent and Nova are captured and interrogated telepathically. Later Brent is united with Taylor. Brent tells Taylor about the bomb, which has alpha and omega engraved on its fin. Taylor says this must be ""the doomsday weapon"" that could wipe out all life on earth. Meanwhile, the apes, led by Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans) and General Ursus (James Gregory) have decided to use The Forbidden Zone as a new food source and a legion of gorillas is riding there. The mutants attempt to scare the apes with thought projections of fire and the earth opening up, etc. Dr. Zaius doesn't buy it, however, and the apes discover the underground city and start an attack, killing every mutant they see.

As the apes are bearing down on Taylor and Brent, one of the mutants tries to get them to kill one another. Nova, seeing this, shouts her first word, ""Taylor!"" A gorilla hears this and shoots her dead. This startles the mutant and Brent and Taylor kill him instead. The gorillas start to pull down the bomb after killing all the mutants in the cathedral. Ursus shoots Taylor, Brent shoots Ursus and then gets shot himself. As Taylor lies dying in front of Zaius, he activates the bomb, the earth fizzles out, then we hear Paul Frees in voice over:

""In one of the countless billions of galaxies in the universe, lies a medium-sized star, and one of its satellites, a green and insignificant planet, is now dead.""

When I saw this as a kid, I was flabbergasted. I wanted to see the original immediately, but this was way before home video and, little did I realize, the third movie in the series, Escape From The Planet of the Apes was coming to this theater soon. Eventually, I saw all of them on CBS.

There is nothing new going on here. This is merely a retelling of the first movie, with Heston railing against it every second. He thought this was a bad idea and it was his suggestion to have Taylor pull the nuclear trigger to nip any further sequels in the bud. Little did he know. I do love the atmosphere in this film. It is like most other Fox films from the seventies, in Panavision with that yellow cast that only DeLuxe color processing can give a movie. It has great sound and a decent score by Rosenman. The sets are good, composite matte paintings by the Fox art department vary from the brilliant (the New York Public Library) to the atrocious (the New York Stock Exchange). This film made almost as much as the first one and, even though Richard Zanuck had been fired as Fox's head of production, they went on with with three other sequels.

The events in the next film start an endless causality loop, BTW. Zira, Cornelius and their colleague, Dr. Milo (Sal Mineo) find Taylor's ship, the Icarus, in the Forbidden Zone's inland sea, repair it, and escape the devastation wrought by the Alpha/Omega bomb. They cross back through a curve in space/time and end up on earth in 1973. Zira has a child, Caesar, who spearheads the ape revolt in the 1990's which leads to a limited nuclear exchange and the overthrow of the human race. Two-thousand years later, Taylor appears in the future and whole thing starts all over again. Pretty neat.",1372204800,,4205,4.538258575197889

Critics wanted to see movies like ""Easy Rider"" or ""The Graduate"" or ""Carnal Knowledge"" (a favorite the year this ""Apes"" film was released). I think they couldn't see what was in front of them in this film: a very serious meditation on the relationship between consciousness and violence. There is something in the way the apes simply massacre the mutants at the end, while Zaius prattles on about how evil man is (all this interspersed with Franciosa in his final death-battle) that disturbed me as a child and disturbs me today. Is this the fate of sentient beings?

Brent escapes, and takes refuge in a subterranean city run by advanced humanoids who worship an atomic warhead. What will become of The Planet of the Apes? BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES gets off to much of the same start as the original, and even features Charleton Heston look-alike James Franciscus as the new space captain. It isn't until the third act when the ideals of peace shift towards destruction, and the real plot gets carried underway. The philosophical discussions from the first film have been replaced with political satire that reflects the anti-war sentiments of Vietnam and atomic warfare. Echoes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be heard when the remaining humans shed their disguises, while the chimpanzee protests and demonstrations immediately bring to mind the horrors of Kent State. All of the same incredible costume designs return in this first sequel, along with a number of impressive subterranean sets recreating segments of New York City. Viewers are not soon to forget the explosive climax, which offers an even more nihilistic ending than the first.

342825,3,6301661710,"This is my least favorite of the Apes stories. Still, it provides an important link in the story loop. Yes, it is a loop. After all, when you blow up the entire planet in the second film, you've got to do something strange to create a third. But that's next Tuesday.

This one opens with Astronaut Brent (James Franciscus) bending over the dying body of his commander beside the burnt body of their space ship. They had followed the pathway of Taylor in order to rescue him and his crew if possible. They don't know at first that they are on Earth, but they do know that they are way far ahead in time; some 2,000 years, as a matter of fact. Right after he buries his commander, he sees Nova coming toward him on a horse, and tries to communicate with her. In the process, he discovers that she is wearing Taylor's dog-tags. He seems to have made her understand that he wanted her to take him to Taylor, and she tries.

Problem is, Taylor disappeared into thin air and she has no way to tell that to Brent. So all she can do is take him to Zera, the kindly chimpanzee veterinarian who had helped her and Taylor escape from the apes. That was what Taylor had told her to do if she lost him: find Zera. So Brent and Nova are hiding in the bushes near the town plaza while the Gorilla general declares they must go into the Forbidden lands and take them over to make up for the crops the humans had destroyed in the last round-up. He knows there's someone living out there, but it's not at all clear how he knows that.

So Brent and Nova sneak into Zera and Cornelius's house (they've been married in the interim, apparently), where Zera patches up Brent's wound and helps them get away from the city. The rescue is a clever one, but I won't ruin it for you. Suffice to say the pair are free in the badlands, but there are gorillas hunting for them. They hide in a cave and discover it is actually what's left of the New York subway system. So now Brent knows where he is.

He overhears the soldiers mention that they were told to hunt for them until they find them, and so Brent decides they will follow the subway tracks and go further underground. Eventually they discover an underground ""civilization"" made up of what are nominally humans but have some powers we don't. And they have a bomb, the Doomsday Bomb. They worship it.

Brent is questioned and tortured by the underground people, who consider themselves very peaceful. They don't kill their enemies, they get them to kill each other. Sure enough, Brent is thrown into a prison cell with Taylor, and the two are forced to fight. I won't tell you how they get out of that mess, or indeed anything more of what happens, except as I say, the Doomsday Bomb is detonated.

342826,3,6301661710,"This is one of those sequels that doesn't require the viewer to see the first film to understand what's going on. At the beginning of the movie, scenes from the first film are shown to catch new viewers up. The story however is new.

After the disappearance of four astronauts sent to investigate the galaxies, the ""American National Space Administration"" sends two additional explorers out to find and rescue their comrades. Sadly, these men meet the same fate their predecessors did: Their ship crashes on a strange planet.

The skipper quickly dies upon landing after he sustains a serious injury during the debacle. The other man however receives no afflictions and is the hero of the story. His name is Brent. As he tries to find help after his friend dies, he meets an odd and mute woman named Nova on horseback. She is wearing the dog tag chain of Taylor - One of the fellas Brent had been sent to find and save.

Brent discovers that Nova appears to be harmless. Furthermore, he knows she is the only source of hope he has of perhaps locating Taylor. Together, they ride to a place called ""Ape City"", where Brent learns that this world is ruled by highly intelligent and humanoid apes who know how to talk and speak English. Brent also discovers that the simian civilization is hostile towards human beings. Brent and Nova attempt to escape from their oppressors, but they soon jump from the frying pan into the fire....

It would have been great if Taylor had a bigger role in the movie, but what we received in return was the perfect compensation - Brent is likable, well written and was played brilliantly by actor James Franciscus. By having a new performer, it brought a fresh new presence to the story.

We were also still able to enjoy Taylor to a certain extent because even after disappearing, his presence was still there in a sense because we the audience knew he was somewhere and when he did finally become visible again, he was all the more appreciated.

If Taylor hadn't been in the film, it would have weakened the movie some because the viewers would have wondered what became of him and if he would have been killed at the start, I feel it would have been too depressing and again, it may have even weakened the film because we would have missed Taylor. By keeping him alive and making us wonder what became of him and just knowing he'd be back and then filling in that time by introducing us to Brent and giving us time to get to know him was a good move.

In my opinion, ""Beneath of the Planet of the Apes"" is the most legitimate of the ""Planet of the Apes"" sequels because it is the only one set on the same ""Planet of the Apes"" as the original movie.

I feel the sequel follows the original very well, is the ideal continuation, helped develop the story and is an entertaining film. I'm glad it was made. I would have always wondered what had become of Taylor and the other characters. :-)",1328572800,4,2919,4.504725897920605
342827,5,6301661710,Ah James Franciscus is great.  The original Plant of the Apes with Charlton Heston and this one are the best!,1326585600,,109,4.45
342828,3,6301661710,"***This review may contain spoilers***

Recently, after proctoring a law exam at Suffolk Law School in Boston, I arrived home, idly turned on HBO, and saw ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (hereafter ""Beneath"") was starting.  What the hey, I said to myself, I'll watch it again. About ninety minutes later, I concluded that ""Beneath"" was serviceable, efficient entertainment, if a bit cursory and abrupt (REALLY abrupt).  I thought about it some more, and tended to agree with the late Charlton Heston's assessment that the original 1968 movie ""Planet of the Apes"" (hereafter PotA) was self-contained and that a sequel was unnecessary.  Ultimately, it seems that Twentieth-Century Fox's gleeful avarice overturned Heston's pragmatism and spawned the nearly identical ""Beneath"".

For at least half of ""Beneath"", in addition to a repeat of the iconic ending of PotA, we witness a virtual reprise of the first half-hour of PotA, with Brent (James Franciscus) discovering what viewers already know about the simian-ruled, post-apocalyptic planet.  For human's sake, Brent even closely resembles Heston's character Taylor (except he's a bit slighter), especially after Zira (played again by Kim Hunter) forces him to ditch his astronaut duds for a more revealing loincloth in order to escape immediate detection by the apes.  Even so, gorilla General Ursus (James Gregory) captures Brent and Nova for his army's target practice.  With Zira's help, they escape and plunge into the Forbidden Zone, which is really the ruins of the New York City subway system.

At this point, ""Beneath"" does offer something new - Brent's gradual discovery of mutated, radiation-scarred, telekinetic/telepathic human survivors living in the subterranean shafts and ironically worshipping a Doomsday Alpha-Omega bomb.  It's established that the apes avoid the Forbidden Zone and the subway lair because of the hallucinatory images they can conjure up (like the optical illusion fire and crevice that swallow up Taylor and compel Nova to seek help).  The mutants mess with Brent's mind (i.e. force him to attack Nova, force him to fight Taylor after he is imprisoned with him).  Meanwhile, General Ursus's army, desperate to replenish Ape City's food supplies, dare to march upon the Forbidden Zone.  However, a female mutant reveals that the mind games they can play with Brent don't work on apes because of their brutishly thick skulls.  So when Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), accompanying Ursus, deduces that the mutant's optical effects are fake, the mutants are helpless against them, except for their ace-in-the-hole bomb. So now let's see, Brent and Taylor escape prison by killing a mutant, then find Nova, then Ursus's army breaks in and kills Nova, then the army enters the mutant's shrine-like chamber with the bomb, Brent and Taylor soon follow, the apes kill several of the mutants, wound Taylor and kill Brent, and a vengeful Taylor detonates the bomb, annihilating the world and, seemingly future PotA sequels (not!)

Was that all there was?  Well, maybe ""Beneath"" was not so unnecessary after all, since it does introduce the fascinating human mutant angle, oh, and the increasing rift between the militaristic gorillas and the pacifistic chimpanzees early on.  But ""Beneath"" glosses over these elements in its haste to get Brent caught up on ape lore and give the cynical Heston/Taylor a reason to end the sequel/ape madness.  Perhaps Brent is unnecessary.  Maybe the movie would have been better if it dumped the Brent character altogether and just followed Taylor (and Nova) after they plunged through the fire mirage and encountered the mutants.  That way, ""Beneath"" could have given more time to explore this mysterious underground culture, and as counterpoint, the schism within ape society.  After all, PotA's premise and characters are intriguing and deserve more thorough development. ""Beneath"" literally blew up this valuable opportunity.",1324425600,4,3932,5.340356564019449
342829,4,6301661710,"You would think the final scene of the first Planet of the Ape's film would wrap things up. However, when Fox executives saw the success of the first film a second one was probably inevitable. The producers wanted Charlton Heston back, and Heston stated he would come back only if they assured him that this would be the last of the Planet of the Apes films. They agreed and Heston, as we know, blew the Earth up with the Doomsday bomb. However, even this bomb could not start the onslaught of ape movies that would come latter.

The premises of this film is that another astronaut and crew takeoff from Earth looking for Taylor's lost ship and just happen to go through the same time warp and find themselves on the very same planet. James Franciscus plays Brent the main character who finally finds Ape City and befriends Zira and Cornelius. Brent escapes the city and heads to the forbidden zone. A group of militant gorillas are also heading to the forbidden zone. The forbidden zone features an underground city, which was once New York. The excellent set design of a dilapidated New York is the best part of the film. We see familiar landmarks of the city reduced to ancient crumbling structures. Apparently, this set was originally used for the film Hello Dolly.  The ape's main nemeses here are telepathic humans that create illusions in the mind of their enemies. In a bit of post counterculture nihilism they worship a gleaming nuclear missile. Before they worship the bomb they remove their faces and reveal hideously scared faces.

In the final battle with the apes a gravely wounded Taylor detonates the bomb and the Earth is reduced to a barren lifeless planet.

This really should have ended the series.  The Ape's films that followed were getting increasingly mediocre. Even Beneath the Planet of the Apes displayed cost cutting in the flimsy makeup of some of the extras. The truth is Beneath the Planet of the Apes was the last big budget film of the series.",1323907200,,1976,4.715942028985507

342874,4,6301661710,"This second film is even more pessimistic than the first one. The apes turn military and war-minded because the gorillas take over and for them the only good human is a dead human. We already know that, well nearly that. From an ape general it is not surprising that he apes a certain colonel or is it general too? At least in the end he was a general, but then his horn was too little to be big enough for his appetite. As a matter of fact a second NASA rocket arrives with some more survivors looking for Taylor. But Taylor had literally disappear into thin air when trying to enter the forbidden zone. The newcomer, a certain Brent, recuperates the poor abandoned Nova who takes him back to the Ape city. And from there with a war on their hands they run into the forbidden zone to escape the gorillas. And they descend into the underground destroyed city of New York. There we are back, but with an enormous twist, to H.G. Wells, though the city of the apes is stratified in three classes that are three different species of apes. That sounds a little bit like a Brave New World. But the underground destroyed New York and its survivors have nothing to do with Terminator and the rebellion against the machines. They are pacifists who make their enemies kill each other in couples, and yet are not able to defend themselves since they have no weapon, or nearly no weapons. They have their God nevertheless and their God is a fully operational Doomsday Bomb. And that will be a big bang in the universe when it goes boom. Don't ask why and how all that found itself on a planet that is two thousand years away from the earth. Details, details, my dear Watson. And in the jungle you must presume, my dear Livingstone. And we presume. But a nuclear disaster on the earth brings humanity down, then apes take over and reverse the famous Darwinian evolution, and then war becomes inevitable and the human survivors of that cataclysm are pacifists who refuse to defend themselves except by calling for the help of their God, the nuclear auto de f that destroyed them in the first place. No hope for these humans. 1970 was the year when all hell broke down, out and up in Vietnam and Cambodia and Indochina. There was no other alternative than a nuclear war for some and this film tries to reflect that mood, but certainly not to enlighten us with any hope. Die man die hard man that is your final and inescapable fate. I am still all shivering with the recollection of that 1970 year. Gosh it was bleak.

The burgeoning simian society is made up of three classes.  There are the gorillas; their main activity is to hunt humans.  Those not killed are used for research and target practice.  Their General sent scouts into the Forbidden Zone; only one came back.

Then there are the chimpanzees; they are the intellectuals, scientists, and veterinarians.  Although the gorilla's believe there is nothing to be learned by studying humans, they do allow the chimpanzees to examine and experiment on them.

And lastly, there are the baboons; they are the administrators.  Most prominent, Doctor Zaius is the Minister of Science and The Chief Defender of the Faith.  He is privy to secret scrolls that, if revealed, would expose the truth about man and destroy the apes age of innocence.

In the first movie, Taylor's starship crashes; he is captured, but then escapes with Nova into the Forbidden Zone.  In this sequel, Brent is sent to rescue Taylor, but his starship also crashes.  He meets Nova; she has Taylor's dog tags dangling around her neck.  Where's Taylor?  Why, somewhere in the Forbidden Zone, of course!

If you have not seen the first move: 'The Planet of the Apes', you should watch it before watching this sequel.

Mutants, talking apes, sexy mute cave women, James Franciscus AND Chuck Heston all together....

Now, Taylor is with his mate Nova when he mysteriousely disappears. Nova somehow manages to find Brent, another astronaut who crashlanded onto earth. Together Nova and Brent go on a search to find Taylor.

Charlton Heston briefly reprises his role as Taylor, and in fact the opening to the film, is a reprise of the ending of the original, which is the best bit of the film. Heston reappears in the last 15 mins as well.

With the surprise element lost (because of the ending of the first film), the sequel is mostly formulaic and limited to occasional good scenes. But none have the impact of Hestons first words to the Apes, or the impact of finding the Statue of Liberty on the beach in the original film.

The special effects retain the same high standards as the first film for the apes, but the matt paintings used in the underground scenes now look obvious and dated. Brent as played by James Franciscus is effectively a Charlton Heston/Taylor look-a-like except he doesn't have the screen prescence that Heston brought to the Taylor role.

342964,5,6301661710,"product reviewed: Beneath the POTA, various releases of same widescreen DVD version from 2000-2006

I place this film among my favorite SF movies. Regardless of its status as a sequel, I find Beneath to be a great science fiction in its own right. It is both a post-apocalyptic tale as well as apocalyptic, due to the cyclical history presented in the Apes universe. Astronaut Brent crash lands on an unknown planet far in the future. Apes rule the planet, but are challenged by a surviving race of mutant humans with superior mental powers of thought control. These human remnants also possess a doomsday bomb!

It is interesting that in the final battle, both apes and mutants feel a similar sense of holy crusade against the infidel. Brent is caught in the middle, neither ape nor mutant. He has few allies and no place in this world. Both the film and the novelization focus on the psychological distress that Brent suffers, and James Franciscus plays the part with conviction.

I love this film, regardless of its association with the great Planet of the Apes saga. It stands apart from the first film as a unique story with a mystery that unravels before Brent. The wayward astronaut discovers not only where he is, but what happened to humanity after the near-destruction of the world centuries earlier.

This DVD edition of the early 2000s is widescreen, and the cleanest picture yet. There are no bonus features to speak of. All the key players are dead at this point, but a running textual commentary option by a knowledgable author or film historian would have been much appreciated.

342965,5,6301661710,"Of the five ""Planet of the Apes"" films only the first one and its sequel ""Beneath"" are truly great and worthwhile. The three prequels devolve in quality: ""Escape from"" is decent, ""Conquest of"" is okay (barely) and ""Battle for"" is horrible.

""Beneath"" (1970) is the only actual sequel, hence, both the original and ""Beneath"" should be digested as one long story.

THE PLOT: An astronaut, James Franciscus, lands on the ape planet in search of Taylor and his crew. He makes contact with a primitive babe who knew Taylor (Nova, played by Linda Harrison) and then embarks upon a quest to find him -- leading first to the ape city (where he discovers that apes rule the planet) and then to the ""forbidden zone,"" a holocaust-ruined wasteland where psychic mutants dwell underground.

Growing up I always favored ""Beneath"" above the original. Why? Possibly because ""Beneath"" has a lot more action (especially toward the end) and the concept of the underground psychic mutants was both eerie and captivating. As an adult, however, I've come to appreciate the original in increasing measure; it's deeper than ""Beneath,"" more intellectual. I now believe that each film has its strengths and weaknesses and they both compliment eachother very well.

Many criticize James Franciscus as a weak Heston (Taylor) clone. Although this complaint holds some validity (Linda Harrison described Franciscus as a smaller version of Charleton Heston) and Heston is indeed inimitable (so don't even try), I personally never had a problem with Franciscus in this film. He does a fine job in the role of the stranded astronaut on a planet of madness. His character, Brent, isn't disillusioned with humanity like Taylor, so he has less of an 'edge' or pizzazz, but Brent is a fine generic 'everyman' that we can all relate to.

All the great main characters in the first film are present in ""Beneath."" Aside from Nova and Taylor, the story features Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans), Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius. Unfortunately Roddy McDowall wasn't available to play Cornelius so they brought in David Watson for the part, which isn't a problem because you can't tell beneath all that ape make-up and Watson does a splendid job mimicking McDowall.

A new, equally great character is introduced and that is Ursus, the gorilla general, played by James Gregory (remember him from the original Star Trek episode ""Dagger of the Mind"" as Dr. Adams?). Who could ever forget Ursus' motivational speech ""The only good human is a DEAD human!!"" ?

[SPOILER ALERT CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE MUTANTS] It is revealed in the story that the psychic mutants are human caricatures who literally worship the doomsday bomb (a bomb capable of destroying the entire planet). Evidently, human beings need something to worship even in a wholly devolved state -- truly, humankind is incurably religious. This may be a negative reflection on dead religion, which is the human attempt to connect with God ('religion' means ""to bind back""), but it certainly isn't a negative reflection on biblical Christianity, which concerns God Himself connecting with humanity through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the subsequent life-birthing power of the Holy Spirit. In any event, the perverted religious nature of the psychic mutants is nothing less than fascinating (albeit a bit laughable at times, e.g. ""the holy fallout""). [END SPOILER]

There are numerous great scenes and images, for example, the gorillas marching in the forbidden zone and the gigantic appearance of the revered ape Lawgiver with a bleeding face, ultimately collapsing into a desert inferno.

Some criticize that the first half of the story is merely an inferior repeat of the first film (astronaut crashlands, discovers that apes rule the planet and ends up in ape city), but -- you know what? -- it was great the first time around, why not experience it again with some slight nuances? (especially since ""Beneath"" was released 3 YEARS after the original). Hey, I admit that this section of ""Beneath"" isn't as great as the original, it's even kind of boring (that is, after seeing the first film), but WAIT till Brent and Nova escape ape city and discover the underground lair of the psychic mutants; the film becomes ultra-captivating from then on.

One beef I've always had with ""Beneath"" is that Leonard Rosenman's blaring score is mediocre compared to Jerry Goldsmith's original. It properly mimics the original but can't cut it. Why didn't they just re-use Goldsmith's score?

On a technical level, ""Beneath"" isn't nearly as good as the original due to obvious budget limitations. The subpar score is one example; another would be the all-too-obvious pull-over ape masks. But these are fairly minor cavils; they never prevented ME from wholly enjoying the flick. Still, I could see why some would some would view the film as 4/5 Stars or even 3.5/5 Stars for these reasons.

The climax is KILLER -- and I mean that literally -- as Brent ultimately finds Taylor and the gorillas invade the mutants' underground turf. Some great action entails and then... well, I can't give away the ultra-downer ending, can I? Let's just say that it should be appreciated by fans of death-obsessed bands like Type 0 Negative and My Dying Bride.

I always loved the ending; in its own way it's just as great as the climax of the original.

Needless to say, ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" is MANDATORY viewing. I wouldn't even take calls from film fans who don't have ""Beneath"" in his or her video library and hold it dear.",1188345600,,5537,4.984832069339111

342970,4,6301661710,"After the spellbinding revelation of the original Planet of the Apes, the sequel (and subsequent sequels in the landmark series) seemed critically doomed to suffer from substandard mediocrity in the wake of its apocalyptic aftermath, yet Beneath the Planet of the Apes endures as one of the most reverent science fiction films among faithful fans of the series.  A seriously flawed, yet brilliantly misunderstood masterpiece that remains as an important testament to behold. What could not be topped by Planet of the Apes' unsurpassable climax, could only be subverted by going beneath it... literally.

After Charlton Heston compromised with producers to only briefly reprise his role as Taylor in the sequel, James Franciscus takes the lead as Astronaut Brent.  While Franciscus gives a very strong and worthwhile performance, his character still suffers at the expense of being a poor-man's Taylor.  The first half of the film reiterates a lot of the exposition of the first film to bring Brent's character up to speed as he travels with the beautiful Linda Harrison as the mute slave Nova into the Forbidden Zone to find Taylor who mysteriously vanished into a mirage at the beginning of the film.  As Brent and Nova begin their descent beneath the subterranean caverns of a post-apocalyptic city, the film takes a much darker and cerebral turn that is both disturbingly bizarre and brutally nihilistic.  Brent, while under the telepathic mind-control of the under-dwelling society of mutated humans, shockingly tries to kill innocent Nova... twice.  The malevolent Mutants reveal themselves to be a cult of hideously deformed worshippers of an atomic bomb who give praise to its awesome destructive power at an eerie mass in their tabernacle as they prepare for the inevitable confrontation against the surface-dwelling Simians who have ruled over the planet ever since it was ravaged by the inferno of nuclear holocaust two millenia prior and the final battle for control of the Planet of the Apes will be determined by its prophetic Earth-shattering outcome.

Beneath the Planet of the Apes detonates with a shockwave of suspense that reached its apotheosis at the end of the first film and radiates unstoppably towards an inexorable conclusion at the end of the second. A brilliantly twisted and hauntingly cerebral sequel which may have proven itself to have been too intense and intellectual for its G-rated audience who were simply engrossed by the film's adventurous fantasy and captivated by the ape-like wonder of its characters.  It would be almost impossible today for a major studio to gamble on making what was considered to be a franchise-killing installment because of its powerfully subversive imagery and socio-political narrative which ironically gives Beneath its characteristically unique dynamic not only as a worthy and important follow-up to its classic predescessor, but a relevant and enduring testament of historic science fiction cinema.",1147651200,5,2969,5.313432835820896

It has naked apes in steam-baths! I was always shocked by the nihilistic and super-violent ending when I saw this film as a child and watching it again i am surprised to find it still rather abrupt and shocking--the climax is a stunner. The director, Ted Post, also directed the 2nd of the Dirty Harry films and he shows a Peckinpah-like ability to ""put the sting back in Death"".

What is amusing today is watching the film conclude, as it does, with James Franciscus pinned to a wall with bullet holes stitched across his chest and forehead and Chuck Heston clutching his bloody fingers to the ""button"" thus leading to the complete destruction of the ENTIRE PLANET...and then an old MPAA rating pops up immediately...telling you you have just witnessed a G-Rated film!

Things only start cooking when Brent and Nova discover the underground passage that leads to the city of the mutants. Not only is there a chilling series of scenes with the mutants using mind control to make Brent fight with Taylor and even try to strangle the sweet and gentle Nova, but intercut are some really effective scenes of the apes marching on the mutant city, and overcoming some interesting visual effects.

On balance, the movie fails to maintain a high level of excitement. Too much time is wasted early on. But the ideas presented in the mutant section are interesting. On the ape side, the balanced portrayal of Dr. Zaius as both a prejudiced old fool and an ape of integrity who cares for his people and believes in his Lawgiver sincerely is quite thought provoking.

James Franciscus is probably the worst thing about this movie. Not that he's a bad actor, just that his character is a lame carbon copy of Heston's Taylor. He has to make the same lame speeches about ""we blew it all up"" and he never even has a real love scene with Nova. Brent the astronaut is a real nowhere man.

(Note that this review is for this movie on DVD that was released by 20TH Century Fox.)

This movie is the sequel to the blockbuster  ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968).  Essentially, it is about an astronaut named Brent (James Franciscus) who is sent on a mission to find out what happened to the astronauts who were sent on a mission (the first mission) before him.

This sequel starts off with a flashback to the concluding 10 minutes of the original movie.  Doing this serves to remind the viewer what happened and for those who never saw the previous movie, to orientate them.  In the final moment of this flashback, we have the two main human characters of the original movie, Taylor the commander of the first mission (Charlton Heston) and the mute woman he befriends named Nova (Linda Harrison), ride off together on horseback to the ""Forbidden Zone"" (a vast and barren area on this ""unknown planet."").  It is here that Taylor mysteriously vanishes while exploring.  Nova, though horrified at Taylor's sudden disappearance, continues riding on horseback.

It is at this point that Brent's spaceship crash lands in the Forbidden Zone in the year 3955.  By an incredible stroke of luck, Brent encounters the mute Nova riding on horseback and he discovers that she knew Taylor.  Thus, Brent knows he's on the right track to finding him.

The movie at this point is essentially a condensed version of original movie and lasts for about 45 minutes.  Brent and Nova get captured by gorilla hunters and in captivity encounter the friendly chimpanzee scientists Cornelius (David Watson) and Zira (Kim Hunter) as well as the stern orangutan High Minister of Science and Religion Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evans).  Brent and Nova, however, escape and have to go underground (thus the word ""Beneath"" in the movie title) to evade the hunting gorillas.  It should be mentioned the gorillas in this movie have become more militaristic and want to expand their land ownership into the Forbidden Zone.  (Dr. Zaius will lead them.)  We get an idea of the gorilla's view of humans when a general of the gorilla military named Ursus (James Gregory) says:

""The only good human is a dead human.""

It is in this underground world that Brent and Nova meet human mutants who have special mind powers and worship ""a souvenir from the twentieth century.""  Brent and Nova finally meet Taylor (who was captured by these mutants).  As well, the apes have managed to penetrate this underground world.  This leads to a violent and somewhat surprising ending.

Those who have not seen the previous movie should enjoy this one.  It is filled with action and some good special effects.  James Franciscus gives, I feel, a solid performance.  Charlton Heston, even though he has limited time on-screen (about 25 minutes), also gives a good performance.

Viewers who have not seen the original movie might give this sequel a rating of (5) stars.

Those who have seen the previous movie will have some problems with this movie.  Here, I feel, are some of the main problems:

(1) Brent in this sequel landed on this planet in 3955.  According to the original movie, Taylor lands in 3978.  In other words, Brent landed 23 years too early when Taylor was still back on Earth!
(2) Zira and Cornelius have only bit parts in this sequel.  In the original movie, they had richer and more interesting parts.
(3) Roddy McDowall play Cornelius in the original movie.  Contrary to what the other reviews say, he does appear in this movie during the opening flashback scene.  As this sequel proceeds, David Watson takes over the role of Cornelius.  I found this distracting.  Since McDowall was not available, they should have written Cornelius' small part out of this movie.
(4) Dr. Zaius is not nearly the same stern and interesting high official he was in the original movie.  He's more like an intellectual gorilla in this movie.
(5) The amazing music of the original movie has been replaced with the more strained music of this sequel.
(6) The fantastic ape make-up of the original movie looks like it has been replaced with masks in this sequel.
(7) The late, great Rod Serling was a screenplay writer for the original movie.  You can tell he had no input in the writing of this sequel.
(8) In the opening credits, we're told that this sequel is based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle.  This is not absolutely correct.  There were no human mutants in Boulle's novel.

Those who previously viewed this movie might give this sequel a rating of (2.5) stars.

My rating of this movie will be an average of the two above ratings and will be shown below.

Finally, there is a sequel to this sequel called ""Escape from the Planet of the Apes""  (1971).  It is available on DVD.

In conclusion, this is a sequel that will be reacted too differently by different viewers.  Those who have not seen the original movie should enjoy this movie!!

rereleased in the ""GO APE"" festival. And as with the original this

sequel gets better with each viewing Also for a low budget film it

still had great set designs & the cast which includes most of it's

star players from the first on a minus note they lost McDowell's

""Cornelius"" but on the plus side you get James Gregory as ""General

Ursus"" who adds a great hammyness and for my money probably one of

more memorable characters in the series. Most follow ups rarely do

justice when matched up to thier precessor but I feel that the film

did answer the question of what was beyond the ""forbidden zone""

and you can't beat that final solution ending voiced by the one

I'm assuming that you three are the types who LOVED the new planet of the apes compared to Heston's real Planet of the Apes right?  Beneath is a damn good film, period.  I suppose you could give it 4.5 stars because it isn't as good as Part I, but COME ON! Beneath is a good film!!  If you like Planet of the Apes, I can not see how you won't enjoy this, the end is almost as good as the original one!  OK, enough.

Why did they turn Dr Zaius, Minister of Science, Defender of the Faith, Keeper of the Terrible Secret, from a sly and crafty player into a handwringing kvetch who marches with the brainless General Ursus to his grave beneath the planet. Didnt he worry what kind of human artifcats they might come across in the forbidden zone?

And why did they send someone to find Taylor?Im sure he would have been written off long gone without any contact. And what were the odds he would land in Taylors time and dimension rather then say  General Thades.

And advanced as the Mutants were they didn't seem to care that a fellow homo sapien had arrived in their city from earths past with full mental capacity and the ability to speak normally? All they cared about was the apes plans, they could have tapped the knowledge that Taylor and Brett brought with them so as not to call in the Alpha/Omega  resolution. But all they did was torture their minds. Well thats mutants for ya

Roddy Mcdowell was unable to appear as Cornelius in this one ape movie and im sure he is not sorry.

343123,4,6301661710,"I'll preface this review by saying 'Planet of the Apes' remains my favorite movie of all time (so far). And in an age where film has been reduced to terms like 'franchises', the prerequisite to even a sequel must remain 'is there a story to be told'? As both a writer and a member of the audience, I cherish the surprise but detest the fact that if I buy into it- someone in an office somewhere thinks I'll buy into 'Star Trek, Indiana Jones or Star Wars 46'.

Planet remains the classic- the next three sequels are a terrific companion piece, adapting its suggested history and fleshing it out. Avoid Battle. The stories have been told.

Beneath has always remained the maligned, misunderstood one and I want to address that in my review. Being the only actual sequel (the other 3 being prequels), has something to do with that. I personally think it rose to the challenge of following a classic admirably- thanks to the team of Jacobs, Dehn, Abrahams, Post and Franciscus.

The two most confused criticisms are Franciscus filling Heston's shoes, and that it somehow repeats half of the first film. Beneath is a film that I think you have to view a few times- sometimes that's the sign of a good book or film. In this case, I think it is.

Taylor was a cynical character. An absolute individual. A man escaping something in search of something different. Something better. It's the beauty of the first film and Heston's portrayal. It allows us to care and become involved in what awaits and is about to confront him.

Brent as the next character can't be afforded the same luxury. That would be repeating. Franciscus (who contributed much of what he said and did on screen), has to play an 'everyman'. An astronaut in search of another; following the orders of his mission. His remarks in the opening passage to both his dying skipper and Nova reflect that. He's trying to remain hopeful and find himself in a strange environment. It's only after encountering both the Ape society and then the Mutants, he ultimately caves to any sense of hope.

Watch Franciscus's subtle portrayal of that rather difficult task. Quite a performance and massively underated. Heston, who cited Franciscus as a very good actor, was wrong about Brent's part. Playing an 'everyman' is very difficult and I think Franciscus's lines gave us a good sense of the character in a story that had two society's to contend with, this time around. Thematically, it was more epic in nature.

As for his being taken by Nova back to ape city (the repetitious aspect cited)- very few seem to notice a marvelous thread being woven here: the opening flashback showing/teasing us about Taylor's strange disappearance (and really nicely handled visually), is what leads Brent (and us) back to a society now on the slide. Ape City is in a state of political change.

This is the point of this film. Zauis was the safeguard (perhaps) of the apes not repeating man's mistakes. Ursus's speech shows us military expansionism, a struggle for leadership, and sending an army to war ' in the name of faith', as he quotes their Lawgiver's words back to them.

The shadow spreads that the Apes will be no different, in the end, than man.

As Brent and Nova escape this, they fall into the hands of the Mutants- and this madness is heightened (to an uncomfortable but an unbelievably imaginative climax). The combination of faith flag waving, and the weird embracing of death culture is thought provoking (and unfortunately, still very timely).

There in lies the amazing thing about this film. It took the magnificant implication of the first film's ending, and offered a very dark, wonderous tone poem conclusion to it.

It tells its story and it has its own ideas, its own shape, scope and insights. It also had the guts via a science fiction film to state "" look what we do to one another in the name of faith or with the idea that God is somehow on 'someone's side'.

I also think that it wove a marvelous conclusion to Taylor's attempted escape of the world and mankind; to where it ultimately led him- and finally what it ultimately asked of him.

For those about to view or about to rewatch it- it's not Planet of the Apes. It wisely understood that story had been told.

It has its own story- however dark. It dared to be different and not a 'franchise set up'. It also has some real questions it asks, some marvelous performances (Franciscus and James Gregory as Ursus), some inspired direction and a very good score by Roseman. Oh yes, lest we foreget ... and Heston as Taylor.",1098835200,55,4539,4.670426065162907
343124,3,6301661710,"I too prefer the hairy apes to the mutant apes underground (remember humans are apes). The mutants are cold, hypocritical, unnecessarily violent, bizarre and those are their good points. Uexplained are points like :do they know they are living in the rewmains of what used to be the great city of Manhatten? I feel this movie is only a semi-rehash of the first (hey Taylor found no mutant apes in film one did he?). I wish to point out that war is ok'd in the Holy Bible so I am not entirely anti-war but the mutants apes lose me in sympathy when they try to kill Nova and Taylor and company when they have a perfectly strong jail cell to put them up alive in.

Where did she get that razor? from the monkies ha...) Brent undergoes the same basic treatment that Taylor received at the hands of the apes. Soon afterwards he escapes and finds that The Planet of the Apes is actually Earth when he stumbles onto the Greensboro subway. From there he meets a race of humanoids who worship the doomsday device and when they take off their faces look like un-masked Darth Vaders. Weirdness ensues.

The movie is however rather weak. The ending of the movie is somewhat unfulfilling. Well actually very unfullfilling. Brent's experience with the apes is just a rehash of the first movie. Overall the movie was just really boring and many of the events were not at all well explained. It was just a very mediocre movie and nothing compared to the first movie.

Though I would just like to point out some irony: Heston gets gunned down. Think about it.",1091232000,7,1046,4.648648648648648
343126,3,6301661710,"Sort of a silly follow-up to the brilliant 'Planet of the Apes', which if you read the Boulle novel you'll realize that for once the movie is actually better than the book. But as far as 'Beneath' goes, it's a must-have for the true Apes fan--if only for the fact that Taylor (Heston) and Zaius (Evans) are still principal characters. However, the story is pretty stupid, the script even worse, and the apes are no longer frightening predators but blundering fools whose skulls are too thick for their own good. This film lacks the dark and foreboding mood of the first 'Apes' film, and instead goes for schlock. Plus, the one glaring error in the beginning (for all you true 'Apes' fanatics) is that Brent (Franciscus) actually lands on the planet in 3955, which is 18 years BEFORE Talylor (Heston) and his crew even got there (3973). So Brent would have had a lot of free time on his hands. And the end is equally as flawed, as the Earth is destroyed by the human mutants--which would seem to sound the death knell for any more sequels. But apparently Zira and Cornelius escaped in Taylor's ship before the Earth was blown to bits (although there's no hint of this throughout the whole of Beneath), which leads to 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes'.
Be that as it may--'Beneath' is still terribly good fun!!",1087689600,3,1311,4.6068376068376065

343128,3,6301661710,"Beneath the Planet of the Apes has Nova and new astronaut Brent searching for Taylor, who is lost in the Forbidden Zone. They are only a few steps ahead of the gorilla army, who are assembling to eradicate what's left of humanity. Nova and Brent go underground into an old subway system, where they find a race of telepathic mutants worshipping an atomic bomb as a God.
After being captured by the mutants, Nova and Brent find Taylor himself is a captive. After almost killing each other because of the mutants' powers on their minds, they set out to stop the bomb from going up.
During the gorilla army assault on the mutants' lair, Brent and Nova are killed, and Taylor is seriously injured. The death of his only human companions make Taylor set off the bomb himself, destroying Earth for good.
None of the Planet of the Apes movies are known for happy endings, but this one is the darkest of them all. Taylor is back only as a cameo, and even that can't save this movie from a bad ending. What's the point of having a conflict between apes and man if the only resolution is everyone getting killed?
The overall concept for this movie wasn't bad: Finding a new civilization separate from the Ape culture, seeing more ruins from Humanity, etc. But the execution was dark and only got darker. If you want to watch a nice, relaxing movie, look elsewhere.",1080432000,2,1354,4.55327868852459
343129,3,6301661710,"There's something about ""Beneath"" that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The plot is pretty standard fare. Two astronauts (neither played by Charlton Heston) stumble upon that infamous monkey planet and discover that those pesky apes are STILL trying to wipe out the last traces of humanity. The costumes (not stunning in the prequel) look even more fake this time around. It's HARD to suspend your belief when the apes look like people running around in ape costumes!
Then we get to the subterranean scenes. Our surviving astronaut meets Nova (expertly played by a scantily-clad Linda Harrison) and a cult of nuke-worshipping mutants who sing praises to the ""almighty bomb"". There's this black dude who can make people kill each other if he shuts his eyes real tight and looks like he's taking a crap.
I am not making any of this up.
What saves the film at this point is a cameo by none other than Moses himself. The NRA chairman appears towards the end of the movie and he's as surly as ever. His manic performance takes ""Beneath"" up a notch.
But to say the ending is anti-climatic is, well, an understatement.
There seems to be no hurry to get the ""Planet of the Ape"" sequels out on DVD. I am not surprised. Each one gets progressively worse. See ""Return to..."" if you don't believe me. And the Tim Burton ""reimagining"" is just as awful.

343131,5,6301661710,"A lot of people don't give the movie much credit for what it really is. The film is actually quite entertaining and pure gold. Most people say that the first 45 minutes of the film was really just stalling and nothing happends. The truth is though that the 45 minutes was needed for the character to explore and get used to the planet as Taylor in the first film had and the cast is a knock-out with James Franciscus (who got a reputation for looking like a miniatre Heston but was more than that and) is a superb actor. Linda Harrison (could she be anymore beautiful???) as Nova, perhaps the ideal women we all want, move oner Raquel, Linda's stepping in! Kim Hunter (""STELLA!"") reprises her role and who could forget Charlton Heston (if only he had faith in sequels).
The plot is extravigent and one of the most imaginative films I have ever seen, with an intelligant race race of telepathic humans with what lies beneath there masks, and a fight scene between Franciscus and Heston. Superb and all hats go off to Nova, the fairest of them all. Although the ending is among the most disturbing I had ever seen, it deservs its place in moviedom.

343212,5,6301661710,"Beneath the Planet of the Apes is the second movie in the series and my personal favorite.  Probably the darkest of all five movies, the story begins with Taylor and Nova riding through the Forbidden Zone where the first one left off.  Taylor mysteriously disappears, but Nova is able to find Brent, the only survivor of the crew sent to rescue Taylor.  After seeing Ape City, Brent and Nova go into the Forbidden Zone where they find an underground city of mutants who worship an atomic bomb as their god.  Meanwhile, the Apes are planning an attack on the Forbidden City.  The story is very good and also examines the prejudices of the Apes that are so similar to the ones of the humans they so despise.  This is not the happiest movie, especially the ending, but it is still a great movie and the ending does fit.
 James Franciscus plays Brent, the astronaut who survives the crash, and plays it very well.  His performance is similar to that of Charlton Heston's in the first one, and at some points they even look alike.  Charlton Heston does make a brief cameo in the beginning before disappearing and then comes back in the last twenty minutes to help Brent.  Kim Hunter reprises her role of Zira while David Watson takes the role of Cornelius instead of Roddy McDowall who was busy working on a different project at the time.  Maurice Evans is great again as Dr. Zaius with James Gregory giving an excellent role as General Ursus, the leader of the armies bent on destroying anything they come across in the Forbidden Zone.  Linda Harrison is gorgeous as Nova, and she even gets to say something in this one.  Fans of the series will love this movie even if the budget was less than the first one, which is very obvious in some scenes.  The Planet of the Apes is offered on DVD but each individual film is not offered seperately.  Too bad, because these are great films.

Still, that ending!  High Mass for a nuclear missle!  Preformed, no less, by congregation of bizzaro burn victims in robes!

343214,5,6301661710,"Beneath the Planet of the Apes is the typical sequel that has to follow the plot and hold the same standards as its phenomonally successful original. ""Beneath,"" as I will continue to call it, does it's job better than most. The plot is well thought out, the new characters, Nova, Taylor, and Dr. Zaius hold up very well, and it keeps many of the original film's aspects with it.
James Franciscus may have had the most difficult acting challenge. Since Charlton Heston did not want a sequel, and agreed to do only two cameos, Franciscus had to fill in the main character slot, and give a performance as strong as Heston's. He does a really good job at it. The main character, Brent, is very believable and obviously has a devotion to friends. His quest to find Taylor goes a lot farther than most humans would care to go. Brent's character is also helped by the fact he is new, so has no risk of not being like his past characterizations.
Ursus, the gorilla commander, is played by James Gregory. His performance is everything you would want out of a POTA gorilla. Dr. Zaius remains as the only original ape character to not have an alerted personality. He remains the same type of hard-headed, aristocrat who is the sole witness to Earth's past. Taylor's character is no longer misanthropic, but then again he was like that since the end of the first film.
Now here come the problems. The budget on this film was obviously cut. The exact price was $ 3,000,000. That budget would be about 80 or 90 million dollars in today's blockbusters. This resulted in the fact that not all the qualified make-up artists returned. Zira now has somewhat of a double-chin and a catfish-like appearance, and Zaius's design is not as...aristocratic. Corneilius looks different, but that's becaus Roddy McDowall was directic a film in London and the part had to go to David Watson. Speaking of chimpanzees, Zira and Corneilius's personalities are too altered. Zira is now headstrong and tempermental, and her husband is no longer a reluctant hero. After Paul Deihn wrote the story, Michael Wilson should have been hired to re-write the script, almost word-for-word, but keep the characters the same. Also, Ted Post was a good director, but brining back Franklin Schaffner would have been better.
This film is very good, and does a great job at following the success of the original. In the plot, Brent crashlands on Earth following Taylor's path, and finds Nova (Linda Harrison). Taylor is lost in the Forbidden Zone, and with Zira's help, Brent goes out to find him. The apes declare war on a mutant race of humans with faces from Graves Anatomy, and Taylor and Brent must save the entire globe, apes, and humans.",1042761600,11,2695,4.748400852878465
343215,4,6301661710,"I actually like this sequel to ""Planet of the Apes"" as much as the original. ""Beneath"" makes up for what ""Planet"" lacked and vice versa. For instance, ""Beneath"" has a lot more action, especially toward the end; ""Planet,"" on the other hand,  has a much better musical score, which is integrated with the material superiorly (why didn't they just use the same score for ""Beneath""?).
""Beneath"" is just a great sci-fi adventure flick. An astronaut lands on the ape planet, makes contact with a primitive babe who knew Taylor, and then embarks upon a quest to find him -- leading first to the ape city and then to the ""forbidden zone,"" a holocaust-ruined desert area where psychic mutants dwell.
The ending is killer -- and I mean that literally -- as the ape army invades the mutant's underground turf. Some serious action entails, and then... (now I can't give away the ultra-downer ending, could I? Let's just say it [the ending] will be much enjoyed by fans of Type O Negative).

The scene drags on for what seems like 30 minutes).  Then, we get lots of horse chasing and running away from apes which seems to last about another 30 minutes.  Finally, in the most exciting part of the movie, we get to see underground New York.  This is the only effective scene in the movie.  After that we are introduced to mutant humans with no explanation as to how they go there, what they are, and why they are.

Also, Charlton Heston gets little more than a cameo as the astronaut Taylor. However, the new main character is a pretty good replacement, and even looks like him to boot!

343281,3,6301661710,"""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" is the second and most whacked-out film in the ""Apes"" series. It's somewhat successful due to sheer psychedelic madness, despite a budget cut that forces some of the players into ill-fitting and really dopey-looking masks.
 James Franciscus works hard as Brent, the human this go-around. He gets a bit deranged by his experiences, but recovers in the bizarro third act where he reunites the lovely Nova (Linda Harrison) with Taylor (Charlton Heston again) beneath a ruined New York while the whole ape army storms the place.
 Unfortunately, this movie began the series' flirtation with camp and heavy-handed social commentary. You get to hear a gorilla general (effectively played by James Gregory) preach genocide, and witness a mini-recreation of the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention right there on the streets of Ape City, as chimp peaceniks try a little nonviolence; the gorilla police don't take to hippies, either.
 Still, it's a lot of fun and features some funky hallucinations and freaky special effects- especially when the mutant humans pull off their masks and reveal their skinless faces while worshipping an atomic bomb. And not just any atomic bomb- but a special one that'll destroy all life on earth. Well, you get the idea. Check it out and have some trippy fun some night when you don't have anything better to do.

343284,5,6301661710,"This movie is a very good second film in the Planet of the Apes series. In this movie, the whole climax is that of total annihilation of earth. This  in itself is a great plot for a movie, but this film pulls it off great. I  did find some of the plot points confusing, like they didn't really explain  how the mutant humans came into being, maybe that was the ""Holy  Fallout"" they were talking about. Besides that, I really loved this  movie.",966556800,,443,4.289156626506024
343285,4,6301661710,"IThis movie was good, not as good as the first but good.  I would have liked to have seen more of Heston.  I can't understand why the humans underground took ""Tayler"" as the ememey.  He was human after all.  Still it was good",952819200,,225,4.162790697674419
343286,4,6301661710,"""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" is not as good as the original, but I believe it's better than many fans give it credit for.  People have mentioned that several of the ape masks look phony in this picture.  Well,  that's probably because ""Beneath"" had a budget half of the first  movie. I do agree it would have been nice to see more of Heston, but he  didn't want to do this sequel in the first place, so at least we get to see  him a little.  I like ""Beneath"" because the plot is far more  believable than the next 3 sequels, and the Brent character is sympathetic  and likeable.  In fact, this should have been the last film of the series,  but 20th Century Fox figured they could still make money off of this story.  So, they came up with three more sequels, each with plots more and more  unbelievable, but still entertaining.",947980800,,832,4.324675324675325
343287,2,6301661710,"As brilliantly original as its predecessor was, this movie is crass, features a bizarre and hard-to-swallow premise and some outlandish special effects.  It lacks the rich characters of the original and seems to  understand half-way through that the only way to end the bloody thing is,  well, to END it.  Don't get me wrong -- I love the original PLANET OF THE  APES and have great affection for several of its sequels, but I would be  steering you in the wrong direction if I did not tell you -- skip this one;  stick with No. 1 and No. 3, they are infinitely more considered.  It seems  as if the film-makers, surprised by the outrageous artistic and commercial  appeal of the original, had to quickly throw some product out there before  we lost interest.",945388800,9,759,4.631578947368421
343288,5,6301661710,"Some after the events of the first 'PLANET OF THE APES', the climax of which is repeated frame for frame at the beginning of this sequel, another set of astronauts arrive on the far-future Earth that is the titular planet. This time it's Brent (James Franciscus) who survives the crash landing and learns that evolved simians have taken over the wolrd, post-apocalypse. After hooking up with Nova (Linda Harrison), the mute, fur bikini-clad beauty who spent the first film being squired by astronaut Taylor(Charlton Heston), Brent confers with Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (David Watson), the ape scientists whose adherence to scientific principles makes them friendly to the possibility of intelligent human life. Something of a military coup has taken place among the apes, who dispatch an army to the desolate ""Forbidden Zone"" where Taylor has coincidentally disappeared. With the apes and the humans both rooting about in the ruins of 20th Century civilization, it's only a matter of time before they all find out what happened to the other survivors of the nuclear holocaust.

  Trivia (from imdb.com):(1)The only film in the original series of five that does not star Roddy McDowall. Roddy McDowall was unable to appear in this film because he was commited to another project. He can, however, be spotted briefly in the opening dialogue, even though another actor playes the role of Cornelius later in the film. McDowall is often pictured on video and DVD packaging for this film.(2)James Franciscus was cast as Brent due to his resemblance to Charlton Heston.(3)This was the first appearance of Natalie Trundy in the ""Apes"" series. She is the only person to play both a human and an ape in the series.",943920000,,1711,5.060283687943262
