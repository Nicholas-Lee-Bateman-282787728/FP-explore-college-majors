8253906,5,B00141598C,"What a good find. True the quality was not all that perfect, but there are movies out there from the '70's and 80's that are of poorer quality.  The acting was over the top like most from those early years, but, it was a good story. Good and evil, it had everything you come to expect from the 1930's with, the happy ending. I wish others would realize what a privilege it is to even be able to view old films like these. I think it's a gem.  Thanks for making it available.",1378857600,5,474,4.086021505376344
8253907,4,B00141598C,"The quality wasn't great but it really wasn't too bad in my opinion. I've watched some old movies that I could barely understand at times, possibly due to my hearing loss. And some with very grainy video, or other problems. I can't judge the quality of the restorers work since I don't know what the quality of the original was.  But I'll say the movie was easy to watch and I understood every word (unusual for me). The acting was very decent and the plot was good for this era. Almost every old movie has a few plot problems and this was no exception but they were minor. I thought I knew the end and was wrong. I have a large number of old movies and while I wouldn't spend time searching for this one, I wouldn't pass it up for the right price. The story line was more heart tug than mystery or action. I'm not a fan of heart tug movies or romances but this was worth my time to watch. I often watch old movies multiple times. I would watch this one again. But, it'll be later on if at all.",1371600000,,994,4.123711340206185
8253908,1,B00141598C,"I'm getting very angry at some of these companies that are releasing very poor Quality DVDs.
""I'd Give My Life"" could have been very enjoyable if they spent a little time fixing it up.  In some areas the movie goes dark and light and dark and light.  It gets very annoying.  There's crackle and popping sounds through out the movie.",1203465600,8,332,4.5
