3562899,5,B001F2U6ZG,"Seeing Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle was a fantastic experience that makes me crave more anime on Blu-Ray.  The images look so crisp, high res, etc.  In fact after seeing Tsubasa on Blu-Ray and then going back to standard definition it was like looking at two different things.  The blu-ray looked crisp and seemed to have more vibrant colors.

The boxset comes with three discs, two inside of one DVD case and then one on a separate case.  There are about 8 episodes on the first two discs and then the final disc has the remaining episodes as well as the special features.

Special features include a textless version of the opening song Blaze and the ending song.  There are also cast auditions of the main characters and Yuko.  Finally there are links on the blu-ray to key episodes that describe the world or the characters.

All in the package is a great deal and Im so glad I was able to see it on Blu-Ray.

Tsubasa is a fun and adventurous anime with characters that one would come to love and actually care about.  The elemental powers in the show makes it a fantastic, nearly science fiction, experience that will be sure to please people who watch. The only criticism is that at times it can feel slow however, the action will pick up and the suspense that it carries one to watch each and every episode.

BTW:  The boxset contains the entire first season, that is, 26 episodes.",1260230400,,1387,4.544354838709677
3562900,5,B001F2U6ZG,"I have loved Tsubasa from the very beginning and devoured each and every disc as soon as I got my hands on them.

I highly recommend the Tsubasa Chronicles for anyone that loved Chobits or any of the other Excellent series by Clamp that have nothing to do with giant robots and outer space or monsters for monsters sake. Some may say the characters ambled through some of the episodes but that is the beauty of this series. The companions are searching for the Princess's memory feathers. They don't know if the next world will be friendly or dangerous, and there are no sign posts pointing the way. They have to depend on each others strengths and at times weaknesses, to find there way. Each and every episode has something new and different to say even if the format is the same, but you have to pay attention. They are not out to slay a dragon or save the world. They are all trying to help the Princess. I would love to see more episodes of Tsubasa and would gladly buy each and every disc.

I read that the Tsubasa Manga was ending or had ended.  I would like to ask the talented folks at Clamp to consider another season or three of Tsubasa beyond the Manga.  I considered it that good....

I don't fall in love with Anime series that often !!!  I LOVE TSUBASA !!!",1260230400,,1271,4.341772151898734
3562901,5,B001F2U6ZG,This is a must have series! Storyline at first seems a bit loose and confusing but as the episodes unfold it reveals an interesting plot with great characters and awesome voice overs that I recognized almost immediately from other great animes. This is definitely one the best anime's out there and I can't wait to see the next season.  I'd recommend this to all anime fans!,1259625600,,374,4.666666666666667
3562902,5,B001F2U6ZG,"I really enjoy this series and if the Blu-ray version actually comes out I will get it, but Funimation had a release date for this months ago to be released on Blu-ray and it never happened.

The story is about a boy who knows a princess and both of them have this secret love for eachother. The princess decides that she wants to tell the boy and asks him to meet him at some ruins, but things go bad. She ends up losing all of her memories which are in the form of feathers and the boy goes on a quest to get them all back. So ends up meeting the dimensional witch who for a fee will send him to where he needs to go and hopefully find her feathers. In his case the fee is that no matter how many he collects, so no matter how much of her memory returns to her, she will never remember him. Two other characters go along with him and a crazy adventure begins. (This is a rough summary since I am trying to keep out potential spoilers).

Is it worth having on Blu-ray versus DVD is probably the main question. I say yes do to it's rich color detail and artwork. The story is captivating, full of fantasy and adventure. It is fairly close to the original manga work done by Clamp who wrote many popular stories such as Magic Knight Rayearth, Angel Links, Chobits, X, and xxxholic just to name a few. This story to me, and I really enjoy the works by Clamp, is just far superior in comparison to the other stories they have written. It also has many of the characters from the different stories in it and for those who like Card Captor Sakura a very important character is based off of her. While it might not be one of my top three animes it is in my top three for a must see on Blu-ray. Out of the 140 anime titles I own, I would love to watch this in the way I believe it was ment to be watched.",1253059200,7,1797,4.059154929577465
3562903,5,B001F2U6ZG,"I loved Sakura, Cardcaptor.  I had gotten it expecting rather similar, so at first was slightly put off by what seemed to be lesser artwork and badly rewittern characters halfway through the first episode.  However by the end of the sencond episode I was hooked.  I love this series and cannot wait for the second season to come out.  As soon as I got over it not being Sakura part 2, it really took off.  And I really enjoy spotting the other characters from other Clamp series that make cameo appearences.",1246320000,,507,4.527472527472527
3562904,5,B001F2U6ZG,"This is another winner from the CLAMP team - who brought the anime nation wonderful titles such as Magic Knight Rayearth, XXXholic, Cardcaptors, Chobits, X, and many more. As soon as i found out Tsubasa was from CLAMP i knew it was another addicting series that was about to unfold.
Many anime fans will know Sakura from Cardcaptors and this is another series that deals with this character.
During a ritual of some kind Sakura accidentally loses the shards to her heart that are now scattered through time. So her semi-boyfriend Syaoran must travel through time & space to recover them.
This sends the duo on many battles through time, which kinda reminds me of Dragon Ball Z in that they are trying to retrieve something. This is a really great series and unfortunately only lasted about two seasons. I think this box set is heavily over-priced but definitely worth picking up when it's on sale.",1228867200,2,897,4.756410256410256
3562905,3,B001F2U6ZG,"As fans of the manga know, Tsubasa goes through several different stages.  This set of it's animated version corresponds to the getting-to-know-the-characters stage which often played out as a shounen tournament series.

A quick briefer for those unfamiliar with the story:  The memories of a teenage, alternate universe version of Cardcaptor Sakura's title character are scattered into different dimensions in the form of feathers, and she will die if enough of them are not retrieved.  Under the auspices of xxxHOLiC's Yuko, her true love Syaoran is joined by two adult guardians - a ninja named Kurogane and a magician named Fai, who are also traveling for different reasons - as they jump across dimensions to complete the task, meeting other alternate universe versions of CLAMP characters along the way.  But as Holic fans know, Yuko must always extract a price whether she would or no - and unbeknownst to Sakura, the price Syaoran has paid is the permanent loss of her memory of their relationship.

Tsubasa's main strength is the relationships which eventually develop between the four leads rather than the feather quest of the week or CLAMP cameos, which of course means that the inital arcs in which the characters haven't yet become close will probably never be considered among it's best.  It also doesn't help that the majority of the padding material common to long running manga-based anime is focused here on the quest and guest stars rather than the extremely engaging four leads. Still, this set includes hints of the character development to come as Syaoran slowly earns Kurogane's respect and both kids - but Sakura in particular - start to bring out Fai's protective instincts.  Indeed, a critical scene much beloved by fans between Kurogane and Fai during the Oto arc which cemented their relationship and gave the story unexpected teeth as Kurogane first realized there was something very wrong with Fai might actually have come out even better here.  Two one-episode filler arcs are also respectable and fit into these early stages quite well, which isn't always the case with fillers.  Also of note is a beautiful score which is one of the series' strongest assets.

Some viewers might not have the patience for Tsubasa to reach it's full potential - that won't come until the material covered by the OVA following Season 2 - and these arcs are somewhat inconsistent with some being better than others.  It's best to take this set for what it is: a basically fun romp you might enjoy as long as you don't get your expectations up too high yet.",1228780800,12,2570,4.937354988399072

3562911,5,B001F2U6ZG,"Clamp does it again with a wonderful breathtaking series, family friendly, and enough action and comedy to keep the adults happy. Clamp takes characters from many of their stories and puts them together in this heart warming series of strangers traveling from different worlds with different agendas working together on a common goal, but facing their own paths. Each character is complex yet easy to identify with. Highly recommended, specially if you are a clamp fan, or Card Captor Sakura, XX Holic, Ect.

3562927,5,B001F2U6ZG,"When I first watched this anime, it was in Japanese dub. I have only cried four times watching anime, and two of the times was watching Tsubasa. This show holds a special place in my heart as one of those unappreciated animes who hardly receives as much recognition being as awesome as it is. It's a show with a sad and simple premise, but in the end you learn there is so much more than just dimensions and feathers. The only complaint I have (as most people do) is that, in my own personal opinion, the English dub isn't as good as the Japanese. Everyone's opinion is different, but this show is simply fantastic and inspires me every time I watch it.
Buy it! It's cheaper than most anime!!",1399852800,2,692,4.372093023255814

Don't let that keep you from saving so much money while getting the same fantastic anime series. That way, you save more to buy even more great series with. ;)

3562933,1,B001F2U6ZG,"I saw the first few episodes of this at a convention and fell in love with the storyline. Season one does a great job of developing the characters and laying down a wonderful framework for what was going to be one of my top three favorite anime series of all time (and I watch a lot of anime). However, Season two stalls to an end with hoards of unfinished plots and the OVAs absolutely destroy the storyline without the satisfaction (no matter how painfully disgusting) of finishing the story, making this entire series a frustrating waste.

How could something with such wonderful characters, music score and poetic storyline get destroyed so thoroughly? I can't even relate how frustrating it was to see such an awful finish. I'm seriously considering throwing this entire series in the garbage because I have no desire to watch it again due to the offensively disjointed ending, no matter how enchanting the first season was.

So, when I saw this S.A.V.E. edition available at such a cheap price, I was exstatic! However, despite being a much cheaper price than the regular DVDs, this still had all the bonus features, and was in excellent condition. It plays smoothly, and has all the wonderful things you'd expect. A great dub, Vic Mignogna, Clamp, and gorgeous music by Yuki Kajiura. I have to admit the only dissappointment is that they studio got extremely lazy with the animation at times, sometimes showing still images rather than real animation, but the parts that are well animated look great.

And the love story is just bittersweet. Syaoran's beloved is within his arms' reach but he cannot grab her because she has would never, ever remember what their relationship was like before she lost her memories.

This is another great animation by CLAMP. Like all the other CLAMP animes this story has great animation and music, as well as a really good story line. The main voice actors are Chris Sabat, Jason Liebrecht, Vic Mignogna, Monica Rial, and Carrie Savage. So the voice acting is very good. This anime has a very different plot that is emotional and touching. All the different worlds the character travel to are interesting and magical. So it feels like there are a bunch of mini stories going on inside the main one. All the characters pasts and reasons for taking the journey are also covered in pretty much detail.

3562949,4,B001F2U6ZG,"The question of whether to recommend Tsubasa is a complicated one.  I'll be honest, if the set wasn't so cheap, I would have given it only 3 stars.

The problem mostly comes down to the fact that I've read the manga.  And it's better.  It's better in so many ways.  The anime was in the transition filled with... filler, and it throws the pacing way off.  That seems to be the number one complaint.  Of course, my biggest problem is probably the fact that they pronounce one of the main character's name wrong in the dub, which for me ruined what might have been a respectable performance.  But anyway, that's just me, and maybe I'm a snob, or maybe I've just seen so much that I know better.  And that's my point.

The anime has it's place too.  It's a terrific gateway anime... especially for a younger audience (people who doesn't know better... who doesn't know how a Japanese name is supposed to sound).  Got a little brother (or sister)?  Show him this and he'll be a fan.  I have no doubts.

So yeah.  Do I recommend the anime?  Really it depends who's asking.  Older audiences might just want to check out the superior manga (CLAMP manga are always better), but this is also something that a younger or inexperienced audience can really get into.  Of course, given the relatively inexpensive price tag, it's not that hard to say go ahead, pick it up if you really want.",1342742400,,1377,4.479838709677419

I can understand the reason for the series being set up the way it was and a search for the pieces of a person's soul thru many worlds is a good story idea, but... This only works if the series and any additional series have an ending in mind and not just a greedy person looking for a power and manipulating the heroes. The first series isn't all that bad, but it sets of a ""never ending"" search idea which I had trouble with. At least a search needs a certain goal. Like, let's say, how many feathers are in her soul, or maybe more about when the search reaches an end. You get some of this but not enough. Plus you don't get enough on the villians either. I generally like the series and the adventures were great enough.

This Blu-ray set has a number of issues with the video. The images are blurry, the lines are fuzzy, colors washed out, everything as a glow around it, there is noticeable gradient banding, and artifacting during many scenes. If you own the DVDs, stick with them as they are the best quality available.

If you want a HD version of this anime wait for the official release from the studio, not some cheap Funimation weekend project. I ended up returning this because I am not going to pay for this horrible mess of a release.

I added a screenshot to the images section to show how bad this release is. Make sure to look at it full size, as it naturally looks better at a smaller size. Also the screenshot was not altered in any way from the Blu-ray source.

Also don't buy this set, go for the collection if you are going to get it.",1297900800,2,1035,4.431578947368421
3562959,5,B001F2U6ZG,My son has become addicted to the book series.  I bought this for him for Christmas and he loves it.  He wasn't happy to hear them pronounce some of the names differently than he had been.  I'm not much of a follower myself.  I don't know which came first.  But the book and the dvd seem pretty identical.,1293494400,,305,4.189655172413793
3562960,5,B001F2U6ZG,"Tsubasa Reservoir Chonicle Season 1 is fantastic. It really impressed me! The only thing that made me sad it that Fai doesn't say Hyuu like he does in the subbed version :( But other than that I enjoyed it!

Season 1 comes with the first 26 episodes. The last DVD had me at the tip of my seat!! And once this season ends, it makes you want more and more of Tsubasa! You'll never have enough! CLAMP, I think, has really outdone themselves with Tsubasa! Please! If your a CLAMP fan, or just an anime fan, you HAVE TO HAVE Tsubasa!",1292198400,,528,4.227722772277228

She absolutly loved it, and I got it used and it still came in great codition. She really loved it. And I myself have Season 1 of Tsubasa (Not Viridian Collection) and the Viridian one is just the same as the regualr one pretty much. Anyway, I think any anime fan should get Tsubasa.",1292198400,,443,4.162790697674419

3562964,5,B001F2U6ZG,"I owned the original DVD release of Tsubasa when it was released by Funimation. While I enjoyed the series on my older TV, the video didn't look so great when I purchased and watched it on my 42 inch Plasma TV. When it was announced that the series was coming out on Bluray, I immediately purchased a copy and I have to say that the picture is absolutely gorgeous at 1080p. In addition, this series is a bargain at $30 at amazon, while the original series cost me well over $100 dollars. If you have a HD TV and a Bluray player, get this series. You won't be disappointed.",1260403200,6,572,4.256880733944954

Id say a show worth watching and Owning.

Overall Rating 3.5/5
A strong group of characters travel between many dimensions to gather the feathers of Sakuras memories.  This show has a 2nd season and an OVA that continue the story.

This a tie-in show for most of studio Clamps works.  Many of shows characters are either directly referenced or remade.  Watching all the other shows isn't necessary but adds to the backgrounds a bit.  xxxHolic season 1 before Tsubasa would be a plus though.
Anyhow, its a good adventure story.  The characters all from different dimensions end up traveling together.

Theme Songs 4/5
This season has a solid, good opening and ending.  Mostly fast paced, I didn't skip them.

Ending 3/5
NO spoilers, the ending is to be continued.  The 2nd season and OVA bring the end.
Its still recommended.",1469491200,,854,4.820689655172414

8300766,5,B001F2U6ZG,"From the creators of the xxxHolic anime series comes Tsubasa Reservior Chronicles season 1. Here is my review :) please enjoy!

Characters and Plot: (minor spoilers only) The Kingdom of Clow is a desert world filled with sand and wind. There is where we meet Syaoran (pronoced Sa-ow-ron) a young archeologist who is friends with the princess of the kingdom. Princess Sakura is friends with Syaoran. They are on a date per say, falling inlove Sakura said she will tell Syaoran that she loves him but she is interupted and needs to go back to the castle so it would have to wait. Later that night while working at the ruins Syaoran sees princess Sakura who seems to be in a trance. When she goes deeper into the ruins Syaoran tries to stop her the floor lights up and then Sakura's memories fly out from her body in the form of feather. Mystfied at this Syaoran is met by the ruleing king's advisor and priest Yukito tells Syaoran if he really cares for princess Sakura he will travel to another demention. Confused because demention traveling didn't seem possible in this world Syaoran and Sakura are travling to another demention. While that is happen in a completely different world called Japan (yes the whole world is Japan) we meet a warrior called Kurogane who is being forcefully transported to another demention by the ruler Princess Tomoyo because she wishes for him to get stronger and except he wishes not to go and is whisked away agents his will angerly. Mean while in a third demention we meet Fai D. Flowright (pronouced F-I-ed, Flouright) a wizard who is sending him self to another demention because he captured an evil wizard and is running away so he won't be cought. So when all 3 demention travelers get to the demention they are sent to, they end up on Earth outside the shop of  Yko Ichihara. (or as I call her ""Yuko the witch"") (the same Yko Ichihara from xxxHolic series because it is a cross over series). Syaoran tells Yuko the story of why he is there, and she finds out his wish is to get Sakura all her memories back. Kurogane wishes to go back to his home land. Fai wishes to keep runining so the evil wizard won't catch him. Yuko sees this an oppertunity to grant them all their wish. For a price. Kurogane's compensation for his wish to return to his homeland is his magical Sword. Fai's compensation is his tattoo's which gives him his powers for the magic he does. Syaoran's compensation is the relationship and any personal memories he had with Sakura so Sakura will never truly know who Syaoran is. When they all agree to travel to different demensions to get their wish granted Yuko gives them the companion of Mokona Modoki. What is a Mokona you ask? Well you count them one Mokona two Mokona but then you stop after that because their is only two Mokona's! Honestly its a tiny bunny like creature that can travel demenions and has other little tricks along the way. They have the White Mokona which can demension jump when they are finnished with collecting the memory feather from each world. Now Sakura, Syaoran, Fai and Kurogane all travel to different worlds and times (like the past, present and future) all to find Sakura's memories feathers so she can regain the memories of which she lost.

Pros: The story is written well at times. The characters are all memorable. The fight scenes are amazing. The comedy is here and there at times. The case holds all 4 dvds which has episodes 1 to 26 which comprise of the whole first season uncut and unedited. Because this series is made from Clamp who made and wrote xxxHolic they have many times crossed over into the Tsubasa series here with Yuko being the most shown from xxxHolic. Yuko's english dub voice is done by Colleen Clinkenbeard who did the voice is xxxHolic which is nice to hear. Mokona's voice is the same from xxxHolic but the white Mokona is shown to be more a girl version then black Mokona. It's nice to see this anime how the characters go to different worlds where sometimes magic excists and some magic can never be done but technology is ruling. Some characters from previous worlds they visit return but may not be as friendly as they were before, or as evil as they was. Some characters are shown in different worlds but only the main 4 characters have seen them in alter worlds and know bits about their personailties. As Fai puts it ""different people but they have the same soul"".

Cons: What problems I have most with season 1 here is way how villians are written in. Some worlds have one time villians which I don't mind. Sometimes villians from one world appear in another world as friends to the main 4 Characters. But what gets this on the con list is during some scenes it is shown from another world that a man called Fei-Wang Reed and his assissant Xing Huo talk to eachother. Fei-Wang keeps talking about how they are manipulating Mokona to send the group to worlds with feather of his chooseing. Also some other recouring villians keep popping up but it is very (in my oppion) poorly written in and they never say what their big plan is or what they want with Sakura's feathers. Another ""Con"" I have with season 1 is Fai Flowright, his past is very much a mystery. Sakura's and a bit of Syaoran's past is shown. Kurogane's is told a little but but shown more in season 2 but Fai's is a complete mystery, running from evil wizard okay I get that. Anything else writers want to add? Nope! okay moveing on!

Over all: I liked this series alot! it is amazing! there are some cross overs from other major anime's shown later in the show but you need to watch to find out! Please read my review for season 2 of Tsubasa reservior chronicles comming soon!! and buy this series!!!",1434585600,2,5697,4.543330087633885
