8431845,2,B004JBEE4E,"There's no question these are valuable film clips, but to call is ""Tape Dance History,"" and then charge $50 for it, is disingenuous. There's nothing here you couldn't find a reasonable facsimile of on YouTube.

Save your money.",1464307200,,227,4.973684210526316
8431846,4,B004JBEE4E,"They were gifts to my niece and sister who have yet to look and listen to them, but it is great to see a huge variety of music and video that is available and to get it within easy reach.",1386979200,2,187,3.7
8431847,5,B004JBEE4E,This is not a history of tap dance but rather a series of excerpts from early filmed tap dances.  There is a nice narrative the gives background to each of the excerpts.  The images are first rate.  The sound is servicable.  I have seem some of the excerpts elsewhere but many are new to me.  At 45 minutes it is rather short considering the wealth of material that must be left in the collection this DVD was taken from.,1378080000,7,421,4.2784810126582276
