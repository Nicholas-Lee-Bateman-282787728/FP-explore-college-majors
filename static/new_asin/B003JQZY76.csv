Seth was in SEXPOT-a 3D cult hit from Theasylum.
In his second feature he is the best friend of a guy who looks alot like Val Kilmer,When HE looked like Val Kilmer !
This comedy is pretty good and alot of scenes are stolen by Charlene Tilton and her scenery chewing.
There are strippers,girl on girl scenarios,and alot of funny spots.
This is classic NATIONAL LAMPOON feel to it and Naomi Selfman (script) and Mark Quod (director) delivered a funny 90 minutes.",1279238400,9,481,4.670588235294118
4131349,4,B003JQZY76,"Okay- as a b-movie fan, I immediately check out whatever The Asylum releases..... Of their recent foray into sex comedies, this is by FAR the best.

The key here is the cast - they are completely game, and put more effort into making this a good film then it probably deserves. There's clearly a lot of improv going on, and it works. Also - the plot makes sense, and there's a certain amount of heart here that doesn't exist in similar movies by the same studio.

I'd suggest a rental. The usual dirty jokes/nudity are present, but there's also some genuinely funny moments, and an ending that actually works and makes you feel good. Again - the cast sells it.",1363910400,2,660,4.491666666666666
4131350,4,B003JQZY76,"I've seen a few cheerleader themed comedies and this is my favorite. It is funny, especially when the horndog maintenance guy was onscreen. Everything he does and says is sex-related and filthy, and I loved it! There is also a good amount of nudity in this thing, probably more than the American Pie movies. Well, maybe with the exception of American Pie: The Naked Mile. If you like sex movies, you should see #1 Cheerleader Camp. It's funnier than Bring It On and Fired Up!",1362614400,2,475,4.6
4131351,1,B003JQZY76,"Well I dunno what movie the folks that gave this 5 stars saw, but all I saw was garbage. If I rent a B looking cheerleader movie with unknown bimbo actresses & some girls azz on the cover I expect to see lots of gratifying T&A, not really expect it to have much of a storyline, just lots of good T&A runnin around all over the place. Well, this movie failed miserably. What was supposed to be a Porky's version of ""Bring It On"" was more like a homo-chick flick instead. There were lots of breast, i'll give it that but I was expecting to see some good full frontal & the girls in the movie that I thought were the hottest never took off a d@mn thing. Throw in the classic male tied to the bed & played with scenes along with the males running around naked scenes & what you have is a fraudulent teaser. Do not waste your money, don't even watch if your buddy has it & offers to let you borrow because you'll only be disappointed. Your girlfriend on the other hand may enjoy it...",1344211200,11,979,4.157894736842105
4131352,4,B003JQZY76,"Lol, there are quite a few bad reviews, but I gotta say it was a funny movie. Why was it disgusting? I saw like 10 pair of boobs and a few vaginas and I liked it. It wasn't disgusting, it was fun. it's a comedy which I actually liked. Are you saying the movie is more disgusting then other cheer leading camps in real life? Or is this comedy more disgusting than real life people who love to masturbate few times a day and have sex with strangers? Oh please... This is a great comedy and I have taste for good movies.",1344038400,6,517,4.078431372549019

2010UR95 minutes
When they're hired to work at a cheerleading camp for the summer, two lusty college friends prepare for the most spirited three months of their lives. But the squad won't be ready for serious competition without some remedial training in sex appeal.

4131355,3,B003JQZY76,"#1 Cheerleader Camp probably deserves all the negative reviews.  It's really bad.  However for some cheap trashy fun and lots of hot female nudity (and I mean LOTS- more than you'd witness in your typical comedy that's for sure) I'm willing to give the movie a free pass.

It's about two teenage guys who join the cheerleader camp for one purpose- to play checkers.  I'm kidding of course!  You know why two young men would want to go to a cheerleader camp because the reason practically speaks for itself doesn't it?  Yes, it does.  These two boys basically serve as a reminder just how sex-driven young men really are.

Anyway two things happen while at the camp.  The two friends make a bet over who will be the first to score with two chicks at once.  The other more important part of the story is that two competing cheerleader groups want to win a competition but we discover the one group doesn't have enough cheerleaders so it's the job of the two boys to go out and search for some.  Well guess what they do?  They pick up prostitutes much to the displeasure of the girls back at cheerleader camp.  This means when the cheerleader rehearsal is underway, the prostitutes act like prostitutes and not like cheerleaders.  This leads to a few funny scenes.

The humor is based entirely around teenage behavior involving sex, nudity, masturbation and such things.  You will definitely get your fill concerning the nudity of the women, that's for sure!  Some of the jokes don't work however, such as the VERY obvious one involving the guy who likes other guys quietly dressed in a beaver costume, and how he tricks the one guy into thinking he's a girl by walking him to the back room.  You knew he was a guy because he didn't say a word until he took his clothes off.  Other jokes such as sexually taking advantage of a watermelon and the ""butt cans"" (yeah, I'm not kidding) missed the mark with me.  WAY too silly.

This is not a memorable film by any means.  It's basically pointless nonsense to satisfy the sex addicts who are watching this stuff.  However I've seen worse.  At least it tried to be exciting.  Well until the second half when the entire cheerleader storyline fell completely flat and just dissolved into nothingness for up to 30 minutes.  The writing was obviously very weak overall because there wasn't enough substance to fill up a 90-minute film.  Overall, not bad but nothing particularly great either.",1335916800,4,2429,4.640845070422535
4131356,1,B003JQZY76,"Terrible movie, a few brief flash nudity which was more crude than anything.  Main actress Really dumb people.  Not enough hot cheerleaders.  It was a bad camp film with enough jerks to go around.  Most teen movies you like at least one person, I didn't like anyone in the entire film no one was the under dog and the love interest wasn't special.",1318723200,3,347,4.4603174603174605
4131357,5,B003JQZY76,"In the interest of painting myself as objective a reviewer as possible, and not just a raving fanatic, I will say that comedies by The Asylum don't usually do it for me, as they skimp a little too much on story for the sake of sex, drugs and flatulence. But #1 Cheerleader Camp is a pleasant exception, while still fulfilling, in kind, all the aforementioned detractors.

Basically Bring it On meets Meatballs with a dash of American Pie: Band Camp, the film concerns two young men who somehow land jobs working maintenance at a cheerleader camp. Naturally, they're in it for the perks. And there are lots of perks. Or at least perky things. Take for instance the opening scene, man's best friend: buxom young ladies on trampolines. For real. The film opens the same way The Man Show used to close. And just in case you're thinking, ""wow, that's incredibly sexist,"" uh-uh, nope, it was written by a woman, so, you know, not sexist.

Neither then is the group shower scene, the best - if ""best"" can be conscienably applied to describing a group shower scene - of its kind since Porky's, nor the sprinkler montage, a rival to Phoebe Cates' iconic pool emergence in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. ""How many more references is he going to make?"" you may be asking yourself? None.

As for performances, for me the film was made and saved by Seth Cassell, who I really didn't like in Sex Pot, but here found to be more subtle and restrained, thus actually funny. As for the other guy, he was passable, but I was really distracted by the fact that he looks a lot like the douche who plays Ted on How I Met Your Mother. Beyond the principles, there is a bevvy of naked chicks - as though cheerleaders weren't enough, strippers enter about halfway through - a cameo from Mega Piranha hero Paul Logan and Lucy from Dallas (Charlene Tilton) playing herself with unabashed bravado. That's really all you need to know.",1298937600,31,1904,4.577712609970675

8398433,2,B003JQZY76,"I've seen other Asylum films in this same formula and come away pleasantly surprised, but this one is disappointing and that's an understatement. Getting this out of way, you pretty much know what to expect from the production values--middling at best. Acting, mostly poor. Script, pretty awful. So nothing surprising about that.

The disappointment comes in two parts: One, the comedy, which is very unfunny and tries hard to gross the viewer out rather than make him or her laugh with anything clever; and two, the appalling lack of nudity and sexuality, which is supposed to be the whole point. It seems as though they blew the entire budget on getting as many hot girls in this as possible and didn't have enough left over actually to pay any of them to disrobe or do anything particularly sexy. Near the beginning there is a shower scene that sets the tone for the whole thing: about eight women enter a public shower area and strip down to underwear; seven of them are super hot. The one ugly one is the one who goes full monty for the gratuitous shower scene. Wonderful opportunity there lost because (again, speculating) the ugly chick likely came with the lowest price tag.

Don't get me wrong, there is SOME nudity, most of it provided by a couple or three strippers who later join the cheer camp. And they definitely are hot, but don't expect to see much in the way of the gratuitousness that normally makes movies like this one worth watching. The sequences in the strip club are shot in about 85 percent darkness with a lot of quick cuts, so you can't really see much. I don't understand that approach, but whatever. If you're not going to use what you have available, you're going to get a bad review like this one.

The director instead spends more time showing one of the male cast members simulating masturbation throughout the whole film, which I guess is supposed to be funny? In fact most of this movie's sexuality came from that character, not from any of the women.

In short--pass this one up.",1485993600,,2016,4.638655462184874
