8207993,5,B000T601VS,While I think it was worthy of 5 stars it was very thorough & interesting but it was a one time thing. Not something I want to watch again & again.  Actually all the boos I have read about him have been far more satisfying.,1440374400,,223,3.9555555555555557
8207994,2,B000T601VS,"There are better documentaries available about Steve McQueen. The narrator insists on inserting his own life into the movie (because he knew McQueen personally). There are several minutes of his life where I found myself saying, ""I don't care. Get back to McQueen."" You can find footage and information about McQueen elsewhere that focuses on just McQueen. Only get this if you are a devoted fan of McQueen (which is why I bought it).",1209340800,2,434,4.878378378378378
8207995,3,B000T601VS,"This is a pretty good documentary that isn't all that redundant if you have the great Steve McQueen doc on the 2 disc Bullit DVD. My biggest problem is an annoying voice over talent that is supposed to be Steve McQueen but sounds
more like a cross between later day Brian Wilson and Bill Murray as Carl the groundskeeper in Caddyshack...it would have been much better if it wasn't such an attempt at an imitation and a bad one at that. All the other famous folks who worked with Steve over the years are imitated as well....they are good imitations but a bit strange. Very good footage, lots I haven't seen before(but aspect ratios on The Getaway and Pappilon are screwed up), so I recommend ...just be prepared for the lame McQueen imitation. I should also warn you..to be prepared for a narrative breaking B story that keeps upsetting the flow...that of the story of the life of the director...as if we care?",1195430400,5,910,4.588957055214724
8207996,5,B000T601VS,"My family loved this documentary and my boys, 12 & 14 have a new Hollywood Favorite! McQueen apeals to them as they share the love of cars in a big way!",1183507200,,152,3.935483870967742
