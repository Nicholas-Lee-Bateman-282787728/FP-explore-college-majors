8760440,4,B01F7WDN90,"I like master Matsuda's teaching style.  His step by step approach and the way he breaks everything down makes it easy to follow, and his explanations include so much information that I cannot think of anything I would need any further clarification on.  The ONLY complaint I have about this particular volume is that while he does breakdown the entire Tall Monkey form there is no demonstration of the form as a whole, from start to finish, uninterrupted.  Other than that the video is excellent and that missing piece of demonstration is why I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 star rating.",1492646400,,586,4.615384615384615
8760441,1,B01F7WDN90,"This DVD is utterly useless. There is NOTHING on it regarding Monkey Kung Fu fighting. I was expecting to see the techniques & moves from the monkey forms demonstrated as to there fighting / self defense usage. I have watched the entire DVD from start to end and what you get is mostly talking about how monkey likes to grab & pull the opponents GI / clothes & pull them down to the ground where you can use your low monkey techniques - but what techniques? He shows some incredibly feeble knees & elbows & NOTHING more! And this goes on for the entire DVD! UTTER GARBAGE! Michael Matsuda, you should be ashamed of yourself for putting out this useless garbage. I feel SO cheated. I could have done a better job myself by trying to work out the moves in the forms for myself.",1489968000,2,775,4.3517241379310345
8760442,2,B01F7WDN90,"I first began learning martial arts in the late 70's and have been teaching for the last 15 years.  When one of my sons expressed an interest in Monkey Kung Fu as a part of his advanced studies, I had no idea of what the art entailed or where to find learning materials.  It was only when we found this series that I agreed to let him incorporate this into his acknowledged training.  With this in mind, I have undertaken the task of writing a review for the series.  In my opinion the first five videos in this series are excellent.  Master Michael Matsuda is a top level martial artist and a wonderful instructor.  These first five introductory videos are some of the best available in martial arts and it can easily be seen that the instructor is someone to be reckoned with.  Volume 6 continues with the same fine instruction, however my only criticism is that I felt the background was a bit distracting.  It was harder to see the small details in this particular environment.  In volume 7 the instructor incorporates one of his students in the video but continues to provide the same level of instruction.  He does include a segment on the acting out of this lost monkey personality in the form, but his student shows none of this aspect.  A large part of this style has always been the psychological uncertainty of facing an opponent that seems to be more animal than man.  When master Matsuda is demonstrating, this psychological aspect is apparent, when his student is demonstrating, it is not.  Volume 8 and 9 deal with the Silver Staff.  In volume 8 we again receive great instruction on basic staff techniques but in volume 9 we see a student taking on the main role.  It's not bad, but I would rather have seen the Master perform the technique and continue his meticulous instruction rather than what was offered to us.  Volume 10 features a senior student with a greatly reduced commentary for instruction.  This is the form that we are  told is the third form, along with the staff, that results in the Black belt being awarded for the system.  Yet the technical details are not explained in depth, as with the other videos.  The presenter is adequate but his mistakes were not cut and re-filmed, just left in the production and in certain places he fails to correct elements that the master tells us should be done differently.  There is also no mention of the psychology behind the form although to be fair this is the ""Stone Monkey"".  There is also random talking in the background of this video which is distracting.  Yet all of these criticisms are just minor technical points or matters of personal preference, minor details that could make the series even better.  However we finally come to the present volume in the series which is the ""Drunken Monkey"".  To me it seems obvious that the underlying psychology and fundamental actions should be ""drunken"" but here we see simply the movements of the form being carried out, like any other form.  There is no commentary, and the performance of the student is weak.  For example, Master Matsuda's kicks are always powerful as he performs in the series, even the kicks of the student in Volume 10 seemed strong, but the kicks demonstrated here show poor extension and lack power.  Did I mention there is no commentary?  There is no verbal instruction, what we have here is simply watching a student perform a form, in a junk yard setting, over and over again.  Some of us have waited for years for this next video to come out and I for one am extremely disappointed.  If you have any interest in Monkey Kung Fu get volumes 1-8 and if you want to continue from there volume 9 and 10 are worth having.  Volume 11 is not the worst martial arts video I have ever seen but it is more like something you would find home produced on e-bay. ""Hi, my name is Phil and here is a video of my kid doing stuff in my backyard dojo.""  In Summery, Master Matsuda is a fantastic martial artist and a great instructor.  Buy all the videos where he provides demonstration and instruction.  Consider buying the videos where he provides instruction while a student demonstrates.  Only buy this video as a last resort because you wanted to see what the ""drunken monkey"" form is kind of like and you can't find it anywhere on the internet.",1470268800,8,4283,4.582128777923785
