33033,3,0780629752,"Movie was OK, but no where near a 5 star movie.  Could have been much better and less cliche on Italian Americans and actors.",1431648000,,125,4.208333333333333
33034,4,0780629752,Enjoyed it.  Can't say it was 5 stars but it was a surprise and fun.,1429401600,,68,3.533333333333333
33035,5,0780629752,I have never ben able to find this film in DVD format so I finally ordered he last existing copy in VHS and plan to see if it can be transferred.  The company from which it was sent notified me immediately when it was returned to them becasuse I made an error in my address. I asked them to correct address and it arrived yesterday.  .,1381190400,,335,4.0606060606060606
33036,5,0780629752,"The other 5 star reviews say it very well, about this film.  Let me just
say that I agree with the other 5 star reviews.  Anybody who is interested in
actors or acting should probably see this film.  It's about acting and friendship,
and very well done.",1374883200,,253,4.340425531914893
33037,5,0780629752,"The story, the acting (from an amazing list of actors), and the collecting it all together is as good as it gets.  You can watch it over and over, because there is so much skill going into every scene that you will always find something new from someone else.

Now, if we could just get the releasing company to offer it on DVD.",1356912000,,328,4.190476190476191
33038,5,0780629752,"I don't understand why this enjoyable movie is not on DVD. Wittily shows the shallowness and competitiveness of the movie industry. David Strathairn is, as usual, excellent.",1309996800,,173,5.444444444444445
33039,5,0780629752,"How far will friends go to get that ""big break"" in Hollywood?  If you're a wanna-be Sopranos star, the news of Martin Scorcese casting for the leads in an Al Capone film is too good to be true.  This amusing film skillfully manuevers the lies and deception that four friends pull on each other as each jockey's for that coveted interview... incredible casting, including quite a few surprise ""star"" bits, keeps the film fresh, lively and on target.",1145923200,4,448,4.730769230769231
33040,5,0780629752,"I picked up this film randomly from the sale table at Hollywood Video, primarily because of its incredible cast. It has become one of my favorite films of all time. If you enjoy the angst of an Albert Brooks comedy, you will love the smorgasboard of professional actor angst served up by this gem. The plot revoles around four friends (Adam Arkin, David Straithairn, John Tenny, and Robert Costanzo) all of whom have achieved a modicum of success in Hollywood as B-List players, but all of whom aspire to become A-List."" When one gets the casting call of a lifetime for a Scorcese film, the other three, green with envy, start jockeying surreptitiously for a reading. Their supportive but realistic wives and girlfriends(Amy Madigan, Elle McPherson, Laura San Giacomo and Lauren Tan) suffer through the madness of their Method, and the self absorbtion/self doubt of these guys reaches sizemic proportions. The climax provides a major surprise and the epilogue proves that once bitten, the acting bug burrows in for life. Great supporting roles, by Bill Murray, Beverly D'Angelo, Michael McKean, Martin Scorcese and Gary Marshall, make this wry comedy a must see and a must have.",1133136000,10,1178,5.01530612244898
33051,4,0780629752,"Entertaining & definitely worth viewing.  But I feel conflicted about this flick:  FANTASTIC cast, enhanced by very engaging relationships among the characters.  But there are weaknesses and inconsistencies in the storyline and script, which can't decide what it wants to be:  is this a ""morality play"" about the responsibilities, intricacies and betrayals of ""walking the tightrope"" of friendship; or is this about the frustrations, intricacies, heartbreak and betrayals of ""Hollywood Life""?  The storyline bounces around, trying to be too many things instead of being focused.  There are also stops-and-starts inconsistencies in how the scenes flow; i.e., one of the best scenes, with the biggest hook (the confrontation in Venice Beach with the ""gumbas"" from Buffalo NY) doesn't unfold until 1 hour into the film!  Then it stalls and fizzles.  I came away feeling frustrated because of the storyline's unfilled potential; BUT blown away by the GREAT cast and fantastic acting -- which shows the true talent of all these stellar actors who can take a flawed storyline, and, in spite of the flaws, manage to squeeze out the very best that the script has to offer!  Now, that's talent!  Proof positive is the closing scene where the competing actors / friends all audition before Martin Scorcese.  Epic!  Standing ovation!  I recommend watching this film just to be awed by the ""acting chops"" on full panoramic display in the Scorcese final audition scene.  Overall, the film's cast saves the day!  (Even Garry Marshall makes a cameo appearance in the last scene!)",1483228800,,1564,5.2
33052,2,0780629752,Didn't like the storyline,1482278400,,25,5.5
33053,5,0780629752,"A fun, accurate movie that does not star Bill Murray, but a nice cast effort with a lot of movie names. It was funny, sad, and interesting about the whole auditioning business in a town primarily filled with actors all trying for the same thing while their families watch/support, putting themselves second. A nice ensemble of good actors. The standout was David S. as Armand, though it was exactly what one would expect from him.",1477094400,,430,4.746666666666667
33054,4,0780629752,"I like when comedy can be crafted not from telling jokes but from peeking into the lives of everyday friends...That's what we have here...a fine ensemble cast and good performances by all, particularly Adam Arkin, who seems to be involved with the funniest sequences...An enjoyable hour and a half, this film never found the wider audience it deserves",1476576000,,351,5.068965517241379

33075,5,0780629752,"So funny and filled with heart and the wrenching truth of trying to get a leg up in the challenging acting scene. The brilliant cast is hilarious and on-point, with great cameos by Bill Murray and Martin Scorsese. Writing and directing by Philip F. Messina not ony delivers great comic timing and skill but an insider's truth about the price tags on our passions.",1451692800,,363,4.6875
33076,3,0780629752,"With names like Straithairn, Tenney, Madigan, Arkin, San Giacomo, I would have thought performances would be a little bit larger. Allow the characters to develop a deeper sense of self, going for an interview and hopefully, a new job. It isn't career shattering, but it may......and I will leave it at that. I am not an actor, but I can imagine the hard work and effort it takes to eke out a living in Hollyblood.  this isn't a blockbuster, and it never will be, but I expected a touch of reality. Perhaps it's best I didn't get what I expected. A few genuine moments of laughter, when the seemingly endless frustration leads to a chance.  The thing is, this film sort of struggles much as the cast members portray, so why on earth would they want to work so hard for no visible gain?  DeAngelo didn't do her lovely hair any justice by the stupid looking hot red wig, that's for certain.  That bit sort of aged her.  Poor makeup choice.
There were some great puns and some moments of regret. The best performance was given by Garry Marshall, in his walk on role.  I still haven't figured out why Elle McPherson was in this film, she may be a great model, but an actor? Oh please. Junior High School play, maybe.
All in all, I enjoyed the film because i had lowered my expectations going in. That's the 3 star retreat. Not sure I loved it, but I couldn't slam it with only one *.  Still, you have to be a fan of B films to watch this again.  So a one-time look is all I get.",1450396800,,1473,4.273381294964029
33077,3,0780629752,"It's a movie with (I believe) a imited audience; namely that of small time actors trying to make it in the big time. There were a few funny lines, and the overall portrayal of actors as ""products"" was accurate enough, but the story could have been told in a fraction of the time - it seemed very redundant and ""run-on"" to me.",1449014400,,325,4.258064516129032

33104,5,0780629752,"""With Friends Like These"" is a comic masterpiece! This story of desperate ambition and betrayal, set in Hollywood, revolves around a group of close friends, B-movie and TV actors, with a shot at the big time who prepare to and audition for the starring role in a Martin Scorcese film.
The humor is sharp, intelligent, insightful, adult and consistent throughout a superbly crafted script..  Messina's camera is as sympathetic and effective as the characters he created..
If there was an Academy Award  category for Best Cameo, Bill Murray would have walked away with the Oscar.
The cast is first rate.
The closing scene song by Garland Jeffreys is a gem.
