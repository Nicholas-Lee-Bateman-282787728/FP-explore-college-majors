7936209,1,B00005B1VS,I would like to review the movie but there is no movie here! All that exists here is a bad soft porn horny porny. Needless to say I enjoyed it thoroughly; however 1 star for nothing new whatsoever.,1402099200,,197,4.2105263157894735
7936210,1,B00005B1VS,"This movie has nothing. Well  there are a few good songs but as a movie this stinks AND whoever was in charge of the closing credits didn't even get that right because they didn't give credit for any of the music. The first 11 minutes play out like several bad music videos. The camera work in the beginning makes me believe this was first shot by a teen learning to use  a home camera. There are more than a half dozen cliched lines in the movie. The acting needs to improve a bit to fit into the amateur category. I'm surprised everyone didn't use aliases. The plot is silly and predictable. Ok there are some hotties in the nude but even those scenes were looped to stretch scenes that were already too long. Have I mentioned that I didn't like the movie? It's thinly veiled soft porn that is poorly acted,filmed and directed . If you want skin, I'd recommended just renting some porn. If you want a good movie, with acting and a plot, rent or buy something else....almost anything else in fact.",1180828800,,998,4.418478260869565
7936211,5,B00005B1VS,"This movie has EVERYTHING you could ever ask for out of a ""B"" movie:  a shallow plot,  bad acting, a lame script, a propensity to take itself too seriously, bad acting, a director who seems to have fallen asleep and left a few gaps in the movie, bad acting and lots and LOTS of gratuitous nudity.

Amber Smith is stunning as a late-night DJ who is harrassed by a man who calls in.  Ostensibly, he is the guy who murdered her sister.  Even worse, he knows where she lives.  Oh, no!  OK, OK, it's not exactly Alfred Hitchcock, but that's the plot.

As you've probably guessed by now, the saving grace of this film is the amount of skin in it, and there is a lot.  Most all of the girls in the movie strip-down, and all of the girls in the flick are pretty hot.

If you're looking for a movie with a good plot & a top-notch ensemble of actors, then it's best to skip over this one.  If you like ""B"" movies and / or erotic thrillers, then this one is worth a look.  Amber Smith may not be a great actress, but she compensates for that via her beauty (not to mention taking her shirt off!).",1145145600,18,1085,4.114285714285714
7936212,1,B00005B1VS,"A truly dreadful video, a sorry excuse to show bare chested, dare I call them ladies?  The worst actor had to be the male cop.
And just where was Colin Mochrie?  He is listed in the cast on this page, but was NOT in the movie, and NOT listed in the credits at the end of the movie, and Colin Mochrie was the sole reason I bought this video.  Boooooo, 1 star is too much.",1017100800,3,370,3.9066666666666667
7936213,2,B00005B1VS,Amber Smith is beautiful but the movie is amateur hour at its finest. Poor acting and script. Wait for cable and only watch it if there is absolutely nothing else on.,1001462400,5,166,4.387096774193548
