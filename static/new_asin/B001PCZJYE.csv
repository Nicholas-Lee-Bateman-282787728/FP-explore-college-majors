8333155,5,B001PCZJYE,"His was a great life and is well depicted in this dvd.  I think you come away with the feeling that he would have done great things, and that we suffered a great loss.  This is a wonderful tribute.",1389052800,3,197,4.0256410256410255
8333156,5,B001PCZJYE,"I still think about Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and think about his sacrifice for this United States. I was the last person to speak with him at the Ambassador Hotel. Our group, THE SOUNDS OF TIME, traveled with him in Southern California. This is a wonderful opportunity for young America to learn about a selfless Patriot who died for us all. Love You Bobby.",1330905600,18,355,4.5625

8333158,5,B001PCZJYE,"I already own a different DVD on RFK (his biography), so I thought since this was 200 minutes long with three different sections, it would be a good supplement to it. The first part of this dvd however, is the same thing that I already had. It is a biography on RFK from the A&E channel titled, ""RFK-His Many Sides"". The last two parts are from the History Channel, the assassination conspiracy theory and the RFK and LBJ relationship. These I had never seen before, so I thought it was highly entertaining. Just a warning to those who already own the DVD from A&E, the first part of this dvd is a duplicate of that.",1262563200,27,616,4.3652173913043475
