4120834,5,B003G0E33G,"This DVD provides an excellent overview of the beginnings of Celtic culture, and continues on to provide more in the way the Celts lived and grew into various nationalities.

While I was looking for a more in-depth historical production, I could find no fault with this production, especially as it sparked the interest of my 10- and 15-yr-old.  They watched and learned, and wanted more, which is really what it's all about, right?  Giving them something that inspires them to learn more.",1301270400,40,489,4.939024390243903

4120845,3,B003G0E33G,"First off, the music. I won't say it is horrid, but it does seem that it plays a much larger role as one of the stars of the series than it ought to. And it's annoying. Okay, now for the facts:

1) Mostly this is accurate. And it's accurate in weird places. For instance: in the first episode, they start out by declaring the birthplace of the Celtic civilization was in the Hallstadt/La Tene valleys north of the Alps. This is the traditional viewpoint that scholars have held for years. Fine.

But then they introduce Dr. Bryan Sykes, who is THE authority on where the Celts came from. He is famous for leading the grassroots DNA testing that has accumulated a vast database of peoples' genes across the British Isles, Europe and North America. His and other geneticists' research has in the past 15 years basically thrown the traditional scholarly concept of the homeland of the Celts being located north of the Alps out of the window. Instead, the DNA clearly shows that the Celts came from the Iberian Peninsula. Although their language may have originated elsewhere, the people who are the Celts migrated up along the Atlantic Coast of Europe to settle the British Isles. Not from Central Europe.

So, the program introduces Dr. Sykes, after stating authoritatively that the Celtic homeland is in Central Europe, and then he starts explaining how that isn't so. But the narration never addresses this in any way whatsoever. It doesn't even say that there are two opposing ideas. It just says: this is how it is, but then introduces an expert who says: no, that is wrong. And then they don't explain.

2) They then keep making these conjectures about why the archaeological evidence from Central Europe don't quite match up with British Celtic finds. And then they say how the Spanish Celts are an anomalous group who must have migrated into the Iberian Peninsula.

But, once again, they bring out Dr. Sykes, and he explains that the Celts originated in the Iberian Peninsula. But once again, the program doesn't tie this together in any way. It's like sitting between two people arguing their point without listening to each other, and without providing an explanation about why they disagree.

So, in the end, the program is nice to watch. They show a beautiful ancient Celtic horn excavated at the hillfort of Alesia where Vercingetorix was defeated by Julius Caesar. And they have lots of pretty scenery, lots of fascinating stuff to see. So that's nice. But for someone who is not well-read about the factual details, there would be no way to make out what exactly is factual and what has been discounted by recent scientific discoveries.

But at least they have the music to fall back on. That ubiquitous, overpowering, odd music. The lyrics are probably in some Celtic language, but for the life of me, I swear it sounds like they kept singing: ""La Puta Ma"". Which, in Spanish, is not a nice thing to say...",1405468800,28,2919,4.756916996047431
4120846,5,B003G0E33G,"This six part series is an excellent overview of the history of the various people who historically have been grouped together under the heading of Celts.  While focusing mostly on the British Isles and the Celtic links to Wales, Scotland and Ireland, it nonetheless is a comprehensive look at linguistic, cultural and social aspects spanning from before the Roman conquest to the Norman period of the 11th century.  Highly recommended for historical enthusiasts as well as those new to this subject.",1394841600,22,500,5.160493827160494
4120847,3,B003G0E33G,"This video provides an important new perspective, i.e., that there appears to be no genetic link between the Celts of the UK and those of the continent.  This has led to the theory that there was no Celtic ""invasion"" of Britain, but, instead, that language and customs evolved as a result of trade and other interaction with the continent.  Otherwise, I would rate the 2004 video superior.  Better still are the videos on individual countries such as The Story of Ireland, The Story of Wales, and A History of Scotland.",1393200000,4,519,4.7444444444444445
4120848,4,B003G0E33G,"The first hours of this program are the best because they present the story through archaeological evidence. The middle hours lose steam and rely more on reenactments than relics or documents. The last hour is about modern Celts and doesn't have much to say.

I still enjoyed watching this series, the photography is exemplary. The narrative is clear and enlightening, even for me, who seeks out all things Celtic. I highly recommend it.",1390867200,11,437,4.986301369863014

4120850,5,B003G0E33G,"This dvd series is erudite and substantive. It lends itself to a clear, historical perspective and makes a point of not abandoning from what is generally accepted in the historical community of the Celtic peoples in place for what may be vogue in the subsequent mythos sprung from latter years. It does, in one episode, make a point of denigrating the neo-pagan movement for linking popularly-believed Celtic centers of the British isles such as Stonehenge. But other than that perhaps condescension, the series did a fantastic job at delivery in imagery, prose, and perhaps to my liking most of all, the score.",1383868800,,611,5.0

4120852,5,B003G0E33G,Very well done public television series with beautiful music. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in our Celtic history. It's not every day that you see something created for Welsh Public Broadcasting!,1357776000,,203,5.375
4120853,5,B003G0E33G,"This show ,which looks outstanding on dvd! ALot of kulturs videos I have only seen on vhs, and they were of that quality.  Now I wish that I had seen them on dvd instead. Of course vhs lasted until 2005 somehow! Anyways this is a very informative and interesting six part miniseries about the celts. It was produced in wales which still speaks a celtic language! (as well as english thankfully). The shows cover the start of the celtic awareness and civilization , which stretched from the British Ilands , accross Europe and down into Turkey. It also shows that the culture was spread not through conquest but by influence. So the celts of the uk were influenced by the celts of the continent and adapted to their culture without a invasion at all.  One episode covers the bloody celtic religions that were part of the culture, human sacrifice and the worship of heads were a big part of it. But many areas had human sacrifice back then, including the romans who did it in the games and not for religious purposes.  another covers , the later years as the anglo saxons come into the uk. What is ironic is the way people like todays druids claim stonhenge for themselves when the people who made it and used it were not celtic at all! Nor do todays orgiastic ceremonies accurately reflect the true celtic relgions. But they do look fun those Mayday celebrations; even if the british ones are just for fun.  I didn't know that by the true end of the celtic civilization, the roman invasion period, that the celts in central Europe had real cities with law courts and everything. These people were not barbarians at all. And even long before the celts europeons were able to farm very affectively as well. With crop yeilds equal to the 20th centuries!  Yes, this is a educational show but it's not slanted and it's not the fastest moving show. Instead it's a celebration of the celtic heritage which had some influence on roman culture and of course ours today.  This is a classy show for those with a good attention span though.",1319932800,30,2027,4.585635359116022

8396267,3,B003G0E33G,"Another disjointed view of English History.  The Celts were a Germanic tribe like the Anglo Saxons, the term Germanic Tribes came from Rome to identify the so called barbarians. Whom, were just as civil as the barbaric Romans.  The Celts moved into Ireland, The Anglo Saxons invaded and settled middle England, the Romans dominated southern England and the Vikings controlled northern England.  There are no Englishmen because they are a composite of all three invasions, that is why so many German Royals married into the blood line of England.",1462492800,,545,5.101123595505618

8396273,2,B003G0E33G,"This production is seriously out of date. Recent developments in genetics, particularly in our ability to obtain ancient genomic data, have rendered obsolete the old idea, repeated in this series, that the Celts of the British Isles were merely the descendants of Mesolithic hunter-gatherers who arrived in the Isles soon after the last Ice Age. Now it appears likely that the first speakers of an Italo-Celtic language to arrive in Britain and Ireland were Copper Age and Bronze Age Beaker Folk, like the famous Amesbury Archer.

On the aesthetic level, the cinematography of this series is nice, but most of the music is just awful. I do not recommend this production. It is a waste of money and time.",1433635200,3,703,4.907563025210084
