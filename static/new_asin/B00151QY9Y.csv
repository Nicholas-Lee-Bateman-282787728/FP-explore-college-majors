The Killing Gene is one of the most recent and it is one dark film. Horton's above, in-house review is right on the money. I don't think I've seen a film as ugly and mean as this since Last Exit to Brooklyn.

In a nutshell, a rape victim exacts revenge on her attackers in such a way as to expose what humans are down to their very genes. Much of the movie is shot at night and the location scouts managed to find the ugliest, nastiest parts of the city in which to film. And dark as the scenes are, the colors are over-saturated and give the viewer the impression that everything is covered in slime and mold. The characters, with the exception of Melissa George, are also a mean and dismal lot. One wonders why the Stellan Skarsgard character hasn't committed suicide long ago. Both the good and bad guys are miserable examples of humanity.

As in other movies of this type, the killer leaves behind clues. These clues are grad school level. (Aren't there any stupid serial killers in the world?)

3137200,4,B00151QY9Y,"One of the most harrowing and psychologically disturbing torture-themed horror movies out there, The Killing Gene (aka W-Delta-Z) is one that was good upon watching it, but that I actually came to appreciate more in the days following it, as events and ideas played around in my mind and I looked at it in different ways.  On the surface an overwhelmingly nihilistic movie, you realize after a while that there are subtle aspects and rays of imperfect light peaking through all the vicious darkness that add an unexpected texture.

  A jaded police veteran (Stellan Skarsgard of 'The Exorcist: The Beginning') and a young rookie (Melissa George of '30 Days Of Night' and 'Turistas') are the main investigators who uncover a ghastly trail of serial double-murders where in each case, one victim appears to have been tortured into killing the other, usually someone close to them.  The case leads down a dark and bloody trail of clues and possible motivations, and surprisingly, the mastermind behind the double-murders turns out to be far from the most vicious character in the series of events.  The Killing Gene starts painting a very cynical, very unflattering portrait of humanity, full of loathesome low-lifes and utterly battered-down, mentally defeated would-be good guys, and it's not easy to shrug it off because it's done so damn well.  But there are glimmers of other things in there amidst all the raw evil too: shades of characters who've done terribly the wrong thing but thought at the time it was for the right reason; a burgeoning compassion that emerges only in a desperate scene of viciousness; and the strange attempt at a path to redemption taken by a character who was bent into something dark by events absolutely beyond their control.  The Killing Gene could have ended up being one of the more depressing movies ever made, but miraculously avoids it and settles on grim and tragic.  I don't know about others, but I don't mind tragic or sad movies, but outright depressing I can do without.

  The acting is magnificent, especially given the demands of the roles.  Skarsgard in particular turns in an award-worthy performance.  The movie isn't for everyone, because the brutality level is beyond extreme, but it works for the film.  A few of the recent torture-horror movies have been so busy trying to out-brutal every other movie in existance that they've forgotten about everything else, including not just being an extreme movie but being a Good extreme movie.  Killing Gene is among the best of its crop though, scary and extremely well done.",1240099200,,2571,4.97196261682243
3137201,4,B00151QY9Y,"The premise of Sartre's ""No Exit"" is that hell is other people. The flip side plays in ""The Killing Gene"" directed by Tom Shankland. Hell is choosing to kill someone you love in place of yourself.

The premise begins in a research laboratory with animals. Put one wild card animal in a cage with a group of like kind: snake in with monkeys. Would one monkey sacrifice his life for the others? The research says no. The researcher said the monkeys become just genes. Then two lab assistants decide a twist of provocation on people, beginning with the third lab assistant (Selma Blair) and her mother. They savagely rape and torture her until she kills her mother to stop the hideous assault. The brief snippets of these brutal, bloody hours are not for the squeamish.

Then the serial killings begin through twists and turns of who does what to whom. It becomes a grisly story of extreme betrayal of love and trust. Or are we turned into ""genes"" in the savage grip of shrieking pain, and it becomes every person for him or herself.

The two newly paired detectives, veteran cop Eddie Argo, played by Stellan Skarsgard (who performs a 180 from his recent role in ""Mamma Mia"") and Melissa George, a terrified rookie in desperate circumstances but who has the guts to do her job and do it well.  This is a detective squad taken right from the set of ""Shield""--gritty, profane, probably dirty, and weary and numb from the rawness and violence of their daily lives. As Eddie tells his partner, ""There are always shades of gray.""

The story is truly film-noir with dark, ugly streets, littered, grafittied halls and walls, dirty, stinking settings in most scenes. So add this bizarre form of serial killing for this squad to solve. Nothing is as it seems.

Sometimes too much of a good thing is not so good. The music--very heavy and atmospheric often over powers the dialog, leaving the viewer to figure out the whispery mumblings of some of the words. However, most films that exude dark and ominous settings overdo it: this one does Dark perfectly.

The conclusion, like most of the story, is an unexpected twist and is past ""edgy."" Surprisingly, this is one scene played with restraint.

If you don't already know the extremes human beings will take for pain avoidance, then ""The Killing Gene"" will be a provocative film. But even amongst all the bleakness, there will always exist that one human who will not act according to genes.",1231286400,6,2430,4.714622641509434
3137202,4,B00151QY9Y,"I gave the film 4 stars because of the original and somewhat novel script, although as a previous reviewer said, it was certainly reminiscent of Saw and Hostel. If you didn't like those films, this probably won't be for you. I watched the unrated version which may have had more on screen gore, violence, torture than the rated version. Both versions are on the disc.

I won't spend much time revisiting the plot of the film, since it has ably been done by a previous reviewer. The premise is a serial killer wants to prove a mathematical equation, and is using human guinea pigs to prove or disprove the theory.

The theory, is that the individual does not act out of loyalty or love, when given a choice, and will choose to kill a loved one, before dying. The detectives are in a race against time to stop the killer before the equation is completed in human trials, hence the original UK title WAZ, or the killing gene.

The director wanted to preserve a European feel to the film, as opposed to a big budget glossy Hollywood production. He succeeded, making a darker, grittier, seedier flick than a Hollywood production, although I found the dialogue a bit hard to decipher at the beginning of the film, especially with Stellan Skarsgard's accent.

Skarsgard is an accomplished actor, captured the persona of a gruff brooding NYPD detective well, so it may have been the attempt to capture background noises of a big city, during exterior shots, that contributed to the effect.

I thought a number of the British actors pulled off a great job as American street tough gangsters, and was surprised to see Selma Blair of Hellboy II with an integral role in the film.

I must caution I gave this film high marks because I had never heard of the film, had diminished expectations, and was pleasantly surprised at the results. If you don't mind a bit of gratuitous violence it works as a psychological thriller, and has a few somewhat predictable plot twists.

They did a great job of fleshing out the script, and made a seamless transition cutting from NYC exterior shots around Harlem's Morningside Heights, capturing the city's skyline and interior shots in Belfast, Ireland

I'm not sure if it was intentional, but some of the NYC street scenes paid homage to Death Wish, with a new twist. I look forward to seeing other films by director Tom Shankland.",1228521600,2,2356,4.701456310679611
3137203,3,B00151QY9Y,"It's been a while since I've seen a really good serial killer movie on par with SE7EN or Silence of the Lambs.  It's a tricky genre to get right, and Killer Gene manages to get it about three-quarters right with interesting characters and an intriguing motivation for the action.  But something about the plotting and the artificiality of ""science"" introduced into the story prevents ""Gene"" from joining the upper ranks.  A diverting enough film, certainly more intelligent and engaging than, say, Untraceable, but in the words of Maxwell Smart, it missed it by ""that much.""",1221436800,,574,5.021052631578947
3137204,3,B00151QY9Y,"""The Killing Gene"" stars Melissa George as rookie detective Helen O'Mara who is paired with veteran Eddie Argo [Stellan Skarsgard] who is reputed to be a by-the-book cop. They find themselves on the trail of a mysterious killer who seems to target members of a local gang notorious for their acts of violence, each of whom is murdered and carved with ""W Delta Z"". As they dig deeper, they find that the killings are all related and Helen's in-depth investigation reveals a troubling aspect to the case that is linked to an old case, one which Det Argo would rather not revisit.

This is quite a compelling thriller that makes the viewer think and try to sort out the clues that reveal the motives behind the gruesome murders. There are scenes of torture here that are reminiscent of movies like Saw and Hostel, and disturbingly one involving a kid. The basic premise here has to do with retribution, and this theme is truly convincingly portrayed. The two leads as portrayed by Skarsgard and George are credible in their roles, especially Skarsgard, and finally, there is Selma Blair in one of the most intense roles of her career thus far. Without revealing too much of the plot, I would recommend this movie for those who like compelling thrillers with twists.",1219190400,16,1262,4.762557077625571
3137205,2,B00151QY9Y,"What previews and clips I'd seen of The Killing Gene (also known as W Delta Z) made the film look like a bit more brutal variation of Seven, which seemed interesting enough.  Sadly, this is far from being anywhere close to that classic thriller, or practically anything else in the genre either for that matter.  The Killing Gene stars Stellan Skarsgard (Good Will Hunting, Deep Blue Sea, the original Insomnia) and Melissa George (30 Days of Night, Turistas, Amityville Horror) as cops investigating a bizarre murder in which a victim had an unusual mathematical formula carved into her body.  Soon enough, more bodies begin piling up, leading to some revelations and more bloody mayhem.  Nearly every bit of momentum that The Killing Gene manages to build up gets squandered, as what could have been an intense, psychological drama instead gets relegated into a torture flick that borrows heavily from all the Saw's and Hostel's to come before it.  That being said, most of The Killing Gene is an exercise in sadism that could have been something more, but instead is a sadly disappointing bore with an ending that will definitely make you squirm (and what happens here is something that has definitely been seen a little too much in these types of flicks as of late).  Skarsgard and George are good in the leads, as are Selma Blair, Ashley Walters, and Tom Hardy in smaller roles.  All in all, if the torture brand of the horror genre is your thing, you'll more than likely dig The Killing Gene, but for those of us who thought that this would be a good psychological thriller with some edge, you're better off looking elsewhere.",1219017600,3,1632,4.786476868327402

3137265,2,B00151QY9Y,"I'm not a horrorporn fan, so watching Slema Blair slice up a bunch of people for no real reason other than someone bad did something to her once (and is inexplicably the only person she lets go) was no fun to me. And I don't know if there is such a thing as a 'make everything green and look like an abandoned bathroom at a rest stop in Ecuador' filter that they have for cameras now, but the entire movie looks like it. You know how all the walls looked in 'Saw'? Every surface, place, person, and thing looks like that in this movie.

The dialogue is sparse but still awful. People's emotions rarely match what you think they should feel. There's almost no music of any kind through the whole movie. Nothing anyone does make any sense.

At one point, the two main cops go to a gang members house, talk to him for awhile. find out he killled his grandmother after being released by the killer, got a few fingers chopped off, then they leave. As they leave, they see rival gang members who are clearly going to go up to the apartment they just vacated and kill the guy living there, and then they just....leave.
Confused? Good. Me too. The whole movie is like this.

There are a few things that are not as awful. It is an intricate plot, and some parts of it weave well together when the characters talk coherently. Stellan Skarsgaard is good at looking very pissed off all the time. Selma Blair pulls off creepy murder genius with a good deal of pinache, even though she looks dead on the inside. Also, Tom Hardy is in it.

Overall, if you like really gross torture scenes and special features about goreporn torture scenes, then this movie might fair better under your eye. But I already donated my copy to goodwill and never plan to think about this movie again.",1357948800,,1765,4.404907975460123

3137267,4,B00151QY9Y,"I am not a huge fan of horror movies, and there were disturbing elements that I will never forget, but it has a twist at the end that is unexpected.",1332115200,,148,3.966666666666667
3137268,4,B00151QY9Y,"I saw this film for the second time about two years ago. The first viewing blew my mind. While there is some heavy-handedness in the film, in general this borders on a great thriller. It is one of the best such films I've seen. It has great suspense which builds and builds until the murderer, who becomes known, reveals the motive for a horrific payback for the gang's crimes.

The premise of the story is intriguing. Members of a violent (and markedly amoral) gang are being murdered, and the murderer has etched WdeltaZ into the bodies. The ""formula"" refers to a theory of imprinted human behavior which causes man to exhibit ""abnormal"" behaviors in intraspecies; these behaviors are humiliation, violence and killing. (See Konrad Lorenz' On Aggression, a layman's book based on his scientific, Nobel-prize winning work. I think this has got to be one of the sources the screenwriter used from his Psychology 101 course!) In the beginning of the film, in an animal experimentation lab, we are given this premise of innate aggression among primates.

Two detectives are assigned to the gang deaths, one a seasoned veteran and the other a rookie. The lead detective is haunted by a case of rape and murder which he failed to solve. This failure prompts his intense desire to solve the current crimes. Though Skarsgaard and George are competent in their detective roles, I found the other characters, especially Pierre ( the always remarkable Tom Hardy), more compelling. Selma Blair's is the single truly outstanding performance.

  SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!

In 1961, a study on human behavior known as ""The Milgram Experiment"" was conducted.  It created a firestorm of controversy. The screenwriter was no doubt familiar with this widely publicized experiment, too. The experiment involved two randomly selected people who were told they would be paid for playing roles of teacher and student. The teacher would ask questions, and if the student answered the question incorrectly, the teacher would apply electrical shocks from 15 volts to 450 volts. The administrator and the learner were conductors of the experiment -- only the ""teacher"" had no knowledge of the real purpose of the study.  The ""teacher"" could not see the ""learner,"" only the electric shock generator. The objective of the experiment was to determine the extent of pain one person would inflict upon another. The researchers wanted to know how long someone would continue to give shocks to another person if they were told to do so even if the shock would seriously hurt him [Stanley Milgram]. As the voltage increased from 15 to 450 volts, 65 percent of the ""teachers"" applied full voltage three times. (The researchers had expected between 1 to 2 per cent of the ""teachers"" to inflict the highest pain.) The ""learner"" played an audio tape of increasingly painful outbursts until the last three charges when the response was silence. Whenever the ""teacher"" wanted to stop, the administrator said he could not stop,,with increasing pressure of mild statement to stern command, he was ordered to continue to increase the shocks until the study ended. That 65 per cent of the ""teachers"" obeyed the administrator was an outcome totally unexpected by the administrators.

Now why am I going into all this psychological stuff? Because it has everything to do with the storyline especially in the resolution of the conflict.  What causes the behavior of the gang members to  inflict extreme violence upon others? Is it in our nature -- or in our nurture? What causes the behavior of the victim who delivers the payback for their crimes? Revenge in a hideously cruel punishment -- or in the imitation of the violence inflicted upon the victims? The film provokes some heavy thought, that's for sure.

I wrote this review not so much to comment on the story, which I think has been pretty much covered by others here, but to write about the underpinnings of the screenplay. I don't know if the screenwriter is familiar with the behavioral theories above, but I think he must be. I saw clear similarities between the facts and fiction of aggression in human behavior.  The conclusion of the film is brutally graphic. I remember thinking, omg, how can one person do that to another?! Isn't the payback a bit of overkill? But, looking at the provocation for the revenge, the same question came to mind. At some points, I felt my stomach tighten. It is not just the physical ""Q&A"" in the final scenes that appalls us but the terrible consequences meted out for ""wrong answers."" Rather than endure more physical pain, Pierre, for example, gives up the one person who loves him and whom he loves: his grandmother. What is the film saying when it leaves us feeling that certain punishments, no matter how cruel, are perfectly justified? Brrrrrr. Goosebumps!
I really like this movie. I have it in my collection, and after writing this ""review,"" I think I'll watch it again tomorrow!
PS: I ought to state that the Milgram Experiment's original purpose was to examine the motivation for war crimes committed by the Nazis during WWII, specifically, the explanation that the torturers were ""only following orders.""",1323302400,,5159,4.977932636469222
3137269,3,B00151QY9Y,"The movie does make you think a little. There were some twists that I didn't see coming. The script could have been better though. There were just so many holes. For example, early in the movie, so I am not giving anything away, a thug gets released from the killer. The killer doesn't hide from the victims, so this thug knows who the killer is. Instead of going to get revenge with his gang, he just hangs himself. That didn't make sense to me.

However, her stooping to take this role is not worth the rent payment. I guessed what lurked beneath Stellan Skarsgard's character after 30 minutes, and Ashley Walter's detective is -- as with so many female detective characters -- relegated to playing catch-up and proving her worth.

They savagely rape and torture her until she kills her mother to stop the hideous assault. The brief snippets of these brutal, bloody hours are not for the squeamish.

Then the serial killings begin through twists and turns of who does what to whom. It becomes a grisly story of extreme betrayal of love and trust. Or are we turned into ""genes"" in the savage grip of shrieking pain, and it becomes every person for him or herself.

The two newly paired detectives, veteran cop Eddie Argo, played by Stellan Skarsgard (who performs a 180 from his recent role in ""Mamma Mia"") and Melissa George, a terrified rookie in desperate circumstances but who has the guts to do her job and do it well.  This is a detective squad taken right from the set of ""Shield""--gritty, profane, probably dirty, and weary and numb from the rawness and violence of their daily lives. As Eddie tells his partner, ""There are always shades of gray.""

The story is truly film-noir with dark, ugly streets, littered, grafittied halls and walls, dirty, stinking settings in most scenes. So add this bizarre form of serial killing for this squad to solve. Nothing is as it seems.

Sometimes too much of a good thing is not so good. The music--very heavy and atmospheric often over powers the dialog, leaving the viewer to figure out the whispery mumblings of some of the words. However, most films that exude dark and ominous settings overdo it: this one does Dark perfectly.

The conclusion, like most of the story, is an unexpected twist and is past ""edgy."" Surprisingly, this is one scene played with restraint.

If you don't already know the extremes human beings will take for pain avoidance, then ""The Killing Gene"" will be a provocative film. But even amongst all the bleakness, there will always exist that one human who will not act according to genes.",1231286400,6,2430,4.714622641509434
3371699,4,B00151QY9Y,"I gave the film 4 stars because of the original and somewhat novel script, although as a previous reviewer said, it was certainly reminiscent of Saw and Hostel. If you didn't like those films, this probably won't be for you. I watched the unrated version which may have had more on screen gore, violence, torture than the rated version. Both versions are on the disc.

I won't spend much time revisiting the plot of the film, since it has ably been done by a previous reviewer. The premise is a serial killer wants to prove a mathematical equation, and is using human guinea pigs to prove or disprove the theory.

The theory, is that the individual does not act out of loyalty or love, when given a choice, and will choose to kill a loved one, before dying. The detectives are in a race against time to stop the killer before the equation is completed in human trials, hence the original UK title WAZ, or the killing gene.

The director wanted to preserve a European feel to the film, as opposed to a big budget glossy Hollywood production. He succeeded, making a darker, grittier, seedier flick than a Hollywood production, although I found the dialogue a bit hard to decipher at the beginning of the film, especially with Stellan Skarsgard's accent.

Skarsgard is an accomplished actor, captured the persona of a gruff brooding NYPD detective well, so it may have been the attempt to capture background noises of a big city, during exterior shots, that contributed to the effect.

I thought a number of the British actors pulled off a great job as American street tough gangsters, and was surprised to see Selma Blair of Hellboy II with an integral role in the film.

I must caution I gave this film high marks because I had never heard of the film, had diminished expectations, and was pleasantly surprised at the results. If you don't mind a bit of gratuitous violence it works as a psychological thriller, and has a few somewhat predictable plot twists.

They did a great job of fleshing out the script, and made a seamless transition cutting from NYC exterior shots around Harlem's Morningside Heights, capturing the city's skyline and interior shots in Belfast, Ireland

I'm not sure if it was intentional, but some of the NYC street scenes paid homage to Death Wish, with a new twist. I look forward to seeing other films by director Tom Shankland.",1228521600,2,2356,4.701456310679611

It's a tricky genre to get right, and Killer Gene manages to get it about three-quarters right with interesting characters and an intriguing motivation for the action.  But something about the plotting and the artificiality of ""science"" introduced into the story prevents ""Gene"" from joining the upper ranks.  A diverting enough film, certainly more intelligent and engaging than, say, Untraceable, but in the words of Maxwell Smart, it missed it by ""that much.""",1221436800,,574,5.021052631578947
3371701,3,B00151QY9Y,"""The Killing Gene"" stars Melissa George as rookie detective Helen O'Mara who is paired with veteran Eddie Argo [Stellan Skarsgard] who is reputed to be a by-the-book cop. They find themselves on the trail of a mysterious killer who seems to target members of a local gang notorious for their acts of violence, each of whom is murdered and carved with ""W Delta Z"". As they dig deeper, they find that the killings are all related and Helen's in-depth investigation reveals a troubling aspect to the case that is linked to an old case, one which Det Argo would rather not revisit.

This is quite a compelling thriller that makes the viewer think and try to sort out the clues that reveal the motives behind the gruesome murders. There are scenes of torture here that are reminiscent of movies like Saw and Hostel, and disturbingly one involving a kid. The basic premise here has to do with retribution, and this theme is truly convincingly portrayed. The two leads as portrayed by Skarsgard and George are credible in their roles, especially Skarsgard, and finally, there is Selma Blair in one of the most intense roles of her career thus far. Without revealing too much of the plot, I would recommend this movie for those who like compelling thrillers with twists.",1219190400,16,1262,4.762557077625571
3371702,2,B00151QY9Y,"What previews and clips I'd seen of The Killing Gene (also known as W Delta Z) made the film look like a bit more brutal variation of Seven, which seemed interesting enough.  Sadly, this is far from being anywhere close to that classic thriller, or practically anything else in the genre either for that matter.  The Killing Gene stars Stellan Skarsgard (Good Will Hunting, Deep Blue Sea, the original Insomnia) and Melissa George (30 Days of Night, Turistas, Amityville Horror) as cops investigating a bizarre murder in which a victim had an unusual mathematical formula carved into her body.  Soon enough, more bodies begin piling up, leading to some revelations and more bloody mayhem.  Nearly every bit of momentum that The Killing Gene manages to build up gets squandered, as what could have been an intense, psychological drama instead gets relegated into a torture flick that borrows heavily from all the Saw's and Hostel's to come before it.  That being said, most of The Killing Gene is an exercise in sadism that could have been something more, but instead is a sadly disappointing bore with an ending that will definitely make you squirm (and what happens here is something that has definitely been seen a little too much in these types of flicks as of late).  Skarsgard and George are good in the leads, as are Selma Blair, Ashley Walters, and Tom Hardy in smaller roles.  All in all, if the torture brand of the horror genre is your thing, you'll more than likely dig The Killing Gene, but for those of us who thought that this would be a good psychological thriller with some edge, you're better off looking elsewhere.",1219017600,3,1632,4.786476868327402

And I don't know if there is such a thing as a 'make everything green and look like an abandoned bathroom at a rest stop in Ecuador' filter that they have for cameras now, but the entire movie looks like it. You know how all the walls looked in 'Saw'? Every surface, place, person, and thing looks like that in this movie.

The dialogue is sparse but still awful. People's emotions rarely match what you think they should feel. There's almost no music of any kind through the whole movie. Nothing anyone does make any sense.

At one point, the two main cops go to a gang members house, talk to him for awhile. find out he killled his grandmother after being released by the killer, got a few fingers chopped off, then they leave. As they leave, they see rival gang members who are clearly going to go up to the apartment they just vacated and kill the guy living there, and then they just....leave.
Confused? Good. Me too. The whole movie is like this.

There are a few things that are not as awful. It is an intricate plot, and some parts of it weave well together when the characters talk coherently. Stellan Skarsgaard is good at looking very pissed off all the time. Selma Blair pulls off creepy murder genius with a good deal of pinache, even though she looks dead on the inside. Also, Tom Hardy is in it.

Overall, if you like really gross torture scenes and special features about goreporn torture scenes, then this movie might fair better under your eye. But I already donated my copy to goodwill and never plan to think about this movie again.",1357948800,,1765,4.404907975460123

3371765,4,B00151QY9Y,"I saw this film for the second time about two years ago. The first viewing blew my mind. While there is some heavy-handedness in the film, in general this borders on a great thriller. It is one of the best such films I've seen. It has great suspense which builds and builds until the murderer, who becomes known, reveals the motive for a horrific payback for the gang's crimes.

The premise of the story is intriguing. Members of a violent (and markedly amoral) gang are being murdered, and the murderer has etched WdeltaZ into the bodies. The ""formula"" refers to a theory of imprinted human behavior which causes man to exhibit ""abnormal"" behaviors in intraspecies; these behaviors are humiliation, violence and killing. (See Konrad Lorenz' On Aggression, a layman's book based on his scientific, Nobel-prize winning work. I think this has got to be one of the sources the screenwriter used from his Psychology 101 course!) In the beginning of the film, in an animal experimentation lab, we are given this premise of innate aggression among primates.

Two detectives are assigned to the gang deaths, one a seasoned veteran and the other a rookie. The lead detective is haunted by a case of rape and murder which he failed to solve. This failure prompts his intense desire to solve the current crimes. Though Skarsgaard and George are competent in their detective roles, I found the other characters, especially Pierre ( the always remarkable Tom Hardy), more compelling. Selma Blair's is the single truly outstanding performance.

  SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!

In 1961, a study on human behavior known as ""The Milgram Experiment"" was conducted.  It created a firestorm of controversy. The screenwriter was no doubt familiar with this widely publicized experiment, too. The experiment involved two randomly selected people who were told they would be paid for playing roles of teacher and student. The teacher would ask questions, and if the student answered the question incorrectly, the teacher would apply electrical shocks from 15 volts to 450 volts. The administrator and the learner were conductors of the experiment -- only the ""teacher"" had no knowledge of the real purpose of the study.  The ""teacher"" could not see the ""learner,"" only the electric shock generator. The objective of the experiment was to determine the extent of pain one person would inflict upon another. The researchers wanted to know how long someone would continue to give shocks to another person if they were told to do so even if the shock would seriously hurt him [Stanley Milgram]. As the voltage increased from 15 to 450 volts, 65 percent of the ""teachers"" applied full voltage three times. (The researchers had expected between 1 to 2 per cent of the ""teachers"" to inflict the highest pain.) The ""learner"" played an audio tape of increasingly painful outbursts until the last three charges when the response was silence. Whenever the ""teacher"" wanted to stop, the administrator said he could not stop,,with increasing pressure of mild statement to stern command, he was ordered to continue to increase the shocks until the study ended. That 65 per cent of the ""teachers"" obeyed the administrator was an outcome totally unexpected by the administrators.

Now why am I going into all this psychological stuff? Because it has everything to do with the storyline especially in the resolution of the conflict.  What causes the behavior of the gang members to  inflict extreme violence upon others? Is it in our nature -- or in our nurture? What causes the behavior of the victim who delivers the payback for their crimes? Revenge in a hideously cruel punishment -- or in the imitation of the violence inflicted upon the victims? The film provokes some heavy thought, that's for sure.

I wrote this review not so much to comment on the story, which I think has been pretty much covered by others here, but to write about the underpinnings of the screenplay. I don't know if the screenwriter is familiar with the behavioral theories above, but I think he must be. I saw clear similarities between the facts and fiction of aggression in human behavior.  The conclusion of the film is brutally graphic. I remember thinking, omg, how can one person do that to another?! Isn't the payback a bit of overkill? But, looking at the provocation for the revenge, the same question came to mind. At some points, I felt my stomach tighten. It is not just the physical ""Q&A"" in the final scenes that appalls us but the terrible consequences meted out for ""wrong answers."" Rather than endure more physical pain, Pierre, for example, gives up the one person who loves him and whom he loves: his grandmother. What is the film saying when it leaves us feeling that certain punishments, no matter how cruel, are perfectly justified? Brrrrrr. Goosebumps!
I really like this movie. I have it in my collection, and after writing this ""review,"" I think I'll watch it again tomorrow!
PS: I ought to state that the Milgram Experiment's original purpose was to examine the motivation for war crimes committed by the Nazis during WWII, specifically, the explanation that the torturers were ""only following orders.""",1323302400,,5159,4.977932636469222

Instead of going to get revenge with his gang, he just hangs himself. That didn't make sense to me.

The acting was so-so by everyone in the film. Nobody's performance stands out to me.

However, her stooping to take this role is not worth the rent payment. I guessed what lurked beneath Stellan Skarsgard's character after 30 minutes, and Ashley Walter's detective is -- as with so many female detective characters -- relegated to playing catch-up and proving her worth.

I kept waiting for a surprise partner because it just didn't seem feasible for the murderer to do it all.

The plot of the film is Saw-like in nature, how much would you go through to save your loved one until you finally just flip the switch (literally) and let them die to end your own agony? The serial killer is targeting a gang of thugs, who ""inspired"" the killer after their owb brutal gang rape, torture, and murder of the victim's family member. Fast forward several years (?), and one by one this group is getting brutally tortured and killed along with a loved one.

Questions, why let the supposed ring leader of the crime go? If you're out for revenge for a horrific crime, wouldn't you punish the ring leader the most? I get it, he killed his loved one quickly and didn't endure as much pain as the others, but I don't see why you would let them just walk away. He didn't seem to have much guilt so the killer was just set to let him live the rest of his gang leader days, what?! The killer also let another of her rapists go with the body of their loved one, again, I was like what?! I felt bad for all of the loved ones that had to die, but the gang all had it coming.

There was also a little bit of old school versus new school in the police force. I know Stellan Skarsgard is a good actor, but he seemed to be phoning it in. Melissa George was also not entirely believable as the lone female, let alone rookie, detective in a precinct full of idiots. So the cop storyline fell flat for me. There was also a massive plot twist that I didn't see coming that left me kind of glad that ALL of the bad guys were taken out in some way...I foresee the lone female survivor will probably end herself by overdose.

  Selma Blair seems miscast. Is that sweet thing capable of all that bloodletting? She looks more like the type who would forgive her assailants and pray for their salvation.
  The story was maybe a little predictable and it might have benefited from being straight noir without the ""love blooms at night, in daylight it dies""
