4227906,4,B003Y7TJXA,"I loved this series when it originally aired on television.  I agree with reviewer RJ Grimm that Richard Eden is second only to Peter Weller as the best actor to play Robocop.  Yvette Nipar also did a good job as Detective Lisa Madigan.  There are some great guest villains here too like wrestler Roddy Piper as Commander Cash and Cliff De Young as Dr. Cray Z. Mollardo.  It was also wonderful to see former ""Adam 12"" star Martin Milner as Alex Murphy's father.

As for the bad, this is the worst DVD packaging I have ever seen.  All six discs are in the same compartment with plastic slots instead of spindles to hold the discs.  All of the discs had become dislodged in shipping and were badly scratched.  I hope they will play OK without skipping but I seriously doubt it.",1313193600,3,775,4.446808510638298
4227907,4,B003Y7TJXA,"Cool series, the box set included all the episodes aired in the 90's, they are worth watching, although the series can be a little silly at times, these episodes are much better than the prime directives series that came out later on.
Bought the boxset here at Amazon.  I got my boxset in mint condition, great product.  Great service.",1308960000,,335,4.661016949152542
4227908,5,B003Y7TJXA,"I recently purchased this unsure if this was a crappy bootleg title as its the only one around anywhere!
well i am here to say its legit and the quality is fantastic! the collectors box is awesome with great pictures the DVDs are held well inside and play great!

now about the content
another reviewer has said ""Robocop does not use his Gun"" well that's not true... he just doesn't blow anyone away or do the usual Robocop thing like in the movies... well first off this is a TV show and aired at about 7:30 pm... i watched this as a kid along with the Flash TV series (its Awesome also)this was made in like 1990 so you cant really expect it to be to violent... remember they didn't say ""Bi*ch"" on TV back then.
and the ""ghost"" he was talking about is a tad different than what hes saying its a human brain merged with a computer and the persons personality is in the computer... not that much different than a robot made with a human brain where the personality still exists... so if you can buy RoboCop this idea isn't that far fetched.
now I am a huge RoboCop fan and I own all the DVDs for RoboCop (Robocop 1-3 Robocop prime directives and obviously Robocop the TV series) and out of all 5 of Actors to play RoboCop Richard Eden I feel is the Second best Actor to play RoboCop after Peter Weller except for one thing... he looks awful without the helmet on... hes got no chin and they give him the palest clammy looking makeup ever!

The series is a bit campy but lost of Fun It holds true to the original RoboCop with lost of goofy and messed up Media Break segments and Cartoon much like the Johnny Rehab Cartoon from RoboCop 3 so lost of fun and messed up RoboCop humor. Again bare in mind TV SHOW so not violently over the top as the Robocop theatrical films

If your a RoboCop fan and you didn't totally hate RoboCop 3 than you should have fun with this.",1289779200,25,1865,4.247887323943662
4227909,2,B003Y7TJXA,This is a tv series that lasted one year. This is a below average tv show. Robocop does not use his gun during the season. Think Robocop 3 with less plot and no action. I'm not saying don't get this series but be prepared for the worst and you will do ok. The ghost ( that's right a ghost) that helps Robocop was a silly idea. Nice to see it out on dvd though.,1288483200,5,360,3.8783783783783785

4227921,5,B003Y7TJXA,"When I ordered this set I was skeptical not because of the content but because of the packaging. The series was as I remembered. It was good and was and OK tie-in to the movies. It takes place in between part 1 and part 2 movies. Since this series is a little more kid friendly he doesn't kill anyone (not saying that nobody dies on the show, just saying he doesn't do the killing) it loosely follows part 2 movie when they reprogrammed him to be temporally non-violent. Even though its a sequel to part 1 and a prequel to part 2 my only gripe with it's canon is the fact that they change Key character names one example of this, Officer Ann Lewis name was change to Officer Lisa Madigan. I understand that they did it for copyright reasons (they didn't want to get sued by the people that did the movie franchise) but they had some of the same writers from the movie franchise to write the show so that just didn't make sense to me. Even with that confusion I still like the show. Now on with the packaging I was warned that it was faulty and they made new holders for the discs but that was not the case for me, mines came with the old packaging, you would think it would have been recalled by now but that goes to show just how money hungry the company that manufacture the DVD casing is, (Like OCP and their ED 209 LOL!!!).  Why 5 Stars you asked?  Because I was lucky enough to receive it with the discs still in there place, make no mistake it is the faulty design version that I received but none of the discs were scratch and they where in there proper place but if you knock the case slightly they can easily fall out. Luckily mine was marked as fragile handle with care but this severs as a warning, you are taking a gamble if you are going to buy this set it is like playing Russian roulette you won't know which one you're going to get until it arrives at your door step.",1406332800,2,1883,4.184573002754821

4227923,5,B003Y7TJXA,I have always liked the Robocop movies and TV series. My family likes the original movie better than the new version.,1403136000,,117,4.619047619047619
4227924,5,B003Y7TJXA,"Everyone is talking about the horrible packaging for this. I guess I lucked out because the version I just bought has good packaging.

It came in a standard size DVD case with a cardboard sleeve on the outside. When you open it, there are 6 disks. The one I got has 2 plastic leaves inside. A disk fits into each side of the inside covers, and one front and back on each leaf.

The disks in mine did not arrive loose, and there weren't any scratches on any of them. So it looks like they fixed the packaging. But since this item is actually out of print and is only offered through Amazon marketplace sellers, there's unfortunately no guarantee which version you will get if you order this! (If it helps any, the seller I used was ""kylakins"".)

As for the show itself, I like it. It is dark and moody. Not that violent, but this was before much of that was allowed on network TV so what can you do? This show is very much a child of the 80's, product of the 90's. And so am I, so I'm okay with that!

It is getting more expensive and harder to find these days. The good thing about Amazon is their customer service absolutely rocks if you ever have a problem with your order and need to return something. (No, they didn't pay me to say that :) Good luck, and enjoy!",1400630400,,1265,4.193415637860082

4227926,2,B003Y7TJXA,Low rating mostlh based on cheap packaging. My discs had popped out of the cheap case and were loose and scuffed. I read the packaging had been fixed..this is not true. Have to check the discs to see if they play..... As for the content.. Gotten thru to disk 2.. Video on the later episodes get very dark..i had to crank up the brightness to see the inside shots... Comment on show... This show should be called depressed robocop... Thats the only emotion he has... That plus the fact he never shoots anyone ..makes for an odd show... He points his gun a lot...shoots boxes...cables..stairs...but never the bad guys... Mostly he tells them that they are under arrest and then they run away..still nice to have more robo content and it is way better that the prime directive miniseries,1393027200,,784,4.64748201438849

4227930,1,B003Y7TJXA,I would not recommend this set to anyone. The case is cheap and the little plastic clips will not hold the discs in place. Had several discs so severly scratched they kept freezing up. This was a good series but Alliance did not do a good job on the packaging.,1370908800,,260,4.22

4227932,4,B003Y7TJXA,Forgot how much I liked this show. It does drift a little from the movie version with his son and wife still around and he has a chance to interact with them. I like the song by Joe Walsh on the later disk.,1361923200,,206,3.813953488372093
4227933,4,B003Y7TJXA,"Continuing the kid-friendly theme from Robocop 3 don't mistake this as a pass. A great job by the actor portraying Robocop and good effects for a 90s tv show and some episodes like ""What Money Cant Buy"" is kinda really well done. The suit looks great and the actor is tall so Robocop has this feel as if he's really a robot. The supporting cast is great and do a well job in this series. My only grief is when Robocop removes the helmet, it just looks weird but not a major problem. If your a fan of Robocop you should get this. Works well iintroducing the character to younger viewers and something new to returning fans if the first 3 films are getting a tad repetitive. Also check out Robocop Prime Directives for more Robocop entertainment, the Prime Directives is not for younger viewers.",1359158400,,793,4.475862068965517

4227935,1,B003Y7TJXA,"I have had to return this set FOUR times due to discs not playing correctly. People on here are saying the discs are getting scratched due to the poor design of the disc holders in the package.  That could be, but whatever the cause, at least THREE OUT OF SIX discs in every set I got DID NOT PLAY PROPERLY. I am going to return it yet again and order another one.  Each time I keep the discs that work and send back the ones that don't.  I have yet to get a disc one that works. I like the show, but this is an awful lot of effort to go through to get a compete set that works. They need some quality control at the place that manufactured these discs.",1329177600,6,653,3.969465648854962
4227936,1,B003Y7TJXA,"Ive owned thousands of DVDs, seems the trend lately is to come up with the most damaging packaging possible to ensure the buyer will need to purchase the dvds again. I love Robocop so im thankful this exists, so I have nothing but praise on the TV Show. But I want to warn future buyers, this packaging has no securing of the DVDs like normal cases, Ive never seen a set like this, it has 6 discs in a booklet, but instead of using the normal center holders like most dvd cases use, its has a set of 9 little fingers that are suppose to hold the Dvds in place from the sides of the dvd using tension only. Whoever designed this needs to be fired, out of all the dvd packaging ive seen this is the worst ever.

Needless to say brand new in shrinkwrap, when I opened this dvd set, all the dvds spilled and were loose and scratching up inside there case the entire time while in shrinkwrap. When I sell this back to Amazon, ill be lucky to get Good condition on brand new DVDs, they look used and scratched and they are suppose to be brand new. So beware you would be better off buying this used, it will be just as scuffed up as a new set. This kind of packaging just begs for digital media files instead of DVDs or Blu Ray. Come on manufactures lets skip making dvds and just make digital copies instead so our media can be safe on a hard drive vs scuffed media. This is the worst case ever designed.",1328745600,3,1399,4.143382352941177
4227937,2,B003Y7TJXA,"This isn't a bad show, or a great show, it's just alright. Any RoboCop fan will most likely enjoy it. However, the packaging is absolutely horrendous. I have never before seen the strange disc-holders this show uses, and I'm sure I never will again. As soon as I slid the disc-holding portion of the box out of the cover and opened the book-style cover, all six discs immediately fell out and hit the floor. When I tried to put them back inside, every single one of the disc-holding ""flippers"" (I really don't know any other way to describe them, they look like curved versions of the flippers in a pinball machine) snapped the instant I tried to secure a disc inside.

This is absolutely the worst packaging I've ever seen for any multi-disc DVD set.

Based on the show alone, I would have given this four stars, but the absolutely inexcusable packaging deducts a full two stars.",1325721600,3,880,4.598726114649682
4227938,4,B003Y7TJXA,"I'm not sure why this series has pretty much been forgotten.  It was a legitimate attempt to continue the Robocop universe, just on a smaller scale.  Sure, it's a t.v. series and you won't get Paul Vehoeven's penchant for ultra-violence, so prevalent in the original film.  You also don't get Irwin Kershner's disregard for character development (Robocop 2) or anything as stupid as a robot ninja (Robocop 3).  In fact, if you ignore those 2 sequels, the feature-length series pilot here serves as a decent sequel.  It was even written by the writers of the original film.

Some have lamented the tone-downed violence, a necessary concession for television standards.  But really, if all you got out of the original film was a robot ""Dirty Harry"" blowing away the bad guys, you missed a lot.  Like some biting satire and first-rate science fiction...both of which are present in this series.  Production values are generally good, although Delta City's CGI backdrops haven't aged well.  Richard Eden is fine as Robocop, and gets adequate support from the rest of the cast (whatever happened to Andrea Roth, who plays Diana?).

As others have noted, the only real drawback to this set is some of the worst packaging ever devised.  Two sets of 3 discs are staggered in a cheap plastic holder which broke the minute I took out the first disc.  With all the options available for storage these days, there's really no excuse for it.  Paramount, for example, manages to get 6-disc full-season sets of shows in a standard size DVD case, with no discs touching each other and individual hubs for each disc.

If you missed this one--and chances are pretty good you did--but enjoy the fictional future Detroit envisioned by Robocop's creators, give this show a try.  I think you'll find it isn't all that different from the original film in a lot of ways.",1323648000,11,1846,4.8312101910828025
4227939,5,B003Y7TJXA,"I loved this series when it was on. I taped them in the 90s and watched them over and over again. Of course I took breaks 6 or 12 months. The sound and picture are awsome. although I didn't like RoboCop 3 that much, this is much improved. I liked the prime directives as well. The Alpha Commando cartoon was awful and an insult to the robocop universe. I used to watch this with Time Trax, {Where is that?} and Star Trek: TNG, DS9. It's nice to have the series on dvd and fits into the sci-fi tv universe really well. So get this and all RoboCop fans would enjoy this. The only thing I didn't like is the packaging. That was AWFUL. I have to keep the discs in white sleeves to keep them from getting scratched and trashed. Up top of all that my Disc 1 doesn't work. I agree with the other reviewer who said it takes 2 much effort to get a working set of this show. I'll just keep what I got and wait for the US release. By the way WHERE IS TIME TRAX?
  Well I have an update, I just bought it again and it seems to work OK for now anyway. I also got it in defferent packageing. It came in a flip case like the Mannix sets come in. The discs work good so far and they look in good shape and not scratched. I don't know how I lucked into this packaging, but I;m glad I did. I don't know what advice to give on this set to purchase.",1316217600,6,1329,3.936802973977695

8408896,3,B003Y7TJXA,"RoboCop: The Series is a 22-episode ,1994 Canadian television series based on the films, specifically, the series takes place between RoboCop 1 and 2. Richard Eden plays RoboCop in this version. Canada's Skyvision Entertainment paid $500,000 cash to Orion Pictures for TV licensing rights. The show is know for being made to appeal primarily to children and young teenagers, lacking the graphic violence that was the hallmark of the original film. The pilot episode is remembered for being adapted from a discarded RoboCop 2 script, Corporate Wars, by the writers of the original RoboCop, Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner.

It does seem a bit silly that Robocop has non-lethal ways of dispatching criminals at times, and even young teens that remember the original film will be upset at the kid-friendly aspect of the show. Its not a bad show, apparently being rather expensive to produce at the time (up to $1.5 million per episode), but its rather lackluster to watch nowadays. It can be entertaining, but it really lacks any inspiration. Some other film characters return but their names were changed for legal reasons.

Not to be confused with RoboCop: Prime Directives, the 2001 Canadian TV, 4 episode miniseries. Page Fletcher plays RoboCop in this series. Fireworks Entertainment was about to have the RoboCop license expire so they rushed this miniseries into production. It consisted of four feature-length (95 min) episodes: Dark Justice, Meltdown, Resurrection, and Crash and Burn. You can find them all listed separately on Amazon, but you can still find them. I actually recommend RoboCop: Prime Directives instead, directed by Julian Grant. The family-friendly TV 1994 series held no interest to Grant, and he returned RoboCop to his dark and more violent roots. Prime Directives takes place ten years after the original film, and ignores all events from RoboCop 2 and 3. It defiantly stands up better than the kid-friendly series, but it has been often criticized for its low-budget look (special effects, locations, action sequences, and so on).

Prime Directives premiered in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel to lackluster ratings at the time. I still recommend it over the other live-action series, though collectors will want them both anyway. Lets just ignore the animated RoboCop series at the moment :)",1467849600,4,2332,5.180371352785146
8408897,3,B003Y7TJXA,"Even though this series was extremely cheesy, I really enjoyed it.  There are some great guest villains like Roddy Piper as Commander Cash.  I also loved that former ""Adam 12"" star Martin Milner was cast as Murphy's father.  Richard Eden does a great job portraying Robocop too.

I did some research prior to purchasing this Blu-ray.  There are 3 versions available, all of which are from Germany.  Only the one listed as a 2 disc set contains English audio.  Also, the discs are in PAL format so unless you have an all-region Blu-ray player or a player capable of playing PAL discs, this will not work.

All episodes are on one Blu-ray disc so don't be expecting anything near typical Blu-ray quality due to the compression that had to be used.  The second disc in the set is a DVD which only includes the extras.",1466726400,,814,4.558620689655172
