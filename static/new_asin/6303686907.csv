724613,3,6303686907,"This is a movie that most WWII film buffs will enjoy.
For once, American forces are exposed as being ill-led and vulnerable during at least one major conflict (The battle at the Salerno beach-head is another example of an Allied debacle).
The German forces are depicted as a worthy, well-equipped, veteran opponent.
There are some problems with the plot and the characters. For example, only one minute of footage is dedicated to the eventual break-out from the Anzio beach-head by the Allied forces. Also, Peter Falk is completely unbelievable as an elite Canadian Commando (""The Black Devils"").
Finally, the firefight between the survivors of the American Rangers against 4 German snipers would have been a no-contest in reality. The Germans would have shot every man dead (i.e. Falk, Mitchum, Holliman,...) within a range of at least 100 meters.
All flaws put aside, ANZIO is still an enjoyable movie to watch because of the beautiful Italian locations, the excellent cinematography, and the decent acting from Mitchum and others.",1041811200,6,1033,5.191616766467066
724614,4,6303686907,"Anzio is a decent WW2 movie as far as this genre goes.  For a change we see the Allies, and in this case, the elite Rangers getting wiped out at Cisterna by the Germans.  I suspect this happened more often than not whenever ameteur American troops had to face the Wehrmacht in anything resembling even-odds.  Robert Mitchum is his usual out-spoken self, while Peter Faulk is an amusing low-life GI character.  The rest of the cast is adequate, if your standard GI fare.  The real strength of the movie is showing how the Americans missed a gold chance at Anzio.  General Lucas was certainly a hesitant commander in an American army that was normally made up of blood and guts types.  No doubt he did not press hard enough in the early stages of the landings, and for a change we can see the Americans being faulted with lack of drive, instead of this role being often shoved onto the British.
The Rangers getting shot-up at Cisterna is well done.  The German tanks are not accurate, looking like the usual modern American stuff pressed into Wehrmacht service, but at least with the camoflauge they look somewhat convincing.  The Sniper scene towards the end is probably the best action sequence in the entire movie.  Here you get to see how a squad of GIs take on elite snipers.
While the acting and plot are par, the movie overall conveys some grim realities of war and shows what a difficult time the Allies had in Italy.  The scenes with Kesselring are brief, but show the contrast between efficient, professional German leadership, and the clumsy, rough and ready manner of the Americans.  Deffinitely a worthwhile movie which creates a convincing atmosphere and has pretty good music as well.  Compared to something like Devil's Briagde or Dirty Dozen which were made in the same period its down-right brilliant!",1039737600,5,1817,4.748407643312102
724615,3,6303686907,"If ANZIO were recut from the original negative, equipped with new sound effects, and included a reworked score by John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith it would have the potential for becoming a great film.  Indeed, when it was originally released, ANZIO appeared in several versions for American, Italian and general European audiences.

ANZIO has potential.  Loosely based on the 1944 Allied landings at Anzio-Nettuno, the film strays into the traditional Italian lament that the Italians were victims of Axis and Allies alike.  This is not surprising as the movie is a product of veteran Hollywood director Edward Dmytryk (Back to Bataan, The Caine Mutiny) and Italian mega producer Dino De Laurentiis.  Indeed, a good portion of the movie was shot on De Laurentiis' estate.

Included are a superb cast who unfortunately flounder with a bad script.  Indeed, Robert Mitchum's biography notes that there was hardly a script at all.  Robert Mitchum leads the cast playing the role of an internationally reknown war correspondent who is driven to determine why men go to war.  Mitchum's character, Dick Ennis, attaches himself to an infantry squad that finds itself cut off behind enemy lines.  Costarring in the film are a pre-Columbo Peter Falk, post western film star Earl Holiman, Robert Ryan, and Arthur Kennedy.  Also look for young Reni Santoni who would later make a name for himself as Clint Eastwood's partner in DIRTY HARRY.  Wolfgang Preiss does a splendid job, albeit in the few minutes alotted to him, portraying German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring.

The film does have its moments.  The landings at Anzio are faithfully recreated with the assistance of footage from contemporary US amphibious landing manuevers -- not unlike the similar footage secured by Daryl Zanuck for THE LONGEST DAY.  The ambush of US Rangers at Cisterna is also pretty spectacular.  As with most De Laurentiis films, look for a big production with cast of thousands.  If you are a collector of war films, then the DVD version of this film -- complete in wide screen -- should find its way into your collection, but you should also read a good book on the subject before accepting this film as history.",1029628800,6,2187,5.013850415512465
724616,4,6303686907,"With the current crop of recent WWII films being pumped out of Hollywood, ANZIO remains often over-looked by many yet remains a classic. As a former Hollywood production assistant and professional film enthusiast, I have written many articles concerning the work of various actors.  ANZIO, starring Mitchum and Peter Falk, features the underrated Earl Holliman. Holliman,still alive and well, is best remembered for his role in the 1970s POLICE WOMAN television series with Angie Dickinson. Holliman fans can also see more of his fine work in THE RAINMAKER(Burt Lancaster) GIANT(James Dean) and THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER(John Wayne) and the recent DVD release of another fine war film set during the Korean War, THE BRIGDES OF TOKO RI which placed Earl Holliman alongside the great William Holden. ANZIO was one of the better war films of the late 1960s  with a well-written screenplay.  This film reminds you that writing and acting was plenty to entertain the audience long before computer generated battle scenes existed.",1024617600,4,1022,5.219512195121951
724617,4,6303686907,"CONCERNING THE DVD:
This is a pretty fair package from Columbia Pictures.  It contains a nicely restored widescreen presentation of the film in its entirety, and in the correct 2.35:1 ratio with sharp, vibrant images.  The French 2.0 surround track has more kick and dimensionality than the original English mono track.  Special features include some rough-looking trailers for this film and a handful of other WWII movies, as well as subtitles in several languages. You can also find a full-screen transfer on the opposite side of the disc.

CONCERNING THE FILM:
(from my website, [...])

American director Edward Dmytryk headed to Italy to shoot ""Anzio"", one the most lopsided World War II epics to come out of the 1960s. Despite some good intentions, this film fails as both an anti-war drama and an action piece.

The film stars Robert Mitchum (""The Enemy Below"") as Dick Ennis, a cold and cynical war correspondent that does his work on the front lines with the infantrymen. When the squad he is accompanying gets cut off behind the German lines due to an ambush, he must pick up a gun and help them fight their way back to Allied lines.

The movie has a lot going for it, right from the start. Every actor looks comfortable, especially Mitchum. Robert Mitchum has never been one of my favorite American actors, simply because he always seems to be acting - despite the dimensionality of the part, Mitchum can never seem to break out of a box. Here, he looks to be having plenty of fun and seems quite natural in the role. Mark Damon (""Between Heaven and Hell"") provides the necessary dramatic opposite as an infantryman who can't seem to agree with Ennis on his policies. Arthur Kennedy (""Attack and Retreat)"") is the exact opposite of Ennis' character as the incompetent General Lesley, who takes too much time establishing a solid beachhead and allows the Germans to launch an offensive, pinning his men down on the beach. Peter Falk (""Situation Normal, All Fouled Up""), on the other hand, is totally wasted as Corporal Rabinoff, a soldier who has become addicted to combat. Earl Holliman (""Armored Command"") is the Sergeant in command of the squad, and he makes the most out of a clich?d-role by giving his character personality. Be sure to watch for Robert Ryan, Anthony Steel, Arthur Franz and Patrick Magee as Allied Generals.

There is only one big battle sequence, which expertly staged and filled with tanks, extras and big explosions. However, its effectiveness is limited because of two key flaws. Primarily, American soldiers are seen to stand up in the open and rush German machine-gun nests, only to be mowed down by overwhelming enemy fire. Secondly, there's a ridiculous scene in which Ennis and a soldier engage in a discussion about the war right in the middle of a fight, despite the fact that bullets and artillery shells are landing all around them! The final, small-scale, climactic showdown with German snipers was much more suspenseful, due to some excellent editing and great music score.

One major flaw in the film is, unfortunately, the script. It's as if ""Anzio"" can't decide if it wants to be a gung-ho flag-waver, or a downbeat, anti-war story. The first half the film is filled with humorous, almost slapstick scenes, although some of Mitchum's dialog hints that this is going to change ... and it does, in fact the focus turns around 180 degrees. Throughout the second half of the film, the action stops dead in its tracks so that the characters discuss issues of personal sacrifice, what constitutes above and beyond the call of duty, etc... until it's been repeated so much that you can't stand to hear anymore. For all of this discussion, the conclusion is pretty forced. Mitchum says something along the lines of, ""Men kill each other because they like to. Maybe if we all sit back and realize it, we could stop the killing and get along."" That statement defines over-emphasis. Instead of being a history lesson about the real Anzio campaign, the film turns into a social commentary on Vietnam.

The on-location shooting served the proceedings well, as the film looks like sunny Italy in every frame. The scene in the Italian house looked excellent, and Dmytryk uses wide angles throughout to show off the scope of the Italian locales. The score ranges from victorious and rousing to mournful and depressing, which contributes a great deal to the mood of some important scenes - such as the entry into liberated Rome and the significance of one character's death in the sniper sequence.

""Anzio"" is a mixed bag, but despite a lack of focus on one central theme, it manages to be entertaining and satisfying as a drama, with enough well-staged action scenes to hold it together and help obscure the muddled anti-war sentiments.

OH.  David Janssen DID NOT appear in this film, contrary to the belief of many viewers, who may have this title confused with INCHON! (released in 1980)",1014940800,21,4923,4.860381861575179
724618,2,6303686907,"The 1944 Allied landings at Anzio were more or less a mistake, and so would be buying this film. Although it has a solid cast and some nice moments with Robert Mitchum, Peter Falk and Wolfgang Preiss, it has a phony feel that goes beyond the historical innacuracies and the annoying tendency of late 1960s war movies to outfit all sides with the same kind of tanks, painted different colors. The film is sluggishly paced, overly preachy -- I know it was Vietnam-era, but not all generals are fools and sociopaths -- and battle scenes are few and far between. What should be the big moment, where the Germans ambush and annihilate the 1st and 3rd U.S. Ranger battalions, is ineptly directed. The film is not really about Anzio at all: it is about Mitchum's disillusioned war-correspondent and a misfit crew of GIs who have to make it back to American lines following the disaster. The only good combat sequence is at the end when Mitchum, Falk and company tackle three German snipers, but by then it is too late. Mitchum was in a lot of good WWII films, but baby, this ain't one of 'em.",1010361600,5,1085,4.540816326530612
724619,4,6303686907,"The Allied landing at Anzio was not unopposed. Allied forces were bogged down in trench fighting for almost three weeks before they could move inland against the Germans. In this film facts get turned around but the basic story is intriguing. A rather stoic Robert Mitchum plays a pacifist battle-hardened war correspondent who must come to grips with his own convictions. Under Edward Dmytryk's direction Mitchum's character seems to have more military smarts than the professionals do, thus making his character a bit of a conundrum.  That's what makes this film so interesting. Peter Falk, Earl Holliman and Reni Santoni  are good as the stereotypical GIs that Mitchum goes out on patrol and has to fight his way back with. Riz Ortolani created a good suspenseful score and there are some really good action sequences. The good cast, which is a great asset, includes Robert Ryan, Arthur Kennedy, Patrick Magee and Mark Damon.",994204800,25,928,5.0588235294117645

724784,4,6303686907,"RELEASED IN 1968 and directed by Edward Dmytryk & Duilio Coletti, ""Anzio"" (aka The Battle of Anzio) chronicles the uneventful Allied amphibious landing at Anzio, Italy, in late January, 1944. While a reconnaissance detail offers evidence that theres no serious enemy opposition in the 30 miles between Anzio and Rome, the commander (Arthur Kennedy) inexplicably decides to dig-in, which provides Field Marshal Kesselring (Wolfgang Preiss) the opportunity to marshal his troops against the invasion. This prolongs their capturing Rome until early June.

Winston Churchill was dissatisfied with this, commenting ""I had hoped we were hurling a wildcat into the shore, but all we got was a stranded whale. The movie focuses on a war correspondent (Robert Mitchum) who accompanies a small group of Rangers who patrol the Italian countryside and are ambushed at the Battle of Cisterna and try to make it back. The soldiers are played by Earl Holliman, Peter Falk, Reni Santoni, et. al.

The movies based on real events, but you can tell that the writers pandered to the audience in light of some of the contrived dialogues, e.g. General Lesley quoting Churchill at the end (Lesley, of course, representing the real-life General Lucas). Another negative is the incongruent soundtrack and score, most notably the opening song by Jack Jones, The World is Yours. Yet it could be argued that this lends the movie a unique charm.

Some armchair critics complain that the movie should have focused more on The Battle of Anzio, as far as the invading Allies fighting Kesselrings counterattack, but thats here to a point (since all the events fall under the umbrella of that battle) and I think they came up with an innovative way to condense 4.5 months into a fairly compelling two hour flick.

THE MOVIE RUNS 117 minutes and was shot entirely in Italy (Naples, Caserta & Rome). WRITERS: H.A.L. Craig (et. al) from Wynford Vaughan-Thomass book. ADDITIONAL CAST: Robert Ryan has a small role.

die. In this rendition, the hero/star survivor, a reporter of course, explains to a well meaning but inept general no less, the meaning of war, ""men just like to kill each other"".

The battle action seemed realistic.  The story is alright and is realistic. While trying to return to Anzio after driving to Rome, Mitchum and those with him observe German soldiers building defenses to protect themselves against the Allies.

American soldiers celebrate in a mansion (owned by the enemy). A reporter visits these soldiers. Others arrive and a fight breaks out. [No MP's around?] Why does that reporter stay there? An officer tells these Rangers to prepare for their next mission. We see Scottish pipers lead soldiers toward the docks; boats await them. Troops with American-style helmets carry Enfield rifles. [The language reveals its European origin.] ""Ciao, ciao, blackbird."" The General tells about the plans to bypass the Cassino line and drive to Rome from the south. They will secure the beachhead. ""War is kill or be killed."" Launching rockets marks the beginning of the invasion. [Where did those rockets come from?] The Rangers are ordered into landing boats to take them ashore.

It's a quiet night, the landing is unopposed. They move further inland. Tanks come ashore too. They will move three miles inland. ""Where are all the Germans?"" The German General asks for troops, some will be removed from the Cassino line. One jeep drives into Rome. The German troops left Rome, only the SS and the military police are left (an Open City). The US General will wait, he suspects a trap. The German Generals prepare, many of their troops are young. They will prepare a strong defense. The US Generals order the Rangers to advance and give them ""merry hell"". Soon they run into camouflaged enemy positions. [No air cover?] The men retreat into a destroyed farmhouse. A minefield bars their path! Throwing rocks creates a path to safety. They see captured Americans and bodies on the ground. A walkie-talkie sends the news to the General. Were men lost because a General was too timid? [What about a strong enemy?]

An airplane flies overhead. One man is joyful. They see trucks with men and construction equipment. What is going on? Is the enemy preparing a trap? Dick Ennis sees what is going on; can he return to the American lines? Yes, a stray dog helps him. Or does it? A captured soldier is shot after he surrenders. The soldiers seek refuge in an abandoned farmhouse. A woman and her daughters are there. They share C-rations. One man suffers pain from an old wound; he re-enlisted. Enemy troops arrive, they search the house. There is shooting. They continue moving until they are blocked. Can they continue? ""I got him!"" Then an airplane flies overhead. ""Welcome to the club, Mr. Ennis!"" When they return Ennis reports the news. ""You did a great job."" Ennis says ""men kill each other because they like to"". [What a comment on mankind!] Next they show spectacular explosions! American troops enter Rome like other conquerors. And so it ends.

725960,5,6303686907,"The movie was a much truer tale of WWII because it was closer to the reality.  Considering the amount of people that disliked it and accused it of being anti-war, it reminds me of the damn fools that enlisted because they thought Viet Nam was a John Wayne movie.

Anzio was about the unbelievable mistakes by the brass that cost the lives of thousands of troops as told by a war correspondent who was trying to understand why men killed each other.  Being the only one left out of a platoon killed off by the Germans because of mistakes and having to defend himself by killing a sniper after nobody else was left to do it, at the end of the movie, one of the Generals that caused many of the deaths asked him if he learned why men killed each other.  He answered, ""Because they like it"" or something similar.

It's a hard fact to face but I've spoken with too many vets that will begrudgingly admit this is true in spite of spending the rest of their lives suffering permanent war injuries.

At least WWII was necessary because Germany and Japan threatened the US.  Viet Nam wasn't.  Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.  Even Afghanistan isn't a real threat but just like WWII, all the deaths and maiming of our troops were and are very real.  Anzio and a few others like it weren't total fabrications as is the norm of Hollywood producers that never saw his buddies turned into mush by a mortar round.

725961,3,6303686907,"I gave it three stars because the performances of Robert Mitchum and Peter Falk were excellent. Besides that, the movie is garbage.
My five poionts:
1. low budget...they used Patton Tanks for both German and American.
2. The Plane that strafes Mitchum and a German has Japanese meatballs on the wings.
3. The movie was made in 1968, the Tet Offensive was in 1968 and American support for the war in Vietnam was turning against involvement when Walter Cronkite expressed his doubts about the war. So this is an anti-war film.
4. At the end of the film, Mitchum says, ""We kill each other because we like to. No wars ever faught were necessary."" Hollywood liberalism at its finest. I guess the writers forgot that the American revolutionary WAR gave them the right to free speech.
5. Hollywood Liberalism: The troops are portrayed as poor, dumb schlubs who have to do and die for ""nothing."" Peter Faulk's character loves war, every bit of it and by doing so, drives home Mitchum's diatribe about how men ""love to kill each other."" Liberals think that the only reason wars exist is because humans love to kill each other. Because, to them (Liberals), they actually believe that no wars ever faught were necessary. The generals are portrayed as warmongering idiots.

The movie is grievously hampered by a quite dreadful script -hang your head in shame Harry AL Craig -which indulges in enough windy,verbose and pompous,sententious sermonising  to put even Al Bore (the spelling is accurate)to shame .The characters ,the GI's in particular are not given dialogue to speak ;they are given ""statements""to make .
It makes the fatal mistake of so many  historical movies-judging the past by the standards of today .By all means use war movies -or any movies for that matter -to raise moral issues but not at the expense of the narrative drive of the movie .Thus we have a picture that takes a while to get going .The action when it arrives is well staged with a sniper duel and a pasage through a minefield especially excitingly done

The performances are sound with solid turns from Arthur Kennedy as General Lesley and Robert Ryan as General Carson .

First, the movie explores WHY men go to war, concluding that the main reason men and societies go to war is because they LIKE killing.  Robert Mitchum's character poses this question to a general early in the film, and the events in the film lead Mitchum to draw this conclusion at the end.

Second, the movie explores the idea that a general can be too timid.  The movie treats us to the timid general's battle plan, which is organized for the reason of having as little loss of human life as possible.  Mitchum's character poses a question to the general using a quote from Napolean, and they discuss the idea.

 Previous reviewers felt very abused by its misleading title. Unlike it's contemporaries ""Tora Tora Tora"", ""Battle of Britain"", ""Longest Day"", or ""Midway"", this ""Anzio"" claims only cursory nods to history. You will not find here little yellow captions introducing each newly-met character, listing name, rank, and historybook significance: ""Major General John Doe, Deputy Commander XIV Corp"".

 The bulk of this movie is clearly *not* about ""Anzio the Historical Campaign"" --

 With so much focus on historically fictional characters, this film could be about *any* group of men, in *any* battle, during *any* war in history, and should be accepted by us on those terms. The time and location are only marginally relevant backdrops for a theme. It's a disconcerting shame that so many become distracted from the story by five letters in stencil-font on a DVD cover. This is not history -- Get over it.

 It is however an understandable distraction. The screenwriter and director profoundly fail to articulate their theme with either clarity or focused skill.
 Beginning with a silly theme-song, appropriate more to cheap Las Vegas nightclubs than to a war movie, we're subsequently walked through an idiotic procession of testosterone-laden scenes of sweating troops doing the Guy Thing --
 Swinging on chandeliers, punching each other out, shouting ""All right you mothers!"", or lecherously eyeing large-breasted women during a joyride behind enemy lines, this cliche-ridden buffoonery could well be accepted as calculated instruction for alienating audiences aged 14 or above. The battle scenes are dusty non-believable hokum which became boring in movies before the VE-Day celebrations.

 Despite that, this is no easy movie to completely dismiss with venomous contempt. For those inclined to look beneath the muck, there is also much which is distinctive and compelling.
 The theme is a simple but interesting one, expressed by Mitchum early in the script:
 "" Why do we do it, why do we kill each other? How can a perfectly ordinary good-natured guy sit in an airplane and bomb a thousand sleeping strangers below? I haven't found an answer.""
 In contrast to this well worn question, a disturbing, and -- for a movie of this ilk -- highly unusual answer comes from Falk, and summmarizes the movie's message:
 "" ...and it's got nothing to do with democracy. Because I like it. I want this. A guy sells shoes for 40 years, and I live more in one day.
 ""I see more, I feel more, I taste more, I think more. I'm more. Do you understand? I'm more.""

 Experience teaches us about ourselves. It demonstrates and corrects misconceptions about ourselves. Of all possible experiences, how many are more emphatic than protracted world war?

 Falk's answer haunts the movie in crisp moments of self-revelation for characters who are other than what they believe themselves to be:
 Mitchum the journalist, outwardly a jaded pacifist, he discovers truth in Falk's telling him, ""You're just like me.""
 Arthur Kennedy as General Lesley, who, by virtue of rank and position should be a master warrior, is in his actions, and despite protestations to the contrary, the film's actual pacifist-at-heart
 These are fine performances rising above a poorly crafted script. But this movie truly belongs to Falk, sympathetically portraying one who has reached self-fulfillment as a man of violence thriving in violent circumstance.

The oft derided scene of Falk teaching ""Bye Bye Blackbird"" to three prostitutes is one of the reasons I purchased the DVD. In a movie where all the primary characters demonstrate some measure of depth and variety in their personalities, this scene balances Falk's killer corporal who loves war. Without it, Falk would simply be a cocky brute; with it he becomes among the men Mitchum describes in the quote above. I admit predjudice here however -- of all versions I've ever heard of this song, this remains my favorite.

 We may easily denigrate this movie for it's obvious bad history, sour direction, and muddled script. But it's equally easy to remain alert to small gems here, shining from the acting of the lead characters deftly pointing to a thought-provoking if stillborn theme, of self revelation during war.",1091145600,16,4715,5.1616294349540075
726054,2,6303686907,"You're in trouble when you begin loathing a movie during the opening credits.  A jeep drops off the a dusty uniformed Robert Mitchum and the camera follows him up a flight of stairs and past a couple of security check points, through some large palace rooms.  There are gigantic paintings on the wall, the wealth of ancient Italy.  We follow him into the first scene of the movie, the opening oh-oh.
 A sizable crowd of American GIs, with a few stray prostitutes here and there, are in a huge hall of the palace.  One soldier hangs from a monster chandelier, while the other soldiers taunt, hoot and throw oranges and such at him.  Apparently he's trying to break a ""How long can you stay on the chandelier"" record.  A herd of ""elite Canadian Rangers"" enter, shepherded by Corporal Peter Falk, and naturally the veggie throwing thugs attack them.  Well, boys will be boys, and I suppose trashing an ancient palace can and should be written off to youthful exuberance.
 Meanwhile, disillusioned journalist Robert Mitchum, kind of the anti-Ernie Pyle in this one, drags a long necked bottle of wine and the cynical sergeant Earl Holliman and makes for the balcony for a moment of intense character exposition.  It looks like they're in a room with a blue mountain scene painted on the tapestry.  I swear I saw Mitchum's shadow on the mountain behind him.  Then battered Corporal Peter Falk enters the balcony, and you see by a reverse shot that they're supposed to be outdoors.  Maybe it worked better on the big screen.
 The movie is about American's invasion of Anzio  as seen through the eyes of a pacifist journalist.  The landing is unopposed, and Mitchum requisitions a jeep and, along with Falk, discover that the road to Rome, the ultimate destination, is open.  Rome can be in Allied hands in a few days, if they move fast enough.
 Allied high command decides to dig in instead, which allows the German's the time to create a Caesar Line to oppose advance.  Some time later Holliman's battalion, with  the un-armed Mitchum along for the story, advances cautiously towards Rome, led by ranger Falk.
 It's too late, of course, (damn timid high command), and most of the battalion is killed or captured.  A handful of them make it and they escape their valley of death by the clever clearing of a mine field.
  Frankly, the script is a mess.  There are references made to Salerno, where the invasion was hampered by precipitate action - the fools rushed in when they should have dug in.  At Anzio the fools SHOULD have rushed in, but they dug in instead.  The fog of war being what it is, my sympathy is with the high command in this movie, but I guess that's beside the point.  ANZIO was made we questioned authority as a matter of course, especially military authority.
 The best war movies rush forward.  ANZIO meanders and makes some odd stops on its way to the battlefield.  Take, for instance, the strange scene of Peter Falk teaching the prostitutes to sing ""Bye, Bye, Blackbird.""  It takes way too long, it has nothing to do with the story proper, and it ambiguously establishes his character.  It looks like an ad-lib job and should never have been shot in the first place.
 A couple of the action scenes that take place behind the enemy line work pretty well, especially when the survivors come across the white dog and later when they encounter a snipers' nest.
 I'm a big fan of Robert Mitchum, and I think he's effective as the weary iconoclast.  Holliman and the other soldiers are okay in roles that don't demand a whole lot from them.  Falk's improvisational style is way out of place here.  The movie grinds to a halt every the camera centers on him.
 The ending, the liberation of Rome, is tacked on at the end.  The real end of the movie is the moment Mitchum discovers the answer to his question, ""Why do we fight and kill each other?""  The answer is pretty thin and unsatisfying, perfectly in keeping with the rest of the movie.",1081036800,21,3953,4.630215827338129
726055,4,6303686907,"Anzio is an uneven war movie that still manages to keep the viewer interested.  Starring Robert Mitchum as war correspondent Dick Ennis, Anzio tells the story of seven survivors of a botched mission behind enemy lines and their attempt to get back to the American beachhead.  There is a lot of anti-war sentiment here which in some places is a little unnecessary.  Ennis' whole point of staying in a combat situation is to find out why men fight, why there are wars.
 Anzio has an excellent supporting cast with Peter Falk as Corporal Rabinoff, a Special Forces guide, Arthur Kennedy, Robert Ryan, Earl Holliman, Reni Santoni(Poppi from Seinfeld), and Mark Damon.  The movie is entertaining although it is slow-moving in some parts.  There are only a few action scenes, but they are all done pretty well, especially the skirmish between the survivors and a group of German snipers.  One bizarre scene with Peter Falk singing Bye, Bye Blackbird with three prostitutes.
 The widescreen presentation of the movie is much better than previously seen.  The DVD offers four trailers including The Guns of Navarone, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Lawrence of Arabia.  Multiple options for spoken languages.  Good purchase although much more could have been done with the DVD.",1045440000,6,1271,5.004761904761905

7854753,1,6303686907,"This might not be the worst war movie ever made, but it's sure not far from it.  It goes wrong right from the beginning with the theme music being sung by Jack Jones.  The music and words sound like a bad Las Vegas stage show.  Before the invasion of Anzio, the troops are engaged in a brawl with each other in an Italian Villa or maybe a hotel for no apparent reason.  Peter Falk, who I normally enjoy, spends much of the time trying to teach women how to sing Bye-bye Blackbird. Again, for no apparent reason.  On the whole, the movie seems to have no strong storyline.  The movie was produced by Dino De Laurentiis, who has had hits and failures in his career.  This was not one of his shining moments.  I'll probably give my copy of the movie away to some thrift store where they'll sell it for a buck.  Probably a fair price.",1524528000,,830,4.235668789808917
