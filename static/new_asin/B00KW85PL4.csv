6452199,4,B00KW85PL4,"Unbeatable value. Great series. Gently's assistant is a bit of a nutter, but George Gently is very good. A different and very good mystery series",1410048000,,145,4.84
6452200,4,B00KW85PL4,"I love George Gently and so I was excited to get this bundle package.  I would have given it 5 stars but, I noticed that series 6 seemed to more cheaply made (ie, description of episode, etc) and I had to turn up the volume significantly for this series.",1409788800,,254,4.183673469387755
6452201,5,B00KW85PL4,Really liked having the season packaged in the same box as the rest of the order.,1409702400,,81,4.125
6452202,5,B00KW85PL4,"Well written, acted, and scripted.  Great scenery too!",1408924800,,54,5.75
6452203,5,B00KW85PL4,"Do you already own any George Gently seasons? This is a bundle package of previously released sets, a great savings for the new buyer of this series. But if you own some, you might want to look at another listing to avoid duplication. I already own all of them and this is a considerable savings over the cost when I obtained each one individually at original release time. The bundle is over 28 hours of viewing in 19 episodes. A bargain, but bloody and gritty.

George Gently is a fearless London crime fighter cop who moves to Northumberland (NE England) after his wife is murdered. George Gently Series episodes are based on selections of the 46 Gently novels by Alan Hunter. Episodes are feature-length, and can serve as stand alone stories. No need to watch them back-to-back in a hurry. A good 1960s period crime show, excellent plot writing. Acclaimed BBC hit.

All season/episodes come with SDH SUBTITLE option
Season 1: This first 2007 series shows the beginning, when Commander Gently's wife is killed right before his eyes. Even through his grief, the cop takes the high road in finding criminals and bringing them to justice. The 3 episodes in this series are very much like ""Midsomer Murders"".
- - - 2: Four feature-length episodes, each 89 minutes, & each serve as great stand-alone crime mystery films tied together only by a 1964 date. Gently has not given up fighting crime of all sorts and is now Chief Inspector in the extremely beautiful north countryside.
- - - 3: Gently, played by Martin Shaw, is through, calm, and plays the mentor/father to his youthful assistant, Detective Sargent John Bacchus (Lee Ingleby). Their relationship is as important to the story/series as the crimes and investigations. Both are performance perfect. Bacchus provides some laughs. 2 episodes.
- - - 4: PC Taylor (Simon Hubbard) is also back for both episodes. An emotional crime series, mystery, suspenseful, fast moving, and packed with plot. A perfect personality bounce between DCI Gently and Sgt Bacchus, with comedy spice. See individual series listings for George Gently on Amazon for my reviews having individual episode details, but not spoilers.
- - - 5: 4 more stories in this 2012 5th series, each near 1  hours. Gently is tough, and the crime is gritty, and this is best kept to adult viewing, at least responsible teens and up.
- - - 6: This series of 4 long feature episodes: 1 Gently Between Lines; 2 Blue for Bluebird; 3 Gently Going Under; 4 Gently from the Cold, has raised the bar again. It competes in quality to `Midsomer Murder', especially with the two-generational leading characters.

6452207,5,B00KW85PL4,"This series is a bit different from the ones we are used to (Midsomers, New Tricks, Morse, Inspector Lewis, Etc.) but is unique in its own right. We based our purchase on a 5 sec snippet from the advert at the beginning of all acorn media DVDs. After the first episode, we really got into it. It takes place in the late 60's in the area around Northumberland England. The series follows Inspector George Gently, played by Martin Shaw, arriving from the London's Met Police Dept (where he dealt with police corruption and ineptitude), and his unique ""honest"" approach to solving crimes. He battles local prejudices and his own internal demons. His Sargent, DS John Bacchus, played by Lee Inglesby, has his own inner demons and foibles, and their interaction is just part of the fun. My wife and I (Big British Mystery Fans) thoroughly enjoyed this series, and were very grateful that it was available in this less expensive ""collection"". We are waiting for series seven to start filming and for the DVDs to eventually come out..",1412380800,,1027,4.775280898876405

8662143,4,B00KW85PL4,"For the most part, I've really enjoyed these episodes.  It's set in the 60's and they do a great job with the clothes, the hair styles, etc.  The sound track was a little lacking, mostly with 60's-like songs, apparently created for the series. If you remember that era, much of it will make you smile.  (I had some Beatle boots, just like Sergeant Bacchus').  The dynamics between the two cops works extremely well.  The young kid really needs an older mentor, often to explain the difference between right and wrong. Lee Ingleby does a fantastic job developing this character.  The series is also tasteful, without gratuitous sex or gore. The only real downside is that many of the episodes were spoiled by being overly preachy about the wrongs done to women, Muslims, Blacks, etc. Gays are depicted as highly persecuted. Even though that's all historically true, the PC message sometimes got in the way of the story.  But if you can get past that, it's really a fine series.",1413936000,,976,4.739644970414201
