8173443,5,B000MX7TWC,My daughter watches this and all of the other Thingamakid dvds that we got over and over. She loves them!,1344988800,,105,4.3
8173444,5,B000MX7TWC,"We have had this Giggle Toons DVD/CD set for about 4 months.  They STILL want to watch it EVERY day!  It can be annoying(especially to my husband), but the DVD had very colorful cartoons and fun songs to go along with them.  Whenever we have other kids over, they ask to watch it too!  It comes in handy if I have something I really need to get done and the kids won't settle down.  Pop that in and they are sitting for at least 15 minutes of it, sometimes the whole time(maybe 25 minutes, not sure how long it lasts).  My daughter is 4 and she loves to sing along and my 2 year old son babbles and points at the cartoons with excitement!  You must get this.  It quickly became a favorite in this home!",1199664000,2,702,4.110294117647059
