8370807,2,B002ID098K,"This is a real stinker that is mis-titled to boot: It should be called ""Hollwood Saps & Suckers.""  Leave aside that all the films are grainy black and white without subtitles, many with chunks missing where the reel had decayed and needed to be repaired, and that most of them are to be found on other better collections from Amazon (which I already had).  These are not tough guys, but suckers who fell for dames, and most of the films are badly written, have terribly contrived plots, and are filled with rotten acting (though with some good performances).

They Made Me a Criminal: Garfield plays a boxer framed for a mob murder who flees to California, takes a new identity, falls for a dame, and decided to turn himself in.

Borderline: Fred MacMurray and Claire Trevor play undercover officers from different agencies assigned to investigate the same drug-running business who each think the other is a criminal but fall in love and have a romance even while each plans to arrest and convict the other.  Real believable, you betcha.

Shock: Vincent Price plays a conscience-striken psychiatrist who falls for a femme fatale (Lynn Bari) who impulsively kills his wife (with a candlestick, on a balcony) because she threatens to ruin his reputation only to have to treat the woman who witnesses the murder and instead of identifying him to the cops falls into a state of shock and becomes his patient.  Price struggles with the solutions that the evil Bari urges upon him.  Also real believable, you betcha.

The Man Who Cheated Himself:  Tough-boiled cop Lee J. Cobb falls for a fickle society dame (Jane Wyatt) who murders her husband so they can be together and then in a gesture of nobility takes the rap so she can be with another man.  Oh, yeah, makes perfect sense to me.

The Second Woman:  Robert Young plays a brilliant architect whose fianc dies in a a fiery car crash just before their marriage and thereafter everything he cares for dies or is destroyed.  He is labelled a paranoiac by his boss, his doctor and all around him except the loyal Betsy Drake (who loves him) even though he has not a suspicious thought about anyone and dismisses or minimizes the deaths until Betsy Drake (and eventually himself) solves the case.

The Great Flamarion:  Eric von Stroheim plays a rigid martinet vaudeville  sharpshooter, with a married couple as assisant-targets, seduced by Mary Beth Huges who wants him to shoot and kill her drunken possessive husband (Dan Duryea) so she can run off with another man.  von Stoheim's act includes real bullets smashing around the stage, sometimes directed at the audience, but no-one is hurt.  Again, very believable, as is the story told almost entirely in flashback from the point of view of von Stroheims' character who would be unable to know over half the things he ""remembers"" after he is shot and lays dying.",1473033600,,2862,4.7922606924643585

8370812,5,B002ID098K,"These guys are as tough as they come. A diverse group of actors shining in 5 very different film noir settings. The man who ""ran all the way,"" John Garfield in They Made Me A Criminal. The great pairing of Fred MacMurray and Claire Trevor in Borderline, which blends comedy and tension noir drama beautifully. Lee J. Cobb directed by Felix E. Feist in The Man Who Cheated Himself. Long-time film and television favorite, Robert Young, in The Second Woman ... did he kill the first woman? Will he kill the second woman? Brilliant director Anthony Mann, who noir catalog is every bit as impressive as his westerns, directs silent film director Erich Von Stroheim in The Great Flamarion. Five Stars.",1443398400,6,696,4.760330578512397
