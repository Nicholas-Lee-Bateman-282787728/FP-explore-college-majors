Buck Owens sings ""Love's Gonna Live Here"" in this episode. A succession of cast-members stroll into Archie Campbell's doctor's office saying ""Doc, it hurts when I do this"" to which Archie hollers ""WELL, DON'T DO THAT!!!"" and he slaps them with a chicken...and then a Hee-Haw Honey walks in and says ""Doc, it hurts when I do this"" and after looking, Archie looks and pauses and says: ""Do that again!"". hahaha

Roy Clark plays a bluesy guitar solo with a line of dancing pigs.

There are bloopers abound on this episode. Roy and Junior in the Kornfield battling over a word ""diabolic cunning"" in which Junior pronounces it as ""diabetic..."". In another Junior blooper...

""Will you teach me some baseball talk??"" Junior asks Yankee's baseball player, Bobby Murcer, which kicks off a series of bloopers as both Junior and Bobby try to get through the conversation. They insert the blooper throughout the show. Bobby had a 17 year baseball career...I looked him up and he had 252 home runs and 1,043 RBI's during his career.

Riddle and Phelps do their manic ""Eeef and Eyeff"" routine...they each play the same guitar at the SAME TIME. Roger Miller sings ""Dang Me"" with the Hee-Haw gang and later sings ""That's The Way I Feel"". He does a scat-singing skit of sorts with Riddle and Phelps where things get a little violent near the end with the hand slaps.

A secondary music guest is a Texas singer named Peggy Little who sings ""I Wish I Didn't Have To Miss You"" and ""Statue of a Fool"".

Don Harron as Charlie Farqueson is the customer in Archie's barbershop and the two of them exchange pun's and play on similar sounding words in their comical exchange.

Charlie's KORN newscast is the most hilarious skit...second to this is The Culhane's. In this episode everyone's missing and Archie playing a cop asks Junior questions of where the rest of the family could be. The Hager Twins sing ""Teach Your Children Well"", a pop hit for Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The Nashville Edition perform ""Break My Mind"", a hit for George Hamilton, IV. Buck sings ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"".

The Laugh-In influence was pretty much evident in this episode and others during the very early run, 1969-1974, and then it moved beyond the manic lightning quick editing which appears in this episode into a more relaxed editing style. Roger Miller makes a cameo in the ""Pickin' and Grinnin"" segment...which only features Roy and Buck and no cast-members. This episode only featured Roger Miller and Peggy Little as guest singers and baseball player Bobby Murcer. As I mentioned in other reviews, the lack of a large guest line-up meant more comedy sketches and one-liners.

This was the show's 45th episode...still airing on CBS at that time...airing on January 12, 1971 but the episode was originally slated for November 3, 1970, I suppose, because at the end of the episode the announcer tells everyone the guests for the next week's show: Tom T Hall and Jean Sheppard. Those two appeared on the November 10, 1970 episode, not the January 19, 1971 show. In the episode list I have, there isn't a November 3, 1970 air-date, which I find odd...so this January 12, 1971 show was really meant for November 3, 1970 but wasn't aired for whatever reason.

Loretta Lynn and Bill Anderson appear in the second episode on this two episode DVD. Loretta sings ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and ""Secret Love"" while Bill performs his hit songs ""I Love You Drops"" and ""Wild Weekend"".

Roy and Junior do a blooper around the word ""concussion"" in the Kornfield. Buck sings ""Roll Out the Red Carpet"" with the cast. This episode originally aired on February 2, 1971.",1240272000,3,3633,4.80448717948718
