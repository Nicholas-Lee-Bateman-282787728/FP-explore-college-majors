7882544,3,6305074097,"Sure it's not professionally done,but it is entertaining. For somewhat comedy and maybe I'm a bit bias because of knowing some of these folks in it. Besides look at some of these other hood movies that been made since then?? Big Ballers is a decent watch that may have you laughing on some of the acting. For the good or bad.",1470441600,,325,4.344262295081967
7882545,5,6305074097,You have to be a fool to take this movie seriously. This movie should be viewed as a comedy not for what it is. It is sooooo bad it is comical and  should be enjoyed by you and your friends in your living room while your are drunk or blitzed. The best part is when Kash looks into the camera when he is not supposed to I was in tears laughing. Or the beginning where he they were talking about taking over the tears of laughter were flowing. This movie is SOOOOO BAD its a MIAMI CLASSIC,1439510400,2,486,4.010309278350515
7882546,3,6305074097,I can only say that the best thing about this low budget video movie was the contribution of George Cotayo for his very good work as director of photography. The acting was very poor accept for the one who plays Cash. I like the music soundtrack.,1075939200,,246,4.369565217391305
7882547,5,6305074097,"There is no other way to describe this movie other than EPIC!!!!  Please tell me this is where the trilogy begins.  As soon as my friend showed me the back of the box at my local video store, i knew it was a hit!  In fact, it was so much of a hit that i did not hesitate to spend 3$ for it to own when i saw it on the used shelf 1 month later.  My only complaint is...""where is the dvd?!""  I gess it sold out everywhere.  Also, where is ""rags to riches to rags to riches""???, the ""comedy"" that was advertised at the begining of this ""drama"".  Seriously, i think this movie is a must see for anyone who needs a laugh.  Basically anyone who is reading this has already seen this movie and is jus lookin fo rmore ways to laugh at it. ""Cant get enuff big ballers anonymous"" is wat we all need.",1073260800,,789,3.949367088607595
7882548,1,6305074097,"This movie is pure garbage. The photography is comical and the acting is an example of how one should not act. This is as corny as they come. On the box it says ""BANNED IN THEATHERS"",I now know why..'cause they'll be a riot and a gang of patrons demanding thier money back for such a display of pure undiluted trash ever filmed. One actor (wanna-be),says ""Know what Um saying"", so many times it'll make you sick when you hear someone else say it.""Big BAll of Trash"" should be the title to this chopped up corny crack addicts with a video camera trying to portray themselves as real street thugs doing things in Florida. This can be used to show film students how not to make a movie. And I'm sure there will be many topics to talk about, such as poor sound, empty dialog ...don't rent nor buy this GarBall-age...this is trash and the best thing about it is the box it came in...the art work and the write up on the box leads you to believe that you are purchasing something worth your time and money...if you want to get back at someone ..tell em that this was a good movie and convince them to buy it or rent it...you'll be laughing for days...thanks for reading my review. ...",975801600,4,1178,4.359090909090909
7882549,1,6305074097,"This movie has got to be the dumbest, most ignorant piece of junk I have ever seen!  If I could, I would rate this 0 stars.  There was no point to the movie, the filming was wack, the acting was poor, and the script was  probably made up as they went along.  I hope someone did not take out the  time to write a script like this.  One guy apparently had one line to say  during the entire film and that was: ""Know what I'm saying man.""  No I did not know what he was saying.  Please do not buy this movie!",959990400,2,505,3.872549019607843
7882550,5,6305074097,THIS IS THE REALIST HOOD MOVIE I HAVE SEEN THE CAMERA WORKS ARE THE BEST THIS IS BETTER THAN ALL OF NOLIMIT FILMS PUT TOGETHER MUCH MUCH PROPS TO BIG BALLERS RECORDS AND FILMS SOME ADVISE DON'T RENT THE MOVIE BUY IT,956102400,,215,4.142857142857143
7882551,1,6305074097,"I would rather have been kicked in the head.... You should count the times one of those guys in the movie says ""Know what I'm sayin'"", or ""Look here"" damn.. someone should have killed this guy before  they made the movie it would have saved 2 hours of my life I cant get back",955756800,,275,4.092592592592593
7882552,2,6305074097,"This movie was really bad. The photography was terrible, the dialogue (when you could understand it) was moronic and uninspired, and the acting...well it's hard to find an adjective that truly captures how bad  the acting was.  The words ""take two"" obviously never found their  way onto the set.  The first half hour was ok for a couple of laughs (at  how bad and goofy it was), but it was all downhill from there.  There isn't  a student filmmaker alive that couldn't put this movie to shame.  I thought  the box was cool though (hence the two stars instead of one).  It had  better lines on it than the ones in the film.  So unless you love the box  as I do, go buy something good like Scarface.  Now that's a movie about a  big baller.",952905600,2,738,4.323529411764706
7882553,5,6305074097,"This movie shows the realities of young black youth that live the ""thug life"".  Also, it gave a perspective of a black woman that was involved in a relationship with a ""high roller"".  You never  see these aspects of the street life in a movie and at least BIG BALLER  made an good effort to show that the street life is not all GLAMOUR and  LIGHTS.  Thumbs UP Playa!",940809600,,366,4.231884057971015
