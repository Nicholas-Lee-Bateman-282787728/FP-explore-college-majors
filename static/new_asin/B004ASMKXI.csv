8420818,5,B004ASMKXI,"What a great privelage it is for us who know and love Danny's drumming, to see and hear this close and personal DVD. No one else was able to fuse jazz and rock together like Danny did in Chicago. His drumming was just as important as Chicago's horns. This video takes you to a California Transit Authority stage where Danny shows you his current chops and explains his style and licks to us.
The only negative has nothing to do with Danny. His guitarist is great but I wish he would change his tone from metal fusion sound to a jazz rock tone. I think it would work better for Danny's style and musical selections.",1412640000,,614,4.3478260869565215
8420819,5,B004ASMKXI,"If you are a fan of Danny Seraphine and Chicago (before they went soft, predictable and boring) you will enjoy this documentary about a musically adventuresome band.",1402272000,,165,5.148148148148148
8420820,2,B004ASMKXI,"If you a big Danny fan and you want to hear the story of his life then you will love this. If you want some lessons, come away with a few new licks etc this is not for you. NOT AND INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO.",1365638400,2,201,3.697674418604651
8420821,5,B004ASMKXI,Great insight into the world of jazz rock drumming from the master. Mr Serephine gives a great description and demo of what it takes to make the music feel great.,1358294400,2,162,4.433333333333334
8420822,5,B004ASMKXI,A MUST HAVE if you're a fan of Dan!  This isn't a purely instructional DVD (although it does have ample instruction); it spends a lot of time following Danny around his old haunts and walking down memory lane.  It's well produced and Danny's down-to-earth personality really shines.,1331596800,5,282,4.9787234042553195
8420823,5,B004ASMKXI,"Danny shows you how to play his style of drumming with things like Introduction,I'm a man and a few things from California Transit Authority. Danny also shows you the house Chicago live in when they first move from Chicago to L.A.It's also a 2 disc DVD as well. If you're a fan of Danny you should get this DVD.Nice supplement to go along with Danny's book Street Player",1297209600,6,370,4.455882352941177
