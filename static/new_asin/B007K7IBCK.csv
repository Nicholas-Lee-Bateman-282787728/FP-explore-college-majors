Whether you're a soccer fan or not, you can't help but be moved and inspired by this film. It's message speaks to young people to dream big -- REALLY BIG -- and never doubt yourself. It's a reminder to those who have put their dreams on hold to pursue other things to not forget where they've set those dreams down. This is a film to have in your collection and watch over and over.",1336435200,2,547,4.121495327102804
5092636,5,B007K7IBCK,This is a fantastic film that tells an even better story. Soccer fans will love it and other people will appreciate the journey.,1336435200,2,128,4.608695652173913
5092637,5,B007K7IBCK,"I was lucky enough to see this film in theaters - and was blown away.  The story touches on so many different emotions, it's hard to not be moved by Jay DeMerit's tenacity.  The story of Jay's rise from the soccer fields of Green Bay, Wisconsin to the biggest stage on Earth, at the World Cup was incredible.  The movie itself was beautifully directed.  This is a must watch not just for soccer fans, but for all sports fans, and those looking for inspiration in life.",1336435200,2,468,4.406976744186046
5092638,5,B007K7IBCK,"Jay DeMerit worked hard, didn't whine or blame other people, and it paid off big time. He is the 21st century American hero that should serve as an inspiration to young people everywhere. It seems we've come at a crossroads in this country where more people than ever are comfortable with not taking responsibility for themselves, and as a result never realize their full potential. Jay DeMerit squeezed every ounce of potential out of his body, and his accomplishments speak for themselves.",1368403200,,491,5.0
5092639,4,B007K7IBCK,"Great motivational Flick, especially cool for any US Soccer fan. Its a great movie to have in the movie library.",1358294400,,112,4.65
5092640,5,B007K7IBCK,I'm shocked this story hasn't been told more often.  Someone should make it into a movie.  Well worth the price.,1355788800,,112,4.55
5092641,5,B007K7IBCK,"Wonderfully directed, and the acting was top-notch for a documentary.  There were tremendous montages of Green Bay, London, and in particular South Africa, that really set the scene for an emotional world cup.
As a newspaper journalist, I am used to seeing sensational stories of success and this was a story that was truly top-notch.
Godspeed Jay, may the winds of your dreams take you to new and exciting heights... I can't wait to see the next chapter",1353888000,,454,4.82051282051282
5092642,5,B007K7IBCK,"Have you ever had a dream? Have you ever been driven to follow your heart when nearly everyone around you is telling you to give up? I'm 14 years old and I was living that last year. When you're constantly being told why something is impossible it is so easy to just give up. Jay DeMerit didn't give up instead he went all the way and beyond. He did what he was told was unreachable and he succeeded in the most amazing way. This movie follows his journey from a young youth player like myself to the 2010 World Cup. Its not just a soccer or football movie. Its a movie about overcoming the toughest of obstacles and making a dream become a reality. Anyone who needs inspiration to follow their dreams will find it in Rise & Shine.

The funny thing about Rise & Shine is that Jay's story is now a part one. Part two is the story behind the movie production. The team that came together to film the story and the fans that joined in to fund the dvd all have their own mini stories to tell now. Through Rise & Shine I found a support system that keeps me believing that I too can make my dreams come true. Thank you Jay for all you've done to grow the game and for giving youth players like myself a little easier road to travel.",1337558400,,1227,4.15546218487395
5092643,5,B007K7IBCK,"Rise & Shine is undoubtably one of the greatest films I have seen. It chronicles the unlikely path American Soccer Player, Jay Demerit took from zero to hero. Jay is essentially a REAL life Rocky Balboa.

The film is about soccer, but you don't have to be a soccer fan to enjoy this movie. It is family friendly, and truly is a GREAT film for anybody! Makes a great gift!
This film is perfect for anybody who needs inspiration to follow their dreams!",1336694400,2,450,4.421686746987952

5092645,5,B007K7IBCK,"This soccer documentary will inspire not only soccer fans, sports fans, but every American to reach for the stars. Work hard, stay focused and you can achieve.

5092647,5,B007K7IBCK,"Rise and Shine is an indie documentary that shows what it's like to make a career out of soccer as an unheralded young American. Yet the film transcends the facts to focus on Jay DeMerit's story of incredible mental strength to go from the depths of the English pyramid to the top top level of the game.

I saw it in a theatre and ended up getting the DVD as well. If you, a friend, or family member are a fan of US Soccer or American soccer, this is a film of super quality and fantastic character with an outstanding attitude!",1336521600,,528,4.227722772277228

5092649,5,B007K7IBCK,"This movie is about a dream and what can be accomplished through perseverance.  When you finish watching this movie pay attention to the credits and the thanks.  The financing for this movie was made possible not by some deep pockets investment bank, but by 1937 individual soccer fans, MLS supporters, and folks from around the world who knew of Jay and were inspired by his story. 105 of these backers pledged between $250 and $10,000 and are thanked in the credits.

This story exemplifies what can be accomplished through perseverance, hard work, and belief in oneself.",1336521600,,573,4.947916666666667
5092650,5,B007K7IBCK,"A documentary for all occasions, not just soccer fans. I got chills throughout the whole movie, I was left in awe of just how Jay is just another one of the guys. He still is so humble and grateful about everything that has happened to him. From Watford's winner to the 2010 World cup, he never changed who he was.",1336521600,,314,4.25
5092651,5,B007K7IBCK,"Rise and Shine is an awesome inspirational movie to anyone, not future soccer players.  It will tug at your heart to see the dedication Jay put towards making his soccer career be the best it could be.",1336521600,2,201,4.4324324324324325
5092652,5,B007K7IBCK,"Great movie! Saw it in the theater and bought the DVD. I would recommend it not only for soccer players, but anyone that's ever overcome diversity to prevail in the best way possible!

Two thumbs up!",1336521600,,199,4.527777777777778
5092653,5,B007K7IBCK,This documentary of Jay Demerit really puts an impact on the viewer and sends a clear message of how chasing your dreams in life is what everyone should do. I would recommend this for any person and all ages. It is truly inspiring and will make you want to chase your dreams even further.,1336521600,,288,4.351851851851852
5092654,5,B007K7IBCK,"You don't have to be a soccer fan to come away from this movie with the mind set that you could accomplish all of your goals in life!  This movie single-handedly makes you believe not only in yourself, but in the American dream by definition!  For years the perception was that Americans know nothing about soccer as it pertains to the rest of the world; however all assumptions are thrown out thanks to this TRUE tale of a person that never gave up on their dream.  Jay DeMerit seized every ounce of chance thrown his way to eventually start in all 4 of the United States World Cup games.  This is an arena where only a handful of players over history can say they entered.  The directors and cinematographer do an amazing job of bringing the story together (and were not given enough credit by the mainstream media) on an extremely limited budget to deliver an inspiring message.  Buy this movie and tell a friend because the message needs to be spread, especially in todays ever changing times!",1336435200,6,997,4.573033707865169

5092656,5,B007K7IBCK,"Being a huge soccer fan I saw this in the theater with my husband and knew within the first 5 mins I would have to have this on DVD. The story of Jay is inspiring and the documentary itself is shot nicely and the story flows, you never lose interest. I love all the candid interviews and how you get a sense of the area and culture in England (even if you have never been). Amazing movie and a great family watch. Jay is quite the role model.",1336435200,4,442,4.034090909090909
5092657,5,B007K7IBCK,This movie represents everything a young futbol player wants coming from the USA. We all have the passion for the game but the culture holds us back. In this movie you will see what happens and what it takes to make it in the worlds biggest league and with the best futbol players in the world! Highly recommend! I use this in the school classes and the kids love it they are all soccer players!,1336435200,2,395,4.28

8518805,5,B007K7IBCK,"...Well, not quite.  That is, it wasn't so easy for the American Rocky Balboa of soccer, in the US or in England.
Jay Demerit's story...
There are setbacks, rejections both in the US and in England, a tiny bit of luck, and great stories of barely getting by to follow his dream.  There were several key people along the way whose support allowed Jay to focus on his dream and away from the naysayers and distractions, starting with his English soccer playing friend in the US who asked Jay to live at his house in England while they both attempted to break into English professional soccer.  Jay goes from small but enthusiastic Green Bay Wisconsin, to a similar small but enthusiastic Watford England, and it seems he simply wouldn't have succeeded or had his constant ""fearlessness"", without very select affection he found in both places.  Interviewing some beer drinking young men in a pub in Green Bay, as one of them mocks how soccer players run, it becomes apparent Jay not only suffered from not having a training infrastructure but also a social infrastructure for soccer in the USA, and prejudice against any sport that didn't involve the Green Bay Packers.  Jay's problems compound in the UK, where a soccer talent scout estimates Jay's largest hurdle to breaking in will be that he is American.  It seems like it's Jay against the world, except for a few key English and American people who believe in Jay's dream.  Jay got lucky again with the club that gives him his first big contract, because it seems the tight friendship and family that allowed him to succeed is exemplified in the fans that populate Watford's seats, as Jay notices the men walking with their sons to every game, not having the English hooligan aspect of other clubs.  One gets the impression that Jay's financial and professional success is matched or exceeded by his friendships and family.  It's a touching story of how his English friends(almost second family actually) believed in him (and housed him for three years!) while he suffered his struggle from playing for free(or almost free) in the English Sunday morning ""pub league"", to facing off with the titans of professional soccer in the World Cup and England's toughest league.  It's a story that simply isn't duplicated much if ever in England, with an orderly system fostering players from preteenage.  Jay describes how the meals at his house would vary depending on how much his English friend's mother would bring home in tips.  Jay would contribute only 20pounds a week.  I especially like how he described hopping turnstiles to save a few dollars, scrounging for food(beans on toast), being so happy and feeling rich to get a 20pound raise(50% increase in salary, yes he went from 40pounds to 60 each match but only after threatening to leave).  He progressed, however, and eventually he scored one of the few goals(an amazing head shot) for his team in a match that made his soccer club almost $100million and allowed them to enter the English Premiere League, considered the toughest league in the World.  Demerit spent a respectable 6 years at Watford, ""watching players come and go"", and now plays professionally in Major League Soccer for Vancouver.

I'm especially glad that the heartbreak of professional sports is touched on here, with the coaches describing how the players are brought into the system at the age of 8 or 10 years old and can be out in a flash due to injury or simply lack of performance or focus one year.  Since everyone in the world plays soccer, the competition for slots on pro soccer teams is like no other sport, so it should be noted the exceptional athletes who try and don't succeed at soccer.
This is a must see documentary.  Just see it.  I almost don't want to say it's on Netflix.  This isn't an extremely slick documentary and I could see this redone as a great dramatic film, but it still comes off as an amazing story.  The documentary maybe should've gone more into Jay's home life in England.

One has to wonder if another documentary featuring all of the Americans who somehow were able to play at the top levels in Europe should be done.  Sure Jay Demerit succeeded, but his story shared difficulties that many American soccer players suffer - being caught between both the American and English societies, neither of which foster American soccer players very well.  In the end it became a close knit group of English friends, American family and believers(including trainers), and seemingly most of all Jay's natural tenacity, that allowed him to achieve his dream.",1372377600,,4562,4.819230769230769
8518806,5,B007K7IBCK,This is a great documentory and has the complete story of how he became a soccer player in england and then for the USA national team. I would recommend this for any soccer fan.  I show this to my teams that I coach to show the hard work required to reach your goals.,1369526400,,267,4.037735849056604
