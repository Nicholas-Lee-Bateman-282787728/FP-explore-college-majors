837688,1,6304291361,I bought the video and was sorry.  It was so unrelated to the other two that it was almost unrecognizable. I didn't like the bratty kids and the whole story line was unpleasant to me. The only plus for this is that I now  have a set of 3.,946857600,8,238,3.836734693877551
837689,1,6304291361,"After seeing this movie, I said...""why?"" I personally think that the incredible debut should have been laid to rest...nothing like it will ever be made again. There are some movies that are so incredible that  should be left alone, and Neverending Story was one of these. Yes, even  though it's named ""Neverending.""
Instead of accurately  continuing with such a great story and making sequels that follow the 80's  culture and movie making style, they decided to make this doorstop. (Which  is pretty much all it's good for).",946339200,6,525,4.988505747126437
837690,3,6304291361,"Fantasia has changed within the past few years. In my opinion, I say, buy the original and the second one, and to complete the set, buy the third. Most people should agree when i say, the original is the best. ",946080000,2,210,4.25
837691,1,6304291361,"The Neverending Story is one of the best fantasy movies of all time. There are few movies that inspire people throughout a lifetime. Since childhood,  I have been in love with the Neverending Story. However, Neverending Story  III did no justice to it's incredible predecesor. What a shame. It's not a  fantasy movie, but rather a ""made for Disney"" kids flick.",940982400,10,360,4.868852459016393

837749,1,6304291361,"This was an INSULT to NES fans,i agree with most of the reviews, i have never been able to see this movie past the first 20 minutes, they should have just shelved this production, i guess just because they cast J.J.R. as main cast fans would be OK with it, don't bother with this movie.",1461542400,,286,4.218181818181818
837750,1,6304291361,"this movie has no ties to the orginal or the book, it's nothing more than a cash grab at a good book.  Anyone who's read the book can tell you the first movie is the closest to the book, the second takes elements from the second half of the book, but this is a horrid movie. Read the book and watch the first too movies. This movie doesn't and shouldn't exist to any Neverending Story fan.",1458172800,2,389,4.118421052631579
837751,5,6304291361,"I cant believe they made this movie. Actually, I don't think made is appropriate in this case. It suggests volition and the idea that this was intentional is unfathomable to me. I mean, you don't make a poop. Of course, saying that they took a huge, steaming Never Ending Story III doesnt sound right either. Regardless, this film is epically bad. That is, it is so bad that it is still not good, but somewhat better than awful to the extent that it leaves you with an uncomfortable, confusing, yet weirdly exciting experience somewhat akin to having malaria whilst getting brutally beaten up by a really attractive super model. I think this analogy could work on multiple levels because this movie is exceptionally shallow to boot. My cousin is an English major and he tried to analyze this film in an attempt to find the underlying themes. They found him under his house in his underpants a week later with a sandwich bag full of matches and a rubber cobra that hed named Fred. My aunt is still paying off the home equity loan that she had to take out to pay for his therapy. Now all he does is sit around in Incredible Hulk underroos watching Care Bear cartoons all day whilst eating gold fish crackers out of an old cowboy hat.

If you are lactose intolerant, this film may not be for you. It is excessively cheesy. I missed about 10 minutes of it because I was frantically trying to move our expensive wool rug out from in front of the TV because there was grade-A American cheddar oozing out of the speakers! In fact, forget lactose intolerance. If you have a pulse, you should probably steer clear of Never Ending Story III. It is the only thing in existence that is known to have made Chuck Norris cry. It was a single tear, but still!

So I laughed out loud just now as I considered the sheer absurdity of the concept of spoilers for this movie. Nevertheless, they do say that anything is possible so you may want to stop reading because I may be about to spoil this movie for you even more. Imagine that! [SPOILER?] So here we go. In Never Ending Story III, the rock-biter has a baby. Not as in gives-birth-to, but as in has his/her kid with him/her (I don't want to enter into conjecture regarding the sex (gender?) of the rock-biter.) At any rate, there is a scene wherein the rock-biter is crunching along on his/her rock-scooter (a la Flintstone bike) with his/her kid riding in the basket and the two are singing Born To Be Wild At least that is what I think they were singing. It was hard to hear over the sound of my own screaming and sobbing before I passed out. When I woke up, my wife was kicking me and begging me to go change my pants.

I don't know if it is a survival mechanism or what, but my brain didn't allow me to retain coherent memories of this film. I can only recall fragments of it and even these are abstractions. I keep having flashbacks of the rock-biter baby who, I think, played a semi-major role. Im fairly sure that they hired a teletubby for this role and paid for some speech therapy. It could say intelligible words that sounded good, but it couldn't really convey any meaningful thought; kind of like an Obama speech. And then there was Jack Black. I promise he was in this movie (IMDB confirms.) I remember thinking how he was like Houdini or something. The fact that he could escape from this film to go on to become a star is a testament to his talent as an actor. And his performance in Never Ending Story III was great; standing in stark contrast to the performances of the rest of the cast I assume. I don't really remember or want to for that matter.

And the title is confusing. I think there is a paradox buried in there somewhere, but I don't want to expend the effort to perform the necessary analysis. Clearly, each of the movies in the trilogy have an ending, at least for the audience. But naming the sequels ordinally is misleading and can be misinterpreted as suggesting that the previous never-ending stories did, in fact, end. My daughter actually managed to deduce this and she cried for days just like she did when she figured out that Santa wasn't real. On a related note: not many people know this, but the title is, in actuality, intended to suggest that the film is finite. The Never Ending Story III was originally titled The Movie That Never Ends. However, several viewers committed suicide during the pre-screening. Eyewitnesses reported that the victims panicked when they believed that the film was not going to end. The legal department at Miramax insisted that the film be titled Never Ending Story III in order to mitigate liability. Im kidding, of course sort of. Im sure that probably didn't happen.

I could go on about this film all day, but it is nearly sunset. At night I don't like to think about Never Ending Story III or I end up sleeping with my head under the covers, which can be really unpleasant when the wife has gas. In summary, this is a must-watch film for anyone who likes root canals or the smell of raw sewage. Seriously, youll laugh so hard til it hurts so good! Once the initial PTSD subsides, youll look back on it Thats all Im saying.",1450137600,4,5136,4.465388711395101

837932,1,6304291361,but 3 was a total loss.  There was no continuity with the premise of the original stories.  Established characters were unrecognizable and new characters were forced into the story with a cinematic crowbar.

The first 2 movies are exactly what they are supposed to be and then this laughable 3rd one shows up... I absolutely LOVE Jim Henson and his creations, but the follow up Never Ending Story III is way too far from the originals. They changed Falcor up and made him really creepy looking. All of the acting is horrible, especially Junior. It's actually annoying and ridiculous. They story would have been really awesome if the the whole movie was just trashed and redone. What is cool about it? Jack Black is in it and the kid from Free Willie, but seriously... That is the only cool thing about it. The puppets are fantastic, don't get me wrong, but if you are looking for a continuation on your favorite childhood movie... Forget it.

The Story is pretty awful and the characters are annoying and cliched. If you think never-ending Story 2 is bad you haven't seen this one. This movie also looks cheaper than the first movie. Mind you the first movie was made in the 80s and it looks better than this tripe. You'd think a newer film would have better effects. Watch it for free don't buy it.,1392163200,,704,4.64

838106,2,6304291361,"Neverending Story 3 did not seem to hold true to the premise of The Neverending Story. I consider it a major mistake to take the story into the human realm instead of leaving it totally in Fantasia as was done in 1 and 2.  The plot is supposed to be a fantasy storyline instigated by Bastian's imagination. A child's fantasy cannot change or control what happens in his/her real world, as it did in Neverending Story 3. Although the ending was nice, it is not logical that a child's fantasy can change people as it did with members of the gang.  And it is not likely that the human realm would be able to control what happens in the fantasy world, except in a child's imagination.

Also, Bastian's dad did not seem to have a clue about Fantasia and the book. This broke the consistency in the trilogy in that his dad was definitely a part of Story 2.

In my mind, the story was essentially a tale of a boy moving to a new school, adjusting to a melded family, and dealing with bullies at school. It is not a story line that I would choose to watch. I was hoping that the story would evolve to concentrating more on Fantasia, but it was minorly about Fantasia.

Basically, mixing Bastian's fantasy/imaginary world with the real world and taking characters out of Fantasia and placing them in the real world did not work for me. Sorry.",1364774400,3,1333,4.402439024390244

I liked all three movies.
They are all different,all original and all radical.
They all tell a story and the third one is honest about bullies.

If you wanted different then you should ask two people something.
The casting director and the actor as well one question:Why did y'all not have each movie similar?

Otherwise try to enjoy the full movie series

One thing I noticed was the whole film seemed like cartoon characters were invading earth, only even Roger Rabbit was more compelling to watch, I give this two stars for having real human characters (Nicole and Rachael) being thrown into his story to give it a twist, THIS seemed like real life in a way, for some reason...but they should have worked on giving it the same old-fashioned sense of dignity and grandfather-like wisdom!

This has nothing to do with the original books.  However, I have to give the credit to the screen play to try to make it something educating for the new family formed by the previously divorced family.  Children are hurting from their past experience and the void of the last parent is hard to make up for.  The story move more out of fantasia to the human world and Holloween theme fell into it nicely. I think the director is trying to tell people not to be so nasty toward each other.  This is very good because the next generation kid's attitude toward us senior are very rude.  I wish the film could be more fun like the original Never Ending Story.

Instead of a tale survived by a boy and his Father.. ( which each movie somehow has  a new different boy and a different parent..)..THIS one is about a boy and his Mother..

I wanted the complete set but I definately could have lived w/out this version. SAD ..very SAD..the Fantasia characters throw one liners out like they know all about the Human World and the innocent sweet princess is a joke as well.

I had read the negative reviews on here, and thought, could it really be that bad, or are reviewers just giving it the same treatment they did Part 2 because it has a few minor differences that can be overlooked with relative ease.
Well, I'm afraid I have to fall in with the majority of reviewers in my opinions.  I found a copy at my local library where I checked it out for free, and MAN did it blow!  There was yet another kid playing Bastian, who apparently got tired of the dye job and is back to brunette.  Again kid's tastes change on a near daily basis at that age, so that much can be easily overlooked.  But then we get to the story.

838359,3,6304291361,"I remember watching ""The NeverEnding Story III"" in the cinema as a kid. It was probably the first time I ever felt disappointed in a piece of entertainment. The sets and effects were all of the same standard as the first two, yeah, but everything else was a bit of a mess. I hoped it would be a little better, watching it on DVD. It ended up being just as messy, actually.

Bastian (Jason James Richter in this film) has moved to a new school, and he's finding it hard to fit in, having trouble with a group of bullies called the Nasties (their leader played by a younger Jack Black). Bastian's also finding it hard to fit into his new family. His father has remarried, and Bastian now has a cynical step sister and a nervous new stepmother. Still, there's a familiar face at the school library, the antique bookseller from the first two films: Mr Koreander. He has brought the books from his store too, placing them on the library shelves. Among these is the NeverEnding Story, which Bastian takes once more, wishing himself into the pages. Now abandoned, the bullies take hold of the book, and by their reading of it, begin to reshape not only the world of Fantasia, but the real world too (as it's part of Bastian's story). Will Bastian be able to save both worlds from this nastiness?

It starts off promising enough, sweeping fantasy landscapes during the title sequence, but that all quickly gives way to a lot of cheesiness. Rockbiter has a wife in hair curlers, watches a TV in Fantasia, and gets to sing ""Born to Be Wild"". His son Junior now has a ridiculous voice, as does Falcor the Luck Dragon, who has gone from being a noble, encouraging creature to being accident prone and reluctant to face danger. The Childlike Empress, usually such a pure character, wishes that she should go clothes shopping, while the two Gnomes spend most of the movie looking for a toilet. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times too. Regarding Bastian, Engywook (a Fantasia Gnome) says ""He's no Arnold Schwartznegger in the muscle department"". If he's a fantasy character, how does he know about action movies? Barky, the tree man, also spouts a lot of cheesy cultural references, probably more than anyone else. These is a lot of very 1990s pop music in the background, which by itself wouldn't be so bad, but in the midst of all the mess seems to heighten the cheesiness.

I was disappointed as a kid with this film, yeah, but now I kind of watch it in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. I was laughing so hard watching the scenes with Junior Rockbiter and Falcor, just at their voices, the dialogue, and the silliness of the scene they were in. It would be hard to purposely make a film this so far from the first two films and the original book. Even though it is ridiculous, it's still pretty engaging too. I certainly wasn't bored watching the film. I was a lot of other things, but I definitely wasn't bored.

Though I prefer the first two films (the first most of all), this one is worth a look, just to see how unusual it turned out. It definitely makes for something to talk about.",1161907200,12,3079,4.483065953654189
838360,1,6304291361,"It looked like it might have had some promise from the start, and the kid who played Bastian had a nice, subtle, uniquely malevolent humorous way about him when in the presence of people who were really asking for it, and the head 'nasty' seemed a delightful villain, but then well-established things were toyed with in the wrong ways. When I saw the second movie in the theater when I was 11 years old, I was very disappointed to say the least (after just having read the book by Michael Ende), so I can't say I had high hopes watching the third one at the age of 26, but what I did have was quickly crushed. I had to give it a shot because the plot of the book has only barely begun when the first movie ends, so I was curious to see if it did a better job of continuing the book than the second movie. But it was in fact as much beneath the second as the second was beneath the first and having even less to do with the book, in a comparison like a planet to a tennis ball to an atom. Simply put, it was an insult on the original and to the book. No longer is there the dark, serious atmosphere to Fantasia (Fantastica in the book) of the first movie, the land of myths, legends, heroes and monsters, with hidden surprises and amusing novelties, but now (I don't know how better to describe it) it is a place that doesn't take itself seriously. It was no longer a world on its own, it was a forgery. A footnote to the 'real' world, with moronic consequences. MM Power Rangers sort of moronic. Yeah, that moronic. But it was when the characters established in the first movie came out that it just went so wrong. I was more than a little dismayed when the miserly Engywook suddenly had been changed in a couple noticible and detrimental ways, but I could tolerate no more when they introduced Falkor, the luck dragon. They totally ruined the character. I couldn't stand to watch any more. I was so disgusted I decided to go out of my way to put it in a review to warn people about this insult of a movie, and here you are, reading it. Not only was Alan Oppenheimer, perhaps better known as the voice of Cringer (and Battlecat), Skeletor and Man-at-Arms from the infamous He-Man cartoon, no longer the voice and replaced with something that wasn't even close and totally wrong in every way, but he was all dopey, clumsy and dumb as a sack of doorknobs instead of suave, charismatic and mysterious as he ought to have been. And much more cartoonish in appearance, too. They could have at least used the original model from the first movie. Shame on you, Jim Henson's creature factory. For shame. You shouldn't so thoroughly mess with something like that. Bare minimum, any pros or cons of the rest of the movie aside, it should be a given that you should preserve something so sacred as best as you can, and you could have done about a million notches better than that.",1153785600,11,2869,4.344506517690875

You always need to go out there and do what you believe, and whether you think so or not, there are people that are counting on you!

The plot has Bastian returning to Fantasia to escape ""The Nasties"", which is some sort of gang. The Fantasia in this movie is very different from the one in the first two. It looks a lot less inviting, and they really screwed up all the beauty that Fantasia possessed in the first two movies.

Second and third series tried to get things right only in vain. Fantasia is a creation of human mind so when we changes the story changes that is what neverending story is. Auryn is as second series nicely put it, not a magic stick. Third series is no exception. Bastian's new sister used Auryn to buy what she wanted then the side effect was their newly-wed parents are in danger of divorce. This story's not a fantasy story at all. It is more real than you imagine. It is too bad a time to make neverending story movie at all during dark 90s. Maybe this time will be more acceptable to have another series.
