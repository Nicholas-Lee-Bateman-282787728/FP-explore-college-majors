Aesthetic wise Mia Wasikowska was great for playing Madame Bovary. I just don't feel that this was her one her better films. I could not feel the emotional connection between the actors and actress. It also felt like they were reciting memorized lines. The ending was also very abrupt.

I have read the book, and of course I would recommend reading that above anything else. The best thing is to see the movie and decide  if it was worth it. I highly doubt I would watch it again.",1434153600,12,611,4.545454545454546

7155530,4,B00X3DC702,"I refuse to stand inert beneath this torrent of despair. Is not your visit a trifle inopportune? This is an absolute reproach. The writers of those lines, who do not seem to know the meaning of the word reproach, should if there were any justice have their writing hands operated on by Charbovari. Yet the irony is that one of the worst screenplays I have had to suffer through since Cecil B. DeMille hung up his megaphone is the basis of a quite good motion picture. It is not Flaubert, but that is not a basis for complaint. Im sure there were Chaucer purists who abhorred Shakespeares version of the Cressida legend when it first hit the boards simply because it was so different from its putative source. Madame Bovary is weak where it is weak not because of what it isnt; it is weak because of what it is. Phrases like a moshing together of Ibsen and Barbara Cartland run through my mind but to tar the movie in that way would be unjust. I did at first fear that Nora would get out of her dolls house just to find herself ripping her blouse with the best of them, but Emmas downward spiral, which bears only the most superficial resemblance to Flaubert, is a tale well told, superbly paced and exquisitely directed in both the montage and the handling of the actors. The art direction and costuming create a visual feast and the overall feeling of pathetic rural tragedy imposes itself in a genuinely satisfying way.

But pathetic tragedy is not tragedy and it is decidedly not Flaubert. The fault is partly that of the film around whose celluloid neck is hung the hideous weight of dialogue that seems to have been written in a Dunkin Donuts somewhere in the vicinity of West Covina. But the novel Madame Bovary itself is equally to blame in a manner of speaking for that work evokes in an almost pure form the famous Flaubertian sense of idiocy and futility - that unpleasantly sour taste in the back of the mouth at the very idea of living  and elicits it in the medium of minimal and disengaged verbal beauty. Flaubert raises disenchantment to very nearly metaphysical levels and one would have to be as great an artist to recreate the Flaubertian world. The safer bet is turn it into just another tragedy  which is what Sophie Barthes did and did very well indeed. It is unfortunate that the script which she had a hand in writing should have endlessly betrayed the luscious visuals and the actors who had the thankless task of mouthing the words. So far was this from missing le mot juste, things would have been much better if there were no mots at all. The English actors did their best the give the appearance of actual diction to what they had to say and having Paul Giamatti retain his American accent added clever color to the otherwise curiously abbreviated satirical portrait of the progressivist go-getter Homais (His profession as a pharmacist was completely eliminated). And I did like the fact that the Abb Bournisien was depicted as an even bigger nitwit in the movie than in the novel.

But then theres Mia Wasikowska. Poor Mia Wasikowska. Shes not only very attractive with the delicate sort of facial features Im a sucker for, she also gave a performance that is most certainly better than very good. As long as she kept her mouth shut. Her reaction shots were wonderful and her pantomime of Emmas increasingly frantic desperation was well worth the price of admission. Her final confrontation with the sinister colporteur appositely named LHeureux was from an acting standpoint the best scene in the picture. But someone has to take the blame for the way she spoke her lines. The girl is Australian so she must have had a dialogue coach; so why in heavens name give her a bland suburban American accent when the rest of the company was largely Royal Shakespeare or the equivalent? She sounded like Malibu Upon Avon. In addition her pronunciation of the French names was so bad one must suspect there was some sort of strange joke involved: Mon-shur Oh-May, Mon-shur La-Bay, Mon-shur Low-Row. Maybe she learned her French from her father, the only actor in the film who affected a French accent in a way that made him sound more like Pepe Le Pew than anyone recognizably Gallic.

There is a sense in which Madame Bovary (unlike Salammb which, given modern techniques in video and cinematic computer graphics would make a splendid adult-themed sand and sandal epic) cannot be translated to the film (and certainly not to the stage) and this has to do with the very essential modernist quality of the novel. I assume Im not the only one who has this feeling, but when I read Madame Bovary I feel I can picture and imagine plausibly the thoughts and motives behind the action every one of the characters (even the hapless Charles, a bumbling paillasse who was reduced to a bland nonentity by the actor who played him). I can see and understand every one of the characters, that is, except Emma Bovary. I cannot see her. I have difficulty imagining what she looks like (though Wasikowska was a good if somewhat glamorous approximation), and, despite long analyses and the fact that the book spends most of its time following her around, I don't feel at all comfortably familiar with what she is thinking and feeling. In an important sense she is a cipher, action and reaction without articulate consciousness. The actual motives and introspection are provided from a distant third person perspective that is the narration (very different from the internal monologue devised by Zola and developed into the sort of stream of consciousness which is usually thought to be the hallmark of modernist literature). This is strange, even uncanny. Something of an accounting may lie in Flauberts much quoted exclamation, Madame Bovary, cest moi. Flaubert did not just mean that he was exposing to the world his own foibles and romantic delusions, a sally of the boring sort that only psychoanalysts can listen to. Rather Emma is invisible because the character and the standpoint or consciousness (though I hate to use that term) of the narrator/author merge. We cannot see Madame Bovary and do not understand her because in writing or reading her story we are Madame Bovary and she did not visualize or understand herself. This may sound a bit contorted and all I can do is imperfectly suggest what I think, but it is, I think, what cuts the links with the Balzacs, Dickenss and Hugos of the world and creates at a blow a new world in narrative literature.

By way of envoi let me express the profound wish that Barthes not even contemplate filming Flauberts masterpiece, Lducation sentimentale. If she does I will personally visit the set and cut off a lock of La Wasikowskas hair.",1468368000,,6696,4.713919726729292

7155532,1,B00X3DC702,"Very disappointing.

The story was quite rewritten for the movie script and the whole character of Emma turns out to be fake. She is depicted here in a way that does not match her real personality in the book. She is capricious and ungrateful, and a liar about what she says she ""suffers from"" from her husband.

Same thing for Charles by the way, who is depicted here as a perfect husband and a brilliant doctor. In the book, things are way more subtle and complicated. Charles is a a nice man but a complete loser and physically kind of repugnant. She did try to love him. He disappointed her in more than one way. And if she can be a bit frivolous, her aspirations can definitely be seen as legitimate. I mean try to imagine you were standing in her shoes and we'll see if you won't dream of a better, more joyful and sexier life.

As I don't understand why they merged the two characters of the Marquis d'Andervilliers and Rodolphe, her first lover. They are two different people in the book, and Rodolphe is no aristocrat.

I definitely enjoyed more the BBC two part Madame Bovary, with France's O'connor. Though it's not perfect, it sticks more to the book.

And btw, Emma is supposed to be a ravishing dark black haired beauty. The actress chosen here is almost red haired and has no flamboyant beauty as Emma does.",1467763200,,1322,4.468879668049793

7155550,3,B00X3DC702,"Im not sure how many previous films and television productions have been adopted from Gustave Flauberts acclaimed novel, but here comes yet another.  This time helmed by a lady, Sophie Barthes (Cold Souls), in her second feature film.

Set in the mid-19th century, Emma (Mia Wasikowska, Crimson Peak) is kicked out of a nunnery where she was placed by her father.  She just wasn't cut out for it.  She quickly marries a young country doctor, Charles Bovary (Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Anna Karenina) in order to escape her fathers pig farm.  Dr. Bovary isn't very ambitious, seemingly happy with his life in the local village tending to various ailments by the letting of blood.  Hes also pretty quick in the sack.  Slam bam, thank you mame would seem to be his motto.  Emma wants more.  She pushes her husband to be creative with his medicine.  She wants to move to the city.  And she wants passion in her love making.

Nave in what is expected of her, she goes into great debt thanks to the local merchant, Monsieur Lheureux (Rhys Ifans, The Amazing Spider-Man) who pushes clothing, household items and jewelry toward her.  Bored with her life of getting dressed and sitting around, she strikes up a couple relationships with friends of her husband.  Both miscast, Ezra Miller (Trainwreck) plays Leon Dupuis and Logan Marshall-Green (Prometheus) plays the Marquis.  In the Marquis, in particular, Emma finds what shes looking for in the romance department.  He knows what hes doing but even so, Emma isn't afraid to take charge.  Perhaps thanks to Ms. Barthes more realistic take on female sexuality.  But the Marquis is quickly turned off by Emmas insistence that love is in the air.

Eventually Emma must come to grips with her marital infidelities and Lheureuxs debt collection efforts.  Barthes pacing could be improved, but the film is beautiful to look at.  Wasikowskas Emma isn't quite convincing but is also dealing with a lumbering script at times.  If you like these Euro-costume dramas you might want to give it a look.

The Blu ray package comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  It features beautiful images with crisp detail and nicely grained.  The picture looks good, whether gazing over rolling farm land or extreme close ups.  Black levels aren't as deep as I would like but that may be on purpose.  Colors and hues are excellent with a nice contrast between the colorful garb and the mud-washed village streets.  Audio comes from a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless track.  The film is dialog heavy, so little is going on in the surrounds but for the musical score and some environmental effects.  Still it is solid throughout and dialog is easily understood.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH.  There are a handful of trailers as the only extras.",1452470400,,2786,4.861702127659575

Though I have nothing against Mia Wasikowksa, I do not underdstsnd this trend of casting her in the lead role of these adaptations of classic novels. Like it did in her version of Jane Eyre, the casting once again missed the mark. The energy and underlying passion and restlessness of the character were not present. Leon was even worse. Aside from looking like a 16 year old, the young man simply couldn't act. It was highly unbelievable that Emma Bovary would fall for this particular Leon.

7155555,2,B00X3DC702,"I regret that I cannot agree with Neuromancer in the description of the quality of acting in this film. Most of the acting to me, did seem wooden and the lines felt like blandly spoken rehearsed lines which lacked expression. Then I found the lack of English accent in both Ms. Wasikowska and the first love interest to be distracting.  The poor diction they displayed did not keep me in the period even while I tried repeatedly to ignore it. It was too close to ""California talk."" Ms. Wasikowska, is beautiful  in her own way and has the ability to look both plain and stressed out as well as elegant. I did agree with another reviewer that her acting improved for the last 25-30 % of the film. The costumes and scenery were beautiful but the acting and staging lacked dynamism and lacked anything memorable. I think the ""married couple"" should have worked on their presentation much more. They seemed to have chosen to act in such a way as to depict through lacking, that there was no connection. This is depleting to watch and uninspiring. There should have been more effort given to this area of the film. I would say there must be something more Ms. W could have done. Perhaps if she had portrayed a more passionate, agitated type of boredom/frustration it would have sold me. I can't imagine being an addict of this movie. I think that those who have read the book which I have not, must know something I don't. Also the sudden change of Ms. W overnight to show her spending money was not believable. To me the acting needs more emotionally expressive direction and nuance.",1448755200,3,1579,4.575971731448763

7155557,5,B00X3DC702,"The first time I encountered Gustav Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"" was in a college lit class.  I must have been eighteen or nineteen and my instructor's impassioned account of the doomed Emma Bovary fell on deaf ears.  What do you expect from a kid with shoulder length hair and a face full of pimples who up to that point hadn't had a meaningful relationship with a member of the opposite sex who wasn't a blood relative?  Now that I've bore the slings and arrows of life somewhat thirty-some years on I get where my teacher was coming from.  I'll try my best to make this more of a critique and not a class assignment.  For starters director-scenarist Sophie Barthes nails it.  About the only artistic choice I would question would be beginning the film with Emma's ultimate fate and then recounting her downfall in flashback.  That does not diminish Flaubert's observation that Emma was doomed by the lack of life choices French society offered her and the retribution that would smote her for going against the norm that was prescribed for married women.  Mia Wasikowska is a revelation as Emma in subtly suggesting her character's internal changes.  We may not agree with her choices but because of Wasikowska's nuanced performance we are consistently empathetic of Emma.  The other compelling character of the piece is the venomous merchant played by Rhys Ifans who is the snake in the Garden of Eden personified dangling fineries in front of Emma that have as much to do with her downfall than her sexual indiscretions.  The publication of ""Madame Bovary"" was quite the scandal in France in its time.  Some 160 years later there's a certain prescience to the work almost as though Flaubert was anticipating the feminist movement.  I don't know if that was Flaubert's intent but that gives us a little bit to chew on.",1448150400,2,1820,4.813504823151125

The costumes, the scenery and even the boring quietness of the country village were staged wonderfully for a seasoned lead actress in the role of the extravagant Madame Bovary to bring them all to life.  Instead, we're given a one-dimensional, unconvincing performance of a naive child unwilling or unable to grow into the manipulative woman that the role calls for.

What makes this classic story so appealing is the utter boldness of a once respectable married woman, who learns through adulterous dealings with worldly men, to seize her desire for love and material beauty without care for the consequences it may bring to her husband's love, reputation and finances. It's a dramatic story there for the taking if played right.  Either the director pitched the character wrong or the actress playing the role just couldn't get it right. Kudos to the supporting cast for giving her pitches to hit out of the ballpark; unfortunately for fans of this classic, the lead strikes out looking. Badly!

""Please God, let him be the one""; daughter Emma (Mia Wasikowska) pleads aloud in front of her mirror concerned about her impending nuptials to Dr. Charles Bovary (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), a well-respected small-town doctor within his community of Yonville which this story is set. This is based on the quite scandalous, at the time, eighteen-fifty-six novel by Gustave Flaubert. Co-written for the screen by Felipe Marino along with Sophie Barthes set in provincial France who also takes the director's chair and I felt brought out the emotions and feelings of such a woman as Emma whose passions burned brightly for love and reckless enthusiasm for living while trying to avoid its repercussions. This is not fulfilled with Dr. Charles Bovary. Emma believes he is a man married to his work leaving her lonely.

Barthes brings to the role a pull toward the convictions of Emma's upbringing in a convent of which she was not always able to conform to. Learning the basics of the day which consisted of etiquette, walking, drawing along with musical interests among other amenities, all in the highest hopes of acquiring a substantial marriage partner. Emma was sent to pass her time only reading about the interests and concerns of the world. The dismal and moody shots of this woman trapped within a shadowy and gloom-filled life which is held back by a conformity she really desires to break free of; those chains consuming her are well represented. She spends much time alone with the intoxicating idea of romance which fills the novels of which are mentioned, but only to a small degree. Spending so much time idle during her days, the cinematography (Andrij Parekh) mirrors the bleakness of her life along with strikingly dark scenery and the gorgeous period costumes. Her servant maid and confidante discuss her dismay and disapproval even to the point of Emma breaking down with despair because of her excruciating state of understanding that she is just going through the motions; only existing. The first third of the film is more darkly shot to show the dull and uninviting life of which she believes she is imprisoned within.

Charles is a decent man although leaves her to her own devices, mainly boredom and loneliness, day in and day out while spending his free time consulting with his tax accountant and friend, Monsieur Homais (Paul Giamatti). She is soon introduced at the first blush of her marriage, to the town's seller of fine goods as he persuades her to exercise the taking out of credit as the 'Lady of the house' to which ""Charles is good for it"". Does she, though, turn from his unwavering flattery about her beauty, exquisite eye for detail, and impeccable taste, along with his own sales tactics? Lheureux (Rhys Ifans) is quick to enter the picture as he drapes her in the finest of fabrics from all over the world, just for a look, along with dresses woven with gold threading, another thought of what she should be appearing in; silver pieces, expensive beautiful home items with the income of her husband's profession. To place beauty all around Emma may show her that all the loveliness of life has not escaped her and still remains within her grasp.

Emma has met many of Charles's friends soon after their marriage. One she has taken a specific interest in as he is a romantic just as she, a fellow dreamer, Leon Dupuis (Ezra Miller) who is now a tenant of Charles' friend Monsieur Homais. Another dashing man who quickly turns her head at a stag hunt of powerful importance is the Marquis (Logan Marshall-Green). Of both of these men, the Marquis, and younger Leon, Emma has taken an alluring interest in as they are able to captivate her while taking her away from the monotonous and excruciatingly uneventful life she is just trying to avoid. All the while, Emma is building a large resentment toward Charles for not being desirous of wishing for her all she would wish for herself.

Because of being scandalous in its day, which is interesting now, no more should be explained or the story (especially if you are not already versed in this delectable piece of literature) may be spoiled for you. In particular, this movie surely takes off after about one-third of the way into this after necessary character building which does involve impeccable scenery, subtle movements, and beautifully spoken wording. Sophie Barthes takes this in slightly different directions and I found Mia Wasikowska did an exquisite and desperate portrayal of our protagonist, Madame Bovary. Portraying such a lucrative literary figure is a difficult, to entirely consuming portrayal which can hopefully please everyone in possibly different avenues. As for me, I definitely do enjoy more than not a beautifully done period piece and Mia Wasikowska is surely growing as a diversified actress with each picture I view her in. This particular movie concerning Emma Bovary was a purely interesting watch for me, if different from what I have viewed before. The movie begins. Then takes its time with the ability to care emotionally for our lead character, Madame Emma Bovary who is the focus. At least for me, this piece completely paid off while marching to its own unique beat and stayed in step with my own reaching imagination.

7155607,3,B00X3DC702,"Yet again we have an incarnation of Flauberts novel of infidelity and this time the transformation of the book to screen (by Felipe Marino and director Sophie Barthes) is, at best, weak. The pacing of the film is adagio and the cast is adequate if unremarkable. The only standout in the film is the costumer and the strange but adequately atmospheric music by Evgueni and Sacha Galperine.

For those who have forgotten the story, In mid-1800s Normandy, France, farmer's daughter Emma (Mia Wasikowska) leaves the convent where she was educated and marries a young doctor, Charles Bovary (Henry Lloyd-Hughes). With high hopes for a fulfilling and romantic future like the ones she reads about in novels, Emma leaves her childhood home and loving father, moving to the small town of Yonville where Charles has based his practice. While Charles loves his new wife, he is consumed by his work and is out of the house all day visiting patients. During their brief daily time together, Emma is bored and repulsed by his talk of ailments and dull business affairs, and Charles is all but oblivious to her ennui. With no regular company besides their maid, Henriette (Laura Carmichael), Emma becomes a vulnerable client to the crafty local merchant Lheureux (Rhys Ifans), who entices her with luxury goods available for purchase on credit. Emma soon befriends a young clerk, Leon Dupuis (Ezra Miller), who shares her romantic frame of mind and disdain for provincial Yonville. Emma longs to go to Paris and immerse herself in the culture, and has quickly tired of her dull existence as a country doctor's wife. Leon secretly confesses his love to Emma, who, despite the mutual attraction, dismisses his advances. Leon departs for law studies in Paris. Charles and Emma are invited to a hunting party by the Marquis d'Andervilliers (Logan Marshall-Green), who had dropped by Doctor Bovary's house to have one of his servants treated. The Marquis was immediately attracted to Emma, who becomes so excited about the excursion into high society that she orders expensive clothes from Lheureux for the occasion. At the party, she is entranced by the luxury of the upper-class and by the subtle advances of the Marquis, whom she meets once more at an agricultural show. Emma's thirst for extravagance only grows, and she begins to spend liberally to beautify the house and her wardrobe, all on credit from Lheureux. She also takes the advice of local pharmacist Homais (Paul Giamatti) and convinces her husband to operate on the club-foot of Homais' servant Hippolyte (Luke Tittensor) and become a celebrated surgeon. The surgery fails. Ashamed of her husband's incompetence and feeling all the more stifled, Emma visits the Marquis at his home and confesses her misery. They begin an affair, with Emma making regular trips on foot through the woods to visit him. Charles has no inkling of his wife's unhappiness in the marriage or of her affair. Emma eventually begs the Marquis to run away with her, and though he initially refuses, he calms her by promising to make arrangements to elope. And to tell the rest would be consider spoilers.

Mediocre at best this is a very long song that could have been so much better in so many ways. Grady Harp, August 15",1439683200,3,3243,4.937728937728938
7155608,3,B00X3DC702,"This is another disappointing  film version of Flaubert's great novel.  While no film can do justice to all the magnificent scenes imagined by Flaubert, this movie not only suppresses some of the most important, but wastes our time by adding scenes that are not in the original and which add nothing to the movie.  Mia Wasikowska is not the worst Madame Bovary but she is far from the best.  Her principal expression is a very deeply furrowed frown, and one finds it hard to imagine how this young woman could have attracted Rudolph and Leon.  The film concentrates on Emma's consumerism to the detriment of all the other themes of the novel, but this is the best part of this otherwise dull movie.  Rhys Ifans steals the show as the ironically named Lheureux, who tempts Emma into more and more debt.  Homais's role is inconsequential, which is a waste of Paul Giamatti's talent.  And what is bizarre is the mix of British and American accents among the characters (and Mia Wasikowska isn't even American). Surely as an Aussie she could have adopted a British accent to match that of Charles.  The best adaptations of Flaubert's novel are still the Fywell version, brilliantly acted by another Australian, Frances O'Connor, the quirky but satisfying ""Maya Memsaab"" a modern Indian version, the Portuguese ""Vale Abraao"" and ""Gemma Bovery"" (actually an adaptation of an adaptation, since it brings the riff on Madame Bovary by Posy Simmonds in her graphic novel to the screen).

It did not show wildly inaccurate aristocratic clothing or interior design, such as other adaptations have put forth. This looked like middle-class 19th-c provincial France.

However, the bad was pretty bad. The film was so terrible I couldn't even finish it. It was. as one can tell from the first scene, unfaithful -- as many others have said. But it was unfaithful not in trivial ways but in ways that violate the meaning of the book. It almost makes me wonder if the director read the book. The film suffers, in my opinion, from an obvious attempt to make Emma sympathetic. It shows the boredom of her life well, but by distilling her character to just this aspect of the poor bored housewife it makes the film less complex rather than more. Confoundedly, Emma is wan and meek while Charles is unthinking and insensitive. The novel is, of course, notoriously difficult to adapt. But, this version erases all of the nuances of character for which Flaubert is famous. I heard many good things about Mia Wasikowska and very much wanted to like her, but I found her absolutely unbelievable as Emma. Leon was laughably bad. Paul Giamatti's  M.

Set in 19th century France, the story tells of Emma Bovary (Mia Wasikowska), who agrees to an arranged marriage with a country doctor (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), then finds that she is bored with the provincial life.  Soon, in order to make her life bearable, she begins to buy an extravagant wardrobe and elegant household items on credit from a predatory local merchant (Rhys Ifans).  She also engages in clandestine romantic affairs with a nobleman, as well as a young law clerk.  Indeed, it is not long before her dalliances and spendthrift ways bring down both her and her kindly, if unexceptional, physician husband.

As directed by Sophie Barthes, MADAME BOVARY is a visual delight; a series of stunningly beautiful images that captures the romantic era in which the classic story is set.  The cast, which also includes Ezra Miller, Laura Carmichael, Logan Marshall-Green and Paul Giamatti, is well chosen and exceptional.

On the other hand, the handsome film is a bit long and could easily have lost fifteen or twenty minutes in order to pick up its pace.

So, what message does one take away from this timeless, ultimately tragic, tale?

Dont give your wife your credit cards!

I have never read this particular novel, so I watched the movie with an open mind, only expecting the dialogue, costumes, and props to be historically accurate.

I watched the preview before renting the movie. The preview gave the impression that this would be the lustful, romantic tale of a young bride who was bored and ignored by her cold husband. I quickly found myself changing from feeling sympathy for Madam Bovary to being angry with her immature and selfish attitude.

***** This review contains important plot details! *******SPOILER ALERT!!! *****
She goes from living in a convent to being married to a doctor from a small, country town. Life as his wife isn't what she dreamed of.  She wants the diversions and excitement of a larger city.  The affairs and excessive spending (Why didn't her sensible husband put a stop to that before her account reached $10,000 pounds?) are all her ways of acting out because she is dissatisfied with her quiet life as the wife of an honorable doctor. I found myself wondering why she simply didn't have a couple of kids to help her pass the hours of boredom.

Madam Bovary is naive in that she foolishly expects each of her lovers to whisk her away from her mundane life. I cringed each time she asked them to take her away from her boring life. I gasped when she asked her first lover to give her the money to pay off her debt. He just wasn't that into her. No sensible, unmarried gentlemen at that time would have given up the hope of an honorable match with a virtuous woman and settled for a life of seclusion or scrutiny with someone else's unfaithful wife.

There are a few factors that kept this from being a 1-star review. First, I genuinely appreciate the fact that director Sophie Barthes resisted the Period Piece Purgatory of slathering fake English accents onto the performances. There's nothing worse than a gaggle of Americans trying to sound more legit as a Brit, even when a movie is set in mid-19th century France, ancient Rome or revolutionary Russia. See directors? We get that this is an historic thing without everyone sounding like Sir John Gielgud. Take all of that linguistic affectation and trade it in for some actual creativity in your rendering. Yes?

A couple of performances worth noting are Rhys Ifans (legit Brit) as Monsieur Lheureux, the nasty shop keep/money lender and ultimate architect of Emma's fall. I was also intrigued by relative newcomer Ezra Miller as Leon. Miller has a kind of unicorn other-worldliness about him that plays well to the naive and shallow idealism of the character.

These are little silver threads in an otherwise wet wool blanket of a movie. I'm fine with big departures from the source material, provided you've found something new to say about the story. Joe Wright's recent send up of Anna Karenina is a nice example of taking huge creative license to good effect. It's jarring for purists, but Wright ultimately builds a unique view of these well-worn characters that's worth considering. Sadly, that's not the case here.

Madame Bovary is a journey through the romantic ideals of a sheltered childhood, the trappings of social convention, the disappointment in chronic mediocrity, and the ultimately gritty realities of life in a misogynistic culture. Instead of watching the trivial but deeply passionate Emma longing for her real life to begin, she seems to float listlessly from one situation to another with no idea what any of it means. I suppose that could be one person's interpretation of Emma's character, but it's not 2 hours' worth of interesting.

Of the more recent attempts, I definitely prefer Tim Fywell's version with Frances O'Connor as Emma. Fywell gives us more back story. He shows a bit more compassion for Emma and what's driving her bad choices. As a result, we're more invested in her panic as everything starts to fall apart. He also wisely kept Charles' mother in the story. While seemingly bitter cruel, she's an important force for reason. She also provides a great distraction from the real malevolence of Lheureux.

Generally, why bother turning classic pieces of literature into yet another movie version without having anything new to contribute? Please stop.",1434844800,4,2818,5.099783080260304

All I can say about this horrible film is that it is the WORST acted and LEAST true to the original story of those that came before it.  Wooden performances and choppy scripting force the amazing costuming and beautifully filmed scenes to become an abomination that should have been binned at the preview.  TO ALL MADAME BOVARY PURISTS:  Stay as far away from this as you can, UNLESS you, like I do, just enjoy keeping up with the film versions as they appear.

7155705,4,B00X3DC702,"The latest in a long line of adaptations of the seminal novel by Gustave Flaubert, French-born director Sophie Barthes' (Cold Souls) English-language Madame Bovary is a compact and often gorgeous rendering, though definitely more of a cerebral experience than a red-hot story of sensuality and tragedy.  In a rather curious misfire, Barthes opens her film at the end, with a poisoned Emma Bovary (Mia Wasikowska) racing through the forest, tightly clutching her side and then falling to the ground.  It is an overly literal and revelatory way to begin a film already defined by its air of inevitable despair and doom.  Then, however, an elegant and well-crafted depiction of tedious provincial life emerges, with several moments of genuine visual poetry, particularly ones contrasting Emma's increasing flamboyance with her pastoral environment and the way the disparity insulates and misguides her.

Barthes completely foregrounds the title heroine (anti-heroine?), excising the Flaubert novel's early shared focus on Charles (Henry Lloyd-Hughes), her doting, but unimaginative husband.  The film sprints behind her as she ends her authoritarian education at a convent, weds, and moves to live with her husband in an out-of-the-way hamlet very far from the Paris she dreams of.  Wasikowska, of whom I am an enormous fan, is dynamic in the lead role.  She exhibits sympathy for her character's plight, but is also unafraid to explore her sinister side:  tendencies toward greed, self-destruction, and vanity which emerge as she pursues an empty and unrealistic type of fulfillment.  (It is a bit of a shame this adaptation ignores the character of Berthe, Charles and Emma's daughter, denying the star the chance to play provocative scenes of domestic malaise further complicated by maternal discontent.)  The other performances are largely capable, though no one comes close to eclipsing Wasikowska.  Among the peripheral cast members, Rhys Ifans is best, stealing a few scenes as a slyly malevolent fashion merchant, Monsieur Lheureux, who praises and smiles as he spins inescapable webs of debt.",1434412800,21,2098,5.424615384615384

7155708,5,B00X3DC702,"Mia Wasikowska, in this new, atmospheric adaptation of ""Madame Bovary"" (a revolutionary classic), makes a fascinating, sensitive, and convincing Emma; one that resembles not so much previous Bovary's from previous films, but rather the complicated, twenty-something, anti-heroine of the novel (which I've long loved). Casting an uncanny spell, the young actress captures much of the conflicted ambiguity of Emma, and manages to create empathy while making so many foolish, self-destructive choices. I've watched the film twice, and by the second viewing I got past the differences from the book (I know all the dialogue and scenes), the gradual pace, and was absorbed by the melancholy stillness that builds, in stages, to the soul's unraveling. I haven't felt any movie has captured the book (which may be an impossible feat), but this one is subtle and affecting; it has it's own poetic perspective, mystique and beauty (without the novel's ironic detachment), and Mia's portrayal has the enigmatic, haunting qualities that have made me a Bovary addict.

Scenes of Emma running ornately clad through cow pastures vividly show her stranger-in-a-strange-land status (a peacock surrounded by peasantry). There were many references to her conflicted relationship to nature (reality), including the hunt with the Marquis, that I felt were effective, showing her, after the killing of the stag, instinctively seeking power and station equal to men. Emma asserted herself through her sexuality (adulterous affairs), and conspicuous consumption; not surprisingly, this didn't work out too well. I think that in both the book and this film, Emma is seeking some measure of power, and, of course, love, but in a reckless, unconscious way. The final, climactic scene was stark and poignant; it felt real to me. This version of ""Madame Bovary"" (as seen through Emma's eyes) is a haunting tone poem, with a sad, blue-tinged beauty of its own.

The cinematography, costumes, and production design are gasp-inducing gorgeous (reflecting Flaubert's aesthetic bliss), but they're more than eye-candy, they are integrally connected to the emotional journey of Emma, and rapturously convey, in delicate detail, the dreamer's eternal longing for a distant ideal.",1434153600,54,2244,5.482658959537572

8714780,4,B00X3DC702,"I haven't read the book but according to most reviews, it appears the movie stays true to it. I do wonder if that made for the 1 dimensional characters throughout this film. First, Mia Wasikowska only grabbed me during the last 1/4 of the movie, when things start to crumble.
With the restrained dialogue, we don't really have a feel for any of these characters, with the exception of Rhys Ifans who appeals to her vanity to get her to make purchases. Madame Bovary is a sad figure of a woman, who appears to have been raised well by a loving father and educated by nuns but who immediately begins to disdain her husband, a village doctor, and her surroundings. She has a nice enough home and a servant but she quickly starts to pine for more luxurious fashions and decor. Likewise, in her restlessness, she ends up having affairs with a young man who is a student and another who is an aristocrat. Meanwhile her spending debts are adding up and her husband doesn't seem to recognize it until its too late. As reality sets in, M. Bovary seeks out her lovers, past and present to help her and to care for her in the depth of her distress, but she is basically cast away. Her recklessness was beyond the pale. Only after some momentary awareness, she makes her way into a church where the rector asks if she is there for prayer or counsel. He appears not really interested in helping her, perhaps because he like many others in the village suspect of her of being immoral, and suggests she take a walk in nature. I believe this is the final straw of ""rejection"" that she could bear. Her husband who has loved and cared for her sets out with some villagers to look for her.",1508544000,,1670,4.425324675324675

8714784,1,B00X3DC702,"DO NOT PAY TO WATCH THIS MOVIE! (I'm sorry I did. Here's why:)
Scenery and costumes were gorgeous. That's the best thing I can say.
Unfortunately they didn't match the class level of the lead characters.
But that's not the worst error. The directors completely missed the major themes of the book and lost the story line completely.
Even if they named this movie Madame Dovary and didn't want to make it anything like the book, the characterization was one-dimensional, there was no sense of the characters' motivations, and the movie just jumped from one event to the next - no flow. I wanted it to go faster just so I could get it over with and Emma would die - not the startling way she did in the book of course - and also, that's not a spoiler because she basically dies in the first 60 seconds of the film so you already know how it's going to end - nice. At least in the book it comes as a surprise.
One more thing... The mismatched accents were preposterous, and Mia Wasikowska sounded like an American teenager acting in a high school play about ""olden times"". It was really terrible. At no time was I not aware that these were a bunch of actors trying to make a movie. What a shame.",1497657600,2,1192,4.349775784753363
