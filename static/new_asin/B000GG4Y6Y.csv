if you have not seen these seasons  then I recommend you do",1413504000,,2937,4.1282952548330405
8131834,5,B000GG4Y6Y,I'm very glad I purchased the complete package.  It's great to view again & again.,1268352000,,82,4.466666666666667
8131835,4,B000GG4Y6Y,"The Charmed Ones helped show what women, especially witches, can do. The original Power of Three included Prudence, Piper, and Phoebe. Shannen Doherty (Prudence) left and a new sister was discovered named Paige. They held down jobs, owned a nightclub, and had children all while battling warlocks, demons, and other forces of evil. The show ran for eight glorious seasons.",1168646400,,372,5.216666666666667
8131836,5,B000GG4Y6Y,"I'm a Charmed fan and I hate to say this but buying the Charmed Pack seson 1-6 for $274.99 is totally NOT worth it. WHY? Because if you buy each season 1-6 seperately, total will cost $210.80 (savings of $64.19). And if you add season 7, it will be a total of $243.28. That's still a big savings! So I suggest that you put each season one-by-one in your shopping cart if you want to save money. You save $31.71 if you buy season 1-7 and add it in your cart one-by-one.",1163030400,51,468,4.0978260869565215
