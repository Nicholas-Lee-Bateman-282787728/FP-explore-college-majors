3919297,4,B002EQA0X0,This shows what good comedy entertainment can be without having to be off color or use foul language what a pleasure to watch,1396396800,2,125,4.478260869565218
3919298,2,B002EQA0X0,Past shows and not what I was looking for.  Wanted to see life story and not show.  If want past shows would be good I think.,1384646400,,125,3.769230769230769
3919299,3,B002EQA0X0,It was ok. The picture quality was a little disappointing but I guess that was just the best for early television. The show  was entertaining (if you're into vintage TV). A lot of big names appeared.,1383782400,,199,4.527777777777778
3919300,2,B002EQA0X0,The picture quality kept me from viewing the entire show. I saw Danny Thomas in person in 1970 at Harrah's  Lake Tahoe.,1378166400,,119,4.409090909090909
3919301,2,B002EQA0X0,Love Danny Thomas but this was not one of his best. Have seen more of this shows and they are great.,1366761600,,100,3.8095238095238093
3919302,3,B002EQA0X0,"Not much Lebanon, I enoyed thos TV show as i loved Danny Thomas . I t is black and White but the video production is not good. If you like Bing Crosby and or danny thomas . You will still enjoy this.",1357430400,,199,3.761904761904762
3919303,4,B002EQA0X0,"How can you ""spoof"" a Road Show?  Watch this video and see.  Our family enjoys watching the Road Shows...in spite of stereotypical portrayals of other cultures...remember, these were made in the '50s and '60s.",1327536000,,209,5.117647058823529
3919304,1,B002EQA0X0,poor quality video. Has nothing to do with the title.,1441324800,,53,4.4
3919305,1,B002EQA0X0,"Great premise with Bing Crosby as guest,but unfortunately it is such terrible quality it is hard to watch.  Wish we had a better version.",1439856000,,137,4.708333333333333
3919306,1,B002EQA0X0,"Very poor copy I bought by mistake.  Video is muddy and low resolution.  Bleh!  Danny looks so much better on Cozi-TV and that's standard definition (over the air with an antenna, not through cable)!",1438214400,,199,4.794117647058823
3919307,3,B002EQA0X0,"Old and cheap made movie. But beautiful, even though it gives a somewhat wrong idea about Dany's ancestral land.",1433116800,,112,4.947368421052632

3919310,3,B002EQA0X0,"Pretty lame story,  I guess this used to be prime time entertainment way back when I was young.  Liked the car commercials better than any of the show.",1417305600,,151,4.357142857142857
3919311,3,B002EQA0X0,Entertaining,1414540800,,12,12.0
3919312,4,B002EQA0X0,"If you are a fan of Danny Thomas and old Road pictures, you will get a lot of laughs from this video. There is truly a lot of fun in this program -- even though our view of the region is now rather devoid of laughs. The ""beauty contest"" bit really cracked me up. (A lot of bitter irony here for women.)

Despite the blurry image, I highly recommend this video if you share my affection for early days of television, old movies, and vaudeville. Excellent entertainment -- all politically incorrect in this day and age.",1410825600,,517,4.385416666666667
