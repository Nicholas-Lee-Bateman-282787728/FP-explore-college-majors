8089033,4,B000BMSUDQ,"Antonio Aguilar, who was born in 1919 in Zacatecas, has been called by some ""The Roy Rogers of Mexico"" because of his superb horsemanship and his wonderful singing voice, talents which he combined in countless films during his very long career, starting in the early 1950s. In this 1955 film, he plays Mauricio Rosales, who to defend the peasants and the honest landowners like his father Maclovio, from the bandits that are taking their money and stealing their cattle, dons a black mask and calls himself ""El Gavilan"" (""The Falcon""). He hides his identity from his father, as well as his pretty cousin, Carmela (Elda Peralta), even when she berates him for not being as brave and idealistic as El Gavilan, who she idolizes.

""El Gavilan Vengador"" was directed by Jaime Salvador, there are 6 songs (""El Gavilan Colorado"" is a favorite), and a well choreographed mano a mano fight between 2 bandits that  is terrific. All in all, ""El Gavilan Vengador"" is good Antonio Aguilar action fare, and the horses are absolutely magnificent. If you like horses, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. There is a 2 disc set available in some stores (for a very nice price) that couples this film with a sequel, ""La Justicia del Gavilan Vengador."" Both films are in excellent condition for their age (the 1st is in b&w, 2nd one in color), and  show Aguilar in his prime, which will be appreciated by an older audience, and the younger folks should check out the father of current singing superstar, Pepe Aguilar. The similarities (except for height...Pepe is very tall), between father and son are remarkable.",1174608000,,1595,4.856617647058823
