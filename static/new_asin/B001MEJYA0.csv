8321106,1,B001MEJYA0,one of the WORST movies i have ever seen!! PAINFUL!! ugh!!! i saw this at a pawn shop for .49 cents and thought 'well maybe' but boy was i wrong!! i fast forwarded through most of it and it def shows that Matthew can only 'act' (if you really want to call it that) as his 'one note' or 'variations of ' his 'Ferris Buellers' character which is fine but for any other movies he is dreadful. (i mean did anyone really believe he was a 'leader' and this o so strong commander or whatever his rank was in Glory'? cmon!) i just kept thinking that if this film had a premiere i would have love to been in that audience when the lights went up to see how embarrassed anyone in this film was n how they would have to pretend that this was such a 'great film' etc lol save yourselves and run away from this one!,1446940800,,802,4.050314465408805
8321107,5,B001MEJYA0,I like the style of this movie. It's very sexy and weird. Julianne Moore wears great clothes in it too.,1402444800,,103,4.2
8321108,1,B001MEJYA0,"Wallace Shawn lives down to his declining reputation with this one.  The script is so clumsy and psuedo-intellectual that even Julianne Moore seemed to struggle with it.  And Mathew Broderick...in a serious role?  What's THAT tell you?

It's hard to believe the author of the marvelous ""The Designated Mourner"" could've fallen so far.",1343174400,,334,5.245283018867925
8321109,3,B001MEJYA0,Can anyone plase tell me what is the name of the song they used in the trailer of this film? Tha last song. Thank You.,1292284800,,118,3.76
8321110,1,B001MEJYA0,"The opening scenes are Juliane Moore doing more cussing than I've heard in the past 5 years.  This movie is just awful.  It makes no sense at all.  The wife follows a dog into this ethereal forest.  She lies down on the ground and that's where I got up, opened my DVD, removed it and tossed it in the garbage.  What a disappointment and I cannot believe great actors such as Moore and Broderick would stoop so low as to make such a horrible horrible movie.  Did't even deserve one star.",1248480000,8,486,4.285714285714286
8321111,5,B001MEJYA0,This was totally worth the wait.  Julianne Moore did a brilliant job of playing the bored wife character against her even more boring husband.  The dialogue and the inner monologues were witty and funny.  Julianne Moore is at her best in this role and look more beautiful than ever.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves the independent film works or something that makes you laugh out-loud from the plainess that it portrays life as.,1239062400,,440,4.75
8321112,2,B001MEJYA0,"Wallace Shawn wrote the very fine 'My Dinner with Andre', a talky but sensitive film that created a niche for conversational stories without plot.  Sadly the qualities of that play to film result did not make it with his MARIE AND BRUCE.  On paper it looks as though this strenuously boring film should be worth watching: Shawn's previous credentials, the direction by Tom Cairns, and the presence of Julianne Moore and  Matthew Broderick together with little feature appearances by the likes of Campbell Scott and Blossom Dearie should suggest investing time in viewing.

Unfortunately the film's premise is so dull that even the technique of having characters speak exactly what is in their minds mixed with dialogue seemingly more appropriate for human ears and adding dreamlike sequences including some rather randy voyeurism - stage worthy though these techniques may be - just can't make this dreary story of a day in the dissolution of a VERY bad marriage work.  The only character in the film with whom the viewer can empathize is a friendly dog.  Pass on this sad flop.  Grady Harp, March 09",1238284800,,1100,4.945652173913044
8321113,3,B001MEJYA0,"""Marie and Bruce,""  based on a play by Wallace Shawn, focuses on one day in the life of a dysfunctional Manhattan couple (Julianne Moore, Matthew Broderick).  The film opens with Marie's pronouncement that their long-deteriorating marriage is over and she is leaving.  During the next 24 hours,  each vents, recalls happier times, and expresses hopes for the future.  Despite a few attempts to open up the action the movie can't shake its stage origins.  It is very talky, and because you have two unhappy people unloading their frustrations and gripes, things become pretty grating.  Both Moore and Broderick are good, but it's hard to warm to their characters.  Though ""Marie and Bruce"" is only 90 minutes long, it seems endless.  Language is often profane and there is some nudity, which explains the R rating.  There are no bonus extras in this bare-bones edition.",1237420800,4,868,5.006993006993007
8321114,2,B001MEJYA0,"This took five years for Genius to get around onto DVD, but I suppose they are trying to span some of their little-known sets like this over time. Am still trying to find a category for this, but mostly it fits into the day in the life of a dysfunctional marriage in Manhattan film.

Julianne Moore is why I watch any movie, and in the end, was the only reason I suffered through to see the credits role. Imagine a mix of What Dreams May Come, meets Blindness, meets Broderick running from the Out on a Limb set (filmed locally here and I swear he is wearing the same clothes and glasses) meets a mid-life crisis. The film is narrated by our married couple both to the camera and in their heads, sometimes blurring what is real and what becomes a dream through the coarse of one day in the city.

The dialogue becomes so tedious and frustrating by anyone who opens their mouth that you wish it would have stayed on the stage, as I believe this was the original location of this pedantic story. I cannot find the words to describe the variety of self loathing narratives and forced conversations. To summarize briefly, nothing jumped out at me to hold an interest and I give it another star just on JM's ability to hold a film together with her expressions and genuine look of disgust in what she is doing.

No extras to speak of from Genius once again.",1236902400,2,1352,4.378486055776892
