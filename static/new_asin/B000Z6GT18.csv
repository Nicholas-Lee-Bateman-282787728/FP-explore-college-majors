3038064,5,B000Z6GT18,"Naturally I would have given my favorite TV show ten stars, but since they're only releasing half of the first season, it only gets 5. How disappointing to have been counting the days to 2008 (for 2 years -- since its 2006 delayed release date) only to find out all you get is half. I hope they fire whoever made that decision. I'll rent from NetFlix and wait to buy -- when I can buy the whole set.",1200960000,3,399,4.128205128205129

3038067,5,B000Z6GT18,"I don't have a problem with buying volume 1 of the Love Boat.
It is a lower price than a complete season, and more people may buy tv dvd sets this way.
The only issue I have is this:  The release schedule.  The studio should release a volume every three months, this way we know they mean buisness.  IF there is one thing that hinders a tv dvd set, it would have to be chaotic release schedules.  Releasing the first volume, followed by volume two 12 months(or longer)later will  be the nail in the coffin for volume sets.  We will have to wait and see if a major studio can finally get a decent timeline for tv dvd releases!",1200268800,7,625,4.2100840336134455

Unlike Love American Style, the stories were intertwined rather than telecast consecutively, featuring the guest stars along with a regular cast. Namely, the crew of the Pacific Princess. Starring as the ship's crew were Gavin MacLeod (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) as Captain Merrill Stubing; Bernie Kopell (Get Smart) as ""Doc"" Adam Bricker; Fred Grandy as yeoman-purser Burl ""Gopher"" Smith; Ted Lange (That's My Mama) as bartender Isaac Washington; and Lauren Tewes as cruise director Julie McCoy. One of the most popular new shows of the 1977-78 season, The Love Boat received an extra boost in ratings when it was paired with similar hit series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasy-Island/dp/B000B8IA3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasy Island</a>&nbsp;the following season. From the lyrics (""Come aboard, we're expecting you"") in the theme song performed by Jack Jones to the personalized opening cast credits (""Starring your Love Boat crew""...), the show purposely gave the impression that you (the viewer) were taking the cruises. It's good to see the show finally come to DVD. The Love Boat - Season One, Volume One is a 3-disc (622 min.) set featuring the show's first 12 hour-long Season One episodes; Full Frame (1.33:1) video; English, Spanish mono audio; Closed Captions; English, Spanish subtitles.

3038069,3,B000Z6GT18,"When are the studios going to learn that NOBODY likes buying HALF A FREAKIN' SEASON! ?

Pay full price for half the episodes and then play the ""waiting game"" for the rest of the season? PATHETIC! We already wait too long as it is for most follow up seasons, now they have us waiting around for the other HALF of a season!

I predict that profits will be FAR LESS for the studio because of the decision to split the season into two volumes. Most potential buyers will wait for a decent price drop, or the lower priced ""used"" sets that should quickly become available.

Here's a glimpse at SOME of the great guest stars in the first 12 epsiodes;

John Ritter, Suzanne Somers, Jaclyn Smith, Meredith Baxter Birney, Jimmie Walker, Sherman Hemsley, LaWanda Page, Kristy McNichol, Scott Baio, Richard Mulligan, Milton Berle, Charo, Bill Bixby, Jim Nabors, Patty Duke, Tab Hunter, Steve Allen, Sandy Duncan, Loni Anderson, Phil Silvers, Joanna Kerns, Jane Curtin, Leslie Nielsen, Robert Urich, Florence Henderson, Donna Mills, Dick Sargent, Pat Morita, and Anson Williams.

Not too shabby huh?

3038146,5,B000Z6GT18,"Unfortunately they decided to split the first season of this show into two sets. That aside, this is a show that weathered the test of time fairly well. The first season was back in the late 1970s and it shows here and there with the clothes and reserved acting, but many of the stories are fairly durable and entertaining. There are a couple of storylines that are duds or are a bit dated, but overall, they are enjoyable. There's a reason this show lasted a while. In some ways, it was probably ahead of its time. Many of the main characters became well-loved. The captain started out being a bit more cranky and aloof in the early episodes but he seemed more comfortable in his role by the end of this half-season of episodes. Each episode has three storylines, all with visiting guest stars which means the list of famous actors who appeared on the show was extensive. It is interesting to see some well known Hollywood personalities in their younger years. This set is worth getting, even though you only get half the season. It's not very expensive and you can buy both halves of the season for a reasonable price.",1383350400,3,1120,4.5495049504950495

3038167,5,B000Z6GT18,"The pleasure of your company is requested at the Captain's table for dinner, dancing, loopy 1970's hijinks...and Love!

This series is like going straight to dessert.  There's no meat and potatoes here, just delectable, frothy sweets.  For some, it's a guilty pleasure.  But I have no guilt about it; sometimes I just want a cupcake.

Captain Stubing (Gavin MacLeod), Cruise Director Julie (Lauren Tewes), Ship's Doctor Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), Bartender Isaac (Ted Lange) and Purser Gopher (Fred Gandy) are your regulars and the anchors of the show, if you'll pardon the pun.  They're a family of sorts and the audience becomes involved in their lives and many loves.

One of the great things about this show is that it is like a Who's Who of 1970's/80's T.V. and film.  Part of the fun is to see who will show up next.  Each show provides several vignettes and offers up stars galore.  It was also a great venue for older film stars.  In season one (1977), volume one, you'll find:  Bonnie Franklin, Suzanne Somers, John Ritter, Jaclyn Smith, Robert Reed, Milton Berle, Charo, Michelle Lee, Diahann Carroll, Ray Bolger, Harriet Nelson, Steve Allen, Loni Anderson, Eva Gabor, Donna Mills, John Gavin, Polly Bergen, Phil Silvers and many more.

There are 12, one-hour episodes on good quality DVD's.  The shows look great.  The stories consist of people going on a cruise, often falling in love or dealing with their relationship problems.  But even when there's a problem, Gopher is always there to crack a joke, Isaac mixes a drink and Julie gets them out on the dance floor.  Frankly, it makes me want to go on vacation...in the 70's!

Life can get exhausting sometimes; we can't always go on vacation, but thankfully, we have this show...and cupcakes.  Set sail!",1340064000,3,1771,4.882550335570469

3038169,5,B000Z6GT18,"this show was i of my favorites back in the 70's and the theme song gets me into a happy mood every time i listen to it. Back to a time when it was good to stay home and watch a good tv show and the Love Boat was one of those shows I once again will enjoy watching this 3 disc of season 1...Bonvoyage, anchor's away",1334361600,,315,3.716417910447761
3038170,4,B000Z6GT18,I guess watching 3-4 episodes back to back to back wore on me. I guess there's a reason why regular tv shows are on just once a week. This was a great show back in the day from what I remember of it and I guess times have passed it by. The way they talked on it had me shaking my head. It comes out to about $1 per episode. I won't get the second half of the first season or any other season. It was good while it lasted.,1334016000,,421,3.688888888888889
3038171,3,B000Z6GT18,"This is the first PART of season 1, and I don't plan to purchase the rest to complete the season.

I bought this for the nostalgia factor, so just a few episodes are enough.  It is generally a feel-good show, and the cameos from stars of the time are fun. It is also an interesting snapshot of the culture of the time.  It is interesting to compare the way people speak, they way they dress, they way they interact, and the expectation of what is considered ""luxury"" for the time to today's standards.
Unfortunately, I find that modern TV programs have raised my expectations for entertainment, and I have trouble watching this.  The simplistic plots and era-appropriate sexism kind of grate on my nerves.

Due to the time allotted to each sub-plot, the guests are pretty one-dimensional, but is sweet to see the family-like relationships between the crew, and their antics can be pretty funny if you realize that you are not supposed to take the show too seriously.  The crew plots are definately more engaging than the guest plots, purely because the crew members have enough screen time to be more developed characters - and they tend to be likable ones.",1323820800,,1157,4.702970297029703
3038172,5,B000Z6GT18,"I was a young teen when this show aired in the late seventies. To me then it was fun and uplifting, I had to watch it every week. Its nice to relive the memories and to see the special guest stars of yesterday and yes to me its still alot of fun to watch. I hope all 10 seasons get released on DVD.",1322092800,2,298,3.746031746031746
3038173,3,B000Z6GT18,"The DVDs are OK, despite no extras, but the subtitles aren't good. They don't subtitle things like ""Wow!"" at all, for instance. The subtitles don't add extra stuff, but the deletions are legion, plus there are several spelling mistakes. It's very disappointing for such a famous show.

Otherwise, I thought the quality of the DVDs was fine, but I would've appreciated some interviews or whatever as extras; sometimes I prefer the extra stuff to the movies themselves!! The masters appeared to have been cleaned up a good bit, judging by other series' from that time frame.",1309651200,2,572,4.958333333333333
3038174,5,B000Z6GT18,"I love ""The Love Boat"" it is such a fun(ny) series that everyone will appreciate because it's like you're going along on the cruise with everyone, too. My favorite thing about watching ""The Love Boat"" besides it's fantastic cast (see below for that) of recurring stars and an endless list of revolving stars (such as Charo, Bonnie Franklin, Milton Berle, Bill Bixby, Florence Henderson, Patty Duke and many, many, many, many more) has always been the theme song. It is so inviting and almost has a romantic quality to it.

Since this was an anthology series the stories did not necessarily revolve around the cruiseship crew, yet unlike most anthologies ""The Love Boat"" thrived because there was always a sense of continuity with the cast, which included:
Gavin MacLeod as your captain, Merrill Stubing
Lauren Tewes as your activities director, Julie
Ted Lange as your bartender, Isaac
Fred Grandy as your yeoman purser, Gopher
Bernie Kopell as the ship's doctor, Doc Bricker

This includes the first 12 eps from S1 (this does not include the original movies) on 3 discs. Each ep rounds out at about 45 minutes in total and the best that I can tell these are the unedited eps. (I have no way of knowing for certain as ""The Love Boat"" predates my arrival on this planet by many years). Special features include the original episodic promos which I understand were shown as ""teasers"" before each ep. Also included on the inside of the DVD inlay are some trivia questions.

Each ep has 3 stories that intermingled with the others. There was never really a star of any particular show, rather there were many stars because everyone shined on their own and I love the way the stories fell into each other. For example on the show when Charo crashed the ship she was seen singing for everyone that the ep revolved around. It's very difficult to pick a favorite ep because each one is just as good as the one that proceeded it. I did especially enjoy the Christmas ep, because besides the Grinch who wouldn't want to go on a Christmas cruise? One more thing I gotta say is that there's a lot of comedy in each and every ep. It's such a breath of fresh air because the jokes are wholesome yet very easy to laugh along with. There is almost a timeless quality to the themes and references made that everyone is able to relate to by finding some comedy within it.

This is packaged in a clear plastic case which includes each of the show titles listed on the inside (each show has 3 titles as there are 3 stories per ep). By the way, I posted a scan of this as well as a scan of the 3 DVDs and the back cover of the case.

Watching this 3-disc set was like taking a cruise again (although surprisingly a lot less hassle and a lot more fun, and not surprisingly, not as expensive). There is such a sense of almost macabre adventure in each ep. And no the acting wasn't always Emmy-worthy and some of the singing and dancing were over-the-top, but you know what, that's OK, too. It's just so much fun to watch. If you enjoy old school and classic TV shows you will want to get ""The Love Boat"" S1 V1. It's an open smile to a friendly shore.",1300579200,5,3127,4.469352014010508
3038175,5,B000Z6GT18,"I bought this because my daughter now works on a cruise ship, and she didn't know who ""Julie McCoy"" was.  I bought it to share with her, because several of my friends and myself would reference things from the show.  It was fun to watch and reminisce about watching it back in the early 80's.  It's also fun to see the then up-and-coming starts on the show.",1299196800,,357,4.298507462686567

3038187,5,B000Z6GT18,"I never really watched The Love Boat when it was out in reruns but thought I would give it a try since I like TV from that era.  I have to say that it is hilarious!  Each epiosde was so funny from start to finish. I haven't laughed so hard at a TV show in a long time!  The guest stars are great including many that I was familiar with from 'The Brady Bunch' and who can forget Jim Neighbors from 'Gomer Pyle'- another one of my 70's favorites. The characters are realistic and I love how each of the episodes has 3 little plots that are weaved together.  I only wish I could take a cruise on this boat!

I can hardly wait until my next DVD arrives.  I will have to say that the discs are a little pricey, but worth it since it is an hour long show (and the lack of commercials is always priceless).  I wish they released the seasons one at a time instead of in volumes, but like some of my other favorites I will take them any way I can get them.  I hope that seasons 3 through the end are released soon.  I will definately buy them all!  It seems like it takes forever for all of the good shows (Gunsmoke, The Love Boat, Night Court, Mama's Family, Hunter, etc,) to come out on DVD but the studios release all the garbage right away.",1265328000,,1235,4.045267489711934
3038188,4,B000Z6GT18,"The Love Boat was a fun show and I'm glad to see it on DVD. After the first ""season"" I wouldn't consider it as much a family show, but was still quite tame compared to todays shows. As for those griping about the split ""season"", what you really want is the first year, not first season. A season, when this show was created, was 12-13 episodes, 2 seasons a year--Spring and Fall. Times change, though, and now a season refers to a year. Makes no sense, don't know why they don't just say the first year, but that's Hollywood for you.",1235260800,,533,4.287128712871287

So please if your going to produce these great retro shows put them out as a complete series. This is why I have stopped buying until I see a trend of a few seasons in the bag before I buy. After all they are over 30 years in the can and could be put out at one time and give you a very good profit and in todays market that is a good way to go. So please listen to your buyers and give what they want. Which is a thought from the retro world too you know when the customer was always RIGHT. Hope your listening also STOP the Vol one and two I ought one show like that have not done it again when I seen what I paid for it Remember the 30 or more years  these shows are.

The fact that I'll never be able to own my very own set makes me sad but at least I get to see the shows again. They did this with Lost in Space as well and I can't afford that set either.

The story lines are simplistic and predictable.  The crew is also predictable.  Doc always chases women.  Gopher is always silly.  Julie is always helpful.  Isaac is always cool.  Captain Stubing is always the boss of them all.  It is comforting to know that some things never change.

The twelve episodes included in this set (the first half of Season One) reminded me why I fell in love with this cute series in the first place.

Come aboard the Pacific Princess, with Captain Stubing (Gavin MacLeod in his first TV starring role following the demise of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""), Doc (Bernie Kopell), friendly barman Isaac (Ted Lange), Gopher (Fred Grandy), and adorable cruise director Julie (Lauren Tewes).

This was the epitome of ""Glam TV"", a few years before shows like ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" took the genre to dizzying new heights.  The guest stars literally queued up to be a part of this show, because as well as having a fun acting gig, they got a free cruise!  The Pacific Princess ship was a fully-functional vessel, and the bulk of the series was shot in and around it.  And didn't we all have a crush on Julie McCoy, the cruise director, played so perfectly by Ms Tewes?

The twelve episodes included in this set feature lots of familiar faces, with Michele Lee, Diahann Carroll, Bonnie Franklin, Suzanne Somers, Charo (the first of her MANY appearances during the show's run), and Patty Duke having some particularly appealing storylines.  It's especially fun to see a young Kristy McNichol, sharing an episode with her future ""Empty Nest"" dad, Richard Mulligan!

3038240,3,B000Z6GT18,"Despite the Love Boat's lightweight fun-and-romance plots, it was a heavyweight television series that ran 10 years and defined the blazing success of Aaron Spelling Productions. The Love Boat was one of the first 60-minute programs with a laugh track, and its weekly trio of intertwined storylines created a more compelling hour-long viewing experience than unconnected linear anthologies like ""Love, American Style.""

What really put the Love Boat into its own class, however, was its expansive list of guest stars. The weekly cavalcade mixed entertainment legends (Milton Berle, Ruth Gordon, Patty Duke, Ray Bolger, Harriet Nelson), with an oversized helping `70s TV stars (Jimmie Walker, Bonnie Franklin, Suzanne Somers, John Ritter, Jaclyn Smith, Sherman Helmsley, LaWanda Page, Kristy McNichol, Scott Baio), and everything in between. The guest lists always held surprises, and in retrospect now provide terrific nostalgia.

The program's regular cast, which took three pilots to coalesce, is the anchor upon which the program grew. Gavin McLeod brought the comedic edge of The Mary Tyler Moore's Murray Slaughter, but in a fatherly character (figuratively in the early seasons, literally once daughter Vicki was added) who heads the crew. Second in seniority, both as an actor and a character, was Bernie Kopell's Dr. Adam Bricker. Kopell was a character actor throughout the `60s, creating memorable characters on both ""Get Smart"" and ""That Girl"" at decade's end. As the ship's multiply-divorced lothario, Dr. Bricker bridged the maturity of McLeod's Captain Stubing to the crew's younger members.

Fred Grandy, Ted Lange and Lauren Tewes had shorter resumes than their senior officers, but quickly showed themselves to be loaded with comic talent. Grandy and Lange came on board for the film's second pilot (not included here), and proved essential elements in selling the show to ABC and sustaining the program season after season. By the show's third pilot, the crew was settled with the additions of McLeod, Kopell and Tewes, and though the characters weren't yet fully formed (particularly the tone of their interpersonal relationships), the chemistry between the actors was evident from the start.

With so much going for it, and a broad fan base waiting for the show to appear on DVD, it's surprising to find Paramount's first offering so lackluster. First, this three-disc set includes only half the first season - 12 of 25 episodes. Second, the only bonuses are the brief promo spots that ran the week preceding an episode. Third, and worst, is the absence of all three pilot movies. The first pilot, featuring an entirely different crew was previously issued on VHS, but is now out of print. Pilots #2 and #3, the latter being the lead-in to the series, are unavailable through commercial sources.

After such a long wait it's disappointing to get only half of the first season, to have it priced at $50+ per season, to get no extras (no making-of, no contemporary interviews, no photo gallery, no production ephemera), and to have the pilot movies omitted. It's great to have the first dozen episodes in hand, but Paramount's presentation isn't the first-class cruise it should be. 5-stars for the original episodes, 2-stars for the low-budget package.

Wow, the Love Boat finally washed ashore onto DVD.

I am ticked like everyone else is that it is only 12 episode (half of the full 24 first season episodes) I am upset that NONE of  the THREE Love Boat pre-series TV movies are included on this DVD. I am upset that there is no reunion special extra on DVD that most first season DVDs have(DVD like McHale's Navy, Growing Pains, Family Ties had them) . Also there is NO cast commentaries on any episodes. OKAY, that the bad news

Come Aboard, we're expecting you....

This Saturday evening stample of 1980's is a cute and corny show for family fun. The show was NEVER five star classical acting that would win any Emmys, just popcorn fun...that why its rated 4 stars, even now on DVD!  The reason Love Boat was a staple for eight seasons was the simple storytelling with a family like crew. It had guess stars who you knew from other TV shows and were familar with. It was a formula for entertainment, but it works!

The Love Boat soon will be making another run....

One can hope the rest of season one will arrive soon. I still enjoyed the shows on this 12 episode DVD...I would have liked like everyone else had expressed and  wanted a full season, but that is what the DVD  makers are doing these days. Charging more money for less product, it is the nature of business

Welcome Aboard, It's LOVE, LOVE, LOVE

It is well worth  to have a show where there is NO foul language...No car chases..No heavy duty issues..and a family can sit and enjoy this kind of television TOGETHER. There are not many things you can enjoy together these days. Love will never go out of style.

Hmmm.  Anthology series.  Not quite like ""American Style"", a little on the soft side.  Rotating characters?  No.  Cruise Ship.  Flirty employees.  Wide open ocean.  A million stories.  Do you think CBS will go for it?

Well.  We could use co-stars from the CBS shows.  Two or three short stories wrapped into a single show.  Do you think the regulars could build romances too?

Nope.  But they could play match maker every now and then.

Let's give it a shot!

If it didn't go like that, then perhaps it should have.  ""The Love Boat"" started in 1977, the same year Spiderman, Mash, and Happy Days were on TV screens everywhere.  The concept struck a chord, and stayed on the seas for 9 years until 1986.  Based on the novel of the same name, it is as fresh as it was the first time around.

The ensemble cast of the show included Gavin McLeod as Captain Stubing, Bernie Kopell as Doc, Fred Grandy as Gopher, Ted Lange as the bartender, and Lauren Tewes as the Cruise Director.  As a TV show, it is also memorable for the list of co-stars to grace the decks.  Meredith Baxter Birney, Suzanne Somers, Jacylyn Smith, Robert Reed, Loretta Switt, Milton Berle, Bill Bixby, Charo, Jim Nabors, Ray Bolger, Steve Allen, Gary Burghoff, Phil Silvers, Leslie Nielsen, Arte Johnson, and so many more appeared in cruise ship vignettes.  Charming to a fault, if the plot of one of the Pacific Princess threads didn't get you, the scenery would.

Paramount/CBS/Spelling TV have set us on a journey across the world.  Perhaps this is the impetus for a NEW Love Boat?  There's always room on the TV schedule for a good anthology series.

It is a lower price than a complete season, and more people may buy tv dvd sets this way.

IF there is one thing that hinders a tv dvd set, it would have to be chaotic release schedules.  Releasing the first volume, followed by volume two 12 months(or longer)later will  be the nail in the coffin for volume sets.

Unlike Love American Style, the stories were intertwined rather than telecast consecutively, featuring the guest stars along with a regular cast. Namely, the crew of the Pacific Princess. Starring as the ship's crew were Gavin MacLeod (The Mary Tyler Moore Show) as Captain Merrill Stubing; Bernie Kopell (Get Smart) as ""Doc"" Adam Bricker; Fred Grandy as yeoman-purser Burl ""Gopher"" Smith; Ted Lange (That's My Mama) as bartender Isaac Washington; and Lauren Tewes as cruise director Julie McCoy. One of the most popular new shows of the 1977-78 season, The Love Boat received an extra boost in ratings when it was paired with similar hit series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasy-Island/dp/B000B8IA3U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasy Island</a>&nbsp;the following season. From the lyrics (""Come aboard, we're expecting you"") in the theme song performed by Jack Jones to the personalized opening cast credits (""Starring your Love Boat crew""...), the show purposely gave the impression that you (the viewer) were taking the cruises. It's good to see the show finally come to DVD. The Love Boat - Season One, Volume One is a 3-disc (622 min.) set featuring the show's first 12 hour-long Season One episodes; Full Frame (1.33:1) video; English, Spanish mono audio; Closed Captions; English, Spanish subtitles.

3272566,3,B000Z6GT18,"When are the studios going to learn that NOBODY likes buying HALF A FREAKIN' SEASON! ?

Pay full price for half the episodes and then play the ""waiting game"" for the rest of the season? PATHETIC! We already wait too long as it is for most follow up seasons, now they have us waiting around for the other HALF of a season!

I predict that profits will be FAR LESS for the studio because of the decision to split the season into two volumes. Most potential buyers will wait for a decent price drop, or the lower priced ""used"" sets that should quickly become available.

Here's a glimpse at SOME of the great guest stars in the first 12 epsiodes;

John Ritter, Suzanne Somers, Jaclyn Smith, Meredith Baxter Birney, Jimmie Walker, Sherman Hemsley, LaWanda Page, Kristy McNichol, Scott Baio, Richard Mulligan, Milton Berle, Charo, Bill Bixby, Jim Nabors, Patty Duke, Tab Hunter, Steve Allen, Sandy Duncan, Loni Anderson, Phil Silvers, Joanna Kerns, Jane Curtin, Leslie Nielsen, Robert Urich, Florence Henderson, Donna Mills, Dick Sargent, Pat Morita, and Anson Williams.

The first season was back in the late 1970s and it shows here and there with the clothes and reserved acting, but many of the stories are fairly durable and entertaining. There are a couple of storylines that are duds or are a bit dated, but overall, they are enjoyable. There's a reason this show lasted a while. In some ways, it was probably ahead of its time. Many of the main characters became well-loved. The captain started out being a bit more cranky and aloof in the early episodes but he seemed more comfortable in his role by the end of this half-season of episodes. Each episode has three storylines, all with visiting guest stars which means the list of famous actors who appeared on the show was extensive. It is interesting to see some well known Hollywood personalities in their younger years. This set is worth getting, even though you only get half the season.

3272664,5,B000Z6GT18,"The pleasure of your company is requested at the Captain's table for dinner, dancing, loopy 1970's hijinks...and Love!

This series is like going straight to dessert.  There's no meat and potatoes here, just delectable, frothy sweets.  For some, it's a guilty pleasure.  But I have no guilt about it; sometimes I just want a cupcake.

Captain Stubing (Gavin MacLeod), Cruise Director Julie (Lauren Tewes), Ship's Doctor Adam Bricker (Bernie Kopell), Bartender Isaac (Ted Lange) and Purser Gopher (Fred Gandy) are your regulars and the anchors of the show, if you'll pardon the pun.  They're a family of sorts and the audience becomes involved in their lives and many loves.

One of the great things about this show is that it is like a Who's Who of 1970's/80's T.V. and film.  Part of the fun is to see who will show up next.  Each show provides several vignettes and offers up stars galore.  It was also a great venue for older film stars.  In season one (1977), volume one, you'll find:  Bonnie Franklin, Suzanne Somers, John Ritter, Jaclyn Smith, Robert Reed, Milton Berle, Charo, Michelle Lee, Diahann Carroll, Ray Bolger, Harriet Nelson, Steve Allen, Loni Anderson, Eva Gabor, Donna Mills, John Gavin, Polly Bergen, Phil Silvers and many more.

There are 12, one-hour episodes on good quality DVD's.  The shows look great.  The stories consist of people going on a cruise, often falling in love or dealing with their relationship problems.  But even when there's a problem, Gopher is always there to crack a joke, Isaac mixes a drink and Julie gets them out on the dance floor.  Frankly, it makes me want to go on vacation...in the 70's!

Life can get exhausting sometimes; we can't always go on vacation, but thankfully, we have this show...and cupcakes.  Set sail!",1340064000,3,1771,4.882550335570469

3272666,5,B000Z6GT18,"this show was i of my favorites back in the 70's and the theme song gets me into a happy mood every time i listen to it. Back to a time when it was good to stay home and watch a good tv show and the Love Boat was one of those shows I once again will enjoy watching this 3 disc of season 1...Bonvoyage, anchor's away",1334361600,,315,3.716417910447761
3272667,4,B000Z6GT18,I guess watching 3-4 episodes back to back to back wore on me. I guess there's a reason why regular tv shows are on just once a week. This was a great show back in the day from what I remember of it and I guess times have passed it by. The way they talked on it had me shaking my head. It comes out to about $1 per episode. I won't get the second half of the first season or any other season. It was good while it lasted.,1334016000,,421,3.688888888888889
3272668,3,B000Z6GT18,"This is the first PART of season 1, and I don't plan to purchase the rest to complete the season.

I bought this for the nostalgia factor, so just a few episodes are enough.  It is generally a feel-good show, and the cameos from stars of the time are fun. It is also an interesting snapshot of the culture of the time.  It is interesting to compare the way people speak, they way they dress, they way they interact, and the expectation of what is considered ""luxury"" for the time to today's standards.
Unfortunately, I find that modern TV programs have raised my expectations for entertainment, and I have trouble watching this.  The simplistic plots and era-appropriate sexism kind of grate on my nerves.

Due to the time allotted to each sub-plot, the guests are pretty one-dimensional, but is sweet to see the family-like relationships between the crew, and their antics can be pretty funny if you realize that you are not supposed to take the show too seriously.  The crew plots are definately more engaging than the guest plots, purely because the crew members have enough screen time to be more developed characters - and they tend to be likable ones.",1323820800,,1157,4.702970297029703
3272669,5,B000Z6GT18,"I was a young teen when this show aired in the late seventies. To me then it was fun and uplifting, I had to watch it every week. Its nice to relive the memories and to see the special guest stars of yesterday and yes to me its still alot of fun to watch. I hope all 10 seasons get released on DVD.",1322092800,2,298,3.746031746031746
3272670,3,B000Z6GT18,"The DVDs are OK, despite no extras, but the subtitles aren't good. They don't subtitle things like ""Wow!"" at all, for instance. The subtitles don't add extra stuff, but the deletions are legion, plus there are several spelling mistakes. It's very disappointing for such a famous show.

Otherwise, I thought the quality of the DVDs was fine, but I would've appreciated some interviews or whatever as extras; sometimes I prefer the extra stuff to the movies themselves!! The masters appeared to have been cleaned up a good bit, judging by other series' from that time frame.",1309651200,2,572,4.958333333333333
3272671,5,B000Z6GT18,"I love ""The Love Boat"" it is such a fun(ny) series that everyone will appreciate because it's like you're going along on the cruise with everyone, too. My favorite thing about watching ""The Love Boat"" besides it's fantastic cast (see below for that) of recurring stars and an endless list of revolving stars (such as Charo, Bonnie Franklin, Milton Berle, Bill Bixby, Florence Henderson, Patty Duke and many, many, many, many more) has always been the theme song. It is so inviting and almost has a romantic quality to it.

Since this was an anthology series the stories did not necessarily revolve around the cruiseship crew, yet unlike most anthologies ""The Love Boat"" thrived because there was always a sense of continuity with the cast, which included:
Gavin MacLeod as your captain, Merrill Stubing
Lauren Tewes as your activities director, Julie
Ted Lange as your bartender, Isaac
Fred Grandy as your yeoman purser, Gopher
Bernie Kopell as the ship's doctor, Doc Bricker

This includes the first 12 eps from S1 (this does not include the original movies) on 3 discs. Each ep rounds out at about 45 minutes in total and the best that I can tell these are the unedited eps. (I have no way of knowing for certain as ""The Love Boat"" predates my arrival on this planet by many years). Special features include the original episodic promos which I understand were shown as ""teasers"" before each ep. Also included on the inside of the DVD inlay are some trivia questions.

Each ep has 3 stories that intermingled with the others. There was never really a star of any particular show, rather there were many stars because everyone shined on their own and I love the way the stories fell into each other. For example on the show when Charo crashed the ship she was seen singing for everyone that the ep revolved around. It's very difficult to pick a favorite ep because each one is just as good as the one that proceeded it. I did especially enjoy the Christmas ep, because besides the Grinch who wouldn't want to go on a Christmas cruise? One more thing I gotta say is that there's a lot of comedy in each and every ep. It's such a breath of fresh air because the jokes are wholesome yet very easy to laugh along with. There is almost a timeless quality to the themes and references made that everyone is able to relate to by finding some comedy within it.

This is packaged in a clear plastic case which includes each of the show titles listed on the inside (each show has 3 titles as there are 3 stories per ep). By the way, I posted a scan of this as well as a scan of the 3 DVDs and the back cover of the case.

Watching this 3-disc set was like taking a cruise again (although surprisingly a lot less hassle and a lot more fun, and not surprisingly, not as expensive). There is such a sense of almost macabre adventure in each ep. And no the acting wasn't always Emmy-worthy and some of the singing and dancing were over-the-top, but you know what, that's OK, too. It's just so much fun to watch. If you enjoy old school and classic TV shows you will want to get ""The Love Boat"" S1 V1. It's an open smile to a friendly shore.",1300579200,5,3127,4.469352014010508
3272672,5,B000Z6GT18,"I bought this because my daughter now works on a cruise ship, and she didn't know who ""Julie McCoy"" was.  I bought it to share with her, because several of my friends and myself would reference things from the show.  It was fun to watch and reminisce about watching it back in the early 80's.  It's also fun to see the then up-and-coming starts on the show.",1299196800,,357,4.298507462686567

3272684,5,B000Z6GT18,"I never really watched The Love Boat when it was out in reruns but thought I would give it a try since I like TV from that era.  I have to say that it is hilarious!  Each epiosde was so funny from start to finish. I haven't laughed so hard at a TV show in a long time!  The guest stars are great including many that I was familiar with from 'The Brady Bunch' and who can forget Jim Neighbors from 'Gomer Pyle'- another one of my 70's favorites. The characters are realistic and I love how each of the episodes has 3 little plots that are weaved together.  I only wish I could take a cruise on this boat!

I can hardly wait until my next DVD arrives.  I will have to say that the discs are a little pricey, but worth it since it is an hour long show (and the lack of commercials is always priceless).  I wish they released the seasons one at a time instead of in volumes, but like some of my other favorites I will take them any way I can get them.  I hope that seasons 3 through the end are released soon.  I will definately buy them all!  It seems like it takes forever for all of the good shows (Gunsmoke, The Love Boat, Night Court, Mama's Family, Hunter, etc,) to come out on DVD but the studios release all the garbage right away.",1265328000,,1235,4.045267489711934
3272685,4,B000Z6GT18,"The Love Boat was a fun show and I'm glad to see it on DVD. After the first ""season"" I wouldn't consider it as much a family show, but was still quite tame compared to todays shows. As for those griping about the split ""season"", what you really want is the first year, not first season. A season, when this show was created, was 12-13 episodes, 2 seasons a year--Spring and Fall. Times change, though, and now a season refers to a year. Makes no sense, don't know why they don't just say the first year, but that's Hollywood for you.",1235260800,,533,4.287128712871287

3272687,5,B000Z6GT18,I too loved the show but with the rack I have with all the one season TV shows I have because the producers of these TV on DVD only doing one or two seasons then leaving us high and dry then us going into the deep end and buying a complete series from a shady company that are very badly made but you expect them to be like purchased in our stores but sadly not the case. So please if your going to produce these great retro shows put them out as a complete series. This is why I have stopped buying until I see a trend of a few seasons in the bag before I buy. After all they are over 30 years in the can and could be put out at one time and give you a very good profit and in todays market that is a good way to go. So please listen to your buyers and give what they want. Which is a thought from the retro world too you know when the customer was always RIGHT. Hope your listening also STOP the Vol one and two I ought one show like that have not done it again when I seen what I paid for it Remember the 30 or more years  these shows are.

Since they split up each season and charged a hefty price tag for this show, I won't be able to purchase it but that's why I got Netflix. The fact that I'll never be able to own my very own set makes me sad but at least I get to see the shows again. They did this with Lost in Space as well and I can't afford that set either. This is good, clean, wholesome TV from back in the day. Great for families to watch together. A bit dated but it's fun to see the clothing and hairstyles from the era.",1227052800,,545,3.875

The story lines are simplistic and predictable.  The crew is also predictable.  Doc always chases women.  Gopher is always silly.  Julie is always helpful.  Isaac is always cool.  Captain Stubing is always the boss of them all.  It is comforting to know that some things never change.

The twelve episodes included in this set (the first half of Season One) reminded me why I fell in love with this cute series in the first place.

Come aboard the Pacific Princess, with Captain Stubing (Gavin MacLeod in his first TV starring role following the demise of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show""), Doc (Bernie Kopell), friendly barman Isaac (Ted Lange), Gopher (Fred Grandy), and adorable cruise director Julie (Lauren Tewes).

This was the epitome of ""Glam TV"", a few years before shows like ""Dallas"" and ""Dynasty"" took the genre to dizzying new heights.  The guest stars literally queued up to be a part of this show, because as well as having a fun acting gig, they got a free cruise!  The Pacific Princess ship was a fully-functional vessel, and the bulk of the series was shot in and around it.  And didn't we all have a crush on Julie McCoy, the cruise director, played so perfectly by Ms Tewes?

The twelve episodes included in this set feature lots of familiar faces, with Michele Lee, Diahann Carroll, Bonnie Franklin, Suzanne Somers, Charo (the first of her MANY appearances during the show's run), and Patty Duke having some particularly appealing storylines.  It's especially fun to see a young Kristy McNichol, sharing an episode with her future ""Empty Nest"" dad, Richard Mulligan!

The Love Boat was one of the first 60-minute programs with a laugh track, and its weekly trio of intertwined storylines created a more compelling hour-long viewing experience than unconnected linear anthologies like ""Love, American Style.""

What really put the Love Boat into its own class, however, was its expansive list of guest stars. The weekly cavalcade mixed entertainment legends (Milton Berle, Ruth Gordon, Patty Duke, Ray Bolger, Harriet Nelson), with an oversized helping `70s TV stars (Jimmie Walker, Bonnie Franklin, Suzanne Somers, John Ritter, Jaclyn Smith, Sherman Helmsley, LaWanda Page, Kristy McNichol, Scott Baio), and everything in between. The guest lists always held surprises, and in retrospect now provide terrific nostalgia.

The program's regular cast, which took three pilots to coalesce, is the anchor upon which the program grew. Gavin McLeod brought the comedic edge of The Mary Tyler Moore's Murray Slaughter, but in a fatherly character (figuratively in the early seasons, literally once daughter Vicki was added) who heads the crew. Second in seniority, both as an actor and a character, was Bernie Kopell's Dr. Adam Bricker. Kopell was a character actor throughout the `60s, creating memorable characters on both ""Get Smart"" and ""That Girl"" at decade's end. As the ship's multiply-divorced lothario, Dr. Bricker bridged the maturity of McLeod's Captain Stubing to the crew's younger members.

Fred Grandy, Ted Lange and Lauren Tewes had shorter resumes than their senior officers, but quickly showed themselves to be loaded with comic talent. Grandy and Lange came on board for the film's second pilot (not included here), and proved essential elements in selling the show to ABC and sustaining the program season after season. By the show's third pilot, the crew was settled with the additions of McLeod, Kopell and Tewes, and though the characters weren't yet fully formed (particularly the tone of their interpersonal relationships), the chemistry between the actors was evident from the start.

With so much going for it, and a broad fan base waiting for the show to appear on DVD, it's surprising to find Paramount's first offering so lackluster. First, this three-disc set includes only half the first season - 12 of 25 episodes. Second, the only bonuses are the brief promo spots that ran the week preceding an episode. Third, and worst, is the absence of all three pilot movies. The first pilot, featuring an entirely different crew was previously issued on VHS, but is now out of print. Pilots #2 and #3, the latter being the lead-in to the series, are unavailable through commercial sources.

After such a long wait it's disappointing to get only half of the first season, to have it priced at $50+ per season, to get no extras (no making-of, no contemporary interviews, no photo gallery, no production ephemera), and to have the pilot movies omitted. It's great to have the first dozen episodes in hand, but Paramount's presentation isn't the first-class cruise it should be. 5-stars for the original episodes, 2-stars for the low-budget package.

Wow, the Love Boat finally washed ashore onto DVD.

I am ticked like everyone else is that it is only 12 episode (half of the full 24 first season episodes) I am upset that NONE of  the THREE Love Boat pre-series TV movies are included on this DVD. I am upset that there is no reunion special extra on DVD that most first season DVDs have(DVD like McHale's Navy, Growing Pains, Family Ties had them) . Also there is NO cast commentaries on any episodes. OKAY, that the bad news

Come Aboard, we're expecting you....

This Saturday evening stample of 1980's is a cute and corny show for family fun. The show was NEVER five star classical acting that would win any Emmys, just popcorn fun...that why its rated 4 stars, even now on DVD!  The reason Love Boat was a staple for eight seasons was the simple storytelling with a family like crew. It had guess stars who you knew from other TV shows and were familar with. It was a formula for entertainment, but it works!

The Love Boat soon will be making another run....

One can hope the rest of season one will arrive soon. I still enjoyed the shows on this 12 episode DVD...I would have liked like everyone else had expressed and  wanted a full season, but that is what the DVD  makers are doing these days. Charging more money for less product, it is the nature of business

Welcome Aboard, It's LOVE, LOVE, LOVE

It is well worth  to have a show where there is NO foul language...No car chases..No heavy duty issues..and a family can sit and enjoy this kind of television TOGETHER. There are not many things you can enjoy together these days. Love will never go out of style.

Hmmm.  Anthology series.  Not quite like ""American Style"", a little on the soft side.  Rotating characters?  No.  Cruise Ship.  Flirty employees.  Wide open ocean.  A million stories.  Do you think CBS will go for it?

Well.  We could use co-stars from the CBS shows.  Two or three short stories wrapped into a single show.  Do you think the regulars could build romances too?

Nope.  But they could play match maker every now and then.

Let's give it a shot!

If it didn't go like that, then perhaps it should have.  ""The Love Boat"" started in 1977, the same year Spiderman, Mash, and Happy Days were on TV screens everywhere.  The concept struck a chord, and stayed on the seas for 9 years until 1986.  Based on the novel of the same name, it is as fresh as it was the first time around.

The ensemble cast of the show included Gavin McLeod as Captain Stubing, Bernie Kopell as Doc, Fred Grandy as Gopher, Ted Lange as the bartender, and Lauren Tewes as the Cruise Director.  As a TV show, it is also memorable for the list of co-stars to grace the decks.  Meredith Baxter Birney, Suzanne Somers, Jacylyn Smith, Robert Reed, Loretta Switt, Milton Berle, Bill Bixby, Charo, Jim Nabors, Ray Bolger, Steve Allen, Gary Burghoff, Phil Silvers, Leslie Nielsen, Arte Johnson, and so many more appeared in cruise ship vignettes.  Charming to a fault, if the plot of one of the Pacific Princess threads didn't get you, the scenery would.

Paramount/CBS/Spelling TV have set us on a journey across the world.  Perhaps this is the impetus for a NEW Love Boat?  There's always room on the TV schedule for a good anthology series.
