8513591,3,B007ATHNMC,"Elvira's take on the old ""women amok"" sub-genre that has seen various revivals over the decades (juvenile delinquents, jungle women, women in power etc.) is the subject of these four episodes of the 2010 revival of Elvira's Movie Macabre. Although I've been her fan since the eighties (my parents let me watch her show, bless their hearts), these might be some of the worst episodes she's ever done.

And it's NOT her fault!

Unfortunately, the films presented here largely SUCK and have little, if any, replay value. ""Untamed Women"" isn't terrible, but it lacks any stand out performance or work that other films of its type have. ""Hercules and the Captive Women"" lands near the bottom of the peplum barrel and ""the Wild Women of Wongo"" is plain insufferable. The only relief is Corman's schlocky yet tightly made ""The Wasp Woman"", which is worth a watch.

Elvira tries to make things entertaining; unfortunately, with movies this bad, a host can only do so much. Worth it for Elvira fans but that's it.",1407542400,2,1004,4.825581395348837
8513592,5,B007ATHNMC,This Elvira DVD includes 4 witty and fabulous episodes of Movie Macabre including two never before seen shows The Wasp Women and Hercules And the Captive women which is so bad that it is actually funny. So if your a fan of the girl with the curves that will raddle your nerves pick up this DVD set for yourself!,1398038400,3,311,4.288135593220339
8513593,5,B007ATHNMC,"Elvira is a hoot, as always.  I wish she had more funny comments during each movie.  Maybe someday she could do a pop-up video version of these movies with more funny commentary to enjoy.",1383350400,2,187,4.470588235294118
8513594,5,B007ATHNMC,"You can't help but love the Combination of Elvira Mistress of the Dark and the greatest 'B"" films out there. This is fun for all ages. There is a reason Elvira is still around and its not just the twins =o) Recommended for All.",1352419200,6,227,4.181818181818182
8513595,5,B007ATHNMC,"I was a big Elvira fan from the beging of Movie Macabre, and I had a great time watching these movies. It was a killer blast from the past. I would reccomend it to any vintage movie fan. It was deliverd fast and in excellent shape, and will be ordering more from this seller.

8513597,5,B007ATHNMC,This is an enjoyable set of four episodes of Movie Macabre. The amazing thing is that the Hercules and the Captive Women episode uses a 16:9 widescreen print of the film. The weird thing is that the surrounding Elvira segments are done 4:3. Very strange.,1340582400,10,254,4.666666666666667
8513598,4,B007ATHNMC,This is the revival of Elvira's Movie Macabre that ran on THiS network. You might not have seen it since in my area it ran at in the wee hours on Monday morning. Elvira still has it as horror hostess. This set includes the episdoes Untamed Women and Hercules and the Captive Women. There are also two episodes that didn't air on THiS: The Wild Women of Wongo and The Wasp Woman.,1336348800,26,378,4.263888888888889
