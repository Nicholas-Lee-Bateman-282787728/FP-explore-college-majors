8493578,5,B0065S59SO,Great adaptive yoga program.  My students love it. You can use this program in its entirety or for individual skills.,1383436800,,117,4.85
8493579,2,B0065S59SO,"I was disappointed with this DVD.  I've taught yoga for years and am a certified yoga teacher and certainly found Mis Flynn's personal postures and formatting of class to be appropriate, but the lack of energy and interaction with the students felt rather stiff and impersonal.  I found very little that made this DVD helpful to deal with the uniqueness of her students or mine.  There just wasn't much that showed any joy or sense of discovery in the students or in the class as a whole.",1362960000,,488,4.586206896551724
8493580,5,B0065S59SO,"This video abounds with good information, gentle yet effective yoga poses and great heart. A step-by-step approach to breathing, chanting and postures makes the practice  easy to follow. The teacher exudes the kind of warmth that encourages confidence; the results of which are clearly demonstrated in her students. What a rich addition this program is to the lives of children with developmental challenges. By the way, it's a video for everyone else too!",1340323200,2,456,5.2465753424657535
8493581,5,B0065S59SO,"I purchased Yoga for Children with Developmental Challenges approximately 1 month ago. I wanted  something new I could enjoy with my  daughter who has Down Syndrome. I cannot express how happy I am with this purchase. It turns out the entire family is involved and participating in our yoga time! The postures and their benefits are so clearly explain by Mary Flynn. The setting and students are REAL students. It is clear to see that Mary Flynn is an experienced, highly-qualified educator with special education students.  My daughter, as well as my other children, have quality time together enjoying the wonderful benefits of yoga. The video moves at a pace that allows my daughter to stay focused and involved.  After the 40 minute class instruction on the dvd, our family is very relaxed.
I talked with my daughter's teacher about this video and I was excited to hear the school is  purchasing the Teacher's Edition to be used by their teachers at all different levels. After researching the benefits of yoga for special needs children I checked out this DVD on peacefulpathwaysyoga.com. There I was able to get a really clear idea of what I could expect to see on the DVD.
Anyone who has a child with special needs knows the value of having quality time that can include everyone in the family. This DVD provides wonderful instruction for a yoga beginner and for students of all levels and ages.  Bottom line... Easy to follow,affordable,educational,relaxing,and well worth the money.  I am a VERY VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER",1326240000,5,1528,4.9221789883268485
