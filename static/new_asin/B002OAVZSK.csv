8502112,1,B002OAVZSK,"This video consists of 7 short videos strung together end-to-end. There is no index so consequently no way to watch just one of them without watching all of them. Most are black&white, very little color. Overall, a very poorly done video. Not worth the price at just 50 minutes long.

A far superior video on the  Southern Pacific Daylight is DAYLIGHT, THE MOST BEAUTIFUL TRAIN IN THE WORLD which is 65 minutes long, lots of color train shots, has an index, and is extremely well done with great narration and lots of interviews, and at a reasonable price!",1391558400,,556,4.663265306122449
