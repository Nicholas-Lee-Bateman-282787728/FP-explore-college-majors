8276532,5,B001AB21LY,"Poignant, funny, and starring two remarkable child actors, this film centers around the experience of two Chinese immigrant children as they try to resolve the problem of evil using their familial Buddhist and neighborhood Catholic doctrines along with a hearty infusion of imagination. Eve and Karena respond to a run of family tragedy and arrive at different conclusions about what to believe. Priceless footage of Jesus and Buddha dancing.",1384128000,,442,5.420289855072464

8276536,5,B001AB21LY,"One of the most beautiful films i have seen. Looks at cultures and the impact of the dominant culture on other cultures. Weaves a narrative around that influence with tender compassion and understanding. Shows the impact of culture on a child's sensitive world. Shows how children work hard to make sense of the world around them.
Must see. You will not be disappointed.",1256601600,,370,4.888888888888889
8276537,4,B001AB21LY,"The ""editorial review"" does not do Eve and the Fire Horse justice because, as is too often the case on the info that appears on DVD cases, the ""product description"" is far from accurate. In my opinion, this film won its numerous prizes because it shows in a moving way how hard it is to grow up, how even more difficult it is to grow up in a family in America or Canada, or any country really, when the family still retains strong ties to a different culture. In this case, the immigrant family happens to be of Chinese origin. It is too simplistic to consider this rich story as another depiction of assimilation. Julia Kwan's brilliant story allows us to view all this with the added emphasis on how these two young girls try to understand their need for faith in their lives. The family is not a ""wayward"" family. It happens to be of Chinese origin and their old Buddhist traditions are what both parents and the grandmother solely believed until the children weave together what the mother accepts with hope ""It is better to have two Gods to be safe."" As the children struggle to understand, their new convictions about Christianity are important to both. Yes, the family experiences many changes as all families and relationships that are meaningful do. The touching aspect of how their love holds them together even to the youngest exuberant one is what makes this film so lovely.",1233619200,12,1386,4.638211382113822
8276538,4,B001AB21LY,"In my view, one of the wonders of Nature is the child actor.  Having raised two of my own, the idea that a child will accept direction is novel enough.  That children can respond, showing dazzling talent doing so, is little short of miraculous.  Julia Kwan's ability to maneuver the two children of this film bespeaks either superior talents, or theirs.  Likely both.  A stunning film exercise, with disturbing questions asked throughout, this is a fine example of the innovative filmmaker's art.

The story tells of a Chinese family, not yet a generation as immigrants in Vancouver.  The matriarch is a kindly Grandma, who clearly dotes on the younger daughter, Eve.  The older sister, Karena, remains distant, but the two sisters enjoy each other's company, as the opening scenes convey.  Buddhist and Confucian traditions are a major element in all their lives, but the outside world looms increasingly close.  The almost stereotypical example is the family's communication in the house, with the girls directing comments in English to the parents, who respond in Chinese.  Kwan is meticulous in handling that first cross-cultural inroad.  The girls, of course, attend an English speaking school, not a Chinese-language one.

A crisis, prompted by May Lin's (the children's mother) cutting down an apple tree, arises with the death of Grandma, which prompts questions of what happens in the afterlife.  In Buddhist tradition, the dead may reappear on the seventh day, and sure enough, Grandma is seen by Eve, but by nobody else in the family.  Reincarnation, a fundamental facet of Asian societies, leads Eve's mother, played by the stunning Vivian Wu, to bring Eve a goldfish.  The manifestation of Grandma in the fish will be hilarious to a Western audience, but has serious meaning for Eve.  Such inhabited bodies are avatars, and properly treated, protect their ""owners"".  Eve, as will be seen, needs all the protection she can get.

Karena, feeling a stronger need to assimilate into Western society, enters the Roman Catholic Church, dragging a reluctant and confused Eve in with her.  The training is intense, of course, with all other gods simply dismissed out of hand.  Karena buys into this fully, while Eve remains unconvinced.  And why not, since she's the one who has seen how it works?  The inevitable crisis occurs, however.  Karena, as is all too common with converts has come to reject all her traditions, refuses to honour the ancestral gods.  Eve cannot comprehend the unassailable fixity of Karena's new outlook, but cannot reject her sister.  The situation leads to a bizarre set of scenes - Karena's bathtub baptism of Eve is a white-knuckle episode, but events resolve themselves in the finale.

This is not always an easy film to watch, but the techniques of scene-setting as manifestations of the cultural conflicts are captivating.  May-lin, the mother, as confused as much as Eve about the Jesus myth, decides to simply add him to her panoply of gods and goddess figures.  The result of this decision is the visual high point of the film!  A gripping story, exquisitely depicted, give this film your attention.  It deserves it.
