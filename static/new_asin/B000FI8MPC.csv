2566048,4,B000FI8MPC,"I didn't see this series when it was originally aired ... and I am so thankful for the DVD release! The premise is that Ellen is an ex-dotcom exec whose corporation has gone belly-up. She decides to move back to her hometown, the dot-on-the-map ""Clark,"" where she is in for a real culture shock, as she adjusts to life as a guidance counselor at her old high school, as well as living with her mom and younger sister -- who cannot begin to comprehend some of the big-city ways Ellen has picked up in L.A.

The great thing about Ellen is that in every series or show in which she appears, there's a familiar feeling that always brings joy. You don't get the feeling that she's trying to be hip, or play up a role more than necessary. There's always that, for lack of a better term, ""Ellen element"" that is predictable in the most surprising ways.

The show's heart comes from the hilarious ignorance of the small-town characters (marvelously portrayed by the likes of Kerri Kenney, Jim Gaffigan, and others) and Ellen's attempts to interact effectively with them. Though the first two episodes are a bit slow, the plotlines get funnier and better-paced after that. There are some hysterical moments. For instance, in the episode ""Vanity Hair,"" Pam (Kenney) cuts Ellen's hair, as does a dog groomer -- unbeknownst to Ellen. The dialogue in the process, as well as the results, will leave you out of control!

Also worth definite mention are Cloris Leachman in her role as Ellen's mom, and Emily Rutherford as Ellen's younger sister. They play their roles in a way that is not generically stereotyped, rather, zesty and unique.

I recommend this DVD set to any Ellen fans, as well as any who appreciate down-to-earth situation comedy!",1152921600,32,1731,4.7218543046357615

2566060,2,B000FI8MPC,"Pretty mediocre 2nd output from Ellen. There are some fun supporting characters (the woman who plays Ellen's sister steals every scene she's in), but others, like Martin Mull and Jim Gaffigan, fall very flat, and even Cloris Leachman is given a character that really isn't in her wheelhouse (the daffy mom).

Amazing cameos from amazing stars, Betty White, Mary Tyler Moore, THOMAS LENNON!!! and Kerri Kenny-Silver as Pam (Kerri Kenny Made the show, I think it would be hilarious to write to Ellen Degeneres asking what it was like to be in the same room as Kerri Kenny, cause Ellen is so much more famous, shed open the letter thinking that I would gush about her, but nope, I wanna gush about someone she worked with 12 years ago)

Both disks were perfect! Not a single scratch.",1400198400,,621,4.495575221238938
2566078,3,B000FI8MPC,"I always thought Ellen DeGeneres was hilarious when I first saw her stand up routine on HBO years ago. Parts of it I can recall to this day. When she decided to take on television with a series we watched and enjoyed that as well. And then she redefined what she wanted to do with that series. Rather than be funny it became about her being a lesbian. That was important the first episode she did it on but it soon wore thin when each week we were having her tell someone else about it. It suddenly was more agenda oriented and less funny. It wasn't long after that the show folded too much controversy. The fact is the ratings weren't there.

Then in 2001 Ellen came back with a new series on a new network with a new story. Sure she was a lesbian again, but it wasn't the focus of the show. It didn't matter. What mattered was being funny and yes, she was funny again. Unfortunately the series didn't bring back the viewers she had lost and it only lasted one season. But for fans you can watch it now on DVD at an affordable price from Mill Creek, just $9.98 (amazon.com price).

Here she plays Ellen Richmond, back home in the small town she grew up in which is throwing a celebration in her honor as the most successful person to have left there. Ellen has owned several businesses and has one of the biggest dot.com businesses going. Until it collapses and she goes bankrupt...just as she is about to attend the dinner in her honor for being successful.

From their the series has her visiting with her friends and returning home to start her life again. She lives with her eccentric mother (Cloris Leachman) and ditzy sister Catherine (Emily Rutherford), a woman who seems intent of picking the worst possible candidates for boyfriends. The man who brought her home for the celebration is her old school teacher Mr. Munn (Martin Mull), now the principal of the school. Her ex-prom date Rusty (Jim Gaffigan) still thinks he might have a chance of winning her hand, even though she's informed him of her sexual preference.

Even though things look bad, Ellen lands on her feet. Mr. Munn offers her a counseling position at the school and she ends up having people to talk and give advice to. This is where Ellen's talent lies, in the back and forth conversations she has with people. It feels like it stems from her stand up routines in spots and is actually pretty funny. And while one running joke about being a lesbian keeps popping up (the ladies gym teacher might be the only other lesbian in town), it never becomes the focus of the series. Sure she mentions it now and then but each time the story continues from there rather than dwell on the topic.

I have no idea why the series didn't do better. Perhaps it was the competition it was up against. Maybe people were afraid it would be exactly the same as her previous show. In any event it was funny and perhaps better than a number of comedies we see on the air right now. But it didn't last long and for fans the only way to remember it is by picking up this DVD set now. Fans did eventually come to accept Ellen for herself and stop judging her. Her talk show first aired in 2003 and continues successfully to this day and she hosted the most recent Oscars. Ellen was and is a funny comedienne. This set is proof that she was a funny comedic actress as well.",1394150400,,3325,4.4
2566079,5,B000FI8MPC,I didn't even know this was a show until I watched.  I have watched her ELLEN reruns on FX and she was EXCELLENT.  A woman before her time.  In todays TV she would be a major hit.  Too bad people were so judgemental in the 90's.,1388620800,,228,3.891304347826087
2566080,5,B000FI8MPC,"This was such a great show, and it is a shame it did not last longer.  The cast was amazing, with Martin Mull and Cloris Leachman, and the others who came together to make a very entertaining and quirky program.  Most every episode was hysterically funny and very well written.  Too bad Ellen's popularity had not yet reached the heights of today.  I am sure it would have been a very longrunning and successful show.  It is nice to be able to see it again now on DVD though.",1383955200,3,475,4.292134831460674
2566081,5,B000FI8MPC,"Great DVD. As always, Ellen really is a riot and she didn't disappoint me this time.  Packaging was very good.",1381190400,,110,4.5

  Thanks",1366329600,,166,4.821428571428571
2566083,4,B000FI8MPC,I totally bought this by mistake. I thought it was her original Ellen show. I didn't know this show even existed. Never saw it or heard of it when it aired. Glad I got it. It was pretty funny. There's a young Kaley Cuoco (The Big Bang Theory) in one of the episodes.,1356825600,,266,4.037735849056604
2566084,4,B000FI8MPC,"I have been a fan of Ellen since I was a kid, literally.  I remember first seeing her on a show where she portrayed a secretary, but I can't remember the name of that show.  From that time, I have always enjoyed her stand-up, talk-show, and hugely successful and historical program, ""Ellen.""  I've read her books and even have a signed copy of Finding Nemo.  That being said, I had NEVER heard of this program, ""The Ellen Show.""  I was skeptical, especially after reading some reviews, but felt confident when I read that the standard Ellen comedy found its way into this show.  I'm glad I made the decision to buy - it's funny (a bit corny and predictable at times, but cute, warm, and fuzzy) - filled with a star-studded cast and several notable guest appearances (including Mary Tyler Moore!).  Although not as funny as ""Ellen,"" this show is entertaining, not a disappointment, and has a nostalgic 'early 2000's' feel.",1327968000,,921,4.683229813664596
2566085,5,B000FI8MPC,"This was a great series. I was exremely disappointed when it was cancelled after only one season. As good as ""Ellen"" was, I think ""The Ellen Show"" was actually better. Her interaction with her mother and sister was great, and the butch gym teacher was one of the all-time funniest characters in sitcom history. Buy it and you will not be disappointed.",1319241600,,351,4.67741935483871
2566086,4,B000FI8MPC,"This was a great, short lived series that offers hysterical situational comedy. If you are a fan of Ellen, Cloris Leachman or Martin Mull, you shouldn't miss this. Also great apperances by Betty White and Mary Tyler Moore among others.",1297468800,,235,4.9
2566087,4,B000FI8MPC,"Here's another show (along with ""Bette"" and ""What About Joan"") which I'm still surprised didn't have a longer shelf-life.  THE ELLEN SHOW was Ellen DeGeneres' followup to her ""Ellen"" sitcom (which folded in 1998 after it's fifth season when DeGeneres controversially came out both on the show and in real life).  DeGeneres wisely avoided the trap which brought the axe down on her previous show, and established her character in THE ELLEN SHOW as gay right from the start, thereby getting the issue out of the way to focus on the stories at hand--of which very few focus on the character's sexuality.

In THE ELLEN SHOW, DeGeneres plays Ellen Richmond, a dot.com company owner who files for Chapter 11, and is forced to move back to her hometown of Clark.  There, she finds her mother Dot (Cloris Leachman), crazier than ever, has kept her room exactly as she left it--anticipating the very day that Ellen would return home in precisely these circumstances!  Ellen's man-crazy younger sister Catherine (Emily Rutherford) works at the pharmacy/coffee shop, and her former highschool boyfriend Rusty Carnouk (Jim Gaffigan) has a job at the...erm, highschool.

With nothing else to fall back on, Ellen applies for the position of guidance counsellor at her old highschool.  A true fish-out-of-water, Ellen tries sharing and applying her ""big city"" life experiences with her new colleagues, only for everything to always end in disaster!

Due to poor ratings, THE ELLEN SHOW was canned after only one season.  Watching the series again on DVD I'm struck by how strong and terribly sharp the writing was.  It's a fantastic series!  Cloris Leachman is hilarious as Ellen's mother--and Ms Leachman has been extremely discerning in recent years about the TV shows she commits herself to on a permanent basis--so it must have been good enough for her to sign the dotted line.  Emily Rutherford (whom many would recognise as one of Jack's main acting students in ""Will & Grace"") is wonderfully goofy as Catherine.  Martin Mull co-stars as highschool principal Mr. Munn--a role not too dissimilar from the one he filled in ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"".

2566088,4,B000FI8MPC,"So, I bought this and was really excited to watch Ellen with Martin Mull, and Jimmy G. Long story short, I enjoyed the show, but not as much as her first series.  I didn't really like Ellen's sister.

But it is entertaining.",1250121600,,224,4.309523809523809
2566089,5,B000FI8MPC,"I love this show - has had me laughing for days. Cloris Leachman is hilarious throughout the series. Best episode is ""Vanity Hair"" - check out the bow and hair.

2566090,5,B000FI8MPC,LOVE LOVE LOVE Ellen DeGeneres!  This is a great 1st season of her 2nd sitcom.  Chloris Leachman is hysterical as her mother too!!!  As always Martin Mull is great as the principal of her old school.  Ellen has certainly answered her calling as a comedian and entertainer.,1244851200,,272,4.723404255319149
2566091,5,B000FI8MPC,This series was very entertaining and was hilarious as Ellen lead a life of a bookstore owner with zany friends and situations.,1232323200,,127,4.818181818181818
2566092,5,B000FI8MPC,"This is by far the funniest DVD we've seen in a long time.  It got a little annoying hearing the theme song so much but overall, we loved it.",1231718400,,141,3.8620689655172415
2566093,4,B000FI8MPC,I enjoyed this show.  Ellen and cast were just hitting their stride when this show was cancelled. A lot of famous faces show up throughout show.  Still a quick and enjoyable watching experience.  Actually got my husband to sit down and watch something with me.,1225584000,,260,4.733333333333333
2566094,3,B000FI8MPC,"I am only through disc 1 in watching these, and I never saw the show while it was on the air. I am a fan of the original Ellen series, and of Ellen's talk show, so I thought it would be logical to get this as well. The story is fun and as always Ellen is very funny. I watched most of disc one in a straight (hehe) shot and after a couple of episodes I found myself a little bored but nevertheless I am going to finish watching the series.",1224115200,3,439,3.8351648351648353
2566095,5,B000FI8MPC,"What a great DVD this is to have in your collection! ""The Ellen Show"" is fun, smart, sincere, sweet and often downright hysterical. Back in 2006 I bought this, but somehow didn't open it until recently and boy, am I glad I did...it helped me get through a bad cold...it was the perfect medicine!!

Sometimes all you need to see is that ""I know something you don't"" twinkle in Ellen's eyes and you just start to laugh. The woman has talent, there's no doubt about that and it can be seen in almost every episode found on two discs.

Some of the best ones include the pilot where Ellen returns to her hometown after her dot com business goes bust and finds a quirky bunch of people, both in her family and her co-workers. These folks have no concept there's a whole world to be found outside the small town of Clark. It's this mindset, of course, that helps fuel the humor of the show.

Other terrific titles on the first disc include: ""Walden Pond"" (Ellen becomes Clark's high school guidance counselor and bonds with a troubled student)...""Vanity Fair"" (contains a cute mix-up involving beauty salons and animal hairstylists...gives new meaning to ""best in show"")...""Missing the Bus"" (I'm a bit biased here since I love Betty White, but still it's a super episode AND with a young Dakota Fanning who steals your heart as a young Ellen in flashback).

A strong supporting cast carries ""The Ellen Show"" far above the bad treatment it received from its own network (how a tv program like this got cancelled when ""Yes, Dear"" went on to have four seasons is beyond me!)

The lovable, if terribly misguided set of co-workers are played to comedic charm by the ever-reliable Martin Mull (""Mr Munn""), the surprisingly gifted Kerri Kenney (as ""Pam"" the awkward, but ultimately kind home ec teacher), the adorable Jim Gaffigan (who is more than suited for the role of teacher-of-all-trades ""Rusty"") and the much-loved Cloris Leachman (who is just wonderful and endearingly daff as Ellen's mom.)

The second disc is not to be missed either. ""Ellen's First Christmas"" offers us the delightful Mary Tyler Moore (just as much an influence on Ellen DeGeneres as Lucille Ball, I imagine)...""Just the Duck"" captures the dilemmas singles face living in a small town and serves up some very bright moments of humor when Ellen attempts to dine alone at a fancy restaurant and finds plenty of patronizing pity on her plate...""Shallow Gal"" speaks to all of us who weren't quite right with in the ""in"" crowd back in high school and secretly want a second chance (guest star Maureen McCormick couldn't have been better cast...I mean, it's ""Marcia"" we're talking about)...""Where the Sun Doesn't Shine""  gives us a strong Cloris Leachman performance and proof that she has never lost her timing or her shine when it comes to delivering a great line.

My only disappointment here is that there are no extras (can you imagine the interviews they could have done?) and that there isn't more to love. ""The Ellen Show"" is a reminder that we need to save the sitcom before it dies for good.",1189641600,3,3058,4.756603773584906
2566096,5,B000FI8MPC,"We really loved the older Ellen series so while this show isn't as good, it's definitely worth the cost of the series on DVD. It's nice to see a ""new"" (to us) series - we didn't see it when it aired. We travel with a portable DVD player and it's nice to have something like this to watch that's in manageable sizes (unlike a movie).  I give it a thumbs up - if you're an Ellen fan.",1173484800,,381,3.948051948051948

2566098,5,B000FI8MPC,"I like this show a bit more than Ellen's earlier hit show (where she famously came out); Cloris Leachman is very funny, sort of an abrupt version of Carol Brady, if you will.  Her sister is also very, very good, Jim Gaffigan is not bad, and Martin Mull is essentially reprising the character he played on Roseanne.

Ellen is very subtle at times, but I think that's funnier than what you find in most ""joke"" oriented sitcoms.  Lots of good observational humor, and Ellen DeGeneres is very likeable throughout.  This is one that the audience never caught up with.

The Editorial Review dismisses the show because it didn't do well in the ratings, as if there's never been a wonderful show that didn't do well in the ratings!  CBS buried this show on Friday nights, and preempted it more than once, so it never had a chance.  The ""standup comedian with his/her own show"" window was closing--hardly Ellen DeGeneres' fault.  This is a smart show, and Carol Leifer who worked on ""Seinfeld"" and had her own show (Alright Already) is co-creator, so you know it's going to have quality writing.  That's the key.

I'm a comedy connoisseur, and believe me this is a smart comedy--along the lines of Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, The Bob Newhart Show, Barney Miller, Cheers, early Seinfeld, etc.  Check it out.",1156464000,26,1302,4.691629955947136
2566099,5,B000FI8MPC,"I remember watching this show when it was originally aired (oh-so-briefly) and thinking that although I was glad to see Ellen back on TV, it wasn't nearly as good or hilarious as her first sitcom.  After purchasing and re-watching the series on DVD, I can see that it definitely holds its own.  Ellen is the comical Ellen that we all know and love...and the storylines and jokes definitely suit her.  For anyone who loves ""Ellen"" and/or ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" I highly recommend catching ""The Ellen Show"" as well.  You won't be disappointed.",1154390400,13,546,4.838709677419355
