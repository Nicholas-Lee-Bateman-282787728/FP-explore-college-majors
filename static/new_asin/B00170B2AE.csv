BTW, see the NEW Trabi at [...] . I will be the first one on my block to have one of those.",1253145600,,330,3.925373134328358

8264332,5,B00170B2AE,"EXCELLENT DVD!!!  I love the Trabi, my parents had one, it was sooo easy to repair yourself and parts were readily available for very very low prices.  It is indeed sad that just because the Trabi was made in East Germany, people in the West badmouthed such an affordable car with soo much personality!  The story of the Trabant should be discussed much more!  Wish they would build many more...  I highly value this DVD!  EXCELLENT!!!!",1234569600,,436,4.671052631578948
8264333,5,B00170B2AE,"For those out there that are interested in this particular car, this is one of two must have video's to learn about its history, and to see some vintage footage.  English narration with subtitles during interviews!",1230076800,,214,4.944444444444445
