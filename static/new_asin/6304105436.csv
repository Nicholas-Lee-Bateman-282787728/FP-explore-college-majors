My teacher could not have chosen a better movie to depict this time period.  Bravo! and many thanks to teachers who show this.,930096000,2,274,4.333333333333333

790013,5,6304105436,"During 1861-1864 in the U.S. Civil War, Union Soldiers who were Prisoners were sent to the Confederate Prison in Andersonville, Georgia.  It is estimated that thousands of prisoners were held in overwhelming numbers for the facility.  and over 2,000 prisoners died from illness.  Today, the graves at the cemetery there bear witness to this inhumane tragedy.  The Prison was discovered after the fall of Atlanta, during U.S. General Sherman's march to the sea.  There was one stream that ran through the prison, and Confederate Prison Guards were upstream who used the water for bathing, a latrine, while animals drinking, dropping manure or leaving urine in the water.  For drinking water, the captured Union Soldiers wringed rainwater from their clothes or drippings.  There were roving, thieving union gangs called Raiders and secret tunnels unknown to Prison Guards.
Haunting scenes of conflict and inhumanity included young Southern boys just starting puberty who were Prison Guards (just as ruthless as the Hitler Jugend under the Nazi SS in WW II Germany and the trial that brought the Raiders to justice.  The Prison Commandant, Captain Wirz, was
even severely criticized by some of his own Southern Military Commanders  for not using Parole or Prisoner Exchanges to correct the deplorable conditions.  Ironically, Wirz did have moments of humaneness, when he informed the Union Authorities that the Prison was no place for young pre-adolescent boys (not in puberty) and arranged for them to be paroled, and escorted North under a White Flag of Truce to Union Soldier lines.  Several boys were saved from certain death.  Captain Wirz was Swiss (or German?) in nationality.

During the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued the famous ""Lieber Code"" - a rule book for Union Forces in Battle.  The Lieber Code stated:
""the unarmed person is to be spared in person, property and honor as much as the exigencies of war will admit.""  This was applied to both civilians and prisoners.  Violations of the ""Lieber Code"" under the command of Captain Wirz were cited that led to his Union military court martial conviction and execution.  As proof the United States had a long history to take precautions to avoid harming civilians and prisoners during and after armed combat, the ""Lieber"" Code was cited during the famous International War Crimes Trials at Nuremberg, during the 1940s.

True, this movie is not a documentary and there is ""Hollywood"" influences.  Nevertheless the master moviemaker John Frankenheimer directed this movie that enables any person with a basic grade school education to grasp the epic message of life inside the most notorious of the American Civil War's prison camps.  Well done, and worthy of an Emmy and several 5 Gold Star Ratings!  Evil is irrational and I will never understand how Americans abused or killed Americans during the Civil War.

One thing that struck us is the camp commander came across as a terrible, awful, little man in the movie but there is a monument to him erected in Andersonville for standing his ground and refusing to lie in order to protect himself. On a side note: if you ever go to Andersonville, make sure to visit the Bugle Boy Museum.

There is some history and as always in War movies Hollywood makes you will find atrocities not expected but very intense. I hear a lot about Libby prison and never knew the about Andersonville.

790052,5,6304105436,"A very well directed and edited film telling the viewer the story, dramatically, of a very embarrassing era in American History.  We all need to see this film.  Because it was a critical historical time in the formation of modern America, and it shows just how badly humans can act or maybe more accurately, not act, toward each other and ignore their conscience because of blind adherence to war time objectives and overarching philosophical principle of where the country needed to be heading.  This is not going to make you feel all fluffy and light hearted, folks.  But as I stated, we all need to see and FEEL what this movie projects, because we take for granted that life is all fine and dandy and we neglect our own history.  It is not for making us feel bad or guilty, it is to make us be mindful of how badly we can behave toward each other as a society moving in a given philosophical pathway.  I love this director, and to some extent I give him more deference than perhaps I should, but if you are looking for a film that will open a window for you into the Civl War in a way you haven't had before, you want to see this and maybe keep it around your home as I have for over 20 years now (I had it on VHS as well).",1454457600,,1227,4.2

I cannot watch it often, but I do watch it at least once a year.  It truly was a horrible prison camp with inhumane treatment of prisoners.  I wish watching this were enough to stop war as we are reminded of man's inhumanity to his fellow man.  Sadly, it is not.",1448409600,,453,4.113636363636363

The conditions were deplorable, the guards just turned a blind eye to whatever atrocities the overbearing inmates did to the others,and the so called sanitary amenities were non existent.
 The actors in this movie all deserved awards for the way they showed just what went on in that prison.
  This film showed that whether North or South,( I am sure) prisoners were NOT treated properly by the guards and the officers in charge on both sides didn't care about the prisoners, as this is also proven in books written about the same.

790405,5,6304105436,"I first learned about the Confederate Prisoner of War prison in Andersonville,Georgia when I read the book ""Andersonville"" by MacKinley Kanter .It was first published in 1955 and I read it shortly after that. This movie in 1996 tells the same story and is excellent.
 This prison was opened in 1864 and lasted until the end of the Civil War in 1865. The Confederates opened it up to house Union soldiers who had been captured.
 At the time it was opened,the South were already starting to lose the war. Resources were becoming desperate for the South. They were having great difficulty in getting food and supplies for their own soldiers;and there was virtually nothing for prisoners of war. The prison simply consisted of swampland,with a small creek running through it that was used for waste disposal,drinking water bathing and washing clothes. Thus it was polluted and contributed to the disease and death of the prisoners. There were no buildings,beds clothing or hardly any food  provided. The was a fence surrounding the area,armed guards,shot and killed all prisoners that tried to cross lines near the fence. The prisoners were simply left to fend for themselves. In summer, the heat was terrible and the winter brought freezing conditions. During the time the prison was in operation,33,000soldiers were held there and nearly 14,000 died. Gangs were formed amongst the prisoners that preyed on them. One particularly bad gang ,The Raiderswas particularly cruel,stealing from and even killing fellow prisoners.,Other prisoners actually got permission from the prison commandant to hold a trial and convicted 6 of the leaders of the Raiders and sentenced them to hang,and carried out the sentence.
  It appears that both the book and this movie are pretty factual.
 The character that will stand out to you will be Captain Wirz the camp Commandant. He is a complete anomaly,being not a Southerner,but from Switzerland. He had hopes of becoming a General,but got put aside to run the camp. He was totally crazed.;and in the end he was the only officer in the Confederate Army to be convicted and hung for crimes against humanity.
 Today the site of the prison is a National Park outside Andersonville,Georgia.",1394582400,2,2216,5.088154269972452

You can almost hear the cries and the canon fire when you are in these places. I have also read up on the subject and I have found that the north had prisons just as bad as Andersonville. You have to remember that the Union Army had cut off all supplies to the south. Capt. Wirtz was only in command of the prison for a couple of months, and there was not much that he could do to change what the former commander had done. He was hanged and I feel he was a scapegoat.

790721,5,6304105436,"This movie is perhaps the best account ever made on what prison life was like for more than the 40,000 Yankee enlisted soldiers who were imprisoned at Andersonville Prison in southwest Georgia from 1864 to 1865, 13,000 of which died in captivity from starvation, brutal treatment, disease, and even savage beatings inflicted by the criminal minds of their own side that had been thrown into the draft.
Up until then, Yankees and Confederates mostly just had temporary camps to hold prisoners for as little as a few weeks before they would be exchanged. But by the spring of 1864, newly-promoted General-in-Chief Grant decided to stop exchanges for good, therefore holding tens of thousands of prisoners in camps on both sides. The Yankee prisoners would starve because the Confederate nation of almost a dozen Southern states, threatened on all sides by marauding Yankee armies, didn't have enough food and supplies to feed their own civilian population and armies, much less tens of thousands of Yankee prisoners. This I can truly understand. If any food was to be available, it would preferably go off to their own families and soldiers, and the POW's would get whatever was left, which wasn't very much.
This movie follows the story of what appears to be about a company of Massachusetts troops who were captured during a skirmish with the other side on June 1, 1864 near Cold Harbor, Virginia, right before the slaughter of almost 7,000 Yankees was to happen on that ground within the next few days. You see the officers being separated from the enlisted men, and the officers were to be taken to Libby Prison in Richmond, the infamous camp for all Yankee officers in captivity. Upon their arrival at Andersonville, the men meet Captain Wirz, the Swiss-born Confederate commander of the prison who almost lost his arm at the 1862 battle of Fair Oaks. Wirz would end up being the only Confederate soldier executed for ""war crimes"" a few months after the war finally ended. He gives brutal treatment to the Yankees that attempt to escape from prison, many of which on record happened to do successfully, and this treatment brings much protest from a visiting Confederate colonel from the War Department. In the prison, a fellow soldier from their regiment that had been presumed dead since Antietam gives the arrivals great advice: Don't drink the diseased water from the spring, stay away from the Yankee Raiders that manage to rob the new arrivals of anything they have, and collect rainwater by wringing out their clothes during a downpour. Soon, the brutal treatment by the Raiders brings the whole camp into an uproar, and as the Confederate guards watch with fascination, the entire camp gives the Raiders some much-needed justice, followed by a trial and execution.
The Yankees also adapt themselves to building escape tunnels under the camp, helped by a couple of former miners from Pennsylvania, and you find out what happens to the ""tunnel traitor"" Yankees who hope to give this information to the Confederate guards for as little as an extra piece of bread. The prison life looks very harsh and you see many of the prisoners die, but it was simply a way of life for survival for those that lived.

790722,5,6304105436,"Throughout references and movies/TV shows pertaining to the Civil War, the name 'Andersonville' keeps cropping up, always with a negative connotation. There was good reason.
This portrayal of what happened inside Andersonville will raise your indignation and leave you thinking about other POW instances in our past and present.  'Andersonville' shows us a side of ourselves that we might not want to see or imagine; whether we would become a raider or one of their victims; whether we would stand by and let our own comrades in arms become victims of greed and violence or would we make a stand, possibly at the expense of our own life.
How so few could intimidate so many for so long is difficult to believe, but it does happen ... and it did.
Andersonville is a graphic portrayal of POW conditions during the Civil War [or as is said down here 'The War of Northern Aggression']. Ted Turner's people have done an excellent job in bringing to life a segment of war no one wants to see - the horrid conditions: lack of sanitation, housing, medical assistance, food and clothing. Man's inhumanity to man at its worst is vividly portrayed here primarily through the eyes of one Union soldier.

Unlike most others, it does not focus on the battles, the politics or the leaders. It does exhibit the cruelty, bravery and dignity of people in the most inhumane circumstances. Civil War prisons, especially in the South, were notoriuosly over crowded, unsanitary, filthy, and repressive leaving little hope for survival. Thousands of prisoners died of disease and those who survived were generally near starvation. In spite of all the adversity, this movie depicts the never dying spirit of the human soul. The strong faith and spirit of these prisioners coupled with their unwavering will to live is portrayed through the eyes of a Massuchusetts Regiment captured at Cold Harbor.

790833,5,6304105436,"'Andersonville' is a really fine film made about the infamous prison camps. It has a group of characters that the viewer can identify with and also contains very good acting. I think the twin story lines in the film are handled excellently. The storyline on trying to tunnel out of the prison is handled excellently and contains very interesting details on a operation of this kind. The other story line where the characters have to take on the camp bullies 'The Raiders' is also handled excellently by director John Frankenheimer. I find these scenes to be some of my favorite of the films because of the classic clash of good vs evil.

The film also does not sugarcoat the terrible conditions in the prison but I don't think the filmmakers blame it all on Wirz. What happened in Civil War prisons was truly awful and I really don't think excuses should be made by either side. There should have been something done by both sides to alleviate the horrible suffering of POWs from both sides.

Also, the film has a very authentic look and is very true to the actual layout of the Andersonville prison.

The DVD has good visuals and sound plus two interesting commentary tracks.

I would recommend viewers to visit Andersonville National Historic site in Georgia today. It is an excellent site, very well preserved and interpreted. The site has an excellent museum on all the POWs of America's wars. The cemetery is awe-inspiring, just as it is in the movie. I find it one of the most moving places in the entire United States. It is different than the battlefields. There is a sadness in the ground at Andersonville and if there are ghosts I truly think they are still at Andersonville. The site of Andersonville Prison is a place you will never forget.

Highly recommended!

I would also recommend reading the account of Andersonville contained in William Marvel's book 'Andersonville The Last Depot' that helps separate some of the fact and fiction that is presented in the film.",1262822400,,1980,4.75801749271137

History enthusiasts will fully enjoy- and made fully aware- of the powerful influence the Civil War still has on us 145 years later. As for myself, I was born in Elmira, N.Y., my dad's hometown. Elmira was a northern prison camp, and as horrible as Andersonville. I read a book on the Elmira camp, and it was in operation during 1864-65, the same time as Andersonville. I salute the gallant men who suffered and died, or barely survived, both camps. Ironically, the Elmira camp had formally been a Union training camp in 1861, when my own great great grandfather, age 17, entered as a Union private and fought, then severely wounded in McClellen's Peninsula Campaign in spring and summer of 1862.

790897,4,6304105436,"I have always been a fan of John Frankenheimer, and though his later efforts were not critically well-received, I believe it may be time for a reappraisal.  I suggest Andersonville as a starting point.

I watched this film twice, before watching it again with Frankenheimer's commentary.  It was like watching another movie.  Listening to John (sadly, now deceased) discuss these young actors, and how he set up some of the shots -- many involving thousands of extras -- I came to deeply respect both John and this film.

Bear in mind that they had only sixty days to shoot this, and on a limited budget (and they lost several canisters of completed film and had to reassemble the cast and rebuild the set 9 months later!), and you come away deeply impressed with the artistry and efforts of all involved, particularly the costume and makeup folks who worked on this picture.

As John says, this film is not about war, but more about man's willingness to endure anything to survive.  Several of the large-scene fight sequences are astonishing, as is the trial scene that vindicates and upholds the rule of law even in horrific conditions.

For me that is something that resonates and is instructive even today.",1236556800,2,1210,4.811594202898551

This movie in particular shows what the union soldiers went through in Andersonville.  It shows how they suffered and how they kept one light of hope to survive.  It reveals that not only where there dangers outside dealing with the Confederates but also from their own people, something history books doen't talk about.

790902,4,6304105436,"In the wake of the critical and commercial success of A Man For All Seasons, Fred Zinnemann unsuccessfully attempted to use his post-Oscar clout to make a film about the atrocities at the infamous Confederate Civil War prison camp where 12,912 Union prisoners of war died of starvation and disease, but as many others had found out before him, studio chiefs didn't think it was the sort of thing to reverse declining cinema attendance and pulled the plug before a frame was shot. There had been a small-scale early TV play about the post-war trial of the officer in charge but it wasn't until Ted Turner's success with Gettysburg that a full-scale dramatization of life inside the stockade made it to the screen, and then only on the small one. The biggest name on the credits of Andersonville is director John Frankenheimer, then going through something of a critical comeback returning to the medium that first brought him to prominence: the cast is good, but it's more a case of a few familiar faces rather than big stars - Frederic Forrest, Cliff de Young, William Sanderson, William H. Macey - among a cast largely made up of little-known actors. Yet it's very clear that a lot of money has been spent, and that it's been made on a truly epic scale. Rarely has the old copywriters' pitch `a cast of thousands' seemed more appropriate as almost every scene boasts swathes of re-enactors to fill out the overcrowded prison.

Despite being made for television it never looks threadbare and it never feels like its playing down the ugliness of the situation in the name of taste or network censorship even if it doesn't dwell on the details as much as it could. Built for 8000 but ending up housing 45,000, Andersonville itself was little more than a cattle pen: no barracks, a fetid stream, a lot of mud and far too many inmates surrounded by a wall and watchtowers, it didn't take much to turn it into a festering hellhole, with rations often withheld by the commander, water so rancid that inmates had to wring rainwater from their clothes to avoid fever, child guards daring prisoners to cross the `dead line' so they could kill them for a bounty and prisoners forming gangs to prey on and often kill each other. Even Confederate officials regarded it as `a disgrace to civilization.' In a war as ugly as the one between the States, it's some measure of how bad things were that the only man convicted and executed for war crimes in the entire Civil War was the commander of Andersonville.

As drama it's fairly straightforward, following a group of new arrivals through their first days in the camp to the time those few who survive leave, taking in many of the expected conventions of the prison movie en route - escape attempts, futile deaths, dashed hopes and a near-riot. At times it does threaten to turn into a Civil War version of a WW2 P.O.W. movie, but it's held back from the pitfalls of great escapism by the fact that where many of those films often naively showed German prison camps as virtual holiday camps where the inmates tried to escape almost as a game, Andersonville makes it clear that here attempting to escape is seen as the only alternative to dying in squalor and pain. While there are few surprises, it's executed with real conviction, Frankenheimer's superb direction complemented by excellent photography from Ric Waite and production design by Michael Z. Hanan. That said, it is annoying that Warners' DVD has been needlessly cropped from fullframe into 1.85:1 widescreen, a reverse cropping that is just as bad as panning-and-scanning widescreen films into fullframe. While most of the 167 minutes it's not too damaging, there are some close-ups that become way too tight at times, although it's generally only a momentary distraction.",1194912000,3,3772,4.792626728110599

As a film, however, this one is lacking in many ways, from hyper-melodramatic voice-overs to noticeably poor editing.  When combined with inaccurate history, the disappointment is doubled.  Andersonville was directed by John Frankenheimer, who created many good or great films, one of which, The Manchurian Candidate, is a masterpiece.  With his resume, I have to believe that the intentions of the movie-makers were good, but the end product (a made-for-TV movie) reflects an inferior medium.  A story as naturally powerful and important as Andersonville deserves a greater commitment to realism, and the drama should have been derived from historically accurate fact.

  Instead, the drama was manufactured--history was dramatized. It's a film that deserves to be made again, re-written by someone with a commitment to accuracy and produced by a company more interested in the best available version of the truth than in pandering to an audience of supposed dullards with second-rate pap.  When stories like Andersonville are not told with excellence, the fall into mediocrity is precipitous and leaves me feeling that the story should not have been filmed at all.",1153785600,7,1299,5.297560975609756

790988,5,6304105436,"After looking at some of the reviews, I'll admit I'm a bit confused.  I think this was made AFTER Gettysburg so any motivation of remorse couldn't have had much to do with ""Andersonville""....

As a younger Civil War/War of Northern Aggression student, I read MacKinlay Kantor's book ""Andersonville"" and while there is much vile to see in this film, it does show why the written word is still the most powerful weapon in war.  Kantor's descriptions in writing defy depiction by even the most skilled set-dresser.  And nobody, I mean nobody, Federal or Confederate, officer or enlisted man, young or old can come out a situation such as Andersonville looking particularly well--and the post-liberation photographs show it, just as do the post-liberation photographs of Auschwitz, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen.  The German film of the 1950s ""The Doctor of Stalingrad"" which purported to show conditions in a German POW camp in the Soviet Union after World War II, and the great film ""Hart's War"" depict relative Shangri-La conditions...

For someone who knows little about the POW situation during this great American conflict, I would recommend the DVD ""Andersonville"" but NOT in isolation.  It must be tempered with a rounded knowledge of conditions in Northern Camps--which DO appear on the History Channel regularly...and recognition that after prisoner exchange was discontinued, nothing short of genocide on a fairly grand scale could result.

I recall a television documentary about the trial of the Andersonville Commander, whic starred of all people William Shatner--back in the 1970s or so...which I was quite impressed with and should be resurrected.  But for the present, films such as ""Andersonville"" are replete with underlying messages about the horrors of war, that humans make war and then complain about the conditions which are inevitable, and that despite our intelligence we have not found an alternative to it--yet.  If this film inspires one intellect to put his or her head to the solution of this problem, then there will be no more Andersonvilles....This film shows how easily humans who are civilized (we think) can descend into the psychosocial dynamics of the crowd, the group, the herd, plundering and devaluing of human life to that of mere livestock.",1145664000,11,2276,5.228021978021978
790989,3,6304105436,"This is the story of the largest Confederate POW camp housing Union prisoners during the Civil War.  It is a tragic story of men placed in inhuman conditions where approximately one-third of them would perish.  There was little food, no clean water save rainwater, horrendous overcrowding, disease, crime, and brutality.  The German POW camps for allied prisoners had a far better survival rate than did Andersonville. (Not to be confused with the Nazi concentration camps.)

This story takes the position that while much blame for the terrible conditions was due to Southern shortages of food and supplies, a principal cause was sheer brutality of the Southern prison administration.  I do not know if this is true; some reviewers here state that such is not the case.  It is true that late in the Civil War both sides had a great deal of animus, particularly in the South since most of the war and devastation took place there.  Thus, it is plausible that bad feeling between guards and prisoners led to the abuse depicted here.

This is largely a tragic and downbeat story, with some moments of uplifting drama.  The camp is incredibly realistic; the viewer truly becomes transported into the horrendous conditions existing in the stockade.  Although there are no major actors in this film, the acting is nevertheless very good.  Overall, this is a powerful film but unfortunately a depressing one.",1135296000,6,1401,4.995689655172414

Therefore, the Raiders are not guilty of breaking any law"", ""these are desperate times and desperate measures are required to survive"", ""only rebel law applies in the prison"".  Outcries from other Union soldiers were heard, ""we suffered the same hardships and did not yield to survival tactics.  What about us?""  Prosecution deflected the rebel law argument by appealing to justice stating there were certain rights and protections guaranteed to all men: 1. protection against murder 2. protection against theft.  The military jury found the six Raider leader guilty and the punishment affixed as death by hanging.  The union soldiers lived by law and law made the men civilized.  Mob rule only works while the majority tolerates the theft;  however, once intolerance levels are hit,  a violent revolution transpires.  The raiders could not fight the majority and probably would have all been murdered with out a trial.  However, the majority gained their whit and requested and were granted a trial to prosecute the Raiders.

The ""Great Escape"" with McQueen probably took its plot from Andersonville.  The story line had a ton of similarities.

Andersonville has a fair share of violence.  At one point the directors portrays the prisoners as Zoombies, in the land, of the walking dead.  Scurvy symptoms increased the graphic repulsiveness, in an attempt to balance the audience sympathy, abhorrence of the injustices, and despair of the troops.  Heroism abounds, leaders reject traitorous offers to defect, form their regiment, about face, and march away from on looking Confederate Admiral making offer.  Factually, 45,000 men were imprisoned and about 13,000 died from starvation, disease, and crime.  Inhuman treatment of prisoner included lack of drinkable water, over crowding of the prisoners, no prisoner exchange, and looting.  Andersonville has a fairly high entertainment value, as a civil war movie.  The characters were passionate, compelling, and captivating.",1133740800,3,2038,5.426751592356688
790991,5,6304105436,"""Andersonville"" is an intense drama about a Civil War prison camp for captured Union soldiers.  The camp is a huge stockade, built for 20,000 prisoners of war, but is filled to overcrowding with over 35,000 Union POW's, and more arriving daily.  The conditions are horrible beyond words, virtually no food, no sanitation, clothing in rags and tatters, no shelter from the rain, gangs rampaging through the camp, rampant disease, a hundred men dying a day - a literal hell on earth.  Puported to be historical fact, the story centers on a brigade from Massachusetts and their struggle to survive, and what a horrendous struggle it is.  Other reviewers have stated that the story is not entirely truthful. Due to the shortage of critical supplies in the south, I do not doubt that the deporable conditions existed exactly as depicted in the movie. I cannot comment on other issues as I have not read the book that the movie is based on.  Truthful or not, the film is absolutely riveting! You will be shocked by the condition of the men, the violence in the camp, the slow agony of starvation, and the inevitable deline in the men, both physically and spiritually.

The film has no well-known ""star"" actors, but even so, the various actors perform marvelously.  Their characterizations are as real as if they were really in the camp and suffering unto death.

This film was an eye-opener for me, for I never considered the fate of Civil War POW's.  I will remember the conditions the men lived and died in for the rest of my life. I recommend it without reservation.

I do take issue with the idea that conditions at Andersonville were related to the southern war shortages.  This same excuse has been used to explain away the treatment of allied POWs by the Japanese and also the holocaust.  That part of Georgia had an abundance of corn and rice so there was no excuse for the starvation.

More than 12,000 Union soldiers died at Andersonville in the short time it was open. Most died from disease and the lack of food or the unsanitary conditions they were forced to live with. Many were even killed by some of their own. This movie is straight forward and direct. There are no great battles depicted, no great charges or heroes leading an attack. There is only the brutal reality of life in a Civil War prison. The movie takes you inside the walls and almost makes you one of the inmates as you get caught up in the harsh conditions and the inhumanity.

Henry Wirz is portrayed as the original nazi (he was a swiss immigrant), a shallow, sadistic man who had absolutely no concern about the wellfare of prisoners in his charge.  The fact is that the horrendous conditions at Andersonville (Camp Sumter) were the product of southern war shortages, not the product of a psychopath.  Moreover, the battle royal between the raiders and the regulators depicted in the film never happened.  In reality, Sgt. Key's (Limber Jim) regulators arrested the raiders with the help of the confederate guards and the courts-martial occurred at the insistance of Wirz, not the prisoners.  Finally, only 11 men are known to have been shot on the deadline.

All this might make for excellent film drama but, it is extremely poor history.  So, what is good about this film?

And the list just goes on and on.
The more that I learn about the Civil War the more amazed I become at how totally untrue many of the assumptions that I had about our most crucial conflict are.
To clarify.  It was economics and stupidity that had more of an impact on the conditions in many civil war prison camps be they Union or Confederate.  Particularly at Andersonville a better and seperate sewage system could have been set up.  The men were forced to drink from the same water source that was used for human waste.  And certain actions that may have been viewed as just acts of cruelty were in reality simple economic facts of life.  For example the Confederacy was economically devistated by the war.  They barely had enough food to feed their own troops let alone the thousands of prisoners.  Cruelty had little to do with that fact.
It should also be noted that conditions in many Union (northern) prison camps were just as deplorable.
I particularly appreciated how the indignation of the Union soldiers came out when they were informed that prisoner exchanges had ceased because the Confederacy would not treat black prisoners like white ones.  In short many Union soldiers had no great love for blacks just like their southern counterparts.
