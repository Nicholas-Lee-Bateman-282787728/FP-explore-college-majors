7921129,5,B00004RF37,"Really super series. I Could watch this over & over with a little delay in between. What's not to like??? So much to take in. And, reflects the way men & women interact at any place & any time, though all of it takes place in the beautiful English Countryside!",1367366400,,260,4.22
7921130,5,B00004RF37,I wish they would release again as a set. I had to buy Series 3 as it was not available in our library system. Peter Bowles is great deadpan comedian. Bryan Murray and Anna Manahan were indispensable to the series as well. Worst part it was too short of a series. It could have continued for twice as many episodes. 18 episodes and out just got the characters well developed. We have Peter Bowles in Rumpole & To the Manor Born. All good comedy. The Irish RM is my favorite of his work.,1301616000,,486,4.236559139784946
7921131,5,B00004RF37,"Inside Series 3 is an episode called ""Friend Of Her Youth"" that features Maria the Irish Water Spaniel. She is not a good dog but she is a beloved dog.  If you are a dog lover, you will find this a very, very funny episode.  I am buying this today because I am wearing out the Library's copy of this episode.  I like all 3 series & recommend them highly.",1191715200,3,354,4.0285714285714285
7921132,5,B00004RF37,"Early work, Very dry humor, with long set-ups but well worth the wait. A real classic. The video showes it's age but the comedy is timeless.",1168646400,4,140,4.423076923076923
7921133,5,B00004RF37,"I just loved this series when it originally came out, however I had not seen all of the three series when they were originally shown on t.v. so when I saw it was available I was thrilled to be able to procure it even though Series 3 is only on VHS.

The acting is brilliant.  Peter Bowles as the English Resident Magistrate a perfect foil for the many wacky Irish characters.

I feel it has stood up well to the passage of and anyone who enjoys a clever British comedy series will certainly enjoy all three series.",1130371200,,514,4.278350515463917
7921134,5,B00004RF37,"A wonderful series, well worth the investment. It was great to be able to return to a show that we missed years ago. These days there is so much on broadcast and cable stations, but actually very little worth seeing. This series fills a large void.",1124150400,,248,4.413043478260869
7921135,5,B00004RF37,I have purchased Series 1 and 2 DVD. Now when are you going to release Series 3 in DVD. I have been waiting a long time and feel by now it should be in DVD. I am stuck without the final conclusion of the DVD Series. This program is so good I can't understand the delay.,1122163200,,269,3.8214285714285716
7921136,4,B00004RF37,"As a viewer who loved the first two seasons of this charming series, I was delighted to learn that the third and final season was at last available on videocassette.  The Irish R.M. 3 returns with most of its excellent cast  intact, with the exception of Doran Godwin, who played Philippa Yeates, the  wife of R. M. Major Sinclair Yeates.  While Philippa's warm presence and  delight in Irish unconventionality are missed--her absence is explained by  her going to tend a sick parent in England--the Major is not forced to  languish in lonely solitude at Shreelane House: his levelheaded sister,  Barbara (ably played by Sarah Badel) comes to look after him.  Although the  addition of Barbara to the mix does take some adjustment--on the part of  the viewers AND the characters--the transition is fairly smooth, especially  after Miss Yeates, like her brother,  falls under the spell of the Irish  locals.  A void that is somewhat more keenly felt and less satisfactorily  filled is that of Rosemary Anne Sisson, who scripted the entire first  season of the Irish R.M. and much of the second, as well.  Sisson has an  uncanny knack for making the necessary adaptations to her original source  material without sacrificing its integrity or authorial vision.  In her  capable hands, the Somerville and Ross stories retained all their humor and  zest, even as the onscreen perspectives expanded from that of one  character, Major Yeates, to those of several: Flurry Knox, Philippa, and  Sally Knox.  Sisson remains on board as Script Editor for the third season,  but, alas, pens none of the episodes herself.  Nonetheless, the writers of  the final six episodes do a capable job, even if a few of the installments  lack Sisson's sparkle.  The writers are aided, of course, by their talented  ensemble of English and Irish actors who, by now, are so at home in their  roles that they can elevate fairly standard material to remarkable heights.  Veteran cast members Peter Bowles--as dapper, kindhearted, often clueless  Major Yeates--and Bryan Murray--as the impish and irrepressible Flurry  Knox--are in fine fettle.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the  maturation of Lise-Ann McLaughlin's Sally Knox who, over the course of  three seasons, has evolved from mischievous girl to starry-eyed young bride  to strong-willed but affectionate wife and mother.  There is more attention  paid, in this season, to the marriage of Flurry and Sally Knox, which is a  welcome development. For two people who kiss exactly twice in the entire  series and never remove a stitch of clothing in their scenes together,  Flurry and Sally generate a remarkable amount of chemistry and convey the  impression of a loving, if occasionally contentious, marriage between  equals (or as equal as any marriage COULD be in the early 1900s!).The  various misadventures of Major Yeates and his friends include an attempt to  introduce high culture into the town of Skebawn, a possible haunting by a  family ghost, a foray into another county to hunt hares, and an ill-fated  sailing expedition that ultimately lands the waterlogged crew at the  doorstep of a private asylum inhabited  by rich eccentrics and a homicidal  cockatoo!  Overall, the tone is lighthearted, recalling the buoyancy of the  first season (the second ventured at times into more serious dramatic  territory). However, Irish R.M. 3 is the most autumnal of the series--a  pale, sepia-toned light bathes most of the exterior scenes and the  interactions between the characters have aged like a fine wine.  But if the  theme of the first season was the classic ""fish out of water,""  and that of the second involved putting down roots in Ireland, the third  season ultimately puts the tolerant ""understanding"" between Major  Yeates and his Irish neighbors to the test in a conclusion that makes all  parties examine the worth of their eight-year relationship more closely.  Highly recommended.",961545600,8,3934,5.121835443037975
