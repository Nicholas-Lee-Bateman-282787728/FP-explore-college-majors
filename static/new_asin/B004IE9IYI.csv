8430623,4,B004IE9IYI,"This movie is so funny. I love the all-star cast and I did not think it was going to be that funny. I took a risk and bought the DVD anyway because I like some of the actors, and I am glad I purchased this DVD. Now I have another great Hindi comedy to add to my collection.",1365984000,2,273,3.7241379310344827
8430624,1,B004IE9IYI,This movie is very lame. Comedy and acting is horrible. More shouting than sense. I do not see it as a funny movie at all.,1325980800,,122,3.92
8430625,3,B004IE9IYI,"NO PROBLEM is a laugh riot! It is funnier than Golmaal 3. I saw with my friendsand we could not stop laughing. The Comic Timing of actors like Sanjay Dutt, Anil Kapoor is impeccable, but the surprise packet was Sushmita sen who excelled in her scenes. Her scenes were simply HILARIOUS. The public is loving this film and it is going to be a blockbuster super hit. Go watch it with your family. Specially kids will love it.",1300579200,,422,4.423076923076923
