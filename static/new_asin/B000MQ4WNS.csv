2738383,5,B000MQ4WNS,I am thoroughly enjoying watching these.  I saw some of them back when they were on TV but not all of them.  Good clean detective shows.,1274918400,,136,4.1923076923076925
2738384,2,B000MQ4WNS,"Although I love this series, I was very angry after buying this volume 1 of season 1 to find out that there wasn't going to be a volume 2 of season 1. They created a complete set of season 1 instead. I will not be getting split seasons anymore unless the 2nd volume is already for sale. Otherwise, this was a great TV show and will buy more but complete seasons.",1202428800,15,362,4.112676056338028
2738385,5,B000MQ4WNS,"I have just watched a few of these episodes...and I want to alert my fellow DVD buyers that if they are fans of this show....the DVDs are very high quality. This show must have been shot on good film stock as the images are crisp, well saturated and excellent contrast. The guest stars are movie star quality and the stories are interesting..and well acted. Above all...Raymond Burr is a fascinating actor and as far as the small screen is/was concerned he had a commanding presence which is always compelling. I'd put these on a par with the columbo sets ...in story and strength of guest stars. If you are a fan you will not be dissapointed.",1173571200,26,643,4.551724137931035

2738397,5,B000MQ4WNS,"The episodes were great, but yalf of them were missing. I never like to buy two sets for one season. To me it shows greed on the part of the seller and I don't desire to support greed.  B. Ward",1456617600,,193,3.825

2738399,4,B000MQ4WNS,"Ironside - Season 1, Vol1 was a good video to watch, but I would have to have seen more episodes on the cd.",1453248000,,107,3.6956521739130435
2738400,5,B000MQ4WNS,"It was just.so. GREAT to.receive this outstanding. DVD of a favorite series.from.the past at such an affordable price. I just wish the rest of the series was.not so pricy.

2738402,5,B000MQ4WNS,"It may be just a short snippet of the 1st season, but for the money value I think it's a pretty good deal. It looks and plays well. I like the actors and the show itself. If you get what you pay for I think this 6 or 7 episode disc set it just that, a decent deal for what you pay for.",1431820800,,285,3.5396825396825395

In good shape.

2738414,3,B000MQ4WNS,"This title gives the impression you are getting more than you are. There is no volume 2 either so if you want the rest of season 1 after you buy this you will have to buy the entire first season release anyway. I bought this release because I had recently checked out the complete season 1 at the library and watched it so I wasn't desperate to buy the complete season release. I am a total maniac for the pilot episodes of old TV shows, and I was able to pick up this release with the pilot for practically nothing. It is a quality product as far as production goes, but a person would be better served to spend a little more and get the excellent Ironside complete first season.",1300492800,31,680,4.2384615384615385
2738415,4,B000MQ4WNS,"I give this a 4 star because my wife loves Raymond Burr, me not so much.  The vehicle that Ironsides transports himself to scenes if laughable by todays standsrd.

Also this series was right after the Civil Right Act and its just too heavy on making up to Black People and it just doesnt accomplish it.

Buy it used from a market seller its just not worth full price.",1288224000,2,367,4.2898550724637685

8170570,5,B000MQ4WNS,Fast delivery.  Had the full movie of Raymond Burr/Ironside when he got shot which is what I was wanting.  This movie shows him walking and then getting shot and his recovery.,1499817600,2,175,4.612903225806452

8170572,5,B000MQ4WNS,Raymond Burr was great as Perry Mason and did a superb job as the wheelchair bound Ironside.  Season 1 volume 1 was a great buy.  I'm glad I bought it.  The other volumes seem to pricey right now.,1475712000,,196,4.105263157894737
