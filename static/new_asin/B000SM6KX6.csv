8205840,5,B000SM6KX6,"Gee, I could have sworn I reviewed this awhile back.  The video arrived in a matter of days and in good shape, as well as in the seal wrap.  This video is just what I need for my tech college classes at night.  This video fits in well with the subject of the Industrial Revolution and the role played by railroad trains of the old west.  I'm looking forward to using it in my classes.  Thanks, B. Lineberry",1238371200,,406,4.153846153846154
