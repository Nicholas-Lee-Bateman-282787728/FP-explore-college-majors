4331933,5,B004DCM5RC,"Matlock is what a good show should be! So many TV shows today are just trash, but these shows are intelligent, heart-warming, and just plain entertaining.  I have all the previous seasons along with the sixth season, and the sixth season is no let down.  Season Six is many hours of great, family-friendly entertainment!",1296864000,16,320,4.907407407407407
4331934,5,B004DCM5RC,"I never ""review"" products before they're released, but I'm so glad that Matlock has not been ""frozen"" after only a couple seasons being released on DVD, like so many of the other older TV shows.  Matlock is released by Paramount, and Paramount is one of the worst offenders for stalling releases.  I own all the previous Matlock sets, and they are strictly no frills, episodes only, with no special features of any kind.  However, I have seen the syndicated versions of all the episodes so many times that I can tell that what you get on the DVDs is probably the original broadcast version, because there is some content that seems new to me now.  Matlock is pure enjoyment, and it definitely stands up to many repeated viewings.  I love putting in a Matlock DVD and choosing ""Play All.""  There are only a couple more seasons to go, so let's hope that we get the rest of them without having to wait for years.",1291161600,43,909,4.512195121951219

4331963,4,B004DCM5RC,"I like the show, but I could do with out the mild swearing and viewing bedroom scenes.

Plus many shows focus on infedility which doesn't make this much of a family show.

I know it is much better than current shows morality standards, but still.",1405468800,3,246,4.444444444444445

4331977,5,B004DCM5RC,"Possibly the best show is ""The Nightmare.""  Ben Matlock, Julie, Michelle, Conrad, and Lt. Brooks have taken a chartered bus to a dude ranch.  The bus breaks down in a western ghost town.  While standing in front of an old saloon, suddenly an overhead board comes loose, knocking Ben out - when he comes to, he's back in the old west.

Conrad McMasters (Ben's investigator) plays a cowboy seeking revenge on the sheriff for shooting his uncle.
Bob Brooks (police detective) plays the town drunk - he'll help Ben illustrate a key point during the trial.
Michelle Thomas (Ben's associate) plays a classy saloon girl - she'll tempt Ben in her crimson boudoir.
Julie March (prosecutor) plays a prissy boarding house owner - her brother was shot and she believes Conrad is guilty.

Other characters in season 6:
Les Calhoun (Don Knotts), Ben's neighbor, appears in 2 episodes.  In ""The Picture,"" Les is planning to get married.
Miss McCardle, (Ben's housekeeper), plays in 2 episodes.  No standout scenes.
Billy Lewis, Ben's old annoying acquaintance from his home town, holds a long standing grudge in ""The Witness Killings.""
Charlie Matlock, Ben's father, helps young Ben Matlock solve a murder in black & white flashbacks in ""The Dame.""
Leanne McIntyre, Ben's daughter, appears in ""The Assassination.""  After her husband left her, she felt a strong need to come home and reconnect with her dad, however, they grow apart when she decides to defend a judge that Ben detests.

Overall:  These shows are good enough to watch many times.
DVD - 2011.  Color & Contrast: good to excellent.  Sharpness: good.  Defects: 3 episodes have thin white lines at the top.  Sound: volume normal, clarity excellent.",1398556800,4,1694,4.960992907801418
4331978,1,B004DCM5RC,"Honky, slow, poorly acted, contrived, boring, etc.  This is probably the worst of these D.A./P.I.  series that I have ever seen.  Andy thinks that playing the pole of Mayberry sheriff is all he need to do - regardless of what role he is playing.  But without Don Knots, Andy's character is a stiff.

4332045,4,B004DCM5RC,My father has always LOVED Matlock. I've wanted to buy the entire collection to him since at least 1 year! But there's just 1 issue: this wonderful series doesn't have Spanish subtitles... It's kind of customary nowadays: every good DVD has this feature.
