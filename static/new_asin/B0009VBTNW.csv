2323993,5,B0009VBTNW,"The touching story of a spoiled girl, Katie, from an upper middle class family who finds out about a school project where a handful of students go to China to help in a hospital program involving some pretty disfigured kids going through surgeries.

The pictures that Katie sees upsets her (especially one girl in particular who shares her Birthday) and she decides to go with the group.
Throughout the movie, we also see glimpses of the chinese girl's life, which is very sad.

She was abandoned as an infant, and a worker found her, and raised her as his own.
His wife became outraged by this, and instead of HELPING the orphan girl,she become jealous of the attention the man gives her. He ends up raising her alone.

When the 2 girls from different worlds finally meet, it is very touching,and Katie gives the girl, (Li) the courage to go through with the operation.
This was just a very nice movie, one without sex and a lot of cussing,and unpleasant characters (except for the stepmom)
It was just one of those movies that restore your faith in mankind.
Very uplifting, and well acted, too.
Also, it was filmed on location in China, so there is a BEAUTIFUL backdrop to a wonderful story!!!!
I HIGHLY reccomend it!",1168387200,6,1219,4.6342592592592595

2323995,5,B0009VBTNW,"While this movie wasn't exactly a good movie, I think it is one of the best out there. It tells the story of a 17 year old spoilt or pampered girl from malibou(Katie), and a girl from rural chinese(Lindsey, or Lin), who shares Katie's birthday.  Lin was abonded at birth,due to a severe facial deformity, & is adopted by a worker that finds her.  Lin lives with her adoptive father, & his son & wife for seven years, until on Lin's 7th b'day, her dad loses his temper & throw's a cup at his son. The next day, The son & the wife leave. 10 years later, Katie is given an option to participate in a program called ""Doctors Gift""(based on real life org. Operation Smile)to get the points she needs to graduate.  She decides to go to China as a volunteer with this org. Whislt in China, she has a mental breakdown after she see's the deformities of some of the children.  With some help from her room mate, a surgeon, she soons finds the courage to keep going. The next day, she goes off to find Lin. She manage's to convince Lin of what her father wants her to do; Get surgery on her face. This is a very moving, touching story. I cried, because it shows all the hardships people have to put up with and how people reach out to help those people.",1147824000,6,1243,4.232067510548523
2323996,4,B0009VBTNW,"East meets west.  A Barbie doll born on the same day as a young Chinese girl inevitably crosses paths and makes a point so many superficial people would be well to heed.  It doesn't matter what you see at first; there is far more to people than anyone wants to believe, and their true beauty lies in more than appearances.  Lin was already a beautiful person, and Katie had to go to China to discover her own worth.

I cried because so many people think their lives are so crappy around me, but they never had to grow up living like so many of the children this movie exemplifies.  It is not the best movie in the world, but it brings home the valid point that western civilians feel way too sorry for themselves over absolutely nothing, and pretend they never saw things like this.  My only question is this: if you're looking for volunteers to help physically deformed children in a world that's already devoid of compassion on other levels, where do I sign up?",1138492800,5,963,4.443181818181818
2323997,3,B0009VBTNW,"SMILE is one of those Op-Ed moments on CNN that can be told with poignant dignity in 10 - 15 minutes and make a significant impact.  The trouble with SMILE, the motion picture, is that it stretches this idea into 107 padded minutes, incorporating far more sitcom TV dialog about wealthy families with strident children looking for ways to escape uninspiring parental role models with teenage sex life and outside causes.  It takes so long for this movie to get going that it loses the viewer.

The strong elements lie in the concept of the parallel of two girls born on the same day, one to the wealthy Malibu family with everything but concord, an the other left as an unwanted deserted orphan because of a facial deformity, salvaged by a caring worker who raises her as his own.  The stories run parallel through the teen years when the Western girl seeks meaning to life by joining a humanitarian medical group whose efforts are directed toward offering the Eastern girl a chance at a normal appearance.  The comparison of the lives of the two girls and their disparate families is tender and meaningful and that alone is worth the effort to tell this tale.

The actors are very good for the most part - Sean Astin in his most mature role to date, Mika Boorem as the Western girl and Yi Ding as the Eastern girl, and Beau Bridges and Luoyong Wang as the apposing fathers, Linda Hamilton as a rather tiresome mother, and some good young actors in supporting parts.  The cinematography in China is very lovely but there is little tie in with the California counterpart.  Jeffrey Kramer directs with less hold on pacing than on commitment to a worthwhile tale begging for brevity.  Grady Harp, October 05",1129075200,5,1704,4.653333333333333
2323998,3,B0009VBTNW,"So, I'm reading T. R. Holtzclaw ""Travis H.'s bile-spewing review below and I'm thinking, ""Kevin Dillon's character from 'Platoon' LIVED!!! ... and he just attacked 'Smile' with the butt of a shotgun!!""

While ""Smile"" is no one's idea of great cinema, it's hardly the utter waste Travis felt compelled to warn the planet about.  On the negative side, the pacing of the story, due to some ""Afternoon Special""-style editing, runs too long in many scenes.  It's this T.V. style of movie making that nearly robs this project of the impact it plainly is striving for.  A by-product of this is that the lead girl is a bit too successful in conveying teen self-centeredness at its most grating (a problem easily managed through some deft use of the remote), where a couple less scenes of this sort of exposition would've made the point while tightening up the movie nicely.  At least one reviewer below thinks Cheri Oteri brings too much SNL - for me, she brought just enough, if only because it raises the tempo of the movie from its lethargic stroll.  She tones down her wilder style, leaving the impression of some inspired improvising, and next to the other people on screen, her character is a splash of technicolor flitting around a field of sepia-tone.  She's just too close to some real humans I rely on for comic relief to be seen as anything but a plus for this flick.

For those in the audience learning Chinese, this has more than a smattering of clear Mandarin used to propel certain parts of the story.  That the Chinese father and daughter home-study their way to some fairly impressive english can be seen as either promoting the Asian stereotype of genetically pre-disposed brilliance ... or borderline laughably off the mark.

Where the movie succeeds, in particular the DVD rendering with its extras, is in the light it sheds on special projects that've been set up to provide kids around the globe with medical treatment for birth defects.  The final 1/5th of the movie seems to get the pacing and acting right (just in time!) to convey the strong emotional impact this kind of work can have on the patients and caregivers, alike.  As the story concludes and drifts into the final credits, the choice of music is also a particularly effective touch that continues to carry the tone of both melancholy and great relief that are at the heart of the real drama on which the movie is based.",1127606400,8,2398,4.724220623501199
2323999,4,B0009VBTNW,I must admit there were a few times during this film that the acting and scripting was a bit off... however taken as a whole it was good film for the family and also one that causes a moment of reflection on how too often people in modern society are too self-centered on only their own existence and take for granted the good things they have to be grateful for.,1126915200,10,363,4.2
2324000,4,B0009VBTNW,"Smiles is an uplifting movie. The cast is ok (Oteri has a lot of SNL in her, and gets a little annoying, but she's still a good soul)  The story is sweet and poignent and the setting is exotic. I especially like how it was shot in Shanghei, and how there's actual Manderin, instead of Chinese who all miraculously speaks English. A nice little movie that will make you smile.",1126051200,5,375,4.357142857142857
2324001,4,B0009VBTNW,"My first reaction on seeing the cast was to groan inside. Not wishing to prejudice my viwing beforehand I persisted and was pleasantly surprised by the result.

Be not mistaken, this is no earth shattering movie which will win artistic awards or even oscars.

It is a feelgood, tugging at the heart-strings movie aimed at Western and westernized audiences,

It tells the tale of two girls born on the same day an ocean apart who grow up leading very different lives. While for the girl of Malibu life is a breeze with comfort and success without struggle living in the parental home with two parents who fight and squabble but who nevertheless dote on their daughter, the other girl enjoys or endures a different experience. In China a girl is found abandoned with a facial disfigurement. She is discovered by a worker and taken home to be brought up alongside his wife and son. They leave after seven years when the husband resists his wife's demands to send the girl away. He selflessly devotes himself to her upbringing despite the difficulties while she hides herself away lierally in the house and by a veil when outside.

The two come together through a community service project which takes Miss Malibu to China. Each learns a little about life on the other side of the tracks and good wins through until they all live happily ever after.

Partly a propaganda movie the film plays on the emotions and we can all share in the pain and joy. We wonder what the disfigurement is until it is finally revealed near to the end of the movie. Despite this aspect to the movie it certainly had an impact on my children at home generating many questions about a whole gamut of areas. The scenes are touching and both my fifteen year old and eleven year old certainly got the moral of the story.

Good wholesome fun for the family and although it is more than a little bit corny at times and also ham-fisted with obvious parallels it pays it's way.

I don't normally recommend movies like this but on this accasion I am happy to do so for children of all ages.",1125792000,22,2055,4.5528455284552845
2324002,5,B0009VBTNW,Like this movie especially the father was an excellent actor,1443657600,,60,5.1
2324003,3,B0009VBTNW,"I was honestly hoping this movie wasn't as bad as I had heard. I bought it simply because Sean Astin was in it, and he was the only reason I even endured it. His character was one of the only enjoyable, likable and realistic characters in the film. The rest I either wanted to slap or was indifferent to.

Katie, the main character, was awful. She plays two boys off against each other, throws temper tantrums, orders her parents around and in the end gets exactly what she wants. I understand that at the end of the movie, she's learned a lesson. (What that lesson was I don't really know.) But it loses it's impact when the entire time she's treating people like crap, she's being told how wonderful she is.

Both of her ""boyfriends"" are just terrible. And the movie ends with no clarification between the characters, except that's she's back together with her borderline abusive boyfriend and her fling is with her best friend. And what was with her sex life? No, nothing happens. But what exactly was the purpose of us hearing about it, watching her almost give in, having her mother drill into her head that she ""must take birth control every day just in case!""  Or her parents marital problems? How did any of it add to the movie? I don't even see how any of it made sense to the plot, since almost NOTHING was resolved at the end of the film...

The parts in Shanghai were much better than Katie's story. But even so, some of the moments with the father are uncomfortable and just plain weird.

Like I said at the beginning, I bought this movie because of Sean Astin (and I LOVED his character - I wish he was my teacher!), but considering he's only in half the movie... Smile was an okay movie. But only okay. And only because of Astin and a handful of minor characters at the ""Doctor's Gift"" hospital.",1434672000,,1810,4.4397590361445785
2324004,5,B0009VBTNW,very great,1430524800,,10,4.5
2324005,5,B0009VBTNW,it was a very good movie,1426464000,,24,3.1666666666666665
2324006,4,B0009VBTNW,"""Smile"" is an independent film from 2005 about an American girl and a Chinese girl born on the same day. Kate (Mika Boorem) lives the good life as a typical Southern California good-lookin' blond whereas Lin (Yi Ding) was discarded like trash as an infant by her parents because of a facial deformity. Thankfully, a man rescues the girl and sacrifices all to see to it that she has a quality life (Luoyong Wang). The two girls meet when Kate decides to take part in a program encouraged by her teacher Mr. Matthews (Sean Astin). The story's a cumulative creation based on thousands of true stories, including one of an American teen and Chinese teen. A picture of the two is featured at the end.

The cinematography, locations, score/soundtrack, etc. are professional-level filmmaking and there are a few big names in the cast, like Linda Hamilton and Beau Bridges as Kate's parents, not to mention Astin. Although this is one of those tear-jerking inspirational dramas, it's also a coming-of-age flick. To be expected, the story goes back-and-forth between Kate and Lin. The latter's life is quite sad, except for her adoptive father, while the former's life plays out like the usual teenage-babe-in-high-school yarn. I don't mean that in a bad way because Kate's (melo)drama helps hook the viewer into the story and is one of the film's strengths. Another positive is that the filmmakers don't try to play your heart-strings too early. The whole story is a build-up to the revelation at the end and, I have to confess, it brought tears to both my wife and me.

Unfortunately, you can tell that this is a low-budget movie in regards to the weak acting in several scenes. When a movie has the funds the filmmakers will take several shots of the same scene until they get it just right; and they'll kick axx if they have to in order to get the best out of the actors. Here you can tell that they set up scenes and shot them very quickly with the attitude of ""That's good enough."" Why? Because time is money and they didn't have the money to take all day to shoot one or two scenes, so they got the best they could on their limited budget. Another negative is that the story is too by-the-numbers. You're watching a scene and it feels like actors following the contrived words of a script rather than what they would do or say in real life, which ruins the movie's illusion of reality. If you can ignore these flaws, however, this is a worthwhile inspirational drama. Being shot in China, it gives Westerners a good spotlight into the lives of common people in that country.

The film runs 107 minutes and was shot in Malibu, California, and Jingxi & Shanghai, China.

2324008,5,B0009VBTNW,"Wow,  what an incredibly touching story.  The premise of the sub-plot involves a group medical mission to China, somewhat along the lines of Doctors without Borders.  It's a different group, and there's no religion involved in this film.  It turns out the medical group welcomes volunteer students from High School honors classes to travel with them and they earn citizenship credits in school.  This leads to an opening sequence in the classroom where Sean Astin is the teacher, recruiting students.

The scenes which begin to tell the story in China are wholly gut wrenching.  If this weren't also a true story, we might lose interest when the teen-agers acting skills are occasionally a bit wooden.  But the adoptive father in China is incredibly noble, and long-suffering.  He risks everything to attempt delivering his adopted daughter to the care of the traveling physicians and the chance for her to experience a normal life of her own.

Break out the Kleenex box for this one.  The real life events which transpired took a highly circuitous route, almost making the happy ending seem impossible to attain.

2324025,3,B0009VBTNW,"This is basically a film promoting a non-profit called Doctor's Gift. They go to places (in the story, Shanghai) and donate their expertise as plastic and reconstructive surgeons to fix some major disfigured faces.

We have two stories running in parallel of two teenage girls who live a world apart in almost every sense, but share a birthday. There's Katie, a pretty blonde from Malibu, whose father is a psychiatrist and who has boys wrapped around her little finger. And there's Lin, in a small village near Shanghai, who was born with a major birth defect of her upper lip and gums. This is not just a harelip, but a more extreme distortion. She goes around wearing a blue veil heavy enough so no one can see through it, and in fact barely goes out of the house.

In Katie's senior year at Malibu High, her school included a requirement for some kind of public service, and Katie's teacher had experience with Doctor's Gift. One of the things they do is accept American students as volunteers, giving them a chance to contribute their time and gain some experience. Katie was apparently struck by the fact that the file her teacher gave her (Lin's) showed they had the same birthday.

It's a simple story, really, but a nice one. A rather spoiled young girl learns to care for someone other than herself. And a girl who was afraid to think of herself at all is transformed.",1336694400,,1378,4.616326530612245
