8180357,1,B000NOKJDQ,"My kid got this as a present, and I think someone thought this was the Neil DeGrasse Tyson ""Cosmos."" This is so much worse. There are way better Cosmos knock-off series out there, and I have a feeling this is just an attempt to re-market a series of cheap classroom videos as one of those. The copyright date is 2006, but the production quality makes it feel about ten years older.
Another notable feature is that they have a tendency borrow a lot of idioms from Genesis. The Big Bang through the formation of the Earth is covered in relatively short time in the first episode, and is couched in a lot of ""weasel"" phrases like ""some scientists believe,"" and other phrasing that makes it seem like conjecture and guesswork. There was definitely a mention that not all scientists agree. Not *inaccurate,* but somewhat misleading, and definitely a ""hedge."" The name of the production company is ""Creation Films Documentaries,"" which mainly produces military documentaries, and one is left wondering if this is intended for a Conservative audience so they can watch science documentaries that leave room for religious worldviews.",1488585600,,1125,4.957671957671957

8180359,4,B000NOKJDQ,"This documentary gives an awesome breakdown of the solar system, our galaxy and the over all universe. Though it is now a little outdated with some of its information, it is still amazingly up to date.",1358812800,,201,4.611111111111111
8180360,1,B000NOKJDQ,"I'm really interested in astronomy, so I picked this up one day. I wish I had gotten something else instead though, because this is terrible. I can't even watch a single DVD (there are 5) in one sitting because it is literally so boring that it puts me to sleep. The narrator's voice is extremely dull, the guy(s) they interview are dull, the graphics and pictures are ""meh"" at best, and the music is fairly soothing; which is a great combination to have you snoring within 20 minutes of putting this in.

So, if you are having trouble sleeping at night, I would highly recommend getting this. However, since I bought this to try to learn more about astronomy, and not be bored out of my mind, I can't recommend it for that.",1308441600,2,724,4.443609022556391
8180361,2,B000NOKJDQ,"I was expecting something informative and entertaining; unfortunately, I got neither. Most of the information was either boring and appropriate for a grade school audience or not explained adequately or properly. The visuals and writing are also extremely poor. I love astronomy and learning, I found this DVD to be very juvenile. My spouse likes fun interesting facts and thought the DVD was boring. Hence, I would not really recommend this for anyone...maybe little kids interested in science...not sure how entertaining they would find it though.",1262649600,3,549,5.395348837209302
8180362,1,B000NOKJDQ,"I thought it was made in the 70s until I heard references to the mid to late nineties! The production quality is so poor, it seems at least 30 years older than it is. At times, the film shook, like a broken VHS tape. Don't let the tin casing, and free copy of Marooned fool you. This is a terrible item and a true waste of money. The subject material also is very rudimentary, but helpful for young children or school classrooms. Production quality is distracting though...",1261872000,4,473,4.448275862068965
8180363,4,B000NOKJDQ,This is a nice primer for the neophyte astronomer.  Don't think the graphics and sound are as bad as the other reviewer.,1215216000,2,120,4.454545454545454
8180364,1,B000NOKJDQ,"I'm a science DVD junkie, but I couldn't even finish watching this garbage.  This video has truly state-of-the-art visuals--or at least, it would if it had been released in 1972 instead of 2007.  I've seen local car-dealership commercials with higher production values.  And I'm pretty sure that the narrator was actively trying to bore me.  I wish I had just spent the money on another episode of NOVA.",1205625600,7,403,4.882352941176471
