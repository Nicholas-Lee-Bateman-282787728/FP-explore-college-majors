4460178,5,B004RA7XWM,Bought this for Heartbreak Hotel and Indian Summer.  Both are light fun shows for a Saturday afternoon with friends.,1425600000,,116,5.105263157894737
4460179,1,B004RA7XWM,"I have only watched Indian Summer so far since buying this DVD, but the quality is horrible.  I feel like I bought a bootleg copy.  I expected more from buying direct from Amazon. The picture and sound quality are horrible.  I don't recommend buying this DVD set at all.",1419897600,,270,4.469387755102041

4460183,5,B004RA7XWM,I like all three of these movies and it's nice to get them all on one disk.  It also helps me save space.,1393286400,,105,3.5652173913043477
4460184,4,B004RA7XWM,1 good movie and 1 solid movie plus a ehh movie. Combo pack movies are always a good buy because you never know hwat you will discover.,1385683200,,135,4.037037037037037
4460185,1,B004RA7XWM,"This 3 DVD set is not worth buying or even watching. While the original films were entertaining they have been transferred to disk in a way that renders the colors unrealistic and produces a letter-box effect on all four sides reducing the screen size significantly. I bought this set to save money but what is on the 3 disks is barely watchable. You don't get any special features for any of the movies. Just play and scene selection. To add insult to injury, the disks broke loose in transit and rattled around inside the case scratching each disk significantly. Bottom line, spend your money elsewhere.",1314230400,14,605,4.771428571428571

8438842,5,B004RA7XWM,"Wonderful movie set. Packaging was fine and shipped quick. I bought this mainly for ""Indian Summer"" it's a great film.
Overall I am very happy with my purchase!",1481932800,,160,4.75
8438843,4,B004RA7XWM,My gf and I love watching hard to find or forgotten movies. Bought this for the ski genre. Haven't watched the rest.,1480291200,,116,4.318181818181818
8438844,5,B004RA7XWM,great collection,1469404800,,16,7.5
8438845,5,B004RA7XWM,"Great pack for the value.  Indian Summer is one of my faves; I used to watch it with my sister when we were kids.  The cast is wonderful, especially Alan Arkin, who is one of my favorite actors, and it is very funny without being cheesy.  I haven't watched the other movies yet, but I remember Heartbreak Hotel from when I was young, and it was also really funny.  Good little-known movies.",1466899200,,390,4.375
8438846,4,B004RA7XWM,"In all honesty, I bought this three pack just to get Heartbreak Hotel. Indian Summer looks interesting as well, and I will get to it eventually. Not many people remember Heartbreak Hotel, and if they do, it may not be fondly. A movie studio thought Charlie Schlatter was going to be a movie star and cast him as the lead. They were wrong. Someone also though David Keith would make a respectable Elvis. Also inaccurate. Finally, the plot - to kidnap Elvis Presley to make his mom stop drinking and carousing with bad men - is beyond ludicrous. And yet, I like it. Go figure.",1455580800,,574,4.476190476190476

8438848,4,B004RA7XWM,"Liked Indian Summer best, reminded me of big chill. Aspen was a disappointment. Acting was only adequate. Scenery was gorgeous. Heartbreak hotel is a good flick for a drive in movie in house with your sweetie and lots of popcorn.",1426204800,,229,4.75
8438849,3,B004RA7XWM,"The only movie in this DVD that I enjoyed was Aspen Extreme and it was the reason I bought it, so I can't complain.",1426032000,,115,3.8333333333333335
