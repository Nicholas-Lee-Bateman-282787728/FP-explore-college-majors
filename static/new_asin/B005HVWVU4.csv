4706793,5,B005HVWVU4,Shuffle is one of my favorite animes so its natural for me to give this product a high rating...highly recommended!,1344211200,,115,4.8
4706794,5,B005HVWVU4,"I have been very impressed with a number of anime series I have seen lately (Kanon, Love Hina, Chobits, K-On!, Strike Witches, Angel Beats, Clannad and especially Ah! My Goddess!), but Shuffle! rates up there with the best of them! It is lovable, heart-warming, cute, sad at times, funny (with mostly embarrassing humour involving underwear!) and just leaves you wanting more. It has some fanservice (panty shots etc.,) but not too much.

The story follows 17 year old student Rin Tsuchimi, who lives with friend Kaede Fuyou and her father (who is almost always away on business) since the death 8 years earlier of both his parents and her mother in the same car crash. They are like brother and sister, and Kaede loves looking after Rin, whom she is secretly in love with. They are both in the same class at high school, along with friends Lisianthus, aka Sia, Nerine (also known as Rina), Asa Shigure (who is known by her tendency to slap Rin hard on the back in greeting, much to his chagrin), Mayumi Thyme, who is noted for her flat chest, although she is very pretty; she is very self-conscious about this, and not unknown for beating to a pulp any male who comments on the fact! Also part of the story are pretty youngster Primula (known as Rimu, or Rimu-chan), who turns up looking for her 'big sis' Nerine, and Eustoma and Forbesii, the fathers of Sia and Nerine, who both regularly embarrass the daylights out of their respective daughters, Sia particularly tending to get violent and hit her dad over the head with a chair when that happens! Last of the girls is Kareha, who has a tendency to sigh and go gooey-eyed whenever she sees anything she thinks is 'cute'! The only other male character in the proceedings is Rin's friend Itsuki Midoriba, who is an idiot, and tries to get the girls to go out with him using the most preposterous methods, which always fail. Only once in the entire series does he have anything wise or worthwhile to say. Last of all is their home-room teacher Nadeshiko Benibara, who is single, very attractive, and totally fed up with most men's attempts to pick her up (in one episode she confides in one of the girls, saying to her 'Where are all the good guys? They are mostly already taken, and I get left with the idiots!).

The actual storyline comes down to the fact that most of the girls (who are all gorgeous, and mostly kind and intelligent) are in love with Rin, who is a kind, caring guy, and known for going out of his way to help anyone, often to his own hurt. Each of them wants to 'land' him, and he dates each of them over time. The backgrounds (some of which are extremely sad and heartbreaking) of each are covered in flashback, and the resulting events vary from cute, funny and awkward to very painful. I won't say any more in case I spoil things, but suffice it to say I was totally riveted from beginning to end; I'm just sorry it finished! You totally get to feel like you know and love these guys; I felt a real wrench when it was over, but it is a lovely story, and the feelings it stirred in me stayed with me for ages. You must see this!",1335398400,20,3102,4.449912126537786
4706795,5,B005HVWVU4,This is one of my top favorite romance animes with its twist and turns but it sticks to the storyline and plot it doesnt venture off really except a little towards the end but nothing bad Shuffle what you would suspect out of a romance harem anime its keeps you interested has tramatic parts interesting character development its well done and i highly recomend this anime to romance or harem genre anime fans or just anyone what it out of the blue its worth the watch.,1334880000,,469,4.465116279069767
4706796,5,B005HVWVU4,I thought ut was a great anime the animation was great the music was great the characters were aswome and funny I loved them all the only thing I dident like was the choice he made in the end but still one of my favorite,1334361600,,220,3.911111111111111
4706797,5,B005HVWVU4,"This is another series that teaches lessons by following the lives of it's characters as they live thru their daily lives. I was reminded of ""Kanon"" by the way demons and gods were presented as a device to highlight the girls personalities. The heros pick toward the end sort of surprised me at first but then I saw it was right on. This is a good anime to watch and I recommend it.",1329350400,,382,4.2465753424657535
4706798,5,B005HVWVU4,this is a really good series about a young man choosing the girl he loves with alot of crazy stuff happening. This is a must have anime series. Parents buying this for their kid it has sexual suggestions in it aswell as breif nudity.,1328918400,,233,4.318181818181818
4706799,5,B005HVWVU4,"Ten years ago the portals of heaven and the gates of the abyss open, releasing their hosts.  But they are not here with swords and armor, no they are here with suitcases and cameras.  Welcome to your new neighborhood where humans, gods (who have elf ears), and demons (their ears look like Ryoko of Tenchii fame) all live in peace.  Hoever for Rin, who is the target of a group of people because he lives with the most desirable girl in girl (Kaede) known as the KKK (knights to kiss Kaede, not the ones in hoods), does not care.  But when two transfer students arrive things get interesting.  Not only are they the daughters of the Kings for gods (Sia)and demons (Nerine), but both say they are engaged to Rin.  Then add to the fact that they are his neighbors really throws things loopy, as the fathers try to force Rin to choose between them.  Add another cute demoness (Naru) and his childhood friend (Aya), can Rin actually make a decision on who he loves, or will he go mad in the process.

I bought all the disks when they first came out and this is one of my favorite shows.  It is more adult (light to mid Ecchii (partial nudity, topless scenes, panty shots galore)) then most harem comedies, but it does have a very good story which needed the full 24 episodes.  The characters are well developed and well liked, and each one has a story and a dark secret that when you watch it compells you to keep watching (especially Naru and Kaede's).  When you get to the end, there is no plot lines hanging, but it did leave an opening that could bring out a new season or series (though after all these years it might not happen), but of course the end choice could have you yelling at Rin.  Buy it and add it to your collection, you will not be disappointed.",1328313600,22,1760,4.348623853211009
4706800,5,B005HVWVU4,"Here we have an anime about Rin, who is a less than stellar student that one day ends up getting the god and demon kings daughters in love with him, and they want him to choose one of them to marry.  What follows is a typical anime story about a guy all of a sudden having a bunch of girls liking him, but turns into a bunch of crazy events at the end.

While the main story is about the girl the main character has to choose in the end, it's also about the side adventures they get into. A lot of the characters in this series have more than meets the eye quality to them, and it's fun to try and figure out what's going on with each of them.

The animation is nicely drawn with attention paid to their surroundings, and it's kind of cool to see the types of ears ""Demons"" and ""Gods"" have. I like the detail they gave to each character; it really shows off their personality. The music fits the anime well, and I like it.

This is another Anime that Netflix provided streamers to watch, and while its average at the start, the crazy plot twists and the choices the main character makes at the end make this well worth watching. If you don't watch it on Netflix it's usually pretty cheap and would be a nice addition to any Anime collection. It also ends on a great note.

~  Written: January, 2012

Positive:
* Nicely done animation
* Crazy later half
* Good ending
* Lots of back-story to the main characters.
Negative:
* Some people may not like his choice at the end",1326758400,14,1470,4.191489361702128

4706825,5,B005HVWVU4,"Rin Tsuchimi has a problem.... He has too many girls trying to gain his attention, and affection.....

This sounds like every other Harem on the market, with panty shots, bouncing boobs, and slapstick comedy right......? Even the name sounds comical..... And if that is where your mind is at...YOU WOULD BE DEAD WRONG....! While there is some comic relief, embarrassing moments, panties, and even a few moments of nudity.... this show is all about raw emotion.... I don't think any other anime has ever pulled my emotional strings in every direction like this one did.... Happiness, sadness, pain, suffering, love, jealousy, rage, warmth, affection, almost every feeling a human can have is pulled out of watching this series..... The subtlety at times, and shear jerking force in others, at which it is done is the part that hit me hardest.....I even teared up a little..... As the story progresses, and secrets are revealed, the characters show immense development in their natures, and begin to understand where their true feelings are...... I was absolutely floored by the plot twist ending, but also relieved...as so many stories of this type end without closure.....And while the door may be shut, it is not locked and therefore could be re-opened at any time..... My only regrets.. I did not watch this sooner... and I can only give it 5 stars.... This is a MUST watch.... But if you are a somewhat emotional creature like me.... be warned...this one will get you.....",1457568000,2,1475,4.97165991902834

4706835,5,B005HVWVU4,"I was pleasantly surprised at this anime. Ive known about it for some time but i thought of it super fanserviced up but far from it. This also being my first romance anime purchase, definitely out my comfort zone of purchasing animes. I love the idea of gods and demons living among us and those kings being friends and looking for sutures for their daughters. I enjoyed the laughs aswell. The end of the series totally caught me off guard which increased my intrest in this particular series. I would definitely reccommend this series. As for the fanservice comes by, it's not every episode and in your face, it's definitely subtle in ways. There's upskirt shots, bare skin some times. If fanservice is your only intrest this might not be for you. As far as romance goes definitely pretty good.",1433203200,2,795,4.685714285714286

4706838,3,B005HVWVU4,"I was expecting a harem comedy piece of fluff, given the cutesy little girls pictured on the cover, and that's how this show started out.  A teenage boy named Rin lives in an alternate version of today where gateways have been opened to the realm of the demons and the realm of the gods.  Many gods and demons live on Earth and their children attend school with regular humans.  One day, two men show up in Rin's class, announce that they are the King of the Gods and the King of the Demons.  They are there to enroll their daughters in school and announce that Rin must marry one of the daughters and thus become the next king of either the god or demon realm.  Apparently when they were small children the two girls had, in separate but similar incidents, visited the city, become lost, and little boy Rin found them and played with them for a couple of hours until the parents showed up.  According to the standard anime cliche rules, the two girls were deeply impressed, spent the next several years thinking about Rin and deciding they loved him while Rin largely had no recollection of the incidents.  Anyway, that is why the two Kings proclaimed that Rin would become somebody's son-in-law.  I also wondered if the Japanese really know what Gods and Demons are supposed to be, as both groups seem the same as normal humans except for funny ears and occasionally using some magic.  The daughter of the King of the Gods seemed decidedly more demon-like than the other girl at times.  I guess they were following harem comedy rule 13b. ""where feasible, some of the females vying for the male's attention should be of another species, be artificially created, or have supernatural powers, while still appearing mostly human except for minor non-repulsive alterations"".

The first few episodes were standard harem stuff with the girls swooning over Rin, Rin being largely oblivious, and some slapstick action involving fan clubs.  Around episode 8 or so one of the characters became involved in a science-fictiony subplot and the show was dramatic and weepy for a few episodes.  Then around episode 14, the day shift writers apparently knocked off for the day, the night shift writers arrived and the whole feel of the show shifted.  Suddenly characters were exposing psychotic alternate personalities, emotional and some physical violence ensued, a character developed a mysterious malady, and the series turned into a soap opera.  At this point I was thinking what the heck?

If you are expecting just a standard harem comedy, you might want to stop watching around episode 8.  Definitely stop around 13.  That's where the laughs stop and you are apparently expected to haul out the box of tissues.  I'm not saying the show was bad, it just kind of wandered all over the place from slapstick to melodrama.",1431302400,6,2809,4.802494802494802
4706839,5,B005HVWVU4,"In a world where Gods and Demons live, but its not like what you would expect at all! please enjoy the review!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers only) In this world, we call it earth. Gods and Demons from both Heaven and Hell have come to Earth. But it is not like how we see them normally, Gods and Demons are nice people! and some have come looking...for love <3 . Rin Tsuchimi a human is enjoying his life, living with his live in girl (not dateing) friend Kaede Fuyou. One day in school there is a 2 transfer students one from the world of the Gods and one from the world of Demons. Lisianthus aka Sia a God, and Nerine a Demon, they are brought into the class room by their fathers who are the king of gods and king of the demons. When both girls see Rin they go up to him and are like ""thats the one!"" then the fathers proclaim to Rin that both daughters love him so he must choose a wife! and in so comes the adventures of Rin and him trying to find true love!

Pros: Best of all this is the UNCUT and UNCENSORED version, so you get to see some boobs and butt uncensored.

Pros 2: the story is well written out. There are some perverted jokes at time but nothing too over the top. All the characters are well deveolped so you feel connected to them.

Cons: honestly without spoiling it, the ending is NOT what i expected, there is an ending but its nothing you would expect.

The characters are all memorable for the most part and not copy paste  personality's. Of course you will have the childhood friend, but what harem doesn't?

Five women in total, however this anime has a unique twist tho. Two of the girls are Prince's. One the daughter of the Demon lord and the other is the daughter of ""The king of the Gods"". Who will he choose?

I usually don't leave negative reviews unless I feel like it's my duty to save other people some money. As a fan of the anime genre, I say skip this one and don't reward half-hearted attempts like this. *Slight spoiler* If you must see it, then I recommend pretending that the main character has died and is living in the after-life, receiving his eternal reward of beautiful girls inexplicably and repeatedly throwing themselves at him while he completely takes them for granted, even to the very end with a ""you gotta be kidding me"" finale.",1397347200,2,761,4.7293233082706765

4706899,4,B005HVWVU4,"I really enjoyed this series, flaws and all. The storyline had enough twists and turns that I was always anxious to see what happened next. It does contain some brief nudity, but this was plot-driven, never giving the impression that it was added simply for the benefit of pubescent male viewers. Even the obligatory panty-shots are done humorously, and could offend only the most prudish viewer.

The problems I had with the series fall into two categories. Firstly, there was very little personality difference between the two girls who were supposedly competing for the hand of the hero, and there was almost no tension between them. Both seemed to prefer sulking in silence when they felt neglected or ignored. Compare this to what is probably my all-time favorite series in this genre, Rosario + Vampire, where the girls are more than willing to fight (literally tooth and nail) for their ""share"" of the hero. My other main issue with Shuffle has to do with later plot elements, most of which seemed to have come from ideas the writers got between the first and second seasons, with the result that it seemed patchwork.

The ultimate test of a series of any kind is if one wishes it wouldn't end--or at least that the ending given is soul-satisfying. Without giving spoilers, I have to say that Shuffle passed the test.",1391731200,,1324,4.802631578947368

While this is a harem anime it focuses on romance, humor and drama instead of fan service. The male protagonist is not a pervert with a heart of gold like in most harem animes, but instead is genuinely a nice guy which is why hes in the situation he finds himself in.

4706920,5,B005HVWVU4,"A seen in the other review, this is structurally like many Harem-type shows.  One guy; several girls all trying to edge each other out in their quest to be the person said guy chooses.

The main cast is your standard run, a pair of princesses form different worlds who are rivals for the mans hearts, but are friendly with each other otherwise, The girl to small to be counted as a legitimate love interest (but is portrayed with a serious character, rather then the normal, hyperactive, irritating standard), The pretty, almost inhumanly sweetness and light roommate whom the man takes for granted, yet also ends up possibly the scariest of them all, and the good friend who does not realize she has feelings for the guy, but nevertheless enjoys teasing him

The supporting cast also is very well done, with the girl who has no interest in the protagonist, outside an occasion barb about how she wouldn't mind entering the running, just to needle one of the others, and just generally gets off on the romantic tangle that surrounds her friends, to the seemingly necessary one with a flat chest who is insecure about it around such buxom company, and compensates by being aggressive, to the perverted male friend who takes pleasure in announcing his kinks and needling the protagonist about his luck in being the focal point for the lovelies, and even the mostly comic relief provided by the King of Gods with his larger then life persona, and King of Demons, who is slightly more calm, but just as arrogant.

Even the Protagonist is not to bad.  He is aware of the girls, knows they are pretty, is NOT bumbling, and does not consider himself deserving of the attention for the most part. He even is considerate of the girls feelings a bit here and there, though near the end, kind of gets tunnel vision and cant see any signs until they smack him in the face, and even then pretty much ignores most of them, but contextually, it is almost forgivable.

While the character structure does not vary from SOP, each of the characters is interesting, has their own justifiable motivations, and gives a firm, believable reason for consideration.  While there is, of course, a focus on boobage, it is not too overblown, and the same trope is hardly ever used more then once, (EX: he only accidently walks in on a girl in the bathroom once in the run, rather then once per episode) giving a nice variety, and resisting the formulaic feel of some others (EX: Love Hina).

Story wise, I found this unexpectedly enjoyable.  While there were minor elements of examining cultural differences from the Princesses of Gods and Demons, it was very minor.  Structure wise, it was not the expected 24 episodes of guy getting hounded  by pretty girls in various combinations (again a la Love Hina), but more akin to what I have seen in Sword Art Online, with one main start plot, and an ending broken into arcs radically different from the start.

The first roughly half of the series is a string of unconnected snippets of the high school life of all the characters, and is simple a light hearted soft romance with all the players being introduced, and their surface motivations an personality revealed.  The second act delves more into the inter darkness in each of the girls, with the overall feel of the show going from comedic and smile inducing Harem, to a much darker, inner demons type thing, that can bring tears almost as frequently as the first half could bring a chuckle. All of this, I felt, was focused down and presented in such a smooth curve, that you almost don't notice the winnowing until you are 3-4 episodes into the semifinal arc, and you realize that you haven't seen more then a cameo from half the characters in a while.  While one of the final plot devices is pretty much a standard clich at this point, I feel it was handled with a fair amount of subtlety, and was used to good effect.  The biggest thing I enjoyed about the plot, was the fact that unlike so very many others, the ending is not left open, the protagonist has made a clear choice, and is not left dangling.

Overall, I strongly recommend this if you like romantic type Anime, that can get heavy, but still end it on a high note.  If you are just looking for a bubbly little love story, this is not that.  If you want one that can make you laugh, cry, and smile, with good characterization, and no really irritating characters, this is a fair choice.",1381708800,,4423,4.6055979643765905
4706921,5,B005HVWVU4,"I have a love/hate thing with these SAVE editions. On the one hand, it is VERY reasonably priced. On the other hand, I kind of like the look of owning multiple volumes, having the great artwork filling my shelf. However, with today's prices in Anime, those kinds of collections end up costing you hundreds. Not matter how much you enjoy a series, it is hard to justify owning it in a multi-volume set. Furthermore, if space is limited, you might not have the space to devote to such things.
The SAVE editions are great in those regards. You pay less than way the series would typically cost, and it takes up no more room than a single DVD case. This isn't low-quality either. I compared this with the first volume that I had in the regular set, and found the artwork on the disc to be IDENTICAL!
So lose the extra dollars, don't shell out a fortune for extra plastic and paper. I fully support the SAVE movement, and I anticipate owning several other series in these editions.
As for the show, I think the fact that I won both a set in the regular edition and the SAVE editions speaks for itself. One of the very best MOE/HAREM animes ever produced, and EXTREMELY watchable even with the english dubs.

He comes across as a nice, respectful boy that all of the girls are fawning over, yet he leads all of the girls on and doesn't make a decision as to which one will be his girlfriend until the end of the series long after the stuff begins to hit the fan.  Not cool, dude.  And yet unrealistically, the girls still fawn over him afterwards.  I know this is anime but still...

4706928,5,B005HVWVU4,"This is a series that needs little introduction, because it is widely regarded as one of the best ""Slice of Life"" series out there. It's based on the visual novel of the same name by Navel, and while it does take some liberties with the novels story it is true to the source material all the way up to the climax. It incorporates the best scenes from the VN while adding lots of great additional story work along the way.

Rin is a young man who could become King of the Gods or Demons, or simply fall in love with a human girl, and the chemistry between the characters is satisfying. My only real regret for this series is that one of the main characters, Nerine, essentially plays second fiddle to most of the other girls. Her story from the VN is condensed into Primula's story, giving her surprisingly little screen time considering the fact she was one of the ""main 3"" choices in the novel. Sia, on the other hand, is given way too much screen time, with her stories taking up multiple episodes. Despite this the overall story is wonderful. The humor is rich, the drama is mellow, and the fan service is constantly trying to one up itself. 5 out 5.

4706955,4,B005HVWVU4,"First of all I have watched both the ""Shuffle!"" anime and played through most of the ""Shuffle!"" visual novel available from MangaGamer. Needless to say that while both the anime and the game tend to be somewhat bipolar in regards to being romantic comedies and dramatic comedies it is my opinion that the visual novel is more enjoyable, if only a little bit more enjoyable.

I disliked how the Japanese voices in the subtitled version felt emotionless compared to the English voices, and in my opinion Funimation does a terrible job at creating subtitles. Furthermore I disliked how the ""Shuffle!"" anime was often times more bipolar in it's waffling between romantic comedy and romantic drama and even went as far as to invent events that are not canon to the storyline in the ""Shuffle!"" universe. I won't spoil anything but in hindsight I would have been happier not watching a few of the episodes.

However, I enjoyed the English voices in the dubbed version, and I liked how some of the scenes made me feel sad or happy for the characters involved. I like an anime that makes me cry when I feel these beautiful emotions. I also enjoyed the opening theme song and listen to it regularly on my MP3 player and on my computer via Winamp.

I would recommend that if you do want to watch this anime and not enjoy the visual novel franchise that spawned this anime that you be someone that has enjoyed anime that were similarly bipolar in their decision to waffle between being a romantic comedy and a romantic drama. You might also like ""Shuffle!"" in regards to both the anime and the visual novel if you are a fan of harem anime or fantasy anime that take place in modern settings.

Overall a four-star anime, but I still recommend that if you want the whole story that you play the visual novels from MangaGamer that spawned this anime - ""Shuffle!"" , ""Shuffle! Tick! Tack!"" and ""Shuffle! Really? Really!"" - and furthermore hope that they translate the rest of the franchise as well.",1364688000,,1981,4.651428571428571

I watched this yesterday.  I must admit I almost quit half way through.  You have ample opportunity for magic and comedy but there isn't much of either.  Instead I found a anime soap opera with the rare glimpse of skin.  From reading the description I had hoped for more but hey I took a chance.  So here is what I liked and disliked about it.

Like:

The music isn't irritating but the kittens they used at the cut were horrible.

The anime is well drawm using lights and darks to change the tone.

There was some skin and it was drawn well.

The background of each girl is done seperately.  This gives the watcher time to decide on the girl they like best.  Making it to this point takes around 400 minutes of the 600 minute series.

Like the ending or not it actually ended and the plot was resolved.  He chooses a girl.

Disliked:

The main character is a brainless pushover doing whatever the girls tell him to.  He goes with anything they say.  Its like they tell him what they want and he just goes with it.  ""Girl: hey Ri lets bury you up to your neck in garbage.  Ri: Sounds great.""

Fan service is at a minimum.  This is sad because its implied everywhere even in the show itself so many missed opportunities.

There is no action or humor.  Usually Harems lead to wacky situations fights between the girls and violence.  Everyone seemed fine with the situation.  Nobody complained or really fought over him.  Some of the girls had magical power but rarely ever used it for any reason.  The small attempts at humor via the KKK fell flat.  In essence this is straight up drama.

The first half I neither liked nor disliked any of the characters.  It took so long to find out any background that I almost gave up and quit watching.

I guessed which girl correctly before the second disc finished.  There are four DVD's.  It drove me crazy but I watched every episode.

Just so you know what your getting into.

If you like HAREM-DRAMA, Brief Nudity and a good plot resolution (I say resolution not simply Good Plot.  Its a harem that should tell you the plot right away)  If not the the brief nudity my wife would have watched it like a soap opera.

If you prefer HAREM-COMEDY lots of fan service and laughs try something else like Heavens Lost Property or even Rosario+Vampire.

I gave this three stars for good reason.  I wasn't looking for a HAREM-DRAMA but I did manage to finish it.  Two stars were deducted because of misleading descriptions and images.",1357862400,,2549,4.4792122538293215
4706963,4,B005HVWVU4,OK so this is one of my fave animes it has great story and kind a twist near the end. It came in perfect order,1356825600,,110,3.44

4706965,1,B005HVWVU4,"If you're thinking of buying Shuffle! then you're familiar with the ""Harem"" genre. An average Japanese ""everyman"" who is more boring than plain oatmeal becomes the focus of affection for a bevy of beauties and hilarity ensues.

He becomes involved in increasingly ""wacky"" hi-jinx while trying to choose a woman out of the litter to spend the rest of his life with. It's usually the first one he meets, or the one with pink hair.

I am hear to tell you, you will not find that in this anime. This is a bait and switch. On the cover or the trailer it may appear to be a light-hearted anime comedy. In actuality it is a deep and very emotional drama that is filled with 90% of the characters having unrequited feelings for probably the biggest tool in harem anime history ""Rin Tsuchimi.""

I have seen many harem animes and this is the first one that made me hate the main character with a burning rage that I usually reserve for Catelyn Tully or Sansa Stark.

Seriously this guy is scum. Not only is he incapable of making a simple decision as ""Which hot girl would you like to be with"" but he spends a good majority of the series treating one character like his personal door mat and then leaving her when she has a mental break down of EPIC proportions.

So, if that sounds like something you'd be interested in watching then by all means pick this baby up. But if you were like me and thought ""Hey stupid harem anime. The popcorn of anime. Just turn my brain off and start laughing"" then please look else where.

There is nothing here but sadness that will leave you feeling hollow for days to come.",1356739200,7,1599,4.403389830508474

4706971,5,B005HVWVU4,"This anime does come with a bit of fan service, something I am not really into. I forgave it though. The characters are well developed and the story keeps a good pace. The ending was a little expected, but the way they got their was terrific and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like Anime like Clannad and Kanon, this is pretty similar, but with more laughs and fan service.",1353888000,,374,4.357142857142857
4706972,5,B005HVWVU4,"Shuffle! is a series in which the archtypical hero is forced to choose between 5 different women with their own attributes and abilities.  Two of the women come from the realms of Gods and Demons, both seeking to marry the hero for their respective random incidents that happened 8 years prior.  Another woman acts as the housekeeper to the hero and feels guilty for the ill-treatment she performed on him also 8 years prior.  The other two are that of a good friend that greets the hero with a slap on the back and a young demon that was artificially created as a joint-effort between Gods and Demons.
This anime was a big let-down for me in that I am more of a harem-style ending sort of person.  However, this anime does tackle the concept of what happens to the women who are left out, which is quite difficult and truly amazing to see accomplished.  Though it contains some nudity to add to the fan-service, this anime holds a lot of character and is definitely worth watching.
I warn you, watching this anime may make you sad because of the choices made...",1352246400,,1062,4.510416666666667
4706973,5,B005HVWVU4,"At first I wasn't too sure what I was getting when I bought this anime. I quickly found out, however, that it runs a lot deeper than what you would normally expect from a harem anime. The main character truly pulls you in through the roller coaster of his life and emotions as everything slowly goes from semi-normal to near-psychotic. The anime combines moderate fan service of a harem anime to an anime filled with girls with their own special powers and abilities. Overall, this anime swept me away and had me on edge until the very end, and needless to say, I came away very satisfied with the overall series on all levels. I would reccomend this anime to anybody looking to be swept away by a great story filled with great characters and twists and turns.",1351814400,,760,4.5144927536231885

4706975,5,B005HVWVU4,"This story is about a young man named Rin. Rin lives with his friend Kaede. Both of them lost their mothers in an accident, and Kaede takes care of Rin's every need. It looks like they will always be together, until a couple of princesses form other worlds show up and ask him to choose one of them to marry.

After things start to settle down a young girl comes from the demon world to live with Kaede and Rin, making everything even more crazy. With all these really great ladies after his attention Rin must choose one, and break the others hearts.

This story is very good. It's a great harem style anime with lots of awesome characters and plot twists. It is also very emotional. The last 6 episodes or so are really heavy. The animation quality and voice acting are also very good in this anime. I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you do too.",1350604800,3,920,4.317919075144508
4706976,5,B005HVWVU4,"Simply one of the best anime series I have ever had the privilege to watch,a beautifully written storyline interwoven with beautiful artwork make this one of my all time favorite anime series!!! As with all the other reviews,it does have some fan service,but not too graphic,and it actually had to do with the story,not just for no purpose besides exciting people. The characters are very well developed,and progress into more complex characters,some you will love even more,others you will possibly hate. From beginning to end,this series will have you laughing,excited,mad,and maybe even crying,that being said,emotionally this series is very complex. I give it 5 out of 5 stars only because there is no 6 star!!! I'm glad I bought it,and I'm sure you will enjoy all 24 episodes if you decide to purchase it to. Shuffle has its place on my top 5 anime series.",1348617600,,861,4.944827586206896
4706977,2,B005HVWVU4,"At first I thought that this was an interesting watch, but somewhere along the line it just became irritating.

What do you call a guy that lives with a girl that loves him, takes care of him every day, is there for him whenever he needs her....but most of the time he's busy playing match making with other girls?

Is that romance? Is that love? The guy is plain and simply...a cad...the lowest scum.

He gets this nice girl to basically take care of all of his chores while he's out busy playing match making with other girls. I know it's a harem anime but I feel like this anime, the main guy is just a punk that likes everything handed to him. Kind and pretty girls, a brainless tool as his maid, and even has other people setting up dates for him. They love him for his kindness, but he's basically playing possum while all of these girls are working so hard to please him.

And then there's the fathers that are giving the thumbs up to this whole ordeal. If I was a father, I'd say ""forget this loser, there's tons of guys out there that'll truly appreciate you and the time you give them, great guys, much better guys""

I would never want my daughter to waste her time fighting with other girls for a lousy, indecisive guy.

This anime doesn't add a single thing new or interesting to the harem genre. Typical nice guy that's good to every girl that he sees, closet pervert, a best guy friend that is the comedic relief, and some brainless beauties.

If you want to date all these girls, move out of Kaede's (girl that's been taking care of him since he was young while he's busy playing match making with other girls) house and stop using her like that you bum. Harem animes are usually fun to watch but there's a line between amusing and fun and just plain cruel and irritating.",1348185600,3,1787,4.348348348348348

It starts a little slow, but at the end of the anime series it became highly addicting and dark in my opinion. There are a few episodes that are a bit silly, but there are more episodes that make this anime really fun to watch. Not only does it have nudity here and there, but some episodes are very touching. Im on episode #19 right now and its so Dark, and im very satisfied with the overall anime.",1499472000,,511,4.069306930693069
