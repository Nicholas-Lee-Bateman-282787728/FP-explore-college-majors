So warm yourself up a pint of plasma, grab a bowl of Dracula's favorite snack crackers (scabs), sharpen that trusty rusty scalpel and have at these ""classics.""

LOWLIGHTS--

Appearing in HELL'S HIGHWAY is Ron Jeremy, who rumor has it was able at age 10 to use a certain part of his body as a grade-school ruler. The movie itself is a sort of demented man's version of ""Monster"" (which starred Charlize Theron as Aileen Wournos), the difference being, in this film the homicidal hitchhiker (Phoebe Dollar) is a hottie, and the killings are far more gratuitous and gory.

NIGHMARE ASYLUM runs a little over an hour, but if you make it through to the end, it is guaranteed to be the LONGEST 69 minutes of your life. ""Director Todd Sheets Another Brick"" should have been on this one's movie poster. Be sure to watch for Charlie Angell, who plays the lovable ""Goon,"" and take care that you don't get caught in the man-sized mousetrap!

In TALES OF TERROR, hyper-spazzy Dr. Shock (or is it ""Schlock""?) is host of four disgusting little stories:  ""Bullet for a Vampire,"" ""The Town That Loved Pizza,"" ""The Garden Tool Murders,"" and ""Demons Day."" Kindly don't ask which is the best of the bunch...

MAXIM MEDIA's ""Pendulum Pictures"" horror films are distributed exclusively by MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT. These movies are a throwback to the early '60s type of drive-in theater gorefests that were once popular with teens. If you're looking for big-budget state of the art special effects and top rank actors this series may not be right for you. Fans of murder, mayhem and maniacs will not be disappointed by this little collection, however.

Do you REALLY want more, dear little Oliver? OK.. how about PENDULUM's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Sickos/dp/B000F9SUSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Sickos</a>, then? It's genuinely ""gruel""ing stuff!
