8407493,5,B003WQ5C34,The extra concert footage was better than the main boston concert. It was G G at his finest! I liked it.,1379289600,,104,4.0
8407494,5,B003WQ5C34,"I have all the official G.G. Allin dvd's available and must definetly recomend this one.
While the feature show (Boston 89) is just Ok, the dvd features 2 bonus full concerts that are just INSANE. Even MORE intense and shocking than usual!!! ...and if you know GG, you know the standard show was always VERY wild.
Obviously THIS is NOT for everybody, but if you are reading this you know what to expect.
The wildest of the wild performing on two specially wild nights.",1312848000,4,468,4.583333333333333
