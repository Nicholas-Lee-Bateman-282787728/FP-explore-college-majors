8164938,3,B000LXHFSG,"What the title means is anybody's guess.  This is an OK Edgar Wallace adaptation about an evil man who is officially a lawyer but whose real moneymaking activities are less than legitimate.  He is thought to be responsible for the suicide of a young woman and two days before the one year anniversery he receives a wreath of flowers from master criminal The Ringer telling him he will be dead on the day after tomorrow.  But The Ringer is supposedly dead and he's a master of disguise so even if he is alive nobody knows what he actually looks like.

The police surround the house of the intended victim and try to provide protection on the fateful day, but they also know that The Ringer's intended target is an evil man so their heart isn't exactly in protecting him.  Still, if The Ringer is alive how can he possibly get to his target with all of the police around and when they know the date and possibly even the hour that he plans to strike?

This isn't one of the better Edgar Wallace adaptations--The Dark Eyes of London starring Bela Lugosi is far superior.  But if you like 1930's mysteries The Gaunt Stranger is certainly watchable enough, with the novelty being that the killer (The Ringer) isn't really the film's villain--his intended victim is.  You are actually supposed to be rooting for the killer to succeed.  The Ringer is also very likely one of the characters in the film in disguise--unless he really is dead and his widow intends to commit the murder.

The transfer is above average for an Alpha Video Release with a pretty clean print and good contrast.  Sometimes Alpha Video prints are beat up or washed out, but that isn't the case with The Gaunt Stranger.  But if you aren't already a fan of mystery writer Edgar Wallace this movie isn't likely to make you one.",1486857600,,1791,4.5625
