8737635,1,B016ZG7CX0,Ridiculous this dvd! It looks like a pirate one! Bad image and sound! Ridicolous,1461542400,,80,4.785714285714286
8737636,1,B016ZG7CX0,Pretty much not what it seems to be. Mainly low tech bits from television of what appears to be the 60s. Willie is in 2 or 3 tracks. The rest are Dolly and a few others. Can't give more information as we did not listen to the entire DVD. Off to the Library.,1455840000,,257,3.8679245283018866
8737637,3,B016ZG7CX0,Disappointed as I thought there would be some new footage and the resolution was not very good.  Ok for background music but I could also listen to a CD.,1455062400,,153,4.275862068965517
8737638,1,B016ZG7CX0,"Such poor quality and just a load of rubbish really. Nothing like it was billed to be, very disappointed. Would have been OK if the sound and graphics were re digitized but its really crappy.",1453161600,,191,4.485714285714286
