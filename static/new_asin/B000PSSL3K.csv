8193179,5,B000PSSL3K,"A laudatory, and long, biopic about the young Winston Churchill from childhood trough his years as a war correspondent in Africa during the Boer War and the rebellion in the Sudan, to his first election to Parliament. Director Richard Attenborough's attention to correct historical detail is deserving of kudos, for it can be so easy to fudge everything in favor of some sort of superhero tale. Robert Shaw and Anne Bancroft as perfect as Winston's father, Lord Randolph and his American mother, Jennie. And Simon Ward, as the older Winston, is marvelous. A side note on Attenborough: while any other director would simply have had Winston pack an ordinary revolver, Attenborough goes to the trouble to ensure that Winston packs the Mauser C96, a pistol Churchill wrote of in his memoirs quite fondly, as it saved his life on more than one occasion. This movie is testament to the fact that one can tell the facts correctly and still be most entertaining.",1285545600,6,955,4.901234567901234
