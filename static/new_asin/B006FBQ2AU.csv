8496972,5,B006FBQ2AU,"So for the person that left the 1 star in regarding to it not telling the beginning of the story in this specific DVD  series.. It is because there is 2 series to this soap opera... And this specific DVD case  is the second part.. Not the 1st one.. The 1st series starts from the beginning and shows you in details how it all begings and the 2nd series just leaves off of where it ended on the 1st series... But it's the enire soap opera.. Complete, I am very happy with it and I hope El seor de Los cielos also goes on DVD.. Another soap opera that is right next to La Reina Del Sur...",1370649600,,586,4.0
