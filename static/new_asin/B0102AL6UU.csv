7304999,5,B0102AL6UU,one of the saddest voyages of one piece. You can definitely see the stakes are higher now since the straw hats are notorious around the world and everyone wants their head. Such an emotional ride with this voyage.,1441929600,,213,4.631578947368421

7305001,4,B0102AL6UU,"Absolutely kick butt action in this voyage, but be prepared for the second saddest episode so far in the entire One Piece series (Episode 405).  The absolute saddest episode is Episode 483 so stay tuned for that.  All I can say is that Luffy and Co. finally run into a situation that they have no chance of overcoming and Luffy (for the first time in his life) calls a retreat.  And in the end, they have to pay a terrible price even to be able to get away.  The makers of the One Piece series probably realized that fans needed to cheer up after this, so they aired a couple of Boss Luffy specials for Episodes 406 and 407.  As with the Boss Luffy specials in the Enies Lobby arc, we get a delightful recasting of familiar characters in a comical story.  The last two episodes get into the brief Amazon Lily arc which the hentai fans have been waiting for.  Sadly we're going to have to wait for the first episode of Voyage 3 to see Boa Hancock for the first time.  Super value since you get a baker's dozen and not just a standard dozen episodes in this volume.",1440288000,3,1063,4.253731343283582
