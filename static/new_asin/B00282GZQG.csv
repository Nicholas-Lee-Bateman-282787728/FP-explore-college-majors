8355528,5,B00282GZQG,You need this video. Like all the Colonial Williamsburg videos it gives great insight into how things were made 250 years ago.  Although it was filmed in the late 1960's the production values are very good.,1390003200,,206,4.722222222222222
8355529,4,B00282GZQG,"I bought this because my son was reading ""Johnny Tremain"" and I was rereading it when he wasn't using the book.  I realized that I knew very little about how colonial silversmiths did their work and I knew that my son had absolutely no conception of what a colonial workshop would look like and I wanted to make that aspect of the book more real to him.

This was was very a very good education on the subject.  You get a clear overview of the control the crown had over colonial craftsmen and why, about how continental style influence the colonies, what was involved with taking orders, making molds, pouring silver... in general, just HOW MUCH work went into a piece of silver.

When I ordered the DVD my son said that was really good because he'd maybe like to make something out of silver the old way sometime... and it's a good thing I knew that was highly unlikely because when he saw how much skill and work and time went into even a simple piece he had a change of heart.  I guess I could be disappointed that he won't be pursuing this mild interest he previously had but at the same time I am glad he has a true appreciation now of what it took to have things back when machines didn't spit out a little bit of everything...",1381190400,,1234,4.301724137931035
8355530,5,B00282GZQG,"I saw this in grade school back in the early 70's.  This and the other Williamsburg video, Gunsmith of Williamsburg, are fascinating documentaries about how things are made.  Every child should see things like this to encourage their curiosity and creativity.

Adults will love this as they will see how complex things were made of metal long before the Industrial Revolution.

In the Silversmith DVD you will see a beautiful wood handled decorative silver coffee pot made step by stop, starting by making ingots of melted silver, then hammering them out to sheet, then forming the parts of the pot from the silver sheet.  All by hand!  In addition there's less detailed coverage of a silver drinking cup.",1355184000,3,705,4.932203389830509
8355531,5,B00282GZQG,"I loved this video, even though I couldn't help thinking that this was the kind of blandly narrated film that a teacher would have made us watch in elementary school. I've just started this kind of raising and forming work shown in the film, and I had kept thinking that I needed more technology and modern tools to help me, where this showed me what I need is actually more wisdom and patience. Their resulting smithed work was absolutely beautiful.",1351123200,,450,4.6375
8355532,5,B00282GZQG,"When I was teaching, I showed The Silversmith of Williamsburg to my 8th graders.  They were fascinated by it.  I decided to add it to my personal library.",1347321600,,154,4.464285714285714
