Park Shin Hye and Jang Geun Suk have excellent chemistry together,  Jang Geun Suk has such great versatility in the various roles he plays in different movies. These actors work well together and honestly you can tell they work hard..  The music was excellent as well! Beautiful voices of Shin Hye and Geun Suk!  All these musicians are amazing! This is one of my favorite Korean movies.",1441670400,,447,4.766233766233766

The picture quality is fantastic, but the subtitles! - Best I've ever seen for this drama, and translated very well. I'm so happy with this product.",1441497600,,442,4.402439024390244
6948981,5,B00S21P5ZY,VERY VERY PLEASED!!!  This is one of my favorite Kdramas so i wanted it on dvd but was worried about the subtitles and quality.  Picture quality is really good (not HD type) and is pan & scan not widescreen. Subtitles are very good and accurate. Better than Netflix which usually has the best subtitles. have watched all 16 episodes  and NO flaws. These are NOT copies but factory DVDS,1436227200,13,385,4.550724637681159
