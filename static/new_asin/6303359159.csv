7844566,5,6303359159,"But ""The Survivors"" is a beautifully acted tale with a dignified and compassionate performance from veteran character actor John Anderson.  His ""revelation"" to Captain Picard at the installment's ending moments is stunning, bringing to the surface all the years of toiling as a ""heavy"" in so many films and television shows.  It is this rare occasion when the actor showed that he could portray a sympathetic character whose actions are based solely on love and loneliness.",981936000,6,473,5.2105263157894735
7844567,4,6303359159,"Responding to a distress call from a colony on Rana Four, the Enterprise discovers that everyone on the planet is dead except for an elderly couple, Kevin and Rishon Uxbridge.  The Uxbridges have no explanation for the attack, but in the grand tradition of colonists everywhere they refuse to leave their home.  But this is not the only mystery.  An alien warship suddenly appears, fires on the Enterprise and then runs away.  The warship then returns with better weaponry, this time forcing the Enterprise to retreat.  Figuring out that the two mysteries are somehow related, Picard tells the Uxbridges that the Enterprise will remain in orbit to protect them.  Again the alien warship appears, but this time it destroys the Uxbridges and their home.  However, when Picard monitors the site from orbit, the house and the old couple reappear.  Picard is coming closer and closer to the truth.
A simple episode with a rather interesting mystery, ""The Survivors"" is a different sort of love story.  It is also one of the better mysteries to confront Picard outside of a holodeck Dixon Hill adventure.  This is not one of those mysteries you are going to figure out from the clues, but when all the pieces are put together you will admire the completed puzzle.  ""The Survivors"" is also about responsibility and justice on a more than human scale.  One thing I have always appreciated about Star Trek: The Next Generation is that the show was not afraid to confront things bigger than ourselves.  Ultimately, the progress of humanity in the Star Trek universe is judged not only by how Picard et al. deal with the ""lesser"" lifeforms but how they respond to the ""greater"" powers as well.",973209600,,1682,4.839160839160839
7844568,5,6303359159,"In this episode, the Enterprise responds to a distress signal to discover a colony that's been wiped out.  A closer scan reveals a small patch of land that has not been destroyed with two survivors.  Attempts to evacuate  the survivors meets with another attack from the aliens.
For it's time,  the battle between the alien vessel and the Enterprise was pretty darn  cool.  In addition learning about this retired couple who survived the  attack kept me interested through out the episode.",949276800,6,489,4.962962962962963
