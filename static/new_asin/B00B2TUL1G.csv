5553382,3,B00B2TUL1G,"Whoever says that this was an excellent transfer is false. If you compare this to Bandai's release back in 2010 you'll realize that section 21 did a s***ty job at hte transfer to blu-ray. I bought mine, popped it in the blu-ray player and what to I see? An upscale version with the grain from VHS to dvd port era! This isn't blu-ray quality at all! Section 21/Made in Japan makes blu-ray look like joke. Not only that, the subtitles are sloppily put together. The subtitles are way to large for the video and they often go beyond the constraints of the 4:3 standard resolution screen. This is crap production quality. This looks nothing like the Japanese conversion procedure from dvd to blu-ray. Section 21 thought they could pull a cheap one over us by not grabbing the remastered blu-ray versions from Bandai, instead give us an upscale version from the older DVD releases.

I suggest to you all to keep away from this version and buy bandai's blu-ray release. It's cleaner and looks appropriate for blu-ray!",1380585600,3,1011,4.711864406779661
5553383,4,B00B2TUL1G,Looks beautiful on Blue-ray; you can hardly guess this show was made in the '80s.  Buy this so we can get the full Patlabor series and movies.,1376870400,,142,4.2592592592592595
5553384,4,B00B2TUL1G,"Fantastic OVA!  I have always wanted to see the Patlabor series.  Being a fan of 1980s mecha anime, I found it quite difficult to resist checking this out when I saw a Blu-Ray edition being released.

The picture quality is quite amazing.  I'd never seen an anime with such clean and pristine quality that you can literally see the paint and quality of the animation cel in some scenes.  It is phenomenal!

The show itself is quite surprising,  I thought it may have a a serious tone, coming from Mamoru Oshii of Ghost in the Shell fame, but the OVA is quite lighthearted.  Not to mention, there is a considerable lack of mecha action from what looks to be primarily a mecha anime.  It is focused on the the formation of the police unit that utilize the Patlabors to curb Labor (robot) crime.  Quite a different spin on the genre.

The show is two handfuls of episodes plus three movies within this part of Patlabor canon.  The TV series exists on its own.

Great Blu-Ray, great purchase!",1374710400,3,988,4.5141242937853105
5553385,3,B00B2TUL1G,"This show is 6 Episodes, each one with a different story to it, some nicer some worst.
Old style animation, if you are looking for Ghost in the shell, this is NOT close even.

Patlabor is an OK show,
There is barely any action, animation is old but nothing impressive, nothing really remarkable about it, I own the 3 movies, and I love the firt 2 movies, they look great with nice action and a good plot, but the show is week for my taste.",1371254400,2,439,4.1647058823529415
5553386,5,B00B2TUL1G,"I have been waiting, in hope, for an affordable re-release of the original Patlabor! I have been a, sort of underground, Patlabor fan for several years, but I could not bring myself to pay the ridiculous price it originally was. However, let's move on to an actual review.

First, I am reluctant to even call Patlabor an anime. It's more of a toned-down animated sci-fi. I, myself, am really not an amine fan, but more of a general sci-fi fan. I say this meaning that Patlabor can be enjoyed by all kinds of people, not just anime fans. In fact many anime fans are fond of Patlabor because of how conservative and simple it is. Patlabor is very different from other mech shows, such as Gundam, Macross, and Eureka 7. In fact, Patlabor is only partially about mechs. The mechs in Patlabor are more like a futuristic symbol or a team mascot than a plot builder.

Patlabor is about a lousy Tokyo police unit called SV2 (Special Vehicles Unit 2). In the ""future"" (1999, ten years after the series was created), labors (mechs) are used for general construction work. However, in a large city like Tokyo, crime involving labors rose and now is not uncommon. Hence, the creation of police patrol labor units or patlabors. The series starts out by introducing the members of SV2 with them ... well, not doing much of anything. I admit, I too was thrown off by the series sort of awkward and boring introduction. I was especially thrown off by the lack of background sounds, and choppy, redundant dialogue. But keep watching, this is done on purpose! Patlabor, in both the OVA and TV series, starts off with SV2 doing simple everyday police missions (but with mechs), comedic filler episodes, and with SV2, as I said before, sitting around the unit doing nothing.

However, this method of story development makes the characters so much more relatable and real than in the violent, overly dramatic, typical action cartoon. But keep watching, the series builds a lot of intensity in episodes 5, 6, and 7. I promise desire for action will not go unsatisfied, as this group of lousy, ordinary cops are put into extraordinary situations. This is the beauty of the show.

So if your hoping for an unoriginal robots-fighting-and-blowing-things-up show (not that there is anything wrong with those), this is not Patlabor. However if you want something feel-good with a good story and funny characters but ends with a bang, Patlabor is the show for you. If you enjoy the OVA, watch the movies and TV series. The best Patlabor has to offer is actually movies 1 and 2. The great thing about the OVA series is that it is sort and cheap. So if it doesn't impress you, which honestly it does not appeal to everyone, you have not wasted a lot of time and money.",1370563200,,2737,4.6604554865424435
5553387,4,B00B2TUL1G,"I was disappointed to find that there was no new dubbing for this like the special edition versions of the movies. There also aren't really any extras included which is unfortunate. If you already own the old Central Park Media DVD version and are not concerned with picture quality I suggest you stick with it since that version includes some cool extras like director's commentary from Mamoru Oshii.

However, that version has become quite rare and expensive so if you just want to see the original Patlabor in all of its glory with subtitles (the CPM dub is only present on a few of the episodes anyway) and you don't care about the extras, this is the way to go. It's still a great work that was a brilliant deconstruction of the mecha genre in its day. It's sillier than the movies that followed and but not as silly as the TV series.

If you want serious science fiction then you may prefer the movies and if you want slapstick comedy you may prefer the TV series. This falls somewhere in-between the two. The most dramatic episode was ""The SV2's Longest Day"" which was essentially remade and refined into Patlabor the Movie 2.

If you love Patlabor and late-80's science fiction you can't go wrong. If you're a fan of the movies this is where that ""timeline"" begins (the TV series and second OVA follow a separate timeline as does the manga which is its own thing). Just expect it to be a little different than what you've seen before.",1369526400,,1442,4.538461538461538
5553388,4,B00B2TUL1G,"Japanese animators have always had an obsession with giant robots (among other things).  Even back in the Sixties they were fantasizing about what it would be like to control giant humanoid machines of Awesomeness, and as the Seventies rolled on they made the robots more and more fantastic - nearly godlike superheroes in metal form, usually controlled by a young, Japanese boy who provided wish fulfillment for an entire generation of Japanese youngsters.  Then came ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" in 1979, which took the giant robot and made it a mere tool in a future space war - no more superpowers or abilities appearing out of nowhere, with the human drama taking up as much screen time as the giant robot battles.  ""Gundam"" invented the ""real robot"" genre (even if some of the robot designs were still kinda goofy) with subsequent shows following its lead in showing giant robots that could conceivably exist (never mind that giant bipedal robots over a certain size are impossible, what with weight distribution and all, but that's a topic for another day).  This OVA, released in 1988, went one step further than the other ""real robot"" shows of the time with its premise: what if giant robots existed in TODAY'S world?  ""Mobile Police Patlabor"" is a series that attempts to answer just that, usually with a mix of subtle humor and political intrigue.

Of course, ""Patlabor"" doesn't take place in 1988 (when this was originally released), but ten years in the ""future"" in 1998 (and 15 years now in the past for us - confused yet?).  Taking place in a ""future"" Tokyo that is attempting to reclaim land in Tokyo Bay with a massive construction project called the Babylon Project (our last, best hope for real estate), ""Patlabor"" posits the construction of giant humanoid construction robots called Labors which are used for this mighty effort.  But with the invention of any new technology comes the inevitable perversion of it for criminal purposes, and so the Tokyo Metropolitan Police set up special labor units (or Patlabor - Patrol Labor) to combat growing labor crime.  One of these units, Special Vehicles 2 Unit 2 (or SV2) is headed by the laconic Captain Goto, and is made up entirely of misfits, amongst them a disgruntled industry captain's son, a rabid gun nut, a hen-pecked husband, a quiet giant and a mecha-obsessed perky tomboy.  If the opening intro is to be believed, it is this perky tomboy Noa Izumi who is the star of the show, although I would consider it more of an ensemble piece.  Oh well, it's still nice to see a girl get the attention in a giant robot show opening for a change, at least.

So, how does it hold up?  Well, that depends on how you come into this.  If you watch the original OVA without having seen the two films (also directed by Mamoru Oshii) made afterwards, you will probably have a good time with it - it does provide an amusing deconstruction of giant robot tropes while providing some comedy and some great (for its time) animation.  However, if you have seen the movies first (which is highly probable in the American market with the OVA being unavailable for cheap for many years) like me then you may be slightly disappointed.  The films are more realistic and less wacky, and going from them to this OVA series will make you spot story flaws and problems with realism (sea monsters, really?) as well as the fact that the two-parter ""The SV2's Longest Day"" is essentially the same ""Patlabor 2"" (which used the same plot but with better results).  What you need to understand though, which I came to learn while watching this, is that this OVA series and the films are different beasts, and should be judged differently as the creators were trying to accomplish distinct things with each.

This new DVD set from Maiden Japan is, for the most part, great.  The picture is crystal clear and probably the best looking that this OVA has ever looked.  I have never seen the aforementioned out-of-print (and expensive thanks to scalpers) Central Park Media DVD set but if it was anything like their DVDs for the later Patlabor TV show then I know for a fact that this set is superior by a million times.  The CPM discs for that show were *awful*, some of the worst discs I have ever seen: the picture was mediocre at best, encoding was clunky and even menus were sometimes off-model!  The audio on these new discs (there are two in the set) is great as well, with options for both mono and Dolby 5.1 for the Japanese, along with an English dub track imported from the previous CPM set.  Do not under any circumstances listen to the English dub though as it is infamously one of the worst ever made.  Finally, both discs come in one single-sized standard DVD case with a flipper page holding disc one (instead of stacking discs, which I hate).  Kudos.  The only thing bad about this set is that the back cover advertises as a special feature ""clean opening and closing animation.""  This is a blatant lie.  There are no special features on this set unless you count trailers for other products, which I don't.

+ Good to great animation, good voice acting from Japanese cast, neat premise, some of the humor, great picture and sound on this DVD set.

- Not as engaging, well written or realistic as the movies, some stupid plot points, no special features on this DVD set.

Conclusion - Even though it is not as good as the movies, the original OVA series is still essential to any Patlabor fan.  Don't expect the same world as the two films and you will be fine.  This DVD set, while not having any special features still has great video and audio to compensate for it.  Recommended.",1368489600,2,5624,4.664640324214792
5553389,4,B00B2TUL1G,"In an alternate world, technology has advanced further to the point of the creation of giant robots called Labors. The Labors were designed to help mankind build a better future. However, there are many criminals and terrorists who use labors for their misconduct and tyranny. That's where the Special Vehicles Unit comes in. Formed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police, the SV Unit consists of two divisions. Their mission is to stop and arrest people who misuse Labors, using their own Labors called Patlabors (or Patrol Labors). This story chronicles the lives of squad known as Division 2 (or SV2), led by Captain Kiichi Goto, who is laid-back, yet manipulative. Our protagonists are seven officers in SV2. There's the spunky red-head Noa Izumi, Smart and hot-head Asuma Shinohara, gung-ho Isao Ota, the gentle giant Hiromi Yamazaki and the meek and married member of the squad, Mikiyasu Shinshi. Later, they are joined by the cool and by-the-book Kanuka Clancy, who used to be from the NYPD. There's also Captain Shinobu Nagumo of SV1, who acts as Goto's foil, Chief Sakaki, head of mechanics that serve SV2 and the second-in command to Sakaki and Labor nut Chief Shigeo Shiba.

In 1988, the artist group Headgear (consisting of director Mamoru Oshii, screenplay writer Kazunori Ito, manga artist Masami Yuki, character designer Akemi Takeda and mecha designer Yutaka Izubuchi) all formed to what is now known as Patlabor. This seven-episode OVA was the first of their endeavors. The show was animated by Studio DEEN (Urusei Yatsura, Ramna 1/2).  It episodes vary in the sense of comedy and drama, set up against a police mecha background. All of the character are unique and their chemistry and dynamic are what makes the show interesting. My favorite character is Captain Goto. He is a very mysterious and complex man, willing to do whatever he can all while keeping a cool head. His relationship of Captain Nagumo is very different and not very seen much in anime that much. Story overall is good. Comedy is funny and the mecha action are very exciting. I think my favorite episodes would be The 450 Million Year-Old-Trap and the Tragedy of L.

Central Park Media had released the series before and from what I've heard did not do well here. Thankfully, Maiden Japan has brought the OVA (and will bring over the TV series in July) on Blu-ray and DVD. The video quality is excellent, and looks great on my Panisonic HD TV. Audio quality is as equally good, although personally could've benefited from a 5.1 mix. The CPM English dub is on here, which is a bit disappointing as it's adaptation is horrible and some of the voices don't fit well with the characters. I personally feel MJ should've re-dubbed this, but given how well this did here the first time, I guess they didn't want to take any chances. The only extra on here is a trailer for Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, which is also disappointing because they should've included the director's commentary and English dub outtakes.

Overall, if you like mecha anime or a cop show, pick this up. For those who have the CPM DVD release, I'd say keep it unless you want the OVA to be remastered HD, then pick up the BD.

Edit: For those wondering, this is the 1988 OVA. The first of the Patlabor franchise that would be followed up by the two movies. This is not related to the TV series and the New Files.",1366675200,3,3352,4.7624784853700515

8561716,5,B00B2TUL1G,"If you keep in mind when this was made, you'll probably enjoy it, more.  The characters do seem a bit cartoonish (especially the female lead), but I think that's more a symptom of the times.  Anyway, it has good merits, and is definitely worth watching, for any mecha fans.  Definitely stick with it, because it really picks up, at the end.  It definitely has all the hallmarks of a work by Oshii.

The main reason I wanted to write this review is to applaud the video transfer.  The blu-ray release is just fantastic!  Many thanks for re-releasing this, and doing such a superb job.",1460246400,,583,4.548076923076923
