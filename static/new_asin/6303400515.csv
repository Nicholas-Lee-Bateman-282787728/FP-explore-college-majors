7845164,5,6303400515,"This is the best documentary I've seen on Japan. The film is narrated by Jane Seymour, and you even catch a glimpse of her now and then.
The film delves into the duality of the Japanese culture better than any other book or film. It discusses everything about the culture from the beauty and simplicity of Japanese art, to the violence that is ingrained in the culture, hence the name ""The Sword and the Chrysanthemum: - beautiful, yet violent.
This film will give the viewer an understanding of how the Japanese can view the most violent of films, and read the most sadistic comics, yet their culture has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.",1022630400,,649,4.555555555555555
