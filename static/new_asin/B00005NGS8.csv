8200948,5,B00005NGS8,"Two things I really really love.  Well written high school shows and British Comedy are one in this series.  It's both charming and very sophisticated.  Almost like you're hanging out with a gang straight out of Goonies or Dazed and Confused.  It's completely true to life and never sappy.  Very gritty and also with the draw of being pleasant at the same time.  Hopefully this gets to the US soon cause this has to be a hit over here.  Mostly so we can see more and more.  Take one part Freaks and Geeks mix it with a little Peep Show and trainspotting and you've got this.
