It contains rare footage of the guys in and out of the studio. Also, the DVD features an incredible live performance of Heart of the Sunrise.",1216512000,,301,4.375
8166315,4,B000M55IQE,"In The Big Dream, is a great documentary that shows intimate moments of the band at the studio with bassist Tony Levin's company. This video documentary contains footage and short interviews of every member of the ABWH band, inserted between some videos of the first ABWH album aside the live concert track ""Heart Of The Sunrise"" (taken from the DVD live concert ""AN EVENING OF YES MUSIC PLUS""), where the participation of bassist Jeff berlin is a little bit unapreciated because his tone bass doesn't sound with the power of the lines that Chris Squire used to play with the Yes group, and the almost inexistent camera takes to him on the production. Finally, another point is that the best song of the first ABWH album, BIRTHRIGHT, unfortunately is not in this video. Why?...but whatever it is, this is still a great documentary for the neophyte or the Yes fan... Good Luck!",1166745600,4,876,4.769736842105263
