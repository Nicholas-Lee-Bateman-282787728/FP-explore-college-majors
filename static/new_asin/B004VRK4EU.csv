4484320,3,B004VRK4EU,"This could have been a really good movie, I liked the story line, a bit predictable but still good. The actors and their lack of acting skills made the it hard to watch at times. When you make a movie, spend a little more on quality actors, the audience will appreciate it. Comparing this movie to Christian movies like Soul Surfer, Courageous and Fireproof, all I can say is it's an ""ok"" movie. I would have given it just 2 1/2 stars if I could.",1355097600,,446,4.258823529411765
4484321,1,B004VRK4EU,"I was expecting an enjoyable film, along with some cycling.  It's actually a terribly scripted & poorly acted film attempting to get by on religious wholesomeness.  Not a film you'll want to own.

(Apparently filmed in northern Ohio, with scenes at Marblehead & Kelly's Island, and featuring Ohio Amish and Miller's Ferry boat.)",1353715200,2,328,5.150943396226415
8443922,4,B004VRK4EU,"Somewhat predictable plot with novice actors, but a watchable movie nonetheless.  As others have said, this is a Christian-made movie for Christians, and there were times when I wondered if the screenwriter/producer had any background on cycling other than famous athletes doping in the news, but I would watch this again because it's got a good message and it's clean.  I'm well acquainted with the dark side of cycling and professional sports, so I don't need a vivid portrayal of the ugliness I know exists and even continues to thrive in some circles.  The credits read as if a giant family all pitched into get this project off the ground, but the camera work is surprisingly good for filming that must have been a (cherished) community event.",1483660800,,748,4.874015748031496

8443924,5,B004VRK4EU,"Redemption Ride was  filmed n my hometown of Bucyrus, Ohio.  My childhood friend Jim Bloomfield has 4 songs in the movie along to my grandson father. This was set up to designs a father to follow clues by his son. He must bicycle 1000 miles endind back home. I recom.end this movie to all. Love it.",1461024000,,298,4.303571428571429
8443925,3,B004VRK4EU,"OK, to watch but it is by Christians for Christians.  This is the main issue.  It doesn't go far enough and maybe it was not intended to do so.  It doesn't reach out to the world. Production value:  most any cyclist will look at his bike setup and scream with disdain.  How can a TdF pro rider go with that bike?  A closer look at Floyd Landis, Tyler Hamilton, Levi Leipheimer will tell you what these ""retired"" riders have as their bikes.  Maybe  even some TdF manufacturers would have given some assistance ($$$) to this production.",1451088000,,534,4.489583333333333

8443929,5,B004VRK4EU,"This is one of my favorite movies because I am an avid cyclist and my relationship with God is the most important relationship I have. This movie touches my soul and every time I watch it I see something I didn't see before. The message is powerful, the storyline will inspire you, and the music will move you. I always cry when I watch this movie and I absolutely LOVE it!!!... I could watch this movie over and over again and I do. I strongly encourage everyone to see this movie because it will enliven all of your senses while it strengthens your faith and reminds you how important forgiveness is. When you live in forgiveness gratitude will show up in ways you never imagined and when you live in gratitude success is the only option. ~Lisa",1423440000,2,746,4.452554744525547
8443930,1,B004VRK4EU,The best part of the movie is when the main character is just biking. Other than that there was nothing I liked about the movie.,1409529600,,128,4.16
8443931,4,B004VRK4EU,"It's a great movie that will appeal to those who enjoy pretty much everything about cycling (like me).  That said, it's not as much a cycling movie as a testimony to the work of God.

That said, though, it is a smidgen cheesy, as many non-mainstream movies tend to be. It fights against it, and does alright, but it is still not a full-production movie.

Well worth the money, though, at the price!!!!  Enjoy!",1380067200,,409,4.486486486486487
