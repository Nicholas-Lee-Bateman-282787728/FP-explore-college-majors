7131611,3,B00WFHU0BK,Informative movie on the risk of the silent killer during a woman's pregnacy.

7131635,4,B00WFHU0BK,"The movie speaks to the heart of many......trusting professionals when we know in our heart that they are not listening to us. Even harder now with HMO and PPO  telling patient what is covered under their insurance plan. This film provides an opportunity to empowerment-----ecouraging individuals to support each other and courageous fight for their own <loves ones> health.
My focus was on the message. The acting was good. The story line..others reviews have addressed the crazy decisions and lack of support from the hospital.",1477699200,,529,5.223529411764706

7131649,2,B00WFHU0BK,Cute Movie but the story line went left. Was that the only doctor in town? There is no way anyone would stay with the same doctor who dismiss obvious signs of trauma. I was surprised to see her alive at the end. I gave 2 stars because I was happy to see Miguel and they made a nice couple.,1468108800,,289,3.9152542372881354

7131652,1,B00WFHU0BK,"I don't see how anyone thought this was a good movie?!I guess it's just me,but I thought it was horrible. I can't even begin to list why it was so bad,so I'll just leave it at that.",1458777600,,181,3.918918918918919
7131653,3,B00WFHU0BK,"Wow.....I love the Love Story......but I'm super frustrated by the storyline.....
I'll start from the end.... The doctor that misdiagnosed the wife is on the review panel to determine if she should remain on life support??? And another doctor who was worried about getting into the nurse's panties/scrubs? Really?
I can't understand the decision NOT to get 2nd opinions from a different hospital and different doctors.

I blame the husband 1000% for this. HE was supposed to be the advocate for his wife and child. And he failed them when it counted.

I blame the wife 35%.....we will change hairstylists if we get a bad cut once, but to stick with a doctor who ridicules your concerns? And disrespects you in front of your husband while chewing gum? I changed my ob when I was 3 months pregnant because I SENSED that the doctor was trying to ""run"" the show and wouldn't have taken my concerns seriously. I'm so glad I did...! It saved my life and health and that of my son.

Anyway, there are a LOT of messages in this movie.....
1. Be a team. 100% of the time. Not just when you aren't opposed.
2. Be your Loved one's advocate. Don't let the medical bureaucracy cost you your life, loved ones, relationships and health.
3. Follow your gut/instincts and don't back down. Men, trust a Woman's instinct. It is usually correct.",1457740800,6,1325,4.653846153846154
7131654,5,B00WFHU0BK,Love this movie,1456790400,,15,4.333333333333333
7131655,3,B00WFHU0BK,"Very good psa movie but all those symptoms should have got a second opinion. I was yelling at the screen for the incompetence of the doctor and hint of malpractice.  First-time pregnancy i got every pregnancy book there was. Spoilers....
  glad everything worked out",1454112000,,266,5.0
7131656,3,B00WFHU0BK,"I appreciate the intent of the creators of the film. A PSA about pregnancy complications is needed, and I think for the right target audience (those who do absolutely no research and trust their doctors blindly--I'm NOT that gal), this movie may work. But my main beef without giving the story away is how otherwise intelligent characters have a serious blind spot when it comes to trusting their doctors. Early in the story, I knew what was up, but yet the doctor in the movie (I'm not a doctor) didn't? Really? Okay. That rant is over. If you like R&B, you'll like the soundtrack. If you like a love story, and love the Lord, you might get through it okay if you're willing to suspend disbelief on the medical stuff--and give grace to the acting of some of the characters (and low budget). But it felt like a big cliche most of the time.",1454112000,3,839,4.454545454545454
7131657,5,B00WFHU0BK,"Other than the cussing, this is a good story based on the family's experience.  It was an eye-opener as the quality of care some women receive when pregnant.",1452988800,,157,4.607142857142857

8713179,2,B00WFHU0BK,Just an ok movie.,1510617600,,17,3.5
8713180,5,B00WFHU0BK,"This really depicts the vulnerability of what women, especially black women go through enduring the medical profession.  Women, trust the signs of change in your body and what they are telling you which no doctor can.  In my family, the doctor tried to tell my mother and father they were crazy and at fault.  As a result, 3 siblings died before me until my dad changed doctors - hence I was born.  Therefore, we must be our own advocate and stand up to authority figures who try to diminish our importance and silence our voice.  This movie explores all of these raw sentiments and gave us a happy ending based on the real life survival story of Angel Burgin Logan being diagnosed with proclamsia throughout her pregnancy.  However, that is not the norm.",1509408000,,755,4.639097744360902

8713183,3,B00WFHU0BK,"I'm just trying to figure out why oh girl didn't just get another opinion from a different doctor... As her homegirl said, ""you know your body better than anyone else...""",1503014400,,170,4.7
8713184,5,B00WFHU0BK,good movie,1499558400,,10,4.5
