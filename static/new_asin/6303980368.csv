746611,4,6303980368,"During the early 1990's, I was doing research into mental illness and Schizophrenia.  This film is brilliant.  I've viewed it at least three times.  The confusion in Janet Frame's life proves that her, and all humans, willpower is triumphant.  Little more is known now, as to the causes of mental illness. I also viewed Benny & Joon, Shine, Angel Baby, Awakenings, and Slingblade.
More films about the unravelling of one's reality, but not necessarily mental illness, include... Crash, Moonstruck, Mask, Different for Girls, Like Water for Chocolate, Men Don't Leave, Ma Vie En Rose = *My Life in Pink*, Beautiful Life, Maurice, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, Angels & Insects, and William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet, with Claire Danes!
Most of the detainees, or clients of the mental health system fight courageously against all manners of inner and outer torments.  I own a well read copy of 'Surviving Schizophrenia' -I was given an out of print discarded library copy by a friend of my mother.",987638400,2,999,4.993975903614458
746612,5,6303980368,"A unique and original work from a gifted film artist. It tells the story of Janet Frame, one of New Zealand's most important writers. The film follows Janet's life from the time she's a small girl in school, trying to  buy friends with candy, to the adult, painfully shy introvert played by  Kerry Fox. It is an insightful look at the life of a woman who finally  learns to appreciate herself. Remarkable.",956707200,7,405,4.597222222222222
746613,5,6303980368,"As a writer I can clearly understand the world Janet Frame lived in growing up. I myself was sent to a shrink for being a writer as well as for being shy and introverted. However, this is an outstanding drama of human  proportions. It echoes forthcoming images of what Campion did with  ""The Piano"" three years after she made this film. The life of  Janet Frame is beautifully realized from her youthful days with a  lower-class family, suffering heartbreak, loss, labeled as insane, and  finding ultimate redemption in her talent as a writer. The film explores  both her personal and social conflicts as well as with the men who changed  her life and stirred her emotions. Very few writers and directors can ever  tell a story so vividly real and powerful as Campion and Laura Jones have  done here. It should offer hope and strength to those who have great dreams  of success in this life yet feel mowed down by overnight sensations and  those who threaten to tear down their goals. The music score adds to the  emotion this film evokes. The world of a writer was never more stunningly  pictured than how it is here. I highly recommend this film, especially to  my fellow writers out there in this world. It is a gem of a film from one  of the most gifted writers and directors our movie industry has ever known.",924480000,12,1314,4.555555555555555

746753,5,6303980368,"Janet Frame was an extraordinary sensitive individual without a social skin, she was socially awkward and reserved her self for creative expression in poetry, novels and short stories. She avoided giving interviews or articulating her views. She wrote of experiences that haunted her and she had many traumatic experiences to overcome in her youth : childhood in a poor family during the Depression; a traumatised adolescence( she lost 2 sisters through drowning 10 years apart); extreme shyness;troubled university years in Dunedin that led to a nervous breakdown; misdiagnosis of schizophrenia and ,unnecessarily,200 ECT treatments; fear of authority. She had courage too, writing was her salvation,words her refuge and triumph, to transcend her anxieties and grief through the therapy of art and imagination. Always a great reader.she retreated from the world and society into nature. Frame faces great difficulty in adapting to the conventional rural life around her, and her social awkwardness only worsens as she grows older. Frame's autobiographical articulation of an imaginative female mind with its wings clipped by the stultifying social conformity of 1950s New Zealand was ripe material for Campion's preoccupations: as a way to reconnect with her personal experience: ""[Frame's autobiography] awakened my own memories of my childhood; her book really seemed to me to be an essay on childhood in New Zealand.""

There are figures/events which help release her from her isolation : Money, a tutor of psychology at university; her 1st book of published stories which saves her from a lobotomy; Frank Sargeson,the writer, who allowed Janet to stay in a hut in his garden to write(1955-56),who helped her get a book published; an American professor/poet with whom she experienced 1st love; the travel scholarship which frees her to travel and experience the world outside New Zealand, beautifully captured by Campion,who pays equal attention to Frame's subsequent life, as she slowly adjusts to life in the outside world, experiencing literary success and her first romance. Expressive visuals add immeasurably to the total effect, while Kerry Fox's superb performance creates a truly affecting portrait of Frame. Impressively, the film was originally made as a mini-series for New Zealand television, and slightly reedited for a later theatrical release. Campion shows very well the thin line between creativity and madness, depicted with unsentimental honesty that veers between naturalism and surrealism. Frame, bright but intensely passive, inhabits a chaotic universe, is embodied by 3 red haired brilliant actresses, each one growing out of the one before. The film ends with Frames return to New Zealand where she is finally free to creatively nourish her solitude in a fond and familiar setting. This reminded me of Seraphine, another film where the artist ended up in a lunatic asylum. A film full of light and joy.",1435190400,2,2931,5.427631578947368

746759,5,6303980368,"I felt compelled to watch An Angel At My Table after seeing it on a list of recommended films about writers. Additionally, I feel very strongly in my soul, regardless of what some of my well- meaning critics may say, that it is part of my destiny to become a writer on the side. I intend to write and publish under an alias and/or pen name and credit countless people for inspiring me (such as a recent encouraging e-mail pertaining to authorship that I received from Sean Malarkey). Still, I found An Angel At My Table motivational because this movie centers around the true life story of a woman named Janet Frame (played by Kerry Fox) who enjoys a distinguished career as a writer despite acting different from other ladies who lived around the same time period (including her biological female family members). Sadly, she is at first misdiagnosed to be schizophrenic and almost ends up having to undergo a complete lobotomy. I must leave out how she gets out of this situation for those who have yet to see An Angel At My Table. However, from my perspective, this film captures in a humane and brilliant way the highs and lows of her life. Divided into three parts, this film captures moments such as when she first falls in love and another scene where she ends up getting romantically swept off her feet by another accomplished individual. Part one transitions into part two via the action point of her going off to college. Part two to three makes the transition of her going abroad  from New Zealand to England and then to Spain. Quotes from the Shakespeare play of The Tempest and another quote from Robert Burns of Duncan Gray are featured in the movie transitions.",1419033600,,1675,4.63973063973064

746889,4,6303980368,"I was never a great fan of Campion's movies until I began reading the benighted reviews of her movies. I'd always felt she was too emphatic, too stark in her metaphors, too obvious. Until reading reviews, especially of The Piano, Holy Smoke and An Angel at my Table.

In these movies she explores the idea of integrity, specifically feminine integrity. As opposed to the more throughly explored idea of masculine integrity. The lone hero, the against all odds, win at all costs, prove them wrong, get the cartel to the rail head, no matter what - male hero. Campion's female ""hero"" (sic. because ""heroine"" has an entirely different connotation) - are driven by their own sense of worth and value - in Holy smoke the erotic and religious mysticism are played off each other' in The Piano the erotic and musical inspiration are played off each other; in ""Angel"" an utterly unconventional and in no way conventionally sexily attractive woman is compelled to express herself through her writing, and is mis-diagnosed as schizophrenic and incarcerated in an institution.

For my taste Camion is too didactic, too direct, too explicit in her metaphors and the situations she contrives. But then I read reviews that so completely misconstrue her movies. Sometimes, perhaps, because she hits a nerve. Other times because...well...who knows?

In each of these three movies the central character is moved by strong feelings, so powerful, so personal, they drive and intensely strong need for their realization. One is through religious and mystical revelation (Holy Smoke). One is through music and piano playing and composition (The Piano) and one is through writing (An Angel AT My Table) - And in each movie there is denial and repression from an outside force, usually male, but more generally from petty bourgeois  sentiment and complacency.

For me the problem is that Campion's didactic stridency invites judgement. Positive for the heroine and negative for her repressors. But this can't be right because the victims and persecutors are of their time and circumstances. And should not be judged by ours. - Simply appreciated.

My takeaway from all three movies is that whether or not we regard the principle female as ""attractive"" or not, we should at least start by acknowledging her humanity and deeply respect her desire to realize herself for who and what she is. And despair a the smug self-righteousness to which we are all susceptible.",1413763200,,2440,5.057213930348259
746890,4,6303980368,"""An Angel at My Table"" is the story of New Zealand writer Janet Frame, based on her memoirs.  Though Campion's movie doesn't specify the years involved, the events took place in the 1930's, 40's, 50's, and very early 60's.  Like later movies of Campion's (""The Piano""), this film examines the intersection of art and repression.

The thing I find most appreciable about Jane Campion's movies is their insistence on portraying aspects of female experience that are far removed from the idealized depictions of women in most movies.  Campion depicts introversion, awkwardness, and outright geekiness in the character of Janet Frame.  The filmmaker employs an enchanting style which occasionally floods the frame with color and pattern in an effectively nave way.  In one shot, railway cars spin through the center of the frame as if they were projections from a magic lantern on a wall.  Campion is conveying the actual way that young Janet Frame perceived the world around her, tinged with imagination as the ""Grimm Fairy Tales"" that Janet absorbed and related to her own life.

At the center of the film's ""palette"" is the bright red of Janet Frame's crown of frizzy hair.  The hair becomes the obvious symbol of Frame's extraordinary nature, and her ""apartness"" as a budding artist/writer.

As the plot unfolds, Frame emerges from a hard, rustic childhood in a family where the father is a railway worker,  a young brother suffers from epilepsy, and two sisters are fated to drown in separate incidents (actually, both succumbed to heart failure while swimming).  Frame realizes early in her education that she wants to write, but she winds up becoming a teacher ( a role she dreaded, possibly because of her abuse at the hands of her early instructors).  Her teaching experience brings on a mental breakdown, which is then mistaken for schizophrenia and treated with institutionalization and shock treatments.

Campion does not dwell overly on Frame's hospitalization (this is no ""Shock Corridor""), and instead the movie emphasizes the tenacity in which the young heroine clings to her vision of writing.  The movie is sort of an essay on endurance.

It's hard to find other movies to compare this with.  Campion is a world away from David Lynch or Lars Von Trier, although she can also be called a ""surrealist"".  Looking to older movies, ""An Angel at My Table"" certainly is not the schmaltz-fest that ""Now, Voyager"" is, but it covers some of the same territory.  It also shares tangents with ""Georgy Girl"", ""Temple Grandin"", and strangely enough, ""The World of Henry Orient"" (for its depiction of young girls' fantasy games and infatuations).

This is a very remarkable film, and I'd give it five stars, except that I believe it lost a little something in the process of its being made for television, and could have been edited better.

The title of the movie is derived from a poem by Rilke, and connects to the belief of Frame's mother, who said one should never turn vagrants away when they asked for food or shelter, because ""you never know if one of them could be an angel sent to test you.""  One last note:  reading either Janet Frame's autobiography, or Michael King's biography of Frame, will greatly enhance your appreciation and understanding of this film.",1400457600,2,3270,4.948717948717949

Through Jane Campions restrained and careful telling of this story we all actually are little fat buck toothed Janet with her mop of red hair  drifting through a world no one helps her understand or find a path in.

746895,4,6303980368,"Truly haunting from start to finish, `An Angel at My Table' was certainly NOT what I was expecting.  I love (and I mean LOVE) Jane Campion.  I find her work fascinating and her ability to create such sexual tension within atmospheric beauty.  Her masterpiece `The Piano' continues to grow in my mind as the greatest film of the 90's and her recent work like `Bright Star' only further my adoration for her aesthetic and overall grace as a director.

`An Angel at My Table' is not like any other Campion production that I've seen (and I've seen them all except her debut, which until a few months ago I didn't even know existed).  Replaced by the sexually overt undertones is a grimy sense of pain and tragedy that cloaks every frame like a dirty sheet.  Intact is Campion's knack for storytelling and her impeccable work with actors and so the film feels like Campion's work and yet it oddly feel NOT like her work.

The film tells the life story of Janet Frame, famed New Zealand poet who lived a life of sheer tragedy.  She was a misfit of sorts, awkward and distanced and because of her demeanor she was assumed schizophrenic and suffered at the hands of misdiagnosis's that threatened her health and emotional wellbeing.

Starting from her early adolescence and moving on into her young adult life, `An Angel at My Table' gets us intimately acquainted with the quirky yet endearing nature of Janet Frame.

 I did find the film a little uneven in parts and slightly incoherent in moments that didn't seem to explain themselves fully and so I found myself struggling to put pieces together that should have been easier to understand.  This isn't an issue that majorly dampens ones viewing experience, as those moments do work themselves out and with a little concentration one can find the missing pieces, but it was an issue that was present nonetheless.  Honestly, it may have been more of a cultural barrier that proved the problem (accents and cultural differences getting in the way), so it may not even be a fault of the film but more a fault of the viewer, if you get my drift.

At the heart of this film are three stunning performances that help flesh out this intricately interesting woman.  Kerry Fox shoulders the bulk of the emotionally arresting material, for she portrays the adult Janet Frame, but it was Alexia Keogh who stole the show for me with her truly organic portrayal of a young child coming to terms with her awkwardness.  She really delivered every line with such authenticity, and in scenes of emotional turmoil she found a way to be moved without betraying the distance in Frame's frame of mind.  Karen Fergusson was also well used, albeit to less memorable effect; but truly it is the trifecta of these performances that makes this film so engrossing.  Without each actress doing her utmost to develop this woman, the film would have been stagnant and lost within it's own ambitions.

Yes, `An Angel at My Table' is an ambitious feat (originally released as a television mini-series, the film exceeds two hours and spans a great deal of time), but it is a feat worth admiring because Jane Campion is most capable of making this a work of art.  While it is overall not as strong as Campion's best work (`The Piano', `Portrait of a Lady', `Bright Star') it contains far better plot development than her weaker efforts (`In the Cut', `Holy Smoke') and certainly lives up to her name.",1313452800,,3411,4.691275167785235
746896,5,6303980368,"I suppose since this movie was originally made for Austrailian TV it never has achieved the status of some of Campion's other films, notably THE PIANO.  It is, however, arguably her most personal, if only for one touching moment when Janet (the protagonist) steps into her dead father's shoes.  Always a visualist, Campion exceeds herself here by connecting all the generational dots with ""episodic visuals"", relegating dialogue to explanatory purpose, the ""written"" word (she's a writer) taking on even greater importance.  Stunning when it's at its most understated, An Angel At My Table is a absolute MUST for any Campion fan, and a definte ""go"" for the discriminating moviegoer.

746897,5,6303980368,"Jane Campion's ""An Angel At My Table"" recounts gorgeously the not atypical but curiously individual tale of New Zealand author/poet Janet Frame.  Anyone familiar with her unfairly obscure work will consider this epic a long time coming.

I imagine it must have been difficult for Campion to film the life of an author as inner directed as Frame (even her autobiographical work has as little to do with the outward world as Joyce or Beckett) but she pulls it off, and in spades.  Born to a working class family in Australia, her father a railroad worker and mother a stay at home Mom (who at one time served as a housemaid for writer Katherine Mansfield), Frame's childhood is depicted beautifully with a magical realist style she would become famous for.  Frame's instinctive sympathy for outcasts of society, the disabled, alienated, and mentally ill serve as a kind of omen for things to come.  Toddling around like a mini Raggedy Ann with a briefcase that she could probably fit in, her sassy sister watches her awkward plight through life with a deep empathy and slight lack of understanding.

Janet felt most comfortable at home with her books, typewriter, and all her siblings around. Her first trip to college was, predictably, a complete disaster.  Kerry Fox does an astounding job portraying shy introvert with nervous terror whose neuroticism could was all to easily mistaken by a well meaning teacher of Literature who mistakes a lack of hygiene for schizophrenia.  His lies all too easily woo the young Janet into viewing her non existent mental illness as something romantic.  ""Van Gogh, Blake, you are in their company, Janet!""  He brings a team of doctors into her dorm room with the suggestion that she ""go somewhere to get some peace and quiet.""

Many critics portray this movie as nothing but trama and misfortune from beginning to end simply because of this sequence of events.  There are heartrending scenes in which this brilliant young woman (after having her bad teeth removed) is subjected to electroshock therapy.  Though Frame endured over 200, this is only shown *once* (and that's enough).  The scenes in an old school mental asylum are enough to make one want to reach through the screen and strangle the doctors.  I'm sure theatrical pioneer and *real* schizophrenic, Antonin Artaud, would have had quite a bit to say about this film.

Janet is nearly given a lobotomy.  Had a week passed without the news that she had just won a literary award and been a nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature, this probably would have occured.

The rest of the movie is an exquisitely filmed and perfectly acted sequence of events in which the young Janet, despite her occasional depressions and hyper-fearfulness of the outside world, triumphs.  The failure of the mental health system does not prevent her from self realization.  Encouraged by a bohemian friend to milk her very real troubles for all they are worth, she receives unemployment and gets to do what she likes best: read and write.  The only flaw in the entire film--and it is long, never losing speed for a moment--is a consistently negative characterization of the Irish.  One is in a illiterate peasant and the other is a young poet who nearly impregnates Janet after drawing her into the first intimate relationship of her life.  Then he leaves her.

Poems read aloud, literature made life, and the triumph of the written word and imagination are the ultimate message of this movie.  The bonus features, which include a real interview with Janet Frame, are great as well. Skip ""Bright Star"" and see this instead.",1262649600,6,3600,4.891268533772652
746976,5,6303980368,Jane Campion offers a well crafted inspirational look at the fortitude of the gifted writer Janet Frame. Beautifully filmed and well acted.,1246665600,,139,5.363636363636363
746977,5,6303980368,"The story of Janet Frame is not a happy one.  As I look through the shelves of books that I have within my home, I notice that the stories I have of theirs are not of the happiest nature.  Most biographies tend to go in a direction that pushes the reader into a darkened realm, a world that would otherwise be unknown to them, to bring a reader into a level of pity, remorse, or sadness for whomever they are reading.  Janet Frame has had a very troubling life beginning with a life of poverty, a lack of romance, a misdiagnosis of illness, and finally a family death.  She is a socially inept person, never willing to stand out in a crowd, but would rather shove her nose in a book, and write powerfully about the world around her.  Her life has been chaos, but she has overcome, challenged herself, and prospered into the writer she is known today.  With this said, when the option of bringing Frame's life to the bigger screen blossomed from thought, who better to helm the project than the woman who brought us ""The Piano"" and ""In the Cut"", Jane Campion.

Campion's work throughout the years has been inspirational, dark, moving, and powerful.  Her ability to bring characters alive through words, actions, and emotions cannot be matched by many directors in Hollywood today.  For this critic, her work is reminiscent of a female Lars von Trier, in which her ability to bring these larger than life characters out of their shell transforms them into darkened characters which evoke inspiring (yet saddening) events.  As I watched ""An Angel at my Table"", I was reminded of Bess' journey with her husband, and consequentially her life, in Trier's ""Breaking the Waves"".  Campion, without a doubt, is a director that stands on her own two feet and this film is pure example of that.  To begin, Campion's direction is flawless.  This is nearly a three-hour long biography of Janet Frame's life from young girl to the author she became.  For some directors this may create an opportunity to enhance other characters, to trivialize smaller events so that we can do bigger things, or to just push along, very slowly, until we all nod off from boredom.  Believe me; I have sat through my fare share of stunningly dull biopics.  Campion proves she is better by breaking the film into three segments (three parts of Frame's autobiography), giving us amazing imagery coupled with a brisk pace that doesn't loose any of its translation or excitement.  Her use of colors, the boldness of Frame's red hair, the powerful background of New Zealand (and eventually Europe) challenges us to pay closer attention, giving us not just a story worthy of our minds, but also our eyes and heart.  The colors also provide a vivid counterpoint to the harsh realities of what Frame faces, her fears and her erroneous placement into hospital.

I thought this film was flawless, thus I can continue to babble on about how much I enjoyed Campion's film technique and style.  She allowed us to make our own decisions on Frame, but also filmed in a style that never cramped our viewing space.  We were never forced to just focus on Frame, but we did because Kerry Fox gave us this pure, uncut portrayal of Janet Frame. Due to this originally being filmed for New Zealand television, I can only assume it eliminated Fox from being nominated for an Academy Award, but she 100%, who heartedly, hands-down deserved it.  Her performance, from someone I had never seen before, was phenomenal.  She literally transformed herself into this character, every step that Fox took on screen she was taking it in the way that (we can only assume) Frame would do it as well.  What I am trying to say is that while I never saw Janet Frame herself, Fox never went out of the character we were first introduced to.  Fox's Frame grew with each frame, exposing herself differently to us and giving us a new side of her each time.  Again, I am drooling on myself, but ""An Angel at my Table"" is one of those films that should be watched by film students eager to learn how to get into the mind of their characters.  This would prove to them that there is more than just what is written on the page, and fully demonstrating how to bring a soul into a man-made story.  Kerry Fox was everything you wanted to see on screen, she was emotional, sensitive, caring, unquestionably curious, scared, and yet completely and utterly human.  Coupled with Campion's direction, the two take what could have been a bland film and transformed it into one of the greatest performances over the past 20 years.

For what other reasons should you watch this film?  If you aren't as impressed with the direction or Fox's performance, Criterion packs the DVD with plenty of bonus features, but as well as an amazing transfer.  The sound, the music of Frame's life, is breathtaking.  It accompanies the vision and Fox's actions perfectly.  The song sung by the sisters on the beach of New Zealand still remains with me today, nearly four days after my viewing of this film.  The other actors are very good in this film, alas; I cannot say anything further because my focus was entirely captured on Kerry Fox.  Yes, she was that amazing.  The bonus features on this disc, as mentioned before, are great to learn more about how Campion directed this film as well as her thoughts via an audio commentary.  In essence, the Criterion release of this film is the only way to watch this.  It is a flawless disc for a flawless film.  I am excited and proud to have this within my catalogue of films.

Overall, in case you haven't been paying attention this entire time, ""An Angel at my Table"" was nothing short of perfection.  When I raise this film up to other biography based films, there isn't one that compares.  Campion's work continues to impress as she grows, developing her strengths in other genres, and pushing actors to new limits beyond what we expect, i.e. though battered by critics, see Meg Ryan's performance in ""In the Cut"".  ""An Angel at my Table"" has a perfect blend of score, outstanding visuals, enthralling storytelling, and again, this powerful ability to control her actors and expect nothing less than their best.  Kerry Fox should be studied by students in this film, Campion's direction glides this actor from scene to scene, but Fox carries it all on her shoulders, with pride and with power.  This was not an easy film to create, but with Campion and Fox behind the helm what could have been a very dull, overly dramatic biography on the great Janet Frame, transformed into this staple of modern cinema, a map (so to speak) for others who wish to create films based on real people - ""An Angel at my Table"" would lead you straight to the gold.  Watch it.  Be impressed.  Than watch it again.  Rinse, wash, repeat.

746979,4,6303980368,"""An Angel at My Table"" (1990) made by Jane Campion is a true life-story of Janet Frame (1924-2004), New Zealand's most famous author. The film starts with young Jane, a funny -looking red haired girl, shy and quiet who knew too well that she was ""poor, smelly, and unpopular"". Then it follows her to misdiagnosis of schizophrenia and more than 200 electroshock treatments in a mental hospital where she had spent eight years and a severe, lifelong shyness that was her only problem. Even in the hospital she was writing and was able to have her book published - writing did save her from losing her mind. The film is based on three of her memoirs, ""To the Is-land"", ""An Angel at My Table"" and ""The Envoy from Mirror City"".

Jane Campion made a very affecting and quietly powerful portrait of a writer who also was a gentle and genuinely humble woman. The film is never a sentimental manipulating story of a talented but misunderstood artist. It does not idealize Frame but it is a very honest and sympathetic portrait of an artist.",1156896000,9,1031,4.633879781420765
746980,5,6303980368,"Writers, take note: Here is a very, very rare example of the creative spirit--and the creative process--captured on film. This story of the formative years of Janet Frame, New Zealand's most celebrated poet and novelist, is fascinating from start to finish.

Director Jane Campion's great achievement (aided immeasurably by three marvelous actresses playing Janet Frame at various ages) is to bring to a wide audience a sense of what it is like to be a creative artist. Watch Janet throughout her odd, harrowing, uplifting early years, and you will see the evolution of a true genius, a human sponge who soaks up all her experiences (good and bad) and converts them into gorgeous words. Rarely has a film been able to illustrate this so convincingly.

I recommend this film to anyone interested in the nature of genius. But for writers, in particular, it is required viewing.",1151452800,5,875,4.986301369863014

746982,5,6303980368,"This movie broke my heart in pieces the first time I saw it. I haven't been informed about Janet Frame's life before and this movie based on her autobiographies gave me the big picture that I find it too difficult to put it out of my mind.
Janet is lovely girl by all means, generous and caring to her friends, she has crooked teeth in her younger days but she was always an owner of a diamond heart. She was painfully shy too, and God knows how stupid people judged her as schizophrenic in the best days of her life. It was so scary to see stupid people
diagnosing a genius as schizophrenic when it was them who should
have been diagnosed like that. Anyways,they took eight years of her life, best part of her life in hospitals with real mentally ill people. It's a wonder how did she manage to stay sane in those circumstances but she did.
Today, Janet Frame is an old woman and I hope with all my heart that people will award her with a great world prize for the long eight years she spent in hospitals when nothing was wrong with her. She absolutely deserves some recognition as long as she's still alive.
She has written so many books apart from her autobiographies and I love her with all my heart for setting a great example to humanity that GOOD PEOPLE will ALWAYS TRIUMPH (un)fortunetaly in the long run that is.
A must see movie.",1067817600,12,1339,4.338645418326693
746983,5,6303980368,"Based on the autobiographies of  Janet Frame. And from director Jane Campion (The Piano)
This is a wonderful portrait of the New Zealand author. Who was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic, she endured numerous treaments  of electric shock therapy (over 200!) Spent eight traumatic years in a mental institution. And came very close to having a lobotomy!
It would be years before she would find the diagnosis of schizophrenia was wrong.
This movie examines Janet's early life to adulthood. A very hard childhood hampered by poverty. And many tragedies. Her older sister, Myrtle, drowned when Janet was young. One of her other sisters Isabel died (also by drowning!) when Janet was in college. And her older brother suffered from epilesy. In a time when there was not more they could do about it. He often had seizures, made him a vulnerable target for bullies at school, and it left him unfit for most work. And Janet herself suffered with terribly painful decaying teeth, she had to have ALL of them pulled at a very young age.
After her thankful release from the hospital she then went on a trip, first to England then to Spain. Where she met a young American poet, who she would formed her first relationship with.
It is a long film, but don't let that discourage you. There is never a dull moment. It's a facinating story. It's visually beautiful. Filled with tragedy but also funny and wonderfully touching moments. And the performances are fabulous. About an incredible woman who wasn't schizophrenic...just ""different""
It's always remained one of my favorite films, the kind I can watch over and over.",1028937600,30,1602,4.907749077490775

Now that I have bought it and watched it again, I was once again completely wowed by the acting, the portrayal of a time, and the struggle of a person of great talent to make her way.  You laugh, you cry, you feel outrage and wonder.  This is one of the best films I have ever seen - and Jane Campion's first major hit film.  Janet Frame has a memory like Nabokov or Fellini, but from working class New Zealand and struggling with painful introversion and psychiatric misdiagnoses.
