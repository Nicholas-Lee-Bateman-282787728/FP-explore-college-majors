8444421,5,B004W4P1DG,"I've been waiting a long time for this movie to become available for Region 1 DVD players.  Audie Murphy is perfect in this role and I don't understand why it isn't available.  As much as I like James Stewart, Audie Murphy's small stature makes the story much more believable than the James Stewart version, ""Destry Rides Again"".  Whoever owns the rights to this movie, please release it for Region 1 asap.",1507507200,,406,4.690140845070423
8444422,5,B004W4P1DG,"RELEASED IN 1954 and directed by George Marshall, Destry is about a tough Western town run by corrupt local mogul Decker (Lyle Bettger) and the Mayor whos in league with him (Edgar Buchanan). They appoint a drunk as the new Sheriff (Thomas Mitchell) because they know hell be easy to control, but the Sheriff hires as his deputy the out-of-town son of an expert lawman for whom he used to work (Audie Murphy). Unfortunately, when Destry (Murphy) comes to town he quickly becomes a laughing stock because he refuses to even carry a gun!

The film is a remake of Marshalls 1939 hit Destry Rides Again, which was a remake of the 1932 movie of the same name, a closer rendition of Max Brands novel. Marshall desired to do the film again because he wanted to do it in color and thought he could improve upon it. While most critics say Destry is inferior I give it the edge because (1.) its in color, (2.) Murphy is stalwart as the humble-yet-confident protagonist, and (3.) Mari Blanchard is hotter than Marlene Dietrich as the saloon entertainer and has the mojo to pull off the challenging role. Blanchards saloon babe of dubious character is counterbalanced by Lori Nelsons character.

Another thing I appreciate about Destry is that it supports the concept of LIMITED pacifism, which is the ideology that one should only resort to violence when theres no other recourse, after more peaceable means have been sought and proven ineffective. This, by the way, is what Christ and the early church subscribed to, as detailed in the New Testament, not the idea of TOTAL pacifism, which is the idiotic mindset that a person should NEVER resort to violence in any form, even when loved ones and innocents are threatened.

The Messiahs teaching on turning the cheek didn't refer to responding to criminal acts and, particularly, not to a law officer responding to potentially violent criminality. Slapping someone on the cheek was considered a personal insult in 1st century Near East and therefore when Jesus instructed people to turn the cheek he was simply illustrating that ignoring an insult a couple of times (you only have two cheeks) is a matter of wisdom & self-control and is a good way to stave off unnecessary strife, which effectively squelches the escalation of violence (not always, but generally speaking). It helps prevent you from being victimized by fools who want to draw you into their darkness and ruin your day (or week or life). This was nothing new at the time because the Old Testament taught the same principle (e.g. Proverbs 19:11).

THE MOVIE RUNS 95 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios, Universal City; Janss Conejo Ranch, Thousand Oaks; and Alabama Hills, Lone Pine, California. WRITERS: Edmund H. North & D.D. Beauchamp from Felix Jacksons story based on Brands book.
