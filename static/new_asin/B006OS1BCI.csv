5011006,4,B006OS1BCI,"Part way into this season, 76 year old Charles Bickford who played Shiloh owner John Grainger died forcing yet another big change at the ranch. Truth is, Bickford was a mediocre replacement for the orignal owner Judge Garth, played by the meritorious Lee J Cobb. Bickford was crusty, stiff and too old for the part.  Enter: Clay Grainger, John's brother who then took over the ranch (although John's absence was never fully developed in its explanation)
  Sometimes replacement can be a good thing and this time it was clearly an improvement.  Clay Grainger was played by none other than the venerable John McIntire who acted the role with a commanding and likeable presence. Mac had been in this position before having replaced the deceased Ward Bond part way thru the Wagon Train series.  Make no mistake, McIntire is perfect in this role. Not only that, his real life wife Jeanette Nolan plays his character wife Holly in The Virginian.
  This is truly a refreshing change, given Hollywood's obsession with westerns having only single and widowed Patriarchs and Matriarchs. Finally. A normal family(!)

The rest of the cast remains the same and the writing and production are top notch.
Season 6 is a step up from the previous year. Now only two seasons remain to make it to DVD.",1342396800,19,1282,4.848623853211009

5011008,5,B006OS1BCI,"There never was or will be a better show than ""The Virginian"". James Drury is the love of my live. I suffered and cried with him through all of the shows especially during ""Flash of Darkness"".  I have seasons 1 through 6 and ""The Men From Shiloh"" on DVD and waiting for the Timeless Media Group to come out with 7 and 8.  Who was the one that thought to change the title from The Virginian to the Men From Shiloh was a good idea?  And change everything else on top of that from the clothes to the introduction, to the music, and gave Doug McClure a big mustache.  It was such a mistake; it looked to me like they were out to kill the show.

5011033,5,B006OS1BCI,"The Virginian Season 6 was just as entertaining as the earlier seasons.  John McIntire and Jeanette Nolan were excellent as owners of the Shiloh Ranch and seemed to fit the part without any effort, as though they really did own a ranch in Wyoming. Always enjoy Clu Gulager as he carries out the letter of the law.  Of course the regulars, James Drury and Doug McClure are at the top of their game, and make this show what it was, an excellent portrayal of ranch life in the old west as we all dreamed it was.",1446163200,,508,4.28125

5011035,4,B006OS1BCI,"Although it is never explained,JOHN McINTIRE took over the part of CLAY GRAINGER because CHARLES BICKFORD died during the season. He fitted the part really well. However,for the first year,some of the scripts were really bad. I am sure that JAMES DRURY and DOUG McCLURE realized this because there were used to better quality. THE BARREN GROUND and EXECUTION AT TRISTE are prime examples of this. We suffer for DRURY and McCLURE during these two &eacute;pisodes. Once you reach midseason,things are getting better and JOE and BUCK,The VIRGINIAN and TRAMPAS's horses seems to enjoy themselves again. Somehow,it seems that the series is beginning to take it's toll and i regret this because this was the best western on t&eacute;l&eacute;vision. I will still get the final seasons but skip the last year because even JAMES DRURY didn'i like  season 9",1437004800,2,848,5.100719424460432

5011076,4,B006OS1BCI,"Here are capsule impressions from season six of ""The Virginian,"" another year of upheaval for the graying series, which still kept to a fairly high standard.

THE RECKONING -- Guest stars, Charles Bronson, Miriam Colon
Vengeance-minded outlaw chief holds The Virginian and Elizabeth Grainger captive, but his wife's near-term pregnancy complicates matters. Plucky Sara Lane butts heads with Bronson while fighting to save Colon's baby and Drury's bacon in solidly constructed episode directed by Charles S. Dubin and scored by Bernard Herrmann. Odd presence of street smart Charles Grodin, playing a taciturn, buckskin-clad heavy, isn't too distracting.

THE LADY FROM WICHITA -- Guest stars, Joan Collins, Rose Marie
Saloonkeeper conceals her past when she arrives in Medicine Bow to collect inheritance. Leisurely outing allows plenty of elbow room for spunky duo of foxy Collins and wisecracking Rose Marie, both very likable.

STAR CROSSED -- Guest stars, Tom Tryon, Lisabeth Hush, Kiel Martin
Ryker puts his badge on the line to help a still-wanted former outlaw go straight. Script packs enough twists into mild story to maintain interest. Enzo Martinelli's sun-kissed cinematography is noteworthy, as is the acting of Gulager and Tryon. Gulager was getting his fill of the TV series grind and was about to permanently remove Ryker's star.

BITTER AUTUMN -- Guest stars, John Anderson, Richard X. Slattery
Seething ex-lawman buckles his gunbelt after his wife is accidentally killed by a drunken drover whose diseased herd has Medicine Bow on edge. The flinty Anderson excels as the angry widower struggling to keep a lid on his boiling rage. Plotty episode's only other distinction is the debut of new series regulars John McIntire and Jeanette Nolan as Clay and Holly Grainger. Although the two troupers, a real-life couple, were abruptly shoehorned into the series because of Charles Bickford's failing health, they lost no time making themselves at home on Shiloh range.

THE BARREN GROUND -- Guest stars, Collin Wilcox, Jay C. Flippen
To atone for an unavoidable killing, The Virginian agrees to locate a dying rancher's long-lost daughter, who is living as an Indian. Tense buildup to final showdown atones for story lapses mostly rooted in Wilcox's stiff-necked performance. Episode is notable for surprisingly candid and self-critical comments by Drury's character, enabling a rare peek inside The Virginian's wall of reserve.

EXECUTION AT TRISTE -- Guest stars, Robert Lansing, Sharon Farrell
In a near-deserted town, gunslinger with a death wish is determined to prod Trampas into a duel. Grim story by ace TV western writer John Dunkel suggests more eerie intent than lackluster production delivers. Lansing's scarily convincing performance and creepy bits by Cyril Delevanti, Percy Helton and James Nusser offer teasing glances at what episode could have been.

A SMALL TASTE OF JUSTICE -- Guest stars, Peter Brown, Susan Oliver, John Lupton
Town treed by cowboy gang turns to The Virginian for law and order. Drury's clear reluctance to risk his neck for people with no backbones typifies episode's shrewd reliance on dramatic logic instead of frenzied gunplay. Brown, who normally played lawmen, revels in his bully boy character, and youthful, gravel-voiced James Gammon is fun to watch as Brown's top goon.

JED -- Guest stars, Steve Ihnat, Brenda Scott, Sammy Jackson
Trampas persuades old saddle partner to work at Shiloh, unaware he has become a volatile gunman spying for ranchers plotting against homesteaders. Stout acting gives routine story a big lift. Ihnat's portrayal of a bitter loner who reclaims his humanity is freshly thought out to the smallest detail, such as using both hands to grip his six-shooter. Stuart Margolin brings simmering heat to his role as an unctuous, slithery villain.

THE GOOD-HEARTED BADMAN -- Guest stars, Peter Deuel, John Larch
Elizabeth is fascinated by wounded outlaw being sought by his gang and stalked by a relentless bounty hunter. First-rate episode, written by Robert Van Scoyk and directed by James Sheldon, conjures perilous situation for Lane, McIntire and Nolan in a woolly, wind-whipped setting. Deuel is magnetic as the charming scoundrel, and Anthony Zerbe performs with his usual zeal as a slimy killer.

STACEY
Stacey Grainger grows depressed after severe arm injury that won't heal disrupts a romance. Saving his best for last, Don Quine caps unremarkable recurring role with a poignant performance in artfully crafted episode directed by Leo Penn. Attractive role for blonde beauty Lee Kroeger as Stacey's fair weather sweetheart.

THE HANDY MAN -- Guest stars, Mel Torme, Tom Simcox
Secretive drifter befriended by Trampas is suspected of being a notorious gunslinger. Crooner Torme briefly put his songbook aside for acting and writing stint, and does respectable jobs on both fronts. Torme gives an effectively muted performance as the drifter, and his script provides a nicely shaded villainous role for Simcox and bright moments for Nolan and McClure, who has seldom been more ingratiating.

THE DECISION -- Guest stars, Kenneth Tobey, Monica Lewis, Ben Murphy
Proud sheriff quits for his worried wife's sake, but chafes at his new job as a Shiloh hand. The brick-topped Tobey, best remembered as the staunch hero in the horror classic ""The Thing,"" lends seasoned authority to western story as comfortably familiar as a pair of old boots. Equally comfortable is the interplay of Drury and McClure, no less so at the end of season six than the beginning of season one.",1349913600,14,5555,5.285714285714286
5011077,5,B006OS1BCI,My western collection would be incomplete without this series.  I plan to collect all that is available. Everything about this show is increbible when I was young I forgot about the many black actors that appeared on the show. The show was definitely ahead of it's time.

Despite the coming of John Mc Intire as the new owner of Shiloh, the childish scripts of several shows and the lack of the presence of the main characters on several episodes, The Virginian and Trampas, made those somewhat boring and uninteresting. Obviously, by season six the series had passed its best years.  Still, several episodes are still top-notch and that made the investment on season 6 worthwhile.",1347235200,6,550,5.088888888888889

8502153,4,B006OS1BCI,"This season broadcast 1967-68 saw the last of Charles Bickford who died in November 1967. His last episode was a great one, where he defended a Chinese cook who was being refused a business permit by racist bigots.  The next episode had his brother Clay (John McIntire) & Clay's wife Holly (Jeannette Nolan) firmly installed at Shiloh where they were known and loved. There was no transition or explanation about what happened to the Bickford character. Midway thru the episode Holly asks her niece Liz if she'd heard from her grandfather and brother Stacey in Washington.  Stacey of course was later featured in many episodes with the new stars and even had a self titled episode towards the end of the season.

John McIntire was credited as a guest star in the next few episodes and sometimes his real life wife Jeannette Nolan was as well. At other times she was credited in the closing credits. Charles Bickford remained in the opening for several episodes. Many of these featured only Trampas, the Virginian, or Clu Gulager as Sheriff Emmett Ryker.

But soon John McIntire was shown in the opening riding into Shiloh. Clu Gulager stopped appearing in early 1968.  It is interesting to note that McIntire previously replaced Ward Bond, when he unexpectedly died, in Wagon Train seven years earlier.

Many fantastic guest stars this season including Harrison Ford, Leslie Nielsen, Mel Torme, John Larch, Virginia Christine, Peter Brown as a villian (he had just concluded the spinoff Laredo), Michael Burns as Seth in the season finale of the same name, and many others.

There were 26 episodes this season and these are presented uncut and remastered on 9 discs. Three episodes on each disc except the ninth disc has two. There are no special features. The episodes this season are not quite as good as previous seasons, but the show is still good and would continue two more seasons before being revamped for a final season as a new series called The Men of Shiloh.",1515801600,,1970,4.845238095238095
