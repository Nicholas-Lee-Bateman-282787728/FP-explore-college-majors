7960261,4,B0000640WG,"I use Primal Mind in my World Religion class. I live in an area where we have many Native Americans and this is very useful in understanding some differences between the cultures. Promotes cultural understanding. Native Land, packaged with Primal Mind is not as good.",1473033600,,267,4.955555555555556

7960263,5,B0000640WG,"This is the second time I have bought this DVD--it is so good, especially for Anthropology courses I teach, that I just had to replace it after a ""borrower"" never returned it.  It is the best illustration of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis I have seen.  ""Seeing the world through different eyes"" [a different culture and language] is a difficult concept to imagine, but this documentary does the best job I have ever seen.",1405296000,,417,4.777777777777778
