6983784,5,B00SGM38S0,"I would just like to send my appreciation for the DVD which has been serving me some weeks now. Though I have been doing yoga for quite a while, I never really understood the power of the breath, especially as a mouth-breathing asthmatic who struggled to really get to grips with the ujjayi breath in a strenuous Ashtanga practice and almost gave up on yoga because of that. Despite exploring other styles/traditions I have found that few teachers really truly teach breath over physical asana, so I have found your approach very liberating. Thank you again and I hope to practice in your studio when I visit NY this year.",1422230400,2,622,4.663636363636364

The additional commentary is so supportive, especially in the savasana practice. I deal with complex developmental trauma (think: traumatic stress endured over years versus PTSD which is usually a one-off experience) that is rife with anxiety and depression. Being encouraged and allowed to not be and not do is such a relief. Thank you for creating this exceptional practice.",1422230400,,537,5.160919540229885

My heart has found a home in your philosophy of ""only what is needed to function and experience joy"". Of all the feelings that have bubbled up in me..........strangely, the feeling of Relief seems largest right now.

6983792,5,B00SGM38S0,"Ive been doing a long time. Finally, a bout of lower lack and hip pain so severe that it made me incapable of doing even corpse pose sent me off to the doctorwho told me to STOP DOING YOGA. She recommended Pilates instead.

When I eliminated yoga, however, I realized all it was doing for me. Without it, I became too anxious to sleep at night. Pilates offered no relief. When I talked to my doctor again, she said: You know, theres more than one kind of yoga. That is how I ended up at the Abhyasa Yoga Center in Williamsburg. The instruction was exactly what I needed. The teachers modified poses to suit my body, rather than asking my body to conform to some ideal pose. The attention to breath protected me from injury and quieted my anxious mind. J., the studios owner, encouraged me to develop a personal home practice so that I might enjoy yogas benefits every day. My pain disappeared and I began to sleep again. The effects were so powerful that I wanted to introduce others to the practice. I enrolled in J.s [Abhyasa] teacher training program. Now a teacher, I am grateful to have the chance to introduce students to the benefits of J.s therapeutic, breath-centered approach. This video is great for students who want to enjoy the benefits of a gentle practice at home.",1423008000,5,1280,4.541125541125541
6983793,5,B00SGM38S0,"I have the kind of mind that likes to create negative and self-defeating thoughts if I'm anxious or going through a difficult time or maybe just didn't get enough sleep. As I've grown up and as my yoga practice has developed over many years, my process of dealing with these kinds of thoughts has changed. It's gone from simply being aware of these thoughts, to trying to talk myself out of them, to now, where my reaction is doing some ujjayi breathing.
I've truly experienced the healing, good feelings that come with this breathing. And when I take the time to add movement to that breathing -- do some twists (often in my bed or on the couch), or maybe a couple simple poses at my desk or in my kitchen, shrugging my shoulders and letting them drop, drawing my shoulders down and back and clasping my hands behind me, a forward bend -- it starts to release that tension and those thoughts. Even if I do a dedicated full practice only a couple times a week, my yoga practice is incorporated in my life enough with those simple poses here and there to have a great effect.
This yoga practice I learned from you J. has not simply changed my life, it has become an essential part of it. It helps me take care of myself and treat myself with acceptance and love and simply feel good.

This is a great yoga DVD for any level and for any amount of time you have to practice. I love giving this DVD as a gift and especially if I can't share this practice with someone in person.",1422921600,,1474,4.32129963898917
6983794,5,B00SGM38S0,"We've heard the messages, ""the pace of our lives is too fast"", ""the journey is more important than the accomplishment"", ""we only listen to our bodies when they scream"". These videos, with J.'s wisdom and guidance, provide a new challenge. Slowing down and becoming more intimate with sensations of our body and breath is a substantial challenge, and we might not like practicing it at first. Yet, for many of us, this is the practice we should practice more often. More and more people are doing to yoga because of pain. These easy to follow videos, with J.'s wisdom and guidance, provide the perfect challenge in the face of persisting pain. We might not like slowing down and becoming more intimate with our body at first. Yet, this is the type of practice we should practice as the first step to lessen pain and greater ease in our body and our life. J. Brown offers yoga that allows us to practice what many of us really need - slowing down, and listening to our breath and our body.",1422835200,,987,4.550561797752809

As someone outside the Yoga Teacher stereotype myself (teaching as The Fat Yogini in my yoga studio Body Positivity Yoga in Maple Ridge, BC), I teach very intentionally to the demographic of students that are terribly under-served by the the athletic/hard-body/aesthetic-driven teachers and studios that seem so prolific. The students who come to me are those who don't feel they fit in in a stereotypical Yoga studio and truly want, need (and appreciate) a gentler, more methodical approach to the practice.

I don't know how else to explain my response, except it was an intense felt experience of integrity.  Your work with yoga practice is so incredibly soulful and honest, and your choice to bring the integrity of your work into a form of media that is so often garish or overwrought, just touched me in a very deep way.

8698304,1,B00SGM38S0,"Can't believe I spent $25 for this dvd!  It's supposed to be for beginners as well as experienced yogis. Really?!  How so?  If you're a true beginner, with absolutely no background in yoga, this is not for you.  There's very little explanation of most postures. ie: He assumes you know what down dog, up dog, triangle (and pretty much all the postures in the dvd!) are and how to do the postures with proper alignment.  If you're an experienced yogi, you'll be soooooo dissappointed. There's only the rudimentary cues. He's basically like the teacher who ""does the practice"" while calling out the names of the postures. No detailed alignment cues, no ""aha"" moments of ""wow, when I do THIS with my back leg, I can feel length in my spine"" or any other such moments. Save your money.  I can think of only one group of people who might benefit from this: If you've been through a beginners' course, or you've been practicing for a very short time (but know the basic postures), and you'd like to practice at home, but ""don't know what to do"", this dvd could be helpful.  He leads you through a very basic class of foundation poses: sun salutations sans plank, triangle, warrior 2, side angle, bridge,  seated forward bends, etc.  If you've been practicing any length of time at all, or you're a teacher looking for inspiration, look elsewhere.  This dvd is a waste of money.",1478131200,5,1371,4.628099173553719
8698305,5,B00SGM38S0,"After birthing a child three years ago, I, like many other women, wanted to get that extra 20 pounds off that I had gained during pregnancy.  ""Easy!"" I thought, thinking back on previous (unhealthy and extreme but effective) dieting and exercise habits I had engaged in throughout my teens and twenties.  But 3 years later, after months and months of weight-loss struggles and increasingly desperate (and dangerous) attempts at getting back that pre-pregnancy body, I achieved no weight loss. What I did manage to achieve however was chronic fatigue, nutrient deficiencies, digestive issues, panic attacks, insomnia, brain fog, and depression.  I, like many people desperate to reach society's standard of beauty, broke what never needed fixing in the first place. And I lost my sense of Self in the process.  Luckily, I found a holistic practitioner who helped me to see the light and explained how all the excessive intense exercise and extreme dieting was only hurting me metabolically and would eventually lead to chronic illness and early death.  I had to make huge changes in my behavior and in my priorities.

I decided to take up yoga as a replacement for all my cross-fit and long distance running insanity.  I chose yoga for the opposite reason I had chosen all the other work outs: because I hurt my body trying to make myself ""better"" and I wanted to start being kind to myself again and cultivating a healthy relationship with who I am TODAY, not the person I am attempting to become tomorrow. I also wanted something to facilitate mindfulness and presence. I wanted to engage in a practice that would heal me.
Thus began my search for the right yoga practice....

I first purchased a Rodney Yee dvd because I heard he was THE yoga guy.  I honestly hadn't even stopped to consider the possibility that I'd get something I didn't like because I heard nothing but positive things. But what I noticed right away about Rodney's yoga instruction (as well as others') is that it lacks all the things that (I thought) yoga is supposed to cultivate- Presence, mindfulness, a letting go of ego, a meditative state, relaxation, connection with self... Rodney's practice felt rushed, forced, and frankly, kind of stressful to try and follow along with. I couldn't settle into one position long enough to even take a full breath before we were jumping into the next one. And where was the meditative component?  There wasn't one. It totally missed the mark for me. It was just some quasi yoga-on-cocaine exercise that advertised the same shallow
goals I was trying to achieve when I was running my adrenals into the ground. There was nothing restorative about it.

So back to amazon I went to search for a better yoga dvd, but this time I started reading descriptions more carefully and looking for clues about which of these dvds really captured the true essence of yoga.  I was dissapointed to find a seemingly endless array of yoga practices whose emphasis and selling points were placed on all the things I was trying to free myself from. These practitioners seem to miss the big picture about this beautiful practice and what its really all about.  So I decided to try a different search.  I typed in ""slow yoga.""  And at the top of my new search results, this gem of a dvd appeared before my eyes :)
I was immediately struck by the simplicity of its cover - the lack of advertising for ""Toning"" and ""strengthening"" and ""fat-blasting.""  The title, which is so simple and so elegant, encompasses all that yoga has the potential to offer that most videos can't seem to deliver on.  And then the description, talking about what yoga is supposed to be and what the western society turned it into, it was exactly what I needed to hear. I was convinced.  So I ordered the dvd and eagerly waited for its arrival.  I know this long explanation and back story to my review is unnecessary, but I don't care. This is not just a review, it is an expression of my deeply sincere gratitude to J. Brown for this masterpiece:

J. Brown, you my friend did not fail to deliver. After trying your practice just one time, you have touched me on a physical, emotional, and spiritual level that I have not experienced in years.  In the very first session you have allowed me reconnect with a higher part of myself that got lost in the shuffle of adult stresses and responsibilities. By the end of the first session my husband and I were both in tears and vowing to do this practice every day.  I feel a stong urge to give you an enormous  hug for creating this video. I don't know you but I'm pretty sure you are a very special person.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  For nailing it in every way.

In my amazon reviews I usually list out specifics about what I like about a product, but I just can't do that in this case.  There are no words that will do this video justice. No words to describe the state of peace and connectedness that J Brown facilitates. You're just going to have experience it for yourself :) You owe it to yourself to do this practice.

I will be paying my gratitude forward by sharing the link to this amazing dvd with everyone I care about, and will be purchasing more copies to give as holiday gifts.  This dvd is way too good not to share. Everybody deserves the opportunity to feel the benefits of a REAL yoga practice.

Namaste.

8698306,3,B00SGM38S0,I really like these workouts.  The only complaint I have is that the shorter workouts are just edited versions of the long ones.  The moves aren't any different.  If you like a variety of positions in your workouts this may not be for you.,1455580800,3,239,4.386363636363637

The body is properly heated, and every joint is thouroughly worked to increase mobility. The body of this practice will blow your mind, you will breathe deeper than you ever thought you could, you will transition deeper into poses with each breath you take.
This is a breath-centered practice, and very well done. There is no music throughtout the practice (i know, i know, i thought that too......no music?), but as i dug deeper into this practice, i fell in love with the fact that the only thing i heard was a deep quiet. There is just a bit of completion music at the very end.
I cannot say enough good about J. Brown Yoga, this dvd leaves you feeling calm, relaxed, and beleive it or not, ready for more. J will lead you through absolutely every breath, and every posture, gently guiding you, and offers modifications and how to rest between breaths.
He delivers in such a manner that you will look forward to each practice.

First of all there is short intro  and interview that are very insightful and helpful to understand J. Brown's unique approach to yoga.  He stresses it is not about striving for perfect pose, or those advanced postures, but simply to feel better on the mat and off it.  For the first time I understand how to let breathing lead me.  I love how the classes are set up. each class adds onto the previous one, so that one can learn this yoga practice step by step. so that eventually one can practice adapting the movements to fit one's body and life, rather than adapting self to fit into set routine.  Already, I am experiencing chronic tension and pain disappearing, just melting away. Highly recommend this gem of yoga dvd for beginners and experienced yoga practitioners alike. I have been practicing yoga for years and have rather large library of yoga classes. This one is so different, I doubt I will go back to others ever again.  J.
