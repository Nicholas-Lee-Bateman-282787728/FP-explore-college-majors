It's too bad A&E didn't arrange to include the two earlier b/w shows from the BBC with Douglas Wilmer as Holmes: the 1964 pilot (The Speckled Band) and the first of the 1965 series of 12 episodes (The Illustrious Client), which appeared on PAL VHS from BBC in 1996.",1262649600,,415,4.265822784810126
2547097,4,B000EZ7VFI,"The series is worth watching for the Holmes of Peter Cushing, as well as Nigel Stock's take on Watson.  The guests are unfamiliar aside from Gary Raymond and Frank Middlemass. The main flaws are the slow pace and low budget sets, as well as color, which never seems suited to the Victorian settings.
The biggest surprise here is a complete verison of ""A Study in Scarlet"", which one book claimed only had a few scenes that still existed.  The changes in the story were minor, a minus being in not keeping the first meeting of Holmes and Watson, a big plus being the deletion of the dull flashback from the book.
""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is a bit disappointing, it suffers from the two part telling and, being fairly faithful to the novel, has far too little Holmes.  Two other flaws, a cave floor creaks badly and the story ends abruptly.
""The Boscombe Valley Mystery"" wasn't one of Doyle's best and is probably the weakest in the collection here, due in part to the poor supporting cast.
""The Sign of Four"" stuck fairly close to the novel, except for the end.  Only the Arthur Wontner verison actually had the nerve to allow watson to marry.
""The Blue Carbuncle"" has the most padding to fill the time, but does feature a good scene where Watson gets a laugh at Holmes' expense after a faulty deduction.
Those who think Cushing was too short to play Holmes should reread ""The Three Students"" and ""The Abbey Grange"", where Holmes gives himself gives his height at six feet, the same as Cushing.  (Arthur Wontner was an inch shorter by the way.)
Even with the flaws this is easily the best television Holmes collection out there and is second only to the better Rathbone films.",1261785600,36,1682,4.593333333333334
2547098,3,B000EZ7VFI,"""The Sherlock Holmes Collection"" contains the only six surviving episodes of the BBC's 1968 TV series ""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes"". The great Peter Cushing stars as Holmes and Nigel Stock plays Dr. Watson. The six episodes feature five stories:

The Hound of the Baskervilles (a two-part episode)
The Sign of the Four
The Blue Carbuncle
A Study in Scarlet
The Boscombe Valley Mystery

The main reason to get this set is Peter Cushing. It's great to see him playing one of his favorite characters at the prime of his career. Cushing had already played Holmes in Hammer Films' THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES in 1959. Cushing's TV Holmes is a bit calmer
than his Hammer Holmes. The mannerisms and behaviour of the literary Holmes are still present, though.
Unfortunately the episodes themselves do not live up to the star of the series. It's obvious the BBC did not spend the money necessary to bring Doyle's stories to life properly. Most of the scenes in the episodes are indoors and filled with dialogue. It's sometimes like watching a play. The action and atmosphere of Doyle seem to be avoided due to budgetary reasons. A prime example is The Sign of Four. This is one of Doyle's best works, but here it is condensed down to a Cliff Notes version. The Sign of Four should have been a two-parter as well.
Nigel Stock does a decent job as Watson, but the supporting players in the episodes tend to overact badly. In later interveiws, Peter Cushing would express his disappointment with how the series turned out. The BBC made a total of sixteen episodes, but only these six survive, because in those days the BBC would erase or re-use their tapes!
Overall, the picture and sound quality are fine (the episodes are in color). Even though these are not the best presentations of Doyle's detective, this series is a must for Peter Cushing fans and for Sherlock Holmes lovers.",1261699200,131,1885,4.7439024390243905
2547099,5,B000EZ7VFI,"If you love Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, then you should see Peter Cushing's version of the great detective. The Hammer color version of The Hound of the Baskervilles with Peter Cushing is a well-known classic; less well known in the USA is Cushing's BBC Holmes. Cushing's 1968 BBC TV version has the same restless. twitchy manner and mental energy as Brett. Cushing is even more gaunt then the early Brett, though Cushing is not quite tall enough to be an ideal Homes. The Hammer influence is everywhere from the screenplays to the atmospheric elements, yet it never overpowers the sherlockian tradition.

I also like Douglas Wilmer's BBC TV Holmes and I hope that series will also soon be available in the USA. Cushing and Wilmer offer distinctly different yet satisfying versions of Holmes that provide a bridge between the 1930-45 Wontner and Rathbone versions and the Jeremy Brett portrayal. Personally. I think Brett is best, but they each highlight different aspects Holmes' rich character.",1261526400,11,1001,5.066666666666666
2547100,5,B000EZ7VFI,"Well done, atmospheric Holmes adventures with Peter Cushing and Nigel Stock.  I'm sorry the rest of this 60's series is lost, since I believe I read that Cushing actually did about 16 episodes for the series.  The loss is ours, but it makes having this small collection of the survivors that more precious.  If you are a Hammer Film fan then you are pretty sure of what you're getting with Cushing's performance as the master slueth.  I enjoyed his big screen turn as Holmes in The Hound of the Baskervilles, but the performance at times seemed a bit too energetic, almost too frenetic at times, as though Cushing were trying hard to point out how unusual Holmes was. In these later years portrayals, Cushing's Holmes seems to move with a slow intellectual grace that is more befitting the Detective. Nigel Stock is also a recognizable face from Hammer, and other British productions. He plays Watson very well here, using the right combination of patience and awe at Holmes' quirks and genious insites.

Picture quality is very good, and sound is likewise better than expected, with five tales told in Victorian times, and with enough suspense and humor to please any Holmes fan.",1261440000,57,1180,4.821782178217822
2547101,5,B000EZ7VFI,"This is an excellent collection and has only been released in the UK.  This listing states it is an NTSC Region 1 import, but it's not.  This boxed set is for Region 2 and 4 (and region-free, which is region 0)/PAL/UK dvd players!  Do not order unless you have a player in which to play these dvds!

It's an excellent collection. With the exception of Jeremy Brett, Peter Cushing is probably the best Sherlock Holmes (sorry all you Rathbone fans).  Although he only played Holmes for a short time, he was able to depict Holmes with the proper intensity.  However, Nigel Stock still plays Watson as a bumbling sidekick.  Too bad.

I think I read elsewhere that Peter Cushing actually did more episodes, but that the BBC lost all of them except for what's released on this set.

This has 3 discs. Disc 1: The Hound of the Baskervilles. Disc 2: A Study in Scarlet and The Boscombe Valley Mystery. Disc 3: THe Sign of Four and The Blue Carbuncle.",1232755200,,942,4.4941176470588236

2547103,4,B000EZ7VFI,"Peter Cushing (Holmes), Nigel Stock (Watson) and the rest of the cast do a commendable job bringing to life five Sherlock Holmes stories in this 3-disc DVD set.  (Peter Cushing portrayed Holmes a decade earlier when he starred in the Hammer film classic, The Hound of the Baskervilles.)  For whatever reasons, these five Sherlock Holmes stories are all that survive from the ambitious color BBC TV series.  Produced with Cushing in 1968, the screen image is 4:3 (academy) format with interiors video-taped and exteriors filmed - typical for 60s TV.  The interior scenes are in smallish sets, giving things a claustrophobic mood that works nicely for these period tales of mystery.  You'll see recognizable actors in supporting roles - some with careers that blossomed after making this series.  (BTW - Nigel Stock would later play eccentric Rupert T. Waxflatter in the 1985 film, Young Sherlock Holmes.)  The DVD set's five Holmes stories are The Blue Carbuncle, The Sign of the Four, The Bascombe Valley Mystery, A Study in Scarlet and The Hound of the Baskervilles.  The DVD set includes an engaging ""bonus"" feature that was filmed in a surviving London hotel that Arthur Conan Doyle originally used as a story setting.  Remembering its vintage, most Holmes fans should find these tales entertaining.  Enjoy!",1473552000,,1310,5.107981220657277

2547120,3,B000EZ7VFI,"This Sherlock Holmes collection by BBC are adaptations produced by British television company BBC between 1965 and 1968 starring Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes and Nigel Stock as Dr. Watson. This was the second screen adaption of Sherlock Holmes for BBC Television. There were originally 16 episodes but only 5 of them survived which are presented here:

Disc 1:
The Hound of the Baskervilles (part 1)
The Hound of the Baskervilles (part 2)

Disc 2:
A Study in Scarlet
The Boscombe Valley Mystery

Disc 3:
The Sign of Four
The Blue Carbuncle

Even though the acting is quite good and the stories are faithful to the book, the visual look and feel of the episodes (especially the interior shots) give the impression that they were shot on stage, like a theatrical play. The reason for this, I believe, is that they used standard lens instead of wide lens so there is no depth perception. The objects and the actors in the foreground appear too close to the screen and the background has no character. The lighting seems to contribute to this visual style as well. The colors have no characters either. There is almost no cinematographic work. Again, these comments pertain to the interior shots. The exterior shots are OK. These comments would apply also to Agatha Christie's Agatha Christie Hour Collection.

If you are huge fan of Sherlock Holmes (like I am), you may add this to your collection but keep in mind that visual style is almost non-existent and episodes look like stage plays. If you are looking for a definite Sherlock Holmes collection, then I would highly recommend Jeremy Brett's Granada series of Sherlock Holmes which is excellent on all accounts.",1425254400,3,1669,4.862676056338028

Cushing does a very nice job of portraying Holmes having taken over for Douglas Wilmer who did the earlier episodes in 1964 and did not want to do the second series.  Nigel Stock returned as Watson.  Although BBC went to color for this set they still rushed the productions (why Wilmer did not want to do a second series) and did not spend a lot on the sets for the interior shots.  That being that, Cushing did a nice job of portraying Holmes in fair scripts set in Victorian times that follow the original stories fairly closely.  I do not care for the updated versions of Holmes as what made his observations so profound was that they WERE done in Victorian times when forensics was NOT very much in existence.  Today a normal CSI follows the same path as Holmes but HE did it when almost NO ONE else in the world was doing it.

2547150,4,B000EZ7VFI,"Cover picture should show Ronald Howard, as the 1954-55 TV series is contained on 4 of the 6 discs in this set.  Apart from that flaw, here are a couple selling points for this set:

1-It is extremely cheap and a great value for the money.

2-It presents the complete 39 episode TV series.

3-I've purchased a number of DVDs from other manufacturers presenting the Ronald Howard TV series (Mill Creek, Madacy, Echo Bridge, etc.), and believe everything is sourced from the same poor quality prints, this included, but comparing this PopFlix release to those other ones, the video quality here seems to be just slightly better than anything previously released. If you can't get the full series on DVD from PopFlix, the Echo Bridge 4-disc set is next best, but it only provides 33 of the 39 episodes.

4-The PopFlix company did something unusual on each of the 4 discs of the TV series, by including the complete opening title, credits and theme music, then just the episode titles for the remaining episodes on that DVD.  At first I didn't like this approach, but later came to like it a lot. Although I like the memorable theme music, you don't have to sit through it when you want to watch multiple episodes and get right to the story.

The TV episodes were shown on public TV stations in the mid-1970s and the video quality seemed to be better, in my memory, than what has ever been available on VHS and DVD over the past 30 years.  The original prints must exist somewhere and it's unfortunate the owner has evidently not allowed their release so we could enjoy this great series with better video.  Until then, I really believe this PopFlix release has the best available video quality. It's not great by any means, but it's better than the rest.

I bought it for the Ronald Howard complete TV show episodes. The remaining 2 discs show several other actors' portrayals of Holmes in films of varying quality, and of course the Basil Rathbone portrayals are the best, but these are taken from public domain prints.

2547162,5,B000EZ7VFI,"Just a note to clear up some points technically speaking for all of you, since there is so much anguish about the series by the viewers.

This is from an old 1960s BBC TV series, shot the same way and with the same budget as Dr. Who and everything else done by them, these are NOT 'movies'.  This means, they were by necessity shot in the studio, on stage, with TV cameras like an American Soap Opera is done to this day.  They were recorded therefore, on one inch video tape and switched live, which is done to save tons of money on editing, and uses really good, professional, stage actors who can learn the entire script in one go, and just do it.  When exteriors and locations are required they use a film camera, probably 16 mm, to film those scenes, again, like on Dr. Who and everything else the BBC TV networks need to do.  If it were not for this technique you would not have had any of this sort of television in England at all.  They could NOT afford to film all there TV series like we have always done here in commercial America.  The British taxpayers and the TV set licensing system they use actually pays for the main costs of production.  See what I mean?  So don't compare these types of shows with full budget feature motion pictures, or even American commercial TV series, which are shot on 35mm film and edited for air.  This is theatre in the true sense.

I encourage you to get this series because they have added a bonus feature which is VERY expensive to buy on its own direct from A&E Biography, the 1995 documentary on Holmes produced on the death of Jeremy Brett that year.  It is really good, and we show it at our annual Holmes Society meeting each January 6th, Holmes' birthday.  A&E charges upwards of $30 for this doc  (if you can find it); it's about 16 years old now.

2547168,3,B000EZ7VFI,"This UK PAL collection assembles several of the BBC's takes on Doyle's great detective over the years, from Peter Cushing (though not, sadly, his predecessor Douglas Wilmer) to the more problematic modern productions with Richard Roxburgh and Rupert Everett and an intriguing drama from David Pirie.

Despite huge success on its initial run in 1968, only five of Peter Cushing's sixteen BBC adaptations that saw him resuming his role as Sherlock Holmes (who he had previously played in Hammer's superb Hound of the Baskervilles) are known to exist and are collected here. As with so much popular TV of the era, the others were wiped to save storage space or to reuse the tapes, so it's perhaps a little unfair to judge the whole series on these stories, which are distinctly hit and miss.

As such the show is certainly worth a look, but the surviving episodes veer more to the average than the inspired and don't encourage a second viewing. No extras.

It's easy to tell where the 2002 version of The Hound of the Baskervilles goes wrong because so little goes right. There's little fault with the script, which does a decent job of retelling a by now overly familiar tale and even throws in an intriguingly gothic Christmas Eve party for good measure. Some of the supporting performances are fine - John Nettles and Richard E. Grant in particular. But the leads are so very wrong that they sap the life from the thing.

Ian Hart's Watson is surly and obnoxious, all too easily offended and trapped in a deeply distrustful relationship with Holmes. Since Watson has to carry much of the drama, this keeps us at arm's length from involvement, especially since Matt Day is such a dull Baskerville. However, where Hart is a good actor giving a misjudged performance, Richard Roxburgh gives every indication of being a bad actor giving a bad performance. He may not quite be the worst Holmes in the way that he was definitely the worst Dracula (in Van Helsing), but he's certainly the dullest and blandest despite his overstated distance and eccentricities, while the attempt to make him more of an action hero simply ends up making him a very ordinary figure instead. With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle.

Although David Attwood's direction throws up the odd good bit of composition, the grotty lighting and perpetual green tint on the original TV broadcast version sap any signs of life before they can bloom. And the less said about the shoddily animated CGi hound the better - despite the impressively populated London street scenes, it's hard to believe that this is probably the biggest budgeted version since Rathbone and Bruce strode the Moor.

The BBC have previously had good luck with the tale - both their Peter Cushing and Tom Baker versions, studio-bound though they were, were more involving in their cosy Sunday teatime way. Sadly, this attempt to bring a more modern aesthetic, while marginally better than the dreadful Peter Cook and Dudley Moore spoof, is nonetheless a very poor show indeed. Extras include audio commentary, cast and crew interviews and making of featurette.

After that crashing disappointment, the producers took a positive step in replacing the truly dreadful Richard Roxburgh as Holmes. Unfortunately, Rupert Everett is only a mild improvement in Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking. Less of a crashing ham than Roxburgh, instead he comes across as a rather narcissistic and disinterested confirmed bachelor rather than a master detective, constantly striking brooding poses but never once convincing that there's either a human being or a brilliant deductive machine beneath them. Always an extremely limited actor, he brings little to the part beyond a reminder of how desperately uninteresting an actor he is when given centre-stage.

Thankfully, Ian Hart's Watson has been retained and improved, and he's given a much better part than the moody, petulant and antagonistic reading in Hound. Similarly, the ill-advised mutual distrust and barely submerged hatred grafted onto Holmes and Watson has been dropped in favour of a relationship more akin to the cut 'Case of the Upside Down Room' section of Billy Wilder's The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, with Watson trying to save his friend from his drug addiction by interesting him in a baffling case (unfortunately they have also carried over Robert Stephens' horrendous white-as-a-corpse makeup job for Sherlock).

The case itself isn't overburdened with originality, at times playing like a more refined Dario Argento giallo without the gore as Holmes is drawn out of a drug binge to find the fetishistic killer of several aristocratic young girls, but it moves along at a decent pace and makes for an entertaining if undemanding 99 minutes despite an abundance of anachronisms and an overuse of the fog machine to hide the lower budget. It's just a shame that once again they've come up short one Sherlock. The only extra is an audio commentary by Simon Cellan-Jones and Elinor Day.

David Pirie's postscript to his superb but all-too-short-lived Murder Rooms: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes series, 2005's The Strange Case of Sherlock Holmes and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, unfortunately only available in this set is not essential, but it is a fascinating addition to the canon that melds the real life of Doyle with the fictional one he created and grew to hate with an impressive ambition the production isn't always able to match until the strong last half hour. It sees the author (Douglas Henshall) at the height of his fame and of his disillusionment and growing hatred for what Sherlock Holmes has come to represent in his life: Doyle's readers believe in Holmes and find him more real than the grief-and-conscience-stricken author. Desperately attempting to make contact with the `other side' as he tries to come to terms with the fact that his father died alone while Holmes was mourned all over the world and determined to kill off ""my detective"" once and for all, he's persuaded by his publisher to work on a biography with a ghost writer of sorts (Tim McInnery). But as the biographer uses some of the great detective's own methods and emphasises that Holmes is more than the mere calculating Doyle claims, he cuts a little too close to the quick for the author's comfort, uncovering the way his creation was born of guilt and pain and secrets...

Only broadcast on the BBC's digital channels rather than given a terrestrial airing like its predecessor, it has problems - it's disappointingly shot on rather bland digital rather than the film of Murder Rooms and boy can you tell the difference, other than Sinead Cusack as Doyle's mother the females roles (Saskia Reeves, Emily Blunt) are very under-developed, Brian Cox is no Ian Richardson in his couple of scenes as Professor Bell (you also get the ever-popular Sign of Four watch scene again in a different setting), and the final twist is a bit predictable, but it'll still have you gripped long before one very real character movingly tells another ""Of course you can feel me. I am your heart."" Well worth a look, but unfortunately I had to return three copies of the UK DVD before getting one that would play, and even then not perfectly.

2547170,4,B000EZ7VFI,"A&E's release of what they call the surviving 5 episodes of the BBC-produced 1960s color Sherlock Holmes starring Peter Cushing is odd for several reasons.  The first is that A&E released it on DVD instead of the BBC themselves, through their BBC/2Entertain branded DVD line.  Secondly, the package actually contains SIX 50 minute episodes, since The Hound of the Baskervilles is a two-parter.  The episodes themselves are characteristic of BBC video/film productions of the time, with the inherent occasional video dropouts and abrupt cutting between video and film shots.  Frankly, they look far better than I expected given the BBC's usual treatment of its old programs.

Regarding the performances: Peter Cushing was, by all reports, a polite and gentlemanly man--as is his Holmes.  If you are looking for the abrupt and occasionally impatient man of action found in the Doyle canon, you will be disappointed.  This Holmes is so well-mannered and neat that you cannot imagine him falling victim to the lackadaisical debauchery of a consulting detective between cases.  The very idea of this dapper and upright Holmes mixing a 7% solution for his needle is laughable.  Cushing's gentlemanly portrayal is always enjoyable, if occasionally silly.  One particular scene springs to mind where he is handed a series of objects to examine and politely thanks the giver after receiving each and every one.  Nigel Stock's portrayal of Dr. Watson can best be understood if we imagine a line graph where Basil Rathbone's crony Nigel Bruce represents the bumbling end and Jeremy Brett's David Burke/Edward Hardwicke represent the serious end.  Stock falls precisely in the middle.  His Watson is occasionally bumbling and played for comic effect (in four out of six episodes) and serious and brave (in the two-part Hound of the Baskervilles).  As with Cushing's performance, Stock is relentlessly likeable.

What else to say?  As with many versions of Holmes, these adventures contain enough burning tobacco to make even the viewer sick from secondhand smoke.  Perhaps that was why London was so darn foggy back then.  But I digress.  The episodes have the occasional awkward moments and unusual directorial choices--probably a result of limited budgets.  Almost everyone knows the point in Hound of the Baskervilles where a lamp in an upstairs window signals to someone across the darkened moor.  This is the only production to my knowledge that does not even show the other person signaling back.  The characters just claim he is and look off screen.  You could almost imagine a BBC accountant punching an old fashioned adding machine and tut-tutting ""No--You can't show a light on the moor.  It'll cost an extra 80 quid for the process shot!""  Another instance has Holmes and Watson, obviously garbed for the 1890s, trailing a clue along what very much appears to be a 1960s street.  Did they really use window treatments like that in the 19th century?  But I digress again.

The sole extra is an episode of A&E's Biography of Sherlock Holmes minus the Biography credits.  I guess A&E couldn't get the rights to their own credits (perhaps they belong to BBC video--okay, maybe not).  In any case, the episode is filled with common facts about Holmes, yet remains fun for the sequences where David Burke reprises his Watson character to attend a dinner with the London Sherlock Holmes Society.  The head of the society makes a nice speech admitting Holmes is not real and then turns things over to his real but fictional guest Dr. Watson.  Do not think about the proceeding too long or your head will hurt.

The episodes are largely faithful to the stories and the series is constantly enjoyable viewing.  The above caveats and deprecations aside, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  Highly recommended!",1285372800,4,3790,5.048309178743962

Once your jaded, 2010, everything 3D and CGI minds adjust it is fine.  The transfer itself is very clear and clean cut.

The stories and acting are what matter here and each episode holds your interest and just to see Peter Cushing play as Holmes is worth the price of admission.  He takes command and demands your attention in every scene.  Nigel Stock is a capable Watson and along with the Wimer series recently released, provides a nice bridge between seasons from '64/65 to '68.  From a Sherlock Holmes fan POV, this is a must own and a part of Sherlockian history.

2547172,4,B000EZ7VFI,"4 Stars, may be generous, as this is a rather dated, studio bound version of some Holmes classic mysteries.
However, if you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes, or more importantly in this case Peter Cushing, it's a small price to pay for a collection of made for TV episodes that shine with his talent.
I have long considered Peter Cushing to be one of England's finest character actors, although his exposure here in the US may be limited to his portrayal of Grand Moff Tarkin in Star Wars, or in re runs of the classic Hammer Horror Films of the 60's and 70's
There were originally 16 episodes of this BBC TV series made, of which I'm told only 5 or 6 remain (5 being included here). This was do mainly to money shortages at time or production, and film being re used or ""taped over"" to make new episodes.
The budget constraints are also plain to see in the production. Most of the episodes are shot indoors with minimal location shots, and the set design and finished episodes can hardly be regarded as lavish. A lot of people watching this for the first time will undoubtedly be disappointed, especially when comparing it to the phenomenal portrayal of Holmes by the late Jeremy Brett many years later.
This remains however classic in it's own right, chiefly as a vehicle for Cushing. As always, his acting is intensely focused, and almost meticulously driven on screen, as if he were born to play Sherlock Holmes (as he did succesfully in the full length hammer movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/dp/B000062XEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a>)
Despite the almost play like scenery you believe he is Conan Doyle's creation on screen, articulate, intelligent and focused without ever being overplayed or ham.
Some of the episodes suffer from a ""skipping through"" feeling compared to the books, again no doubt due to filming time and budget constraints, but Peter Cushing (at least for me) remains as one of the greatest actors to play Holmes, only Basil Rathbone, and the aforementioned Jeremy Brett rate higher.
It's a real shame only these few episodes remain, but it is worth seeing acting in it's fullest sense, without the need for a cast of hundreds, or masses of special effects. A True Classic British TV series. Enjoy!",1284076800,5,2329,5.036269430051814

Alas - only 5 episodes of it survive. But they're all here, and the videotape transfer looks good.
The rest is a mixed bag. The acting is good, especially Cushing's very fine interpretation of Holmes. However, the production value is a trifle lacking. From being shot on video instead of film, to the occasional flub (microphone hanging down in Hound of the Baskervilles -- oops!), these episodes have the feel of watching a play instead of a TV series. That said, the rest is pretty strong. This series is often pointed out as the blueprint for the excellent Jeremy Brett series, and honestly there are a few shots in here, particularly in A Study in Scarlet, that bear an uncanny resemblance to the latter series. In spite of its few shortcomings, this set is highly recommended.",1283990400,,848,4.66
2547174,1,B000EZ7VFI,"I had never seen the original BBC series, but as a big fan of both Sherlock Holmes and Peter Cushing, this looked like a natural hit.  What a shock as the first episode opened.

I could not believe it. It was worse than bad - it was terrible.

Some of the other reviewers have delicately hinted that costs were minimized, corners were cut.
They are exercising the famous art of understatement. These are the worst productions I have even seen coming from a major (BBC??????) production house. I have seen much better produced student films.

It was not quite at the level of ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" but it came frightfully close.
The problem is not just the lack of richness in the sets or the costumes (although you can see they went the cheap route). It is the technical aspects of film making that were almost totally botched.

You know - the nuts and bolts that if done right are not even noticed by the audience. Things like; What camera angle was chosen, how the sceen is lit, what exact movement directions are given to the actors, that sort of thing.

I'll grant that the sound is decent, but the lighting and camera work are unbelievably bad. If you have any appreciation for the basic elements of good cinematography - you will find most of them missing here. The camera work is just plain bad. Poor angles, bad framing and rough movement following - the entire gambit.

The Directing was terrible, in every aspect. Peter Cushing does a decent job with the role, somehow, but one get's the feeling he's not happy. Niegel Stock does a worksman-like job as Dr. Watson but most of the rest of the acting makes you cringe. Now England produces a wonderful crop of good actors each year - the country is overflowing with good actors. Most of the blame on these pitiful acting performances must lie with the director,who is telling the cast what he wants them to do.  I don't think there are that many bad actors in England.

Now some have commented on the play like appearence of the produciton (and that feeling comes through quite strongly). But it is a badly produced, badly directed, badly acted play. And it's transition to film (video) horribly botched.

I almost gave it two stars because I really enjoy Peter Cushing's work - and boy did he have his work cut out for him here. But I must strongly counteract the suggestions that this is in any way good stuff. I am amazed at the
generous ratings given.

In sharp contrast, and to properly illustrate the depth of the shortfall - watch the well produced, well directed, brilliant acting in a British production like a Jeeves & Wooster episode or any episode of Unstairs/Downstairs. See how a well directed cast performs -even the supporting actors do splendidly. See how seemlessly the camera moves and handles the action. You get the picture. It's not so hard to make a good show - it's almost elementary.",1278892800,16,2870,4.596868884540117
2547175,1,B000EZ7VFI,I wasn't able to watch the disc as it is the worse transfer I have ever seen on a $20.00 DVD. Full of artifacting and block noise. A tenth generation VHS looks better then this awful release. It's to bad as I was really looking forward to seeing these episodes.

2547177,5,B000EZ7VFI,"For many years, fans of Sherlock Holmes have been aware of the BBC series starring the great Peter Cushing as HOlmes.
However, due to the BBC policy of erasing tapes for reuse, episodes of this show have seldom been available for those living in the US--and those that were available (through gray-market sellers) were not very watchable.
Therefore, this collection of episodes, each in nice clear and clean prints, is a joy to receive.  As expected, Cushing makes a very fine HOlmes and Nigel Stock makes an equally fine Watson.
One can only hope that BBC can locate more of these episodes--as well as some of the Douglas Wilmer shows that followed.",1266364800,3,650,4.803571428571429

2547179,5,B000EZ7VFI,"I got this little series with a gift card and was anxious to see it.  It's quite good.  It was made in the sixties (you can tell by the hairstyles) and it was well made in the BBC fashion with exterior shots filmed and the interior ones taped.  The first one is a two parter of ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"".  It is a good adaptation of the novel and worthy to stand up against adaptation of the Holmes' novel.  The only downside to this collection is it's limitation to only five shows.
However, it is worthy of a look see.",1265241600,4,526,4.1683168316831685
2547180,4,B000EZ7VFI,"I have all the Jeremy Brett versions of Sherlock Holmes on DVD but after seeing the 1959 film THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES with Peter Cushing wanted this set to see more of Cushing's portrayal of Holmes.  Most viewers will not be disappointed with the Holmes portrayed by Peter Cushing.  His acting is superb adding a bit of dash and difference to the Holmes stories.

One should take note, however, that THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES of this BBC TV set IS NOT the one of the 1959 movie also starring Christopher Lee.  All features within this 3 disc set are from BBC TV.  While interesting to see they can be a bit ragged in places and some of the sets leave a bit also to be wished for.

Overall if one enjoys Holmes and the Holmes' stories there cannot be any disappointment in these discs.  It's unfortunate that only these handful of stories survive from those years.

Though I yet prefer the Jeremy Brett series as being more professionally done, these discs are good and enjoyable to watch.  Unfair perhaps, but forty-plus years of improvement in film does make a difference.  But Peter Cushing has left us with a capital performance where Sherlock Holmes is concerned, while the role of Dr. Watson is more than ably performed as well.

Cushing plays Holmes as a pretty likeable fellow (although occasionally impatient with those less acute), and Nigel Stock is a serviceable Watson--it's fun to watch him enamored with Mary Morstan in The Sign of Four.  Production values are the usual high quality you expect from the BBC, and the stories are quite true to the books.  I only wish more episodes had survived.",1518220800,,421,4.901408450704225

8115957,3,B000EZ7VFI,"As stated in other reviews, these are the only known surviving copies of the late 1960s BBC Sherlock Holmes series with Peter Cushing as The Great Detective. (Peter Wilmer was the original Holmes in this series; Cushing replaced him in 1968.) Cushing makes for a positively excellent Holmes; indeed, I think his portrayal here is better than his turn as Holmes in the 1959 film version of Hound of the Baskervilles, a tale which is also dramatized here. Nigel Stock is less successful as Dr. Watson; I find him just a tad bit too bluff and stodgy, though his intelligence and pluck is suitably highlighted. Also commendable is the costuming, which is superb.

Unfortunately, the scripts themselves seem rather pale reflections of the original stories, and the direction and editing are such that, as another reviewer remarked, it seems as if one is sitting and watching a rather limp play on stage. These episodes were also done during a period when interior scenes were recorded on videotape while exteriors were shot on film, so that switching between inside and out often creates a sense of discontinuity. All in all, these discs are worth watching in order to savor Cushing's take on Holmes and for some period details. Sadly, though, they lack the energy and elan of the original stories.",1478304000,,1293,4.904109589041096
