LIDDELL VS ORTIZ 2

I still to this day have trouble watching this event, it literally is one of very few events I can't stand to watch. That of course is because Liddell beats Tito in what I think was a complete rip off, I'll get to that a little later though. Minus the main event there were some good fights on this card.

1. CHRISTIAN WELLISCH VS ANTHONY PEROSH-the first round is an excellent showing for Wellisch as he completely dominates Perosh. The fight was almost over in the first. The second round is amazing, Perosh actually turns it around and dominates the second round. Even though Wellisch turns it around for a little bit but I still think Perosh took that round. The third is a little less easy to judge because both of them are tired, but they still step it up. Both just swing to the end and leave us with a great hard fought fight, Wellisch ends up taking the judges decision. 5/5

2. RORY SINGER VS YUSHIN OKAMI-the first round is mainly a feeling out process as neither wants to get to give way to the other. The round ends with enough action to keep it interesting. Most of the second round is just like the first, but once it goes down and Rory makes Okami stand up this round gets great. Rory delivers some great up kicks like I haven't seen in a while. Don't understand why people were booing. The third round is a little more exciting as Okami gets Singer down mounts him and then punches Rory into submission. 4.5/5

3. GABRIEL GONZAGA VS CARMELO MARRERO-Gonzaga completely controls this fight, it doesn't even go past the first round. He finishes the fight with an arm bar, and puts on a BJJ display for every MMA fan out there. This fight was an amazing display of ground work by Gonzaga, beautiful fight. 5/5

4. THIAGO ALVES VS TONY DESOUZA-Alves dominates the first round with devastating punches, the fight is almost stopped near the end of the round. The second ends fairly quickly when Alves lands a nice knee into the face of Tony. The ref stops afterwards after a little ground and pound. 5/5

5. MICHAEL BISPING VS ERIC SHAFER-I have to say that I am not a fan of Bisping, ever since Matt Hamil killed him yet the judges still gave it to Bisping I have really disliked this guy. This fight is real good for the first round that it lasts. Eric completely dominates an obviously less experienced ground game opponent in Bisping. He almost ends this fight plenty of times, but Bisping toughs it out and survives through every thing that is thrown at him. He lands a good kick toward the end and pounds on him till the ref stops it. 4/5

6. ANDREI ARLOVSKI VS MARCIO CRUZ-I remember watching this fight live and laughing at the end while saying ""man that completely messed up"". The fight ends in the first round when Andrei knocks out Cruz in humorous fashion. Now I have to say that then and now I believe Andrei should have been disqualified. What happened was Cruz had a nice leg lock on him and Andrei was about to tap, so instead of tapping out he illegally kicks Cruz in the face because he didn't want to loose on his come back fight. Then the ref tells Cruz to come up then restarts the fight without telling Cruz to go back down so as soon as the ref says go Andrei can now punch him because he is sitting up. He lands a hard punch to Cruz's face and then even after is warned by the ref continues to punch Cruz on the back of the head. And even though he does not stop hitting him on the back of the head the ref awards the fight to a cheating Arlovski. I am going to give it this score based solely on Cruz's preformance. 4/5

7. CHRIS LEBEN VS JASON MACDONALD-a great first round that sees both fighters giving it their all, Chris with strikes and Jason with take down attempts. It was a fairly even first round for the two, with a slight edge going towards Leben. The second round was a lot more exciting with an early knock down by Leben but as soon as Macdonald gets him down he chokes Leben out. 5/5

8. FORREST GRIFFIN VS KEITH JARDINE-what a fight this was here, I knew Jardine would win this but not as early as he did. It looked as if Forrest was going to take the round even though it was some what even. But towards the end of the round Jardine just unloads on Forrest and gets the TKO victory in what some considered an upset. I don't know why, I was rooting for him the whole time. What upsets me about this fight is that the UFC did it again to us and took out the post fight interviews in the octagon. This is where Forrest gave the greatest post fight interview of all time, it was extremely funny. Also the emotional Forrest Griffin let his guard down a little a cried after his loss. Some make fun of him for that but I think it is that emotion that took him to defeat Rampage for the title. 5/5

9. LIGHT HEAVYWIEGHT CHAMPIONSHIP-CHUCK LEDDELL VS TITO ORTIZ-you will never understand how excited I was for this rematch between these two. I was so ready for Tito to take back the title and avenge the previous loss to Liddell [who just lost tonight by knock out to Rashad Evans]. Ever since I noticed that Liddell likes to cheat to win fights like eye poking and grabbing onto the cage when someone is going to slam him [ask Randy Couture about all that]. The first round is amazing, and I mean that for both fighters. Tito really impressed me with his head movement and defense, and when he was knocked down cleanly by Liddell he showed how much heart he has and stayed alive. Chuck to his credit acknowledged that at the end of the round, and Chuck did a great job in round one. Round two was another great back and forth battle that saw Tito even things up and take the round after a great take down, some kicks and punches that connected on Chuck. But once again to chucks credit he came just as hard and once again acknowledged Tito for the round. The third round is where things get tricky in my mind and is where I think Tito was cheated. The round up until the end was another great back and forth battle between the two and if it would have went the distance I would say Chuck was in the lead as far as points. When Tito rocked Chuck he started coming forward and Chuck connected on him, when Tito goes down and misses the take down he covers up and is intelligently defending himself. As Randy and Joe point out Tito is doing a good job of covering up and not getting hit in the head, Chuck is punching Tito's arms. Now go back and watch this and you will notice that Tito starts to get up and roll out right before the ref jumps in. now as much as I don't like Liddell the ref was completely to blame on this one. Both men came to fight and neither were breaking any rules, if the ref would not have jumped in who knows what would have happened. Look at how happy Danna White is that Tito lost this fight, then goes and congratulates Tito. It was cool to see Rampage in the audience.

There is a nice behind the scenes featurette.",1220745600,,6915,4.270992366412214
8181570,4,B000NVIGMK,"The Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz fight from UFC 47 was one of the biggest, most anticipated hyped bout in UFC history. And now the rematch is here.

Christian Wellisch vs. Anthony Perosh
The first round was pretty good. It starts out with some good strikes and leg shots. Perosh would then try to take down Wellisch for a while. Wellisch got in some good combination strikes and soon knocking Perosh down towards the end of the round. Round 2 starts off very exciting with Perosh seeming like he was playing possum and then getting the advantage with some early combinations and soon taking Wellisch down with a few slams. You even hear some BOO chants towards Perosh. Pretty much slow 3rd round but pretty good fight. 4/5

Rory Singer vs. Yushin Okami
This first round was pretty much a filling out one process for the two. They're was only a few punches and kicks here and there, nothing special. You even get some boos at the end of the round. Okami gets the takedown early in the 2nd round and pretty much taking control. Okami does take a hard kick in the face. Okami gets control in the 3rd round as well and soon takes it to Singer in this round. Not a whole lot of excitement. 2/5

Gabriel Gonzaga vs. Carmelo Marrero
Gonzaga soons gets the take down and applies the sleeper on Marrero and soon applies the arm bar to make Marrero tap. 3/5

Tony Desouza vs. Thiago Alves
Desouza takes a hard right punch by Alves which laid him down and gave the control to Alves. The closing minute was very exciting with McCarthey almost stopping the fight. The 2nd round seems like Alves was just toying with Desouza and throwing him around. Desouze took a hard knee which knocked him out. 3.5/5

Michael Bisping vs. Eric Schafer
Pretty exciting and non-stop first round. Schafer trys to get on the back off Bisping but then Bisping just slammed Schafer on his head. Nice back and forth contest with Bisping taking it to Schafer towards the end of the round. 4/5

Andrei Arlovski vs. Marcio Cruz
First round really consists of Cruz trying to take control of Arlovski's left leg. They soon get leg locked and then Arlovski just strike Cruz with a hard right fist to the face and then just whells on the back of his head. 3/5

Jason Macdonald vs. Chris Leben
Very early takedown in the first seconds of the fight. It then turns into a grappling contest with both men just holding onto each other. Leben got in some good knee shots. The second round was a back and forth fight with Macdonald & Leben getting some good takedowns. Nice chokeout to end the fight. 3.5/5

Main Events
Forrest Griffin vs. Keith Jardin
The first round was pretty much a slugfest. Strong combinations and kicks from both men with a strong combination of lefts and rights by Jardin taking Griffin down to finish him off. 3.5/5

Light Heavyweight Championship
Tito Ortiz vs. Chuck Liddell
Defiantely one of the most hyped rematches of all time, Ortiz/Liddell 2. Tito came out swinging here in the first round while Liddell pretty much standing his ground. Liddell finishes strong by taking down Tito and making him bleed with hard combination strikes. The second round was really with both men standing their ground and getting in some hard shots. Tito would eventually get a takedown for a little bit. The third round had more shots and both men feeling like they can take each other out and one man did just that. Great fight. Fight of the night for me. 5/5

If you wanna see some good MMA style fighting and a good hyped main event, then I recommend on getting ufc 66.",1219190400,3,3536,4.54559748427673
8181571,5,B000NVIGMK,"This was a solid UFC card all the way around. The fighters were well-matched against each other, with some surprising results. Griffin vs. Jardine was an explosive, albeit relatively short fight; and Leben vs. MacDonald showed how persistance and tenacity pay off.

I admit that I was just as interested in seeing the UFC debut of England's Michael Bisping (following his winning The Ultimate Fighter 3) as I was in watching Liddell and Ortiz come to blows again. Suffice it to say, neither fight disappoints. With the exception of Arlovski and Cruz, there wasn't a fight on this card that I was disappointed in. Highly recommended!",1187913600,,632,4.962264150943396
8181572,5,B000NVIGMK,"Nice fight card. UFC 66 put the exclamation point on 2006. 9 skilled bouts, including some top fighters. With that said I gave UFC 66 a 5 star rating because of some surprises, and the headliner was worth the price of the DVD itself. A classic championship bout that brought out the best in both Chuck & Tito. I highly recommend UFC 66 to any MMA fans.",1186012800,,352,4.268656716417911
