6050658,5,B00G3BRC24,"I've been waiting for this ""final"" season (as far as I'm concerned).  ""Alice"" was an awesome ensemble show while Polly Holliday was a member.  The problem is, Linda Lavin certainly wasn't why people watched the show.  Polly Holliday is for whom ""Alice"" will be remembered, and this season is her last.  Diane Ladd is an extraordinary actress (no argument there), and even though she was the original ""Flo"" in ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,"" once Polly Holliday embodied the character, she was irreplaceable.

Others will certainly disagree, but for me (and many, many others), ""Alice"" started and ended with Flo, no matter how many seasons the show ran.  It was her chemistry with the cast that made it work for the majority.  I'm finished purchasing ""Alice"" now, and won't be getting any further releases.  Again, no disrespect to Diane Ladd or Celia Weston, but Polly, you were the best!",1383177600,8,892,4.939597315436242
6050659,5,B00G3BRC24,"The fourth season of ""ALICE"" found the gang at Mel's Diner enjoying their highest ratings ever as the show finished #4 among all programs on the air during the 1979-80 TV Season. This was also a year of big changes as the show loses it's most popular character when Polly Holliday's Flo exits for her own short-lived spinoff series. ""Flo's Farewell"" is a bittersweet episode that gives the sassy redhead a fitting sendoff and contains a touching scene that Holliday and Tayback play perfectly. With Flo gone, ""ALICE"" loses it's best character, but good writing and strong performances keep the show going strong for the next couple of seasons at least.

In what was likely seen by producers as a clever casting move, they brought in the original Flo from the 1974 film ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"" when Diane Ladd arrives as new character Belle Dupree, an ex-waitress of Mel's who returns from Mississippi with aspirations of becoming a famous country songwriter. Ladd appears in the season's final six episodes and some things about her character work and others don't. When Flo left, she took her famous catchphrase with her (""Kiss My Grits!"") and the writers try something for Belle, but instead of a simple three word phrase, they saddle her with the clunky ""My little voice calls me Isabelle"" which is thankfully dropped quickly after a few unsuccessful attempts to turn it into a running gag.

Despite the cast change, ""ALICE"" still delivers some great episodes this season. ""Vera the Vamp"" is one of the season's best and made a strong showing when WB polled fans back in 2006 for their picks to be included on the Fan Favorites disc. Also of note is the season-opener with guest star Telly Savalas containing a terrific scene in which Lavin serenades him on bended-knee imploring him to return to the diner to dissuade Vera from quitting. Mel's famous chili steals the show in THREE separate episodes this season. First, Mel fires Flo when he believes she gave his recipe to his biggest competitor. Later, Mel's invited to prepare his chili on Dinah Shore's TV show and finally tries to get Art Carney to endorse it as Chili con Carney. ""Good Buddy Flo"" features a hilarious and elaborate sight-gag as a jealous Flo crashes her two-timing trucker boyfriend's rig through the wall of Mel's diner.

Even if you aren't a fan of the Belle character, this one is a must-have being Flo's last hurrah on the series. Now that the character has exited ""ALICE"", hopefully her spinoff will be released by Warner Archive shortly since the episodes have already been available as digital download on Amazon for several years now.",1382659200,11,2629,4.850779510022272
6050660,5,B00G3BRC24,Now I can have all my FLO episodes. I love the truck episode and FLO drives into the dinner. Great episodes when Mel puts in a time clock and the girls go on strike. Carrie this season (Mel's mom) takes over in the dinner when Mel's back goes out. Watch Flo take over and make the biscuts. I also love seeing Art Carney and Dinah Shore in thise season. A must buy to complete the FLO years....,1382659200,10,393,4.116883116883117

Her replacement Belle (played by Dianne Lad) is good, but definitely NOT the Flo we all know and love.  Belle appears for several of the last episodes of the season.  Special guest stars this season include Telly Savalis, Dina Shore and Martha Raye. Still another great season of Alice that will have you definitely ROFL :-)",1415577600,5,446,4.620253164556962

6050741,5,B00G3BRC24,"Even without Flo, the show was good. I love Linda Lavin, Beth Howland, Vic Tayback, Philip McKeon, Polly Holiday, but Diane Ladd and Celia Weston were also fun to watch. This show was such a treat. The various guest stars and recurring characters mad this classic...well a classic. Please keep the rest of the seasons coming!!!",1393286400,7,327,4.857142857142857

6050745,5,B00G3BRC24,This sitcom is so much fun to watch. One of the classics from the 1970's that has timeless episodes. The cast plays off of each other so well. One of my very favorite shows from childhood that I still enjoy today. This is a must own series for people that enjoy comedy that is geared for the whole family to see.,1387670400,,312,4.131147540983607
6050746,4,B00G3BRC24,loved this show beautiful transfer but like the other dvds there is no closed captioning so for those of us with hearing problems it will be less enjoyable,1387584000,2,155,4.571428571428571
6050747,5,B00G3BRC24,THIS COMMEDY SHOW IS REALLY GREAT.!!I I USE TO WATCH THIS SHOW DAILY BACK IN THE 1980'S. COMEDY SHOW WERE REALLY GREAT. THIS SHOW ALICE WILL KEEP YOU LAUGHING. THE PERSON THAT PLAY ALICE (LINDA LAVIN ) IS AN GREAT ACTOR. THE WHOLE INTIRE CAST IS REALLY GREAT. I SUGEST THAT YOU GET THIS SET OF COMEDY SHOW AND YOU WILL REALLY ENJOY IT.,1384128000,,335,4.25
6050748,5,B00G3BRC24,"The departure of Polly Holliday was devastating to this show. Her replacement Diane Ladd simply did not blend well with the other characters - maybe that's why she ended up leaving too. It's remarkable to me that the show continued to enjoy high ratings even without Polly Holliday. The producers should have never let her go - they should have kissed her grits to keep her around. Oh well, it's all history now.

Anyway, great DVD's! Thank you Warner Bros. for remembering us old folks who love these older TV shows like ALICE.",1383696000,4,528,4.67741935483871
6050749,5,B00G3BRC24,"Although the cover photo features Belle (the great Diane Ladd, who I love), Flo still stars in the majority of the the episodes this season. Out of Flo's 18 episodes, some of them are a few of the best episodes of the entire series- including the episode where Flo drives a truck through the diner, the one where Mel and the girls are guests on the Dinah Shore talk show, the one where Tommy and Alice sing outside a shopping center, and the one where the gang is stuck in the diner on Christmas during a power failure.

In the 18th episode, Flo quits her job and moves away. In the 19th episode, Belle is hired as Flo's replacement.

The picture quality is excellent (as always) and all of the episodes are the uncut, 25 minute versions. This was the highest rated season of the entire series, and it's easy to see why.",1383609600,20,820,4.352941176470588
6050750,5,B00G3BRC24,"As you can tell by the DVD label, Polly Holliday as Flo leaves the series for her own sitcom after 18 episodes during the fourth season.  I was a huge ALICE fan during its entire run, and was sad to see Flo depart, but equally excited and curious about the series' future without Flo.  Fortunately, ALICE continued to do well attracted amazing guest starts and had fun character development during the fourth season and for the rest of it's nine year run.  Diane Ladd's ""Belle"" stepped in as the new waitress and the antics and fun never quit.  Sadly, Polly Holliday's sitcom FLO didn't ever achieve the goals it had hoped for and was cancelled after less than 30 episodes.

ALICE is an excellent series and all nine seasons of ALICE are wonderful and highly recommended.  Great comedy, super guest stars, and excellent writing made ALICE one of the most memorable of all sitcoms.  Thanks, Warner Archives, for the fourth season release, which included guest stars Telly Savalas, Art Carney and Eve Aden as guests, along with Martha Rae returning as Mel's controlling mother.  So many of us are excited to get the entire series, and Season Four is another step along the way!",1383436800,11,1175,4.7254901960784315
8620342,3,B00G3BRC24,This season was ok.  But Belle is no Flo.  I got sick of hearing about her inner voice.  But she tried.  Alice doesn't really do much on the show.  Except roll her eyes.  And when she sings those gawd awful tunes I have to turn down the sound or ff through them.  OK that said.  It's still better than just about everything on tv today.  So don't panic or anything.,1512604800,,365,4.1

8620344,4,B00G3BRC24,"While the show remained firmly ensconced at the top of the rating charts, Alice's 1979-80 Season saw some big changes coming to the staff of Mel's. Polly Holiday's Flo proved an irresistible spin-off lure, and she departed for Flo's Yellow Rose partway through the season.

Filling in for Flo for the remainder of the season was no less a talent than original Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore film Flo, Diane Ladd, playing ""Belle,"" former Mel employee and former flame. And Alice continued its grand dining tradition of putting celebs on the menu  found playing themselves this season are both Telly AND George Savalas, Art Carney (Vera's cousin!), and Dinah Shore (hosting Mel  and his chili!  on her talk show!).

Memorable guests NOT playing themselves include the great Eve Arden as a local talk host and Martha Raye as Mel's overbearing mother, Carrie Sharples. This 3-Disc, 26 Episode Collection contains the entire 4th Season.",1502496000,,932,5.065359477124183
