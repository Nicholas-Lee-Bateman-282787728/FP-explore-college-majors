8395040,5,B003DXG6U4,"If you remember Carman growing up, this is a recent, PATROTRIC, cutting edge program he did live on TBN.  Though the songs were written in the 80's ARE THEY EVER CURRENT for our culture and lives today.  I love it and being on DVD is great.  He still has many of his things on VHS but they are being put on DVD though slowly.  His music is most on CD's and on Amazon or on his web site carmantv so BE SURE TO GET THIS.",1359763200,,418,3.8823529411764706
