8338170,1,B001RJWRQ8,"This 50-minute program only shows kids training at the acrobatic school.  There are hardly any shots of an actual performance, so you never get to see the results of all their hard work.  Also, the Product Description is wrong.  The disc is not about the Heilongjiang Acrobatic Troupe. It's about the Wuqiao School of Acrobatic Arts.  And there is noting at all about ice skating.  Most of the footage is about trying to form human pyramids.  A huge disappointment.",1247961600,15,465,4.822784810126582
