4007170,1,B002WN8IPW,"POST GRAD

STARRING: Alexis Bledel, Michael Keaton, Jane Lynch, Zach Gilford, Rodrigo Santoro, J. K. Simmons, Bobby Coleman and Carol Burnett

WRITTEN BY: Kelly Fremon

DIRECTED BY: Vicky Jenson

Rated: PG-13
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 21 August 2009

Instead of Post Grad, they should have titled this movie `Random Events Filmed in Un-sequential Order.' It would have been a lot more fitting. It's absolutely one of the worst movies of 2009.

The first two or three minutes were great. The filmmakers used a cool technique showing our lead character Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) talking to us through her web-cam. She fills us in on all of her plans for the future, now that she is a college graduate. You instantly like Alexis Bledel for Ryden, and I was very excited to see what was going to happen next.

What happened was the film became an absolute nightmare! I felt like I was watching Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen again. Nothing made sense and characters were introduced that had no business being in the story to begin with and there was no plot! It played out like the film itself was confused about what kind of a movie it was supposed to be.

Rather than securing a job, the first thing Ryden does after graduating is find the perfect apartment. When she lies about having an employer on the application for her lease and her best friend Adam (Zach Gilford) reminds her of this, she explains that she will have one in a few short hours. On her way to the job interview however, her car is destroyed in a hit and run. Things don't work out so well and she doesn't get the position; so she loses out on her apartment and heads back home to live with her folks.

Her family is perhaps the only positive element the film has to offer. They are a lot of fun. Michael Keaton plays her dad and Jane Lynch is her mom; needless to say, we get several laughs from both of these brilliant actors. Grandma was hilariously played by Carol Burnett and the film could have used more of her. As great as they were, I have no idea what bearing her little brother's character Hunter (Bobby Coleman) had on the story. Bobby Coleman is a very talented young man, but Hunter seemed to just be there for the sake of being there.

Ryden's best friend Adam was a strong asset to this disappointing movie as well. Zach Gilford played him as best he could with what he had to work with, which I'm sure wasn't much. He's the typical nice guy, in love with his best friend who has no idea of this. I'm actually not sure if we like the character or if we just like Zach Gilford.

Ryden explains early on to Adam and us, that she has a love for books. These are her passion in life and nearly all that she knows about the world, she has learned from them. The career she wasn't able to land, was also in this field. She must have forgotten all about her love for them after the first few minutes of the movie, because it's never mentioned again.

From there the movie zigzags all over the place. I can't make heads or tails out of where they were trying to go with it. At one point she starts working for her dad in his luggage store, and then she is considering helping him sell belt buckles until it turns out that the buckles were stolen and he unknowingly bought them illegally and lands himself in jail.

Then we see that Adam and his father (J.K. Simmons) clearly have some issues. One involves a woman his father is seeing at the supermarket he runs; but there is no resolution. Why do we need to know what's going on with Adam and his father to begin with, when Adam is a side character and the story is about Ryden? It would make more sense to me if this was a romantic comedy and he had a bigger part in the plot, but he doesn't. And how did they get J.K. Simmons on board for this obscure and pointless role?

Then Ryden shows an interest in the next-door neighbor who is 12 years older than her and after their date that seems to have gone pretty well - we don't see or hear from him for the longest time. She doesn't seem to notice this either and it's not like she's upset he hasn't called or anything; like in most movies. She simply does not notice.

She instead, deals with some other issues. Like finally coming to the realization that Adam is in love with her, only now it is too late because she blew him off and he will be moving away. Then the creepy older next-door neighbor comes back into the picture and tells her he is moving back to Brazil, where his family is.

Then we go way off-track form anything even involving Ryden, when her brother Hunter has a box-car race. What was the point of the box-car scene? He shows up for the race, wins, then the brakes go out and he flies into a lake. His entire family is right there standing on the shore, waiting to see if he's okay but not one of them jumps in to save him. I get that the water wasn't that deep, but they didn't know that until he stands up, after being completely submerged under the water. Maybe they just didn't want to get wet?

Then Ryden randomly lands the job after all. Apparently things didn't work out so well with the evil girl they hired instead of her, so they give her a call and tell her she is hired. But she went through no obstacles involving seeking this position, whatsoever. She moved on and accepted it, so we aren't even excited for her because it's so ridiculous.

I know I keep using the word 'then' by the way, but there is a reason for it; each random transition we make from one horrible scene to the next, is as unoriginal and dry as the word 'then'. If this bugs you, THEN the movie will agitate you!

There are several more moments in the film that were completely misplaced and poorly done, but I have spent more than enough time on this review as it is. If you still want to watch the film after having read this, then I haven't saved you your 90 minutes anyway, so who cares?

I will say that I was shocked to discover that Vicky Jenson had directed both of the amazing films Shark Tale and Shrek, prior to directing this. Not to mention that, huge director and producer Ivan Reitman, who brought us such classics as Twins, Ghostbusters and Stripes, produced this hunk of nothing as well. Who knows what happened here? All I know is that I was in exactly one frame of mind when Post Grad, was post: GLAD.",1263168000,3,6315,4.3310753598645215

4007214,1,B002WN8IPW,"We just kept looking at each other and saying, ""Why?"" Which isn't that bad- movies can be weird. But they were trying to be so funny throughout the whole movie- everything was just all over the place.
Alexis was adorable- the acting wasn't really that bad- it was just too much forced humor. You kind of have to force humor when you throw in running over cats, belt-buckle fraud, grandmas testing out coffins, homemade go-cart racing, guacamole infomercials, stealing ice-cream trucks...see what I mean? And we're suppose to care about a love story amidst all of this? It was just distracting.
Alexis finally lands her dream job (that we don't really get a sense that she doesn't enjoy in the slightest), and her Dad tells her he's proud that she's throwing it all away and moving without warning to a guy who blew her off.
You can't really sympathize with her love interest because the first time he lets her know he loves her (finally- after all these years of pining for her), he's mad and then stalks off. When she finally has this puzzle piece that he loves her and she realizes she loves him too- she goes after him in a totally vulnerable way and he blows her off? So she has to go after him again? Really? More like he's a loser who should have told you he loved you sooner or started jumping for joy when you told him you felt the same way.

4007243,4,B002WN8IPW,"Post Grad stars Gilmore Girl's Alexis Bledel as Ryden, a girl who did all the right things in high school and university and expects to land a job with her dream employer doing what she's always wanted to do, as that's what teachers, parents and everyone else has told her will happen if she put in the hard work during her young life. Something I and lots of other people can no doubt relate to. However at the interview (by sheer coincidence her dream job just happens to have a vacancy at the time she graduates) the interviewer pretty much says next after she gives a well rehearsed trained for positive answer to the first question.  Reality hits, her dream employer simply isn't interested, neither are lesser in her mind publication houses.  Her dad (Michael Keaton) wants to start a belt buckle from home retail venture, she can't think of anything that screams life failure more so than joining him with that.  Depressed and mentally lost she doesn't know what to do.  To make matters worse her best friend just isn't taking the hint that they are only ever going to be friends and his father wants him to move to New York to become a lawyer.  Life hasn't turned out the way she thought it would.

Post Grad is certainly above the standard of a simply watchable film.  It's nice to see Jane Lynch not just playing another version of Sue Sylvester (Glee would air the same year this movie hit cinemas), she doesn't have memorable lines in this, which fits the movie since the movie isn't about her character (she's Ryden's mother).  Keaton is somewhat underutilised but you've got to remember in 2009 it had been a few decades since he had been in anything that had much success box office wise when he was a household name in the 80's and early 90's, he was probably in this as a recognisable face to make the parents think about buying or renting this to watch with their graduating age kids.  No doubt this may have spent a week or two in cinemas but it was pretty much a straight to DVD type movie.  It's probably Lynch and Keaton that will carry the marketability of this DVD into the future as Bledel's post Gilmore career unfortunately seems to have died with this movie.  A shame as she plays a very likeable character on the screen.  Perhaps she's became a bit typecast as a teen/early twenties daughter and you can only plausibly pull that off for so long when you get older in real life.  If we're being honest Ryden is pretty similar to the character Rory on Gilmore Girls so that probably didn't help her career either.

But I enjoyed this movie, as a university graduate myself I can relate to the how hard it is to find employment in the field you studied and the ridiculous way from high school days to selecting your university to even when your doing the degree you are told you will.  Most people I still know from university don't work in the industry they studied, I certainly don't so I found it refreshing that this movie highlighted reality.  You could even throw in the reality from the best friend who wants to be more than friends point of view, seeing the girl you'd do anything for pick a shallow older guy who you know is just going to use and then give the flick to.  This is also a fairly common reality check for a lot of guys, again I've been there.  Spoilers follow - although the first part of the film tells the story like happens in the real world, I was disappointed that they decided to make this a happy ending ""chick flick' style realise the guy you should be with is the best friend type movie.  Why couldn't he have noticed someone else and she meet someone else rather than just deciding to throw away her non relationship dreams, move to New York and I guess become a stay at home housewife down the track.  Doesn't really seem plausible to me, plus how long would they last when reality hits home that he's still the same guy she only wanted to be friends with in the first place and she's bored just being a girlfriend doing whatever job she can find in New York to pay the bills before he knocks her up.

With a better ending this would have been a great film but it's still a fairly decent viewing experience.  Especially if you've undergone tertiary education yourself and found the real world a lot harder to achieve your dreams than was portrayed by others throughout your childhood.",1422057600,,4344,4.472151898734177

In the end, she learns that having the dream job isn't everything she thought it would be and that her relationships with people are more important.

Please don't assume that your affinity for Biedel in Gilmore Girls or her other works (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, et al), will translate to this vastly different work.

Biedel made this film at the height of her popularity; it was exceptionally unprofitable and negatively recieved, and her lack of starring roles since then is primarily due to this. I write very few reviews; but Amazon attempting to present this as a popular or well-recieved work, or even all that recent (it was made, widely ridiculed and horribly bombed four years ago) is tantamount to fraud.",1378080000,2,792,4.739130434782608

As a recent college grad myself, I can say it mostly-successfully embodies the process many of us go through: the rush of graduation, with the attention and feeling of achievement, to the ""now what?"" feeling we get when our lifestyle of 16 years comes to a grinding halt. The end of the movie is what put the nail in it's coffin of average, when the plot had to choose between representing what's accurate and what we want from a romance flick. Being that the accurate representation of the experience of a post-grad is the only thing going for this movie (in addition to the okay cast) the ending should have been different.",1377388800,3,736,4.625954198473282

4007307,2,B002WN8IPW,"****** WARNING: This Review Contains SPOILERS ******

I had high hopes for this movie because I love Alexis Bledel. I agree with many of the other reviewers that said this movie was all over the place. It just seemed underdeveloped. The actors aren't the problem, the script/story is. Because of that, it's near impossible to grow to love any of the characters, which is unfortunate.

The story is a typical, recycled high school/young adult type: the girl is incredibly ambitious, beautiful, sweet, and perfect yet still quirky enough for the audience to relate to. She has a best friend, a guy, who is incredibly handsome, kind, sensitive, and talented--not to mention he is CRAZY about her, but of course she doesn't realize it. She is also highly competitive with another girl who has been her enemy ""since the third grade"" who subsequently beats her out of everything (valedictorian, dream job, etc) even though she is a jerk.

She loses big on the job of her dreams (to her nemesis, naturally) and has to move back home with her parents. Her family is the typical ""crazy but lovable"" family. Many stories involving her family are half-developed and seem displaced; her much younger brother begging for her dad's attention, her ""dying"" grandmother (what happened to her oxygen tank after the graduation? And what exactly is she ""dying"" from?), her dad's crazy get-money schemes, to name a few. These side stories sound like they should be from a completely different movie, as they hardly involved the main character (if at all). This is also true for the ""hot best friend"" side story with his father; they clearly have some big problems, which are made incredibly apparent in just the very first scene of the movie, but they are never expanded on OR solved. Why hire an actor (and a good one at that) to play his father if his character is just going to be a prop in 2 short scenes? The only problem that we know (somewhat) about is that his dad wants him to go to law school, where he had been accepted, but he doesn't; he wants to be a musician.

Then she meets her older, foreign, successful, sexy yet quirky neighbor. After her dad runs over her cat, he invites her to stay for a meal after they hold an impromptu funeral for the cat. They eat, and then talk a bit, then start making out. Then he offers her a good job, then makes her quit (with him) her first day, and they spend a romantic day at the beach but upon returning home she seems to randomly no longer be attracted to or interested in him. (And then he moves back to Brazil.) Because she spent the day with him, she forgets and misses her hot best friend's first music gig, where he was supposed to take her for a fancy dinner afterwards and presumably express his love for her. Because she didn't come, he tells her she will no longer be a part of his life. (That seems a bit harsh...)

After this, the executive of the company at which she originally applied offers her the dream job because they fired her nemesis. She takes it, and is really good at it, and well-liked in the company. However, she learns her hot BFF is moving away for law school--they make up, and she realizes she loves him after he leaves. So, of course, she quits her dream job and travels out to NY (from CA) on a whim to surprise him, confess her love, and move to be with him, all with her father's blessing. They meet, kiss, and live happily ever after.

I get that this is supposed to express that you should ""follow your heart"" and that life shouldn't follow a checklist, but it was incredibly cheesy and unrealistic and, well, just dumb. As a young professional, it would look incredibly bad on your resume that your FIRST job after college was a great, coveted job but you quit without notice after just a couple weeks. Furthermore, she WANTED THAT JOB. It's not like she was forced into a profession she wasn't passionate about, the company was bad, or that she hated it. Just the opposite: it was what she longed for, what she worked really hard for, and she gave it up for a guy who she wasn't even dating and had never dated, but was HOPING that they MIGHT be able to make it work. She literally just moved out to New York with a snap of her fingers, no house, no job, no nothing.

It was dumb, because the story was supposed to be about her life after college and the trials and tribulations and stress and strength and growth that come along with that, which just never happened. The story was supposed to be about following your dreams, but she leaves her dreams to chase a guy across the country. The guy, also, doesn't follow his dreams but just goes to law school which he doesn't even want to do. Basically, the message is: if you work hard your entire life for your dreams, leave them once you get them if you have a crush on somebody, and if you have a dream after college, don't pursue it--just go to law school and be miserable instead.

This review might sound like I'm leaving key details out; I'm not. This is literally the movie. The transitions take place immediately, in a hurried and confusing way. The character development is seriously lacking, the storyline has ADHD, and the ending is awful. And it had so much potential :-(",1365465600,5,5206,4.495771670190275

Ryden (Alexis Bledel aka Zooey Deschanel light) and her friend Adam (Zach Gilford) have just graduated college. Ryden has planned her life, except she didn't get the job she wanted. That job was taken by her arch rival Jessica Bard (Catherine Reitman) her ""Darth Vader"" since the third grade. Adam is love with Ryden who takes him for granted. He has a chance to travel 3,000 miles east to go to Columbia Law School, but hasn't had up his mind what he wants to do in life.

As Ryden hunts for a job, she is supported by her quirky family which I thought could have been better developed. The overly optimistic Ryden quickly becomes a realist as her job search wanes.

The movie is humorous and doesn't get dragged down with dramatic scenes for more than a few minutes. Good flow. Carol Burnett provided me with a few LOL moments. I will say from my experience with cats, they have never done their business in the driveway, they like somewhere they can bury it. It is a romantic comedy, with light emphasis on the romance.

First problem: Alexis had more chemistry with ALL of her male Gilmore Girls costars than this person. (Yes, even with Naked Guy.) Their banter is contrived and not very funny. I know she can be funnier because I've seen it when she was just a teenager. The script is just bad.

Second problem: It can't really decide what it's trying to say. Sometimes that's okay, since it can evoke thought, but this movie didn't make me feel very pensive. In the end, the wishy-washy message is that it's okay to relax and figure yourself out, and the people -- and men -- you love are more important than your career. (Which is the opposite message that the feminists wanted to hear, so I think that was a problem for others as well.) I don't necessarily disagree with the message, myself. It's just not very inspiring.

One critic said it best when he said that this romantic comedy was light on romance and light on comedy.

4007380,1,B002WN8IPW,"""Post Grad"" is a corny, rambling satire on today's job market, but hardly holds your attention, and if it is a comedy, I forgot to smile.  The film frames a job hunt by a young college graduate Ryden Malby (Alexis Bledel) who is perky and optimistic.  She always assumed she could find a job with a college diploma.  She has a book publishing company as the first and only place to apply.  She is among many applicants and  the hard cruel world intervenes.  The valedictorian of her class lands the job and Ryden's car is involved in an accident.  She is forced to move back in with her dysfunctional family and look for anything to keep her afloat.  In the meantime her steady comforting relationship with her best friend, Adam (Zach Gilford) comes apart.  Ryden has to decide what is important to her: career or the man she loves.

Overall, it is a pain to watch, the script screams for help, the talented cast cannot save it, and it drags through totally  uninspired direction.",1284768000,,980,4.574712643678161
4007381,1,B002WN8IPW,"Alexis Bledel is Ryden Malby, a post grad student hoping to get a job at a major publishing company. She is willing and ready to work, but unfortunately things didn't turn out as she planned, and Ryden is forced to go home and live with her eccentric family members. Certainly the premise of ""Post Grad"" sounds great on paper (with the recent financial crisis in mind); however, ""Post Grad"" is only remarkable for its ineptitude for comedy or whatever else it wants to be.

In short, the drama is bland. The characters are given no motivation. We don't know who this heroine Ryden Malby is. We don't know why she is so interested in working at a publishing company, so why should we be interested in her ""hardships,"" which as it turns out, not really hardships, but just an ordinary plot device? Heroines like Elle (""Legally Blonde"") and Andy (""The Devil Wears Prada"") knew what they were doing. Ryden just doesn't. Alexis Bledel looks sweet, it is certain, but her character remains one-dimensional throughout.

We are told that her family members are ""weird."" Unlike the family of ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" their weirdness is not very charming. The idea of ""dysfunctional family,"" so overused recently, looks like an excuse for the filmmakers to cover up the lack of ideas or imagination. So many sketchy episodes are strung together including Ryden's friend Adam (Zach Gilford) and his tired father (J. K. Simmons), Ryden's handsome next-door neighbor David (Rodrigo Santoro), her wacky father Walter (Michael Keaton) and wackier grandmother (Carol Burnett), plus box car racing and a dead cat. Not much is funny despite the efforts from the decent cast.

Poorly-written and directed ""Post Grad"" is just another Hollywood-made romantic comedy we don't need, unless you are an avid fan of Alexis Bledel.",1284249600,,1803,5.003333333333333
4007382,2,B002WN8IPW,"Post Grad completely fails.

You know what the biggest problem with it is?  The fact that the script itself is just terrible.  The film never really had a chance to get off the ground because the storyline is just so bland and predictable, however that in itself wouldn't have been a *really* big problem if it wasn't for the fact Post Grad is completely humorless.

Not a single joke that even remotely made me laugh the entire time.  I think I was supposed to laugh during a scene where Alexis Bledal's father steps in cat poo, and a scene later where he runs over the same cat while driving in reverse in his driveway and having to explain the accident to his neighbor, but something about the entire scene really bothers me.

In fact, the entire film bothers me.  There's something not quite right with the execution of the jokes.  Instead of feeling a positive atmosphere whenever a jokes comes in, instead everything gets unusually quiet.  There's something about the atmosphere that brings out the worst in the jokes.  I can't explain exactly what's causing it.

Even the scene where Alexis Bledal's brother pops out of a casket wasn't funny.  It was calmly strange.

I might have an explanation for this unusual atmosphere.  Perhaps the writers were trying to copy the atmosphere from Gilmour Girls and use it for Post Grad?  I assume that's the case.

Besides that, another obvious problem is that the film is loaded with talented actors and actresses that HAVE made me laugh quite hard in the past, but their performance here leaves me completely speechless (and I don't mean that as a compliment either- speechless because I don't understand their style of humor used for this film).

Post Grad is incredibly *bland* from beginning to end.  It's not funny, it's predictably written, and it completely misses the mark by not including any actual laughs.",1282953600,,1863,4.786833855799373

I felt that the relationship between the main character Ryden and her platonic best friend Adam (I think it was) was not seriously developed. The family was just weird which didn't seem to make any sense with the thesis of the movie. In fact during the ""featurette"" the screenwriter had no prior experience of writing scripts and even admitted to not know a thesis until later in the process.

Instead of trying to tell several different stories and relationships they should've just kept it simple to the point and to a central theme about life after graduating.

Dealing with what happens after you graduate from college and before your adult life begins is a tricky time period.  This movie half heartedly addressed this along with other issues, the other half went for cute romance.  The end result?  It was too all over the place and ended up a slightly less then average movie.

I liked all of the characters except for the cheesy south american soccer player across the street but hey, his type exists.  The female lead (Ryden) is part of a  goofy but lovable family of self titled losers: Michale Keaton was the father full of losing money propositions, the mother was low key and the younger oddball brother was cute but the family star was Carol Burnett as the wacky grandmother.  Enter the love interest who has been Ryden's best buddy all through college but would like to be more.  I'll sum up the movie for you:  guy follows girl around like a puppy even after he is kicked a few times, gets mad and goes away, girl realizes what she had and runs after him - the end.

Given all the talent you would think that the movie would work but it falls apart despite some good scenes (anything with Carol Burnett or the derby race).

4007410,1,B002WN8IPW,"This is a terrible movie that they had to stretch to make it to that 88 minute mark. ""Post Grad"" was directed by Vicky Jenson and written by Kelly Fremon. It stars Alexis Bledel as Ryden Malby, a college graduate who had her whole life planned out until the job of her dreams gets taken by her valedictorian rival. She is oblivious to the advances of her guitar-toting, eskimo-pie-offering best friend, her family is nuts, and even the hot guy across the street who was Laura Linney's interest in Love Actually can't make it any better.

All Alexis Bledel has going for her in this movie are her huge watery blue eyes. The rest feels like throwaway lines for her, I don't even get the sense that she's trying all that hard. Jane Lynch plays her mother and I love Jane Lynch and was sad to see her so poorly utilized. The one-note mother character could have been played by anyone and she never got to flex her comedic muscle. Michael Keaton seemed to be in a different movie than everyone else just being over the top eccentric and I was horrified that his character running over a cat was actually written into this story! It's morbid, awkward, and is only used as a device to get Alexis closer to Rodrigo Santoro who is certainly yummy-looking, but is little else in this. Poor Carol Burnett has probably never sunk lower as Grandma Maureen, a woman who believes she is at death's door and is cranky to everyone but again, not FUNNY. Why have these actors if you're going to use them so badly?? And the best friend played by Zach Gilford is nothing memorable, you will forget his face as soon as the movie ends.

That all being said, the only thing going for this movie is the concept of the wake-up call to young people out there who plan everything out - get good grades, get scholarship, go to college, get good job, live happily ever after. You can do all those steps but your college degree is not worth as much as it used to be. From experience I can say I am a college grad and I am not using my degree. But that led me to starting my own business and I couldn't be happier so you don't know what path you will end up on but keeping an open mind and working hard can get you there. Ryden's naivety is a valid message, but the movie's comedy is weak, the acting is poor, the writing is terrible, and the 30+ minutes of filler with the family that they added just to have a full length film really shows.",1269129600,3,2411,4.320088300220751

Alexis Bledel is an awesome actress, she delivers a fine performance.  But, I didn't like how it ended, particularly the fact that she finally gets the job of her dreams and she gives up everything in order to move to New York to live with her boyfriend who's still in college.  When she asks his father is he thinks she's doing the right thing, I agree with him when he tells her that no matter where she is, she's gonna knock'em dead.  But, in my opinion this movie sends a wrong message: ""It's OK and even expected for a woman to abandon everything she's strived for, just to go after the dreams of her boyfriend"".  Don't give me wrong, I'm not a feminist.  I'm just wondering why most of the time women have to compromise?  What about men?  The worst of it is that women buy that message, no wonder why we get lost in relationships, we think that sacrificing our dreams, our careers is the right thing to do.  This is a cute movie, but I think as parents we have to teach our daughters to be more assertive and make more balanced (brain-heart) decisions in their lives.",1265241600,4,1219,4.377777777777778
4007427,5,B002WN8IPW,"Post Grad is about a girl who is just like many others at this time. She graduated after trying really hard in college and unfortunately finds herself boomeranged back to her parents house, jobless. She is a doer and an achiever and tries to find a place to start her life, even if it means working in jobs that may or may not require a college degree. She, perhaps like a lot of graduates, was so sure of where she was going with her life. She was thrown off course when things didn't work out and along the way she made some right decisions and some wrong ones, but she lived and learned about what is important to her. It is about finding out whats important in life and going after it; whether it be in the work life or the love life. I think that it is a beautiful and uplifting story. Alexis Bledel was the perfect young actress to pick for the part and she did a superb job. I admit that there was some ridiculousness and silliness with her family, but I think it help make the movie uplifting and a lot of fun. I think the movie leaves the viewer with a smile in remembrance.

In response to a previous review, Feminists are people who want equal opportunity for women and men alike. Feminists want women to strive for the best that they can be and live out their lives to the fullest of potentials. The modern Feminist has a much more political tie-in and in point of fact has really nothing to do with the movie. But in terms of traditional feminism there isn't much to complain about. What her father meant was that its okay to take some risks and she has shown herself to be in control of her life even as a child (eating her vegetables without being told) and she was able to achieve her dreams while realizing other dreams, but doesn't that sometimes happen. Okay, so she left, but she remained the same person as she was at home, even when she went away to college, and now in a different city, she will be different? How does that logic make sense? Geography has nothing to do with success. You can fulfill your dreams no matter where you go as long as you have the determination to do so. She has already shown that she is a go getter.

She does everything ""right"" and according to her father in one scene, she even ""ate all her vegetables growing up"".  This ""vegetable scene"" is meant to show that she takes herself too seriously and has been working too hard her entire life (she's 22 years old).  HUGE SPOILER ALERT:  She eventually gets the jobs of her dreams but gives it up in order to move in with her boyfriend who just got into law school.  Apparently she's going to live in his dorm room with him (which to me seems unlikely for a university to allow).  In the ""you always ate your vegetables"" scene, she asks her father if she should ""give up on her dreams and move 3,000 miles away"" and he tells her ""yes"".  So let me get this straight - you worked hard you entire life towards the job of your dreams only to give it up to be unemployed and living in a boyfriend's dorm?

She's been a head-strong person who is very goal oriented and figured out the right way to go about getting what she wanted through High School and then College.  Much like most people, there are those who always seem to drive a person crazy in life, and the character which Alexis plays is no different, having a girl who has always been 1 step ahead of her.

Now not everything is absolutely perfect in her life: her family is weird.  Her younger brother just wants some attention and time of his father who is always busy on some sort of science project, and the mother and grandmother have oddball issues themselves.  Out of all of these characters, I'd have to say that the mother and grandmother who are supposedly in-laws, look far too much alike, and overall - could be done without being in the movie and they wouldn't go much noticed nor missed.  Only real reason for them to really be there is to illustrate why the younger brother is so ""off"".

I don't want to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it (and I really haven't given much of anything away) so I'll just mention that the remaining parts of the movie seem to be off the wall and scattered, but towards the end, everything comes together.

Its a cute movie and quite fun to watch.",1263945600,,1675,4.4267100977198695
4007432,4,B002WN8IPW,"Ryden Malby had it all figured out.  Make good grades in high school, get a great college scholarship, keep the scholarship, graduate, and then work at the best publishing company in LA.  Only things don't go quite as she planned.  Instead of getting the job, she ends up unemployed and living with her crazy family once again.

Crazy is NOT an understatement.

Add on to that, a hot Brazillian neighbor and Adam, a guy who's been her best friend since freshman year, yet wants to be more.  That's the plot.

The plot, while all over the place, works well for this movie.  You're not sure what scheme one of the Malbys will come up with next.  Will it be her father's plan to make a fortune online selling belt buckles or perhaps her grandmother (played by the ever amazing Carol Burnett) wanting to take a look at caskets?  There's always something going on, with Ryden and her love life, or lack thereof, at the center of it all.

This movie defintely takes you for a ride.  One that I really enjoyed.",1263340800,13,1003,4.480662983425415
