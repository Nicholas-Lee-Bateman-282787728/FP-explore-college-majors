You can watch this great artist live in his studio painting. I like to paint along, sort of, and if I get confused, I back it up, and see it again.
It would be incredibly expensive to go to one his workshops, but this is perfect!

7793387,2,092450904X,"Maybe I didn't read the description on this but the camera angles can be poor at times with his hand in the way, and he reminds me of watching the Bob Ross guy on television. Their isn't a whole lot of teaching, but rather, things like... We'll add a tree here, and how about some rocks over here. Henjust talks a lot while he paints. But their isn't much instruction and really this is not a paint along video. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but this definitely failed in my book. And, worse yet is that I bought two different ones and both were done by him! What was I thinking!",1366848000,,584,4.176991150442478
7793388,5,092450904X,"Wonderful presentation by famous artist. There is lot to learn for the beginning watercolorist, and for advanced as well.
I would recommend this VHS tape to everybody. Those who like aquarel painting, or just to look and enjoy Mr. Tony Couch at work.",1308873600,,250,4.837209302325581
7793389,5,092450904X,"This video is very useful to me. When I'm starring at a blank sheet of paper or when I feel like my style is getting too tight, I watch this. It really helps with both. Tony Couch is a pretty good instructor and one of the things I appreciate about him is that when he does something, he tells you why he's doing it. This helps with the mental game of watercolor. Right after I bought it, I painted the painting in the video and then the very next painting I did turned out to be the best I've ever done.",1275004800,6,504,4.0
7793390,4,092450904X,"I borrowed this tape from our library and it is a very good learning source.  Tony Couch is an excellent teacher and employs a style that can be copied by students at all levels.  I have only been painting for less than 1 year but have been able to follow his instructions and am starting to ""get it"". The title was a little misleading for me.  I thought he was going to show various ways to paint water, rocks, and trees but it is actually 1 full demo painting containing each of these elements.  This painting is a bit more confusing that in the other Couch videos I have seen but he tells the viewer what he is trying to do at every step so the insight into his process is worth more than just duplicating this 1 painting.  Tony is very good at demonstrating moisture & value control.  The presentation, editing, and audio in this tape are generally good and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Tony's painting style.",1212624000,3,925,4.348837209302325
7793391,5,092450904X,"My local library had 3 videos by Tony Couch and this was one of them.  Tony Couch studied under Edgar Whitney.  Couch paints quite fast and talks a little fast. This video is great to watch and learn from, and I love the way Tony adds splashes of bright color to his paintings to liven it up.  In this video, he teaches a lot about painting rocks and how to convey rough water among the stream rocks, and also  you will learn about painting trees.  It's a great video, but I might see if it's at the library before I paid $20-30 dollars for it.  I watched it about 4 times,and each time I got something new out of it.",1201305600,5,617,4.1
