Quite good service !
The 1st DVD is perfect for babies. My baby loves it !",1258329600,2,128,3.9615384615384617
2518396,4,B000EGDNDG,"Regardless of the fact that my husband and I think that these videos are the cheesiest thing we have ever seen, our daugther LOVES them.  Lots of repetition and singing which is good for development.  After a while, however, you will get really tired of seeing everyone in the park.....again.  That being said, we stick with what makes her happy! Enjoy!",1218672000,2,353,4.754098360655738
2518397,5,B000EGDNDG,"My 2-1/2 yr old daughter loves this video and sings the songs often. The animations are fairly simple and they speak slowly and clearly so it's easy to understand. My daughter is high-functioning autistic with a speech delay and this has been a great tool to increasing her language skills. The repetition is very helpful, but there is also playful banter between the characters. They take the alphabet in segments like ABCD, EFG, HIJK...and give 2 examples for each letter such as a Cat eating Cake, the Giraffe is playing Guitar. Great learning video that is fun, too.",1186963200,2,570,4.826530612244898
2518398,2,B000EGDNDG,"This is the most annoying video in our collection.  It's not annoying in the way that Barney is annoying.  It's annoying for its low production value and because it's utterly inane.  Now I'm pretty forgiving of children's educational videos, but this one really drives me crazy.  Let me give you an example.  There's a running joke in the ABC section where the little boy character falls down (standing flat-footed on even ground, he inexplicably falls down).  This running joke is repeated 26 times--once for every letter of the alphabet.  My toddler tittered the first time this happened.  But even that joke wore thin for him.

The producers of this video should be forced to watch it scores of times, because that's what parents have to contend with.  Other than that, my toddler loves this video.  Loves it!  Wants to watch it over and over and over!  The horror!",1182038400,,868,4.783783783783784
2518399,2,B000EGDNDG,"My daughter was very disappointed with this DVD.  She didn't even make it past the first half hour because she said it was so boring.  She kept saying - ""when are they finally doing something else"".  My daughter is 3 1/2 - I did not realize this DVD was intended from INFANT to four years of age - there is  barely any action.  I am sure it is good for younger children, for older kids it just does not hold their attention - but - maybe it started getting better after half an hour - we will not know since my daughter decided to not finish it.",1172620800,,545,4.05607476635514
2518400,5,B000EGDNDG,My three year old son was having trouble with his letters and with his counting.  This DVD is incredible.  All four programs feature the Barneyesque Puppy Dog character that my son immediately took to.  The programs are fun and communicate in very simple effective ways.  This is hours of edutainment that you can feel good about having your child watch.  My son has already mastered his counting and is improving on his letters...all thanks to Puppy Dog. A++++++,1151539200,8,463,4.884615384615385
2518401,5,B000EGDNDG,"I have a 5 year old with autism.  For a long time we were trying to teach him his colors without much success.  I bought the video to pair his therapy and the video.  He now can label colors as well as object colors.  This is a great tape.  If it wasn't for the tape, I don't know where we would be teaching our son what other kids can pick up so quickly.",1073779200,,355,3.808219178082192
2518422,5,B000EGDNDG,"I wish these DVD's were available here on line in Polish, too.  I got their download in Polish from Polish website and my little girl loves them.  They teach basic vocabulary of animal names, colors, shapes and more.  Done in a very gentle way with singing and music, animation and real pictures, good amount of repetition and even word display on the screen.  These movies are nice to watch over and over again, to ensure learning through repetion.  Worth the money.",1355443200,,467,4.716049382716049
2518423,1,B000EGDNDG,"If I could rate this DVD a zero, I would do so in a heartbeat. What were the people thinking who collaborated on this video? It's inexplicably annoying. I mean, there's a little boy in the video who keeps falling down when almost every letter is introduced. At first, my four year and five year old were like, ""Oookaay."" But then it got to a point where they didn't even want to watch the video anymore. This DVD is too long to keep a four or five year old's attention span because it is just too distracting. I ended up chucking this video and buying a simpler one (Alphabet Inky) that gets right down to learning the ABCs, and is much more engaging for my kids.",1348444800,,663,4.26984126984127
2518424,5,B000EGDNDG,"My 2 year old loves these videos.  They do tend to repeat the same words a dozen times, but that may be the great part of them.  Teaches letters, shapes, colors...  Definitely helped my little one to learn all her ABCs, etc. :)",1322265600,,227,4.232558139534884
2518425,4,B000EGDNDG,"These are not exactly the best quality DVD's, but for the price you can't go wrong. It will keep your little one busy for a good while, especially with its repeat play!",1321574400,,168,4.28125
2518426,1,B000EGDNDG,"My husband and I find the videos to be a bit concerning. The young girls in the movie are wearing short dresses, and their underwear is visible when they are sitting. In the shapes video, one of the girls is wearing a dress with a see-through top. I think these things are not appropriate to have in a children's program like this. They should have screened it for things like this.
The kids won't notice it, but as a parent, like I said, I don't think it's quite right.",1315094400,,470,4.292134831460674
2518427,5,B000EGDNDG,"My 21 month old LOVES the Puppy Dog videos, with exception to the baseball one which seems to be geared towards slightly older kids, he's got NO interest in that. He's enjoyed these for a couple of months now. They are annoying, but my little one loves it and begs for it constantly so I have to give it a good review. I also have to admit I do think it has helped with his speech. These videos are clearly for YOUNG CHILDREN who are in the process of just learning to talk. My son is under 2, but he talks constantly, so he is at the right age for this. If not trying to talk, they may be bored, and a child who already speaks very well will probably be EXTREMELY bored. Keep this in mind when deciding if this video is for you. Oh, and the reason they are boring is they are EXTREMELY repetitive (especially the music), very slow speaking parts, and some of the running jokes (a boy falls down out of nowhere for no good reason ALL the time) can get extremely old and don't seem funny at all to an adult...and yes my son does now mimic the ""falling down boy"" all the time which I'm not crazy about, but all in all the video is harmless and will help a young child learn to talk so I am happy to have them.",1311638400,,1207,4.054393305439331

2518429,5,B000EGDNDG,our baby loves this.. she is 15 months old. i think this is good for kids from 9 months to 30 months.,1284336000,,101,3.6363636363636362
2518430,1,B000EGDNDG,This thing looks like it was made when computer graphics 1st came out.  The quality is so poor and it's super annoying.,1272412800,,119,4.409090909090909
2518431,5,B000EGDNDG,"My 2 year old can sit for hours watching these dvds.  And he is really improving in his words and sentences.  I know every child is different, but he really responds to these DVDs (although they are very annoying to the parent!)  Since he has already learned all the words on baby phonics, I plan on giving it to my cousin who's baby needs more encouragement to speak (it helped my son in that manner...I could hear him practicing the words while in his bed!)",1265155200,3,459,4.376470588235295
8109439,5,B000EGDNDG,I originally got this dvd from blockbuster video on a going out of sale liquidation while I was pregnant in 2009. My son is brilliant we played that movie day and night. Now I have a daughter Im frantically looking for it and its not easy to find nor is it on YouTube for more than 5 mins. Im gonna buy it again . Im looking for the combo disk that I originally had with colors shapes and numbers. GET IT!!!!,1516320000,,408,4.049382716049383
8109440,5,B000EGDNDG,Great educational DVD for the kids and keeps them interested every moment. I would most definitely recommend,1467331200,,108,5.411764705882353
8109441,5,B000EGDNDG,Excellent show about counting and singing. Daughter loves it!,1446163200,,61,5.888888888888889
8109442,5,B000EGDNDG,I love this DVD..... My son is 2 years old and he watches it day in and day out. It is educational as well as interactive for him. I have had the DVD for about 4 months now and he knows his colors hands down. He knows how to count to ten and number recognition as well. We are working on his alphabet but he can recognize some of them. Great investment!,1441756800,,353,3.9166666666666665
8109443,5,B000EGDNDG,This set of DVDs are a must have for your baby!! My 6 month old just loved to watch them all!! Great first set of learning tools! Nice a slow not too much for little ones!!,1410652800,,172,3.8055555555555554
8109444,5,B000EGDNDG,"I gave these to my grandson for gift, he love them and they held him alot to learn how to count his age 2.",1403827200,,106,3.4583333333333335
8109445,5,B000EGDNDG,"I found only 1 clip of the ABC dvd on youtube once, and my daughter LOVED it. So I searched for that DVD and found this whole set! Totally worth it! My daughter (between 1-2 years at the time) always asked for ""Puppy Dog"". She knew her ABCs and some colors before 2 years old. Now shes 2.5 and smarted than a cookie with milk. I have already passed these along to another Mom, but I definitely recommend! (I'm one of those moms who don't like mainstream sesame street and etc!)",1394582400,,477,4.252747252747253
8109446,5,B000EGDNDG,"These videos are a big hit with my twins who are three years old.  They love Puppy dog, laugh, and have a lot of fun watching these videos.  Also, very important to me, improvement in speech delay.  It's common for twins to be behind in speech.  But after watching these videos for a month I saw a huge improvement.

They also learned their basic shapes and colors.  One of my twins who still doesn't talk well is still able to pick out colors and shapes if asked.  I will ask him to find something green for example and he'll go grab something of that color and bring it back.

I give these movies five stars because they are great learning videos.  Even taught my boys (encouraged them) to answer me when I ask a question.  I would definitely tell parents to get these even if your child isn't speech delayed because they are fun for kids and great learning tools.  I get a bit tired of puppy dog...but its worth it to see them learn so quickly.",1385596800,,947,4.293785310734464
8109447,5,B000EGDNDG,"Bought for my 1 yo grandson.  He loved them and they would calm him right down if he were frustrated.  He also learned all the words, letters and colors.  He loves them and I find them relaxing also.  Grandson +2 is now watching and loving.  He is 8 mos.  best purchase I made for them.  When I need a gift it will  be puppy dog videos.  IMO I love them especially through a child's eye.  Just perfect.",1383523200,,402,4.103896103896104
8109448,4,B000EGDNDG,"So utterly and completely annoying for me but my 10 month old son absolutely Loves the dvd's.  The best one of the bunch is ABC's.  We put this in about every other day during our naptime prep. He will sit and smile at Puppydog and gets so excited when he hears the music.
I find it disturbing that they have the boy character fall each letter but then again this is not the best quality production. It serves its educational purpose. I purchased the ABC dvd on its own for my 8 month old neice and she likes it, too.",1356652800,,517,4.16
