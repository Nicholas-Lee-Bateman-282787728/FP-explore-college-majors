8324890,5,B0007YJGL8,"Skillful representation of a handful of combinations of the art and sport of Savate. As a Movement Specialist I know that it is just as important to view great movers as it it to collect combinations. The multiple angles the various speeds allow you to see the difference in the execution of skills used by all Savateurs. It is the body position shift, the sequencing of joint motions the timing and organization of combinations can tech more than just a list of techniques. Everyone uses the basics; it is the execution that is the difference in a professionals performance.",1306627200,,575,4.818181818181818
8324891,3,B0007YJGL8,"After a year of training Savate there was very little this DVD offered for me.

Chouaref if clearly highly skilled in this sport but the DVD is just too short and contains way too little pointers and the combinations taught are for the most part too typical.

Bonuses included 3 clips from combat savate matches, of which 2 were pointless almost-instant knock-outs.",1189728000,3,365,4.870967741935484
