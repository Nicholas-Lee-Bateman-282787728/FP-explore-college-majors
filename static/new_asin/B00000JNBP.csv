1235360,5,B00000JNBP,"Eddie Murphy truly shines in this collection of SNL sketches. Move over Jackie Gleason, I think this video deserves the title The Great One. One highlight to look forward to is Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood. Eddie is hilarious as an adult version of Mr. Rogers, and the sketch features a cameo by Mr. T.  Another classic is James Brown's Celebrity Hot Tub Party, although it s actually quite short. A gem that is not as famous is a sketch called Rock and Roll And Then Some, with Joe Piscopo as host. Eddie plays his guest who claims to be the 5th Beatle. It really is a hilarious sketch. They even poke fun at the ""Paul's Dead"" hoax, which is a great part of the sketch. Opie's Back is also a hilarious sketch, and I think the rest of it should have been included. Finally, there is the legendary White Like Me sketch, where Murphy becomes a white man and finds that whites and blacks are still different. So overall, this is a very good video.",994809600,12,943,4.419540229885057
1235361,4,B00000JNBP,"It is extremely rare to use the words ""Eddie Murphy"" and ""clean"" in the same sentence, which ring true in ""Saturday Night Live-The Best Of Eddie Murphy"". After watching Murphy convey such a unique and endearing comical warmth in which he brings to many of his SNL characters, especially in this video, it makes you wonder why Murphy resorts to using rather obscene language and risque adult themes prevalent in many of his stand-up comedy videos, such as ""Eddie Murphy:Raw"" and ""Delirious"", which are highly recommended for laughs, even though these are not satisfactory for young audiences to view. If Mr. Murphy cleaned up his act in the language department, he'd still be just as hilarious. On the other hand, if the adult themes and language were excluded entirely, the routines wouldn't be as interesting and much of their viewer appeal would be lost. No need to worry with ""The Best Of Eddie Murphy-Saturday Night Live"". It's ""G"" rating means that it's a video the whole family can watch together, although there is a slight possibility that the ethnicity present in certain skits may offend certain people, so it's best to watch this with an open mind and just laugh out loud! The only thing I dislike about this version is due to the fact there are two different skits, one that replaced the jazz skit where Murphy portrays a ""Thelonius Monk""-type musician, sporting a clear plastic mask, which I found quite hilarious! Instead there's a drone skit with Eddie dressed up as Gumby, saying the oft-used phrase ""I'm Gumby, Dammit!"" Somebody please gag me with a spoon! Another skit featured here that wasn't in the original video was a different second skit of ""Mister Robinson's Neighborhood"" featuring Mr. T. Even though I don't remember the original second skit that was in the original video, I would say the Mr. T skit is/was as equally as funny. The most hilarious skit of the bunch here is definitely the ""Jesse Jackson"" skit. You'll have to check that one out for yourself! You rarely see any clean, wholesome and comical productions starring Eddie Murphy that are out there, which is why it is necessary to include ""The Best Of Eddie Murphy-Saturday Night Live"" in your comedy video library. Purchase this rare gem before it is taken out of print!",976838400,4,2261,4.844961240310077

1235393,5,B00000JNBP,"Eddie Murphy is considered by many to be the best Saturday Night Live castmember of all time and one of the funniest comedians ever to walk on stage. He ranks right up there with John Belushi and Adam Sandler. SNL was like it was these days; running out of ideas. Murphy joined the cast and instilled new life and outrageous, sometimes risky comedy to the legendary sketch comedy show. Playing hilarious characters like Gumby, Buckwheat, and James Brown, Murphy was absolutely laugh out loud funny. Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood was a masterpiece that is still talked about to this day! Murphy's brand of comedy reminds me a LOT of either MadTV or In Living Color. If you like either of those shows, you will love this collection. This DVD also includes bloopers and a photo gallery.

Guess what, they not only sent the VHS but also included a DVD.  So I was able to get all of the skits that reviewers complained this DVD does not have.  I ordered it from Amazon and I selected the VHS from Miss Marybooks.  I did not purchase the $95 one but the used VHS for $13 but as I said I got a free DVD.  This is a great buy and the skits are hilarious.

PS-I am only rating this DVD because I cannot submit the comment without it, but just wanted to let everyone know if you want to get the other as a DVD, order the VHS (I will always give Eddie 5 stars).  See the vendor above.",1337040000,,740,3.9194630872483223
1235524,4,B00000JNBP,This dvd was really funny. I love eddie murphy. It arrived on time and in the condition that was stated.,1324252800,,104,4.25
1235525,3,B00000JNBP,"Having seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beverly-Hills-Cop/dp/B0029OMEYK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beverly Hills Cop</a>&nbsp;about 10 times and knowing that Eddie Murphy was a good comic in his day, I thought I couldn't go far wrong getting a 'best of'. However (as 'christ_monkey' has pointed out) this is not necessarily his finest material and most of the sketches are 80's satire, rather than timeless classics.

To be fair there are flashes of brilliance, such as the Jesse Jackson 'Hymietown' Motown parody, the 'become a ho' skit, the 5th member of the Beatles interview, AND (best of all) the Mr White mockumentary. The last two of these are definitely classics and the mockmentary of Eddie Murphy donning white make-up and spying on white-folk has to be one of the best skits I've seen in a while.

Unfortunately there is also a lot of material that has aged & some which is just not funny. An example of this is the 'Buck Wheat' shooting which seems to be a parody of news channel's showing the same clips of assassinations over and over and over, but just comes over as lengthy and boring (to the point where I fast forwarded about 5 minutes of it). There is also other drivel, like a sketch where Murphy is dressed as a big green pork chop and one where he talks with a guy in a pub dressed as an old man.

There are other bits and pieces such as 'Black History minute', some Stevie Wonder parodies and various outtakes, but about 70% of the DVD is worth avoiding as the references are now obscure and the material is often poor.

So, if you want a decent DVD of Eddie Murphy, then I'd recommend his stand-up material (esp&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raw/dp/B0002XP0GE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raw</a>) over this stuff any day.

1235529,5,B00000JNBP,"These clips are from a time when SNL was the biggest thing to ever happen to television. And then it died. Then it came back hipper and edgier than ever thanks to Eddie Murphy. So much of culture has changed since then, but if you know your cultural history, this disc will amaze you.

Eddie is still the most lucrative movie star ever and the biggest star to emerge from SNL. He combined acerbic wit, razor-sharp performance and creativity (he helped write all of his sketches, unlike many SNL legends). He is also the only black SNL member to dominate the show in popularity and appear in non-demeaning, safe-for-white America roles. Only after Eddie, did mediocre talents swarm to SNL in hopes of superstardom. So you really are catching the show at its most raw, vital and inspired here. And funniest.

The most legendary moment in the 70s SNL was seeing Belushi, Chase, Murray and Aykroyd in the same sketch. In the 80s, it has to be the on-screen union of Murphy, Martin Short, Billy Crystal and Christopher Guest (with Larry David in the background!).

ANYONE with a comedy collection should grab this.",1261267200,,1109,4.7357512953367875
1235548,4,B00000JNBP,"One of the most talented comedic performers to come out of SNL was undoubtedly Eddie Murphy. He brought an intensity back to the show during the early 80's that hadn't been seen since John Belushi & Dan Aykroyd were there. And in truth, he kept the show going when others were wagging their heads about how dismal the show had become. All the hilarious performances are here: Buckwheat, his grumpy cigar-chomping Gumby, ""The James Brown Hottub Experience"" & even his ghetto take of Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood.
As with other SNL collections, it doesn't feel quite complete, and I'm sure there's some good material missing here. But Murphy is so edgy & fun that it doesn't matter too much. Of course, he went on to superstardom in movies, but it's always nice to look back at the launching pad--in this case, SNL--to see where it all began.",1261008000,,839,4.7534246575342465

1235550,3,B00000JNBP,"Like many other people, I feel ripped off that this DVD is missing material previously available on VHS, and cannot imagine any reason other than stifling political correctness on the part of NBC. While there are still some skits with a few controversial moments included here, most of this DVD is more tame that Murphy was at his hilarious zenith. Nonetheless, I have tried to be objective and rate this DVD as it is and as if earlier released material was not a factor. On that basis I have given the DVD three stars. Some of the sketches are wonderful (I never cease laughing at Murphy's Gumby, Buckwheat, or Mr. Robinson,) but some are only so-so, which is a problem in other ""Saturday Night Live"" DVD's as well. The single biggest obstacle to this series of SNL DVD's becoming classics, in my opinion, is the consistently poor selection of skits.

This DVD also has some entertaining bloopers and outtakes in the extras, but fails to live up to its potential. While I am a fan of Eddie Murphy (he really was the only worthwhile attraction on SNL during the 1980's,) this set could and should have been much better than it is. The disc is cheap, and is generally entertaining for the 66 minutes of running time. On that basis I recommend it to dyed in the wool SNL or Eddie Murphy fans. If you want some true Eddie Murphy genius though, I recommend as an alternative to this ""Coming to America"" or ""Trading Places,"" two timeless movies highlighting Murphy's comedic deftness.",1241913600,3,1479,4.645038167938932

1235555,5,B00000JNBP,"This is Eddie Murphy before all of the family friendly movies which have seemed to define his career as of late.  This is an edgy & extremeley funny Murphy. Here are some highlights: There is the Eddie as Jessie Jackson, clamoring for Jewish votes in a very not so politically correct sketch.  There is Eddie as BuckWheat which, while funny, also has a serious undertone concerning the sensationalization of topics in the media. There is Eddie as Velvet Jones, who simply wants to help women get out of their ""ho-hum"" lives and into meaning employment.  There is Eddie as James Brown, and it's simply classic.  There is Eddie as Stevie Wonder (and Joe Piscapoe as Frank Sinatra) in another classic skit.  I dare you not to laugh!  All in all, this is Eddie as a starving artist.

But where the DVD redeemed itself was on the inclusion of a Gumby skit (I didn't care which one, I couldn't believe they didn't include one on the VHS and I wanted Gumby, dammit!), the prison film in which the poet recites the ever-popular and billiant poem, ""Kill My Landlord"" (C-I-L-L my landlord), and Stevie Wonder playing a nerd trying to do a Stevie Wonder impersonation, only to be taught by Eddie how to do Stevie.  So they taketh away with one hand, and giveth with the other.  Could they have included ALL of them, and then some, on a new DVD?  OF COURSE THEY COULD!  And why didn't they?  Good question.  But to be fair to the DVD, I welcomed the new inclusions.  Just don't get rid of your old VHS.  If it was ALL in one, it would be 5 stars.

I could see that thing 100 times and i would still laugh as hard as the first time seeing it! i stand buy the greatness of that sketch, SNL was riding the Eddie Murphy thing all the way to the bank ( the show would most likley been canceled, in my opinion, the show was unwatchable without him an piscapo teamed up).

then to make this thing worse is that the VHS version had zero Gumby sketches in it ( still great without it thought). i see they have a Gumby sketch in the dvd version, i think ""oh, cool, a Gumby dammit segment"", but it ends up being one of the lamest one's around.  what, they didn't want to pay piscapo the royalties for showing the one where Gumby goes on Letterman (Piscapo as letterman)?

My particular favorite piece (Eddie playing a rastafarian singing ""we're gonna kill da white people"" at a meeting of mostly white VFW members) is NOT on this DVD along with a number of others.

BUT - Does anybody remember Eddie doing an absolutely amazing impression of JERRY LEWIS?? Where is this sketch at?? He played a younger Jerry Lewis and Joe Piscopo played an older version and it is called 'Jerry Lewis's School of Comedy' or something like that. It is one of the funniest sketches in SNL history. Eddie played Jerry so dead-on perfect that he actually caused Joe to stop the sketch and bust out laughing at one point - its hilarious! :D  That and Eddie did a lot of Gumby skits that was funnier than what is on the DVD. I don't think SNL did this justice at all. And where was 'KILL THE WHITE PEOPLE' at??? Or what about 'Ugly People Sex'?? Shame on SNL.,1125360000,21,780,4.379310344827586
1235599,1,B00000JNBP,"I saw the original VHS years ago when it came out and it was great. So how come in this day and age of DVD digital storage does this DVD come off as a total rip off? Let me explain: Firstly, it's not complete I mean where is ""James Brown is Annie"", ""Kill the White People"" and other sketches contained on the original VHS cassette? Since one can store more on a DVD than a VHS why didn't the producers of this DVD not make a simple transferral of the VHS cassette? As a consumer one expects quality and since many of the VHS excerpts are missing how can you possibly refer to it as The Best of Eddie Murphy (Bonus Edition) when the VHS format from years ago was vastly superior?

I don't understand why this DVD collection is at least not a verbatim copy of the VHS cassette. They could of then added extras to it and hailed it as something special.  I'm sure there would have been enough space on the DVD to incorprate all of the VHS cassette and then some extras making it a DVD worth having.

As it stands I now have to buy the original VHS cassete in order to enjoy my favourite sketches of Eddie Murphy. Thereby having good video quality (DVD) alongside an outdated format of inferior quality (VHS) and paying double the money.

I'm pretty sure Eddie Murphy had nothing to do with the production of this DVD he probably does not own the rights to his SNL years. I find it an insult to him and to the consumer not to give the public the best possible product which in this day and age is possible.

I regret having bought the DVD version and had I known sketches were missing I would not have purchased it at all.

""The Best Of Eddie Murphy"" basically collects Eddie's most memorable moments from the show, including three Buckwheat bits, Gumby's ""Merry Christmas, Dammit!"" (unfortunately this sketch is severely edited), ""Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood"" ""Pudge And Solomon"" (with Joe Piscopo, the only other truly talented regular during the 1980-84 seasons), Velvet Jones and the short film ""White Like Me"" in which Eddie goes undercover as a white man. To entice hardcore fans who religiously watched the show just for Eddie every week, they've included rare sketches like ""Big Damn Plastic Bubble"" and ""Rock And Roll And Then Some"" (with Eddie as a black man claiming to be the fifth Beatle). All of these sketches are lively and hilarious.

To be fair, this dvd does not include all of Eddie's best. There are no ""Focus On Film"" sketches with Raheem Abdoul Mohammed (a character Eddie played 10 times) or any of his Michael Jackson, Bill Cosby or Mr. T impressions.

1235604,5,B00000JNBP,"While the long-running SNL still occasionally shows signs of brilliance, the series reached its apex with the addition of Eddie Murphy to the cast in the early 80's. Murphy was definitely ""hungry"" and his brand of satirical impersonations fit the SNL format beautifully. He was dead-on when he took on the personas of Buckwheat, Stevie Wonder, Little Richard Simmons, and Mr. Robinson. He, single-handedly, with his Jewish-tongued incarnation, revived the long-forgotten claymation creation Gumby. These ""bits"" just attest to the talent that was about to erupt on the big screen a few years later.

Murphy's fame and popularity on SNL brought him to Hollywood like his predecessors Dan Aykroyd,Bill Murray,Chevy Chase and the late John Belushi. While on SNL,Murphy filmed the Paramount movies BEST DEFENSE with the late Dudley Moore and TRADING PLACES with Aykroyd and Jamie Lee Curtis.

1235617,5,B00000JNBP,"After 5 years of classic comedy, ""Saturday Night Live"" entered a cold streak in 1980. Heavyhitters like John Belushi and Gilda Radner were replacd with Gail Matthius and Charles Rocket, and Jean Domanian (and later Dick Ebersol) replaced the show's guiding force, exceutive porducer Lorne Michaels. The results: bad reviews and the show's worst ratings. The show needed someone to revive the show's magic. Someone who could elicit guffaws in even the worst sketch. They found that in 19 - year old comedian Eddie Murphy.
Murphy's best moments in his 3 - year stint on the show are all on this 28 - sketch set. Whether you enjoy ""Buckwheat"", ""Gumby"", or ""Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood"", there'll never be a more comprehensive Eddie Murphy/""SNL"" retrospectie. Also, a lot of less popular sketches are here. ""Buckwheat Shot"" and ""Buckwheat Dead"" (one of the few 2- part ""SNL"" skecthes) is among the show's greatest staircal news parodies. Eddie does the Little Rascal flawlessly, while Joe Piscopo does a dead - on Ted Koppell. (Piscopo is actually in most of the sketches, probably because he brough out the best in Murphy). Also, a variety pf his classxci impressions are here: Desmond Tutu, James Brown, Stevie Wonder (the real wonder pops up in the final sketch), Jesse Jackson and others. I wish they'd included his Michael Jackson impression, though. Another plus: Eddie's hilarious Little Richard Simmons, a sidesplitting amalgam of Little Richard and Richard Simmons that most likely inspired Dana Carvey's Carsenio. And the classic short film ""White Like Me"" is here. The makeup artists did a great job of making Eddie look white.
This dvd is also special because it's Eddie's cleanest material aside from ""Shrek"" and ""Doctor Dolittle"". Aside from a few curses, everything here is tame compared to his movies and standup routines. I suggest this dvd for all comedy fans.

Buckwheat also appears in anaother skit with the Duwpemes, and Murphy does a rather messed - up version of ""Reach Out And Somebody's Hand"".
This is not all the classic sketches. Velvet Jones, the author of several different sexual novels is shown in 3 very funny sketches.

1235623,5,B00000JNBP,"Twenty-six years ago, New York City introduced a weekly program that offered a range of live, staged satires and up-to-date humorous accounts and depictions of broad topics that built their foundations on contemporary issues, such as politics, the entertainment industry and promotions. This then-subtle program, Saturday Night Live, proceeded to light up the Neilson boards, despite it's awkward presentation of showtimes.
After a promising half-decade of success, give or take, SNL opened it's arms to 19 year-old funnyman Eddie Murphy. For the next few years, the young adult worked his magic on sketches that include Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood, an irresistable laughfest that spoofed Mr. Roger's Neighborhood by placing a rude, self-centered young man in a lower class apartment, where he taught children how to be judgmental and critical of everyone. The two episodes of Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood featured on the videotape exemplify exactly what great comedy is: a well-thought dialogue with substance and dignity that leads the viewer(s) to laugh so hard, he/she may be prompted to shed tears or even choke.
When it comes to the household characters that Eddie Murphy rewarded us with during his tenure on SNL, an older, more vocal Buckwheat of The Little Rascals stepped up to the plate and hit a home run in comedy. There was an uncanny resembelence in physical appearance and in age progression. One can't help but laugh at Buckwheat's ability to stammer and struggle with the English language. In the SNL History Book, Eddie Murphy's portrayal of Buckwheat will forever reign as the symbol of suitable and funny latenight comedy.
When speaking of Eddie's latenight career, his imitation of Stevie Wonder ranks third. Eddie perfectly interprets the surreal and peculiar common movements and the musical brilliance of Stevie Wonder. During the real Wonder's days of fame, spectators globally adored his music, but questioned his unconventional movements. Some fans pondered what went on through his head, as he performed (did his motions help him or were they uncontrollable?, et cetera). Eddie showed us Stevie Wonder, from the inside and from the outside. Acting today struggles to be that convincing and effective when one actor portrays a public figure.
And if these three practically flawless works of Eddie Murphy weren't enough, prepare to laugh consistently with his mocking of Gumby and Richard Simmons, just to identify a few.
The vast majority of this videocassette delivers jokes that are appropriate for younger audiences, with occasional exceptions (Velvet Jones). The often offensive and utterly disgusting SNL of the 21st Century could learn much from Eddie Murphy's displays of talent that he fills us with in 'Saturday Night Live: The Best of Eddie Murphy.'
