8060671,5,B0009HBPD0,The video arrived on time and in good condition. This is a cute store about a group of kids trying to help someone and getting into trouble. The teacher jumps to conclusions that are false and everyone learns a lesson.,1427414400,,218,4.475
8060672,1,B0009HBPD0,"It would play and stop, play and stop, play and stop.  We never got to see the whole movie.  The DVD was a big dissapointment to my 5 year old grandson.  He couldn't understand why a new movie that just came in the mail would not work.",1265587200,,235,3.9574468085106385
8060673,5,B0009HBPD0,My boys age 7 & 9 really enjoy both the books and DVD's.  Great fun and family values.,1250985600,,86,3.7777777777777777
8060674,5,B0009HBPD0,Once again we find the Sugar Creek gang in a funny adventure with some tones of serious. While not the book it is still a very fun show that children of all ages should enjoy. And who knows perhaps it will encourage a child here and there to start reading the books and that is never a bad thing.,1247356800,,296,4.033898305084746
8060675,1,B0009HBPD0,This DVD was a total waste of money. The plot was boring and the children acting in the movie had bad attitudes. Not at all what we expected from the Sugar Creek Gang. I'm glad we only bought this title. Had this DVD been good we were planning to purchase the entire series.,1167782400,6,274,4.188679245283019
