2814480,5,B000P7V6UQ,"This documentary provides interesting information about one of the most brutal and feared organizations in history.  The creators of this documentary use a great deal of historical information and points of view of various historians (including members of the Catholic Church at the Vatican).  Interesting, exciting, shoking, and sad.  The Inquistion, like other terrible organizations in history, carried its very own genocide over several centuries. The saddest thing is that it was done in the name of God.",1184976000,21,509,5.5

2814482,1,B000P7V6UQ,"I just watched the episode on Montaillou, and I was not impressed at all. I'm a medieval historian, and while this episode gets the details essentially correct, it completely misses the big picture. Much of this episode is based on Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie's book, which isn't very good. Moreover, one of their ""experts"" in fact wrote a NOVEL on Montaillou, probably based on Ladurie's book. Finally, I saw no indication that this episode relied on any inquisitorial files opened in 1998--it all came from Ladurie. So be careful with this series, and don't get too caught up in the ""Dark Ages"" mindset. No one who's versed in historical study would take this episode very seriously.",1183420800,33,681,4.879310344827586
2814483,5,B000P7V6UQ,"With every school shooting and other tragic events, the cry resurfaces for prayer in public schools and the posting of the 10 commandments and other religious talismans. Additionally, these magic cures are said to ward off all evil. The truth is that the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution forbid those things because of the dangers of pitting one religion against another.

The Sunni vs. Shia, the problems in Northern Ireland, plus India/Pakistan and many other conflicts are directly caused by religious tension. The founding fathers took great care not to establish a theocracy for the dangers that, that system of governing can produce, thus eliminating the mention of God or Christianity anywhere within the law of the land.

Secret Files of the Inquisition brings this point home better than anything I have ever seen . . . . WELL DONE PBS!",1180310400,28,864,5.034965034965035
2814484,5,B000P7V6UQ,"The middle ages were deadly times for all who did not bow to the religion du jour.  It is hard to wrap one's mind around this miniseries: it portrays the irrationality of believers of any faith, whether it is the jewish culture's rituals or chritian culture's.  Surely, if there were a god, she would not have sanctioned the evil that was done in god's name, with the might of the government to enforce it.

Sad that mankind may not have come too far from such government-sanctioned hatred.  The treatment of jews by the catholic fascists was not too different from the islamo-fascists trying to have their way today, with similar results for infidels.

As Ayn Rand said, faith and force are the destroyers of the world.",1179360000,24,720,4.682539682539683

2814487,5,B000P7V6UQ,"...has immeasurable value to those who wish to understand where our Western ideas of religion originated, and where they are likely to lead us if whe choose to ignore the lessons of the past. All history has lessons to teach. I tried watching this on Free Documentaries Online as I normally do before purchasing a DVD... if it's good, I purchase it. If not, no harm done. However, the film was no longer available, and judging by the the comments, I could imagine why. Certain individuals didn't want this PBS documentary shown - which is an attitude I find incredibly ridiculous as any school child who has ever taken a world history course will undoubtedly be familiar with the topic. Not to mention, this film was produced by PBS based on files released by the Catholic church. It behooves us to pay attention. I'll be showing this to our adult children next time we have a movie night together (I was able to view part 1 online and found the subject matter relevant and the film well made).",1375574400,4,994,4.589887640449438

This is a small handful of facts, picked seemingly at random, pasted together with a patois of drama and pseudo-history. The PBS site for the series lists among its bibliography James Carroll, Mark Pegg, both of whose work on the medieval church is spotty at best. One of the 'experts' on the series is a novelist who apparently read one source during her undergraduate work. Clearly PBS was not particularly rigorous in its research.

The series also seems happy to present events from a single (and somewhat myopic) viewpoint. For example, in presenting the Albigensian Crusade, it is suggested that the devastation of the Languedoc was the intent of the Church, and utterly ignores the machinations of the French nobles, only to eager to sweep in and reclaim lands long under the control of English. It is just this convenient ignorance of the context of events, together with a seeming reliance on the same old sensationalism surrounding the Inquisition, which is itself a product of protestant and subsequent romantic literary and historic traditions. All in all, enjoy this for entertainment value, but don't look to this series for anything resembling actual history.",1310860800,8,1354,5.765
2814489,5,B000P7V6UQ,"This is certainly one of the most important historical exposes'of the under belly of Christianity. The details are chilling and frightening, the tortured sufferings of so many innocents by the man of God is beyond nightmares, it really happened and all those people really experienced it. The perpetrators of these atrocities are gone now,but this horror will not be forgotten. Forgiveness for these church sanctioned mass homicides will help the contemporary Christian cope, but it will never erase this darkest era in human history of the people of God. This beggars description,words seem so inadequate for the reality this report reveals.",1275177600,10,642,5.366336633663367
2814490,1,B000P7V6UQ,"I hate this new tendency since the web and the 90's that everyone has the ""right"" to go and re-write history to push their own agenda on the mass, isn't what the Nazi's tried to do in the 30's and 40's by destroying all the books? (Now instead we WE RE-WRITE history instead, because we are so much more civilized then they where back then...) Why is it o.k. for someone today to go and re-write the History of the Crusades and the Inquisition in a 100% negative light?  Was the author living back then, did he experience it all?  History is always many shades of gray, then shouldn't the Crusades and the Inquisition also be shades of gray.

Once studied in details, we can learn that they had mostly beneficial results, but a few lost souls did some terrible things during that time, must we NOW judge them ALL to damnation only for a few lost souls who caused some trouble?  Then, hopefully, we can expect to be judge as a heretical and a lost generation of depraved sick twisted generation in future history for our CURRENT misdeeds made by a few of our current  leaders.

As for this DVD, R. P. Poletti and Deborah E. Gerish's reviews are accurate in their descriptions.",1256860800,7,1175,4.4672897196261685
2814491,5,B000P7V6UQ,"David Rabinovitch presents the thoroughly collated Vatican archive data open to public in 1998 since some secret files of the nowadays the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith known previously as the Holy Inquisition, had partly been unlocked.

With mostly emphasis on the medieval Catholic anti-Judaic activities, this doco significantly dismantles modern fairytales of an official equity much grounding the universal human rights UN documents even in the First World places of which inhabitants educated apart in schools segregated upon particular religious/biological merits: secularism is a dream only for grown-ups in own dogmas and prejudices.

This work is very educative both from a view of both spiritual and historical information, as modern interviews were professionally located into all segments of a four-part film created and available to date.",1254787200,4,865,5.6976744186046515
2814492,5,B000P7V6UQ,"In 2004 John Paul II made an apology for the sins of the inquisition - was he wrong?  Based upon what this series presents I believe the evidence is conclusive - it tells of the true greatness of this Pope for admitting to the sins that were committed in the name of Christ and the Catholic Church.  By releasing these archives, wrongs perpetrated by the church can be brought to light and assessed.  By producing this series, PBS did a wonderful job of sharing these files and bringing to light not only the religious-political issues of these periods, but also the possibility of reconciliation between differing groups in the modern world.",1240704000,6,642,4.7657657657657655
2814493,1,B000P7V6UQ,"This documentary focuses on one the very first inquisitions, the Albigensian in southern France in the 13th century.

This is simply one of the worst documentaries I have ever seen.  The dramatizations are so badly staged and so clearly anti-Christian that it becomes clear that the producers were not trying to portray history but rather project their own anti-Christian and anti-Catholic views, and were willing to lie to do it.

Their portrayal of the Albigensian teaching is incorrect and incomplete; it fails to either mention or highlight some very critical details.  They exclude, for example, the ritualistic murder of children and misrepresent what the ""endura"" is, likening it a form of euthanasia rather than ritualistic suicide by an otherwise healthy person.

They completely ignore the fact that Albigensian teachings claim that absolutely everything in the material world is inherently evil leading followers to, among other things, reject all marriage, women, and governmental authority.  This misogynistic creed created tremendous civil unrest in southern France.  The documentary also ignores the fact that since the Albigensians considered their own material body as evil, but their immaterial souls as good, dying was a distinct improvement.  Thus murdering an enemy actually set them free.  And dying yourself was a real benefit.  You can only imagine the bloodshed that resulted.  And all that happened before local officials begged the Church to call an inquisition.

But if you watch this ""show"", you will not know any of that.  Instead, you will see an evil empire, headquartered in Rome, inexplicably grabbing farmers and shopkeepers to burn them at the stake for sport.  That is not what happened, but that is what the producers want you to think.

By failing to put this inquisition in the proper social, religious and political context, they misrepresent history and falsely malign and slander those who were trying to stop murder, revolution and anarchy by the Albigensians.

On the other hand, if you hate the Christianity or the Catholic Church, and do not mind lying to make your point, you will enjoy this work of fiction.",1206921600,25,2156,5.24198250728863
2814494,5,B000P7V6UQ,"One of the great ironies of history is that the funding of Columbus' discovery of the New World which became the bulwark of religious freedom may have come from the confiscated property of the Jews by Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand during the Spanish Inquisition. This DVD assembles information from many sources to tell the story of the Inquisition from before its inception by Pope Gregory IX in 1231 to after its dissolution by Pope Pius IX in 1862. The Inquisition which was created to control Christian heresies and blasphemies within the expanding Roman Catholic realm evolved into a program to satisfy the economic needs of Kings and Queens.

There are too few heroes in this story. Looking back from our modern perspective, this history will please only the critics of the Catholic Church and by extension all organized religions. By engaging this excellent DVD you will better appreciate how far the human mind can stretch truth and belief to satisfy political and economic needs.",1198195200,26,992,5.012121212121212
