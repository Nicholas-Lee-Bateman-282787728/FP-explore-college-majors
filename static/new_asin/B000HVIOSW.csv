8141536,5,B000HVIOSW,"Not many people have heard about DRAGON BOOSTER in the USA unless you watch episodes on TOON DISNEY! Honestly, this is the first anime/cartoon show that i've really enjoyed! It has its own lore, great storylines, and great animation (of course). The characters are quite humorous yet are easy to relate to or easily disliked. Great lessons are learned in episodes as well. I wish there were more dvds of this show because i became addicted after watching the first opening episodes from Season 1. I recommend buying this if you are interested in dragons, futuristic racing and citylife, heroes, and great animation! If you don't feel like spending money on this dvd yet, watch episodes on TOON DISNEY (in America at least that's the channel it's on that i know of). I guarantee you'll enjoy something about the show and want to buy the dvd. ^_^",1187481600,7,844,4.7482993197278915
