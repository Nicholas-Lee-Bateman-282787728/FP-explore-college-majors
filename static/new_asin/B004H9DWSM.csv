8429386,4,B004H9DWSM,"Haruko Kano (Riisa Naka), a Shibuya sales girl with a fondness for flamboyant outfits, took a temporary teaching job at a private school. Soon, she found herself learning a whole lot more about her own language and culture as she fumbled her way through the lessons. Her students, a group of gaikokujins (foreigners), had a tendency to commit faux pas and got themselves into trouble, offering the series a lot of comedy, drama, and charm.

Each episode includes some esoteric knowledge about the Japanese language and culture. For example, in episode 8, as Haruko tried to help her American salaryman student Jack repair his damaged relationship with the head of a Japanese Saki brewery, she had to learn to speak a highly regulated and respectful form of Japanese, called Keigo.

In episode 4, Haruko tried to help her young Italian student Luca with his love confession (known as kokuhaku in Japanese) to his crush Miki, a waitress in a Maid Cafe who tried to hide her regional accent. In the ensuing fiasco, Haruko and her students discovered how regional dialects evolved into what is known today as ""common Japanese.""

Some actors playing the international students give good, convincing acting consistent with their characters (most notably, Blake Crawford as the American student and salaryman Jack, Zoe as the beautiful but gullible Chinese student Jinrei, and Mayo as Black American student Bob). But others like Sebastiano Serafini as the Italian student Luca often overact.

Though the series is mainly about teaching, there are genuinely touching, poignant moments. They occur when Haruko discovered the love for her job and her native language, took on a parental and mentor-like role she was ill-prepared for, and forged a strong bond with each student.

The series is a great treasure, not just for the entertainment value but also for the linguistic and cultural knowledge it shares. However, some particularly bad English subtitles in the later episodes (especially episodes 10, 11, and 12) undermine the quality of the whole series. (One can't help but wonder if the earlier subtitle writer quit and another unqualified person was ushered into finish the job.)",1495152000,,2179,5.1440677966101696

But when I received and watched the episodes I realized that this was actually an educational movie about Japanese Language. It was very entertaining and helped me understand better the subtleties of the Japanese Language, as well as its history.

The DVDs I got play with no issues. Very good indeed.",1386720000,,367,4.5606060606060606
