Yes there are minor edits (wwf symbol and muting of the letter F in wwf, I also heard of some rare theme music changes but have yet to see it).  Overall once you start watching the action you don't even notice theses things.  Or at least I don't.

I love every thing about this box set except one thing.  The box it's in.  It is basically held closed by a sticker, but if you are like me and very careful it will be ok.  Still would this really be a non buying point for a wwe fan? Didn't think so.

You get 20 dvds of every Rumble from 1988-2007.

2691388,3,B000KHX71W,"Royal Rumble 2003

Big Show Vs. Brock Lesner - Better IMO than their SSeries encounter. This whole Rumble event was built around Lesnar as the winner of the winner match would get the final entry. Guess who won lol.

The Dudleyz Vs. Lance Storm/William Regal (World Tag Team Title Match) - This was good. But it was with 4 men I could never get into. Still, I enjoyed this.

Torrie Wilson Vs. Dawn Marie

Triple H w/Ric Flair Vs. Scott Steiner (World Heavyweight Championship Match)

Chris Benoit Vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Title Match) - a CLASSIC materpiece! Then again, every time these two met, it was a masterpiece. Benoit got a well deserved ovation after the match.

The Rumble match was one of my favorites. Some great moments: Christian coming out using Jericho's entrance, Christian trying to get Edge to join him only to get a Spear, Edge & Rey getting it on, Nowinski thinking he eliminated Edge & Rey at the same time only to get a dropkick & leg drop from them at the same time, Jericho's & Brock's runs, Kane outsmarting RVD who didn't seem to care lol, Taker's return which included eliminating Maven who tired to do what he did in 2002, tricking Kane & interaction during & after the match with Brock.

Royal Rumble 2004

The Dudleyz Vs. Ric Flair/Batista (World Tag Team Title Match) - Did not like it.

Rey Mysterio Vs. Jamie Noble w/Nidia (Cruiserweight Title Match) - Good match. It's with crusierweights so what else is there to expect, but action?

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Chavo Guerrero w/Chavo,Sr. - I was looking forward to this but was surprised by the match that happened considering how well they work & know each other. Disappointing.

Brock Lesner Vs. Hardcore Holly (WWE Title Match) - This was the weakest on the card & it was a World Title match. Same thing as Steiner/HHH. At least this was shorter than that.

Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title Match/Last Man Standing) - Wow! That's all I can say. I thought their SSlam 02 & 2 Out of 3 Falls at Armageddon 02 were their greatest. And it was along with this despite the ending.

The Rumble match was pretty much as DP said, ""The Chris Benoit Show"" & fittingly so IMO.

Royal Rumble 2005

Shawn Michaels Vs. Edge - Great opener, something that seems to be consistent (well most of the time) at the Rumble ppvs.

The Undertaker Vs. Heidenreich - Taker deserved way much better. All I can say.

The Big Show Vs. Kurt Angle Vs. JBL (WWE Title Match/Triple Threat Rules) - Better than I thought it'd be. Had Angle not been here, I don't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did.

Randy Orton Vs. HHH (World Heavyweight Title Match) - Not bad. But they'd have better bouts later in their careers.

Pretty good Rumble match. I remember Angle getting superkicked out of it by HBK, who cost HBK to be eliminated which set up their tremendous feud. Another great moment: London selling the clothesline that eliminated him. WWE dropped the ball with London & Kendrick.

Royal Rumble 2006

I can't even review this. It was that bad. I'll just give some moments:

1. Rey's Rumble match performance (too bad his win happened AFTER Eddie's passing)

2. Tatanka & Taker's returns

Those are the only things I liked.

Royal Rumble 2007

The Hardyz Vs. MNM - Must be watched. It's a great tag match.

Bobby Lashley Vs. Test (ECW Title Match) - I like Test. But this was not his best. In fact, it's one his worst. As for Lashley, never liked him.

Mr. Kennedy Vs. Batista (World Heavyweight Title Match) - Good match. Here, the challenger carried the Champion. IMO, Batista did not reach his full potential till the feud with Taker which thankfully for Batista lasted the rest of the year.

John Cena Vs. Umaga (WWE Title/Last Man Standing) - One of Cena's best.

The Rumble match wasn't bad. Slow to begin with though so you might wanna fast forward to these moments: Kane chokeslamming Sabu through the table to eliminate him, HBK's run, Taker fighting with both members of Rated RKO & the entire time the final 2 men were left. And I'm talkin about UT/HBK.",1310256000,,4027,4.5760111576011155

2691393,4,B000KHX71W,"This Royal Rumble Set is a tough one to call. Two of the Rumbles from this set are basically saved only by one match from it's card. The other three Rumbles are very good.

Now I'll be honest, I did not purchase this Royal Rumble set. I have all of these Royal Rumble PPV's either taped on VHS, on DVD, or have seen live on PPV. So with that siad, I do not know what has been blurred or edited out or what music has been altered.

2003 - This is the first of the two Rumbles that is basically saved thanks to one match. That match was the classic WWE Championship Match between WWE Champion Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit. Many regards it as one of the greatest WWE Championship matches in history. The Royal Rumble Match was won by Brock Lesnar as earlier in the night defeated the Big Show to enter the Royal Rumble Match. Highlights in the Rumble Match includes Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho beginning their three month feud leading up to Wrestlemania XIX, Chris Jericho having the best showing in the Rumble Match, and the return of the Undertaker. Other matches from this card are World Heavyweight Champion Triple H vs. Scott Steiner, Dawn Marie vs. Torrie Wilson, & The Dudley Boyz vs. William Regal & Lance Storm for the World Tag Team Championship.

2004 - This Royal Rumble event hosted from Philadelphia where we see for the only second time in history Chris Benoit winning the Royal Rumble Match from entering at No. 1. Highlights in the Rumble match includes Randy Orton making his Royal Rumble debut and having the best showing behind Chris Benoit at the age of only 23 at the time, signs of the Undertaker returning to his ""Deadman"" gimmick, Mick Foley being a surprise entrant, and Goldberg participating in his first and only Royal Rumble Match only to be eliminated by Brock Lesnar. The card also hosts a brutal Last Man Standing Match as Triple H defends his World Heavyweight Championship against Shawn Michaels. Other bouts includes WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Hardcore Holly, Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero, World Tag Team Champions Ric Flair & Batista vs. The Dudley Boyz in a Tables Match, and Rey Mysterio vs. Jamie Noble for the Cruiserweight Championship.

2005 - The Royal Rumble Match this year for the first time since 1994's Royal Rumble Match ended in controversary in almost having a dual champion in Batista and John Cena. Once Vince McMahon came out (while injuring himself in the process) and restarted the Rumble, it was Batista who came out victorious. Also the Rumble Match consists of the interaction between Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels that led to their match at Wrestlemania 21 and also Ric Flair participating in his first Royal Rumble Match since 1993. This Royal Rumble event also hosts a great World Title Match between the World Heavyweight Champion Triple H and Randy Orton. A very good Triple Threat as JBL defends his WWE Championship against the Big Show and Kurt Angle. Other bouts includes a fantastic opening bout between Shawn Michaels and Edge and also a Casket Match as the Undertaker vs. Heidenrich with cameo appearences from Kane and Snitsky.

2006 - This is the second Royal Rumble event of this set that was basically only saved because of one match. Even though it isn't as good as Angle/Benoit from 2003, but the WWE Championship Match between John Cena and Edge was the match of the night. This year's Royal Rumble Match was won by Rey Mysterio after being the second entrant and also setting the record for being the longest entrant lasting one hour and two minutes in the Rumble Match. Triple H follows Mysterio in having the second best showing after entering at No. 1 and lasting all the way to the final three. Shawn Michaels' feud with Mr. McMahon continues here at this Royal Rumble that led to their No Holds Barred Match to take place at Wrestlemania 22. Other bouts includes World Heavyweight Champion Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry with the return of The Undertaker, JBL vs. The Boogeyman, Mickie James vs. Ashley with Trish the Special Guest Referee, and also Gregory Helms winning the Cruiserweight Open for the Cruiserweight Championship.

2007 - Argubably the best Royal Rumble card from this set. This Royal Rumble was top notch from top to bottom with only one flaw. The Undertaker won his first ever Royal Rumble Match in his career here after entering at number 30 and having a great match with Shawn Michaels being the final two in the Rumble Match. Other standouts in the Royal Rumble Match was the team of Rated RKO consisting of Randy Orton and Edge. The undercard holds a great Last Man Standing Match as the WWE Champion John Cena battles Umaga, World Heavyweight Champion Batista vs. Mr. Kennedy, and The Hardys vs. MNM. The only flaw from this Rumble event was the ECW bout as the ECW Champion Bobby Lashley took on Test.

This Royal Rumble set I recommend getting. The three Royal Rumbles Match that worth seeing here are 2004, 2005, and 2007. 2003 and 2006 are watchable but doesn't come close to the other three Rumbles.",1242259200,,5017,4.7007963594994315

match 1. the hardy's vs MNM
This was a good opener. Both these team's meshed well together. It's great to see the hardy's back together and I think MNM is very underrated. The ending is good and this match is a good way to start off the PPV. 3/5

match 2. Test vs Bobby lashley(c) ECW title
First off why is test in a world title match? He's a horrible superstar and is terrible in the ring. Bobby lashley is awesome but even he could not save this match. most of the match is Test dominating lashley which is wrong, and then the ending sucked something awful. skip this match. 1/5

match 3. mr. kennedy vs batista(c) World heavyweight title
this was a very good title match. Mr kennedy is a great heel and batista is just sweet. this match had a good balance and is very watchable. The ending is a little predictable but doesn't take away from the match. Both superstars were at the top of their game. 4/5

match 4. Last man standing match, umaga vs john cena(c) WWe title
This match was sick. umaga dominated most of the match and cena sold it well. cena got busted open and he bleed all over the place. alot of sick moves and the ring even came apart! the ending was cool and original and this match was sweet. 4.5/5

match 5. Royal Rumble match
the hype of the match was the most star studded rumble ever. I don't think it was but it was an awesome match. Sabu was sent through a table and Khali dominated. Finlay was very impressive and so was edge. The final two superstars put on a great show to finish off the match. It also great to see a former champion and legend win because the theme for the last four years was up an coming superstar win(brock lesnar, benoit, batista, rey mysterio) they won before they were superstars. Must see match.

WWE Royal Rumble 2008
The Royal Rumble was not the best way to start the year, but it did have its high points. This is the 20th anniversary of the Royal Rumble. If you are looking for a good Royal Rumble event, this is not the one to choose. The extras are a match and segment from the following Raw. The only other extra is a extremely short interview with Undertaker after the Royal Rumble.

Hardy Boyz VS MNM
I am sure this is a dream match in everyone's mind. This match is not the dream match we all expected though. We get a standard tag match with some good match and worth action. MNM controls most of the match. This is your customary opener.
RATING- 7.5/10

ECW Championship
Bobby Lashley(c) VS Test
Lashley was never much of a champion. This match enforces that. The match goes back and forth for a few minutes. The match is not too bad, but the ending lowers this match down in its rating.
RATING- 5/10

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista(c) VS Mr. Kennedy
Batista/Kennedy is a much better title bout than the pervious one. Batista has his leg rammed into the steel steps. Kennedy focuses on the leg of Batista for the rest of the match. The winner is predictable though, and that hurts the match.
RATING- 7/10

Last Man Standing Match
WWE Championship
John Cena(c) VS Umaga w/ Armando Estrada
Despite many putting this match on a pedestal, I did not find the match to be too amazing. Sure, it was a fun match with some good spots, but it does not compare to other Last Man Standing Matches. Cena tosses steel steps into Umaga's face in one sick spot. The ending is probably the most unique I have seen of any match.
RATING- 8.5/10

Royal Rumble Match (Match of the DVD)
The Royal Rumble match is one of my favorite match types. The 20th anniversary is not a let down. There are a few good spots here and there. Most of the match is very mellow though and not much action takes place. Khali eliminates seven men in this match. The final two men in the match put on a classic showing.

2691397,4,B000KHX71W,"I was looking forward to three out of the four matches on this card. Usually the Royal Rumble's feature a great Championship Main Event. Plus with this rumble there looks to be a couple of solid matches plus the rumble match itself.

Tag Team Grudge Match:

The Hardy Boyz vs. Mercury and Nitro

Great Tag Team Match to open up the rumble, very quick paced explosive tag team match. Both Teams shined as the match was given plenty of time to be good. Match Length: 15 minutes

Winners: The Hardy Boyz(3.5 out of 5 stars)

ECW Championship:

Bobby Lashley(c) vs. Test

This was horrible, probably the worst world championship match of the year. I didn't expect a classic,but I figured power vs. power match to be showcased which would make a decent match. It just did not happen which ruined things. They should have had Rob Van Dam face Lashley it would have been a much better match. Match Length: 7 minutes

Winner: Bobby Lashley by countout(1 out of 5 stars)

World Championship:

Batista(c) vs. Mr. Kennedy

A good match and alot better than the ECW Championship joke of a match. It was good but could have been better, Batista matches are only good when someone can carry him to a good match. Kennedy tried to do that but could not pull it out. Match Length: 10 minutes

Winner: Batista(3 out of 5 stars)

Last Man Standing for the WWE Championship:

John Cena(c) vs. Umaga

Great match between these two as they are both brawlers and they mix well together. Some people may not like it but I thought it was a very good contest it was given 20 plus minutes to make the Last Man Standing rule realistic. Cena chocked out Umaga with the ring ropes making the finish believeable as well as maintaining Umaga's monster gimmick. Match Length:23 minutes

Royal Rumble Match:

Great Royal Rumble Match several men made great impacts. The Undertaker wins his first Royal Rumble, to go onto bigger and better things. Shawn Michaels is solid as always in his hometown as he and Taker were the final two and a great classic showdown between the both of them. There were some others who had great impacts or performances... Shelton Benjamin, Finlay, Edge, and surprisingly the Great Khali added something to this years edition to the Royal Rumble Match.

Overall Thoughts: I was impressed with the Royal Rumble the 3 matches that I was looking forward to seeing all were good and met my expectations. Glad to see the Undertaker win the Royal Rumble and go to Wrestlemania.",1219536000,,2465,4.653579676674365
2691398,5,B000KHX71W,What do you expect from the uniquest paper-view ever created.  There is the royal rumble from 2004 to the past royal rumble which was 2008's.  I mean if your new to this stuff get the first one but if you know all about get the whole set because it is entertaining baby!!!!,1217376000,,273,4.230769230769231
2691399,4,B000KHX71W,"Royal Rumble 2007 was the 20th edition and it returned to San Antonio after 10 years. The ppv was just great overall with one bad match but it's watchable. It had a surperb opening and a historic ending.

1. The Hardy Boyz vs. MNM
This was just a solid good opener. These two teams really mesh well with each other and it was just a good old fashion 2 on 2 tag match with hardly no interference from Melina. There were some good classic Hardy offense and good wrestling from MNM. Solid opener. 4/5

2. Ecw World Championship
Test vs. Bobby Lashley
Just your standard powerhouse, big man match up. It got pretty good in the beginning but then it just went down hill very early. It even got worse when Test got counted out. Some impact moves but really nothing good. 2/5

3. World Heavyweight Championship
Batista vs. Mr. Kennedy
I was really impressed with this match when I watched it. Kennedy didn't really brought out the best in Batista but I think Kennedy made this match. Some good moneuvers executed as well. Kennedy utilizes like a backwards inverted figure 4 leg lock on Batista which was interesting to see. You even hear some KENNEDY chants from the crowd towards the end of the match. Pretty good match. 4/5

4. Last Man Standing Match for the WWE Championship
John Cena vs. Umaga
I can see Umaga being a champion one day. I believe he will resemble like a Yokozuna if he becomes champion but this wasn't his night to become the champ. The match was very brutal. Some very hard head shots to Umaga with the tv monitor and the steel steps. Cena bled a lot in this one. A good table spot as well. And I felt the ending was appropriate and it fitted in well. Good title match. 4.5/5

5. The Royal Rumble Match
To me, this was the best Royal Rumble Match since the 2004 Rumble. It had some good names to partake in it but I don't feel it was the ""Most Star Studded"" Rumble of all time but it was good nevertheless.

It started out with a good fight between Flair and Finlay but I hated it when Flair became the first one eliminated. Kane would enter and chokslam Sabu through a table, so that was one of the good spots in the rumble. The crowd really got pumped when their hometown boy ""toy"" entered the Rumble. The final four put on a good showing and a even better showing from the final two. They put on one of the best last final 2 left standing fight in Rumble history to this day. Great Rumble. 5/5

Very good rumble. I recommend picking this one up.
*Note*- This was the Undertaker's third time entering the Royal Rumble as number 30 and it was the first time that the number 30 entrant would win the Rumble so I guess the third time is a charm.",1215648000,,2659,4.316633266533066
2691400,4,B000KHX71W,"Yeah.  It was.  Even John Cena, whom I usually hate with a strong passion, managed to at least look threatened against Umaga, who put on the show of his life.

MNM vs The Hardy Boys
I thought December to Dismember was the ""one night only"" match between these two teams.  Honestly, I think it should have ended there---it was the only good match of that sabotaged event.  Instead, it's regurgitated again as a filler match.  Nothing unique or special happened here at all.  It was basic generic tag team action, with none of the style or special skills that make MNM and the Hardys so unique.  No high-flying, no high-impact, no high spots, no technical prowess.  Just generic tag team action.  (3/10)

""ECW"" Championship
Bobby Lashley (C) vs Test
Lashley wins.  (2/10)

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista (C) vs Kennedy Kennedy
This looks like the sort of match that would be chucked onto an average episode of Smackdown with no hype whatsoever, and be a quick squash by the champion against a midcarder with no chance in hell of winning.  And yet it would almost seem like Kennedy said screw the booking, and broke out to put on a great showing against the immovable lump Batista.  Kennedy showed me he could potentially be a contender.  And then Batista went ""HULK SMASH!"" and squashed Kennedy like Triple H squashes so many midcarders.  (6/10)

WWE Championship
John Cena (C) vs Umaga
Another situation like the previous match, where it could be chucked onto a random episode of RAW with no hype whatsoever.  And yet Umaga put on the match of his career.  Clearly Umaga did most, if not all, of the carrying in this match, while Cena just reacted as far as his limited skills allow him.  I knew for a fact Cena wouldn't job to anyone at this point, but for god's sake, Umaga just showed how great a competitor he is in this one matchup.  Phenomenal break-out action by Umaga, tragically put down by RAW's immovable lump.  (7/10)

Royal Rumble Match
Vastly superior to last year's match, which happened in the MIDDLE of the show, and featured all the most basic and generic cliche's of the rumble match.  This one was back to status quo (a good thing, this time) and had legitimately entertaining moments, and lots of eye-widening spots, and a great way to justify Undertaker's victory despite coming in at number 30.  (10/10)

So it was good.  Not at all a great event in any stretch of the imagination.  But the main event, the Royal Rumble, was something watchable for a long time.",1213920000,,2490,4.6728110599078345
2691401,5,B000KHX71W,"I unfortunately missed out watching this Rumble live as we had something wrong with our TV. I caught it on DVD a couple of months later and was very  impressed. (Also the picture for the DVD front is of the 06 Rumble not the 07 Rumble xD)

The Rumble is the main reason why my mother and I purchased the DVD but there's a couple of matches on the undercard that were well worth the money too. But there was also a couple of really bad matches.

Rundown, shall we?

MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro & Melina) vs the Hardy Boys (Jeff Hardy & Matt Hardy)
A great way to begin the PPV and one of the stronger matches on the undercard. I wasn't a huge MNM fan but they showed their skills - and of course the Hardys were as great as ever. Lots of high flying moves and great tag team work, with the Hardys picking up the win. (4.5/5)

ECW Championship (Bobby Lashley vs Test)
*snore* This match was boring. I liked Bobby, but even he couldn't make this match decent. Test is horrible and the fact that he bailed on a championship match at a PPV is just sucky. I'm glad that Bobby beat him up afterwards. (2/5)

World Heavyweight Championship (Batista vs Mr Kennedy)
At this point in time, I didn't think Kennedy was up to WHC standard. This match was just average and nothing special happened. Batista picked up the win. (3/5)

WWE Championship Last Man Standing match (John Cena vs Umaga)
This was without a doubt, the best match on the undercard. John showed how good he is in hardcore matches and put on a good showing against the Samoan Bulldozer. There were loads of sick spots and a spectacular ending with John choking Umaga out with the ring ropes. A very good match, one of John's best of 2007. (5/5)

Royal Rumble match
This was one of the best Rumbles I've seen to date. It was constant non stop action from start to finish, with loads of great moments and spots. Shawn Michaels got a huge reaction from the crowd as the event was held in his hometown of San Antonio and I honestly thought he would win. But he and the Undertaker put on a tremendous end to the match, that lasted almost ten minutes and was possibly one of the most exciting finishes to a Rumble ever. The Rumble featured loads of great superstars, some great moments and a great ending, although I wanted Shawn to win, I was happy with Taker winning. Brilliant. (5/5)

The extras are also good - my favourite is the the World Tag Team Title match were John Cena & Shawn Michaels (my two favourite superstars) take the titles from Randy Orton & Edge. The whole match is entertaining and fast paced.

This Rumble is definitely recommended - mainly for the Rumble itself, John vs Umaga, the tag team match on the extras and to a lesser extent MNM vs Hardys. If you overlook the ECW & World Heavyweight matches, this is definitely a strong PPV. 5 stars.",1210550400,,2821,4.376673040152964
2691402,4,B000KHX71W,"Hardys VS MNM: A good opener but nothing really speical. A typical match for both teams.

Bobby Lashley VS Test: Test is too much like Scott Steiner back in the dying days of WCW. Come to think of it, the WCW title didn't mean anything back then and the ECW title doesnt mean anything now either, so Test should have held the title. Lashley should have never been world champion. This match is a typical big man vs big man match for a company that doesnt exist anymore. Good thing both these wrestlers are gone from WWE.

Batista VS Ken Kennedy: I use to love Kennedy when he cut promos and yell his name out, he rarely does that anymore. Kennedy was about ready to have the world handed to him, then he got busted for steroids. Now he is just anther face on Raw. A decent match but nothing to get excited over.

John Cena VS Umaga: Love him or hate him, John Cena can wrestle an awesome hardcore match. This is one of the best matches of 2007. Cena puts on a hell of a show and so does Umaga. Highly recommend watching this match if you like hardcore wrestling.

Royal Rumble: Alot of people loved this match. I didn't think it was great expect for when it was down to 'Taker and HBK. A typical Rumble with a great ending. It did make me miss Sandman though. He was such a great talent and was never used right. I miss that guy.

Overall, a decent card. Royal Rumble has not been that great over the last few years. The only saving grace for the recent Rumble's have been awesome title matches. Cena-Umaga is well worth the price.",1205020800,,1531,4.26551724137931
2691403,4,B000KHX71W,Saw enogh action to say that this product is well worth getting to have in a collection.  I you get one dvd I recomend that this is one that you get now.,1204070400,,153,3.78125
2691404,5,B000KHX71W,"This collection takes a look at The Royal Rumble cards from 2003 thru 2007. And, for those that wonder, the footage of the now infamous Chris Benoit is intact. Now, lets get to the cards:

Royal Rumble 2003

Big Show Vs. Brock Lesner - A rematch from their Survivor Series 2002 match with the winner getting a slot in The Royal Rumble match later in the card. Not a bad match to start off with.

The Dudleyz Vs. Lance Storm/William Regal (World Tag Team Title Match) - A good tag team bout which saw Regal and Storm's dirty tricks backfire as The Dudleyz collect another tag team title.

Torrie Wilson Vs. Dawn Marie - The second weakest bout on the card. Thankfully, it was kept short.

Triple H w/Ric Flair Vs. Scott Steiner (World Heavyweight Championship Match) - This has to be one of the worst world title bouts ever! I'd stop short of calling it THE worst but its up there! While HHH is a good performer, he has to be in there with someone that compliments his style and Steiner wasn't that guy! It really stunk up the joint!

Chris Benoit Vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Title Match) - This, along with the Rumble itself, saves this card! Despite his twisted and evil actions, no one can take away the fact that Chris Benoit (along with Kurt) gave us one of the best WWE title matches ever. No, I am not forgetting what he did to his family but if this is going to be a true anthology, then I am glad WWE had the stones to keep this match on here. History of any kind shouldn't ever be censored to please people. If that were the case then 9/11 would be forgotten and I am sure if someone suggested that, there would be an outrage.

Back to the match, it was a classic and for those that think it should've been deleted, I say learn to use your DVD menu or your fast forward button! End of story.

The Rumble match itself was pretty good. Pretty well balanced as far as surprises and performances.

Royal Rumble 2004

The Dudleyz Vs. Ric Flair/Batista (World Tag Team Title Match) - This was contested under ""tables"" rules. The Dudleyz was unable to repeat what they did the previous year against the Evolution duo. Okay match but it seemed a bit rushed.

Rey Mysterio Vs. Jamie Noble w/Nidia (Cruiserweight Title Match) - Lots of action but something seemed dead about this bout. Ends when Nidia's attempt to help Jamie backfires and gives Mysterio the win.

Eddie Guerrero Vs. Chavo Guerrero w/Chavo,Sr. - Okay bout. These two had better matches against each other in the old WCW but this was okay. The real action takes place after the bout as Eddie gives his nephew Chavo and brother Chavo, Sr. a savage beating!

Brock Lesner Vs. Hardcore Holly (WWE Title Match) - Weakest match on the card. Not close to the level of Benoit Vs. Angle but no where near the stinker that Steiner Vs. HHH was the previous year! It had some decent spots but thankfully, it was kept short.

Triple H Vs. Shawn Michaels (World Heavyweight Title Match/Last Man Standing) - Now this was much better than the previous years' World Title match! Despite the draw ending, its worth your 20 minutes to watch.

The Rumble match might as well have been called (as DP said) ""The Chris Benoit Show"" because it was pretty much his show en route to him winning and setting a record. Other notable performances were Randy Orton, The Big Show and the spot when Benoit, John Cena, Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle pretty much put their finishers on The Big Show at one point or another!

Royal Rumble 2005

Shawn Michaels Vs. Edge - This was Edge first serious push in a long time towards single stardom as he took on ""HBK"" in an exciting opener.

The Undertaker Vs. Heidenreich - This was a casket match and was the weakest match on the card. It has its moments however, especially when Snitsky and Kane get involved near the end.

The Big Show Vs. Kurt Angle Vs. JBL (WWE Title Match/Triple Threat Rules) - Surprisingly good. These three have decent chemistry together. Was never impressed with JBL's ring ability but I will give him this, he does have a good character and gets a lot of heat during this match. Ends when JBL gets a cover on Kurt with the help of his ""cabinet.""

Randy Orton Vs. HHH (World Heavyweight Title Match) - Okay bout but these two have had better against each other. Don't know if it was legit or just acting but Randy Orton does suffer a concussion after a botched DDT attempt on HHH. The match is over after that.

The Rumble match here was pretty good. Highlights is the showdown between John Cena and Batista at the end as well as a ""chop-fest"" at the beginning that saw Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly take then-rookie Daniel Puter to the proverbial ""woodshed"" after Puter makes some cocky comments. Also, it was the beginning of the classic series between Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle that dominated much of 2005 and one spot that saw superstars from both RAW and Smackdown put aside their differences to beat up Iraqi sympathizer Assad in a short but hilarious moment!

Royal Rumble 2006

I'll go ahead and just say it. Watch this one only for John Cena Vs. Edge as it was the best match on the card! Yes, it is one of the rare times I actually give Cena credit! All the other matches (including the Rumble match itself) ranged from okay (Cruiserweight bout) to terrible (Kurt Angle Vs. Mark Henry).

Even The Rumble match wasn't that special this time around in 2006. As much as I love Rey Mysterio, there is no way in hell he should've won The Royal Rumble! While he does have the stamina, there is no way he would survive HHH, let alone Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, Shawn Michaels, The Big Show, Kane and all the other stars that entered that match! One of those heavyweights would've eventually caught him and tossed his a** over the top rope!

Don't get me wrong, I understand what they were trying to do and that was make a feel good moment in memory of Eddie Guerrero (who had died 2 months prior) but they could've picked someone else that had a close connection to Eddie like Chavo or Benoit (don't scoff at that because it was January 2006, long before the tragic events of June 2007) or even Matt Hardy. Anyway, it had its moments but overall, not a great Rumble match.

Royal Rumble 2007

The Hardyz Vs. MNM - Great tag team match to begin the card. It has to be watched.

Bobby Lashley Vs. Test (ECW Title Match) - Weakest bout on the card. It was more worthy of ECW on Sci-Fi than a PPV.

Mr. Kennedy Vs. Batista (World Heavyweight Title Match) - These two had a good bout. Most of which was carried by Kennedy. Ends with Batista winning after having his leg worked over by Kennedy for several minutes.

John Cena Vs. Umaga (WWE Title/Last Man Standing) - If you want wrestling, then you won't find it here! This was just a straight brawl and, to be honest, one of Cena's better bouts! I loved when he used the ring ropes to choke out Umaga in the STFU. As I said, one of his best and believable bouts.

The Royal Rumble match was very good overall. The last 10 minutes with Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels is worth just forwarding to that part alone! It was their first face off since The Royal Rumble 1998 in that casket match that put Shawn on the shelf until 2002.

Overall, this is a good collection to get just for the nostalgic value. Worth your $30 bucks or so.",1202169600,7,7291,4.438202247191011
2691405,5,B000KHX71W,"This was the 20th annual WWE Royal Rumble PPV event, and WWE really outdid themselves. IT has a very decnt undercard, but the Rumble is whats so amazing about this PPV. This is one of the best PPVs since One Night Stand 2006 and it really ranks high up there. The lower-card wasn't the best it ever has been, but it was better than 2006, 2003, and 2002 for sure.

Hardy Boyz Vs. MNM
This was a good way to end a great ag team feud. This match wasn't as good as their December to Dismember match, but was still a great tag team match. What makes it even better was the fact that it wasn't for titles, but it was an actual tag team feud. The crowd could've made this match better however. 8/10

ECW Championship match: Bobby Lashley Vs. Test
This match was pretty terrible. Why wasn't it an extreme rules match? It's for the freaking ECW title! Anyways. I've always thought Test was a very great wrestler, and I know bobby Lashley is a great athlete, but this match was just terrible. These 2 do NOT work well together at all. Thank God it was short. 4/10

World Heavyweight Championship: Batista Vs. Mr. Kennedy
Batista was once a great wrestler, but that was back in 2005. This guy is still somehow going off his WM21 momentum, which is not only stale but is just not great at all. He hasn't been a good wrestler since the injury, and is stale and boring to watch. Kennedy, however, I beleive is the future of this business, and really knows how to put on a great match, but even Kennedy can't make Batista look good. It was good because of Kennedy, it wasn't great because of Batista. 7/10

Last Man Standing for the WWE title: John Cena Vs. Umaga
How much longer is this guy seriously gonna hold the strap? I mean come on! It's been the better part of going on 3 years! He is stale, and really needs to go back to being heel. This was a very great match however. Umaga is a machine, and Cena can put on good PPV matches. This was a brutal match, but it could have been way better if it had more weapon usage, and if Umaga bled and sold the choke better. 9/10

Royal Rumble Match
This will go down as my favorite Royal Rumble match, and I know exactly where i'm coming from. I've been watching Royal Rumbles since 1995, and I've even seen 1992, but this way outshines ever Royal Rumble to date. It takes the best of old school, ECW, WWE, and even WCW and throws it in making it the most star studded Rumble ever. Very great way to do the 20th annual Royal Rumble. And what made it even better was the fact that there was no run-in half time show (Kat Miller, Honkey Tonk Man) and no stupid celebrity appearance (Drew Carry) but just pure WWE superstars putting on the best Rumble ever.

Some highlights were 6 former world champions in the ring at once, Finlay going 30 minutes, Edge going 45 minutes and being in the final 4, Big Vis elimination. I only Wish RVD would have lasted longer. I was pulling for Edge or RVD to win, but Taker coming in at number 30, and then having an epic 8 minute brawl with HBK as the final 2 was just as good with me. 10/10

I strongly recomend this DVD simply for the rumble match, and the LMS match is a very great addition. I just wish the extras included a video of the previous rumbles, or something about it being the 20th rumble.

Extras include:
Rated RKO Vs. Cena/HBK from Raw the next night (8/10 match)
Vince and Donald Trump

I also hope The previous In Your Houses, King of The Rings, SummerSlams, and Survivor Series also come to DVD in a collectors set. This item is a must have for any wrestling fan from Hogan winning back to back Rumbles in the early 90's to HBK winning back to back Rubles in 95 and 96 to Stone Cold winning 3 straight Rumbles following. My favorite Rumble was probably either 1995 or 1997. The Razor Ramon Intercontinental Title matches 1994-1996 were awesome. The only negative would be the wrapping of this product as someone commented on earlier. I watched opened it twice and the yellow ribbon came off the cover becasue it shouldn't have had that much weight on each side in the first place, it would have been cool but they should have made sperate cases in the box set not just dvd's fitting into a small box.

This is with out a doubt one of the best Royal Rumbles in the history of wrestling; the rumble match itself was a classic, the best actually. I was really impressed with this event. Enough of this lets get to the review.

1. MNM VS THE HARDY'S-excellent way to start off the show, two of the best teams in the business went head to head in this fast paced match. The match went back and forth for the majority of the match. This was a great way to open the show. 5/5

2. ECW CHAMPIONSHIP:BOBBY LASHELY VS TEST-this was a decent match up, the thing is that these two had a better match on ECW on the SCI-FI Channel a week or two earlier. This match was ok though, it is not as bad as most make it out to be, I actually like both of these guys. I have always liked Test when he was in a heel role, and even though I think Lashley became a champion to early I still think he did well in this match. The match ended with a count out, and was over fairly quickly for a title bout. 3.8/5

3. WORLD TITLE:BATISTA VS KEN KENNEDY-this was actually a really good match, I don't think too many people give it the credit it deserves. I do agree that Mr. Kennedy carried this match but Batista did his thing even though I' am not his biggest fan. This was a very well paced match and I dare say one of the better matches of the night, I really enjoyed this match even tough Batista held on to the belt. 4.5/5

4. WWE CHAMPIONSHIP:JOHN CENA VS UMAGA-still not sure how I feel about Umaga but I have always liked Cena, I liked him better as a bad guy though. This was a really good match and is actually what you would have though the ECW match would have been like. The ending for this match was really good, and ended up being better than I thought it would be. 5/5

5. ROYAL RUMBLE-this has got to be the greatest Royal Rumble match to ever take place, and if not the greatest it's still one of. The entire match was paced well and very entertaining, but like everyone else I really enjoyed the action when it came down to the TEXAS boys. HBK and The Undertaker gave us one of the greatest endings in the history of this event, I like how they gave each other respect at the end. CLASSIC.5/5

The 1996 Royal Rumble was probably the worst Rumble and the one with Steiner-Triple H was terriable as well.

A piece of printed paper hold together two large heavy sides. I have pampered the case like a newborn baby and it's already about to tear.  Normal wear and tear will have people buying new cases in the first month.

Beyond that....I can't wait to see all 56 hours.

2691419,4,B000KHX71W,"In his entire career before this event Undertaker had never won a royal rumble, but now he can finally join the illustrious list of rumble winners as well as one of the few who went on to Wrestlemania and win the world title. The rest of the card was stacked as well, all three titles that were on the line were retained by their own champions, including a wild brawl between Cena and Umaga...

MNM vs. The Hardy Boys:

Great way to start off the show. I am sorry to hear about Mercury being let go, because matches like these prove why tag team wrestling is the best form of wrestling ever! This match was very fast paced, back and forth action and a lot of tagging in and out. Jeff Hardy is his usual self of unpredictable high flying moves, and yes Melina is still as hot as ever! In the end the Hardy Boys win. 8/10

ECW World Heavyweight Championship

Bobby Lashley [Champion] vs. Test:

I don't know if it was because these two fought three times in two weeks, but this match was just horrible. I never liked Test and Bobby Lashley is still a little too new to be made a champion. This is the match that many people left to go to the bathroom, including me. Bobby Lashley wins, big surprise. 5/10

World Heavyweight Championship

Batista [Champion] vs. Ken Kennedy:

I am glad Kennedy won the Money in the Bank ladder match and he will be champion sometime this year, but this match was just bad too, mostly because of Batista. The crowd was actually solidly behind Kennedy in this one, and Batista just pretty much got owned by Kennedy and his submission skills. Near the end Batista does a Hulk Hogan version of ""Hulking Up"" and gets the win for the cheap ending. 7/10

WWE Championship

Last Man Standing Match

John Cena [Champion] vs. Umaga:

Sigh, once again Cena remains champ. This match was actually pretty intense, a lot of weapon use such as chairs, steel steps, even the ring ropes as they were broken in the middle of the match! One sick spot saw Cena throw the steel steps out of the ring right into Umaga's face! Umaga then had Cena on the announce table and tried to do a running splash but Cena moved and Umaga put himself through the table. In the end Cena uses the ring ropes to literally strangle Umaga and got the win. 8.5/10

Royal Rumble Match:

Very good royal rumble for the 20th annual royal rumble. A lot of top names such as Undertaker, HBK, Chris Benoit, Rob Van Dam, and others were used. Some highlights include Kane chokeslamming Sabu out of the ring right through a table in a great spot! Others include many old rivals getting to faceoff against each other and of course it came down to HBK and Undertaker. Undertaker won even though the rumble was in HBK's hometown, still a great match. 9/10

Extras include the match where Rated RKO lose the tag team titles to Cena and Michales, as well as Kane congradulating Undertaker for his impressive win, some interesting stuff. This rumble is highly recommended.",1175817600,9,2947,4.482242990654205
2691420,3,B000KHX71W,The 2007 royal rumble was overall disappointment for several reasons. Those reasons have to do with the matches which were on the card. Batista vs. kennedy was not that exciting for me. I don't understand why wwe insists on pushing kennedy so much. (trying to create the next big star perhaps?)Last man standing featuring Cena vs. umaga was ok. It had its good moments and slow points. The only good match of the night was the royal rumble itself. The final two stars remaining were taker and hbk. HBK attempted to eliminate taker with a superkick but taker countered by lifting micheals up on his shoulders and throwing him over the top rope and out of the ring. I did like that wwe decided to go back to  leaving the rumble match for last( as it should be every year). I would find a way to see only the rumble match itself and skip the undercard stuff. I cant strongly recommend buying this one. Thanks for reading. OUT,1175558400,,922,4.488095238095238

Match #3 World Heavyweight Championship

  Batista (c) vs Mr. Kennedy

  I would like to start out by saying that I like Mr. Kennedy but he did not deserve to be in this match. He's always saying that he has beaten 7 World Champions. That is bull &%$!! He is not good enough to beat a champion he could only win by a technicality. He keeps saying he won of bad calls. Mr. Kennedy and everybody else if you are reading this stop saying you are good enough to fight these guys. You have only been here for 2 years. You are not brock lesnar you do not get a title shot that fast and win. Also he should not have won beat the clock because of a cheap shot. This match was good. Mr. Kennedy tried to keep up but he is not good enough to fight batista. Winner Batista 7/10

Match #4 WWE Championship Last Man Standing

  John Cena (c) vs Umaga

  For all you cena haters out their. If you hate Cena you will LOVE him after this match. The best match that John Cena has had in years. His best match since his ""I Quit"" match against JBL. THeir is so much action and power Cena Wins after using the turnbucle rope to give Umaga an STFU until he was knocked out.

10/10

Royal Rumble Match

  Probably the best Royal Rumble match in years. Their was so much action fights and power. Their was actually a table used in the match It came down to the Undertaker and Shawn Michals. The fought by them selves for about 10 minutes. Undertaker finally won a rumble after micheals went for a SCM and Undertaker grabbed under his leg to throw him over the rope. Also Undertaker came in at number 30. The first time the number actually won. Also The Great Khali came in to eliminate almost 9 people straight. 12/10!!!!!!!!

Overall the PPV ranked a 9.5/ 10 Get this PPV I recommend it with no doubt.",1174608000,,2188,4.2227602905569
2691423,5,B000KHX71W,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS IN 2014

In what started out as a concept for a television special over the years has evolved into one the biggest events of the year that's been known as the beginning of ""The Road To WrestleMania"" with the main attraction being a match that took the concepts of a gauntlet & battle royal into what's become known as the Royal Rumble.

1988 - This was the first Rumble in WWF history as a special on USA network which long time fans remember was an attempt to take an audience away the NWA ""Bunkhouse Stampede"" PPV that same night.  This Rumble only featured 20 men before going to the traditional number of 30. The other main attraction on this card was the contract signing for the rematch between WWE Champion Hulk Hogan & Andre The Giant for ""The Main Event"" broadcast the next month with the difference this time being Ted Dibiase & Virgil being in Andre's corner.  Other matches include Ricky Steamboat vs. Rick Rude, Dino Bravo attempting a new bench press record, two sets of 2 out of 3 falls matches featuring a rare title defense of the Womens Tag Team Championship between the Jumping Bomb Angles & Glamour Girls along with Young Stallions vs. Islanders.  It should be noted that this entire event had never been released in full on either DVD or VHS prior to this anthology.

1989 - This edition of the Rumble was the first time the event became the now yearly PPV event.  The Rumble match went to the traditional format of 30 men instead of the previous 20 which featured such highlights as who drew the first two numbers, a record set that would last for 20 years, how the odds on favorite ended up eliminating himself, the interaction of the Mega Powers during the match, and the story going on all night behind Ted Dibiase's entry number.  Other matches include Ultimate Warrior vs. Rick Rude in a ""Super Posedown"" bodybuilding contest, Haku vs. Harley Race in a match to determine the ""King Of Wrestling"" with Bobby Heenan representing both men, Womens Champion Rockin' Robin vs. Judy Martin with Sensational Sherri on commentary, and a two out of three falls six man tag match with Jim Duggan & Hart Foundation vs. Fabulous Rougeaus & Dino Bravo.

1990 - This Rumble match included such highlights as the top two names & champions in the WWE at that time going face to face for the first time, Ted Dibiase's entry number & the irony of it when compared to last year, and up to five men eliminating one.  Other matches include Jim Duggan vs. Big Boss Man, Ronnie Garvin vs. Greg Valentine in a submission match, Brutus Beefcake vs. The Genius, Bushwackers vs. Fabulous Rougeaus, and The Brother Love Show with Sapphire & Sensational Queen Sherri.

1991 - This Rumble featured more new faces than the previous years but was your typical battle royal with the big highlight coming down to who were the final two as they had months long history against each other with the winner making Rumble history.  The WWE Championship was defended for the first time in Rumble history with Ultimate Warrior defending against Sgt. Slaughter who recently returned to WWE as an Iraqi sympathizer during this time the Gulf War was going on with Warrior's actions earlier in the night based off a challenged issued to him coming back to haunt him in more ways than one.  Other matches include Dusty & Dustin Rhodes vs. Ted Dibiase & Virgil with Dibiase & Virgil constantly having miscommunication against each other throughout the entire match to the point where Dibiase got a response after the match that he never got before, Big Boss Man continuing to battle The Heenan Family members one by one vs. Barbarian, Rockers vs. Orient Express, and Mountie vs. Koko B. Ware.

1992 - The winner of the Royal Rumble match became the WWE Champion for the first (and so far last) time in history leading to such highlights as a new record set for the longest time, the debut of Shawn Michaels new persona that we would later refer to as ""The Heartbreak Kid"", the confrontations between Randy Savage & Jake Roberts along with Ric Flair & Roddy Piper, the final three, and Bobby Heenan reacting the everything & everyone around Flair throughout the entire match leading to some very comedic moments on commentary.  Other matches include Roddy Piper attempting to make history by winning two championships on the same night against Intercontinental Champion The Mountie, Tag Team Champions Legion Of Doom vs. Natural Disasters, Bushwhackers vs. Beverly Brothers, and New Foundation vs. Orient Express.

1993 - It was at this Rumble where the stipulation of ""winner gets the WWE Championship title shot at WrestleMania"" was put into play that is still continued to this day that featured such highlights as the first two men which would be considered a dream match for long time WWE & NWA/WCW fans, a new record set, past & current rivalries revisited, who decided to make their first impression on Undertaker, ""every man for himself"" coming into play between former tag team championship partners, and how one man forgetting the rules of match cost him the victory.  Other matches include WWE Champion Bret Hart vs. Razor Ramon, the long awaited match between Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Marty Jannetty match with Sensational Sherri making her return for the first time since she was knocked out with the glass mirror, Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Big Boss Man, Steiner Brothers vs. Beverly Brothers, and the debut of Bobby Heenan revealing ""The Narcissist"" Lex Luger.

1994 - This Rumble featured such highlights as one man's dominance & having the most eliminations in the match to the point where the crowd got behind him, five to seven men working together on more than once occasion to eliminate one, one wrestler unable to compete, rivals either working together or against each other, and what happened to the final two that's never happened before & the crowds reaction.  WWE Champion Yokozuna defended the championship against Undertaker in not only a Casket Match but what would also be Taker's only title match against Yoko in a match that was literally Taker fighting the odds as Yokozuna showed that he had a lot of friends in high places.  Bret & Owen Hart had their issues after the previous Survivor Series PPV only to bury the hatchet & challenge WWE Tag Team Champions Quebeckers in a match that saw Bret suffer an injury that would change more than just the course of the match.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. I.R.S. that saw the appearance of another man having issues in regards to the Intercontinental Championship, and Tatanka vs. Bam Bam Bigelow.

1995 - The special guest hostess for this event was ""Baywatch"" star Pamela Anderson as she was set to escort the winner of the Royal Rumble match to the ring at the upcoming WrestleMania as the Rumble was actually the shortest Rumble in history as every participant came out after 1 minute instead of the traditional 2 minutes featuring such highlights as history being made in regards to not only what number the winner drew but how he took advantage of the rules to win the match, another superstar who went a very long distance in the match, and a wrestler looking for revenge for what happened earlier in the night.  WWE Champion Diesel defended the championship against Bret Hart in his first televised match back since Survivor Series that saw Bret use a more aggressive style that anyone has seen from him that saw both of them continue to go despite so many instances of the match getting out of control that gets overshadowed by their Survivor Series match later in the year.  Other matches include Jeff Jarrett vs. Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon, Bam Bam Bigelow teaming with Tatanka in the Tag Team Title tournament finals against 1-2-3 Kid & Bob Holly along with the confrontation with Lawerence Taylor afterwards, and Undertaker vs. I.R.S. in what began the year long story in regards to Undertaker's urn.

1996 - The Rumble this year featured various highlights including the impressive debut performance of the future Triple H, the battle of the super heavyweights...on more than one occasion, Jerry Lawler's performance...or lack there of, Jake Roberts' return, one wrestler looking for revenge for what happened earlier in the night, best friends & partners going at it, Vader getting out of control, and a Rockers' reunion.  WWF Champion Bret Hart defended his championship against Undertaker, still wearing a mask protecting his face from the eye injury months earlier, in a match where both Taker & Bearer made it clear that they would do whatever it took to win the WWE Championship even if it was unpopular & against the rules with the biggest story being what happened before the match that would have an effect later on.  Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon walked into the Rumble for the third year in a row defending his championship against Goldust with the debuting Marlena with Goldust making Razor very uncomfortable during the match with his mannerisms with this match being very controversial due to the backstage politics of how one man refused to work with the other.  Other matches include Tag Team Champions Smokin' Gunn vs. Body Donnas & Ahmed Johnson vs. Jeff Jarrett.

1997 - The main event was the hometown hero Shawn Michaels challenging WWE Champion Sysco Sid in a Survivor Series rematch with this also being the last time that his manager Jose Lothario would be in his corner with Shawn having a new (or his old) attitude but also fighting the fact that he was wrestling with a high temperature due to the flu in a match that showed signs of ""deju"" from their previous encounter.  The Royal Rumble battle royal itself featured such highlights as many of the matches earlier in the card picking up right where they left off, the dominance of Steve Austin & his constant encounters with Bret Hart, the issues between Tag Team Champions British Bulldog & Owen Hart, one person almost setting a record, the hardcore Foley/Funk feud continuing once again, and the controversial ending.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion Hunter Hearst-Helmsley vs. Goldust, Ahmed Johnson vs. Faarooq, Vader vs. Undertaker with an unexpected appearance, and a special attraction of a six man tag match featuring stars of the A.A.A. promotion in Mexico.

1998 - The event had a special guest in boxing legend Mike Tyson watching the show from a skybox in the arena.  The main story going into the Royal Rumble battle royal was Steve Austin responding to the claims of being a marked man in the match by attacking the participants for weeks leading up to this match to the point where all the action in the ring stopped & everyone waited on him once it was time for him to enter the match with other highlights include Mick Foley & Terry Funk picking up where they left off the previous year, who was attacked on his way to the ring & got his payback later on, who took up to six men to be eliminated, every Nation member for himself, and who had up to three different chances to win the match.  Undertaker competed in his second Casket Match in WWE history facing off against WWE Champion Shawn Michaels with D-Generation X members Triple H & Chyna in his corner in a match that's mostly remembered for not just the bump Shawn took on the casket that began the end of his career at the point but who decided to make their appearance leading to an aftermath that left everyone speechless.  Other matches include Intercontinental Champion The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. Legion Of Doom, Vader vs. Artist Formerly Known As Goldust, and a six man match featuring the mini-wrestlers from Mexico with Sunny as the special referee.

1999 - The special theme was ""No Chance In Hell"" as Mr. McMahon was determined to make sure Steve Austin didn't win the match & receive a WWE Title match at WrestleMania to the point where he made Austin the first entrant, put himself in the Rumble match (with Shawn Michaels making him #2), and put out a $100,000 reward on whoever eliminated Austin leading to such moments as the entire Austin-McMahon saga, the circumstances surrounding the eliminations of Mabel & Kane, and Chyna becoming the first woman to compete in the match at #30.  The match that had everyone talking after the event was the WWE Champion Mankind vs. The Rock in an ""I Quit"" match that started off as a brawl that went all over ringside to just downright brutal with the image of Mankind handcuffed & taking close to a dozen chairshots to the head to the point where his wife took the kids away from ringside because it was too much to handle with this match being detailed more in the film ""Beyond The Mat.""  Other matches include Road Dogg vs. Big Boss Man, Intercontinental Champion Ken Shamrock vs. Billy Gunn, European Champion X-Pac vs. Gangrel, and Womens Champion Sable vs. Luna in a Strap Match.

2000 - The Rumble match this year featured such highlights as a couple of men who weren't legally entered into the Rumble invading the match leading to one man taking a vicious over the top face plant & another being eliminated more times in a single Rumble match than anyone else in Rumble history, Too Cool & Rikishi, one man making surprise appearance who was also running for Congress, and the interaction between Big Show & The Rock.  WWE Champion Triple H faced off against Mick Foley's most dangerous persona of Cactus Jack in a Street Fight match that saw both men just beat the hell out of each other all over ringside with blood pouring from more than just one part of the body, various weapons including chairs & thumbtacks & ""Barbie"", more than one person making an appearance to make a difference in the match, and an aftermath where one man refused to let the other leave on a stretcher.  The first ever Tables Match happened between The Hardys & Dudley Boyz that saw both men use tables in ways that haven't been previously seen in WWE either as weapons or the unique ways people were put through them.  Other matches include Taz's debut vs. Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho vs. Chyna vs. Hardcore Holly to determine the undisputed Intercontinental Champion, Tag Team Champions New Age Outlaws vs. A.P.A., and a Miss Rumble 2000 bikini contest where we saw it all from bubble wrap to a very old set of puppies.

2001 - The Rumble match itself had it's various highlights such as a few guest appearances from comedian Drew Carey to the return of a former World Champion & later a WCW champion who appeared on their PPV the week before, a new Royal Rumble record set that wouldn't be broken for over a decade, the Rumble getting hardcore, not even the spanish announce table being safe, a reunion between ""brothers"", and how one man entered the match a bloody mess.  WWE Champion Kurt Angle defended the championship against Triple H but the biggest story surrounding the match was fact that Trish Stratus & Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley were the managers for this match with each girl having a big issue with the other to the point where it did boil over into a fight that had everyone in the ring stop what they were doing & causing the one person caught in the middle to try to break it up.  The first ever Ladder Match in Rumble history occurred as Chris Benoit defended his Intercontinental Title against Chris Jericho in a very physical match that saw not only the ladder used but a chair as well to the point where the winner didn't walk out 100%.  Other matches include Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz & Womens Champion Ivory vs. Chyna.

2002 - The Rumble match itself featured various highlights such as the 4 returns of Val Venis & Goldust & The Godfather complete with one of the biggest ""Ho-Trains"" in history, the biggest upset elimination in the history of the match...and the aftermath of it, one legends outstanding performance that earned himself a job, another Rumble record being set, the in-ring return of Triple H & who was waiting for him in the ring, and when it got down to the final four.  Ric Flair returned to his old WCW hometown of Atlanta for his in-ring return in a Street Fight against fellow co-owner Mr. McMahon in a street fight that turned out to be bloody & aggressive between both men with Flair's family sitting in the front row to witness everything.  Other matches include WWE Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho vs. The Rock, Intercontinental Champion Edge vs. William Regal, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Jazz, and Tag Team Champions Spike Dudley & Tazz vs. Dudley Boyz.

2003 - This edition of the Royal Rumble which was very unique in that it was first one held under the brand extension meaning the format of the Rumble was changed this year with 15 wrestlers from RAW & SmackDown entered into the match also making this the first time that all superstars have interacted with each other with the winner receiving a shot at their brand's champion at WrestleMania leading to such moments as Shawn Michaels' return to the Rumble match at #1 with Chris Jericho ""scheduled"" at #2, Edge & reunions of Edge & Christian along with the Hardy Boyz, Dreamer getting hardcore, Matt Hardy's ""Mattitude Follower"" Shannon Moore getting involved, Maven attempting ""deja vu"", the return of Undertaker, and the final four.  WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit has gone down as a pure technical wrestling classic encounter based off quality in-ring mat wrestling & submissions to the point where both the winner & loser got standing ovations after the match.  RAW's World Championship match was a different story as Triple H defended the championship against Scott Steiner in a match that was just bad as these two had no chemistry on this night with the crowd clearly turning on the match with an ending that didn't help matters at all.  Other matches include Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show with the winner entering the Rumble match later that night, World Tag Team Champions Lance Storm & William Regal vs. Dudley Boyz, and Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie.

2004 - The Rumble this year had a slight change to the stipulation where the winner would be allowed to choose which brands championship they would compete for at WrestleMania featuring such highlights as Chris Benoit coming in at #1, a message delivered to Kane with one entrant paying for it, a superstar being knocked out backstage so another man could take his place who had issues about being called a ""coward"" for weeks, ""Somebody Call My Momma!"", the dominance of Big Show, who interfered in the match targeting Goldberg, the final three, and history being made more than once.  World Champion Triple H defended the championship against his old rival in Shawn Michaels in a Last Man Standing Match in a very physical bloody match that saw more an one person stretchered out.  Other matches include WWE Champion Brock Lesnar vs. Hardcore Holly, Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero, Crusierweight Champion Rey Mysterio vs. Jamie Noble, and World Tag Team Champions Ric Flair & Batista vs. Dudley Boyz in a Tables Match.

2005 - The Rumble match itself featured such highlights as who were the first two entrants, Tough Enough winner Daniel Puder becoming a target for a game of ""can you top this?"", a repeat of the RAW vs. SmackDown ""West Side Story"" themed Rumble commercial complete with the General Managers at ringside as well, everyone showing that they had one common enemy, how one man taking another man's number in the match ended up resulting in the start of build up to what was a huge ""dream match"" at the time, how we almost had history repeated between the final two with Mr. McMahon tearing both of his quad muscles in the process, and it wasn't part of the match itself but the backstage interaction all night before the match between Eddie Guerrero & Ric Flair.  Other matches include World Champion Triple H vs. Randy Orton with Evolution banned from ringside, WWE Champion J.B.L. vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show that saw everyone's allies try to help out as much as can, Undertaker vs. Heidenreich in a Casket Match that saw one man attempt to get involved resulting in ""little brother"" making his presence known as well, and Edge vs. Shawn Michaels.

2006 - The Rumble match itself featured such highlights as a new record set, some comedic eliminations, Rob Van Dam's return, the McMahon's making their presence known, and the final three.  Edge shocked the world earlier in the month by becoming the first man who cash in his Money In The Bank briefcase to defeat John Cena, after he had just went survived an Elimination Chamber match, to win the WWE Championship leading to the rematch here with John Cena making quite an entrance on a steel catwalk scaffold in a back & forth encounter.  Other matches include World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry that was more memorable for who decided to issue a challenge to the winner, Mickie James vs. Ashley with Trish Stratus as the referee, Boogeyman vs. J.B.L., and a six way Crusierweight Championship match.

2007 - This edition was very unique in that it was first one to include the new ECW brand.  The Rumble match itself featured such highlights as more than one new records set, the hardcore influence of the ""extreme"" superstars & without a doubt the greatest final 10 minutes of the match in the history of the match as we got a special ""match"" inside the match.  WWE Champion John Cena defended the title in a Last Man Standing match against Umaga that saw various weapons involved such as the steel steps, television monitor, and announce table along with a way to keep one man down that I've never seen before or since that match.  Other matches include World Champion Batista vs. Mr. Kennedy, ECW Champion Bobby Lashley vs. Test, and The Hardys vs. MNM.",1174608000,14,21756,4.767614996011699

The Rumble match itself featured such highlights as who were the first two entrants, Tough Enough winner Daniel Puder becoming a target for a game of ""can you top this?"", a repeat of the RAW vs. SmackDown ""West Side Story"" themed Rumble commercial complete with the General Managers at ringside as well, everyone showing that they had one common enemy, how one man taking another man's number in the match ended up resulting in the start of build up to what was a huge ""dream match"" at the time, how we almost had history repeated between the final two with Mr. McMahon tearing both of his quad muscles in the process, and it wasn't part of the match itself but the backstage interaction all night before the match between Eddie Guerrero & Ric Flair.  Other matches include World Champion Triple H vs. Randy Orton with Evolution banned from ringside, WWE Champion J.B.L. vs. Kurt Angle vs. Big Show that saw everyone's allies try to help out as much as can, Undertaker vs. Heidenreich in a Casket Match that saw one man attempt to get involved resulting in ""little brother"" making his presence known as well, and Edge vs. Shawn Michaels.

2006 - Miami, FL once again host this event from the American Airlines Arena featuring the Rumble debuts of Joey Styles, Mickie James, Bobby Lashley, Super Crazy, Psicosis, and MNM (Johnny Nitro/John Morrison, Joey Mercury, Melina).  The Rumble match itself featured such highlights as a new record set, some comedic eliminations, Rob Van Dam's return, the McMahon's making their presence known, and the final three.  Edge shocked the world earlier in the month by becoming the first man who cash in his Money In The Bank briefcase to defeat John Cena, after he had just went survived an Elimination Chamber match, to win the WWE Championship leading to the rematch here with John Cena making quite an entrance on a steel catwalk scaffold in a back & forth encounter.  Other matches include World Champion Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry that was more memorable for who decided to issue a challenge to the winner, Mickie James vs. Ashley with Trish Stratus as the referee, Boogeyman vs. J.B.L., and a six way Crusierweight Championship match.

2007 - The Rumble came back to San Antonio, TX after a decade from the AT&T Center which was very unique in that it was first one to include the new ECW brand as this event featured the Rumble debuts of Mr. Kennedy, Umaga, Finlay, Sabu, C.M. Punk, Sandman, M.V.P., Great Khali, and The Miz.  The Rumble match itself featured such highlights as more than one new records set, the hardcore influence of the ""extreme"" superstars & without a doubt the greatest final 10 minutes of the match in the history of the match as we got a special ""match"" inside the match.  WWE Champion John Cena defended the title in a Last Man Standing match against Umaga that saw various weapons involved such as the steel steps, television monitor, and announce table along with a way to keep one man down that I've never seen before or since that match.  Other matches include World Champion Batista vs. Mr. Kennedy, ECW Champion Bobby Lashley vs. Test, and The Hardys vs. MNM.",1174608000,4,6170,4.813799621928166
2691425,4,B000KHX71W,"MNM vs. Hardyz - This ""on again/off again"" feud goes on for another PPV.  This doesn't top their previous matches but this was a great match to start the PPV & get the crowd going.  It doesn't disappoint but don't expect to be blown away either.

ECW Champion Lashley vs. Test - Remember HHH vs. Steiner at the Rumble in 2003 that was just bad & had a crappy ending to boot...the only reason this match doesn't rank up there with it is that it didn't go as long.  What I don't understand is that they gave this match away the week before & the week after this...anyways, the less said the better.

World Champion Batista vs. Mr. Kennedy - I swear I was watching JBL/Cena from WM21 because Kennedy OWNED Batista throughout a majority of the match with his wrestling & submission moves until Batista did his ""hulking up"" & hit his usual finisher to win.  Typical Batista performance but it was better than his matches with King Booker & it's watchable so I'll give it some credit.

Last Man Standing: WWE Champion John Cena vs. Umaga - This heavily made up for their NYR match as there was alot of blood and some good spots with tables & the steel steps at ringside.  This match was just full of wreckless violence & the image at the end with Cena using the ringropes to choke Umaga out was something to see.

Royal Rumble Match - Unlike most recent Royal Rumble's, they didn't do alot during this match to set up future WrestleMania matches but overall it was solid.  The real highlight was when it got down to Rated RKO, Undertaker & HBK as they gave up one of the best finish moments in Rumble history.  The Taker/HBK showdown at the end was really the match of the night for me as it was something he haven't seen in a very long time (they last time they met was back at the Rumble in 1998) and you honestly didn't know who was going to win unlike previous Rumble matches.  Undertaker has now FINALLY done everything there is to do in the WWE and finally the #30 man won the match.

DVD extras include the World Tag Team Title where Rated RKO lost the belts to Cena & HBK, the segment on RAW where Donald Trump first appeared & dropped money onto the fans, and Kane congradulating Undertaker on winning.  Blockbuster Video has a bonus DVD (which WWE seems to be doing alot lately with different stores) but none of the ones near me carry wrestling DVD's anymore so I can't speak on that.

Overall, I recommend this as the only two bad matches were very short & won't put you to sleep.",1174608000,,2486,4.35064935064935
2691426,5,B000KHX71W,"I had been waiting for the release of this package from when it was announced.  Naturally, I am just so happy to finally have this anthology.

There are a few very minor details that kind of bug me.  I believe it is the 1996 disc that has pretty poor audio.  It sounds like they are trying to play the audio way too loud.

The second is the disc from 1992 or 1993, it just looks a little grainy, even compared to the earlier years.  I am sure this is simply due to the company not having DVD quality masters to work with.

There are a few times when the Fink is introducing someone, and you can see that it is cleary an overdub, just to replace the entrance music.  I think that is more neat than annoying, because they went to some lengths to try to replace the audio.

If you are a fan of the WWF/WWE, especially of the late 80's/early 90's, you owe it to yourself to make this purchase.  I grew up watching this stuff with my cousins and grandpa, so, I felt this was a piece of nostalgia that would be cherished by my family for years to come.

My package has also split open like a few people have mentioned, I will probably have to tape it up sometime in the next day or two.",1174521600,4,1180,4.086956521739131

1. MNM vs. The Hardy Boyz- This was a very solid opener to kick off the show. I will say that it was a step down form their match at December to dismember but not by much. There was a lot of fast paced action to kick off the match but than it slowed down a little bit. Hardy got the hot tag but the ref did not see it. They finally got the tag for real and matt cleaned house. Lots of high flying moves some near falls and a good ending to top it all off. There was one little problem as it seems that MNM is still jobbing to the hardys every time they face and I wish that would not happen oh well. Winners the Hardy Boyz. Match Rating 8/10.

2. Bobby Lashley vs. Test for the ECW world title- This by far was the worst match on the card. All in all the match was very poor. The sad thing was the had the same match on free tv the same week and the match on tv was better than the one on the ppv. The match was slow and boring but I will mostly say that was due to with test. There were some nice power moves but the ending was ridiculous as it ended it count out and the crowd crapped all over the match. Winner and still ecw champ Bobby Lashley. Match Rating 3/10.

3. Batistia vs. Mr Kenndey for the WHT- This was a better match than I thought it was going to be. This is all due to mr kennedy because he saved this match. I have thought for a long time batistia has looked sloppy and he did in this match. There were some sweet submission moves by kennedy and he had a lot of the crowd behind him as well. Batsistia fought back hit like two moves and won the match but still a very solid match. Winner and still WHC Batistia. Match Rating 7.5/10.

4. John Cena vs. Umaga in a last man standing match for the WWE title- This was the surprise of the night and it was a fun match to watch. It started out but a little slow and soon picked up. The only downfall of this match was there were not a lot of weapons used like they usually do in last man standing match. There were some steel steps but that's about it. There was tons of blood in this match as well. There was also a nice table spot were umaga ran across three tables looking for a big splash on cena but he missed and crashed through the table. The ring was taken apart and cena used the ropes to chock out umaga. Great match. Winner and still wwe champ John Cena. Match Rating 9/10.

5. The Royal Rumble Match- This was a great royal rumble. I though this was one of the best royal rumbles I have seen in a while. I think it would have been nice if ECW had not jobbed to everyone and they only had one elemination in the whole match. There was a really sweet spot where sabu was on the ring apron and was chock slammed thorugh a table by kane on the outside. Match was really flowing really weel but the best was when it was down to rated rko and michales and taker. This was a non stop of 10 minutes of action. There was some sick chair shots on taker that busted  him wide open. It came down to michales and taker and they did not disappoint. Non stop action with conters and finishers but taker got the better of michales. Great match great rumble. Winner Undertaker. Match Rating 9/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give royal rumble 2007 a grade of 36.5/50 which is a 73% which means this is an awesome ppv. This was one of the wwe better ppvs in a long time they really stepped it up here and I would recommend this to anyone.",1174521600,,3474,4.049562682215743
2691428,3,B000KHX71W,"...thus the 3 star review. While the video quality is wonderful, the outer ""book"" packaging began to split along the edges after the first time I opened the set. (I've been buying DVDs and DVD sets for nearly 10 years, so I know a thing or two about being careful.)

Since NO retailer accepts returns on open DVD media, I have been forced to patch the set with packaging tape. Yep - I had to use TAPE on a DVD set with an SRP of $270. Thankfully, I managed to pay about 1/2 that, plus S/H and tax. Still sucks, though, that I had to do that.",1174176000,3,541,4.05607476635514
2691429,5,B000KHX71W,"I LOVE the Royal Rumble Anthology more than the Wrestlemania Anthology and everyone knows how good the Wrestlemania Anthology was when it debuted last year. First of all, from disc one all the way to the end this bad boy is action packed. Unlike the Wrestlemania, which were tough to sit through disc one, two, and some of three. With over 50+ Hours of footage Its hard to put the remote down and go to bed. One will be pulling an allnighter just to watch that little bit more. That my friends is a true sign of a great DVD collection.",1174176000,,535,4.306930693069307
2691430,3,B000KHX71W,"MNM v. The Hardy Boyz-- I was mildly dissapointed in this. It did what it was supposed to in terms of getting the crowd going, but seemed stuck in second gear, which is surprising seeing as these guys all seem to have great chemistry with each other. This is certainly a solid little offering but don't expect your doors to get blown off. **

ECW World Championship

Lashley v. Test-- Yikes this may beat out HHH-Steiner a few years ago for the worst Rumble title match in history. If not, it's close. Absolutely heat-less match with one of the most indescribable endings i've ever seen in a title match. Almost worth it to watch just for it's awful-ness. DUD

World Heavyweight Championship

Batista v. Mr. Kennedy-- A lot better than I expected but still not outstanding. Kennedy's the new 'net-cadet flavor of the week, so the reaction to this match was a little over the top at first. Kennedy sells his back side off for Batista but doesn't get much in return. All the arm work in the world and then a Batista bomb at the end was a little off, but at least they pulled off Kennedy being a consistent thorn in the champion's side. Again, this is certainly solid, but not all that wonderful. **1/2

WWE Championship-- Last Man Standing

John Cena v. Umaga-- Flat out, this is probably the best World title match  the WWE's put out at least since Eddie-JBL at JD '04 if not since the Benoit-Angle match at Royal Rumble 2003. This was absolutely outstanding in every way. Both men really carried the load well. The violence escalates gradually with Umaga getting more wild and wreckless as his frustration mounts at not being able to put Cena away. Cena gets lucky and manages to almost kill the challenger to beat him. The visual of Cena choking the bejesus out of Umaga was awesome. Just an fantastic match that is worth the cost of the DVD itself. ****1/2

Royal Rumble Match-- I wouldn't put this up there with the best of all time bell to bell, but it was certainly well booked and a ton of fun. The last 10 minutes on the other hand, was perhaps the best i've seen out of a Rumble save for perhaps the Benoit-Big Show-Angle final three in 04. The ending is one of those 'moments' and you get to see the two guys who understand and execute the 'big moment' better than anyone else in the company really go for it. An average Rumble match with an incredibly spectacular ending. ***1/4

This is a solid show. Last year's Rumble was absolutely terrible in every way and this year's offering was a huge step up. The insane San Antonio crowd made it a lot of fun. This pay per view really marked the beginning of a huge upswing in WWE programming. I'd reccomend this show if for nothing else other than to see the incredible WWE title match and the insanity of the last 10 minutes of the Rumble itself. A whole hell of a lot of fun.",1174003200,3,2832,4.441233140655106
2691431,4,B000KHX71W,"I was very surprised when receiving my box set. The packaging was like a fold out book and that in itself held the box sets with a ribbon to pull out four booklets which held the dvd's. The booklets contained all dvd's which not one of them were dislodged surprisingly, because shipping the item could do that.

The dvd's were easy to take out without having to bend the dvd's. If you bought recent WWE dvd's such as the WWE Championship Legacy or the Ultimate Hulk Hogan anthology dvd, the setup in the booklet was exactly the same as these, plastic pages where you can turn, like a book. The design on the boxset is great. WWE outdid themselves with this one, probably seeing the error of their ways with the Wrestlemania Anthology. As far as watching the set, I have not gotten to it.

Many of the videos from the early eighties through the mid nineties are hard to come by and/or in poor condition.  I look forward to the hopeful release of other anthology's in the future.  The Royal Rumble has always been one of my personal favorites and I love how I can sit and watch it on DVD compared to VHS.

2691448,3,B000KHX71W,"The 2007 Royal Rumble started out great and ended great, but was dreadful in between. The opening match, MNM versus the Hardy Boyz was an excellent way to kick off the show, with two of the WWE's most talented duos putting on a great match. It was a real treat to see both teams reunited, if only for a few matches. The match may have been better served if it were a bit longer, but as far as opening matches go, it was kept to a reasonable length.

The first main-event, as the WWE would say, was Bobbly Lashley defending the ECW title against Test. I really have very little to say about this. Neither Lashley nor Test are good performers, and when you put them in the ring together, it just hurts to watch. The ending was just another disappointing aspect of a very disappointing match.

The middle match on the card was World Heavyweight Champion Batista versus Ken Kennedy. Although this match was probably featured the best wrestling of the three title matches, it was nothing spectacular. As we have seen in the past, Batista is not an especially good worker, and Kennedy is not the type, good though he is, that can carry a weak wrestler. There were a few very nice spots, though, and although the match was unbelievably predictable, it was hardly the squash match that people expected.

The third title match featured WWE Champion John Cena battling the Samoan Bulldozer Umaga in a Last Man Standing Match. The only thing that saved this match was the Last Man Standing stipulation. Umaga (formerly Rosey of 3 Minute Warning) is a terrible performer and Cena is average at best when put against a poor competitor. The gimmick nature of the match allowed Cena and Umaga to blind the fans with lots of blood and violence. However, even as far as Last Man Standing matches go, this one was a disappointing. Recall the Triple H versus Shawn Michaels Last Man Standing match a couple of Royal Rumbles back. That is what a Last Man Standing match should look like. Wrestling with the violence and aggression needed to get the point across. Umaga versus Cena was merely violence with a little wrestling to remind the fans that this wasn't a bad episode of Cops.

The Royal Rumble match itself was excellent, certainly surpassing the 2006 Rumble match. Although the pace was slower than usual, it did not drag on as the 2006 match did, but instead seemed much livelier than it actually was. The match really picked up when it got down to the final four, and concluded with one of the best one on one showdowns to end any Royal Rumble match to date. What made the conclusion even better was that it featured four wrestlers who had at least a decent chance of winning. More specifically, the final two really seemed a coin toss and was terribly exciting.

Unless you are a Royal Rumble fanatic, I cant recommend that you buy this DVD. The card, only five matches in total, was pretty weak and had only two good matches. While the main event itself was excellent, the rest of the matches are not worth your money. As a side note, if you do intend to buy this product, you may consider waiting for the Royal Rumble box set to come out which is due, I believe, in April. However, WWE has not clearly stated whether the 2007 Royal Rumble will be included, there is no reason for it not to be.",1171152000,3,3287,4.517647058823529

2691454,4,B000KHX71W,"Finally, I say, finally WWE delivers a PPV with quality again. It isn't what you could call ""one for the ages"", but it is miles better than anything in 2006.

The opener, The Hardy Boyz vs. MNM, was already very entertaining and promising. No big, pretentious stories, just good wrestling. That's something I would really like to see more of, please. And the comeback of the Hardy Boyz can only be good for the Tag Team division.

The ECW World Title was on the line next, with Bobby Lashley facing Test. The quibble I have with this match does not so much come from the performance, which was all that it could have been considering the skills of both contestants, but rather the idea itself.

You already have the WWE Championship and the World Heavyweight Championship - adding the ECW title is just too much. A PPV can't only consist of World Championship matches, it devalues them. Just look at the fate of the WCW World Title, which in the end changed owners from show to show. But Vince McMahon owns three companies, the question is: what to do with them? More on this issue later.

Now, Batista defended his World Heavyweight title against Mr. Kennedy. I'm not quite sure where he came from, but Mr. Kennedy is dull as hell. That's really the crux with WWE stars nowadays, they suddenly pop up and then vanish into the dark again. The problem is that those people get a mega- push, headline a PPV- main event, preferrably against John Cena or Batista, they lose it, WWE suddenly realises that the fans aren't into that guy at all, and forthwith he dwells amongst midcarders. Case in point: Randy Orton. Or Mr. Kennedy.

To make a real champion, a real star, you have to take one, two or even three years into account. Case in point: Triple H. Shawn Michaels. Bret Hart.

The match itself wasn't that bad, but given the limited abilities of both, Kennedy AND Batista, it couldn't have been much more.

WWE Championship Match, Last Man Standing: John Cena vs. Umaga

Great match. I don't really think Umaga should ever become World Champion, but why not try? And by god, they tried to prove he's worthy! That being said, he reminds me of Meng. And in all honesty, I doubt I'll ever think of him as more than that.

I'm still no Cena- fan, and in my opinion he still has to prove that he can deliver top notch performances in a pure wrestling match without any props or gimmicks, but this was an intense, entertaining, and satisfying match- up.

The Royal Rumble Match

Given that this Royal Rumble took place in San Antonio, Texas, there was no chance in hell of Shawn Michaels not being amongst the final four in the ring.

About the rest of the big rumble; well, it was a rumble, which means, like always, it became really interesting when about 10 men remained.

I have to say, that The Undertaker and Michaels were the final two was really surprising for me. And even more surprising was that Undertaker finally eliminated HBK. But I am by no means opposed to the Undertaker winning the World Title, quite on the contrary: I think WWE sorely needs a big name attached to the WWE Title for some time to sort things out. And that's what WWE really needs to do, clean up.

Before I close this review, I would like to bring up the ""three titles in one"" discussion. I think everyone can see that the current solution of Vince McMahon is not all that it could be. How can you defend three individual titles in the same ring and expect it to be believable? In my opinion, what WWE has to go back to is the first rule of pro wrestling: pretend the audience doesn't know it's all show.

Then, Vinnie Mac has three options:

- take all three promotions he owns (WWE, WCW, ECW), polish them up, and let them run individually, with their own shows, their own PPVs.

- take WCW and ECW, bury their name, and unify them under the big name ""WWE"".

- unify Smackdown, Raw and ECW, and resurrect WCW as a counterpart to WWE

I assume there are more possibilities, but one thing Vince really needs to do is get rid of that unbelievably pretentious Raw Vs. Smackdown crap. If that's the big storyline WWE tries to draw its energy from, then they are already forfeit.

Nevertheless, Royal Rumble 2007 remains a very good PPV, and if this is a signal for 2007, we might be about to witness a really good year for WWE.",1170115200,,4306,4.468112244897959

8156986,4,B000KHX71W,"I really enjoyed this volume of the Royal Rumble. Here are my thoughts of each of the Royal Rumble events:
2003) I liked the beginning match-up between Brock Lesnar & the Big Show, since it brought some bit of closure to Brock Lesnar over his title loss to Big Show at the previous years Survivor Series. I didn't like the woman's match, just a waste of time. Scott Steiner did seem to be dominant against Triple H in their World Heavyweight title match, even though I think that the DQ victory was a put down to the title, course their rematch at the next pay-per-view was just a massive disappointment. I really enjoyed the WWE title match between Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit (RIP), it just seemed to be a very good match-up between those two nearly-equaled wrestlers who became the first-ever WWE Tag-Team Champions the previous year, & there were just really impressive counters (among other things) between the two. And Benoit did deserve a standing ovation after the match from the audience for his effort. As for the Royal Rumble match, it was a really good deception at the start of the match between Shawn Michaels, Chris Jericho & Christian. I think that Brock Lesnar should have entered the match earlier instead of later on, & I also think that there should have been more confrontation between Brock Lesnar & the returning Undertaker since they had a tremendous rivalry the previous year in which they headlined two pay-per-views in a row.
2004) I somewhat liked the ""fight"" between Eddie Guerrero (RIP) and his nephew Chavo that did seem to be personal between the two, course Eddie would win the WWE title at the next pay-per-view which became one of the most emotional moments in WWE history. I didn't like the WWE title match between Brock Lesnar & Hardcore Holly though, since Lesnar portrayed a psychotic wrestler that was ""released"" the previous year even though he was doing really well as a fan favorite. But I really enjoyed the Last Man Standing match between Shawn Michaels & Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship in which the match ended when both men couldn't get up before the count of ten after Shawn Michaels super-kicked Triple H when both men were busted open during the coarse of the match. The Royal Rumble match itself did serve as a some kind of Cinderella-story for Chris Benoit (RIP), in which Benoit would then be drafted to RAW after winning the Royal Rumble match & would then headline WrestleMania 20 in order to win the World Heavyweight title in the main-event. I also enjoyed The Undertaker's gong which distracted his half-brother Kane to be eliminated as well as the brawl between Randy Orton & Mick Foley.
2005) Not much to say about this Royal Rumble event other than saying that ending to the Royal Rumble match was a bit controversial between the future mega-stars John Cena & Batista, even though Vince McMahon did tear both his quad muscles when trying to get into the ring. I liked the ending to the Casket match between The Undertaker & Heidenreich when Kane emerged from the casket to fend-off Gene Snitsky in order for The Undertaker to defeat Heidenreich by sealing him into the casket. I also read that Randy Orton suffered a concussion during his World Heavyweight title match against Triple H. But both John Cena & Batista did went on to headline WrestleMania 21 in order to win their first WWE & World Heavyweight titles from JBL & Triple H.
2006) All I can say about this Royal Rumble event is that the match wasn't the main event, other than saying that Rey Mysterio did put up one hell of a performance in order to win the Royal Rumble for his late friend Eddie Guerrero, even though Triple H did not have a very good night when he kept being attacked by those who were wronged by him. But I do have to say that Rey Mysterio & Triple H did have a very good chemistry between the two during the match. And I also liked the WWE Championship match between John Cena & Edge as well as the part when Rey Mysterio was backstage drawing his number along with The Big Show.
2007) My favorite Royal Rumble event in terms of two matches. Though I didn't like the ECW & the World Heavyweight title matches. But the Last Man Standing match-up for the WWE Championship between John Cena & Umaga (RIP) was a thrill ride from start to finish. And in terms of the Royal Rumble match itself, I really enjoyed the ending of the match when The Undertaker came in to eliminate The Great Khali, Rated-RKO, among others until it came down to the final 2 between Shawn Michaels & The Undertaker in which they both stole the show that night.
