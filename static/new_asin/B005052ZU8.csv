4511495,1,B005052ZU8,I agree with the other reviews. I only made it through the Hip Hop DVD and it was awful. Very poor quality. Don't waste your money.,1328745600,,131,4.076923076923077
4511496,1,B005052ZU8,"I was suckered in by the great cover and the promise of good workouts in different dance styles, bhe actual DVDs left a lot to be desired.

They were filmed in a dingy little studio and the cameraperson couldn't hold the camera quite steady enough on the almost arial shots (not actually an overhead shot so you could see what was happening, but sort of upper corner zoomed in vantage point? No idea why they switched to it occasionally, other than to hide any cuts from the instructors screwing up).

The instructors gave almost no instructions, and had the ""beginner"" viewers combining numerous moves/body parts right off the bat. Also, there was no warm up. Plus, the music in the belly dance one was really slow and dreamy, and totally calming, rather than dancercise-inspiring. The hiphop one was slightly better, though not actually hiphop music or moves.

Also, though it is under the name ""Denice Druce,"" she is not the instructor on the disks I watched. One of the instructors even got her own patter and the other instructor's moves wrong occasionally.

In conclusion. It is sooooo not worth the price. I paid 9.99 for it at Kmart, and no one should have to pay that, let alone the 39.99 that Amazon is charging. For a beginner, I'd recommend the 10 minute workout series, which has a few dance workouts.",1326931200,,1314,4.7
4511497,1,B005052ZU8,"I picked this set of DVDs up hoping for a fun, challenging, and entertaining workout. These DVDs are the worst quality fitness DVDs I've ever seen (and I have a lot of them). 1) There is very little instruction or direction on how do to anything. 2) The music from the belly dance DVD is from a yoga CD that I have - it's just not suitable for belly dance. All the music is horrible 3) The quality of the film is very poor. They are set up in some white, almost dirty looking studio. 4) I didn't get a workout. The moves were boring and poorly executed. Please don't buy this.",1317081600,10,576,4.151785714285714
4511498,1,B005052ZU8,"I bought this set over the weekend from Target for $19.99 and it was one of the worst purchases I have ever made in my life! The cover looked fun so I got suckered. Don't let it fool you, too!! It was labeled ""Beginner Level"" but it had to have been made for people with ""special needs"" in mind. I don't want to be mean but there are no words to describe how awful this DVD set is.

If you are still interested in purchasing, I will sell it to you for $1 plus shipping!!",1309824000,7,470,3.9473684210526314
8450664,1,B005052ZU8,"I am sooooo glad that I'm not the only one that thought this was awful.  I just can't get over how terrible it is...  I was doing the workout and fantasizing about writing this review, it's that bad.  It might be fine for someone who is just starting a work out routine...  The work outs are short and the only redeeming quality is that a friendly timer pops up on screen when there is 15, 10 and 5 minutes to go.

As a dancer myself, I was intrigued by this 4 disc set, thinking that it would be some true dancing...  it offered jazz dance!!!  That's why I was so excited to try it!  (very few exercise dvds offer jazz!...)  but it's soooooo poorly taught that I felt embarrassed doing it by myself in my own home!!!  This Denise character is a terrible aerobics instructor and doesn't know:
1. how to count
2. her left from her right
3. her own routine
4. anything about jazz
5. how to count rhythm
6. how to properly stretch after exercising (teaching stretches that would injure someone who didn't know better!!!)

Way to go Target.  I was suckered.  With so many wonderful (or at least decent) workout videos out there, don't even bother with this one!!!!!!!!!!",1408492800,,1166,4.417840375586854
8450665,2,B005052ZU8,"This is a very low-budget set of brief workouts set to music. If you are overweight and trying to get yourself to move around for 20 or 25 minutes it might be just fine. The sound quality is bad and it looks like it was filmed in a garage. The music for the hip hop and belly dancing videos just doesn't work, but you can get a little bit of cardio from these workouts.",1396137600,,369,4.0
8450666,1,B005052ZU8,"This was everything the other reviewers said. It should only be found in a one dollar store. Bought at Target. Amazon should rethink selling it because of the false labeling. Recording dates should be listed honestly on the package and details here, but they are not. The date on the label is a remarketing date. Buy it if you want to laugh at outdated goofy jazzercising.",1371600000,,372,4.651515151515151
8450667,1,B005052ZU8,"I bought this dvd set at Target.  The cover art is nothing like the dvds.  They are horrible.  I've taken belly dance lessons and the belly dance on here is a joke.  In my opinion the Hip Hop should not be categorized as Hip Hop.  It is very disappointing.  Luckily, I called Target and they said I can return it.  I will be doing so today.  This is not worth your money.",1367798400,,371,4.055555555555555
8450668,1,B005052ZU8,"This was soooo disappointing! Like the others, I was fooled by the cover.  I would give a negative count if I could too because the instruction seemed to be designed for people with very little rhythm, endurance, and knowledge of dance forms and exercise.  Luckily, Target allowed me to exchange this dvd set for another. So I got the ""Dance Mix"" set by Crunch, which was MUUUUUCHHH BETTERRR!!!",1365465600,,394,4.779411764705882
8450669,1,B005052ZU8,Totally duped by the cover art. This was filmed in a dirty garage. Denise says the wrong direction several times. It confuses the backup dancers and thus the viewer. She has absolutely no energy.  It is laughable. Go for a walk instead!,1362009600,,236,4.619047619047619
8450670,1,B005052ZU8,"Dingy setting, instructors who clearly know nothing about the genre they're teaching, and awkward studio dancers. Total waste of money!",1361664000,,135,5.8
8450671,3,B005052ZU8,"I've read all of the reviews for this product and believe that it is vastly underrated.

I am a low intermediate exerciser in my twenties who's getting better at catching on to choreography after working out for a few years.  I put my all in each DVD and thought they matched my exertion level perfectly.

Packaging: All four DVDs were in little plastic/cardboard slips instead of their own solid compartment.  I took a star off because I thought that was lazy.

Setting: It is low budget and each DVD is set in what looks like a basement or private home-gym.  I thought this gave the routines a more ""personal"" or ""quaint"" atmosphere so I didn't mind.

Hip-Hop for Beginners:  I'm a novice at hip-hop dancing but felt like I caught on to this short routine well the first time.  The instructor is a young redheaded male who seems very experienced in this field and doesn't go too quickly through the moves.  I had fun and added my own flair in less than half an hour.  Some moves were higher impact.

Salsa Cardio Workout:  This one was my favorite since I love Latin dancing.  If you concentrate on keeping your stomach in and moving your hips, you feel like you're getting a bit of a toning workout along with the cardio.  The instructor had an 80s style and seemed stiff (not to mention she didn't always properly cue) but she was very enthusiastic and I enjoyed this one the most.  This was all low impact with a few toning moves thrown in.

Jazz Dance Workout: This is led by the series creator, Denise Druce.  It had very few dancing moves (the Charleston mostly) and was mostly retro aerobics that ranged from low to high impact (gave you both options).  She cues much better than the other instructors but that isn't really saying much.  This routine got my heart rate up though you may have to properly cool yourself down before the stretches.

Belly Dance For Beginners: This is led by a thin blonde who seemed to know very little about belly-dancing.  She never talked about isolating the right muscles or cued her movements properly.  The music also would've been more suited for a yoga or tai chi workout (which may have been a better addition).  Since I didn't feel like I got an adequate workout, I chucked this in the trash and took away another star.

Time: Each DVD is a little over half an hour including the warm-ups and cool-downs which is perfect for my currently packed schedule.

Target Audience: People with busy schedules, People who can catch on to choreography in decent time and maybe people who went to Denise's gym (She & Company) and needed a substitute workout for when they couldn't make it.

All and all, despite minor setbacks I found three out of four DVDs enjoyable and think that it doesn't deserve only one star.",1334707200,8,2753,4.576687116564417
8450672,1,B005052ZU8,"This DVD was a joke.  The pictures on the front and back are not of the ""dancers"" in the video.  I never broke a sweat and I danced better than the dancers teaching.  I was a belly dancer in college, and it was obvious that the woman teaching had never so much as taken a class.  Absolute joke:  waste of money.  I'll do better research next time.",1334016000,,347,4.104477611940299
8450673,1,B005052ZU8,"The worst workout DVD ever! It looks like it was filmed in someone's garage. They must have spent 99% of their entire budget on the DVD jacket design and spent what little they had left on amateurs to pretend they knew what they were talking about. I bought this DVD at Target and I've learned my lesson. Never again will I purchase a workout DVD without doing some research on it's quality first. If you buy this DVD, you might as well be burning your cash. Frankly, that might be more fun than trying to workout to this DVD.",1331337600,,526,4.3232323232323235
