8350725,5,B0000541V4,Aright! If you have seen the second OVA I know for a fact that you'll love the third one. And for first time newbies to the anime Fushigi Yugi all I have to say is get the first one first. But for all the other people who have already seen some of it i have to say some thing. Tasuki and Miaka look more right together then Miaka and Tamahome but don't kill me!!!!!,1046044800,,365,3.945945945945946
8350726,5,B0000541V4,"The obvious best of the three-part Fushigi Yuugi OAV. Or perhaps this is because i am such an incredible lover of Tasuki and Chichiri? You can live without OAV 1 and still get by easily enough (unless you love the twins and Nakago, cuz 1's the one where they star). However, OAV 2 is pretty much required to make any sense whatsoever out of OAV 3. The art is incredible as Fushigi Yuugi always is, and the sound quality is excellent. The music is WONDERFUL; my two absolute favorite songs in the ENTIRE world are on this OAV. I actually fall into a state of silence whenever I hear them. It scares the crap out of my friends... me. Silent. *gasp* This is a MUST HAVE for Tasuki and Chichiri fans, as both have their focus episode on this tape. (note: if you're a Tasuki/Miaka hater, and you really, REALLY know Tasuki's personality, you won't be disappointed. If you actually *like* Tasuki/Miaka... then... you don't know Tasuki, so you won't get it, and you won't be disappointed! So everyone's happy. and NO, i didn't give anything away in the plot by saying that, trust me)  oh, and If you like Taka, get this tape. I mean it.  I suggest it to all! *especially* Tasuki and/or Chichiri fans! You will not survive long without this tape!!",982627200,,1239,4.502222222222223
8350727,4,B0000541V4,"I'll try not to give too much away with this review. This is the finale to a wonderful, if extremely dark at times, series. The cast has had a hard time fighting their nemesis, having lost a few of Tamahome's precious memories. The ""Universe of the Four Gods"" will finally be closed for good with hope finally reborn for Miaka and her friends. I saw this originally as a fansub and the professional version has not dimmed my feelings for the series (as can sometimes happen--Sailor Moon s and SS under Cloverway as an example.) The video and sound is quite good. I had no problems watching it, though it once again gets dark at the end. It is that darkness that forces me to make this rated at 4 stars, even though there is something like a happy ending for all involved in this final tale from an ancient Chinese book.",981763200,3,819,4.394736842105263
