8312548,4,B001JAHPS0,"This 1982-83 Season of this police drama was a so-so season, since CHiPs took a real nose-dive leaving us mourning the loss of Jon which resulted in this being the season when this cop drama went downhill, mostly due to the fact that this was the season when Ponch's original partner Jon Baker(Larry Wilcox) left the show and got replaced by rookie hot-dog motor-Officer Bobby Nelson(Tom Reilly)as Ponch's new partner since Wilcox left the show in the Spring of 1982 since Wilcox didn't get along too well with Estrada behind the set.

In addition to that, CHiPs 6th Season is when CHP Officers Bonnie Clark(Randi Oakes), Barry Baricza(Brodie Greer), and Jeb Turner(Michael Dorn) depart from the show and get replaced by new co-stars former Dallas Cowboys cheerleader(Tina Gayle)as CHP motor Officer Kathy Linahan; Clarence Gilyard, Jr. as California Highway Patrol Officer Benjamin Webster; and Bruce Penhall as Bobby Nelson's baby brother(Bruce Nelson) who join recurring co-stars Robert Pine as the cynical Sgt. Joe Getraer, Paul Linke as the eager Officer Arthur Grossman, and Lou Wagner as the petite CHP mechanic(Harlan Arliss) at CHP Central Division in L.A. underneath the Santa Monica Freeway.

In fact, this makes another perfect example on how and why this police drama couldn't succeed without BOTH Ponch(Erik Estrada) and Jon(Larry Wilcox) and how virtually inseperable they were, since the ratings tanked when the Jon Baker wannabe(Bobby Nelson)became Ponch's new partner.

Another example on why CHiPs couldn't succeed without BOTH Ponch & Jon, the ratings had previously slumped in the previous season(the 5th Season) when famous athlete(Bruce Jenner)briefly joined the cast & crew as Jon's interim partner(Officer Steve McLeisch) for 3 episodes when Erik Estrada(Ponch) left the show temporarily in the mid Fall of 1981, due to a salary dispute which therefore inclined the producers to bring Ponch back to the show permanently as Jon's partner since the ratings started sinking to a near all-time low which therefore prompted them to bring Ponch back to CHiPs in order to save the show from getting ousted along with the bad economy we had going on back then from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Reagan was president.

In addition to that, not only was there a lot of friction and rivalry between Erik Estrada and Larry Wilcox off the set during the first 5 seasons of this police drama which led to Wilcox's departure in the Spring of 1982, but then Estrada also ended up having a fall-out with Tom Reilly too since Estrada didn't like Reilly's work ethic after Reilly was arrested for drug possession by the LAPD in real life in the Winter of 1983, which was of course a double-whammy for Estrada which therefore resulted in Bobby being replaced by Bobby's kid brother(Bruce Penhall)in the Spring of 1983 as Ponch's new partner in the last 3 episodes of CHiPs before its cancellation in the Summer of 1983.

Something else that helped lead to this shows cancellation was CHiPs started losing a lot of viewers from the police drama T.J. HOOKER after its premiere on ABC in the Spring of 1982, especially when Jon left this show which brought the ratings on CHiPs to an all-time low while the ratings on TJ HOOKER were still at an all-time high along with the fact that TJ HOOKER was a more popular and more realistic cop show than CHiPs ever was.

Something else that baffled me about the Sixth Season of CHiPs was Ponch(Erik Estrada) was Mary-6 and Bobby(Tom Reilly)was Mary-7, but in the first 5 seasons of CHiPs, Ponch was Mary-4 and Jon was Mary-3.

Therefore, Ponch should've either stayed as Mary-4 and/or perhaps made Bobby become the new Mary-3 with Bobby's predecessor(Jon) out of the picture, but I guess the producers wanted to keep it simpler by having only 1 number apart from one another, since Ponch was Jon's partner in the first 5 years of this cop drama and then became Bobby's partner in the last season which was also the weakest season of them all throughout CHiPs whole 6-year run on NBC.

Unfortunately Larry Wilcox left the show after CHiPs Fifth Season run on NBC since Wilcox felt that Estrada was getting the Rolls Royce of treatment from the producers on the set.

This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CHiPs was on NBC every Sunday night at 8PM too.

This is also the season when Ponch gets his brand spankin new blue '82 Pontiac Trans Am and no longer has his old brown Firebird anymore, which was a major upgrade for Ponch.

In fact, Ponch's '82 Trans Am was just like the Knight 2000 was on KNIGHT RIDER, since Ponch's Trans Am was the same exact year, make, model, and body style as KNIGHT RIDER with the exception of all the sprucing and modifications that KNIGHT RIDER had that Ponch's Trans-Am didn't have.

It's just too bad that Ponch couldn't have traded in his brown Firebird for his '82 Trans Am in the 5th Season when Jon was still his partner, since Ponch's new Trans Am would've been a coll comparison to Jon's blue 4X4 GMC stepside pick-up that Jon had from Season 2 thru Season 5, since Jon's pick up had outclassed Ponch's Firebird big time, but at least Ponch's '82 Trans-Am would've had some better and interesting competition to Jon's GMC pick up.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Donny Most in the ""Rock Devil Rock"" episode during his co-starring days on HAPPY DAYS

*Bobby Beronsini's orangutangs(Poppy)in the ""Country Action"" episode

*Adam Rich in the ""Fallout"" episode after his co-starring days on EIGHT IS ENOUGH and the short-lived series CODE RED

*Natalie Shaffer in the ""Journey To A Spacecraft"" episode after her co-starring days on GILLIGANS ISLAND

*Rhonda Shear in the ""This Years Riot"" episode before her hosting days on USA UP ALL NIGHT

It was also interesting seeing cameo appearances done by

*Stu Nahan in the ""Something Special"" episode

*Country Western musician Johnny Lee singing his big hit song ""Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up To Be Cowboys"" in the ""Country Action"" episode

Unfortunately Erik Estrada's showbiz career tanked when CHiPs was axed in July of 1983.

I also used to watch this police drama in reruns on MeTV, TNT, and TBS too.",1229558400,7,7233,4.912151067323481
