3902653,5,B002C2KAZE,"Krod here didn't do well in the ratings. I don't know if it was the critics, the time slot... the wrong people watching... what? All I know is I laughed so hard watching this show it usually made my ribs hurt a bit. I'm an old D&D buff and I felt like the writers must have been too. Too many of the jokes were perfectly aimed at D&D cliche's that I don't think non-players would get. Or at least not get fully. The actor's were funny- oddly enough, the ""bad guy"" had the best screen presence and I ended up liking him the most.

It's a quirky comedy to be sure- and aimed at a specific group- but it's a lot of fun and at this price, it's truly worth it.",1270512000,,655,4.0
3902654,5,B002C2KAZE,"6 episodes just aren't enough! I heard rumors there were 6 more episodes already made that never aired... I'd love to see those as well! Either way, I'm fully happy the DVD's are finally available. Not much to be said about the show as it's already been said. Awesome show, best described as Lord Of The Rings meets Naked Gun! Us Americans finally get to see the unedited BBC versions of the show with Michael Gambon (who plays Dumbledore in the Harry Potter movies) narrating.",1270166400,5,477,4.623529411764705
3902655,5,B002C2KAZE,"Krod Mandoon is a series that brings together Monty Python, The Princess Bride, and a modern element that goes just a little farther.  The show is one of the best ever, in large part because of Matt Lucas' Dungalore.  The character is hilariously portrayed and even the smallest things seem hilarious in his delivery.  It is worthy of six stars IMO.

The show was canceled before it's time and I hope that DVD sales can bring it back ala Family Guy!  It deserves it.",1269993600,,466,4.5
3902656,4,B002C2KAZE,"With the popularity of shows such as ""Xena"", ""Legend of the Seeker"", ""Merlin"" and movies such as the ""Lord of the Rings"", what if there was a comedy version based on those type of shows?

Well, a British/American comedy titled ""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire"" was created by Peter A. Knight and mature humor inspired by ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", ""Get Smart"" and ""The Simpsons"".

The name which is is derived from a nickname of a kid that was picked on back in Peter's childhood (the name backwards is ""dork""), ""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and the Flaming Sword"" is filmed in Budapest and six episodes were aired on Comedy Central and now the uncensored BBC version is featured on DVD and will be released on March 23rd.

""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and The Flaming Sword of Fire: Special BBC Edition"" contains the first five episodes of the TV series extended and uncensored.  It's important to note that the second episode ""Golden Powers"" is combined with the first episode, thus the first episode on the DVD is 54 minutes instead of 28 minutes.

Here is a brief synopsis of each episode:

  * EPISODE 1 - Wench Trouble - Kr&ouml;d and friends try to save General Arcadius, his mentor and leader of the resistance against the evil Xanusian Empire.  Krod learns from Arcadius that he is ""The Golden One"".
  * EPISODE 2 - Our Bounties, Ourselves - Chancellor Dongalor puts up a bounty on Kr&ouml;d and his gang's heads.  Thus the group must fend off bounty hunters.
  * EPISODE 3 - O Biclops, Where Are Thou? Kr&ouml;d is nominated to an Elite Resistance Council but he first must get a precious gem away from a deadly cyclops.
  * EPISODE 4 - Succubi: The Dawn's Early Light - Kr&ouml;d is given a mission by Ralph's warlock Grimshank to light a beacon that will alert resistance leaders that Dongalor is planning to activate the eye.
  * EPISODE 5 - The Thrilla in the Villa - Kr&ouml;d and the gang sneak into Ralph's palace when they think Grimshank is working for Dongalor.  Meanwhile, Dongalor plans to unleash the Eye of Gulma Grymna.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and The Flaming Sword of Fire: Special BBC Edition"" is a hilarious series and contains the sexual humor that you would expect from a Comedy Central driven series.

Granted, the humor of the series will be a positive and negative depending on the viewer.  For those who love TV series such as ""Merlin"", ""Legend of the Seeker"" or ""Xena"" and those who enjoy the dramatic elements and action sequences as well,  may not find those deep moments in ""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and The Flaming Sword of Fire: Special BBC Edition"".  Especially as the main dramatic element is probably Kr&ouml;d worried about how many men Aneka has slept with, her sexual tactics and how many cartwheels she does while not wearing underwear.  But the series manages to have some fun during the action sequences as the gang of freedom fighters are often in danger's way.

There is plenty of humor but to some, the gags may seem offensive to some.  There is a controversy with the character of Bruce as the gay community found the flamboyant gay character as offensive.  Series creator Sean Maguire said the producers expected a backlash when it comes to a stereotypical character.  So, it depends on the viewer and how sensitive they are to the jokes.

Overall, ""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and The Flaming Sword of Fire"" is a naughty and humorous series.

It's quite interesting to have a fantasy series with the main character to be quite inept and the majority of the gang being useless to near idiotic but somehow they manage to get the job done.  In someway, one can see the inspiration from a series such as ""Get Smart"" and ""Monty Python's Holy Grail"" in this series.  But what it all comes down to is one's sense of humor.

For those wondering about the sexual part of the series, there is no nudity or any obscene language in this television series but there is simulated sex featured especially in the fourth episode of this DVD.  If anything, the series definitely utilizes the beautiful India de Beaufort throughout the series.  Her character of Aneka is a sexual pagan who loves sex and uses it as a weapon.  Despite her love for Kr&ouml;d, it's part of her nature and her tradition.  And thus the sexual humor in the series.  So, probably not a series you want to watch around the children.

Personally, I found ""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and The Flaming Sword of Fire"" to be a fun, humorous series that never gets too serious.  And for me, it was good to see something this crazy and different for a change for Comedy Central.

I don't know where the future is for ""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and The Flaming Sword of Fire"" or if there will be any more episodes but for the most part, if you enjoy fantasy adventure series and mature humor, definitely give ""Kr&ouml;d Mandoon and The Flaming Sword of Fire: Special BBC Edition"" a chance!",1269907200,28,6257,4.769804287045666
3902657,5,B002C2KAZE,"Very few people are aware of this hilarious series. It mixes all types of humor so it has a little something for everyone. The episodes get funnier as you go through them and you begin to expect the unexpected because none of the story line makes any sense. That is the actual beauty behind the series. You have a sorcerer that cannot cast magic, a leader that is a complete moron, a female companion that uses sex as a weapon in her arsenal although she is dating the leader, a half pig/half man that is as dumb as a door nail and a homosexual guy that just does things that are completely ridiculous to be flamboyant. The mixture will give you many laughs and you will wonder after the last episode why comedy central cancelled the series.",1269734400,10,741,4.416058394160584

Great writing in the spirit of the web-comic ""The Order of the Stick"" (OOTS).  Stellar cast and acting.

3902725,4,B002C2KAZE,"Short-lived as it was, I thoroughly enjoyed this show and the way it spoofed the stereotypical roles of hero dramas.  It had everything:
* A hero with mediocre fighting skills and the emotional development of a tweener girl who can't get a monagamous relationship established with his hottie fellow adventurer
* The strong, sexually promiscuous warrior - best in the group - who will seduce enemies as readily as fight them
* A simple-minded humanoid with little impulse control or thought of consequence
* A mage who can't actually work magic, but constantly brags himself up
* A socially inept, egomaniacal villain oblivious to anything but his vanity
* Monsters and encounters that skewer the expected scenarios and play out in very questionable ways (A bi-clops?)

There are frequent sexual innuendos and play on words, but these should fly right past kids; no nudity or cursing, though the Racoon Festival might be questionable viewing for some people.

If you saw ""Your Highness"" and were disappointed as I was because it had potential and simply turned out to be a crap movie, Krod Mandoon is everything you wanted to see.",1388016000,,1129,4.962962962962963
3902726,1,B002C2KAZE,"I was shocked to see in a search results listing this DVD because, well quite frankly I couldn't believe someone would actually spend the money to release this on DVD.

But I guess it has it's fans, I guess.",1370476800,,344,4.476190476190476
3902727,5,B002C2KAZE,"The best afternoon you can spend with good friends, snacks and caffeine. Krod is, dare I say it, a masterful work of satire, parody and straight, twisted fun. Charismatic leads with acting chops to turn a borderline joke good. Supporting cast who all get time in the spotlight and drink up every photon.

This is a geek love-letter to those followers of Hercules and Xena (I wasn't, but still) along with a slew of other fantasy almost rans (oops! I guess with one season, Krod is among those).

Nonetheless, one to own. You owe yourself the hearty belly laughs (if you can, find a preview of at least the first episode, though... this humor isn't for everyone).

I'd seen several episodes when it originally aired and forgot the name of it until it was featured on Xbox Live one weekend. As soon as I saw it and had the name, I was at my computer ordering it from Amazon (glad that it was available). This is one that will stick with you and could supply quotable inside jokes with your friends for years.

If Monty Python's Holy Grail, The Princess Bride, and Lord of the Rings had an unholy, red-headed foster child, Krod would be it.",1363910400,2,1137,4.504854368932039

3902749,5,B002C2KAZE,"I have to say I'm a little bias here. The creators and writers have the same type of humor that I have. That's because they're also fans of the Monty Python and Mel Brooks series. I love witty and insane comedy that's not too vulgar full of sarcasm, etc. This wonderful series is all of that and more. Every episode I was laughing so hard I think I teared. At other parts I needed to stop my DVR because I was laughing so hard. When your funny...like really funny...you don't need to hurt yourself or curse to make people laugh. Such a mistake not renewing this series. Worth every penny!",1361404800,,588,4.3545454545454545

3902751,5,B002C2KAZE,"Combine action, adventure, and fantasy with excellent writing, an extraordinary villain, and sexual innuendo and you've found Krod Mandoon and his Flaming Sword of Fire.

Krod (which is Dork spelled backwards) is destined to perform brave deeds in the defense of his homeland.  With an ineffectual band of freedom fighters, and a sword that almost randomly bursts into flame, Krod must stop the evil Chancellor Dongalor from using the deadly Eye of Gulga Grymna.

Krod's band of misfits bring a very sophisticated dialog to life with abundant humor and absurd premises.  The writing is as good as MASH, the acting as good as the Princess Bride, and the situations as crazy as Monte Python.

Krod Mandoon is produced in five episodes.  Try to watch just one and you will get sucked into watching the next, then another, and suddenly you've finished the entire story...and want to watch it again.  Every time I watch it I find even more humor than before.

An effort by Comedy Central and the BBC, this ""special BBC edition"" is uncensored and includes extended episodes.  As the British would say ""This is quite naughty.""",1345507200,,1119,4.909574468085107
3902752,3,B002C2KAZE,"Krod, a reluctant hero with no self-esteem finds himself teamed up with a pagan warrior who uses her sexuality more than her sword to conquer foes.  Krod sees her as his girlfriend, although she definitely views their relationship as more of an ""open"" on than a monogamous one.  Zezelryck, played superbly by Kevin Hart, is a master of deception in that his sorcerer skills are essentially non-existent, yet he manages to convince almost everyone he's the second coming of Merlin.  Bruce, the bereaved widow of Krod's mentor is a fashion extravaganza unto himself and absolutely hilarious in his assessment of various situations the group finds themselves in.  Chancellor Dongalor is the best villian to grace the screen in a long time.  The only comparison I can think of is Dr. Evil, though Dongalor makes Dr. Evil look like a genius.

We absolutely loved this show when it aired.  I'm a fan of ""intellectual"" comedy too, but sometimes it's nice to just laugh at something without having to involve too much brain power if you know what I mean.  The humor here is borderline low-brow and almost always over the top.  The actors play their parts perfectly, and the interactions between the main characters couldn't be done and better.
The DVD however seems to have some issues, the main one being the closed captioning.  No matter how many times you turn it off in the main menu, it will not disable.  Trying to watch the show with the captioning on is very distracting and has really hampered our enjoyment of it.

The show is a sword and sorcery comedy. Krod Mandoon controls a flaming sword and is trying to take down the evil villain, Chancellor Dongalor. Krod has a band of misfits with him that help him with this quest. They include Aneka (A pagan nympho played by the beautiful India de Beaufort), Bruce (a flaming something else), Loquasto (an oaf pig-like man), and Zezelryck (a sorcerer with very limited power).

The comedy factor is obvious in the series. Early on you see the band fight some thugs. During the fight, you see Aneka pay one of them off with sex, and Zezelryck shoots Krod accidentally with a cross-bow). Krod and Aneka have a love connection but Krod is not OK with her pagan like ways. In the second episode, the Raccoon festival takes place. This is a pagan ritual that involves Aneka having sex with 300 guys after a very sexy strip tease.

The series gave me a lot of laughs. If you are fan of comic parodies, you will like this show. I have watched the series through twice now and I did appreciate the film a lot more the second time through. It's not one to be taken seriously.",1289260800,,1352,4.421686746987952

3902782,5,B002C2KAZE,"This short lived comedy series is a lost treasure. i cant understand for the life of me why. every episode is full of laughs. the cast of characters is fantastic. its an odd group of people for sure, and it works. the story never really feels too serious, which is good as to not detract from the fun of the show. unlike all the spoofy garbage comedy seen in the movies, this show is totally genius. though apparrently widely misunderstood. the show actually has characters that seem like they could exist, insecure and disfunctional as they may be. things actually happen in the story and the chain of events come together pretty well.

i think acceptance of the show comes from embracing the characters and there shortfalls; understanding who they are and why they are so rediculous. krod- brave hero type who is totally insecure. zezlryk(spelling?)-My favorite.- a worlock who pretends he can do magic. he also runs his mouth like chris tucker from rush hour...trust me, it works. aneka- sexy lady warrior chick who screws anything she must to get what she needs. bruce- a gay dude who says and does gay stuff. his appeal is hit or miss, his character is a little odd, even for this group. i like him though. and fat oafish pigman guy(still cant remember his name)- a dimwitted pigman who cant aim his crossbow, or think. but his nose for food can detect what humans cant. AND the nemesis and his right hand man Dongalor and Barnabus- dongalor is so non threatening for a bad guy its funny, and such a creep of a human being, all the while, being oblivious to the fact. classic. barnabus is wholey devoted to his leader despite all the mistreatment and abuse hes put through.

in there own way these characters come together in a hilarious way that could have been made even better if the series had more episodes to show of these crazy characters in interesting scenarios. at least, with only six episodes, the show ends fresh and interesting.

3902787,3,B002C2KAZE,"Special BBC Edition DVD - 5 Episodes on 1 Widescreen Disc (2010)

""Krod Mandoon"" and the Flaming Sword of Fire"" is a co-production of Comedy Central, Media Rights Capital and BBC Television. The series was created by Peter A. Knight, directed by Alex Hardcastle, and written and produced by Knight and Brad Johnson. You might recognize the voice of Albus Dumbledore as Michael Gambon is the narrator. Krod Mandoon and his band of warriors is the only hope against the wicked Chancellor Dongalor in this comedic fantasy series. They must overcome evil obstacles like insults, assassins, their own BS and a bisexual Cyclops.

The tone of the series feels very much like a modern Monty Python mixed with a fantasy series like a recent series I acquired but am still working my way through ""Legend of the Seeker."" If you've seen a ""Hercules"" or ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" series and also like British Monty Python absurdest humor with lots of sexual comedy, you'd probably enjoy this mash-up. There were really only a few moments out of the five episodes that really made me laugh out loud a bit, the other moments mostly just got a smile out of me. If you enjoy the series, it would have considerable re-watch value and I think the jokes would get funnier over time. The tone feels inconsistent and some characters are more annoying than others, but overall it has a lot of humor.

Sean Maguire heads up the cast as Krod Mandoon, a freedom fighter with a lack of confidence and destiny involving the aptly named flaming sword. Maguire played Leonidas in the comic spoof ""Meet the Spartans"" and his handsome face and charisma do well to lead this group. It is odd to have such a doubtful leader and a lot of times it really is like he is the adult trying to manage a bunch of snickering children in his band of warriors laughing at fart jokes.

Matt Lucas is a very funny villain as Chancellor Dongalor that looks like Dr. Evil in medieval garb but sounds like every Monty Python villain you ever saw with his range of going up and down with his voice for the jokes. You might remember seeing him recently as Tweedledee and Tweedledum in ""Alice in Wonderland"" or in the series ""Little Britain"" where most of his work is. His facial expressions and line delivery are the funniest of the whole crew and his childish ways really sell the immaturity of the character. His opening scene he begins by judging a singer much in the style of Simon Cowell and then riding through the narrow hallways of his castle hallways on a horse.

Aneka is played by India de Beaufort who is beautiful and a fabulous dancer with a pretty attractive English accent. Somehow she also is the most emotional character in spite of being very free of her sexuality as a pagan maiden and using it as a weapon (or just whenever she feels like it). The comedy works much better when she is snickering with the others in the band of freedom fighters.

Zezelryck is a warlock who is better at making up excuses and spells than actual wizardry played by Kevin Hart. It reminds me of Dave Chappelle back in ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (whose jokes hit or miss depending on the situation in that movie). Krod's half human/half swine, Loquasto is played by Steve Speirs and is just big slow sidekick to round out the group that feels a little annoying and unessential. Lastly, the fierce and flamboyant, Bruce joins the group within the first episode to lay out the excuse for all sorts of gay jokes and reactions.

Thank goodness for the cameo of John Rhys-Davies as Grimshank, another Warlock-type for Zezelryck to get jealous of. His booming voice giving exposition for the plot to actual move along really helps a story develop instead of just a running commentary on the character types. His inclusion really gave legitimacy to this series as did Michael Gambon's voice. When you strip away those two and Matt Lucas, it is mostly a bunch of sexuality jokes with a thin plot.

On the second viewing, a lot more jokes worked, especially from Matt Lucas. This is worth picking up if you like anything about this genre plus really silly British comedy.

DVD Extras:

There is a sequence called ""Behind the Scenes with Kevin Hart"" where he basically jumps around everywhere and talks about the movie and tries to get funny candid moments out of the cast. The ""Cast Interviews"" sequence was very helpful in getting some background on the origins of how the story came about and the tone as well as the cast giving feedback on their characters. The ""Outtakes"" sequence is full of bloopers which are silly.

The ""Deleted & Extended Scenes"" starts with an alternate opening sequence features more narration and less fancy fire and graphics. It focuses mostly on horse riding and the correct spelling of Krod's name. I actually enjoyed their getting lost sequence more than the original opening with them just arriving at a tavern since it introduces all the characters a bit more thoroughly before they get into the story. The deleted scenes are mostly extra bits for Matt Lucas' character to establish more of his mood swings. The extended scenes mostly remark more on the free sexuality of Aneka to further ram the point home so to speak.",1270944000,,5193,4.683114035087719
