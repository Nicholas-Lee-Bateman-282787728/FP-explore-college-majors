3877718,1,B0029O0ANW,thomas jane rules.  the crazy chick from happiness rules.  bad writing/directing/editing makes this show the opposite of rules.,1260748800,9,127,6.0
3877719,4,B0029O0ANW,"At first blush, ""Hung"" seems like just a sex comedy, and on that level it works fine.  But at its core it's related to men's work and how they identify with the jobs they do.  In that respect ""Hung"" is like ""The Full Monty"": it shows how vulnerable men are to the erosion (or elimination) of their role as providers and earners.

Love Thomas Jane's voiceovers: may be the single funniest element in the whole show!",1254441600,3,414,4.421052631578948
3877720,4,B0029O0ANW,"Wasn't sure what to expect from this besides the obvious.  It seemed in the beginning that there was a lot to balance between the facade of the student admired, all around good guy of Coach Ray Drecker and his cocky and at times infantile alter ego.  Then you have hot mess, wanna be pimp Tonya who seems likes she's one bad hair day away from workplace homicide.  But in the end, it all somehow works and entices you to want to watch more.  (It doesn't hurt Thomas Jane isn't afraid to show his bum off alot!)  It was HBO's most watched freshmen show ever so I hope that means a 2nd season and beyond will be secured because watching these characters come into their own will be entertaining!",1253318400,24,693,4.3828125
3877721,4,B0029O0ANW,"This show did not last very long and I can understand why. It was mainly hampered by having one central idea from which it never deviated. If we were going to have one idea to follow that long, I needed one that was more than Thomas Jane becoming a male prostitute in order to supplement his income as a divorced teacher.

But the initial episodes are interesting enough. Indeed, this entire first season covers the whole idea and one could be perfectly satisfied with just it. He is extraordinarily well endowed (thus the name ""Hung"") which makes this sideline a natural for him. Besides that, he is very good looking and charming. Actually, this guy could get remarried so easily to a woman in his age range (40s) with a lot of money that I wondered why in the heck he didn't go that route since he was bound and determined to prostitute himself for money.

Perhaps the best part of the show though is that he is surprised to discover that women don't want any more from him than what he has on offer. He figures that unlike a female prostitute, they may actually have feelings for him. Think again. He has the exact same problem in this department that a woman does.

He also has an interesting female pimp.

His ex is remarried to a wealthy guy who has zilch other qualities. The kids are ok. That part of the show could have been eliminated without a problem.

I've never talked to any men who watched this, only women. But maybe there are guys out there who enjoyed this who simply haven't come forward. I think it was intended for a female audience though. Try it. You might like it or at least one season of it.",1253232000,,1619,4.40133779264214
3877722,5,B0029O0ANW,"Hung started about the same time as True Blood season two. After the second episode I was hooked! The main character is a high school history teacher and basketball coach whose house burns down, children want to live with his ex-wife and he's broke broke broke. He meets up with a poet who he once (ahem) and together they hatch a harebrained scheme to pimp him and his ... out. Through this he has to deal with women he isn't attracted to but learns to love what's under the skin, crazy women who pay for him but not his ""services"" and the working in's and out's of women. Meanwhile his pimp, Tanya, is suffering as a failed poet and drowning in her own lack of love in her life. Bumps and bruises along the way but every episode bring  laughter and smiles to my face (and my husbands!).
The characters learn and even though they get a lot more bad than good cards, they always grow. I'm very pleased with the direction this new series is going and sit in anticipation every Sunday night when my little red dot that indicates my DVR is recording blinks on. Hung is a lot more than I had anticipated and am tickled with the gem found under dirty gym socks and a slathering of sexual innuendo.",1250467200,101,1192,4.345291479820628
3877723,1,B0029O0ANW,"Watched this a while back.  Thought it was cute at the time.  Then upon thinking about it more, this is a really bad cable TV series.  Lame.  Jane's acting leaves a lot to be desired.  Subject matter is silly.  Purely for the entertainment of a sub-simple-minded person.  I can't pin it down, but HBO has gone steadily downhill.  Except for Curb your Enthusiasm I can't find a series that holds my interest.  I find it hard to watch any HBO series on Amazon Prime, and would never consider subscribing to HBO.",1510790400,,509,4.5054945054945055

I couldn't watch more than one episode but I am sure it will appeal to some folks, not for me.",1498176000,,306,3.935483870967742
3877733,5,B0029O0ANW,"I started watching this on Amazon Prime and am now purchasing the DVD's.  This show is great! Thomas Jane is wonderful in this role, very convincing and doesn't appear to view himself as God's gift to women even though he's very sexy! I read other reviews and am amazed that some people found this series offensive. Get a clue from the title and don't watch if that kind of programming offends you. The program is a little racy and certainly not for everyone, but it is well written ( in my opinion) and well done and the acting is great. Thomas Jane and the actress who portrays his pimp do a great job of making the characters likeable..... you can't help but root for them as they just try to make their lives a little better, but often get shot down. I did not care for the way the series ended and think it could have gone another season in order to have a more appropriate ending. All in all though, a very fun romp!",1496102400,3,922,4.268571428571429
3877734,4,B0029O0ANW,"I hadn't quite known what to expect from ""Hung"" when I had bought the first season. I was aware of actor Thomas Jane and his nice looking body from prior movies. He is hot with a great voice. This is a story of about 2 flawed individuals whose paths cross and their destinies become intertwined as they become pimp and whore. Each is trying to make it in the world, and each has a good heart. I could not help but root for these 2 as they face personal challenges and many roadblocks in their pursuit to provide for themselves in a chaotic world. Having Thomas Jane bare his nice ass periodically was a definite plus.",1494547200,,617,4.327586206896552

3877736,5,B0029O0ANW,A perfect guilty pleasure show. The excellent acting makes the premise believable and strangely compelling to watch.

I was surprised at how funny and tasteful the show is considering the storyline.  The characters are unique and unexpected, and giving Ray the day job of a coach and teacher is so relateable.

I patiently got through the first season, and then decided to check out the first episode of the second season to see if the problem was, like so many new shows, ""first season growing pains."" It was not - episode one of season two was even worse, so, if anything the show actually got worse with time, instead of better.

3878034,4,B0029O0ANW,"Hung is an interesting show. It takes a little while to find its legs and get moving, but once it does it clips along pretty well. It's not as much of a comedy as a dramedy, and I was expecting more funny than awkward moments. While there is a good mix of both funny and awkward, there are more 'feeling sorry' moments for the lead character, Thomas Jane's Ray and Jane Adams' Tanya than anything else.
Ray starts out a bit annoying but you quickly warm up to his character. Tanya starts out endearing and a bit awkwardly cute before becoming incredibly annoying. By season 2, I was rooting for Lenore to force Tanya out of the show which really is a shame.
Anne Heche's ex-wife character is extremely hard to watch, as her interactions with her children are nails-on-chalkboard levels of cringe worthy awkwardness. Ray's children, while played as background pieces in the first few episodes, really flesh out in later episodes. They showcase a perfect bi-section of the awkwardness of adolescence, finding yourself as a teen, experimentation and body image, while playing as a nice mirror to the adult characters finding themselves, experimentation, and dealing with body image. The show doesn't play up this dichotomy, but it's nice that it exists and is written into the narrative.

Like any other HBO show, the quality is top-notch and the nudity and language is prevalent. Not as much nudity as I expected, but just as much as you probably should expect in a show about a male prostitute. Don't watch around the kids. Or with your parents.",1475539200,2,1544,4.782771535580524

This is such a fun and compelling show.  I was hooked by the third episode, and I have to admit that it is primarily due to Jane Adams' performance: soooooo good.  And I was surprised by Thomas Jane's performance as well. This is a great show about life, really: what do you do when you lose it all (e.g. marriage, children, home, and eventually job...).

3878662,5,B0029O0ANW,"Warning: Many parents, most parents perhaps, will not want their kids to watch this series.

Though you never see the ""well hung"" part of the human anatomy after which this series is named, you do see full backside nudity on occasion, including in the title sequence of every episode.

That said, a person who is not easily offended by sexual innuendo might enjoy this series as much as I did. I binge watched all three seasons over a period of about a week. (Well, okay, not quite a binge, but it was my main viewing choice other than network TV that week.)

This series reverses the roles, we see a male teacher who becomes a gigolo in order to raise money to restore his family home that burned down in the first episode of the first season, and he gets into lots of antics along the way.

The series is not realistic. Schools don't fire teachers at the end of each school year so that they can rehire them the next year. Teachers with tenure do not get fired except for cause, and then they would not be rehired.

To me, the biggest problem is that in real life, a school teacher and a coach who had been with the same school for a number of years would not go unrecognized for over two seasons. (He is eventually recognized by one of his former students who is by that time, an adult, thus the ""years"" part of this sentence.

I really enjoyed this, but take this review with a grain of salt. Some people will not enjoy it nearly as much as I did, and other people will hate it.",1454630400,,1482,4.275

She is such a looser yet everyone caves to her and I don't see it.  Also, the math doesn't compute.  The lifestyle all 3 lead once they have a real promoter would mean he's fornicating 24/7 even at $600 a pop.

3878824,4,B0029O0ANW,Hung is a fun show with adult subject matter. Set in Detroit and does a pretty good job at setting a scene of  how hard it is for teachers in detroit which inspires one teacher with a special gift to find other means of making money. This leads to some very awkward situations and building of a strong protagonist. Good enough to keep my attention for a couple seasons.,1453334400,,369,4.3478260869565215
3878825,5,B0029O0ANW,"I really liked ""Hung"".I watched several episodes back to back which I seldom do because I usually can't sit still that long meaning nothing holds my attention that long. This show did. The main premise of the show is based on just what you think ""Hung"" means. It's a little sophomoric but introduces a whole lot of humor at the expense of the the pathetic main character who does a great job of playing the straight man when you know he must be cracking up inside. He is such a loser you can't help feel empathy for him.
  Great acting, great writing,and a novel way to present a comedy about the ""oldest profession"" . Looking forward to watching more.",1453248000,2,652,4.470588235294118

3879009,4,B0029O0ANW,"I came across Hung by accident and decided to watch it.. and before you knew it I had watched the entire season one and now have finished season two.

This is not a show for everyone..so if you are squeamish about sex, nudity and suggestive comments then don't even attempt to watch this, so with that said.. I will say that it is entertaining and you keep watching it because you want to see what in the world else can happen to the main characters.  And yes.. underneath it all... .. there is a plain old fashioned  love story going on.

Without going into detail... it is about a nice looking man that got divorce.. he is a a teacher (dont read beyond here if you don't want to read a bit of a spoiler)..

..he is about to lose his teaching job, and his home caught on fire so he has  spent a good amount of time living in a tent on his property while he tries to fix the house back up.  His kids are totally dysfunctional.. his ex- wife is almost dysfunctional and his partner in his new business is totally bizarre but in a nice way and very likeable. But what the show is about is.  he has decided to market the only true asset he has.. which is his body  and so becomes a somewhat comical male prostitute with a most unusual lady pimp...  all the episodes follow him along this journey and the women he encounters.

As I said earlier this is not a family show or a series for anyone that has difficulty with nudity and or sex in a show.. but yet.. I still found it to be quite entertaining and look forward to watching season 3.  The quality of the show is average... some of the parts  move a little slow.. but yet.. as I said earlier..

The story line in which one of his clients basically wants to use him to play the role of her ex, so that she can find some closure after what seems to have been a bad relationship is a good start, but it falls flat at some point.

3879229,4,B0029O0ANW,"HBO has tackled the motif of the oldest profession and that is prostitution.  But instead of a story centering around a woman being pimped by a man it is a man being pimped by a woman.  The star of this story is a good looking High School Basket Ball coach whose wife has left him with his two dorky kids, his team is on a loosing streak, and to top it off his house catches fire.  Now they ignore the fact that he apparently doesn't have any homeowners insurance and ends up sleeping in the backyard in a tent.  Add to this it is taking place in Dear-born Michigan.  Now the important thing on this is that apparently the producers are believing all the Global Warming crap because this starts during High School Basket ball season which occurs after Christmas and most people in Michigan at this time haven't seen the ground in 3 months for all the snow.  But despite this little unknown fact by them our protagonist teams up with a nerdy woman who is longer on her literary skills than her cosmetology talents and she creates a business model and begins trying to educate our hero on how to please a woman.  Now his main talent is the fact that he is supposedly hung like a horse which tells us that our wives have been lying when they say;""Size doesn't matter.""  Now we know the truth.  But there is more to the intercourse of Sex than having to strap your third leg to one of the others, he has to learn how to communicate with women, read what they say which is never what they mean, and then act accordingly.  As a man, being able to take a beautiful woman into the restaurant bathroom then banging the crap out of her until she is driven into carnal oblivion is cool, but that might not be exactly what she had in mind.  Knowing how to respond when she says;""I might be falling in love with you.""  Most men in his profession would use this occasion to to perform financial intercourse on the woman but he is a normal Heterosexual male who is only doing this to get the money to rebuild his house not to steal money from this woman.  The Script writing is good, the plots are reasonable despite that fact they know nothing of Dear-born Michigan.  I do find it funny and intriguing and I'm looking forward to the next episode.",1444435200,3,2232,4.346987951807229

3879322,3,B0029O0ANW,"This was an interesting idea for a series-and parts of it hit the mark-but other parts do not. I previously watched the series on DVD and I grew up near Detroit so there is some personal identification for me. The main character (Ray Drecker) is pretty much what you would expect-a high school athletic hero who was drafted by the Atlanta Braves, but his career was derailed by injury. He is back at his old high school teaching/coaching-he married the cheerleader-but is unhappily divorced from her and way down on his luck. He is handsome, appealing, easy going (and hung), but has limitations in his ability to relate to others-especially women. That is the real interesting part-as he becomes a small time male ho-he finds that this profession is much different for men than it is for women. He has to find a way to relate to his customers on their (female) terms or they are much less interested in his physical equipment. The series does a good job of exploring these avenues-(but many of the sideshow characters distract from that). The fiery redheaded, Lenore, is a passive-aggressive alpha manipulator. She reminds me of my ex-wives-except the actress that plays Lenore is stunningly beautiful. I fell in love with her-she is beautifully & emotionally treacherous and plays the part to alpha perfection. Tanya, the amateur pimp, has a good soul-but the character is too naive and emotional (and irritatingly skanky) to do the job she is trying to do. In real life Detroit she would be dead in about 5 minutes. But this was not real life Detroit either-it is much too white for that. The primary client in the first season (Jemma) is played very alluringly. She is setting up Ray to take an emotional fall-and he is completely outclassed (but she pays him well). The first season falls a just a little short of being great. I was looking forward to the second season-which was then uneven and too focused on the sideshow of irritating support characters.. The third season was far better and I think if the second season had been better built on the first----this show could have had a longer run. As a series it was at times erratic, boring, unrealistic, irritating. If you like to follow the the subplots you will probably find this interesting and enjoyable. If you are looking for a diet of (Cinemax) sex scenes-it likely won't be satisfactory-although there is a considerable amount of nudity.",1443225600,,2406,4.8

He finds that he has to sleep with women he's really not interested in. He has to learn to make women feel at ease. He is always trying to do what is right.

Juggling life with his children, a shallow ex-wife, the demands of teaching in an underfunded school, and trying to figure out the mysterious female mind makes for plenty of humor.  His ""pimp"" is also a character that you wind up pulling for, wishing that she could somehow cross the line to join the haves instead of being solidly rooted in the camp of has-nots.",1438992000,3,605,4.4324324324324325

3879838,3,B0029O0ANW,I am having a hard time (no pun intended) getting into this one. 4 episodes in and I am going to give one more a try. I think some viewers will enjoy the show as it is written well and the actors earn their spots but something just has not clicked for me on this one. 3 stars because of the last sentence otherwise it would only be a 2 star rating IMO,1437523200,,351,3.8219178082191783

3879840,5,B0029O0ANW,I found this show to be very funny. I certainly don't enjoy the language but find the characters interesting and off-beat. Thomas Jane portrays a character that just can't catch a break so he uses his talents to provide supplemental income. Jane Adams plays a character that wants desparately wants to succeed but doesn't have the skill set to make this business profitable. Rebecca Creskoff probably has the most fun with her character that is basically out for herself under all circumstances. She seems close to being a sociopath because she says and does whatever will get her what she wants. Gregg Henry is a teddy bear that wants and needs love. The interaction of these characters is what makes this a fun show to watch. You should be warned that some scenes are quite graphic. This is adult humor.,1437436800,,805,4.757142857142857

Looking forward to many Harvard graduate theses analyzing the humanistic aspects of this deeply moving and sensitive assessment of interpersonal relationships in the first world, and how this will impact humanity well into the 23rd century. May hold the keys to mankind's survival. That and a robust space program.  As has been said before, the dinosaurs went extinct due to their lack of a viable space program.

Went well with a glass of cold Tuscan Milk, exclusively available from Amazon.  Look it up, I suggest adding this libation to all automatic orders. A bit steep at today's milk prices but online milk purchasing is really the only way to go these days.  Often milk is sour, but a good source of variable microbiota.

I'm a bit unclear on the purpose of this review and its relation to reality and the TV show which I didn't view in its entirety or even in many linked pieces. I tried to look critically at the show but it made no sense and I kind of skipped around to get the highlights but even then I was confused. Keep getting asked to review it though by Amazon, so here it is. Hopefully now I'll be left alone to my Tuscan Milk. Cheers!",1435968000,3,1255,4.6863636363636365

It's ridiculous at times,  but without these scenes it would lack great humor.  I find that many fantastic shows start off a little slow and end up really delivering.  (Sopranos for example). They are only half hour shows.  It'll leave you wanting more & wondering why there are only 3 seasons.",1434585600,,577,4.673267326732673

3880317,4,B0029O0ANW,"This is not the kind of series I'd normally be interested in.  I was imagining a fusion of Sex and the City, Weeds, and Californication.  I hate those kind of shows because the characters are wish fullfillment fantasies of housewives and are as far from a guy's reality as you can get.  I didn't like the Lenore character.  She belongs on Sex and the City.  The series reminds me a little bit of The United States of Tara, which I kind of liked.  I think it's funny to watch an average nice guy having to put up with crazy women.

I didn't take the premise as seriously as I think others did.  You'll have to suspend your disbelief that all the women become instantly mesmerized after seeing his Johnson.  If it helps, you can do what I did and try to imagine that his Johnson is actually a magic wand with magical powers, or just think of what he's selling as the Blue Sh- from Breaking Bad.  Otherwise, you'll be stuck with nasty images in your head like Ron ""pap smear"" Jeremy..

I love the idea of an average guy with an athlete's understanding of women being paired with an borderline mentally unstable poet who acts as his 'pimp'.  The post game reports of all his failings are particularly funny.  The sex scenes are really pretty tame.  You don't even get to see his wang.  I binge watched the entire first season, which I never do.

3880345,5,B0029O0ANW,"""Hung Season 1"" is a drama-comedy genre television series, which follows high school teacher Ray Drecker's (Thomas Jane) unfortunate run of bad luck that ultimately results in him selling his services as a part-time male prostitute.

The at times erotic nature of the narrative is well complemented by characters who are believable, and in their own ways well-intended. The unstable U.S. economic climate of the late 2000s causes many of the characters anxiety, but this provides further substance to them and the story.

The interaction of primary characters such as Ray and his pimp Tanya Skagle (Jane Adams) provides numerous highly entertaining scenes as they both haphazardly learn the trade of heterosexual male prostitution.

Despite the plot containing sexual themes, notable story and character development takes place outside of the bedroom, which contributes to a pleasing first series.

3880360,3,B0029O0ANW,"So I just finished season 1 and can honestly say I won't be going any further with this show. Don't get me wrong. It's not bad, just awkward in a awkward kinda way. It's extremely slow, majority of the characters are pretty unlikeable, the show is pretty inconsistent and the biggest flaw(in my opinion) is the female lead, ""the poet"". Her acting is extremely awkward, annoying and stiff. Or maybe she's a really good actress and that's how her character is supposed to be played. Either way, I wasn't digging it.

I personally feel like this show didn't grab mine nor my girlfriends attention... And we watch ALOT of shows. I'm a guy and I loved Californication when it first came on. We recently bought season 1 of that show and she was dreading it cause she thought the show was only about sex only to find out its a pretty darn good show and we both love it. Same goes with Rescue Me(another great show).

The reason I compare both of those shows to this is they pretty much have the same premise; its about a guy, his broken family, the stuff they go through and let's not forget the sex. They're all similar in their own way only I feel Hung didn't quite meet my own I had gotten since watching the other two.

All in all, it's watchable once, but don't do what I did and buy the whole first season hoping to like it. I do this quite frequently(The Shield, The Sopranos, Sons of Anarchy, Breaking Bad. The list goes on) and love every show I get. The only dud was this and Dexter. And I'm not some biased old sexual prude either. I'm 23, have a very open sense of humor, and love all genres of movies and shows. With the exception of romantic stuff and sex in the city. Stuff like that I absolutely can not stand. So don't say I didn't give the show a chance or in get it. Hung just wasn't for me. I watched the first season in its entirety and at the end, just wasn't feeling it. It's a netflix kinda show if you wanna check it out. Hope my review was helpful.",1332892800,,1967,4.254010695187166

3880362,4,B0029O0ANW,"I've recently taken to watching shows that I've shunned in the past because I felt like they were a deliberate finger in the eye to people like me who don't approve of drug abuse, drug dealing, prostitution, and what could be generally described as ""people misbehaving.""

But having watched ""Weeds,""Breaking Bad,"" ""Secret Diary of a Call Girl,"" and having enjoyed them all (and now including all three seasons of ""Hung""), I've come to realize something...for the most part, ""good behavior"" is not cinematic.  People who lead ordinary decent lives are for the most part not terribly interesting as subjects of television dramas and movies.

So that's why I decided to give ""Hung"" a chance and while it will not be remembered by me decades from now as the greatest comedy-drama in cable television's history, I've enjoyed the series.

I think that's down to the leads of the series, the guy playing everyman Ray Drecker and the actress playing his hapless pimp Tanya make those characters sympathetic and plausible.  And the series manages to inject a fair amount of humor and absurdity in something that in real life is pretty sad and degrading.

And besides, all ""Hung"" is is a riff on one on the oldest and most successful tropes in literature...the hooker with a heart of gold...and it still works.

So if you don't mind a fair amount of lurid sexual encounters in a show (remember, it's a about a man-whore after all!), I think you will probably find ""Hung"" amusing and sometimes poignant.

It's not perfect...sometimes, the Tanya character comes across as such a mess, it's hard to see why her one and only ""ho"" would stay with her. Ann Heche's character (Ray's ex-wife) doesn't come across as terribly sympathetic (it's hard to see why Ray would pine after her).

But overall, it's good, escapist trash...and I'll be watching it when the fourth season rolls out.

Now, if only HBO would set up an agreement with Tivo so shows like this could be streamed to my TV instead of just to my computer.",1329091200,2,1999,4.784883720930233

His wife hates him and he has been told that the only thing that he is good for is that he is very well endowed. With the help of the most neurotic, incompetent, female ""pimp"" ever, Ray decides to become a male escort. This show is about the escapades that they go through day to day, and you will laugh hysterically during each episode as Ray tries to keep this part of his life private from the people who know him well. The women and characters that he comes across during his part time ""job"", will have you on the floor laughing. Highly recommend checking out this series.",1322352000,2,727,4.392592592592592

Though sounding laughable at first I found this series to be really all about the hard times in America and what lengths people will go to to survive and make it in this economy.

Jessica Haxon is Ray's ex-wife and married to a nervous and timid dermatologist. She's in the money now after giving up the dream she thought her life would be when she first married her high school sweetheart Coach Ray. She has neurotic episodes and is always trying to convince her two children Daman and Darby (whom she had by Coach Ray) to love her as any children would love their mom. But they just don't. The kids are great. The episodes are hysterical and everyone is made fun of and made to laugh at themselves.

Hung is a light and fun comedy for adults that plays around and pokes fun at the prostitution industry. Here we have two characters trying to make a million out of...",1316908800,20,1105,4.542713567839196

They seem to lack story ideas and repeat the same thing over and over--a struggling male prostitute trying to get by both financially while tending to his *social life*.
The costumes are atrocious. I've never seen actual people so fashionably challenged in real life. Then of course theres the aspect of the show where everyone is either drop dead gorgeous and can dress to a T..to the aesthetically challenged who seem to have some kind of problem putting basic things together. The A group is also brilliant while the b group is a couple fries short of a happy meal.
It's way too black and white and in your face for me.

3880381,4,B0029O0ANW,"I'll watch all of Deep Blue Sea just for Thomas Jane in a wetsuit, so it isn't too much of a hardship to watch him in Hung. It's actually nice to see an HBO series tackle the recession even if the protagonist is forced to sell his body to make ends meet. It sounded like an original storyline, it was available OnDemand, and once I got started, it keep me coming back to finish Season One in just a couple of days. I think Thomas Jane does a fantastic job with the role of Ray Drecker. He's likeable and even as he bumbles his way through his first few jobs, still very believable and endearing. Jane Adams as Tanya, Ray's pimp, drives me crazy. She's so sweet and naive, it's kind of excruciating watching her try to be a pimp - I just want to smack her and tell her to grow a backbone, so I'm actually looking forward to Lenore's expanding role and tough love approach. I'm hoping now that the writers have gotten their feet wet, there will be some more consistency and a lot more heat. I mean, come on, the show is on AFTER True Blood. I was expecting a little more erotic content.",1278115200,7,1084,4.216346153846154
3880382,5,B0029O0ANW,"Notice I said ""entertainment"" NOT ""art.""  Anyone who expects to find ""art"" in a cable television series needs to get their head examined.  Sure, the title and the storyline hinge upon the longstanding myth/reality (depending on which side of the fence you're on) that the better-endowed the man, the better a lover he is...but this is just an excuse for the movie, the ""hook"" if you will.  There are a lot of other layers to this series as well.  As far as mass entertainment goes, there is a refreshingly low percentage of cliches, stereotypes and stock characters...many scenes from ""Hung"" actually do contain a nice bit of originality and authenticity.

Excellent camera work and film editing, great music (especially the intro song by The Black Keys, ""I'll Be Your Man""), excellent cast (including a bevy of some FINE FINE babes in various states of undress, especially Alanna Ubach, Natalie Zea and Rebecca Creskoff), and strong dialogue all make this a pleasure to watch.  AND to top off all the eye candy, there's a fair bit of social realism and cultural satire happening too.  Jane Adams, Anne Heche, and of course Thomas Janes do most of the heavy lifting, and there is often a strong ""indie-film"" vibe to many of the scenes.  The viewer is not constantly being challenged to suspend disbelief, in other words.  The viewer does not feel manipulated or patronized or pandered to, which is exceedingly rare in most TV and cinema offerings these days.

I borrowed this DVD set from a friend and watched the entire thing on two successive evenings.  LOL, can you guess that I was hooked?  Highly recommended!",1277596800,9,1614,4.850364963503649

OK, lets get back to Hung. You basically have a poor school teacher that becomes a prostitute because he needs money. I love the idea but it's hardly original. We're starting to see a lot of these fish out of water type of shows. (Breaking bad-teacher becomes drug dealer)(Weeds-soccer mom becomes drug dealer) There's a reason these type of shows keep popping up. THEY WORK! It's always interesting watching someone completely out of there element. I love these types of shows. Hung has quickly become one of my favorites. It has a great cast, good writing, and a story that is pretty easy to follow. This show is also very funny. It's funny even when it's trying to be serious. I can't wait to see what they have in store for season two. There is still room for improvement. Hopefully, they will ditch the annoying ex-wife. Then, the show will be even better.

3880384,5,B0029O0ANW,"I first discovered Thomas Jane in the 1997 film ""Boogie Nights"" that dealt with the adult film industry. In that movie he plays a dancer and a hustler, a role that I am sure helped him in this TV series. In ""Hung"" Jane plays a basketball coach and a history teacher living in suburbian Detroit. Divored and financially strapped, things get even worse for Ray Drecker when his house catches fire and he cannot live there. Desperate for cash Ray delves into the world of escorting with the help of an old flame. The one asset that he possesses that many male escorts don't have is the large size of his penis, which is where the title of the series comes from. ""Hung"" deals with his various encounters with women, many of whom he is not attracted to, but ""meets"" them for sheer financial reasons. Jane does a superb job in playing the lead role and I would have to say he was made for it. He brings humor, intelligence, warmth, and likeliness, all ingredients that are important if you want the audience to like you, especially if your playing a male escort. Anne Heche has a supporting role as Ray's ex-wife in which they share custody of their teenage twin daughters. The first season was a huge ratings hit for HBO and in all ten episodes were filmed. A second season will air in the summer of 2010. Innovative, daring, and addictive are what makes ""Hung"" a must see TV event. This splendid DVD contains a featurette, audio commentary, and more and comes in widescreen format. The first season DVD set drops in stores June 22nd, 2010.",1267660800,4,1535,4.525179856115108
3880385,2,B0029O0ANW,"i have to say i found the conceit of this program repulsive. most women i know are not ""size queens"" and having a ""big fat one"" is no guarantee that ANY  real woman  would be cajoled into PAYING for the giant weenie fun ride. fictional characters notwithstanding, most women crave understanding, intimacy, and respect. 3 things you cannot find in a prostitute. (esp a male one)  i found this program sort of offensive on principle and tediously slow-paced and trying way too hard upon viewing. i can suspend my disbelief- but not as far as it requires me to insult my gender. you know-there ARE many ""female chauvinist pigs,"" too-- they cater to male notions of sexuality (in truth, men are far more obsessed w/ penis size than women) and flaunt them  in order to achieve status and success in a male -dominated world. this is why i am not surprised there was a ""woman writer/producer"" on board for this disaster. the divorced, down- on- his- luck dad with the heart -of -gold i wasn't buying either. i don't know-nothing rang ""true"" about this series. in order for dramas to be effective, you have to find something for the audience to connect to- and i'm afraid this ""female poet"" (ahem, ME) found nothing. i agree with another reviewer, thomas jane deserved better. this seemed like a sad attempt on HBO to compete with showtime's more tawdry fare. better luck next time cause i'm pretty sure this didn't get renewed.",1263513600,16,1420,4.690763052208835
