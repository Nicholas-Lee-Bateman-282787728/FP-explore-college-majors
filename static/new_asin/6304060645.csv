770330,2,6304060645,"...my sister found this movie from a friend.  She had rented it and told her it was bad.  Bad as in the footage.  My sister saw it, said it was bad, and then I watched it...
...it had absolutely no plot.  It seems more like a story written by a 3rd Grader.  Nothing is explained and the ending leaves you wondering in mystery where these people came from, why they wanted to do what they did, and what happened which wanted to make them do what they had to do.
Not to mention the blood, gore and unnecessary swearing in this film, it was an absolute waste of time.  Nothing was explained, and it was very desturbing.  Some people may like it, but in my opinion, this is trash.  Try something else.",982195200,3,697,4.2272727272727275
770331,1,6304060645,"This movie was a total un-waste of my time. I said this because it was so terrible, it was acually worth the time to watch! I couldn't believe the horror I endured while watching this drivel people call Anime. I am an Aniime fanatic, but this sucked! It was a plotless wonder with senseless violence and bad dubbing. The animation was so bad, I laughed everytime I saw this one guy's eyes move. The scene where the ""main character"" gives everybody people's lunches was just stupid. I didn't understand why everybody began hysterically laughing when he handed out lunches. YOU CAN HAVE MY LUNCH! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! This movie blows, trust me. My life has a terribly large scar because of thiis thing they call a movie.",981331200,3,718,4.752
7860440,4,6304060645,"This is a 1980s anime that is part of the ""catch all"" action genre.  Sometimes a publisher will create a movie or game that has a mix of different characters in it to try to net a bigger audience.  In the same way that the Escaflowne or X/1999 anime, tried to incorporate sci-fi with sword and sorcery, this anime is a mish-mash of bizarre this and that including:

A highschool aged martial artist who wears a Leapard mask
Evil fairies
A demon king
Hideous mutated demons
A space ranger ala Power Rangers
Evil teddy bears
A mystic demon hunter with a wooden sword
Some highschool romance

For people who like shonen anime (a bit of gore, a couple scenes of nudity and a smattering of 'fight scenes' broken up by the occasional dialogue and comedic character interaction) this may be right up your alley.  The ""high school"" portion of the story just sets the stage for all the weird characters to come out of the woodwork.  The art designs are decent enough, but the animation definitly looks 1980s, so don't expect something ultra smooth.  Plot is rather minimal because there are so many characters taking the stage that their individual minor plots keep stomping on eachother's stories.

This film was probably intended to be a B-film rather than something truly innovative, so accept it for what it is.  If the list of content above seems to interest a potential viewer, I'd say give it a rental and decide whether you'd like to purchase it.",1385942400,,1445,4.65748031496063
7860441,5,6304060645,"This is a prime example of classic splatterfest anime!

The animation, although quite old, looks great, its crisp, and very detailed.

Buy this if you are a fan of GORY hyper violent anime!",1209513600,,189,4.696969696969697
7860442,4,6304060645,"This is another anime which features lots of machismo and gratuitous violence that I like for some unknown reason.

Plot?  Part of the enjoyment of this is how inane the ""plot"" is?  Apparently, the main character (an ambitious high school student) is soul-linked to a demonic king that's in the midst of a power coup.  An androgenous demon slayer and futuristic cop also get mixed up in it as well.

Admittedly, I saw the dubbed version and it was unintentionally funny in several places.  Where else will you hear one girl, sizing up the competition for the main character's attention, say in despair, ""She's smart... and she's got a POSITIVE ATTITUDE!!""",1199145600,,655,4.8558558558558556
7860443,1,6304060645,"and hey, all you bozos out there, I've got news for you...

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE KOUSHUN TAKAMI NOVEL ""BATTLE ROYALE"", THE MANGA BASED ON THE NOVEL, OR THE SUBSEQUENT MOVIE DIRECTED BY KINJI FUKASAKU

so stop being a bunch of morons comparing this to any of the above.",1111104000,22,279,4.346153846153846
7860444,1,6304060645,"I bought this DVD because I thought like with so many other Japanese movies that the original Manga was as good or better than the cinematic version. NOT EVEN CLOSE. This sucks, it is a boring animation kung fu flick which doesn't hold a candle to Battle Royal.

As for the comment of some others here. It might be banned in the US (hooray for the country of freedom) but here (Netherlands) it is sold in almost every record shop en even in some toy shops who also sell DVD and video games and has an Age rating of 16.",1103760000,3,518,4.18

7860446,4,6304060645,"Overall the disc is put together well.  Decent menus, good video quality with both an English subtitle and language playback option.
The show itself is a pretty typical Kung-Fu anime.  The plot is only present enough to carry the program from fight to fight.  I will say that the fight scenes are very cool and worth seeing.  So if you like shows like ""Ninja Scroll"" this disc is something to check out.
Normally I'm not a fan of bonus material.  (I buy DVDs for the movie.)  Yet this disc has got a very cool feature.  They call it a video storyboard stream.  When selected the video is that of storyboards.  The whole movie plays this way, not just a couple of scenes like hollywood discs.  And while the storyboards play (in a highlighted area) the actual movie is displayed in a small window in the corner.  As an artist, I was intrigued with seeing how the conceptual storyboards related to the final show.
This DVD is worth getting.",1080172800,3,938,4.523809523809524
7860447,3,6304060645,"I agree with maxsixer, if you can find someone with the live action version of Battle Royal, you owe it to yourself to see it!  I read about the movie for the first time in Fangoria about 2 and a half years ago.  I obtained my first copy in VCD format from an anime convention of all places!  Also the book is more detailed and follows more of the characters and differs just slightly from the movie.  Either by reading or watching, you most deffinitely owe it to yourself to look into Battle Royal!",1063238400,,499,4.276595744680851
7860448,4,6304060645,"If you are lucky enough to see this film in non cartoon form with proper subtitles you are extreamly lucky, i thought this film was banned world wide except Japan of course. Its a film about a class of 40 students who are forced to kill eachother. Battle Royal or (BR) is in a sick way a game. each student is given a necklace that they can not remove and also has a detonator, each student is also given a random weapon. now hers the sick part, in 3 days all the neclaces will detonate unless 39 students are dead with one survivor. the survivor is then the !!WINNER!! nice eh?, a movie well worth a watch to see the crazyness of japanese story writers",1060560000,,653,4.232
7860449,3,6304060645,"""A Viewer"" is right on target with his review-- the most memorable scene in this movie is where the main character restores a girl to normal after destroying the monster that possessed her.  Unforgettable visuals on this-- almost worthy of 4 stars on that alone.
I haven't heard the dub, I've just seen it in Japanese, which I don't understand, but the plot, such as it is, is pretty clear, if you go with the flow.  It's a visual story, like most one-shot anime movies/ova's.
The movie is ambitious, crazy, parodic of anime high-school hijinks, violent...definitely worth a look, once a subtitled DVD comes out.
A negative reviewer who will go unnamed mentions a ""lunch scene""-- describing how the main character hands out lunches.  Evidently that reviewer was somehow watching the movie backward; the kids in his class all give him their lunches.  I figure they had their reasons-- guy must have quite an appetite.  Eating contests, at any rate, are not all that unusual in a high school.  In college, you move on to drinking contests.",1013558400,,1037,4.830508474576271
