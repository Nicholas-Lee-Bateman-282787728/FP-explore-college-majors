2290885,5,B0009HLDAA,"Yes, this is a very girly kiddy show but I think that they did a terriffic job on making it interesting for other ages. The first time I saw it I fell in love with it and am going to buy it as soon as possible.

If your wondering what it's about it's about Bloom, a fariy who doesn't know it until she meets another fairy, Stella, which happends to be a princess. Stella takes her to a magic school, Alfea, to learn how to use her powers, and durring her enrollment she meets some other girls and the five go through many things from dates with the Red Fountain boys to battleing witches at Cloud Tower. These girls form a club which they call the ""Winx club"", thus the title. Bloom is really the main character and it gose into more of her friends trying to help her find out who she is and where she comes from but I don't want to spoil it to much.

Well over all this is a must buy DVD!",1120867200,,889,4.016949152542373
2290886,5,B0009HLDAA,"I agree with the others, specialy, Christina (a kid at heart). It is about time this was released on DVD, and wanting and wishing alot more to come soon as well.

 I am an adult at the age myself of 30, but still love the Winx Club, and the show really also brings out the kid in me.

 This is really a wonderful cartoon and story for all younger girls who may be into this. This year will be a very nice 'Winx Year' with new dolls just out, the DVD now and another one on the way, and more toys and such, plus the Winx Club video games due out in this Nov. til Feb. of next year, this is indeed great times to enjoy and love the Winx Club.

2290914,5,B0009HLDAA,"The Winx Club Enchantrix Volume 1 (Season 1) has multiple episodes that touch on uplifting themes of magic, wisdom, and friends. For instance, episodes two through four deal with one of the characters coming to terms with breaking a curse placed on her by first being at the acceptance level of who she already is, even if her physical appearance is not accepted and/or celebrated among others. Im fortunate to have also watched and previously enjoy a spin off movie related to this series (Winx Club Magical Adventure). I also like how the Winx Club series plays on the ideas of different worlds. Yes, I know that this is a kids series, but these cartoons are also good to watch for those looking to boost their creativity and/or character development for writing stories, movie/play scripts scripts/journals for law of attraction exercises/processes etc.",1432339200,,856,5.035211267605634

I know that some parents will say that it is violent,but you have watched Tom and Jerry, The Looney Tunes, and the Power Rangers and that is as violent as those shows. Also, to Parents that will say they send bad body images, so does Barbie! They have more clothes on then most teenage girls have on now of days. This girls are really smart and brave and this show is trying to show other girls to do the same. It is about Good fighting Evil. This show is awesome and has loads of things to teach other children. Yes to other Wiccan practitioners, this show doesn't give witches a good name; however that isn't what this show is about. Also, at least this show is trying to show that magic can be good or evil and there is a difference. This show again is great to watch.

2291043,4,B0009HLDAA,"I have been watching this show with the kids (who are no longer kids) since it was on 4KIDs TV.  It started out being a show built around the character Bloom who was raised by adopted parents on Earth.  In her 16th year, she discovers she is a fairy when she comes to the aid of Stella, another fairy, being attacked by monsters in Bloom's neighborhood park.  Bloom is transported to Magix by Stella using her staff where she is enrolled in Alfea, a school for fairies. The Winx Club is formed with Bloom and Stella's and their dorm room mates: Flora, Tecna, Musa, and Layla/Aisha (who joins them in season 2).  They grow into a powerful and formidable group of heroic fairies and become the Guardians of the universe.  It has evolved into a really interesting show.  I am surprised that they let the girls grow up--not staying one perpetual age season after season.  The show got really interesting when it moved to Nickelodeon  (Volume 1 and 2 - seasons 4-6).  I didn't know it was created and produced in Italy with English voices.  That was an eye-opener. I was hoping to see at least the conclusion of the last season, but I think the show was cancelled by Nickelodeon.  The only way we will be able to see additional seasons is streaming through Amazon or Netflix.  So, thanks for including this show in your line up.",1398211200,2,1323,4.512605042016807

2291085,4,B0009HLDAA,"Me and my niece enjoy watching this series together.  The only down side was that I thought this was the Nickelodeon dubbed version and it was actually the Rainbow/4Kids version.  Don't get me wrong it was still entertaining to watch and I recommend this series very much but the difference in voices is somewhat disconcerting when you have to try and explain it to a child.  My other complaint would be that you spend fourteen dollars per volume to make up the series and in the end you end up paying more than the cost for the other seasons.  I also wish that this came in closed captioning.  I am hard of hearing and having to play it at extremely loud volume and stopping to play back parts that I didn't catch are nerve racking.  Just about everything comes in Closed caption so what does this not??
I was pleasantly surprised to get my order processed and shipped out to me so fast!!  Faster than is usual with Amazon.  My order was processed on a Monday afternoon and by Wednesday afternoon it was in my hands!!  I have never had anything shipped that fast using the Supersaver Shipping before!!

Next is the female body.  The 'fairies' are what, 18/19 years old?  They wear very skimpy, 'sexy' clothes and their bodies are unrealistically porportioned.  The unrealism would be fine, but these cartoons reflect the very thing that REAL WOMEN are working to oust from the American norm.  If you are a parent who is concerned about how your child sees the female body, this is definitely not the series for you.
Fear factor - wow.  The scary characters are sure to keep you, the parent, up nights reassuring your child that ice snakes and what-not are not coming to get them.  Nor are the scary weird bad guys, or the beautiful-mermaids-turned-into-sea-monsters.

Wow.  I am grateful I watched the entire first episode on my Kindle before giving in to my daughter.

This pretense continues through several episodes. This could be confusing for a youngster. But, if you are careful and do manage to buy in order, they are well worth watching over and over again.

1-It feels like magic:Bloom is an ordinary Earth girl who meets a magical fairy named Stella and discover that she is also a magical fairy too and decide to go with Stella to the Alfea school for fairies to learn how to use her magic.
2-more than high school:in her first day at Alfea,Bloom meets new fiary friends called Flora,Musa and Tecna and must survive the Cloudtower witches attack.
3-save the first dance:Alfea welcomes the new school year by throwing a ball and the boys of Redfountain school are coming but the witches tries to ruin the ball.
4-the voice of nature:the winx go to Black mud swamp to do school work,later, they see a Redfountain craft falling from the sky harmfully.
5-date with disaster:the witches traps Stella and steal her ring.

2291124,2,B0009HLDAA,"This is really nothing special at all, it is 'winx' after all, a series that is not at all 'good' in anyway to start with. The cartoons of the characters are poor, no artistic talent was put into the creation of this series. The books also feature the same poor art work as well, so again nothing special at all. Also one has to think and 'believe' the creators of 'winx' somewhat copied the whole concept otherwise, the girl 'stella' looks and is alot like 'cornelia' from w.i.t.c.h., and this stella is a poor copy of something that is great, that being the w.i.t.c.h. series,I suggest strongly, against this poor talent stuff, and go with something much better, like w.i.t.c.h..

I disagree with the person that said they copied W.I.T.C.H.

I saw the Winx Club Dolls out in stores & advertised on TV long before they had anything regarding W.I.T.C.H. out(TV or Stores).

So I think it was the other way around.",1135641600,9,284,4.222222222222222

It is about a girl named Bloom with the power of the dragon fire that is tooken to a school on magic to learn more about herself by opening her heart and believing in herself. It may sound like something a teen would like but it  has a lot of childish twist.
 In a way it is kinda of educational. It teaches to believe in yourself,never give up on what you think is right and good will always tryumph over evil.
  Even if you are a teen it still is worth watching. Bloom also has her friends Flora,Stella,Tecna and Muica to help her on her magical advetures. So it also teaches about friendship as well.
Over all yeah, it's worth buying!

2291130,3,B0009HLDAA,"I don't understand why anyone has to complain about this DVD here.  This is a place to help people decide whether they want to buy it, not diss it because of how it compares to another.  If you don't like it, don't watch it or buy it.  Winx Club is fascinating and this is coming from a 31 yr. old.  W.I.T.C.H. is also, and does happen to be my favorite of the two but only by a minimal amount.  Each show has positive and negative qualities about them and they are sooo not ""identical"", except for the fact that the girls have magical powers and transform (only changing clothes and hair).  I actually had similar feelings about ""Ghost Whisperer"" being too much like ""Medium"" but boy was I wrong...I love both and they may have a similar foundation but from there, they are different and unique.

Back to Winx vs. W.I.T.C.H. - When both shows appeared on American T.V. I was excited to have them to watch and the more shows the better.  I just don't like some of the other cartoons out there and am glad both of these are around.  I love well made cartoons that adults as well as children can relate to or just watch for the pure enjoyment of it.

As for Vol. 1 only having 5 episodes, I don't know if it's worth it to buy it for the price.  (This is my reason for the 3 stars rating).  If you just love the show on T.V. and have to have it, then buy it.  Recording the episodes in order can be a royal pain, so buying it may be the best option.  I don't understand why they can't just put out a boxed set of the complete first season as they do with most non-cartoon shows.  If they do that, I'll be sure to buy it, unless of course the seasons only have five episodes each, but I doubt that.",1129593600,15,1694,4.137614678899083

Way before W.I.T.C.H was released! So in other words Disney copied Italy's Winx Cub! The information you researched was false! The W.I.T.C.H comics might of been released before the Winx Club books came out, but the Winx Club show was released first! Then the W.I.T.C.H books came out, and a little later on the Winx Club books came... Then the W.I.T.C.H show was released...

Also for the fact that 4Kids dubbed the show with very well known actors such as Dan Green... The show is wonderful... And so popular that even Cartoon Network started showing it...
