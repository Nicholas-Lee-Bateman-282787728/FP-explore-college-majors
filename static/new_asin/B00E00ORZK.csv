5881084,3,B00E00ORZK,"The release of animated features has become more and more frequent.  With so much more competition, Disney is no longer the biggest kid on the playground.  Quite to the contrary, there are several kids on the playground - and they're all roughly the same size.  Illumination Entertainment has had major hits on its hands with the Despicable Me films and Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, while Sony Pictures Animation has cashed in with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and its revitalization of The Smurfs.  Still, no film studio has made more animated films than The Walt Disney Company, which also includes its vast library and the popular Pixar branch.  However, if there's one studio that has rivaled the success of Disney in recent years, it's DreamWorks Animation.  DreamWorks is responsible for such hits as Shrek, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, and The Croods.  And, the odds are DreamWorks will have another successful moneymaker on its hands with the sports comedy, Turbo.

Turbo stars the voice of Ryan Reynolds as Theo/Turbo, an average snail with an obsession for speed.  Theo never seems to be able to do anything right, spending most of his time watching racing videos on television and pretending he's a race car driver.  Theo's brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti), rejects his brother's obsession, believing he should spend more time focused on working at the tomato planet.  However, unforeseen events cause Theo to come into contact with nitrous oxide, which empowers him to move at extraordinary speeds.  Now going by the name ""Turbo,"" and working in an unlikely partnership with Tito (Michael Pea), a Taco stand owner, Turbo is entered into the Indianapolis 500 - where he must go head-to-head with his idol, Indy car driver, Guy Gagn (Bill Hader).  The voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Ken Jeong, Michelle Rodriguez, and Snoop Dogg also star in supporting roles.

To be honest, Turbo leaves a great deal to be desired in comparison to other popular animated films, like Toy Story or Monsters Inc.  While there's very little doubt this film will go over extremely well with kids, it lacks charming, likeable characters.  Ryan Reynolds has gone stale in Hollywood, so it makes sense that he's doing voice work in an animated feature.  At the same time, there's no better actor in Hollywood than Paul Giamatti, so it's a bit of a waste of talent for him to be dong voice work in a supporting role.  Speaking of supporting roles, the supporting cast is not remotely entertaining enough in comparison to the supporting cast of films like Madagascar, Toy Story, or even another DreamWorks film, Rise of the Guardians.  Their quips are tiresome, often lame and leave a gaping role where the comedy should have been.  However, there are brief seconds of humor from Ken Jeong, who portrays a woman shopkeeper.  Sadly, those lines were already used in the film's trailer and were basically good for nothing more than a quick chuckle.

Regardless of this film's numerous shortcomings, there's a great deal to admire about Turbo's character.  He's an imaginative, driven character that shoots for the stars.  Still, his hardships in life feel a bit lackluster, making it hard to relate to the character - especially since his biggest disappointment is being unable to save a tomato from a lawnmower (yawn).  By sheer dumb luck, he winds up with these ""Flash-like"" powers from an accident and from there on out, it never feels like he's properly challenged.  As much as the plot tries to bring him down in order to build him back up for the climax, Turbo is essentially the Michael Jordan of snail racing (or Mario Andretti if you want to stick with racing) - without a proper ""villainous"" competitor.  And, by the time he does have a villain to compete with - the film is basically over and the interest level in the plot has long since faded.  Perhaps another super-powered snail would have made for a proper villain, instead of using the Indy 500 landscape and actual race cars.  Including the Indy car series just diluted the film even more, making it feel like a giant advertisement for the race (not to mention Chevy's logo is all over the film, too).

The bright spot of the film is surely that quality of animation (plus the song selections are pretty excellent).  It never gets old seeing what these major animation companies can achieve with their authentic, yet cartoon-ish styles.  At certain points of the film (mainly during the racing scenes), if you had a controller in your hand, you'd swear you were playing a racing game on the big screen (which would be incredibly fun come to think of it).  Unfortunately, there's just something that's boring about starring at animated snails and a taco vendor for 90 minutes.  But, if you're someone that has ever dreamt of what a Fast & Furious animated feature would look like, the drag racing scene will at least feed your imagination in that regard.

Overall, there's very little doubt that kids will find a great deal of enjoyment from this film and if you're a parent wondering whether this film is suitable for them - the easy answers is yes, absolutely.  As far as adults or teens go, there's hardly any humor or meaningful entertainment to be found in this flick.  This film is completely average - nothing more, nothing less.  Films like Despicable Me and Toy Story (which are the golden standard in animation if you haven't gotten that impression already) provide for a high to moderate amount of humor for both kids and adults.  In the case of Turbo, the entertainment value for adults just isn't there.  In the end, this film is strictly for kids through and through.  Walking out of the theater, it will be easy for most to label this film as ""cute"" and if you're a parent, you'll quickly come to the conclusion that one day this film will most likely be on your shelf collecting dust (along with the countless other animated movies) as soon as it hits home video.

5881308,5,B00E00ORZK,"This movie is the superior successor of Cars in my honest opinion, they're quite similar movies yet while Cars is one of my most disliked films of all time, Turbo is in my top 3 animated films of all time. I just love the irony of how a snail wants to be fast and race in the indy 500 and how Turbo achieves that dream, it's just so charming. And from how his brother Chet doubts Turbo, but is also worried about him and how Turbo wants to race, you can see both sides and relate to it. Turbo is a very relatable character. The graphics are some of the best that I've ever seen and a snail protagonist is very unique and the ending was really heart warming, especially when Turbo finally gave up on trying to race, that's when Chet finally came in and convinced him to win the race which was good character development for Chet and it was quite heartwarming when Turbo decided to use being a snail to his advantage.",1455235200,,915,4.234285714285714

Until something happens that makes this little guy an exceptional candidate to race in the Indy 500. With a group of really supportive friends, human and s small alike, this little guy makes his dreams of making his way to the track a possibility. In the end, the snail discovers who his friends are and realizes that sometimes your biggest inspirations really aren't that great...that you just have to believe in yourself and go after what you love. I won't spoil the ending. I can say that both children and adults alike will love watching this underdog achieve his dreams.

5881398,5,B00E00ORZK,"I didn't get to the theater as much as usual in 2013, so Im catching up via rentals now.  One of those I missed was Turbo, and it was well worth watching.

The story follows the adventures of a snail who dreams of racing.  And yes, were talking car racing.  Not only does Turbo (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) stay up nights watching tapes of races; it interferes with his day job of corralling the rotten tomatoes his co-workers send down from the vines.

One day, an accident infuses him with the one thing he craves, speed.  Then he finds himself in the possession of a taco truck driver, Tito (Michael Pena), who thinks that Turbo just might be the way to get his brothers taco stand notice.  Will it work?

Obviously, this animated delight has no basis in reality  especially in the final act when Turbo, as a snail, fulfills a dream of racing cars.  But you know what?  I didn't care.

Why is that?  The film is filled with delightful characters from start to finish.  While Turbo and his brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) have their disagreements, they do obviously still care for each other.  In fact, I loved how their relationship mirrored that of Tito and his brother Angelo (Luis Guzman).  The other owners of the shops in the strip mall where much of the action takes place are fun as are the other racing snails in the complex.  I truly loved all of them and enjoyed spending time with them.

The voice talent is wonderful.  Whether famous or not, the only voice I recognized was Samuel L. Jackson, but it fit the character so perfectly I didn't find it a distraction at all.  The actors did what they needed to do, allow me to get lost in the story.

So how lost in the story did I get?  During the climax, I was so into it I found myself yelling at the screen.  Yes, I knew how the story would end (it is fairly predictable), but in that moment it didn't matter.  Maybe its a good thing I didn't get to catch this one in the theaters after all.

And I cant leave out the comedy.  While the premise may be crazy, the execution is perfect, and I couldn't help but laugh the entire way through.  The scene where Turbo first discovers his changes is especially funny.

DreamWorks Animation is a mix of stylized and realistic.  This one ventured more toward the realistic side of things with several beautiful shots throughout the film that come close to rivaling Pixar at their best.  One key scene takes place in the Los Angeles River (dont get me started on that drainage ditch), and I recognized it.  This was before I knew the setting was the LA suburbs, and I was pretty excited with my catch.

Turbo was delightful from start to finish and Im sorry I didn't get to see it sooner.  Dont let this one race by without stopping to enjoy it yourself.",1434240000,,2752,4.396825396825397

5881463,3,B00E00ORZK,"Kind of the standard 'you can do it if you try hard enough' plot-line.  There are a number of scenes that skirt on poor taste, but I am not down-starring for that.  I am down-starring for two specific scenes that a small child might mimic and endanger themselves.

The first scene is where the snail is 'immersed' in nitrous-oxide and subsequently has the ability to go really fast.  I would hate to hear about a kid going through dad's collection of garage chemicals (or his friend's dad's collection of chemicals), kids dare each other, etc...  I really wish they had not made the miracle of the movie be a toxic chemical.

Likewise, in a later scene, the snail is crawling all over power line wires and insulators.

Now, you could argue that the entire movie is like that, with snails crashing into walls, riding birds, etc... ok, kids get that some things are obviously not good to do.  I'm focusing on these two scenes because they both portray the star of the movie doing something that kids could easily do and kill themselves.  There are enough kids poisoning themselves and electrocuting themselves without this movie.",1423440000,,1127,4.7384615384615385

You could say that maybe it was because I wasn't expecting much in the first place, but my expectations were exceeded.  Exceeded.  Shattered.  Annihilated.  Voided.  Turboed.  I was left completely speechless at the movie's (nay, film's) conclusion, yet I felt such a strong sense of public duty and righteousness to muster the effort to share pure unadulterated (leterally) joy with anyone who might ponder giving this film the old ""one, two"" (like, two eyes, like ..watching the film).  With my eyeballs filled with wondrous imagery and my earballs filled with enchantment, I was as but a youngster frolicking in a green meadow (preferably in the Alps), or tasting Cheeto for the very first time.  I wish that I had first borne witness to this yesness at a younger age, and I wish that I had first sifted through this wicked happiness at an older age, but, well, you know what?  I'm glad that I watched it right now.  Clapping, sobbing, laughing, trembling, with complete, uneclipsed delight, I was entranced by the terrifying creativity, penetrated by the salient plot layers, and all at once amused, horrified, enthralled, and giggling at the utter loveliness of this film, of life, and of the greater universe, or shall I say multiverse, physical or imagined, real, or yet to be real.

5881572,4,B00E00ORZK,"Despite a rash of previews that looked promising, I was slow to get around to Turbo; no pun intended.  From the looks of it, it appeared to be a plug & play kids film package- lowly snail, known for lack of speed, ridiculous dream of being one of the fastest creatures on earth, laughed at by all, in a mishap becomes fast, series of events lead to his becoming a global hero thanks to his speed.  And guess what?  That's exactly what it is from start to finish.  But even going in with that mindset, coming away feeling fulfilled by the experience is completely possible thanks to the attention to detail that only DreamWorks brings to the table in these situations.

Turbo is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy sports film produced by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by 20th Century Fox. It wears a PG rating and comes in at a run-time of 96-minutes.

What's really interesting is how the film came to be.  As most anyone on the planet is fully aware, computer generated (CG) feature films are BIG business.  Successful films often go on to rake in hundreds of millions in their theatrical runs and some companies (some that start with D for example) are masterful at merchandising the snot out of these films; lunch boxes, action figures, Halloween costumes, bed sheets and on and on.  In short, a winner in this industry means unimaginable profits.  By and large DreamWorks brings some pretty interesting concepts to the genre and has struck gold time and again with franchises like Shrek, Kung-Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon and so on.  Even still, they occasionally find themselves in a slump for fresh concepts.

Enter David Soren, a lowly DreamWorks employee and one of dozens who were invited to partake in a company competition to submit a single-page pitch for the next big CG film franchise.  He combined The Fast and the Furious with snails and ended up being selected as the winner.  Though, and pardon the endless pun potential here, the idea crawled along at a snail's pace for roughly 5-years before DreamWorks finally decided it was time to take the project seriously.  Soren actually got to make his directorial debut on the piece and well, here we are.  Having been head of story to such pieces as Shark Tale prior, it's safe to suggest this one could have went either way.

There are a lot of parallels between Soren and the titular character, come to think of it, particularly the idea of a low man with a big dream. However while the character goes on to win big in the end, the film hasn't been a commercial success.  Produced on a budget of roughly $127-mil (plus $175-million in marketing) Turbo has since gone on to rake in close to $300-million.  One doesn't need to own stock in DreamWorks to realize that's the kind of return shareholders don't like to see.  In fact the studio took a $13.5 million write-down on the film; This marked the second film in two years that DreamWorks Animation has lost money on after Rise of the Guardians.

As for potential sequels, no official announcement yet but DreamWorks does have a very rich history f turning successful films into successful franchises after all.  Additionally a 2D animated series has spawned from the film on Netflix known as Turbo: FAST.

Anyway, all of this, while riveting to be sure, really doesn't tell you anything about whether or not you might like the film itself, allow me to get back on track here.  That could be another pun too but I digress.

Turbo tells of a a speed-obsessed garden snail with dreams of becoming an Indycar racer who, by the magic of an unfeasible accident, becomes saturated with nitrous-oxide and thus extremely fast (and not just fast-for-a-snail but fast period; 226mph kinda fast).  From there it's a meteoric rise from racing against other snails right to the big leagues: participation in the Indy 500.  Never mind such nuances as it would probably be more believable for him to enter a biological-being race, like the Boston Marathon rather than one designed for machines; realism was clearly not the mandate on this one.

What ensues, really, is a series of enjoyable character interactions along the way.  This is the real meat and potatoes of the film. DreamWorks is nothing if not very cast savvy and choices like Ryan Reynolds as Turbo, Luis Guzmn as a taco slinging Latino, Samuel L Jackson as the roughest snail this side of the tracks and Snoop Dogg as the burned out, fuzzy pink dice sporting mollusk Smoove Move make this reality very clear.

The story breaks no new ground and in fact, can probably be assembled using pieces and bits of other animated films before it like Antz, Cars and Disco Worms but again, what this one lacks in originality, it actually makes up for with some charming characters and genuine humor that will appeal to viewers of all ages.

DreamWorks' greatest strength, perhaps, is their ability to integrate perfect character archetypes to keep the pacing razor sharp throughout the story-arc and this film is no exception.  Turbo may lack Pixar's cleverness and Disney's infallible marketing schemes but it does offer a solid hour-and-a-half's worth of animated entertainment loaded with visuals that are oft downright stunning.  If that isn't reason enough, the cast alone is worth the investment.",1413331200,,5280,4.798895027624309

5881635,5,B00E00ORZK,This movie did not get a lot of love when it was in theaters and that is unfortunate because it is a very good movie and not just for children.  We initially watched this for free on Netflix with our 5 year old and he just loved it so much that he started pretending other toys were Turbo and racing them.  The premise seems silly but this movie has a heart of gold!,1407369600,,366,4.0
5881636,5,B00E00ORZK,"This was a very fun movie for our whole family.  Turbo is the typical story of ""If you want enough, get lucky and work hard, you can get what you want"".  In this case, Turbo a snail named Theo had always dreamed of being fast.  Through an accident while attempting to save his brother, Turbo is zapped inside the workings of a street race car and is transformed.

This is a cartoon.  If parents have not taught their children that cartoons aren't real and the feats they perform are impossible to a living person they should not blame the cartoon, but themselves.  Snails don't talk.  Snails don't get sucked into the turbo charger of street racers and turned into drag racers themselves.

Again, this was a fun movie.  It was entertaining, I laughed -out loud several times, my son laughed out loud and mom snickered a lot.  We enjoyed watching this as a family for family movie night.  It was well scripted, well animated and, unlike some typical movies, not too long.",1407369600,,970,4.5813953488372094

5881649,1,B00E00ORZK,"Movies help our children frame reality. They give images to emotion, context to experience. They can help children (and adults) thru difficult experiences, build fortitude, and encourage them to reach their dreams. Movies also have the ability in the same vein to distort our experiences, establish false expectations, and tamper with our emotions. 'Turbo' falls squarely in the later category.

As a movie about a snail who 'dreams big,' and then achieves his dream, on the surface this may seem to be a movie we want our children to see. But there are really two movies here. The verbal story for adults which children barely pay attention to, and the visual story that children see and adults seem to overlook.
The visual story is the most damaging.
Turning off the sound, figuratively, the story told is of a creature that wants we he inherently cannot possibly have. Then through magic, he gets it. And then all he has to do is boost it, push himself to the max, and reality bends to his will.

What I am afraid children are learning from this movie is not that you should reach for your dreams (a worthy aspiration), but rather that you have to be something you are not in order to be happy, skill comes magically and mythically and you either have it or you don't and you don't have to develop it, and when you have skill then you push yourself to the limits all the time.
The first idea taught is grandly reinforced at the end of the movie when all the rather morose snails from the beginning of the movie are only happy at the end of the movie when they to get to pretend to be something their nature is at odds with.

Children learning these principles will evidently reach for their dreams, but will do so in a way that will interfere in their ability to achieve them. Impertinent impatience will replace patient striving, and they will settle for success in endeavors that conform to their expectations for a ready made, ready fit reality, which is only really found in video games, and give up quickly when they feel that they are not a 'natural.'

Expectations I want my children to learn? No.

5881729,3,B00E00ORZK,"Following the Cars fireball, multiple machine-animal-human feeling type films came out ( e.g. Planes and this one, Turbo), all trying to recapture te magic of the original, and becoming cliche in the meantime.

Trailers for this looked quite good, but not enough to go to the movies for. So move night, ordered in pizza, and got lined up for this......Frankly very disappointing. Weak story, no real in interest  in the characters, and animation looking like bad gameboy CGI.

Normally, my son will watch a new moview for 1-2 weeks, but he's never asked o see this again.",1398038400,,571,4.865979381443299

5881739,4,B00E00ORZK,"One of the risks with having too much of a particular type of movie is that eventually you have to start stretching for ideas just to keep the audience coming back for more. That seems to be happening to some extent with the seemingly ubiquitous family-friendly animated feature, where the plotlines have become a tad farfetched even for anything-goes CGI animation.

Take Turbo, for instance, a tale of a NASCAR-loving snail (!) who dreams of one day competing in the Indianapolis 500. After hes accidentally exposed to a massive dose of nitric oxide, Theo becomes a turbocharged speed machine capable of clocking in at 200+ m.p.h.. When hes discovered by Tito, a husky L.A. taco vendor who sees Theos potential as a racer, the snails dream gets one step closer to becoming a reality.

The good news is that those who made the film - writer/director David Soren, co-scenarists Robert Siegel and Darren Lemke -- have the talent and conviction to bring the concept home. With an underdog racing plot very similar to the one in Planes, Turbo is a sweet, fast-paced and visually elegant film that knows how to move and how to mix humor and sentiment in roughly equal measure. The race sequences are so good that you realize while you're watching them that they owe as much to Ben-Hur as to any racecar picture - which is very high praise indeed.

With voice work by Ryan Reynolds, Paul Giamatti, Michael Pena, Samuel L. Jackson, Luis Guzman, Bill Hader, Maya Rudolph, Ken Jeong, Michelle Rodriguez and Snoop Dog, Turbo takes the absurd and makes it entertaining.",1397260800,,1559,4.809701492537314

Had a few funny parts, and the kids loved it.  Otherwise, I would give it negative stars.  And I love movies like this as a rule.  When I watched the preview, I was foaming at the mouth for this movie.  In retrospect, I wish I'd stuck with the preview.

He chose ""Planes,"" which he loved but we thought was just OK. After ""Turbo"" came out on video, we rented it, and we LOVED IT. I laughed more in the first 30 minutes of ""Turbo"" than I did the entire showing of ""Planes."" It's got so much more personality! Highly recommend this one.",1391817600,,470,4.119565217391305

5881862,4,B00E00ORZK,"Turbo is a decent DreamWorks animated adventure film that has a great message about going after your dreams and achieving your goals, even when people tell you that it's not possible.  The animation is good, it's DreamWorks, they know what they're doing.  The voice acting is great with a huge cast of established stars who bring lots of personality to their characters (Ryan Reynolds, Paul Giamatti, Michael Pena, Samuel Jackson, Snoop Dog, Bill Hader... and more).

Something else to keep in mind, possibly best of all, if it's a big hit with your kids and it comes into heavy rotation, it won't likely make you want to throw yourself into traffic.  In my humble opinion that is one of the most important aspects of any movie targeted at my kids.  How many times can it be on the background before I contemplate self injury to make the movie stop.  :)  There is enough going on that it's entertaining for adults as well.

The movie absolutely shares many themes with Cars.  If it's a race animation picture... how could it not.  In the end, it definitely can stand on it's own and while I wouldn't fork out $30 for this picture, if you can find it on sale I think it's something that you could definitely sit down for a family movie night and enjoy.",1391731200,2,1251,4.544642857142857

I'm only contributing the fact that the digital copy works for BOTH an iTunes file, as well as the UltraViolet (UV) copy.
There cardboard outer case as well as the back cover say that a ""Digital HD UltraViolet"" copy is included, but does not explicitly state compatibility with iTunes.
However, inside the set is an insert with a digital code valid for either type of digital copy. I personally prefer the iTunes format, but I'm glad the studio provides us a choice of digital files. Thanks, DreamWorks!!",1390953600,,603,4.8076923076923075

5881928,5,B00E00ORZK,"I wasn't aware of Turbo when it was in theaters and do not recall any trailers for it. Being a fan of animated films I decided to give it a shot and I'm really glad I did.

Turbo isn't going to win any awards for being different, but it is still a very satisfying and fun film. I'm a big fan of Pixar and Disney, but I found Turbo to be more entertaining than either Cars film and Planes for that matter.

I thought the characters in Turbo looked a little generic, but after actually viewing the movie I was pleasantly surprised how polished the animation looked. The voice work is very good and for a 90 minute cartoon film, this movie flew by!

If you're looking for a family friendly animated film that is full of heart, then give Turbo a shot, it's one the better animated films of the year.

The Blu Ray looks and sounds fantastic and has some interesting extras.",1390003200,2,868,4.274390243902439

5881947,4,B00E00ORZK,"I'll admit, I'm getting a little tired of Ryan Reynolds, but this film was very cute and my whole family (ages 5 to 41) enjoyed it.  The characters were engaging and entertaining (Whiiiiiiiite Shaaaaadoooooowwwwwww), and the story was good.  There weren't any real ""bad"" guys in the movie, which is refreshing.  The antagonist is one of the better ones I've seen in animated films, as he's a little deeper than good vs. bad, and really helps the story come full circle.

It is good to see that Dreamworks is finding that formula and bringing something to the market to offset the flood by Pixar (who makes great movies too, most of the time).  This was a good formula and the voice cast was great.  I have no doubt we'll see a sequel in the next couple of years.",1389657600,,762,4.4855072463768115

Sure I could see where the story line was going, where parallels were drawn between characters, and that Turbo would win in the end, but I have seen a lot of movies.  To my kids this is all fairly new and they thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie, laughing at all the right places, and cheering for Turbo to win the race.

Since my son really loved the movie, we decided to get it for Christmas this year and our family really enjoys the movie (good, inspiring story) and the music (fun, funky hip-hop style jams that the kids run around singing).

We purchased the Blu-Ray, DVD, & Digital combo but then he received this copy as well. We [parents] were set to return this one and get some Turbo toys or something but my son was adamant that he wanted the toy from this one. Since it was his gift, we did let him keep it and we'll just pass the movie along to a friend or something. The toy isn't super high quality so I'm not sure how long it'll last (it has been carried around everywhere for a week already). It also is pretty light weight so when you try to ""race"" it doesn't go far or fast. That part is a little disappointing, but my son still loves it. In the end, it's a neat kid's movie & toy, my son loves it, and I'm not annoyed by it (always a plus)!",1389398400,,1003,4.091370558375634

5881980,3,B00E00ORZK,"It's a fun movie for kids. I only gave it 3 stars because of the fact that turbo the snail raced in the Indy 500 is such a stupid notion, he's a snail for crying out loud. Although my 5 year old likes the movie.",1389225600,,211,3.7111111111111112

5881985,2,B00E00ORZK,Wasn't as good as I was hoping it to be. Kinda let down overall by the whole concept but I have seen worse. Didn't really like the cast of snails except for Ryan Renolds part. Maybe some people would like this animated film and I did give it a chance just wasn't my cup of tea.,1389139200,,277,3.9642857142857144

5881987,4,B00E00ORZK,"The idea of a snail racing in the Indy 500 is insulting to the intelligence of an adult, but in this movie they make it work.

5881991,3,B00E00ORZK,"It was kind of slow, ironically.  Much slower than you'd think a movie titled, ""Turbo"", would be.  It couldn't keep my son's attention even for limited intervals, which is the best you can hope for really.",1389139200,,205,4.666666666666667

We frequently turn the closed captioning on so that we can keep up with what's going on if someone talks over the movie and this one was missing every other line of the captioning.  I don't know if that was part of the streaming or if it was from the actual movie, but if I'd actually been hearing impaired and tried to watch this, I'd have been really mad.",1389139200,,393,4.226666666666667

I did not even pick the HD method to down load and it takes as long to down load the movie as it takes to watch it.

5882002,5,B00E00ORZK,"I saw this movie a few days ago, it was a favorite!!! It's about following your dreams, facing big challenges, and not listening to what others think that you can and can't do. The main characters are Theo, a snail obsessed with racing, and his brother Chet, another snail that thinks his brother is crazy for risking his life trying to get a tomato before a lawnmower does.(Tomatoes are very important if you are a snail.) One day, the duo bumps into a restaurant owner who wants Theo (turbo) to enter the most important race in America: the Indianapolis 500! Great movie, I want to see it again! :)",1389052800,,600,4.513761467889908

5882005,5,B00E00ORZK,"I live in MS now, but I lived in Southern California when I was a kid.  This movie was intended for my granddaughters, but it hit very close to home as far as where it took place, the snails, the talk, the food and the life in general.  It made me homesick.  Besides that, I thought it was a very excellent entertaining movie for me and my granddaughters.",1388966400,2,355,4.1911764705882355

5882007,4,B00E00ORZK,"I think it is a good movie , my children loved it! It was fun to watch , it has some thrilled to it and some few funny lines and importantly it has a moral lesson as well. So over all it is a 4 stars to me.",1388966400,,206,3.3125
5882008,3,B00E00ORZK,"First, I will say that Ryan Reynolds is an actor I have loved for years since his ""Two Guys and a Girl"" era, so anything with him in it I am bound to love even just for his part alone. With ""Turbo"" I of course loved his acting (he always makes me laugh hysterically) and there was other shinning acting parts as well (Bill Hader and Paul Giamati really stood out), but the story kind of wandered a bit. I laughed quite a few times, but other times the jokes fell flat and failed to impress. My kids enjoyed it for the most part, but I did notice that here and there they had wandering eyes when the plot wandered for a bit and then caught their attention once again. Overall, it has it's moments, but it's not exactly a hit.",1388966400,,724,4.141843971631205

5882011,5,B00E00ORZK,The poor little snail  never let go of his dreams.  He never quit even when things got tough for him or when the other snails said he couldn't become a racer.  Great suspenseful ending!,1388880000,,185,4.382352941176471
5882012,5,B00E00ORZK,"This is an entertaining little movie that kids will enjoy. The story of a snail who refuses to be ""slow and steady"" but lives for speed, Theo is like the ""Little Engine Who Could."" When he accidentally gets supercharges and can zoom along like the racer he wants to be, he changes from Theo to Turbo and attracts the part owner of Dos Bros Tacos who enters him in a snail racing contest and from there decides to enter him in the Indy 500 (or as he says, the ""Indy 5000"".) His brother snail is a nay-sayer, wanting Theo to settle for being what he is...a snail, but the other snails on the Snail Racing Circuit think he has what he takes.  The characters are funny, the villain so broad there's no doubting he IS one, a couple of snails get scooped up by crows, and a few bugs hit the windshields, there's a couple of racing crashes but apparently everyone survives so the violence quotient is pretty low. It all boils down to ""Believe in yourself even when others don't,"" and is something we all need to hear once in a while.",1388880000,2,1026,4.316062176165803

5882029,4,B00E00ORZK,"After reading some of these reviews I find myself blown away and being compelled to leave my own.
1. This is a kids movie people! No in real life snails don't talk and inhaling nitros does not give you super powers. Neither are there monsters, talking cars, sloths being used as belts and conversationalists, evil villians using small bannana shaped, jibberish speaking midgets, etc. It is fantasy MEANT to enocurage kids to reach for their dreams no matter how impossible they seem. Also being a kids movie I personally refreshed with the lack of adult themed jokes movies like Shrek are famous for. If you want to watch an adult movie there are plenty out there animated and otherwise. Leave the kids movies alone! Some of us can be entertained without having to hear a x rated joke.
2. This is a racing movie. This movie centers around racing. If your kids like racing they will love this movie if they couldn't care less about racing this movie would (of course) not hold their interest.
3. Just an FYI this is not a Disney movie. This movie is by Dreamworks (owned by Fox).

My personal family experience.... We loved the movie! Is it predictable? Of course! We adults knew that despite the impossibility the snail would win Indie. But it was still fun to watch his journey. The snail goes from his cushy predictable life in a garden in the burbs to ultimately wind up at a run down taco stand with new friends who actually try to help him along instead of constantly knocking him down as his neighbors and family had done. Ultimately to doing the impossible and racing in the Indie 500. Admittedly we did not laugh as much on this movie as we had on The Croods and Dispicable Me 2. But it was much better (in my opinion) than Monsters University (I mean they took revenge of the nerds and animated it for kids!) and Epic (the worst named movie of all time! In my lifetime of 30 years this ""epic"" movie has been done and redone at least 4 times.) My only real complaint was when he won he didn't kiss the bricks. So with that small (big if your a racing fan) discrepancy and the fact is was not the absolute best movie of the year I give it 4 stars.",1388707200,,2154,4.4120603015075375

This one did not hold his attention like Nemo, Lion King, Wreck it Ralf, Cars, etc. He and I enjoyed it enough but he wasn't asking for it again the next day and I am glad he didn't. The plot is story line is just ridiculous, which is fine but it doesn't come through on humor for kids or adults and is not engaging. At the end you don't really care if the snail wins or not. Kids don't seem to fall in love with the characters like other movies. Not a bad Friday night rental but we won't be doing it again.",1388534400,,571,4.017543859649122

It's just another of the many DVDs aimed at entertaining and enlightening kids these days. The viewer sees a funny and kids rated story that also offers lessons on attitudes, accepting physical and other challenges as well as gifts, and getting along together. Happy story and happy ending.

5882066,3,B00E00ORZK,"Turbo is a fun movie to watch, especially for the younger audience. Adults may become a little bored with it about half way through the movie. Although the story is not very original, the animations and graphics are top notch, especially the scenes during the big race in the second half of the movie. The 3d is very well done, and there are more than a few scenes with very good ""pop out"". The rest of the time, the 3d depth is above average. Overall, I would recommend buying the 3d Turbo Blu ray for the visual experience, and definitely if you have younger kids.",1388448000,5,566,4.4

There was no momentum to keep us interested and it was just plain slow and boring.  We all walked away from it at some point to go do something else  and then would come back to see if it was getting any better.(my husband, 8 yr old, 6 yr. old, and 2 yr. old).
The upside is that my 8 yr old did manage to find a good message--""go your own speed and it will be good enough"". The only reason I gave it this many stars is because I REALLY appreciate that it was very clean--no adult humor or inuendos or hidden swear words, potty humor....etc.  I really appreciate that, I just wish they could leave all that stuff out and still make a great, entertaining movie.",1387584000,,770,4.175675675675675

Like most children's movie that are coming out these days, this movie boasts some superior animation, great voice acting, and lots of action. What it is lacking (in comparison to its peers) is copious amounts of humor. Laughs have become a staple of modern day movies for kids. After all, movie studios want to make movies that are entertaining for the adults as well as for the kids, since adults are the ones who are really going to shoot a movie down if they don't enjoy it. Unfortunately, Turbo is a bit short on laughs. I laughed a few times, but not nearly as much as I had hoped or expected to. This wasn't a movie that I walked out of the theater thinking ""I've got to get this one for my kids when it comes out on Blu-ray."" Since one of my kids requested it for Christmas, I did end up purchasing it, but honestly, I think watching it one time was OK for me. It isn't one I will look forward to sitting down and watching again with my kids.

If you are looking for an ideal movie to purchase for your kids, there are many better movies to pick other than this one. It's OK, but nothing terrific.",1387584000,,1190,4.242290748898679

5882132,4,B00E00ORZK,I honestly can't understand the derision and bad press this movie got . . . I just got finished watching it with the kids and I was really impressed.  Ryan Reynolds did a decent job of voice acting and Paul Giamatti and Samuel L. really helped lift the movie up.  The entire movie was fairly fast paced and very entertaining for the kids (and me).  Bottom line:  this was a good movie that you really do want to see.,1387497600,,416,4.227848101265823

Well done animation and good quality acting with a fun story for both kids and adults.  The movie has both wit and heart.

Both my 11 year old niece enjoyed this along with us two adults that were sitting and watching.",1387497600,,330,4.360655737704918

5882137,2,B00E00ORZK,The story line is totally ridiculous.  The kids thought it was okay. But we won't be buying this movie. Just as bad as Cloudy With  a Chance of Meetballs.,1387497600,,154,4.275862068965517

5882141,1,B00E00ORZK,"This movie and the movie planes are both so derivative of the movie Cars that the producers should be ashamed of themselves. The snail was completely unlikeable, and the story was just as unbelievable. Add the standard ethnic character types and current pop references and this is what you get. Garbage! My kids hated it. Even my 5 year old daughter, who loves most anything, specifically told me she didn't like this. Glad it was only a rental!",1387411200,8,445,4.717948717948718
5882142,5,B00E00ORZK,"Bought this for my granddaughter as she saw it at the theatre. Being an open wheel race fan, the idea of a snail beating Power, Castor-Neves, Dixon, Hinch, et al., does not thrill me, but it beats watching Cinderella or Snow White!",1387411200,,231,4.523809523809524

5882147,5,B00E00ORZK,"Watched with my 6 year old grandson.  He loved it!  The lesson in this movie is don't give up on your dreams.  True he may have had ""super powers"" but the end will surprise you.",1387411200,,177,4.0
5882148,5,B00E00ORZK,It's just too cute of a movie. You save so much $$ buying this if you plan to also put the digital copy on your iPad.,1387324800,,117,3.5384615384615383

5882151,3,B00E00ORZK,This was a cute movie.  It is another movie with a triumph plot. It almost seemed like a Spiderman spinoff.,1387324800,,107,4.35
5882152,4,B00E00ORZK,"While I thought the movie was a bit strange and not really my cup of tea, my six and three year old boys thought it was great. It's got tacos, bugs and racing, everything boys love so how can they go wrong.",1387324800,,206,3.9285714285714284
5882153,2,B00E00ORZK,Thought this would be a cute movie for my 11 year olds.  Both lost interest after about 10 minutes.  Boring story line (even for kids).  Save your money.,1387324800,,153,4.392857142857143
5882154,5,B00E00ORZK,"Hey! It's a RACING SNAIL! What's not to like. This film has big time stars like Paul Giamatti and Samuel L. Jackson, who are all having WAAAAY too much fun! And of course that speedy snail TURBO...the snail who thinks he's a car.

5882157,5,B00E00ORZK,"I think this is one of the best 3D movies I have seen since it does an awesome job of rendering what it would be like speeding around the Indy 500 as a snail.  However, I will say that I think people who want to buy the 3D tv might keep in mind it appears to be a VERY dense file and even on newer TVs, it may buffer.  My TV is 2011, and without a memory stick in the TV, it was almost unplayable.  I put in a 16 gb memory stick into the TV's USB port and then the buffering largely went away (only a little).  I had noticed this same issue with Immortals 3D  which is also a massive file.  Even if there is a risk your TV might buffer if it is older, I would still recommend getting the 3D now, since at the time you upgrade your TV in some # of years, you can then enjoy it then.",1387238400,,781,3.731707317073171

Being from Indiana I have been to the Indy 500 several times so it was a very comfortable story line.  Paul Giamatti as a snail, snoop dogg and Ryan Reynolds works well.

I gave it 3 stars because my kids' opinions brought the rating up. Now, I know it is a kids movie, but I couldn't help but picture other movies as I watched....there was no new ground here. Re-tread themes and overall story pulled from Cars, Talladega Nights, etc.

Also wasn't sure how to feel about the ethnic stereotypes. They weren't offensive, but again, no new ground. There were the Hispanic taco-making brothers, the elderly female Asian nail salon owner, the mildly creepy but McGuyver-like male Caucasian hobby store owner, the tough girl Hispanic auto repair shop owner.....and then there were the other snails. Don't get me wrong, Samuel L. Jackson, Snoop Dogg and Paul Giamatti add character to anything but I just felt that there was no point to it. I guess it seemed that the characters were ethnic for the sake of being ethnic.

There were some cute moments and some laughs throughout so there is entertainment value. Plus, the kids liked it, which is all that matters, right?",1386201600,,1142,4.757575757575758

For comparison, off the top of my head, of the movies available at Amazon Instant Video, here are movies that both my children and I always (or almost always enjoy):

Tangled; Incredibles; Finding Nemo; Monsters, Inc.; Despicable Me; Toy Story; Toy Story II, Toy Story III; Shrek; Megamind; Kung Fu Panda; Ice Age: The Meltdown; Bee Movie; Tarzan; Enchanted; Cars

Here are the movies that my children enjoy, and I sometimes enjoy:

Bolt; Meet the Robinsons, Monsters U; Brave; Shrek 2; Shrek 3; How to Train Your Dragon; Rio; Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs; Madagascar; Madagascar 2; Mulan; Pocahontas; Bug's Life; Lilo & Stitch; Hunchback of Notre Dame

Here are movies that are great, but both my children and I must be in a certain mood to watch:

Wall-E; Up; Ratatouille; Robin Hood; Sword in the Stone; Alice in Wonderland; Most of the older Disney movies

Movies that don't make the cut, which means we only watch them if we're desperate and my children lose interest fast:

5882275,3,B00E00ORZK,"WARNING: This review contains so-called ""spoilers."" I say ""so-called"" because I find it hard to believe that anyone could watch this film and not figure out what's going to happen, but I guess you never know. So, consider yourself warned.

Before I talk about the story, let me discuss what works in the film: This movie is visually gorgeous. I don't watch a lot of animated films, so it's sometimes breath-taking for me to sit down with one and see just how far computer rendering has come since the last one I saw. The detail and perspective and just overall look of this movie is fantastic. Also, as a children's film, the overall plot is simple enough, the various jokes cartoonish enough, and the pacing revved up enough to keep a kid's attention for the film's 90 minutes. You'll also probably have kids clamoring for the inevitable line of toys (racing accessories sold separately?) that this movie seemed designed to market.

However, if you have a kid that thinks too hard about stories, or if you're just an adult looking for some eye candy, the film is a weak, watery, predictable mess. Let me count the ways.

1. Our main character is a snail who has named himself Turbo. Turbo has an unstoppable desire to be fast, hopefully someday fast enough to join the Indy 500. His brother, Paul Giamatti, rightly thinks this is a stupid dream, and grows ever frustrated as Turbo constantly puts himself and other snails in danger with his head-in-the-cloud fantasies. Other than this, Turbo has no personality traits at all.

2. In a (suicidal?) malaise, Turbo accidentally gets sucked into a street racing car and is given a nitrous oxide bath, he develops the ability to move hundreds of miles an hour, and also gains headlights, a car/shell alarm, and a pretty powerful radio/sound system. Should we ignore the disturbing implication that Turbo is only able to achieve his dreams with the help of magic speed juice? Should we ignore the logical problems with a snail suddenly getting blinkers? Let's.

3. Turbo is discovered by a struggling taco salesman, a chubby Mexican guy (sigh) named Tito. He runs the taco business with his level-headed brother, Angelo. When Tito discovers Turbo can move hundreds of miles an hour, leaving an unreal, blue phosphorous trail in his wake, he tries to get Turbo entered into the Indy 500. Angelo disapproves, giving us our movie's first theme: brothers suck. That's right, even though Turbo has an unreal, otherworldly power, neither Angelo nor Paul Giamatti are impressed and still think Turbo is a lost cause. This is where the movie started to lose me. I mean, come on. I just willingly allowed that a snail morphed into a tiny car. Now you want me to believe that this is not going to be a big deal to EVERYONE IN THE WORLD?

But of course it's not, because otherwise the movie wouldn't be able to hopscotch neatly through every ""follow your dream"" cliche in the book, including fighting against the people who are constantly saying ""you can't do it."" But, of course, Turbo COULDN'T do it. Not until he got injected with that powerful chemical that ... oh, yeah. I said I was going to ignore that.

Ahem.

So, encountering resistance every step of the way, Turbo finally makes it to the Indy 500 to race alongside his racing idol, Bill Hader (doing the best job out of any of the actors). Turns out Bill is secretly a jerk -- surprise, surprise -- and tries to kill Turbo during the race in front of the whole world. There's a huge pile-up in the process, and Turbo's shell gets cracked and -- uh oh! -- he loses his magic powers right at the end of the race! But what's this? Paul Giamatti finally believes in his brother, and he delivers a big speech about how the power was in Turbo all along, and Turbo inches across the finish line under his own speed, narrowly avoiding being crushed by the livid Bill Hader.

And I call ""boo."" The movie tries to shoehorn this message of self-empowerment at the end as if that was what it was meaning to teach all along, but it makes absolutely no sense in light of the rest of the film. ""Follow your dreams no matter what anyone says! You have it in you!"" the movie pretends to be saying, while subtly adding ""as long as you get a little help from a wishing star and glowing blue fluids."" There are so many other plot turns and twists, so many other story avenues that a mutant speed snail movie could've taken, but this film takes the safest, oldest, and dumbest one of all. And it doesn't even do it consistently! At the end, for no reason other than because kids will certainly want it to happen, Turbo has his powers back. How did that happen? Who knows? He also has a cadre of snail friends with different morphing shells that didn't exist before. Why?

Oh, that's right. Toys.

A brainless, shameless attempt to market merchandise alongside a moral message that the movie only half-believes in, TURBO is only enjoyable on the shallowest of levels. Oh, and -- I can't get past it -- I'm pretty sure it's the first pro-steroids kids' film I've ever seen.",1385078400,,5047,4.615384615384615

Yes, this can be unlocked in ITunes which can be viewed on the different Apple products without an Internet connection!

If Digital Copy (non-Internet) is a factor as it is in our family, then be careful what you purchase because just because it says Digital Copy, it might mean internet connection only!",1384905600,4,627,4.305084745762712

You just can't wait for it to end.  Turbo offers up no surprises, but it ends up being a decent movie that you can enjoy as a family.  By the end, my 7 year old was standing up cheering for Turbo.  Honestly, I was cheering inside too.",1384905600,,393,4.0519480519480515

I actually thought this movie had more for adults than kids - some of the jokes/puns really go over a kid's head, but to an adult they're awesome. The real surprise for me was how good/addictive the soundtrack was (including a lesser-known song by the Jackson 5) - they stuck in my head, so much so I later downloaded some of the songs.",1384819200,,415,4.402597402597403

5882297,5,B00E00ORZK,"I bought this sight unseen, not even knowing the cast.  It surprised me when I recognized Ryan Reynolds as Turbo, the cute little snail who dreams of being in the Indy 500.  While the plot isn't at all believable, it was the cutest and most original movie I've seen in a long time.  Yeah, it does start off feeling like a Ratatouille knock-off, but it quickly takes a different path. This one appeals to all ages, and I loved it.  My family has watched it 3 times since we got it, and I'm sure we'll watch it again soon.  The ensemble cast is great, and there are MANY laughs throughout the story.  You know it's something special when you are rooting for a snail to win a car race.  I just don't understand the few bad reviews for this movie.  You people either have no heart or no sense of humor!  Maybe both?  Try watching it again and do it with an open mind.  It doesn't have to be real to be enjoyed!",1384732800,,906,4.179190751445087

5882301,2,B00E00ORZK,Eh! Turbo was just okay. It had potential but just never delivered. For a 5 year old maybe but more & more adults are watching animation films and the film must be able to woo the adults also. I know it's just a cartoon but it wasn't put together well.

5882305,5,B00E00ORZK,"Such a fun family movie! I saw this in the theater and it was one of the best film experiences I had this past summer. This film was really overlooked by the general public because it came out after Despicable Me 2 and Monsters University, two sequels to two massively popular films. Dreamworks really dropped the ball on the release date. It should have came out later in the year and I think the box office return would have been much higher.  Hopefully this film will find its place on Blu Ray and DVD, much like the under appreciated Dreamworks film Rise of the Guardians that came out last Christmas.",1384473600,,605,4.5

This tiny little movie called turbo...came through with flying colors! It's got heart and makes the smallest dreamer in you come alive. It makes you think anyone can achieve anything they dream. That's what Disney usually is all about. I really thought I was watching a Disney movie but it's made by DreamWorks. Don't get me wrong...I love DreamWorks movies too..but I always thought Disney and Pixar had the heart and soul of every movie they make. This movie reminded me of a little bit of bugs life mixed in with cars. It's touching and funny at the same time. I highly recommend this film for the young and the old. Monsters university is only for adults. Monsters Inc. Was for the young and the old just like turbo!",1384473600,,873,4.602564102564102

I was completely wrong!
This was definitely for the whole family. Kids won't understand all the jokes,thankfully, but that's a good thing. They will love the adventure, action and lovable characters. Parents will love that the kids stay focused, while having a few laughs at those jokes the kids don't get.
It was also fun trying to pinpoint each actor or actress to the voice. Lots of famous favorites are the voices behind these characters, like Samuel L. Jackson and Snoop Dog. (I know he is Snoop Lion now, but he'll always be Snoop Dog to me.)
Plus the ending is ""perfectly predictable"" and everyone is happy!",1384387200,,711,4.696

5882317,2,B00E00ORZK,"Turbo is an absolute, although harmless, miss.

And I'm not just saying this for adult audiences. I watched Turbo with an audience of 8 kids, and not one of them really laughed, smiled, or showed anything more than remote interest. Virtually everything about this movie is misdirected and stale.

First off, there's the ludicrous premise - a snail gets sucked into the engine of a dragster and magically gets headlights, a car alarm, and can go speeds upwards of 300 miles and hour. Turbo does not require audiences to suspend their disbelief, but hang it from a gibbet and throw the remains into the sea. When you can't relate to your main character, you aren't invested in the movie. When you aren't invested in the movie, the movie is bad.

Second, there's the puzzlingly dark tone. Seriously, did this take place in Sin City or a charming kid's movie? Half the movie takes place in these dark scary, derelict slums, inhabited by strange characters that are not in the least bit reassuring for kids. The snails are not the worst of it; it's the humans that are the real miss for Turbo. As shown by my child audience, not ONE of the humans is remotely interesting or relateable.

Third, there's the film's lazy tone. Turbo isn't even trying. At least Smurfs 2 - the worst cartoon of the year - was anything BUT lazy (and also devoid of ANY redeeming features). Turbo is content to creep along at a snails pace, without any sort of colour or life. The plot is as cliched as they ever come, meaning the movie is not remotely interesting. It has the old ""Follow your dreams/Wish upon a star/Dream big/You can do it"" sentimental, cliched trite coming out the wazoo.

I could go on, talking about the poor attempts at puns, quirkiness, and sentimental ending, but really, this is a movie for kids. It shouldn't be dissected that much. But it's not a GOOD movie for kids - it fulfills the barest obligation for a kid's film - it's a harmless, moral-teaching, remotely interesting cartoon for kids that won't do them any harm. It won't do them much good, though, either.

And one more thing; I noticed that both The Smurfs 2 and Turbo used the pun ""Snailed it"" at least once. These films happen to be the worst kids fare of the year. Maybe someone should have taken note.

P.S. For some GOOD 2013 kids fare, seek out The Croods, Monster's University, Despicable Me 2, or Epic. Cheers!",1384041600,6,2379,4.596698113207547

I'm a huge fan of Dreamworks, which is mainly the reason I gave this a shot, and they didn't disappoint.

5882367,4,B00E00ORZK,"Seeing the trailer for `Turbo' a few months back I was rather determined that this was going to be one of those films I skipped entirely.  Then my girls caught wind up it and begged and pleaded and I thought, I'll rent it.  Then the film was released and they begged some more and I said ""let your grandma take you"" but for some reason I wound up sitting in a theater last night waiting for what I only assumed was going to be `Cars' with snails.

`Turbo' is far from a truly intelligent or unique film, and yet it manages to be not only fun and engaging but charming to a point where I found myself completely entwined in the story and the characters.  The tried and true themes of `dreaming big' are not something new or untold with animated films.  Animated films, which are manufactured for children, are there to inspire confidence and help them to realize that they can do anything they set their mind to.  That is why in animated films, rats can cook, wimps can train dragons and snails can race cars.  Impossibilities exaggerate truths for kids and help them to `dream big', which is something we want for all of our kids.  Like I said, this is nothing new, and `Turbo' doesn't really even attempt to make it new, but it does handle its themes and premise with spunk and charm.

The film tells the story of Theo, a worker snail who harvest tomatoes in a garden but watches Nascar at night, dreaming of one day being a racer.  The huge obstacle being that he is a snail and thus VERY slow.  Still, this and the fact that his antics cause turmoil within his social circle and ridicule from his fellow workers does not stop him from thinking outside of the box, and when a freak accident leaves everything in his slug-juice, Theo (aka Turbo) finally sees a light at the end of the tunnel.  When a down and out taco shop owner snatches up Theo and his brother for some snail racing his powers wow this small community and soon Theo finds himself racing in the Indie 500.

I'll say this; I'm really happy that films like this, `Monsters University' and `The Croods' have developed stories with no true antagonist other than life's obstacles and so we aren't force feeding our children more and more stories about evil people doing evil things.  The chief antagonist in `Turbo' is the mere fact that Theo is a snail, with a fame hungry racecar driver playing a minor obstacle in the end.  There is no evil snail trying to kill him.  Sure, there is some `Sid-like' kid that lives across the street who likes to crush snails on his bike, but he's not evil but merely a toddler and it's played up for comic relief.

Speaking of comic relief, `Turbo' is genuinely funny.  The voice work from the cast is great, with Oscar nominees Paul Giamatti, Samuel L. Jackson and Richard Jenkins spouting off alongside SNL alumni Bill Hader and Maya Rudolph with Snoop Dogg, Michael Pena, Michelle Rodriguez and Ken Jeong lending their talents as well.  Everyone hits their notes and makes a unified ensemble.  The sight gags (especially with the crows) are hilarious, and the use of music is rather inspired.  That spoof on the viral sensation of `I ain't got time for that' was one of the highlights of my movie year so far!

So, with a surprised spirit I say ""GO SEE TURBO!!!""",1376524800,115,3265,4.489001692047378
5882368,4,B00E00ORZK,"I went into this movie with zero expectations, and hoping that Ryan Reynolds wasn't going to be embarrassed too badly by Dreamworks Animation Studios. I was pleasantly surprised. Turbo turns out to be like most Dreamworks cartoons; entertaining for the kids without playing down to them, while still giving the adults a few things to chuckle at.

Unlike most Dreamworks films, or most films at all actually, Turbo spends most of the film without a primary antagonist, and hence, without a deeper purpose. As a garden snail, he spends all day at his job at ""The Plant"" dreaming of racing. After work, he spends all night watching race cars and idolizing Guy Gagne, one of the top racers in Formula 1 (and, possibly a reference to Jean Girard of Talladega Nights, who is also a French racer who dominated F1 before taking over NASCAR).

Without a real antagonist, Turbo is held down to earth by his brother, Chet (Paul Giamatti), who supervises him at work and tries to keep him rooted. When an accident at The Plant costs them both their jobs, Turbo ""runs"" away from home, and accidentally finds himself at the start of an underground race as a hood ornament. Yet another accident swoops him up into the engine of one of the cars just as the driver switches on the nitrous oxide, altering his DNA and turning him from a common garden snail into the fastest creature on no legs.

So we've got a story. Now, onto the cast. Several other snails make appearances in the film. Whiplash is portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson, doing what Samuel L. Jackson does best: saying common sense things with a raised voice so they're funny. Snoop Dogg lends his voice to Smoove Moove, a thin, wiry snail who wears fuzzy dice around his neck. Michael Bell appears, and then disappears, as the White Shadow, a snail whose name is also his catchphrase. Maya Rudolph and Ben Schwartz round out the Starlight Snail Crew as Burn, a female snail who has a thing for Chet, and Skidmark, Whiplash's ""feisty #2."" Michael Pea and Luis Guzmn appear as the Lopez brothers, proprietors of the struggling taco stand Dos Bros. Tacos, who both have different ideas to revive it and mimic Turbo and Chet's relationship very closely.

In spite of its lack of a villain for a good hour and twenty minutes, Turbo manages to do what it sets out to do: give kids and adults alike a little laugh and a little distraction. It also gives a hefty bit of inspiration in the form of Guy Gagne who delivers a quote from his father: ""No dream is too big, and no dreamer too small.""",1376092800,,2529,4.588495575221239
5882369,5,B00E00ORZK,"Below are reviews by two of our youth film critics, one from a 15-year-old and one from an 11-year-old.

Geared towards kids under the age of 10, ""Turbo"" will be sure to have kids delighted and cheering the snails on. However, the excitement merely lingers for a short while, just like the exhaust trail from a racecar speeding by.

For a movie about racing snails, ""Turbo"" isn't half as bad as I thought it would be. Although initially skeptical, I changed my mind for the better because of the movie's amusing wit and heart. A normal garden snail named Theo has big dreams of being the fastest racer in the world.  His brother, Chet, sees Theo's dream as nonsense and a distraction to their work in the garden. One day, a freak accident involving Nitrous Oxide changes Theo to Turbo. Suddenly this snail has the abilities of a car - headlights, a stereo, and of course, unparalleled speed powers! A Mexican taco seller, who shares the same dreams as Turbo, enters the snail in the Indy 500. On his journey to the greatest car race in the world, Turbo befriends a gang of smooth cool snails (you'll never look at snails the same way again) and meets his rival, the menacing racer, world-renowned Guy Gagne.

The plot is straightforward and simple, mixed in with heart-warming feel-good morals typical of underdog family-friendly animated genres. ""Dream big!"" the film seems to shout at every turn.  I could have done without highlighting the message quite so much. Although ""Turbo"" starts off slow, it gradually begins to pick up speed. The filmmakers also could have included more brother bonding moments between Turbo and Chet.

The voice-overs are solid, especially Ryan Reynolds' Turbo and Paul Giamatti's Chet. The snail gang is hilarious, voiced by Maya Rudolph, Ben Schwartz, Kurtwood Smith, Snoop Dogg and Samuel L. Jackson. Unlike Blue Sky Studio's ""Epic"" that came out earlier this year, DreamWorks hired big names not because of their celebrity status, but because their voices actually fit the slick, suave characters.

At its best, ""Turbo"" is a heart-pounding inspiring flick, perfect to keep kids entertained. ""Turbo"" isn't going to make its way into my evergreen library but certainly this family-friendly film will grab the kids' attention long enough to give parents a much needed summer break.  The 3D is impressive! I felt like I was really racing alongside the snails. The film offers a snails-eye view, an interesting perspective especially while racing. ""Turbo"" can't be compared to Pixar's movies, but even so, it's a rip-roaring adventure. Reviewed by Cassandra H., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic

I loved the movie ""Turbo!"" It is really fun and must have been an awesome movie to act in. This movie is an animated film about super-speed snail racing and features the voices of many different actors. Turbo is a lonely garden snail who is about to gain super speed powers and will race in the ""Indy 500"" which is meant for cars but, his amigo Tito didn't take ""no"" for an answer.

This is a fast-action movie where Turbo, who watches a speed race every night and idolizes Guy Gangn who is the national champion racer. Turbo memorizes every line he says as well as the commercial for the drink: Adrenolade. One day, when he is working in the garden, a ""big red"" tomato falls on the other side of the garden where the lawn is being mowed. Turbo is so slow that he imagines he is the racer racing for the ""big red"" tomato. He does not make it to the tomato but he still goes on his own journey in the rain all alone. This is when everything starts to happen and Turbo receives his powers by a racing car's kind of gas.

The main characters are Turbo the snail (Ryan Reynolds), Tito (Michael Pena), Chet  (Paul Giammati), White Shadow (Michael Bell), Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson), Smoove Mov (Snoop Dogg), Burn (Maya Rudolph) and  Skid Mark (Ben Swartz). All these characters are great but my favorite and the one that stands out the most is Chet because he was pretty annoying and he is the one that puts most of the negativity into the movie.  I thought it was really cool how the writer did that.

My favorite part is near the end where after Turbo loses all of his powers and then tries racing again at Dos Bros Tacos for everyone to see. All of a sudden, when it is almost time to race he gets all of his powers back in an amazing magical moment and it is really nice and cool. Turbo is really happy that he gains back his powers and speed. I recommend the movie to all ages for anyone who loves action-filled adventures and having fun. I also found this movie very cool and safe for children to watch. It has very funny characters and scenes. The moral of this story is that even though you are a small snail and have big dreams, you can do anything you set your mind to.

5882370,4,B00E00ORZK,"""Turbo"" is another wonderful film for the entire family from Dreamworks Animation Studios. Directed by David Soren (Merry Madagascar) who also co-wrote this film with Darren Lemke (Jack The Giant Slayer, Shrek Foreverafter) and Robert D. Segal (The Wrestler, The Onion Movie). It starts and stay a ittle bit too long in first gear for the first 20 minutes, but then it picks up is pace and we'll have you laughing, cheering and sniffling a lot all the way to the end!

With such a heartfelt well-rounded cast, it has Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) cast an over ambitious and extremely wishful snail wanting to be the fastest snail in the world. All he wants is to just enter, and  of course win, the Indy 500. (Yes, he's a snail. Shell and all!) Now of course all his fellow snail friends and co-workers  in the garden he works atand especially his brother Chet,  voiced brilliantly by Paul Giamotti (Sideways, The Illusionist), all have a poor and somewhat pathetic opinion of Turbo.

By an act of nature (or chance) and the imaginary champion racer in his head Gay Gagne, voiced and performed artistically by Bill Hader (Suberbad, SNL), he is depressed and discouraged to the point where he teeters over an LA freeway in his rejection. Accidently falling and `fueling' his DNA up with some Turbo charged fluid after falling into a car he becomes FAST. Literally fast. Exceeding speeds of over 100 miles an hour! Now he Is kidnapped by a pair of Mexican brothers for `snail racing'.

The story then moves in a parallel line with that of two Mexican brothers (Tito and Angelo) trying to keep a Taco business alive in Van Nuys, CA. The older brother is having a tough time making ends meet while the younger brother keeps coming up with crazy schemes that never quite hit the mark. Tito is voiced sincerely by Michael Pena (The Shooter) who finds and really believes in Turbo and Angelo is voiced by Luis Guzman (Boogie Nights) who is more than skeptical of everything his brother does.

Enter literally a ""gang"" of snail that will not only encourage and motivate Turbo into pursuing and getting his dream of racing in the Indy 500, but then even help and push him into new heights of both latitude and of the heart. Samuel L. Jackson (Django, The Incredibles) leads the pack as pack with some hysterical sidekicks like Snoop Dog (Bruno), Maya Rudolph (Bridesmaid) as Burn, Ben Schwartz (House of Lies) as Skidmark, Richard Jenkins (Jack Reacher) as Bobby.

The story, as you guessed it, allows turbo to enter the Indy 500 and the rest is fast paced, intrigue, drama, action and a lot of near misses because his hero Guy is not quite a man you want anyone to look up too. The real villain is having a low self-esteem in yourself will only hold you back, however when his idol turns out to be something a lot less than he expected, Turbo's heart and drive is literally broken!

The movie is fun and it has a lot of California, specifically LA references that will crack you up! The racing sequences are amazing and the whole movie is very colorful just make sure you bring a tissue or two for the end. You'll probably want go and hug all your family members after the movie. This is for the family of all ages I loved this one! Turbo is `Turbo-Charged' with a heart!",1375228800,4,3281,4.5948717948717945
5882371,4,B00E00ORZK,"so like most parents this seemed like a movie i would hate...my daughter had been bugging me to see it ever since she saw the first trailer,poster,etc! it finally came out and she was dying to see it(shes 4 and a HUGE Cars fan!!)

i wasn't gonna take her but i ended up getting 1 free movie ticket..so i thought ""eh..for $6(we caught the 1st viewing so it was cheaper)i don't mind taking her""(but not for $12+!)

I gotta say is that im glad i got that free movie ticket!

we went the next day it came out...she was so excited she didn't eat her lunch(or popcorn or candy we bought lol)she wanted to take a picture in front of the poster and we even went into the theater 30mins before it started and picked out our seats....

not to my surprise there was about 5 other families with their kids(maybe a total of 25 people including us) in the theater...

ok..the first..15 mins or so..i was ready to leave it was SO boring..but as soon as turbo got his powers the movie picked up...my daughter was on the edge of her seat the WHOLE TIME..like i said..she didn't even eat her popcorn or candy!...

the jokes weren't that funny...i mean..i didn't even laugh alittle bit,not even a pity laugh...

anyways..it has a nice story,to be yourself and you can achieve your dreams(well thats what i got from it lol)

I was presently surprised at how much i actually enjoyed watching the movie and not just cause my daughter was having fun but because it was a cute movie with a cute story and cute characters! although the first 15 mins are real ""SLOW"",it was worth sticking around and watching..it was cute and i loved the characters...snoop dog as a snail! what?! lol

my daughter has been going off about turbo since then..every time we see a poster or anything she freaks! i got her one of the turbo toys..and she hasn't put it down since!! (he pretty much just became the new lighting mcqueen to her,which is her #1 fav anything!)

5882375,4,B00E00ORZK,"It only struck me recently that now that I have a five-year-old I could take him to pretty much any kid's movie under the slightest pretense.  This is exhilarating -- I hadn't read up too much on what ""Turbo"" was about besides the fact it featured...ya know, a snail. And that's pretty much what I got.

Here's what you need to know: ""Turbo"" is actually about brotherly relationships.  Snail Theo (Ryan Reynolds) dreams of becoming a race car driver like his hero Guy Gagne (Bill Hader); his workaday brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) disapproves.  They have good jobs in a human family's tomato garden, but it regularly involves being carried off (AKA eaten) by realistically-rendered crows.  My son was unfazed by this, so mission accomplished.

When a freak accident transforms Theo from a hopeful snail to speed demon Turbo with a pimped-out shell, things take a surprising turn.  Instead of following the typical superhero plot by trying to hide his special nature from adults (read: humans), Turbo immediately embraces his new superpowers and becomes the literal and figurative vehicle that propels another plot: two human brothers trying to make it big.

Dreamer Tito (Michael Pena) believes Turbo can enter the Indy 500 and bring fortune and fame to the Starlight Plaza while his more practical brother Angelo (Luis Guzman) harangues him for not making tacos.  Rounding out the human population is a parade of ethnic stereotypes: tough autobody shop owner Paz (Michelle Rodriguez), hobby store owner Bobby (Richard Jenkins), and most offensive of all, nail salon owner Kim Ly (Ken Jeong, pretending to be a little old fat woman). But never mind that, this is a movie with urban heart -- and we know that because it has Snoop Dogg as snail Smoove Move.

The Starlight gang decides to escalate to switch from snail racing to the real thing.  Yes kids, this is a real thing. And so the humans pool their money and go on a road trip to get Turbo entered into the Indy 500, accompanied by kooky supporting snails: Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson), Burn (Maya Rudolph), Skidmark (Ben Schwartz) and White Shadow (Mike Bell). These snails are a crazy catalyst to push the plot along when things get boring.

Surprisingly enough, it works. Between the point-of-view car racing, the insane snail antics, and the occasional harangue by an older brother who knows better (snail or otherwise), ""Turbo"" speeds along at a good clip.  It's also the first movie that kept the boy's attention through the entire film.

There's quite a bit of naive optimism in ""Turbo"" that goes unspoken.  Nobody ever shows up to dissect Turbo even though he's plastered all over television.  And although technically Tito is out to exploit Turbo for cash, it feels more like two hopeless romantics helping each other achieve their dreams.  ""Turbo's"" conclusion is a surprisingly close race that plays for keeps -- which is saying a lot for a film about a superpowered snail in the Indy 500.

Hobby fans will be amused by Bobby's comment that the Indy 500 is ""bigger than Hobbycon!"" Or bigger than Gen Con, which takes place in Indianapolis too.  And kids...well don't take my word for it. My son said it was his favorite movie.  He's looking forward to the upcoming television series spinoff.",1374451200,,3257,4.89799635701275
5882376,3,B00E00ORZK,"Even an old fart like me can appreciate animated films aimed at kids, so when my grown son and his wife decided it was time to take my 2 year old grandson to his first movie, I got to come along.  The youngster is fascinated with cars, speed, color and reckless behavior.  In other words a typical 2 year old boy.

In this DreamWorks production, Turbo (Ryan Reynolds) is a snail fascinated by the Indianapolis 500.  His goal is to break the world record by covering a meter in a day or something.  His brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) tries to tell him he's not going to ever be fast, but Turbo isn't convinced and often rebels at his regular job of harvesting tomatoes.  In a freakish accident Turbo is ingested into the engine of a street drag racer and while circulating among the pistons, inhales a goodly amount of Nitro methane injected into the fuel line.  Magically, rather than by being killed, the poor mollusk takes on super snail speed.  Enough speed that he can keep up with Indy cars.

With help from a Van Nuys taco bender named Tito (Michael Pena) and some obviously more hip snails he meets (Samuel L. Jackson, Snoop Dogg, Maya Rudolph, Michelle Rodriguez, and Mike Bell) off they go to register for the 500.  Once there he has to confront his hero and great French driver Guy Gagne (Bill Hader).  As you would expect they have a mighty duel for 500 miles and an unsurprising finish.

""Turbo"" is a bit light on adult humor but the kids are going to love it.  As for my grandson, he and I were pretty much on the same page.  When there was a lot of talking (human morals and expectations transferred to garden creatures) we were a bit antsy.  When the action is going on and the sound is everywhere, we were paying attention.  Seen with kids, the movie can be fun.",1374278400,40,1776,4.418461538461538

The movie is hugely predictable and throws in big plot elements that can literally break the movie into pieces, But the way the movie did the racing scenes was put into the movie like a work of pure Art. The Animation is so vibrant, The movie although telling from the point of view from snails looks very vibrant, It also looks a bit to much like a rip-off of A Bug's Life but as it is , its very fantastic animation. The movie handles the racing scenes spectacularly because of the right tone needed to animate racing scenes and has fast animation that is animated fantastically.
