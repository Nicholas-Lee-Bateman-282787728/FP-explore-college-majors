1994047,4,B0001EFUFK,"Well, this is van Sant finally back to his most artful and creative since 'My Own Private Idaho,' another misunderstood gem of overlooked cinema.
The imagery is well put together, and the sound is arranged very rhythmically, emphasizing the particular mood of each scene--rarely is background ""noise"" so artfully employed.  The pointless chatter between the characters and the swimming camera perspective may seem like mere stylized documentary, but I feel that these elements contribute more to the film being a poem than some sort of fictional expose.
A lot of people have simplistically written this off as pseudo-documentary because there is no obvious central perspective or storyline.  I loved van Sant's use of non-linear narrative.  My favorite example is a scene which takes place in a hallway, one character taking a picture of another character, while a girl in the background walks by.  The scene is replayed three more times, each time with a different bit of the story exposed before we get back to the hallway, and each time from one of the three characters' different perpectives.  This isn't just gimmicky repetition a la 'Memento'; 'Elephant' works the same event into many layers, where the layering gives meaning instead of a traditional A-B-C plot giving meaning.
And can we forget all this nonsense about ""social messages"" and ""explaining a tragic event""?  Film is an ART, not a casestudy science experiment.  And who cares if van Sant can explain his work.  Viewers should be more interested in bringing their own meaning to a film, not just expecting some tied-up-in-a-bow moral from a director.  But I suppose it is part of our culture now to be passive and not think critically about much of anything anymore.",1074816000,6,1735,5.059649122807017
1994048,4,B0001EFUFK,"Van Sant once again takes you on a virtual reality tour of the minds of young adults.  This film should NOT be taken as a documentary, but as a journey into the thought process of our young people.  As he did in My Own Private Idaho, Van Sant lets us see into the mindset that our current culture is inflicting onto our youth.  If you're 14 to 19 years old, you understood this film whereas most adults probably won't.  Cheers again for Gus Van Sant.",1073174400,3,450,4.258823529411765
1994049,1,B0001EFUFK,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have seen in the last 3 years or so. The story evolves around two gay teens who order guns over the internet and then go shoot the kids at their school. One of them plays piano and the other plays a fake FPS on his laptop as if to insinuate that that is the reason for their outlandish behavior. About 60 minutes of the movie is very weak character development that has no relevance to anything in the conclusion. There really was no point in making this movie at all, the actors were terrible and the script was bland. If you have an hour to waste I still wouldn't recommend seeing this film. On a similar level of comparison to.....Gigli?",1073088000,5,682,4.294573643410852
1994050,5,B0001EFUFK,"In ELEPHANT, director Gus Van Sant provides us with a day in the life of a high school, seen literally from the perspective of several students. Life in high school is presented realistically as boring. Some people have good times; others don't. Even the awkward girl isn't given many scenes to generate sympathy for her character. As a viewer, you don't really get to know much about any of the characters. You see that some of them are talented. Some of them are troubled. Some of them are just going through the motions.
Going into the film, you should be aware that a shooting will happen on this day. But, while watching it, you don't know when it's going to happen, who's going to do it, who's going to live or who's going to die. But the sense of dread you get builds as the film goes along.
Once the film identifies the shooters, we get a brief glimpse of their home life. We see how they got the guns. We get only an idea of the sort of video games they play, the films they watch, the drawings they've created. (The only real elephant seen in the film is a drawing that one of the killers has done and placed on his wall. He doesn't talk about it. We just see it.) We see one of them is a really good piano player. We see that he gets occasionally picked on by bullies, but we don't get the sense that he's overcome with a need for vengeance. We see the killers speak of the last day of their lives, and they kiss. We don't know if it's the first time they have done this. We don't know if they're gay or straight. I got the sense that this is the only time that they'll get a chance to kiss anyone, so they kiss each other. (Van Sant himself is gay, which I think is key. He's not suggesting that gay people are killers. But he's not saying that the killers in his film weren't repressed homosexuals, either. In the scene, he's saying that homosexuality alone cannot be seen as a reason for the violence.) No real motive is provided by the film itself, but you get hints of what actions other people will blame after the fact.
The film, in this extended scene outside of the school moreso than any other, shows the point that the filmmaker intends - that there is no way to determine the causes of this sort of violence and that there are no messages or clearly defined ""heroes"" and ""villains"" within such violence. Van Sant supplies the audience with a glimpse of several things that will be examined and dissected by others in the community within the film in the aftermath of the violence.
But, in taking us inside the school during the shooting, he shows us that it is random, brutal, unmotivated and cold violence. It has no reasons or explanations, because nothing this tragic can be blamed on any one thing. The killers even deserve some consideration because they're children, just like the other victims.
The film is excellent and thought-provoking, though it's bleak and sad.",1070409600,89,2896,4.425093632958801
1994051,5,B0001EFUFK,"As a high school student, I found this movie very powerful as well as truthful. When I walk through the halls, I don't know everyones life story, their personalities, their ""character"" isn't developed to me.  The audience's relationship with the characters in ""elephant"" is the same as the people you see everyday but don't bother to get to know. Did the killers know the people they murdered?  The character development in this movie is not important because in high school knowing people outside of your group isn't important.
  People don't realize the affect they have on others.  I feel that some of the reviewers misinterpreted the meaning of this movie. I don't feel it was meant to explain school shootings or relive Columbine, but to give an honest look at how oblivious we are of one another.
  Never have I been so disturbed from a film soley because of the truth behind it. And frankly, I'm not looking forward to going to school on monday.",1068854400,10,952,4.733333333333333
1994052,5,B0001EFUFK,"I was one of the first people to see Gus Van Sant's new film
elephant. It had it's North American debut here in Portland Oregon. All I can say about the film is that it's nothing less
than amazing. Elephant is a tender,fiercely intelligent,achingly
beautiful,and in the end,properly upsetting meditation on the
Columbine massacare and other similar incidents of high school violence. Elephant is composed of seemingly incompatible elements that rub against one another as disturbingly as in an anxiety dream, it is as elusive-intellectually and emotionally-as the real-life horror it references.",1067385600,4,595,5.478260869565218
1994053,2,B0001EFUFK,"Gun Van Sant has nothing to say about the Columbine massacre.  Strange that Elephant got so much praise (most notably at Cannes) when I found Zero Day to be the far superior film on the topic.  Zero Day had suspense, it had drame, all of it oozing from the mock home video style presentation.
Elephant, on the other hand, is about Gun Van Sant with an overly artsy look at high school.  There is no statement, there is no drama, there is Van Sant's excrutiatingly long tracking shots following students around the building, around the corners, into the classrooms, through the cafeteria, through the library, through the bathrooms, through the fields, and then, sometimes, following them again through the same scene from a different angle.  We don't get to know much about the killers; instead we got some cheap and frankly, ill advised scenes of them watching Nazi history shows, playing a first person shooter video game, and ordering guns from the internet in an almost laughable scene that damages the credibility.  (The last movie I saw with a character getting a mail order gun was Death Wish 3). Then, with no regard for secrecy, they take their new civilian assault rifle to the garage and merrily take target practice on a woodpile while neighbors are oblivious.  The scene drips with cynicism that hides behind the arsty presentation.  And perhaps worst of all, before the big day when they slaughter their fellow students and teachers, the two teen boys shower together and share a kiss in a scene where taste is lost and artistic license fumbled.
At 81 minutes, this is a padded out 'celebration' on the nothingness of adolescence, or at least that's what it seemed like.  The film did nothing for nearly an hour, and then, awful as it sounds, I was really waiting for the shooting to finally start.
The film then gets really offensive.  Zero Day handled it all brilliantly.  Since it was all home and found video, the shootings were seen as we saw them: from the high school security cameras, with a 911 operator speaking over it.  Instead of boring me to tears it created a deeper tension because of the time spent with the characters in their little world.  We didn't need to see the massacre in such detail since we now knew what happened.  There is a second hand drama from the black and white CCT images and the sparse sound that is so mundane it's creepy.
Van Sant's approach is to follow the students around as they shoot everyone in sight and as they sadistically taunt their victims, including the principal.  Since there is no concern with focusing on characters long enough to develop anything about them (thoughts, feelings) these scenes become drawn out and pointless as well.  It's all an arbitrary feeling of presentation that sucks the life and the power out of the real life events.
Since there is no character development of any kind, only fragments of people doing everyday things, all captured by Van Sant's indulgent camera, even these scenes lose some power, even when there are definite jolts from the sudden stutter of rifle fire on screen, and the long, drawn out death sequences.  It's downright offensive to so cheaply use this event for a lame attempt at an art film, complete with Beethoven on the soundtrack, another choice that indicates the filmmakers don't care about reality.  Sadly, at two moments I was reminded of other teen films, namely Carrie (the girl nervously changing in the girls' locker room) and Heathers (the triple bullimic vomiting scene in the stalls), which ruined the tone even more.
Even a good title is wasted, since the 'elephants' no one wants to see are shown as different from the other kids only with the cliched previous scenes and a distinct lack of concern for any development or honesty.  They do come off as sad and pathetic, and that's an easy and one-sided result that lesser films could achieve with ease.
Seek out Zero Day for an excellent film on high school shootings.  There is talent behind the camera and it's one of the most interesting films to use the video tape framework to tell a story.  The difference is that that film did not try and cater to an international audience with the heavyhanded pretensions of Van Sant, who looks like he's trying to make half a Larry Clark film.  Van Sant, who did coproduce Kids, should have given this project to that director.  One thing about Larry Clark, he's never boring.
This is an overrated and flat out pretensious film from a director who once made a shot by shot remake of Psycho.",1067126400,7,4518,4.735969387755102
1994054,5,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" offers no excuses, illuminates little but still has the emotional and social wallop of the discharge of a hunting rifle. Set in a high school and inspired by the Columbine shootings of 1999, ""Elephant"" depicts pieces of a day in the life of several high school students leading up to the penultimate event of the shootings.
The structure of the film is, to say the least, loose: Van Sant jumps forward and back in time so we see the same event from a number of different angles. And it is not until we see a couple of the students armed that we realize that something bad, very bad is going to happen. Van Sant's mise en scene is scattered, brightly light, all formica and vinyl tile and huge dirty windows...lots of windows.
Van Sant builds up a dreadful amount of suspense merely by the piling on of mundane scenes that get more frenzied and out of control by the minute. You know what is going to happen and god help you; you can't wait for it to start just to relieve the tension.
""Elephant"" (thusly named because of the psychologically induced big animal sitting in the midst of the high school that no one can nor wants to see) shows us what we don't want to see. It offers no answers. It leaves us stunned, eyes wide, breath short. We are moved to seek answers on our own, to offer consolation to those around us and to ourselves.",1065916800,9,1363,4.412698412698413

1994071,5,B0001EFUFK,"This film is not for everyone. It's not even for most people. The camera drifts, we swivel around and watch minute after minute of the day-to-day goings on of an ordinary high school - only it's about to change a lot.
We watch conversation after idle conversation, often from different perspectives (As I Lay Dying style), sometimes learning more and more about the complexity of these people and sometimes, not.
Things get heavy.
The pressures of life bear down, the issues get worse, things hit their boiling point, the bullets fly, the bodies drop like flies.
This film is not for everyone. There's some really heavy violence, not that Die Hard or Jack Reacher drool. Real violence. Ugly violence. Mean, meaningless violence. One has to keep in mind, this movie was a product of its time. It follows the events it's based on fairly closely. If you can't handle it, sit this one out. But don't come on here, give it one star and whine because you're a middle school teacher and your feelings were hurt. Save that crap for the PTA meeting, or your next meeting with your counselor.

Fans of: Straw Dogs, Into the Void, American Beauty, David Lynch, maybe American Psycho.

1994072,5,B0001EFUFK,"This movie shows the events leading up to a school shooting, that in itself is set up to be a bit boring, but this movie isn't.
It sits with you and makes you stare blankly as the credits roll. A lot of people are mentioning how slow it is, do any of you remember being in school? it was slow, it was boring and very cruel. I think this movie wants the killers to be portrayed as people who were bullied, not as bad as some of the others, which is why this film stands out. It show that it truly can happen anywhere, to anyone, that these killers are a lot like people we all know.  There is no real justification of what they do, and in real life, it rarely if ever makes sense.
I also want to correct some on calling this movie violent, unlike other after-school specials and even plain old violent movies, for once it doesn't solely focus on the violence. If i may be honest here, in the real world, the news reports far too much of how the killer(s) plan their spree. That promotes violence , in my opinion, more than this movie could. 'Elephant' stands out because despite being completely violent subject matter, it doesn't go fully in depth, it shows you facts, it shows you students.
It tries to show you that sometimes these so called warning signs, aren't so apparent. All in all it's a movie that does stay with you, it is slow, but i think that suites it, it shouldn't be face-paced, who-shot who, and when and why, it slows down the events and informs you, while being as vague as possible (probably like my review of it)",1425340800,,1534,4.289655172413793

1994074,2,B0001EFUFK,"Nine Things About the Movie Elephant (USA, 2003)

1. This is Gus Van Sants minimalist interpretation of a school shooting.  It was the second school shooting movie released after Columbine (that I know of).  As an indie art film, this movie is decent. As a Van Sant film, its below average. As a depiction of the circumstances surrounding a school shooting, this movie is laughably terrible.

2. The young actors did a lot of open improvising as they did their scenes. You can tell. Just like theres a certain self-conscious awkwardness to most performances, like they know they are being filmed and are trying not to look at the camera.

3.  The movie is told non-linearly, jumping back and forth in time, showing various perspectives of different high school students as they roam the hallways on the last day of their lives.

4. The cinematography is kind of impressive, using long camera shots to piece the timeline together like a puzzle. But every frame is so tightly choreographed that it backfires and makes the whole spontaneous feeling of the movie seem really staged and artificial.

5. A lot of the movie just shows people walking around, acting kind of bored with life. Even after the shooting starts, people never really seem more than mildly concerned.

6. Even though its a big school  there appear to be only 75 people in the whole building. And when they realize they are in mortal danger they run - or rather, walk more quickly - everywhere except for the exits.

7.  The propaganda component of this movie is as subtle as the Hitler film the two school shooters are watching the day before they do their thing. The shooters are smart and sensitive - the leader even plays Beethoven on the piano and quotes Shakespeare as he starts his massacre.

8.  I understand what Van Sant was trying to do with the shower kiss, but it came across as pandering and doesnt really fit with the rest of the movie.

9.  This movie could be shown to teenagers as a way to stop school violence. It makes shooting up a school seem so damn boring and pointless that kids will forget about their violent plans and go do something else.",1409961600,2,2133,4.632978723404255

1994083,5,B0001EFUFK,"I've read the non fiction book titled COLUMBINE which presented every known fact about the killings at the high schools by two seniors who went there.  i had put off seeing this movie because i thought it would present basically the same facts in the same orderly way.  but no, this film attacks COLUMBINE from an entirely different perspective.  it really is quite brilliant.

essentially we see an ordinary day in high school and follow all sorts of kids around as they make their way around the school, to the library, to the gym, to classes, to the cafeteria and so forth. the dread builds with each sauntering walk around the school as you know the two killers are coming. you are expecting the shooting to start any second and are frantically wondering which kids will end up dead. you want to shout at them to get out but they just continue meandering through the day.  these are depicted as average teenagers.  they can be very annoying and their speech patterns make you cringe.  three of the popular girls go into the bathroom and throw up after lunch. the awkward girl can barely stand to change clothes in the locker room, a drunk father drives his kid to school, the principal gives out a detention, the librarian gives shelving instructions, the cafeteria workers are in their hair nets and doling out food.  this is a small city getting on with its day.  and into that day comes violent death disrupting the entire world which goes on there.

van sant takes some artistic liberties with the film, which he also wrote.  to my knowledge, neither Harris nor Klebold were excellent classical piano players; neither of them was gay and that was not the basis of their relationship; the real Harris and Klebold looked very different from the two actors in their roles.  but this is not set up to be a documentary and it doesn't even say it is Columbine.  You just infer that from the way it unfolds.  but it very closely follows the events from the book so there is no doubt that Columbine was the model for the idea.

this was shot on location in a school in Portland, Oregon.

this is the most artistic rendering of the Columbine story which one could ever imagine.

1994084,1,B0001EFUFK,"How anyone could give this plotless wonder more than one star is beyond me.  It doesn't even warrant a whole star.  This is the most boring movie I have ever seen in my life.  The movie plods along for what seems like nearly two hours, simply following random high school kids around as they walk the hallways and engage in meaningless conversation.  If you can stay awake long enough, something does finally happen when you realize a couple of kids are planning a school shooting.  However, if you make it this far through this colossal borefest, you'll be rooting for the shooters like I was.  At least they provided a spark of interest in this otherwise pointless movie.  No reason is given as to why they go on a killing spree, even though it's mildly implied that they were bullied.  Some random kid who we know absolutely nothing about(they only introduce him by showing the word ""Benny"" on the screen) inexplicably walks calmly through the halls as chaos ensues.  Just as you think he's about to sneak up on one of the shooters and disarm him, the shooter turns around and blows him away.  So much for a plot twist.  Eventually, one shooter shoots the other for no reason at all and then catches a couple hiding in a freezer.  Just before we find out if he kills them or not, the movie abruptly ends and the credits roll, leaving the viewer both confused and thankful at the same time.  No plot, no interesting characters, no good acting, no point.....you know, all those things that typically make for a good movie.

1994085,5,B0001EFUFK,"In this social commentary set in the guise of a brutal school shooting, Gus van Sant made a film under 90 minutes long that feels like an epic. It wasn't simply timing that won the film the Palme d'Or when it premiered at Cannes, this movie is legitimately a masterpiece, and a film that says a great deal without very much dialogue.
The film follows around a cast of around 12 characters throughout its 80 minute running time, using slow tracking shots and sparse dialogue to force its audience to feel the mounting tension. While the film initially feels to be about nothing in particular other than a few high school kids walking around and taking pictures, we see from early on that something much more sinister is taking place.
It's obvious at this point that this film is not simply a metaphor for the Columbine school shooting, but heavily based on it. However, it's not made to exploit the horror of that day in Colorado, but merely to try to understand why things like this happen, and to observe the unsuspecting victims and how they react in a time of total brutality. This film does what so many films fail to do without the urgency of a conventional action film. It is because Gus Van Sant gives us so much time to breathe that the film seems so important.

1994088,1,B0001EFUFK,"This is the only movie I've seen by gus, but I can safely say this may be the last.
This movie consisted of predictable but lousily conducted ideas and multiple shots that lasted much, much longer than they needed to. The characters were boring as well.
The description on the back of the DVD case was obnoxious enough for me to steer clear entirely. I remember reading it a couple times and asking why on earth I was about to watch this. Firstly, it starts off very slow. And the middle is slow, too. The ending is the only decent part of the film, but it's still screwed up just by the overall way it was presented, edited and shot. Halfway through this movie I was so ready to get up and leave.
When one scene arose with the three girls talking (about boys and their weight) I whispered to my girlfriend watching with me ""Which one do you think is the anorexic? She thought that comment was funny because she expected that as well. but, of course, a scene following up was all three of the girls entering a bathroom and all throwing up together. It was overall just silly to me.
One scene that sticks in my mind was the lunchroom scene with the kid writing in his notebook. A girl walks up to him and asks him ""WHAT ARE YOU WRITING"" and he answers ""SOMETHING BIG. YOU'LL SEE"" (or something similar) And then the girl walks away, never to be seen again. That character was added to the story specifically to let the audience know that the kid was planning something. It's amateurish scriptwriting at best.
Why is it that every character had such monotone personalities. Most of which were one dimensional to begin with. Seems like the majority of the film was just to show how many students with crappy lives can be summed up into a single day. When it boils down to it, it's blatantly preachy in some sense. Perhaps it's about video games create killers? Was columbine a reference? The shooting was also predicted by my girlfriend, but I doubted it would end with a shooting because I thought it would be too obvious of an ending.
Maybe I would have had a better grasp on the film if my girlfriend wasn't screaming at the screen half the time. But, I think this movie has little going for itself. I did like the use of the Elephant, it made me giggle a bit.

The driving idea behind this movie hits home about 10 minutes into the film and it plateaus from there. Lots of scenes with high school teens walking around and talking about shallow stuff that teens do. We get it, Gus, you're offering a microscopic look into the simplicity of teen life, as they unknowingly await tragedy that is just around the corner. A lot of people will tell you that if you don't like this film, you were just looking for action, and violence, and that you aren't cerebral enough to appreciate a good, slow-moving, film. Let me tell you, this is not the case. Just because it's slow, doesn't make it good. If you want to see a good Columbine film, watch Zero Day- it's gripping, disturbing, and the acting was so good, some people thought they were actually showing real footage of Columbine.",1344384000,,901,4.672955974842767

1994094,1,B0001EFUFK,"This film was more confusing to follow than Inception. There were so many unnecessary cuts between different students and time frames. It felt like you were watching a montage of high school life, yet not learning a thing. As I always maintain, films without characterization disappoint me and this is no exception. The film affords no insight into the lives of any of these characters and when the actual shooting takes place, you feel indifferent, like there is no danger or emotion involved. There were times when the film tried to create tension but it confused instead. For example, there is a scene where a girl starts running past two males and you think it's because she feels unsafe but really, she is only late for her library shift. Or when the shooters are killing but the tension created prior is negated by the predictability of the camera switching back to the killer as they fire.

Another thing that really bothered me was how the first few students were presented like red herrings. I went through the first half of the film certain that the blonde male and the photographer were the killers. Until it was revealed, a long way into the film that the killers were another pair of males, who personality wise are replicates of the first two males. I guess that could be also said about the film. It was repetitive, shallow and had no message.",1320710400,,1358,4.682008368200837

The film is like a funeral for American youth.  The teens-- some obnoxious and self-concerned, some soulful, some troubled-- are all unaware that they are standing on the precipice of an abyss.  There is a sense of detachment here that is, I think, entirely appropriate.  How could they know that they were presiding over the last years of American splendor, that they were about to descend into a period of social and political turmoil?  It seems, on reflection, that the Columbine shootings were an adumbration of the dark times ahead.  Beneath the brittle surface layer of tranquility and prosperity, chaos reigned.  The dark undercurrents of the American psyche broke through to the surface.  This film is reality viewed through a mirror, darkly.",1319760000,,1045,5.034883720930233

I've read many of the reviews, and can only reiterate that high school kids are generally comfortable with their mundane lot. They talk, gossip, play the young love game, try to be good students. I didn't notice any bullying, which might've made the catharsis seem more real. I watched it casually, and it was easy to absorb the lifestyle of these kids; when the replays of certain moments happened, you knew something big was gonna happen. When Erik played the Beethoven piano music, missing lots of notes, you knew something wasn't quite right. He was gratified with it. He was a master in his own eyes. It didn't matter that we knew a lot about the kids, though, in the end, we knew much more than we wanted regarding the outcome. I challenge anyone to say that they could've presented this very simple life-style better, and the motivations of the perpetrators more simply. I was blown away.",1314662400,2,1018,4.629834254143646
1994097,1,B0001EFUFK,"When people ask me ""What's the worst movie you've--"" I say ""Elephant"" before they can finish their sentence.

I've enjoyed Gus Van Sant's work. Sometimes I thought he was a bit hit or miss. But I never thought he could make a film so masturbatory and abysmal that it's boring to almost everyone else. I really thought this film would be enjoyable.

When one mentions ""school shooting"", many things come to mind. The emotions of other students, the regret some students might feel about contributing to the shooters' social isolation, the emotions of parents, fear, a build up of some sort. Actually, thinking up all of these things is about as good as it's going to get. Much better than this film. His negligence to touch on these subjects is detestable and a failure to the art of filmmaking.

Anyone who says this film was ""hypnotic"" or ""dreamy"" was trying their hardest to not come off as the philistines they truly are.

The shots in this film are usually set up behind some pseudo-hipster with no character. Their names are given to us before we watch them walk around for a good ten or fifteen minutes and the only thoughts provoked are ""When is this going to end?"" The splitting up of time line was pretentious and with no purpose. It's as if it was done only to say ""Hey, look at this mildly intriguing thing I can do with filmmaking!"" Nothing relevant ties itself to another event. Except for the shooting at the end.

The film is called Elephant. In one scene, there's a picture of an elephant on the future-school-shooter's wall of his bedroom. Other than the idea that people are ignoring the elephant in the room when it comes to those they bully into insanity until they shoot up a school, I can't think of another (half-assed) metaphor to try and shove into this movie.

By the end of this movie, you really want your time back. Or to shoot a bunch of people involved with the making of this film and the yourself. I wish I could give it 0/5 stars.",1301702400,,1964,4.51830985915493

1994100,4,B0001EFUFK,"Even though this film was put out several years after the Columbine shooting event it is surely in response to it. It's in response to not only that shooting but any threats that followed. After the Columbine massacre there has been an increase in school security and advocates in the schools to prevent bullying. This frightening depiction of a day in the life of some fated high school students not only responds to the act of bullying towards young men in schools, but also those that are of different sexualities and the pressures of societies on young men and women of today.

The first time I watched this film I was in high school and the following day I definitely felt that haunted camera following me around. The steady cam following individuals is used throughout the film to give a sense of being within the school and being consistently watched and watchful. It's hard not to feel the pressures that the students feel. The focus on teachers or grown-ups is minimal and we rarely even see their faces. Instead we focus on a select few students, most of which become victims of the shooting that will inevitably come in the film. Two young men are victims of bullying and teasing despite the fact that they are smart, talented, and individuals with a great deal of depth. In a society where we only see the exteriors of things we are constantly looking over the interior turmoils that can happen within high school students.

A great film for those critiquing our societies and wondering how we can make our schools better. We can't have lax teachers or allow bullying to perpetuate itself. The only thing I disliked about the film was the actors. Granted, they are all young and it's an HBO Film with a limited budget, but it takes away from the film which is otherwise fantastic. A great use of photography, a haunting score, and a complex series of overlapping events to emphasize the end.

And for all of those interested as to why the film is called ""Elephant"": It goes back to an old saying of ""Elephant in the room"" which suggests that it would be impossible to ignore an elephant in a room you are residing in. Unfortunately, most people DO ignore the elephant, that is, until it rampages.",1296518400,,2208,4.641943734015345
1994101,1,B0001EFUFK,"I have had a lingering distaste for this film since I saw it some time ago. I felt that Van Sant used the Columbine tragedy as a dramatic device to add weight to what would otherwise be a blend of homoerotic scenes between neophytes and existential meditations on the banality of adolescence (starring particularly attractive adolescents). I found the vignettes of the perpetrators that offered potential explanations as to the motivations and environmental factors that led to this massacre particularly distasteful, and as vapid as the mainstream media discussion following the real life events this story is loosely based on. Were they desensitized due to violent video games? Was the access to guns too easy? Were they misunderstood by their peers? Were they gay? Did they listen to crazy music?

Dull as bricks, and offensive.

However, if you particularly enjoy looking at adolescent boys, this film may please you on some level.",1295740800,,935,5.144736842105263
1994102,1,B0001EFUFK,"When I read through the reviews of this film, I am honestly surprised to find it receiving such high praise. It makes me wonder if everyone here watched the same film that I did. The film that I watched doesn't merit more than one or two stars.

Before I launch into my review, I would like to clarify exactly what it is that I did not like about this film. My disappointment does not stem from the theme. I knew that this film was loosely based on the Columbine shooting. That is more or less the reason I watched this film. I was eager to see an indie director's take on the situation, to see which aspects would be explored, and what ""statements"" would be made about the shootings and the shooters. The reason I disliked this film so much was because I found none of that. The reason I gave this film one star out of five is because it lacked depth.

I debated giving the film two stars simply because of the style in which the film was shot. While not unique by any stretch of the imagination, it (following several individuals, showing how their lives overlap, etc) could be a very powerful film style, provided it was done right. Which it wasn't. Sure, the director showed us many of the students directly affected by the shootings, clearly at some desperate attempt to build an emotional connection between the viewer and the victims. However, I felt unable to emotionally connect with these students for several reasons. The first reason being that there was nothing to connect with. The director showed these people doing things, but it didn't offer any insight into their minds. It didn't show their emotions, how they felt about the things that they were doing and the people they were interacting with. I can't form an emotional connection with empty shells of people, and that's what we were given. However, that may not be entirely the director's fault...

...and that brings me to my second reason: the acting was HORRID. I'm not normally the type to complain about bad acting, providing the concepts behind the film are deep enough to make up for bad acting, but that is certainly not the case here. It was more than apparent that none of the cast of this film had any acting experience or ability (except for the blond-haired kid with the drunk father. He was a good actor). This is what stood between me and the students, destroying any chance of building an emotional connection. None of the actors apparently knew how to properly express emotion. The dialogue was all so very forced and rushed (we'll talk about the pacing of the film in the next paragraph), and devoid of feeling. This was most apparent once the shootings started. The gunmen were running through the school, firing indiscriminately, and none of the students/faculty could muster up anything more than nonchalance. For example, when the student participating in the homosexuality discussion (Nate, I believe?) walked to the doorway and was subsequently shot, the teacher told him to get up, talking to him as if he was just pretending to be dead (which could have been possible, considering the complete lack of entrance/exit wounds, blood on his shirt, etc). It took me a few moments to realize that the teacher was attempting to express fear, shock, etc.

Let's discuss the pacing of the film. The biggest problem with the acting, aside from being completely devoid of emotion, was the pacing. Every piece of dialogue, every line spoken or ""screamed,"" was rushed. This is not unusual among a cast of novice actors, but it is an issue that should not be observed so heavily in the finished product. I took a few drama/theater courses in middle school and high school, and pacing was the first issue addressed. Why? Because everybody has pacing issues when they first start acting (Note: I'm not trying to sound like the pompous actor who criticizes other actors - I haven't participated in any drama/theater-related activities in 5+ years, and I do not identify myself with that group of people. I'm just referencing my own past experiences with non-profession drama troupes). The director should have had the actors work on pacing prior to the final shooting of the film. In fact, I'll go so far as to say that not doing so is an inexcusable mistake on his part, and does not reflect well on his directing abilities.

Aside from the dialogue, the pacing of the film also seemed off. While most scenes seemed to drag on, without any true purpose, the film as a whole felt rushed. Again, I'll attribute this to the complete lack of depth in the film.

The movie had a lot of potential. The premise was intriguing. How could the director have done better? Here are a few things that I feel should have been explored:
1. The shooters' motivation - people don't shoot up schools because the jocks shoot spitballs at them. The oversimplification was insulting.
2. The shooters' relationship with each other - I felt like it was poorly portrayed (first they're friends, then they're lovers, then he callously pulls the trigger...)
3. What the students felt, not just what they did - It focused on the students' outward appearances, but offered nothing on the content of their minds and hearts

And that is why I give this film 1 of 5 stars.",1286236800,8,5223,4.707877461706784
1994103,4,B0001EFUFK,"Sex drugs and rock and roll was the theme in young teens in the late 50's through the 60's. In Gus Van Sant's movie Elephant he shows that some of today's young teens prefer freedom, good looks, and guns. Van Sant's Elephant is a reenactment of the shooting at Columbine High School on April 20th 1999. Van Sant's subject that he address in this film, what is wrong with today's youth?
 Is it today's youth that is the problem, or those that influence the youth? Is it the video games and violent programs on TV that have disturbed the minds of today's youth? Is it the lack of time together with family, or the mindset of the parents that my child is perfect? Perhaps it is all of these. Perhaps it is the fact that most of the youth today would rather sit at home and play first person shooter games that go outside and play. Or that majority of movies or TV shows have violence in them. The fact that some parents can't see past their own pride to notice their kids are making bombs in their garage also doesn't help. By the parents actions, and the games and TV that the youth is watching it sends a message saying behavior like this is ok. So who is it that takes the blame? Can one person or one activity take the blame? No, the finger of blame can go to anyone; it could go to companies that sell guns to anyone with a credit card, or a parent's credit card.
 The sky turns from cloudy to dark with thunder and lighting; a storm is coming. Van San't used two scenes in the movie of the sky, one before the massacre and one after the massacre. David from Chapel Hill North Carolina believed that the changing of the skies meant the passing of time. While it does show the light to dark and back to light, like the passing of the day, it take two different scenes for that to happen. The scene before the massacre appears to be the day and night before. This is where the ""storm"" comes. And then the scene after the massacre, the clouds begin to dissipate and out comes the sun; all is calm.
 ""One thing Van Sant refuses to do is try to 'explain' why the killers act as they do"" according to Ronald E Zwick. By giving more background Van Sant would have given more of an explanation. However Van Sant only shows one scene that may have led to the unexplained actions of Dylan and Eric. The scene is in science class when Dylan's classmates are calling him names and spitting spit balls at him. This is the only background Van Sant gives of the torment the two boys endured on a daily basis.
 Van Sant uses a certain POV angle for most of the shoots. It appears as if the viewer is actually there living and feeling the emotions the characters are. Most of the scenes the camera is in front or behind the character and hearing the side conversations come and go as the character walks. The wide camera angles when the character turns corners allow seeing a larger picture of what the character is seeing, like a detached observer.
 With the use of ""detached observer"" camera angles, imagery of the skies, and the suspense and need for the viewer wanting more, Van Sant is able to create a film deserving of a Golden Palm at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Van Sant created a film that at times is difficult to watch, but is an eye opening experience to all viewers. The film shows how different violent programs or care free attitudes can have a large, sometimes negative, affect on today's youth.",1284940800,,3400,4.356466876971608

Kid shuffles solo across the gym floor.  Scene.

Unfortunately, this isn't a zombie movie, and that's how the first half of the movie drags on.  Shot in uninteresting bursts of wandering, meandering, and meaningless dialogue (it felt like watching The Hills), the framing of the shots isn't bad, but the directing is clearly amateur.  I suppose one could conclude the shots have something to do with the isolated feeling of awkward, pubescent high school years, but that's a weak cop-out.

The cast is very young and fresh, providing a solid performance.  None really stand out from the others, but they're all competent.  It's like being a fly on the wall in High School.  It's just that the script is incredibly boring and slow.  This movie is nearly guaranteed ennui.  The character development is absolutely nonexistent.  It's silent film nonexistent.  There is insignificant explanation of why the kids snap.

The score is pretentious and completely distracts from whatever message is being unconvincingly delivered.  The best music of the movie is when one of the troubled kids plays Beethoven's Fur Elise.

Children today have weak constitutions; their psyche has become fragile from years of coddling, undeserved affirmations, an entire lifetimes of being told that everyone is a winner, everyone is a special, unique butterfly.  Well, guess what?  Life often sucks, and it's better to overcome fears, difficulties, and struggles with determined will power and thicker skin.  Sticks and stones, people.  Therein lies the problem with Elephant.  Instead of playing the ""these kids are so depressed, alone, and have such hard lives""-card, maybe something positive could have been presented for them to latch on to.  Rather than a justification for horrible, unforgivable, cowardly actions, maybe an alternative could have been presented.

Simply put, the film is incomplete and flawed.  The first act fails to create interest, the second act fails to build upon it, and the third act provides no resolution.  It is literally the most boring movie I've ever seen.

1994105,4,B0001EFUFK,"ELEPHANT (2003) is an oddly incomplete movie.

Yes it's interesting to see this one school day from several points of views and the young actors are all very good, yet there's some real flaws here.

For one, the two shooters casually wander the halls and pick off victims at random. An awful lot of time passes during their stalk and the police never arrive. Is this at all possible in an age of cellphones?

What are the motivations of the dark-haired killer? We know he practices Beethoven sonatas and watches Hitler documentaries and that he and his friend briefly experiment with each other in the shower, but what has made him such a sociopath? Obviously, in a 90 minute film you can't go into too much depth on every character's life, but shouldn't more focus have been placed on events that led to bomb and weapons stockpiling and assault plans carried out with deadly results?

Then, the story has no resolution. (SPOILERS AHEAD)

The two boys reunite in the cafeteria after their individual killing sprees. One shoots the other at point-blank range, then searches the kitchen's walk-in freezer, corners a young couple and plays eeny-meenie-miney-moe with them as the camera pulls back. Cut to a cloudy sky, roll credits.

That's an ending?

Finally and most importantly, for the vast majority of viewers this film will be accepted as what it is, a depiction of tragedy. Whether such gruesomely unpredictable violence is avoidable can be debated. Of real concern is that a troubled kid may watch this and use it as a primer to launch his own school attack. This is more possible than we perhaps care to accept or imagine.

ELEPHANT is imperfect but is eminently watchable, despite no lessons learned or moral to the story.",1274832000,,1730,4.820945945945946
1994106,5,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant's Elephant covers the timely and terrible topic of school shootings. Inherently provocative, it's nonetheless the best film we could imagine about such a thing. Van Sant chooses to present the story using pure ultrarealism, with absolutely no embellishment or explanation. No one is afforded any cinematic villainy, heroism or redemption - though there are, one could argue, moments of all three. In the end, however, you are left with the same questions you might have had in the beginning.

Yet it's also a beautiful film - filmed in gloriously wide aperture (we think?) with gloriously sensitive film, Gus Van Sant's technical skills give brilliance to mundane real life. Before the two shooters enter the doors, we follow them - and a number of other students - as they pass through the labyrinthine halls, their homes, their parents' cars and live their daily lives. It would be easy to label them according to a Breakfast Club menu of teen types: the sensitive photographer Elias (Elias McConnell), the trio of bulimic cool girls (Brittany Mountain, Jordan Taylor and Nicole George), the football player (Nathan Tyson) and his girlfriend (Carrie Finklea), and the charismatic, peroxide-blond John (John Robinson). But these are just the labels we choose to apply; there's barely any dialogue, characterization is at best opaquely hinted at, and most scenes feature only the muted murmurs of passing students, the clatter of closing lockers and the squeak of sneakers on linoleum floors. We spend much of the film following these characters back and forth during their typical day, and we frequently replay the same moments from several viewpoints. In the end, we have an overarching portrait of an average, large, American high school. Everything is then swiftly destroyed in the final twenty minutes, but even that destruction is muted, removed, difficult to follow and therefore terrifying. It could be anywhere, because it looks like everywhere.

One or two moments satisfy stereotypical movie criteria - there's a relatively thin narrative arc surrounding John and his drunken dad - but mostly the film is meditative and exposition-free. The two shooters, Alex (Alex Frost) and Eric (Eric Deulen), are enigmatic. While there is a token scene of bullying for Alex, as well as some ambiguities regarding their relationship, the psychological complexities are never explicitly explored. We never quite understand why they choose to do what they do. We can only watch them as they prepare.

And perhaps that's the film's only condemnatory note: when Alex and Eric lazily browse the Internet and order a gun, we couldn't help but feel activist alarm about American gun control. This will not do! But we can let that debate rest for another day, the film itself provides no argument. Indeed, apparently Gus Van Sant intended the title to refer to the parable of several blind men describing an elephant by feeling its individual parts: in the end, they variously describe the elephant as being like a drain pipe, a fan, a pillar or a throne, based on which part of the elephant they touched. Similarly, the film presents one event through various prisms. Yet even composing all this observational evidence together, we still don't understand the elephant at all.

1994107,1,B0001EFUFK,"""Elephant"" is an American drama filmed in 2003,  a stark and sad movie of high school relationships.  So much film is wasted following students around walking from class to class or just walking off a field, the first half seems like a high school student's film project.  There are short stories for a few of the students, and all the film stars are non-professional, just everyday kids.  There is no story, and ""Elephant"" must refer to the saying ""The Elephant in the Room"" -  The long filming of walking and retaking a scene from another perspective tries to give the viewer a feel that they are in an ordinary high school, unaware of the anger of a student who feels ""bullied"".  This student is shown in Chemistry or a Physics class at the back of the room with other students throwing spitballs at him.  He is different, a classical pianist of great talent, but angry,  ordering guns from a mail order firm and practicing his aim in the garage woodpile.  He and his brother watch old World War II documentaries on Hitler and his thugs.

Towards the last part of the movie, ""Elephant"" shows them walking together into the high school with full hunting gear.  Then like the Columbine slaughters, they kill fellow students and teachers for no real reason.  They are emotionless unless they cannot find someone to kill -  then they get angry until they find a target.  They have planned and mapped out the halls, cafeteria and Library to hunt.  There is no remorse just the thrill of killing for killings sake.

""Elephant's"" slaughter scenes are emotionless and pointless to watch.  This is just a regurgitation of the sad pointless slaughter at Columbine.",1270512000,,1657,4.7377622377622375
1994108,4,B0001EFUFK,"A powerful testament to how the world can go upside down at any moment and how unexpected life is, Elephant portrays the events at Columbine High School. Yet, that school is never mentioned and, really, these events could've taken place everywhere at any time. The movie starts off deliberately slow and follows each character as they go about their mundane daily tasks; the camera never leaves each character, switching only between characters. The value of these ordinary moments is given even higher priority when one realizes that the movie is only 1.5 hrs long. The normalcy of the tasks is so boring, in fact, that one almost screams for something more to happen. Shamefully, it does and that's when the movie truly manages to astonish the viewer. The shootings are overwhelming, of course, but it's the raw nature of their portrayal and the unapologetic nature of the characters that shocks the viewer. Unlike other movies, Elephant doesn't want to provide excuses or lay blame; instead, the movie carefully plays out the events in the schools eyes, through characters familiar and newly-introduced characters in the last moments of their lives. The movie's impact is simply undeniable - one can't help but look with apprehension and a further confusion as to the actual proceedings of the tragedy in real life.",1256515200,,1318,5.0504587155963305
1994109,2,B0001EFUFK,"Maybe this movie just wasn't what I expected.  I expected a day in the life of a typical high school, during which I get to know different students and try to look for clues about who might feel tortured enough to drive them to the inevitable tragedy we know is coming.

I never felt like I really got to know or care about many of the students featured in the movie.  Most of the time the camera is on the back of their heads, following them as they walk around (for full minutes at a time...it became not only boring, but comical).  This may be useful for depicting the day as typical, but it's not great for helping the audience understand the characters.  I felt the use of interwoven story lines to be much more interesting.  Still, many of the interactions don't shed much light on the characters either.  It didn't help that most of the acting was so poor.  (Most of the actors were amateurs, and it shows.)  When we reach the school shooting scenes, any emotion is due more to the graphic nature of the killings than any attachment to specific characters.

You can tell pretty early on who the culprits will be.  There are no conclusions as to why they did it (a move called ""gutsy"" by many reviewers...to me it seemed more like a cop out).

Ultimately, this movie is an hour of watching people walk around, followed by a graphic reenactment of Columbine.",1242259200,,1363,4.451612903225806
1994110,1,B0001EFUFK,"This is why I think this movie is trash (sorry, I am usually very reserved).

1.  Pretentious
2.  No characterization
3.  Lack of psychological insight

I rented this movie based on Gus Van Sant's reputation and the synopsis attracts me.  I do not rate this movie one star because it couldn't live up to its promise, but because everything is done wrong.

The direction is what you'd call an art house movie.  But an ""art"" ought to get someone to think, and this one doesn't.  The movie is a juxtaposition of various pretty pictures without some coherent meaning.

Maybe I just don't get it.  Example, when John slapped his butt for a photo shoot, it was ingenious the first time, but after the third time, it gets old.  In poetry, if a message is repeated, it must mean something or to reinforce some idea.  But I'm sorry, I don't get how John slapped his own butt is a symbol of anything.  Bottom line: cut the crap out in the editing room.

Whoever did the music design ought to be guillotined.  Why Moonlight Sonata?  How does it enhance the mood of the movie?  But none of that really matter as long as it does not overrides the background ambiance, which brilliantly brings out the atmosphere of the school, whereas the music score falls short on it.  Discordance, yes, but why do it when John entered the school.  Was he the villain who disrupts the school?  Incorrect usage of motif.  F for music design.

Given Gus Van Sant's reputation is built on gay coming of age story, I don't blame him for choosing some nice looking boys in his movies (though I think it's a little exploitative a la Andy Warhol).  But what is their purpose in the movie if their characters are not developed?  Was John a hero?  Were Eric and Alex villains or anti-heroes?  No clear sense of direction....  What's Eric's and Alex's motive to go on a rampage?  Were they bullied?  I didn't see that in the movie, but I get the cue maybe John was and was misunderstood by the principal.  Why didn't he go on a rampage?  Erm..., maybe because people don't snap like that easily?  Why Columbine and other school massacres happened?  Did production team discuss any of the possibilities why Alex and Eric would want to kill people like that?  Did they ask the young actors who played the roles?  This is not a pretty picture with no substance, is it?  (sorry, that's a rhetorical question)

The characterization is as vague as the question, are Alex and Eric gay?  You get to see them kiss, but you don't know if they are gay or not.  Maybe it's just a goodbye kiss, or maybe they're just emos without the makeup.  If they were lovers, how could Alex kill Eric like that?  If they were bullied in school and depend on each other to cope with the situation, how COULD they do that?  Characterization:  F minus.

A movie like this should offer possible explanation that'll get people to think about the issue, and this one merely feeds the public with preexisting stereotype.  It contains no psychological insight as to why bad things happened.  This is NOT art.  This is pretension.",1241049600,,3058,4.5451197053407

Elephant is an adequate sit down and watch movie, however some people will become bored with it, there are many many scenes of people just walking, all have significance but that might drain some people after a while, there really isn't much talking in this movie. There's also some background political agenda crap going on here, take for example the kids order guns online and a movie equivalent to Fedex just delivers them to these two kids. Which if you know anything about firearm transfers, you'd know that no one can directly receive a firearm through a courier service (including the mail) unless they are licensed dealers and have loads of proof and trust me, those kids would not be able to trick a licensed dealer into thinking they themselves are dealers to get those guns delivered to them. They also received ammo with the guns they received, which is further political BS because ammo cannot legally be shipped with firearms. I suppose if you want to overlook politics you could claim poetic license, like the scene in which one of the boys opens up a box he just received with a Bushmaster Carbon 15 rifle and just test fires it in his garage as if the police wouldn't arrive swiftly to his home or something firing off a rifle in his garage. I don't get the focus on the blond kid on the front of the DVD cover either, the movie followed him and the trouble with his either drunk or burned out (I couldn't tell which) father but it wasn't really significant, the two kids that did the actual shooting when going into the building told him to 'get out of here' similar to Eric Harris telling Brooks Brown to 'get out of here' before the Columbine school shooting, but the blond kid wasn't a friend of the shooters in this film so it didn't really do anything other than serve as a similarity to the Columbine school shooting. But overall the movie is ok, certainly not great. I think the movie Zero Day is a little bit better, you get to know the characters better in Zero Day and it's a bit easier to watch. The fact also that they made the two shooters gay was a little strange and irrelevant to the plot as well and really had no need in the film other than to kill two minutes.",1228780800,,2378,4.757869249394673

1994114,5,B0001EFUFK,"Utterly uncompromising, I gave ""Elephant"" five stars for Gus Van Gus Van Sant's simple, straightforward & realistic approach to a Columbine-like shooting (so be forewarned) and his refusal to comfort the viewer with easy moralizing, in an effort (I think) to let viewers react, think and come to their own conclusions.  Sant also earns extra points for setting the stage with restraint and for steadfastly refusing to sensationalize his material, even after the violence has started.  The result is one of the most effective of the generally provocative, often exploitive depictions of 'self-destructive youth' I've seen as of late (a virtual genre today, recent examples including Argento's ""The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things,"" Greg Araki's ""Mysterious Skin,"" and Larry Clark's ""Bully,"") - all the more so for his understatement.",1225497600,,836,5.423076923076923
1994115,4,B0001EFUFK,"It's no surprise that the reviews on Amazon.com are bimodal - many reviewers think this is a great film, others hate it.  The professionals summarised on Rotten Tomatoes are similarly divided.  You'll notice that I said ""think it's a great film"", not ""loved the film"".  There is a difference.  It's hard to ""love"" a film that moves this slowly and has such a grim subject matter.  For about an hour, Gus van Sant simply follows students through empty hallways and filled cafeterias.  The chronology is somewhat confusing, as he give no clues when switching between people about the progression of the day - is the football practice in the morning?  Lunch?  What about the photographer - when is he developing the film?  To say that the film is maddening at the beginning is an understatement.  The viewer will have to be patient and watch, just as van Sant's camera watches, to see what the filmaker had in mind.

Then comes the shootings.  They are brutal and pathetic.  Again, it must be a deliberate choice by van Sant that the first victim is an even bigger ""loser"" (on the high school social scale) than the shooters.  This is what makes the shooters pathetic - they are not out for revenge, they have no statement to make, i.e. they are so pathetic they can't even formulate a reason why they are killing people.  Are real high school shooters like this?  Is there any way to rationalise such actions (for us or for the shooters themselves)?  Van Sant seems to suggest that there is not.

The film is skillfully made - the takes are long (several minutes without cuts).  The actors are believeable (even if the school is not - where are all the students of this school?  It looks like it's only 1/4 filled to capacity).  The method of presentation is thought-provoking.  The film will not sit well with people that are looking for answers (or even questions).  Sometimes there simply are no answers, and van Sant does not cheapen his film by trying to provide them.  It's a brave presentation, but I think the right one for this subject matter.",1224806400,,2050,4.646239554317549
1994116,4,B0001EFUFK,"In 2003 (or a few years before perhaps), Gus Van Sant got drunk on Bela Tarr films, which is a great intoxicant.  Tarr is a giant in cinema today, and his films are masterpieces of light, shadow, photography, acting, and some of the most extraordinary camerawork ever in cinema.  Gus made two films with an obvious debt to Tarr, Gerry and this film, Elephant.  Elephant is the better of the two films.

Elephant has an eerie, haunting, etheral quality to it as Gus's camera glides through the high school.  He shows high school life to be tedious, silly, heartless, sad, occasionally funny, and eventually violent, as Gus emulates the Columbine massacre at the end of the film (even though very little violence is actually shown).  While the film isn't perfect, it's light years better than Gerry, which is a very misguided attempt to emulate Bela Tarr's style and substance (Van Sant got the style, but missed the substance).  Both Gerry and Elephant have improvised dialogue, and it's a major drawback to both films, but more so with Gerry.  Elephant's dialogue is forgettable, but luckily there's not much of it.  Much of the film isn't told with dialogue but with glances and wide shots, and Van Sant uses these tools quite effectively.  He also makes haunting use of Beethoven's Fur Elise, one of Beethoven's most famous works.  The film has a slow pace, but it's good for the material.
Elephant is a good chapter in the Van Sant catalog, which has masterpieces (My Own Private Idaho), misguided films (Gerry), and absolute garbage (his remake of Pyscho).",1222819200,,1560,4.849056603773585
1994117,2,B0001EFUFK,"This film is as disturbing a film about high school shootings as can be made.  Director Gus van Sant tracks two boys who ultimately decide the only way they can cope with life is to shoot up their school.  As if this isn't bad enough, the final scenes more or less glorify the act by not showing how the surviving boy (after he shoots his co-consprator) ends up.  Presumably he shoots two more students in a kitchen freezer but we don't know.

This film is very disturbing and most movie-goers will not appreciate any part of it.  How can a movie have entertainment value when it raises the question of will this happen at the schools our children go to?  The film doesn't really show anything that might prevent a school shooting, and at no time in the film are any police arriving or distraught parents gathering in the parking lot.  What I found most distasteful was when the one boy told the other to most of all ""have fun"" while systematically slaughtering innocent classmates and school staff.

Meanwhile, reading the poor reviews of this movie (and I agree with them all for the most part), there was something I picked up on that no one else seemed to.  The lack of any real plot, the actual reason I believe the director didn't get into the ""lives"" and ""depth"" of the students, is because he wanted you to sympathize with the shooters.  He purposely showed just enough of these people, the hazing, the bad parenting, the oblivious teachers... to make you dislike them.

At the end of the day (or lunch as the case may be), the shooters were only striking back at their tormentors, their parents, and their ""mentors"" who were supposed to help them and looked the other way.

I don't condone such acts obviously, but I do insist that PARENTS be more involved with their children, and the people who are supposed to be looking out for their children while they're in school.  Would it kill you to ask your kid ""how was your day?"", ""are you being helped when you need it?"", and most of all ""are you being bullied?""

I also insist you skip this movie.  If you feel the need to watch it, there's a 2 minute scene where the blonde shooter is explaining to the Principal he didn't deserve to live because he looked the other way, refused to help him when he complained, offered to let him live (""go now before I change my mind""), then shot him in the back.

We get the notion that today is a typical day in high school, but as soon as the two students in black arrive, our hearts sink, and we know it's going to be chaotic. The thing I love most about this film is the rare talent shown by Alex Frost; he was subtle enough to keep me involved and afraid of him, and fragile enough to let me sympathize with him.

Thanks to movie and tv content if not real life experience, children of high-school age know what gunshots sound like.
Most individuals of any age would have enough sense to put their head down, run away, or hide.
I do not believe that the average high-schooler is as stupid as this film portrays them to be.

At no time would the killers under U.S. law have been able to obtain firearms in the manner that is depicted.

1994124,5,B0001EFUFK,"As everybody knows, this film was inspired by the Columbine High School Massacre that took place in Columbine, Colorado, 1999.

The film does not have a classic plot. It simply follows the last minutes of a group of high school kids before two of them enter the school ""armed to the teeth"" and start shooting anything that moves. Some of them get killed. Some will survive.

Simple as that.

But the film is more than JUST that.

FIRST, it is a very inventive narrative exercise as we follow several characters' point of view whose path crosses other characters' paths we previously have seen. At one time, you'll get the idea the screenplay is constructing a big puzzle that will only be complete when the shooting begins - which it does.

SECOND, I found those characters fascinating. Even without a plot, Gus Van Sant is able to touch us with the unique experience of some characters. The first five minutes or so, when John (played by the beautiful John Robinson), a kid whose father seems to be an alcoholic, cries without knowing why is very eloquent and clear about the unseen inside of those characters.

THIRD, there is an ambiance of... it's hard to describe... loneliness, isolation, inner disorder... that we only find in the best horror/thriller films. And strangely enough we find it here, in a film like this (not horror nor a thriller). In fact, I believe anyone interested such genres, should take a look at this film and be amazed.

FOURTH: the film really gets your attention in the end, when the whole thing happens... randomly, unexpectedly...

In retrospect, I think this is one the most important works of the decade and, in a certain way, it says a lot about today's youth in America: beautiful when it's beautiful and really monstrous when it goes downhill.

As a non-American (I'm in Europe), two scenes stuck me like lightning (for obvious reasons): the one when the three girls go vomit after lunch (I wasn't expecting that one! - laughs) and the one where two boys order a fire weapon by mail and get their kicks from shooting chopped wood in a garage.

* a popular prep and his girlfriend
* an introspective student photographer

In light of the recent shootings around America (one of which took place at my college a few months ago), the subject matter is extremely painful to watch. I cannot recommend this film to everyone, but for those wanting to see another view as to how these things transpire and why, Elephant offers a bit more into that realm.

My complaints are that it moves a little slowly, this perhaps due to my fascination with action films and fight scenes, but I suppose that is part of the point. It's a slow, dramatic build to shocking horror of the most realistic variety.

The film jumps around a bit, showing us different characters from their perspectives and it's kind of interesting how they cross paths and interact, and how their fates are seemingly plucked from a hat at random.

All the kids in the film seemed fresh, young and energetic. They are all unknowns which I think makes them more anonymous, more the feeling that they could be anyone or anyone's children. It also shocks us that those same innocents can be capable of such raw violence and hatred.

To me, it goes to show that this 'socialization' we peddle as 'education' isn't work a damn. In many children it does more harm then good, and in many more sets them up as narcisists and/or psychopaths in training. Homeschooling anyone?",1208736000,6,1160,4.873096446700508

1994130,4,B0001EFUFK,"This is one of those rare occasions where a film's strengths ultimately become its weaknesses.  There is something so graceful and serene about `Elephant' that you can't help but admire Gus Van Sant's approach to the direction, but in the end that same serene feeling can leave the viewer almost apathetic to the tragic outcome and thus dampens the emotional punch the film should deliver.

As the film opens with beautiful cinematography, graceful and simple clean sweeps across the school campus, you can't help but be drawn into this presentation.  It's almost so lucid it's compelling.  There is no depth to the sequences, everything is just so normal.  The characters are ordinary.  They talk about girls and boys and photos and shopping and four-wheeling.  They converse about nothing and accomplish nothing.  They're vapid and apathetic.  In essence they are human.  This is a strength in that the characters appear human.  We feel as though we know them, maybe we are them.  Not every film has to be filled to the brim with characters that have emotional problems for family problems or out of the norm situations.  Yes, one character is obviously shy and introverted and self conscious about her body and one character obviously has some family problems but neither of these issues is exploited for our sympathies.  This same `strength' becomes a major weakness as the film starts to dwindle down to its climax.  These characters are so transparent that their tragic demise doesn't really faze the viewer.  I know that sounds harsh, and let me say that the final moments of the film are heartbreaking, but they don't have a lasting impression.  When the film ended I simply rolled over and went to sleep.  The same graceful approach to the direction also begins to weaken the film in the closing moments.  Instead of tightening the reigns and thrusting the viewer into the violence full throttle they are left to witness everything in a very calm and simple manor.  It leaves the viewer almost detached from the crimes instead of a part of it.

But then again, maybe that is the whole point...

I think that's why I'm torn with this film.  It lies somewhere between cinematic masterpiece and art-house overshot.  I can't tell if it's trying too hard or not trying hard enough, or maybe the impression of effortlessness is not an impression at all but truly an effortless creation.  The simplicity of the film is either welcomed magnificence or frustrating indifference; it's all a matter of how you look at it.

It's quite possible that we are supposed to feel nothing with the credits begin to roll.  It's quite possible that the purpose behind `Elephant' is to prove that tragedies of this magnitude happen so often we as a culture have grown callused to it.  If that is the case then consider this a marvelous example of enlightening cinema.

It's also quite possible that that is not the intention at all.

In the end `Elephant' is a film that I think everyone needs to see at least once.  It's not a film that anyone can tell you is good or bad because it all comes down to personal connection in the end.  Everyone is going to react differently to this film depending on their own interpretation of the meaning behind it.  In a way this is the films largest strength/weakness.  It suffers in that it reaches a smaller demographic because of its avant-garde production but it soars in that the demographic it does reach; the loyally devoted fans of this film; will embrace it as perfection and thus laud it as a marvelous contribution to the world of cinema.",1204761600,3,3572,4.782679738562091

1994139,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant is an understated, incredibly haunting film account of how the day of the Columbine shootings might have progressed.

With long, amazingly detailed and subtle steadicam shots (most several minutes in length), director Gus Van Sant follows his cast of characters through their typical daily school lives. Although some reviewers may call this tactic ""boring"", I think they're missing the point entirely. This isn't a subject or a story that requires quick cuts and shaky character development to tell.

What Van Sant manages to do is to show, in a beautifully tragic way, just how ordinary the school day was, and how surprising and explosive the events really were or could be.

Following the long shots, at several points overlapping from different angles and different characters, the audience begins to create a visual image of all the activity occuring on a school campus at any given time. The understated performances by all the young actors add another layer of perfection to the film by making it all feel painfully realistic.

When the shooting finally does start, in the last 10 minutes of the film, it's almost like the viewer has been lulled into a false sense of security, much like the students in the school have been. Overall, this film is terrifically and tastefully done and it's definitely worth watching whether you're interested in Columbine or not. Elephant is just good filmmaking.

The DVD is 2-sided with the feature on one side and special features on the other. The special features are pretty weak. There's a making of featurette, but it's pretty much the worst making of I've ever seen. There's no discussion from the director on what he was trying to do or say, there's a few different cast members describing what their definition of violence is... other than that it's just shots of them making the film.",1177459200,8,1845,4.957928802588997

The unfolding of the pointless mayhem is told in interweaving, elegant hand held camera style, all very collegiate in concept, and, really, in intellectual content. Van sant falls for the old gag of content being held in contempt by form, or art for art's sake. Dangerous stuff when you play a nihilistic hand in dealing with nihilistic, adolescent behaviour. There  simply isn't sufficient depth, no explanatory power in this cheap entertainment. Get the scene of the killer kids lounging in the bedroom. Blondey looks at his computer game which displays rear-view figures and takes them out in turn.

However, if you have a low tolerance for tear-your-eyes-out-monotony: Fair warning. There are scenes in ""Elephant"" that will leave you blind. These scenes begin shortly after the opening credits and continue for approximately 80 minutes.

I had some hope when it started out: Sounds from a playground accompanied a time-lapse shot of clouds moving past. Then we see a scene where an obviously-drunk driver is attempting --poorly-- to navigate a Mercedes up a tree-lined street. The passenger, a high-school kid, demands that his drunk dad pull over: HE'LL drive the remainder of the way to school.

We get to school. There are about 9 people milling around. The school consists of multiple buildings sprawled on a lush campus that appears to be the size of Delaware. There are perhaps 17,000 classrooms. Most are empty. The few kids we see are staggeringly annoying.

Then the movie's director takes us on the first of many, many, oh-my-god-WAY-too-many Steadicam shots, as we follow oh-so-closely behind some student as he--or she---or they---walk from one end of the campus to the other, passing through 853 buildings on the way.

Then we get to meet some new annoying people. And the blond kid (the one with the drunk dad), leaves...just a half hour after he arrives. He goes outside and briefly plays with a border collie.

****ASIDE: I remember MY High School Days... they ALWAYS kept a fresh supply of border collies, labrador retrievers and beagles on campus, just in case we got the urge to duck out of class and play with a dog.  END ASIDE****

Yeah. Right. Anyway, by the last half hour, I was HOPING someone would get shot.

Did it mean that this was just a routine day, and that you can't predict or prevent such senseless and murderous acts? Maybe. But maybe it would have been a better movie if we actually were drawn in enough to care about the victims. I didn't care. They were cardboard cutouts.  The shooters were essentially enjoying target practice. As one of them said to the other shortly before the bloodshed began: ""most importantly: have fun!""

The reality is that you CAN predict who the shooters might be. In ""Elephant,"" we see a couple of ""quiet, brooding"" kids  ...and one of them has food thrown on him in the cafeteria. SHOOTER. There's also a girl. A  homely, talks-to-no one, uncomfortable-in-her-own-skin loner. *NOT* a shooter. (Here's a clue. She's a girl... girls aren't shooters.)

So I guess the laughable irony here is that this artsy-fartsy movie that is so raved about by people who would likely be APPALLED by real-life profiling, is actually an argument *for* profiling... because the perps sure fit ""the profile"" as it is often assumed to be.

It's obviously a reference to Columbine murders and while some people are saying that you can't relate to the characters much, I think they come across pretty well. it accomplished a lot on what looks like a modest low budget.

The part i liked most about the film was the fact that it didn't have alot of hollywood action explosion and gunfire and people flying through window and all that sort of nonsense. it was probably the rawest form of action you could see. gunshots sound like guns....not cannons. and i think that that counts when your trying to sell this movie as an actual event such as it was.",1172448000,6,897,4.155172413793103
1994145,1,B0001EFUFK,"I really feel that you get almost as much out of watching this movie as you do reading the summary on the back of the DVD case, because there's nothing more to it than that.  Some kids go to school.  Some other kids go to school with guns.  Some people get shot.  Some people don't.  Roll credits.

It starts out promisingly enough;  one kid is trying to get to school but his father, who is driving, is drunk, and the kid has to take the wheel.  You get the sense that you are going to learn more about this character and his family.  But you don't.  Then you are introduced to the photography student and you get a sense that you will also be learning more about this character.  But you won't.  Some more students are shown throughout the movie, most of whom are having mundane conversations or doing mundane things.  We learn very little, if anything, about any of them.  Just as we learn very little about the killers or their motivations.  We can make guesses about all of these characters from what little background we are given, but it's almost impossible to care about any of them.  I don't feel sad when I see some of these people being killed, because all I have learned about them is the way that they walk.  The only reason I have paid attention to the way that they walk is because most of them are shown walking down the hall and doing nothing else for excruciatingly long scenes.  See the photography student walk down the hall.  See the blond kid walk down the hall.  See the couple walk down the hall.  Why?  Is there something profound to be learned by closely examining the gait of high school students?  Is there something profound to be learned by watching the back of one of the killer's heads as he plays Fur Elise for a full five minutes?  Is that a dandruff flake I see, or is that just my eyes glazing over?

Perhaps the saddest and most frustrating thing about this movie is that no one reacts to the shooting realistically; in fact, it's about as nonchalant as the rest of the film.  You watch one kid walk down the hall for an eternity, then walk up directly behind the killer, saying nothing, not even appearing as though he has any intention of doing ANYTHING to the killer OR to save himself, and then he gets shot. You see a few other kids scurrying around, but you really don't see a lot of people leaving.  I don't know about you, but if I were minding my own business and I suddenly heard gunshots and screams, I would probably find somewhere else to be.

To me, this film is a classic example of modern art.  Paint a canvas completely black, call it something like ""Memoirs of Death,""  hang it at a gallery, listen to people gush about its meaning, sell it for a million bucks.  This is the movie version of that painting. Yes, I understand what the point of the movie is SUPPOSED to be.

In short, after being a cutting edge film watcher for many, many years I have to summerize this way - this file is a waste of time and even damaging to our youth.

There are two problems with this file. First of all, while the author thought he would cause us to experience character development, the opposite happens. This file uses the first whole hour to follow kids down corridors without any dialog. It's painfully slow. And almost nothing is learned about the lives of these kids who, after are young adults and complicated persons in their own right. All of that is ignored by the absence of dialog.

Secondly, no atempt is made to show how the boys in this film evolved to become who they are. They are just ""thrown"" into the script. It does nothing to deal with the real problem about horrible school shootings and why they occur. Instead, it almost, unintentionally, glorifies them.

I give this file a big thumbs down. God forbid some sicko kido sees this and decides that he too wants to shoot all of the kids in the shool.

We follow long shots of students going through their day, developing film, eating in the cafeteria, etc.  There is a real mix of actors who make it seem very life-like.  However, we need to wade through a lot to get to the promised bang at the end.  The absence of an explanation for what motivates Alex to plan this is perhaps the only way it could be handled.  We see Alex lives in a house where his parents are like absentee landlords.  There appears to be little supervision or interaction.  Moreover, there does not seem to be much love.  When Alex, played by Alex Frost in his only film role I could find, showers with his friend Eric played by Eric Deulen, it seems like maybe at least the boys have found someone to whom they could relate.  However, Alex proves to be a master manipulator.  The scene at the end where his buddy shows up to report on all his kills and receives a bullet to the chest is chilling.  However, this school is strange.  There are empty halls.  Shots ring out and the instructor appears oblivious until he drags a dead student back into the room smearing a blood trail behind him.  I know that this subject is a difficult one.  Nevertheless, I found the film to lack sensitivity and certainly it lacked heroes.  Diane Keaton produced this Gus Van Sant-directed film.

i strongly believe, and am very confident that this movie was made so that everyone could see, learn, and prevent a school shooting from happening. i look at this film of more as an educational video, or almost from a documentary standpoint. this movie was not meant to sell out theaters and make millions, i think that's where people go wrong.

i don't think this movie deserves anything below a 4 star rating. it is highly detailed, disturbing, and very educational. i think everyone needs to see this movie to fully understand these tradjec events we've ALL heard of. i respect gus van sant, no one else was really making these kinds of movies, but he stepped up to the plate, and i believe he was very successful. yeah, the movie isn't the best quality. but it wasn't suppose to be.

I agree that the young black man walking nonchalantly walking through the halls as he walks past dead bodies, hears the sounds of gunshots and sees kids running for their lives out of the schools and then he sees one of the shooters, nonchalantly walks up to him and is instantly shot, instead of leaving the school to save his own life or walking up to the shooter and trying to talk the shooter into putting down his weapon is stupid and preposterous. It makes no sense at all and I still can't figure out why they put that character in there. No one would do something like that unless they were completely insane.

1994151,5,B0001EFUFK,"I think I was in the right space now for watching the film, for I found it beautifully filmed, well acted, and altogether insightful in its experimental approach to the violence underlying western American culture in the present day.  In the wake of Columbine and other high school shootings, today's kids live in an atmosphere of fear, and sudden death spares no one, not even the most beautiful and stylish.  I guess high school has always been about fear (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER had it right), but add guns to the mixture and you have a situation in which the bullied can finally strike back.  Va Sant takes a measured approach to this quasi-revolutionary thesis, doubling back again and again from a crucial hallway confrontation (between Eli and John, as Eli takes what might be the very last photo ever taken of the lad) as if to prohibit us from deciding that aha, that's why they did it!

So that we keep seeing this apparently simple scene more than once, not on a rote basis either, but the film returns to it at unexpected cadenzas, never when you might guess it was happening.  Similarly the characters are ""introduced"" (by their names, in the sort of intertitles you'd see in silent films) at different lengths of time following their visual introductions.  There's a free jazz timing behind each production decision, and it's pretty exhilarating.  Yes, there are some horrid, cliched scenes in the script.  The three girls all throwing up at the same time seem to have stepped out of a satire like MEAN GIRLS; but up until that moment their interchange, and the agonistic byplay among the three, as one tries to break free of a slavish friendship, had been nearly lifelike and never boring (an extensive De Palma esque continuous moving shot sees them warily circling the cafeteria like hummingbirds).

Van Sant begins the movie with a painful sequence in which John makes his  dad pull over, too drunk to drive, and take the wheel himself, and he casts the redoubtable US actor Joseph Bottoms to play the part of the dad, thus clearly signalling a tip of the hat to the 1970s ""New American Cinema"" in which Bottoms had played such a crucial part (THE LAST PICTURE SHOW; JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN; LOVE AND PAIN AND THE WHOLE DAMN THING).  All of a sudden, the opening tells us, a lineage shows itself, ancestry asserts itself.  Youth grows old, despite what happens in the rest of the movie.",1163289600,6,2401,4.7040572792362765
1994152,5,B0001EFUFK,"Take my hand. Let's talk in whispers.

Why? Because it's study hall, that's why---you know, with that [naughty word, rhymes with hitch] of a librarian who is already staring us down with her double-ot cobalt-blue stink-eye, and, well, because yes, I have a Mauser in my pants but yes, I'm also Happy to See You.

Oh, and because what I'm about to say might shock you. You might scream, and that might start people running, and you know it's really hard to get a dead-aim on a moving target, no matter how easy it looks in the movies or when you're playing DOOM3 on your hopped-up godware system your folks plunked down 6K for over Christmas-break (damn, I meant to say 'Winter Holiday', guess that's another 180 demerits for me).

But first---""Elephant"": Gus Van Sant's sly, sneaky little exegesis on the 1999 Columbine Massacre, is a masterpiece of cinematic understatement, and a first stab at answering the question no one dares ask: what do you get when you pack 13-year old children, hormones ablaze, into a concrete box for four years, at the very instant where their center of influence is shifting from teacher & parent to peers---and then expect them to Learn?

Let's talk about High School. Four years where every single thing is both achingly important and relentlessly trivial. Four years where Social Darwinism is flipped off, where Evolutionary Gravity is reversed, and where those least able to make it after the Looking Glass that is High School lord it over everyone else.

Face it: isn't that why High School reunions are such a deep well of nervous tension and gloating revenge? The supreme reversal of fortune, where the big guns are loaded up by the Survivors, where the class nerd rides back into town in a Rolls and the Jocks---good enough to rule their backwater gridirons, but not disciplined enough for the pro-leagues---are losing their hair and hawking insurance & used cars.

That's what Gus Van Sant does in ""Elephant"", in which Van Sant deploys his camera as a kind of unobtrusive probe before the infamously opaque surface of a High School in its last serene minutes before Apocalypse. Van Sant wields his camera with a kind of spare, fluid, long-tracking elegance, using it as an instrument to pick a target and stay by his side, slipping back, or ahead, physically & temporally, using the camera as recording-device and scalpel and heightening both the banality and the creeping, mounting sense of malevolence and doom.

It's an approach Richard Linklater used in ""Slackers"", and here it works doubly well: Van Sant's approach plunges madly along like a latter-day Rashomon, air-dropping the viewer into the field alongside characters we know only from a snippet of their actions, as they move through their cloistered environment, through sleek, gleaming, otherworldly hallways of their high school, in the instants before carnage and madness.

American Higher Education may not produce scholars---hell, it chiefly rolls out illiterates---but along the way it does succeed at one thing: turning out Monsters. And why? Gus Van Sant doesn't get involved in that polemic---his camera is far too voyeuristic, to its credit, not intrusive, present merely to record---but I'll venture a guess: it's about that glorious little extra of our educational system called ""Socialization"". You know, the thing you're missing out on if you're home-schooled.

I mean, c'mon---didn't you ever wonder why Dylan & Eric set off firebombs in the Cafeteria? I mean, by Odin's Flaming Nuggets, why the Cafeteria, of all the banal, innocent, wall-eyed places in the school? Why not napalm Detention, or the office of the Dean of Students, or the Pre-Calc Study Hall, surely all of them far better oubliettes of silent adolescent agony than the poor ol' Cafeteria, yes?

No. No, I think not. You know why? Because the Cafeteria was, to the outcasts, to the pariah, to the Leper, and to the Royalty, the place where Court was held, where the All-Important Question was endlessly debated, reviewed, decided: Are you In? or Are you Out?

Like Versailles in France, or the Tuilleries: where cliques formed, where the Nobility doled out its scant awards and ample scourges, Sheep on the Right, Goats on the Left. And God help you if you were a Goat.

Follow me?

Loosen up: why do you think Marat and Danton and Robespierre and his pack of Jacobins, Red in Tooth and Claw, tore through the palaces and the courts and the bastions of privilege---even unto the Church vestries!---with pitchfork and saber and torch? Because, Children, that was where the Royalty had its place, and where they---and their uncouth brothers and sisters of the People, could be kept out, walled off, pushed down.

So they set fire to the Cafeteria. Call it a Revolution, in miniature, a little thinking globally, acting *way* locally, if you dig. Taking the Power Back.

So back to Gus Van Sant: ""Elephant"" works because it keeps its distance.

1994153,1,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant did not analyze anything in this film.  He just made his camera point at people, mostly students attending a rather large high school in a nice suburb, who were supposedly going about a typical day in their livee.  There were so many errors in this film.  We have had a century full of a steady stream of psycho and social analysis of human behavior.  But Mr. Van Sant is saying we still don't know anything at all, because come look, here are kids killing each other.  He thinks we will conclude that is no explanation for such violence and impersonal mayhem.

1.  How come there were no cops or firemen on the scene?  The blond kid was the only one who seem to notice what was going on.

2.  How come the black kid was roaming the halls knowing there were shooters?  He could of left like 99.9% of the human race would have. Except for the girl in shock that he escorted out of the busted window, he just went looking the shooters like an idiot and got shot.

3.  How come, at the end, the cute couple didn't leave the building? They had a good head start on the shooter, but chose a meat locker with no escape to hide in.  And, how did the shooter know they were in there?

4.  For gun lovers only:  How come nobody ran from the shooters, which would have given them something to aim at with more skill.  These shooter types usually like a little bit of a challenge, I mean, they practiced a lot with video game shooting. Their live targets were all like fish in a barrel.

5.  There were so many stupid moments like these, but the stupidest was the actual shooting spree part where the audience almost gets a vicarious thrill out of the action after being bored for 108 minutes.  What a dark, awful and totally wrong way to end a movie that is supposed to be either art or educational.  Nothing, is what you really get.

There was nothing even close to any real life school shooting.  We may never know why these shootings began or why they suddenly ended. But, most  Americans want to know.  This film doesn't help",1161475200,9,2032,4.309523809523809

1994160,4,B0001EFUFK,"Having Diane Keaton among the producers, Gus Van Sant delivers an excellent film about what seemed to be an ordinary day at a high school. Based on the Columbine events, Van Sant succeeds in delivering the feeling of dread as the movie goes on. And he does that by introducing as many characters as possible and by following them in their daily activities at school, this leading to have certain scenes repeated more than once from different perspectives.

Yes, the directing style may feel a little bit awkward at the beginning, but that is the whole idea. The film is not treated like an ordinary movie, it really takes you there and shows you how this type of things can happen when you least expect it. There is no character development I agree, but the director's point was to present it as real as possible; while others criticize the fact that the camera follows some students during their long walks in corridors or fields, I personally find it interesting as these scenes show you some interaction between characters with no cuts between them, something that is not usual neither easy to accomplish.

The film's tension builds as you see what is about to happen, yet you do not know why, when or how it will. Why these kids do what they do is not explained, some of their reasons to be angry are mentioned briefly but no more details or explanations are given. That's the way this movie works, shows you the facts only and lets you do the thinking.

The movie has an audio track on DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 which is good, but the movie doesn't really have that much of music or sound effects to consider it an added value. A `Making of' is also included, while short is a little bit illustrative of the process of making the film, recommended to watch.

A crude, real and interesting film, `Elephant' will leave you thinking after watching it. Sadly, we have seen this in real life from our perspective; Van Sant takes you there and leaves the reasons or explanations for you to think of. Why the name `Elephant'? Well, there are only 2 elephants in the film, one is a drawing hanging on a wall and the other one is printed on the quilt of a bed in the same room, strange uh?",1151971200,,2189,4.492462311557789

It was, for the most part, a series of exaggerations to get at his own least-common-denominator point of view.

(For example, the incredibly simplistic and primitive game one of the shooters was playing which seemed to be called: ""Shoot Random Civilians in the Back of the Head"").

It came across as though he was trying to (and very insultingly) illustrate to the viewer that ""videogames cause violence.""

But if you look at history, I think you'll find that violence came a few days before videogames.

If Gus wanted to get that message across, he could have at least used better footage to articulate the idea (AT LEAST), rather than using what looked like a shoddily-assembled Flash animation.

Furthermore, he fails to explore ideas like how his parents could have missed the mass of bullet holes in the garage (or was it basement? It's been awhile.) woodpile, and other examples abound (see previous post: Flat).

Just random things like this...it seems he thinks we're too simple to question the various aspects of how insulting to our intelligence this movie actually is.

But then again, the LCD (forementioned Least Common Denominator: my favorite term for simpletons) aspect of movies like this is drama. And every idiot loves drama, no matter how poorly from its original context that it is derived.

So if you're curious, that's how some people manage to rate movies like this with as much as 4 or even 5/5 stars without simultaneously hanging themselves.

Van Sant doesn't seem to care enough to attach any depth to his characters, and he allots them only such prefuntory moments on screen so that we know who they are when they get gunned down.

What is his exulted reputation based on?  Drugstore Cowboy? This film, and his other recent work, for certain, is vacant, and feels like an exercise rather than a fully-realized piece of art.

1994164,3,B0001EFUFK,"It is hard to know what Gus Van Sant had in mind when creating the film ""Elephant."" Here is a film about a 'typical' day in the life of a high school that - unbeknownst to all but two students - will culminate in a school shooting. Most of the film centers on the mundane interaction between an alternating cast of students. But what was Van Sant's intent with the film? As witnessed by the very mixed reviews, it is a question that - like the film he created - has no satisfactory answer.

Here is what is certain. We get to know none of the characters in the way that most films allow characters to be known. We see them only from a distance - very superficially. Even the shooters are presented in a very distant and illusive way that never lets us peer, as we desperately want to, into their skulls.

My guess is that this was deliberate on Van Sant's part (which will not prevent it from being irritating to many veiwers). As a high school teacher myself, I find it plausible that Van Sant only shows characters superficially to emulate what high school actually IS like. As one of the characters innocuously says halfway through the film: ""I mean, how can you know someone's spirit?"" Was that line, I wondered, really innocuous? Or was that the explanation for what some call the film's ""pointlessness"" (and what others celebrate as its ""realism""?)

All that is to say that if you want a character study, Elephant is certainly not your film.

So, why did I give it three stars despite the fact that - contra many reviewers - I think the tedium was a necessary part of the film? Because improvising a script takes much more talent than some expect and much more talent than these actors - none of whom are experienced - had.

Particularly in a film where chatty conversation is supposed to sound like chatty conversation, too much of the improvised dialogue seemed awkward, self-conscious, and forced. Again, as someone who is in high schools all day, I can attest that these conversations fail to replicate the feel of 16-year-olds-in-the-hall conversation. And as these conversations constitute the backbone of the film, the film suffers tremendously because of it - enough to cost it two stars.

So despite the fact that I think Van Sant and crew got the overall feel right and were correct not to let us get too deep into explanations and character study, the film ultimately falls on the clumsy dialogue.

If you want an explanation for school shooting, go see Michael Moore's ""Bowling at Columbine"" amongst others. If you want to see what the day in the life of a high school shooting probably looks like in actuality, see elephant. Just keep in mind that actual high schoolers in actual high schools produce better dialogue than this film was able to concoct.",1149984000,,2771,4.631364562118126

This is one of the most amazing films to come out of the US in a long time. I also recommend Van Sant's other two in the triptych: Gerry, and Last Days. All three are very, very good films.

The sound design by Leslie Schatz is also exceptional and lends to the dreamy, surreal violence in Elephant.

The use of repeat/refrain suggests a song structure and the slow-motion effects help induce a dreamy distance from the action taking place. This is masterful and sophisticated filmmaking.

Headsup: If you liked this style of filmmaking I also recommend checking out Hungarian filmmaker Bela Tarr whose work influenced Van Sant in the making of Gerry, Elephant and Last Days.",1149724800,4,850,4.841379310344828
1994166,1,B0001EFUFK,"I had several problems with Elephant:

1) Flat.  The movie had virtually no dramatic tension.  We see overlong shots of people walking through hallways, engaged in small talk...for EXCRUTIATINGLY long periods of time.  No matter how you rationalize this, whatever meaning or message you want to assign these shots (75% of the movie at least), it is extraordinarily boring.  I got so sick of watching the back of a guy's head as he walked through a hallway for a solid minute I began fast-forwarding through some of the scenes.

2) Acting and Directing.  Eventually (and mercifully for the viewer), Gus Van Sant finally introduces the school shootings near the end of the film.  The student and faculty reactions are unauthentic.  The actors lazily prance away.  When I was in school, the kids scrambled faster to watch a fistfight, much less if two psychopaths opened fire in the building.

3)  Style.  The movie is all style, a little content and message, no acting, and no dialogue.  You get the impression after ten minutes of viewing that Van Sant started out making a film loosely based on Columbine and got distracted playing around with his damn camera.

I understand the point of the film...its a normal day...here's a little bit into the life of some of the kids at the schol...here's a little bit about the kids who did it.  Not going to explain why it happened....etc.  Thats fine.  But the end result is a boring, dull film.  People like this movie because they are curious about Columbine and school violence in general, and the tedious directing style of Van Sant gives the impression its an intelligent art film.",1149638400,4,1627,4.808664259927798
1994167,2,B0001EFUFK,"This movie won big at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, and I'm still trying to figure out why. The movie chronicles two days in the life of a several high school students, two of whom are plotting a school killing spree. The name of the movie comes from the old story of several blind men touching and describing different parts of an elephant. (Each man is firmly convinced that he alone realizes what type of animal he is confronting. In truth, none of the men are aware, because they do not see the entire picture of the elephant.)

The film is shot in long shots, which follow the various students as they go about their daily activities. While many of their paths cross (you see some of the characters walking by in the background while the camera focuses on whoever you're following at that moment), they don't interact very much.

For the most part, I found this film unrewarding. First of all, I thought that the characters were dealt with very superficially. Van Sant doesn't let us get too close to any of them, and as a result I didn't care too much about any of them. Secondly, the majority of the movie just follows kids as they walk through high school halls, check out books, and eat lunch in the cafeteria. I think that a minimum of this action might have been necessary to set the scene and re-introduce us to high school life, but these shots made up the bulk of the movie. I know that some argue that this is the point of the film, that great tragedy arises out of the minutiae of everyday life, that horrible events are unpredictable and difficult to trace to any sort of triggering moment. However, I'm not so sure that such trivia makes for a compelling film. (And who wants to go back to high school? Not this viewer.)

Lastly, I felt that the erotic scene between the two shooters was gratuitous. It just felt thrown in and strained, and nothing I'd seen previously seemed to make it necessary or even meaningful.

On the whole, I thought the film was not very provocative, even though it dealt with a topic that could have been mined for some cathartic discussion and thought. The film seemed totally disconnected from any of the events that occured. Van Sant seemed to have no direction, no reason for making this film. He just gives us a fly-on-the-wall perspective of a school shooting that is detatched and emotionless. I really didn't think that was the best treatment for this subject matter.

So, I guess, for me, the elephant in the room is why on earth this film earned such acclaim. I kind-of feel like the child in the Emperor's New Clothes fable, shouting out, ""But he isn't wearing ANYTHING!""",1149552000,,2628,4.547568710359408
1994168,1,B0001EFUFK,"I caught Elephant the other night on Cinemax. I had been curious about it after reading the blurb that it was about high-school shootings. During the first two-thirds of the film, I stuck with the bland stereotypes and uninteresting fixations on hallways and backs of heads with the assumption that the movie was going to go somewhere relevant. When the shootings began, I stayed with the film, still assuming it had somewhere relevant to go. As the shooter began to play eenie-meenie-miney-moe in the freezer, I held in there.. still assuming there would be a point to protraying these events.

Then the credits began to role, and I realized that not only did this film not go anywhere relevant, it never intended to. It's easy to excuse the film's pointlessness by making up contrived reasons such as ""it was intended to show how pointless these events are,"" but such excuses hold water about as well as a cheese grater. With the right spin-doctoring, utter banality and gratuitous violence can be dressed up a facade of artsyness in the same way that any art student can feign artistic merit by prancing around in neo-beatnik togs. The irony of such people.. and such films.. is that in their attempts to be so different from everyone else, they become even more alike. In trying to separate themselves from one crowd, they just become sheep in another.

Much of the praise for this film linked by Rotten Tomatoes reads like the reviewer simply didn't know what to make of the film and therefore gave it high marks. It's not uncommon for a film to gain merit under a wave of ""I didn't understand it, so it MUST be good!"" This is especially easy when a film deals with controversial topics linked to real-world events. (Seriously, just how many people do you think will have the stones to say United 93 is a rotten movie should that prove the case?)

Elephant dresses itself in some of the trappings of an artful, meaningful film. But, in the end, it's nothing more than an excuse to indulge in some good ol'-fashioned American vi-o-lence. The final third of the movie looks like little more than some aspiring SFX enthusiast filming a shootout merely for the sake of showing how he can make blood splatters. By the time you get to the shootings, you start to suspect that the first two-thirds of the movie were little more than a vehicle to get you to this event.... not to provide any real substance or impact to it. By the time the credits start, you feel like the director simply wanted to film a gratuitous shootout, but had to tack on an additional 65 minutes of footage to present the illusion that there is some relevance for the shootout scene.

In that respect, Elephant is basically gun-porn. In the same way that porn movies attempt to present some kind of story simply to set up pointless sex scenes for the mere sake of showing sex... Elephant attempts to present some kind of story simply to give itself an excuse to show a pointless shootout.

As you watch the movie, you get the feeling it tries to distance itself from the kind of gratuitous violence often shown in movies and is often attributed as a cause for violent acts in real life. In the end, however, you realize that in trying to distance itself from movies with gratuitous, pointless violence.. it becomes the very thing it tries not to be. In terms of commenting on and de-sensationalizing violence, Elephant's pointlessness and fixation on the final act achieves such commentary about as well as the Die Hard trilogy. The only real difference between the shootouts in your average Hollywood movie and Elephant is that Elephant, much like the kid disguised as a beatnik, takes its failed intent far too seriously to realize it became everything it didn't want to be.

In that respect, Elephant comments on violence in general and violence in the media about as well as a PETA member protesting a slaughterhouse with a sign in one hand and a cheeseburger in the other.",1147996800,,3949,4.691197691197691

I liked parts of it and I can grasp the overall message, but I'll be human and admit that it is a bit dull, and the long monotonous corridor scenes are a little tiresome.

  Plus I only grew to like one character in the whole movie, the blond mop-topped kid from the first scene. He seemed like a really decent guy. And I liked that the sheer pointlesness, lack of motives, and nihilistic outlook of the shooters themselves and their actions were depicted. Not because it vilifies them, but because it shows how truly, these kid killers are really just confused kids who lash out without really having a motive, other than the bleakness of their surroundings and the availabilty of some scapegoat (""cruel"" teachers, ""dumb"" jocks etc.) I also enjoyed a scene that follows a tall athlete who, during the violence, helps some classmates to safety and walks slowly and purposefully toward the shooters to tackle them unarmed, only to be abruptly shot anyway. That scene showed me a heroic action, portrayed simply and realistically without the dramatic fireworks and musical crescendoes. It's a nice piece of art, but is it a fun freaky flick to kick back with over a bowl of popcorn? Not really, watch it when most receptive to subtleties.",1146441600,3,1421,4.815573770491803

However, this film sorely lacks the reality of violence, the brutality. I never once accepted the killers, as they killed, as real, and I never accepted the way the victims reacted to the violence as real. That is where the film went horribly wrong, at the end. The violence and the reactions were just as mundane as the pre-violence segments of the film.

There is a complexity to the execution violence that was lost. There is a complexity to people's reaction towards violence that was lost. It was most unfortunate.

You people look at it as ""oh its boring, and horrible acting blahblahblahblah"" Have any of you even thought that that was the purpose. Gus Van Sant in my opinion did this movie perfect- He made it realisitc. He acted as if you were just a teen walking down the halls seeing these people (which is why you never get to really know them) because of this, it affects you more because you see how ordinary teens that you don't know the full background just go down instantly. As a teenager who attends a public high school, this is a very really thought, we all know how many school shootings happen every year. This director didn't take it from an emotional dramatic view, but yet made it realistic which in my opinion affects you more. So while all of you think it sucks because you couldn't connect to any characters, well dears, thats the brilliant point. This movie was intended to leave all the opinions, emotional thoughts and backgrounds of the characters to yourself. He gave you the raw idea of what was going on. If you were at that school shooting, lets be realistic, you wouldnt know the background of most of the people. And thats the idea Sant trys to get you to be in, the position of just seeing it all happen. So instead of worrying about the cinematic effects and the ""bad acting"" (hate to say it, but it was exactly how teens sound; i should know), and the ""boringness"" or not being able to connect to the characters, everyone needs to rewatch this movie and understand it from how it is.

1994172,5,B0001EFUFK,"""Elephant"" is a film about a normal day in high school that ends in a Columbine-esque massacre. We become observers of the events that happen throughout the day, as the film is filled with long tracking shots of students going out of and into classes, the cafeteria, the gym, or the library. The characters in the film are mostly played by non-actors, and most of the film is improvised.

To some, ""Elephant"" is nothing more than a slow paced film that displays a normal day at school that ends with kids shooting each other. To me, a 17 year old teenager (at the time of writing this review), Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" is one of the most realistic films based on teens that I've ever seen. It's a film that depicts alienation and isolation amongst teens like few films have (films like Todd Solondz's ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World"" come to mind). It shows a realistic day-in-the-life of a group of teenagers, and as you see them walk through the halls, you come to the conclusion that it is nothing but a normal day for them. The first time I saw this, it stayed with me for days, mostly due to the fact that I could relate to some of the characters. It is very disturbing to watch the events unfold, but it is an excellent film nonetheless.

Kudos to Gus Van Sant; I give ""Elephant"" my highest recommendation.",1142294400,4,1341,4.51440329218107
1994173,1,B0001EFUFK,"I read countless reviews of this movie and they all praised its ""brilliance"". I understand society is probably tired of box office romantic comedy blockbusters or cliche' teen movies but honestly, This film reminds me of how even more generic it is to jump on the idependent art-house film bandwagon. I appreciate that it may be someone's kind of movie but the amount of good press this predominantly cult film has gotten is ridiculous. The obsession with movies like this is getting even more stale then the admittance of enjoying stereotypical movies.

I have no dislike for this director, in fact I'm dissappointed because I found his previous work 'To Die For', a great movie.

Nicole Kidman's charcter was so persistant and uncannily believable. I'm a person who likes to be entertained, who appreciates great dialogue and thrilling montages ala 'Requiem For A Dream'. I felt no connection with the characters, I just wanted to see them get shot so that they might just come out of their shells and do something.

I didn't find the movie realistic, as a high school student, I don't know of ANYONE who talks so blandly or barely does. I also know that people are more usually more lively in hallways and don't scream a little bit when they're lives are in danger, non-chalantly wander through the halls when there's a massacre occuring or look at the chaos from outside and not feel anything. Are these people in the movie at a special school for emotionless ignoramuses?

I didn't like the long scenes, they were overly-indulgent of artsy film 'style', the director made me feel like he was trying to be some unopinionated, unmeddling, artist. I didn't enjoy this movie. I hated all the waiting and how little ever happened.

It is unrealistic and too slow to make it's point of ""not making a point"". Congratulations Van Sant, you have shown everyone how creatively uncreative you are.

I wish he would have taken a stand. I hate movies that don't display personalities. As a writer, characters are very important to me and no person is as spineless as any of the actors (sorry, non-actors) in the movie.

I'd like to ask the masses of people who loved or even liked the movie what they usually enjoy most in films. I don't think it's characterization or entertaining action. Was it the 'tension' the movie created by being so mudane to contrast with the shock and horror of school shootings? Or is it the entire message of a watched film? Because if it is those things, I still can't understand why 'Elephant' is so highly regarded. It could have been much better.",1141862400,7,2571,4.751121076233184
1994174,2,B0001EFUFK,"Let's get real here. In the closing credits, there is a line that says ""any resemblance to actual people and events is purely coincidental"". Coincidental? The entire movie is a fictional version of the Columbine High School massacre...right down to the shootings in the cafeteria and library; two malcontents obsessed with guns and Hitler, one of them even named Eric, who was one of the killers at Columbine. So, who is Gus Van Sant trying to kid? The parallels are obvious.

While I admire anyone willing to tackle the events behind Columbine, I think this film was far too artsy/independent for the subject matter at hand. An amazon reviewer explained the point of featuring the mundane in contrast to the shocking violence, but I don't think it worked, at least not for me. Seeing students walking with their backs to the camera and one of the boys playing the piano for over 5 minutes...those scenes made it boring to watch. True, its a mundane detail in life that we don't see in films, which is why we don't. The story is more important than showing the unnecessary details of life. It is that reason why I subtract several stars.

What I like about the film were the acting by unknowns and the way the film flowed (how we would follow one student through his/her routine then the film would pick up on another, then another, each time taking us back earlier in the day). It was unique and not too difficult to follow. For me, the most disturbing aspect of the film are the three girls in the cafeteria, how one of them demands from the others that they hang out with her and shop after school. It was so real and what I remember about high school...how controlling some people are in their friendships. That conversation perfectly illustrated the superficiality of the high school environment.

However, when the most interesting thing about the movie is the documentary on Hitler that is shown for several minutes, that's an indication of how ultimately boring I found this film. I wanted to see the documentary in its entirity rather than watch this drivel. I expected better of Gus Van Sant. But to his credit, I was alarmed when the shooting started happening, because after showing us the mundane routine of several students, the shooting does jar me out of my coma. That might have been his point, and for that reason, it is a brilliant move. However, because I think a film about what happened at Columbine could have and should have been more carefully constructed, I expected more than he was able to deliver. It's hard to recommend this film and one I'd never watch again. I also doubt that anyone who has ever lived through a school shooting would ever want to watch this film. It is disturbing, to say the least. Consider yourself forewarned.",1140480000,5,2762,4.690721649484536
1994175,2,B0001EFUFK,"Van Sant spends too much time articulating absolutely nothing, which ultimately conveys no message.  Sadly, Columbine ALREADY happened.  Predictably, I knew the outcome of the story after the first 5 minutes into the film.  This movie would of been powerful, raw, in your face truth of reality IF Columbine never existed, however knowing Columbine existed didn't really help.  I was really expecting more dialogue in this movie versus camera angles.  Van Sant spent too much time tinkering with the camera settings than he did with character development.  I was begging for some sort of introduction to at least one of the characters in order to prepare me for a sad ending, but that whole idea was never introduced in this film.  All I was prepared for were two kids entering a typical public school and killing people at random.  Furthermore the whole shower scene showing both killers bathing together and kissing each other wasn't necessary.  It seems to me Van Sant loses track of the storyline of this film, and tries his best to satisfy all the artsy fartsy viewers.  In order to satisfy those viewers, he gives up on creating a more structured story-line, but yet unique camera angles?  Obviously that turns problematic trying to satisfy a certain jaura of people.  In conclusion, I believe this movie would of been a bit more interesting if we learned any further information on at least one of the characters, I wouldn't even care if we were enguled in the character of the goddamn principle.  Nonetheless Van Sant strays away from that concept, and spends his time creating something very predictable.

1994176,5,B0001EFUFK,"This was a great movie. I saw it today at a friends house on HBO on Demand. Let me tell you this was worth every second we spent on it. The movie begins showing each major characters point of view on a normal high school day.

  I did kind of find it weird how a teacher and a janitor walk by Alex and that other kid while they were holding guns and did nothing about it. I really liked the ending because it stopped after Eenie Meenie Miney Moe (spell check?) on the couple in the freezer. Just stops. I really liked the ending because it would suck if they made the good guys win or if they good guys lost. I think that if they showed anything past that point, it wouldnt have got me thinking about what might happen. It got me thinking for like an hour after the movie finished, I was like ""Did anyone call the cops?"", ""Did everyone outside make it?"", ""Did Alex go crazy and commit suicide?"".

  Another thing I really liked was that it was stuff that actually happens in school. People like that actually exist. And I know this might sound a little weird, but this really is a dark movie and there is nothing positive about it at all, which makes me like it so much. In most movies, good things happen, maybe a little tear in the middle, but everything is fixed and the good guys win. In this movie, nothing good really happens and everyone is shot. Its not a movie that is just ""Oh, lets kill people just cuz we feel like shooting guns"". Its about serious things, problems people have and the real world and how its not as optimistic and happy as people think it is. I could go on forever, but, im gonna stop. In conclusion, i really liked this movie a lot, five stars all the way.",1140393600,4,1686,4.204334365325077

In a DVD feature, the young person playing one of the shooters says ""High School was Hell."" And that is real life.

As other reviewers have noted, the movie lets you the viewer work on the elements and work things out.

Too many movies these days wind up in a flurry of high-tech violence, car chases and the like. Very little room for individual analysis.

So see it, and see it again. Let's hope we can develop a society where senseless violence is  replaced with something more humane. Peace.",1140220800,5,696,4.580645161290323
1994178,5,B0001EFUFK,"I watched this film about a month ago. It still hangs with me.

I don't recall being this disturbed by a film in recent memory.

I was curious about what other people had to say about it and I am quite suprised at the negative reviews here. Obviously, the intent of this film went over the heads of many of my fellow reviwers.

""Elephant"" presents a scenerio that references the Columbine massacre as well as other incidents. In an almost ""cinema verite""

angle, this movie shows an average day at an average high school that goes horribly wrong. As the camera meanders around the campus, we meet a cross section of high school students just doing their thing. At least for me, this helped suspend my disbelief. When the two shooters show up and start killing, I forgot that I was watching a movie. This brought home to me the horror and tragedy of this type of event than any ""news clippings"". This film doesn't try to explain or provide insight as to why things like this happen. It merely seeks to expose the veiwer in the context of raw experience. We are left to make our own judgements. I also am of the opinion that ""Elephant""

serves as a sobering counter point to the absurd canonisation of

Harris and Keibold ( the Columbine shooters) that I see on the internet. The whole idea that this type of murderous action is legitamate expression of anger and alienation is as reprehensible as it is irresponsible. There is no justification for the wanton slaughter of innocent lives wether it is commited by an alienated high school student or a militant terrorist. As Gus Van Sant avoids any distortion in terms of charactor, he also seems to have a strong respect for teenagers. I cared about the charactors and some reminded me of peeps I went to high school with.

""Elephant"" also cuts through the politisation of Columbine by again presenting an event like this in a realistic fashion. Perhaps some of my fellow reviewrs would have liked this film more if Tony Scott or Rennie Harlin directed along with a hip soundtrack including songs by System of a Down and Disturbed. I dunno. Art is powerful when it sheds light on the human experince as this film does. The final scene is especially chilling.",1138579200,6,2206,4.612244897959184
1994179,3,B0001EFUFK,I really don't get this idea of taking real events and making a movie that is 90% like the real thing.  It's much easier to just read the news clippings.,1138147200,2,153,4.1

McCain, I really don't care if you received 1300 on your SAT. That doesn't prove anything.

1994181,1,B0001EFUFK,"I understand that people want to be unique and make films that are different from others but elephant is just in another league and takes reality to another level. For one thing yes filming children walk around in a school all day and showing how some get picked on and some are popular and est. is very realistic but the reason films aren't made exactly like real life is because it's very boring that way. When I watch a movie I really don't feel the need to see some guy walk in a circle for 15 minutes, maybe he did that in real life but who wants to see him do that. The movie needed to show the kids emotions develop over some time because if you don't exactly know what the movie is about then your watching it and wondering why two kids kill off most of a school just because for one day people were throwing wet paper wads at them.

Elephant is very slow and boring and if you don't agree with what I'm saying then show it to a class of high school student's and count how many of them have actually paid attention or are awake at the end of the movie, I can guarantee your only going to be counting for about 2 seconds. The teacher will learn the lesson but the student's won't even know what movie was playing. I have also seen a lot of reviewers get negative votes on this film and I don't know if it's because people love this director or they saw the film and got something from it that reviewers didn't. I'm 17 and I have gone through today's high school system so I know that this movie was done lazy and sloppy, It doesn't explain anything. It's different if it was said that these two kids were just craving blood and did what they did but from the little bit that was shown you come to say I think those kids got picked on so that's why they're doing this. This is not a documentary on a true story it is a movie and a half done movie. If people say they got nothing from it as in no feelings, no morals, and no sympathy for anything that happened so what the heck was the movie for.

If kids my age had to do a research paper on these acts how would we be able to write wht their motives were, or what life was like at home for these kids to be so unhappy and crazy to do what they did. Bottom line is you don't exactly know why these two shot the entire school up they seemed happy but they did this and really the kids they killed seemed like the ones with the true problems, one child with a drunk for a father but all he did was show up late to school not kill the school. This movie is half done and why some people have a gigantic attachment to it is beyond me but maybe the ones voting should speak up and explain to me a high school student why this is such a realistic film.",1137542400,2,2703,4.050467289719626
1994182,5,B0001EFUFK,"So here's a little story about my viewing experience with Elephant.

I watched this movie with my younger brother.  We're both high school kids.  Before Elephant, we'd both watched a few more drama, psychological films, some independent and major movies that have been praised for making the viewers really think.  We both enjoy this type of movie, though it's one of the few things we have in common, when it comes to film.  He enjoys action and sci-fi.  Generally, when he overhears conversation about a new horror movie, the first question from him is ""Who died?"".  I prefer drama and romance movies, anything with lots of realistic human emotions and situations.

So anyway.  The first hour or so of Elephant passes, and we're both a little anxious, we're kids.  A few times we've laughed, a few times we've 'aww...'ed, and honestly, maybe once or twice we've groaned, the first two thirds of Elephant simply aren't all that entertaining, though I do appreciate it all.  The climax of the film begins, and I'm shocked.  I knew it was coming, and because of that I didn't expect to get that gut-wrenching feeling.  I actually expected of myself to be able to sit back and take it all in normally, like the other films we'd watched throughout the past few days, but I instead got that tingly feeling we've all had at some point in our lives, and I'm shocked.  My brother, he sees my reaction and he calmly asks ""What's wrong?"".

If you come into this film and expect it to think for you, you'll be left wondering what everyone else is seeing.  Quite simply, if you can call yourself an avid action film lover, Elephant may not be for you.  If you prefer leaving the theater with a physical rush instead of psychological rush, Elephant may not be for you.  If you can't take a film for it's entire package and effect, but rather the sum of it's parts and who gets killed, Elephant most certainly isn't for you.",1137283200,3,1911,4.603550295857988
1994183,4,B0001EFUFK,"The money made off of ""Good Will Hunting"" has allowed Gus Van Sant to freedom to make the type of movies he want to make, without any concerns about financing or appealing to a mainstream audience.  As a result, he was able to make a film like ""Elephant.""  It's a good movie, but it won't appeal to a lot of people.

This is a movie about a school shooting that brings to mind the events at Columbine High School.  The movie is strictly shot as a narrative.  It doesn't try to explain the mindset of the shooters.  It doesn't try to reationalize the things that happened.  It doesn't include any drama or heroes.  It doesn't place blame on any one thing, like violent movies or games.  It can be assumed that the director's opinion is there was no explanation for what happened, and there was no way to prevent it.

Over the course of the film, you see different kids going to school and living their lives.  Different scenes are replayed, as it follows normal kids through their normal routines.  You don't kid to know much about the kids, you just see them in their element.  Some of these kids survive, some don't--and that's just through chance.

Some people will find this movie boring.  There are long scenes without any dialog.  There is violence, but it's not sensationalized--it just happens.  Again, there is no explanation in the end.  No theories.  No rationalizations.  No big, political statements.  The point seems to be that sometimes things happen, and perhaps there is no way to explain them.",1136764800,2,1510,4.643939393939394
1994184,5,B0001EFUFK,"A pointless film?  A boring film?  Only if you can't see the elephant that's in the room with all of us, right now.

Viewing this movie is like re-experiencing the day we all opened up the newspaper to read about the Columbine massacre.  How could this happen?  Why did it happen?  No one knew.  We just stood around gaping with horror at the bare, unvarnished fact of its occurrence.  Likewise, this movie doesn't give us reasons for what happens; that's not what it's trying to do.  There's no probing character analysis, no sociological based explanations; the kids who commit the massacre face abuse at school - presumably an ongoing situation - but it's not severe enough for us to feel that there's any justification for their later actions; neither do we derive any vicarious sense of satisfaction from it.  The first person they kill, after all, is someone who's also facing abuse from other kids, a fact which only lends further weight to the idea that the violence being perpetrated is not to be interpreted or explained, excused or justified, or even understood.  Neither are we shown of any home abuse occurring to the killers; indeed, the boy with the drunk father appears to have a much worse situation to deal with in that regard, yet he's a sweetly dispositioned and concerned person.  Beyond that character, we're shown a variety of other types:  cheerleaders and jocks, young lovers, bright students, average students, students who victimize other students, students just going about an average day, etc.  None of this matters with regard to the randomness of the violence which showers down upon them; nothing saves them, nothing justifies or explains their deaths.  Why did the black kid walk straight up to one of the killers?  We don't know.  Maybe he wanted to be a hero.  Maybe he was just curious to see what was going on.  Maybe he wanted a quick and easy way out of some bad situation of his own.  Maybe he just wasn't a terribly bright person.  Any of these guesses is possible.  We just don't know.  And that's the whole point.

Trying to discuss this movie feels, in a sense, like a violation of its aims:  discussion makes the violence depicted here, or that happened at Columbine, is happening in Iraq, or wherever, seem within the realm of understanding, hence of justification or at least explanation.  Discussion therefore makes us feel safe:  if we can understand the horror, we feel we can handle it, perhaps make the situation which caused it better.  This movie is not about feeling safe.  Are we supposed to think playing violent video games gives rise to violent behavior?  If so, then apparently playing classical music does the same.  Were the two kids who committed the massacre buddies, fighting together against their oppressors?  We may think so - until one of them blows the other one away.  This is nihilism, nothing more and nothing less; and if there's any broader context for the events taking place in the film, that context is one based in a sensibility that nihilism is rapidly becoming a way of life in this world.  Perhaps nihilism is an intrinsic facet nature; clearly, it's become an intrinsic facet of the world created by human beings.  If you can see this, then you're seeing the elephant in the room.

As to the supposed homosexuality of the two killers - again, we don't know for sure.  The one kid says to the other, ""I've never even kissed anyone"" (or something similar).  So they kiss, make out; though how far they take it isn't shown.  It's unimportant - the point hasn't anything to do with homosexuality, it has to do with wanting to have a taste of something (sex) that you know you're not going to live long enough to get with anyone else.

In my opinion, this is a brilliant film, both in its aim and its method.  I know of no other film that so fully embodies the principle that the point of any story is intrinsic to the method of its telling, and combines this with a theme so wholly resistant to the sense of safety that intellectualism, and hence rationalization, brings.  You either get it, or you don't.  You either see the elephant, or you've miss the point.",1136160000,,4140,4.691666666666666

Ultimately it was a movie devoid of hope - and you expect us to believe that was the way it really went down.  Bleak realism at its most soul-destroying.

But...

1) Those two movie killers shot down a hell of a lot more kids than the real ones did.  Was that sicko wishful thinking on your part?

1994187,2,B0001EFUFK,"Not all movies are meant to entertain, and certainly, Gus Van Sant's `Elephant' is not entertaining in a traditional sense.  This is the kind of movie that viewers must ""experience"" and then contemplate.  I like that.  I recently saw Krysztof Kieslowski's `Blue' (a much less difficult film, though also quite languid in its pace) and was completely absorbed.  But - you know - just because a film breaks free from the conventions of your typically mindless, hackneyed blockbuster - that doesn't necessarily make it a good film.  And I don't think `Elephant' is a very good film.

Let me preface my complaints with a few thoughts about this film's positive qualities, though.  As intimated, it is millions of miles away from your typical Hollywood hit - and I find that really refreshing.  I liked the lingering shots, the sparse dialogue, and the attempts at ""realism.""  I was also intrigued by Van Sant's refusal to ""comment"" on school violence.  What can we say about Columbine, school shootings, and - really - any violent acts?  There is no explanation.

And yet - I don't think `Elephant' was a successful film.  Here's why:

*  To begin with, any attempts at ""realism"" were negated by the actors' and actresses' very awkward handling of dialogue and poor improvisational skills.  The effect was that of a student film.  Very forced.  I was constantly aware that I was watching a production and did not feel like I was spying on a slice of life.

* Also, while high schools are probably more like the high school in `Elephant' than the high schools in - oh say - `Clueless' or `Mean Girls' - it lacked any of the warmth of a real high school.  The building and the students felt very sterile to me.  I also felt like the featured students were facing exceptionally grave realities (an alcoholic parent; possible pregnancy; an eating disorder).  Yes, these problems exist.  But where's the high school student who is just worried about her math test?  Or the student who is joking with his friend in the lunch line?

* I had said that I enjoy lingering shots.  For the most part I do - but I also need to say that I think Van Sant borders on indulgent with his exceedingly tedious, almost antagonizing  ""cinematography.""  I don't know if this is a full-fledged criticism of mine - but I can see how many viewers, even viewers who are usually into more ""artsy"" films - might feel put off by his technique.

* Lastly - as mentioned - Van Sant does not comment on school violence.  While this is an admirable quality - it is, paradoxically, also one of the film's downfalls.  Why did he make the film?  To tell us that he has nothing to say?  I could perhaps handle his silence on a serious topic if `Elephant' had other, redeeming qualities but - in the end - I really don't think it does.  It was an interesting and perhaps ambitious experiment, but one that I could have done without.",1134000000,,2889,4.611001964636542

1994189,4,B0001EFUFK,"There is an old Hindu legend about six blind men who come upon an elephant. One thought the elephant like a wall, the second like a spear, the third thought it a snake, number four a tree, five a fan, and six thought the elephant like a rope. They bickered and argued over who was right, when each could only experience the elephant from his own perspective. (click here for the poem ""The Blind Men and the Elephant: [...])

Last night, I viewed Gus Van Sant's 2003 film Elephant. Van Sant is the directory of Good Will Hunting, one of my favorite movies, as well as director of Finding Forrester (for a classic Sean Connery line, go to [...] and turn the volume up). Elephant is Van Sant's look at a typical high school day from the eyes of a handful of students, except that it is not a typical day. As an attempt at realism, we do not see ""real"" actors, but rather, real high school students, told to create their own dialogue, and simply allow the camera to follow them.

We open with a car swerving around the neighborhood before abruptly crash stopping in front blond haired John, to the tune of Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata in the background. John makes his obviously drunk father hand over the keys and switch to the passenger seat, so that he may drive himself to school. The camera follows John as he walks around school, leaving behind the background sonata that graced our journey to a day of learning. John's travels include stopping to pose for Elias, another student and an amateur photographer, receiving a kiss on the cheek from Acadia during a sad moment, and leaving the building as Alex and Eric are about to enter, carrying heavy bags. We receive an ominous sign with Alex's warning to John, ""Get the [heck] out and don't come back! Some heavy [stuff]'s going down!""

Our next guide is Elias, photographing a gothic couple on his walk to school, developing a roll in water in the school's lab, and stopping blond haired John, and requesting he pose for some photographs. We also see football star Nathan leave practice, walk down the hall to the notice of three admiring girls, before meeting up with girlfriend Carrie. They have a lot to talk about, and the camera makes sure we witness. There is Michelle, in sadness walking down the hallway, walking by Nathan before he meets up with Carrie. We meet three girls, noticing Nathan walking towards Carrie, disgusted that he is taken. Through the windows we can see John leaving school and Alex and Eric walking toward the doors. The three girls will have lunch and throw up in the bathroom, Michelle will receive a talking to from a teacher about refusing to wear gym class shorts. We see Eric get picked on, and Alex sit at his piano to break the long musical silence in the film with Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. Everyone has problems and hurts. Everyone is in emotional flux. We may look upon their problems as petty or small, but to a teenager in transition, small things really can affect one's emotional well-being. If anything, for those who have forgotten, we are reminded that high school is not an easy time.

From the first frame, we can sense that something seems wrong, even in a seemingly ordinary day. The relatively early glimpse of Alex and Eric alerts us to what will transpire. Yet, our anticipation and angst are never met with an explanation before the final scene of violence erupts. No explanation is given. We do not come to an understanding. In naming his film Elephant, Van Sant could be saying that there is no answer, explanation, or solution to horrendous acts such as these. Like in the parable above, each blind man experiences the elephant from his own perspective. We all see things differently. In order to find a cure, first we must have a correct diagnosis to the illness. What is the ""illness"" that causes troubled youth to engage in acts of school violence? Van Sant throws his hands up. He does not know. All of the characters we meet have problems, so why did these two end up being the ones? Some of the characters we meet die and some do not, yet we do not see a reason why. We are left with the Moonlight Sonota and no closure.",1133481600,10,4142,4.585695006747638
1994190,5,B0001EFUFK,"While I do not intend to discredit the feelings of other reviewers of this film, I would like to say a few things that struck as profound about it.

I imagine the content is already familiar--the setting of a school shooting at a high school; the film-making is amazing, as if you were walking behind each of the characters.  Sometimes I've been at school following people and thought of (without meaning to) Elephant.  It's haunting, in a way.

Yes, there may be a lack of feeling or emotion in the movie; there may seem to be ""no point""--Elephant may seem to many nothing more than an aimless report of events.  Then I also hear the people who say that the film presents life as it is; no glamour, no nothing--and that is what makes it great.

Well, personally, I refuse to believe that Gus Van Sant's Elephant is pointless drivel--all things have an argument.  And I believe his argument can be found precisely in the fact that there seems to be a lack of emotion or interest in the film.  We, desensitized to this horror, watch it with relative uninterest.  The characters (or the viewers) are epitomized in the one photographer teen who snaps a photo of the killers when they enter the library.  These characters may not care much about life or what is happening, and this is a horror in and of itself!

The events of the movie are not surprising, because they have happened before and they will happen again.  And I believe the movie portrays accurately the attitudes of many, many students towards this kind of an event.  It will be shocking when it happens, but within a few years' time many people will have moved on, and some may have even nearly forgotten, pushing it to the backs of their minds.

There is a lot of truth in this film, about school life, about people and their attitudes towards life, but perhaps more importantly, about us; with such gore and violence out there, Elephant looks ""lackluster.""  We are not affected by this violence.  But the characters--their vacant misery, their absence of enthusiasm, their disinterest, their selfishness, and the horror of their actions are , I think, brilliantly and accurately portrayed.  It is, if you think about it, scary.",1133136000,5,2191,4.678851174934726
1994191,1,B0001EFUFK,"Walking into this movie, I had high hopes and expectations. I was in 7th grade when the Columbine incident took place and now live in Colorado and attend church and school with a few students who were present at the attacks. After reading so much about the various school shootings that have taken place in my lifetime, I expected to see this horrendous reality in film form to be able to slightly understand what some of those present may have gone through.

All I received in return for my high expectations was disgust. [...]I'm a youth pastor who works with junior and senior high students. I see these students struggle through ""minor"" tragedy after tragedy and see the broadest range of emotions. Life is not about the ""romanticizing"" of the violence, no. But there is a huge difference between ""romanticizing violence"" and being true to a student's humanity and emotion.

Elephant was a ridiculous portrayal of a handful of students who just didn't give a damn. The blonde boy with the alcoholic father stands outside, seeing the results of the explosions in the school and watching students pour out of the school in tears and screams...and all he can do is ask his father where he's been. He does nothing. He stands and watches...without disbelief, anger, melancholy...really no emotion of any kind at all. The black student that just randomly walks through the school hallways while everyone else runs away does so without a sense of urgency or fear. He finds a young girl standing inside a classroom, alone except for a corpse on the floor. When this male student walks in, all of a sudden, she feels compelled to leave through the window without immediacy or fear. The boyfriend and girlfriend at the end offer half-hearted protests, obviously showing they don't value their lives that much. The girl does a decent job, whimpering a little, but the boy is dreadful, throwing out lines without emotion, ""you sicko. why would you do this. you are terrible. you don't want to do this. you know you don't want to do this."" Wow.

The two killers were dreadful, although a little better because they didn't talk much. But boy, when they did, was it profound (note: sarcasm.) ""yeah, i did pretty good. i shot the principal and a few other people."" like he really doesn't care. He gets into the shower with the other killer saying, ""well, this is the day we're gonna die."" Unreal.

I know that this wasn't an exact parallel to Columbine or any other actual incident. But for crying out loud, do justice to today's average teenager...show some kind of feeling. They are not lifeless, emotionless robots. They are human beings who experience the broadest spectrum of such emotion, especially in high school, where drama prevails in nearly every situation (THIS is life, friend.) It doesn't do justice to any tragic event that compares, nor does it do justice to those experiencing this. There were victims whose brothers, sisters, best friends were present to see them be killed, and you heard little more than a peep out of them. The killers themselves were apathetic, like ""hey, what the hell. I'll just shoot off a few rounds,"" like they had no emotion tied to this event at all whatsoever.

This will never be a movie I show to my students, and not just for content's reason. I  believe in their feelings a little bit more than to degrade them with such a ridiculous film.",1132617600,5,3378,4.765811965811966
1994192,2,B0001EFUFK,"I was in 7th Grade when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold went on a rampage in their Colorado High School.  I remember my heavy-set science teacher reduced to tears, and I remember the crude wooden gun I carved in Industrial Arts being taken away from me out of concern that it might lead to me killing people (telling them my father was a hunter did not help matters).  The Columbine Event was a significant part of my life, and there is a film to be made about it.  However, ""Elephant"" is not it.

My primary complaint about Elephant is that it was so mundane.  Oh I do not mean that I wanted an explosion every five minutes, I mean I wanted dialogue and characterization.  I assumed the approach the director was going to take was a build-up of characters we (the audience) would care about, and then a shocking climax.  Instead I got stereotypes worse than in ""Scarecrow Gone Wild: He's the Death of the Party.""  We have a nerdy girl who works at the library, three attractive girls who throw up their lunch, two killers who have repressed homosexual tendencies and watch shows on the Nazis, a jock and his new attractive girlfriend, etc.  I hate calling a movie boring--it's so ignorant--but I was hard-pressed to get involved in this film.  There were no characters I liked, as a matter of fact there weren't any characters at all.  Just a few cariactures and cardboard cutouts.

The style of direction was also grating on the nerves and the eyes.  While a long-take can be great (i.e. Goodfellas) on its own, watching long-take after long-take was exceptionally annoying.  It got so bad that I started looking forward to cuts, which heretofore I took for granted.  Van Zant seems to be in love with every shot, being pretentiously artsy for the sake of doing so, and it was exceptionally irritating.  Further, no one seemed to care at all when two crazed killers were running amuck with deadly weaponry.  If someone could explain the actions of the black guy at the end (Benny?), you have my email.  Most-appreciated.

Some people have critisized the film for not offering a reason for such senseless violence, and while I understand their complaints, I have a more pressing one: If the writer/director could please craft an actual involving story, then I'll worry about the ""why."" *1/2 out of ****",1132272000,2,2301,4.67910447761194

It should be called Kids with no sense of purpose except ""long hall walking camera shots"" which really serve as no sense of direction or narration. I was completely disturbed by the gay shower sequence. To me this is another chance for Gus to exploit homosexuality , just as he did in The Last Days which is another failure for Gus as a director. To me these two movies are terribly offensive and not to prove a point either, just for the purposbee of adding some dramatic effect to two movies that  are terribly directed. I feel he is exploting two terribly disturbed children in Elephant. He does not really give us any sense of reasoning behind the shootings . He  shows a young watching Adolph Hitler films looking completely taken with with the whole Nazi life style and then in the next scene the same young man is in the shower waiting to have sex with the other co conspiritor of the shootings who he ultimately ends up shooting himself. Gus  must have a complete misunderstanding of Nazi beliefs. Adolph Hitler was openly against homosexulity. Does Gus have a problem with Homosexuality. Does Gus believe all Homosexuals are Gun weilding young handsome men who can't wait to get off with each other then run out to shoot up their school? What was the purpose of this film? The ending is just as terrible as every ""long hall walking "" sequence. I was  completely offended by this film and not in a good way. Not in a way that would make me want to learn more, or try and seek out the message of this film, which I believe this film has none. It was just a long walk to nothing.

At first, it plays like a Stanley Kubrick take on a school massacre with endless tracking shots following the students as they walk through their boring lives.  What dialogue is spoken is banal and poorly-improvised.  The film avoids easy choices...but it also refuses to make many choices at all, instead just hinting at things like plot and character development.

And the addition of a gay shower scene--something added by Van Sant that wasn't part of Columbine--makes me wonder what ELEPHANT was really trying to say.  (All the gay touches Van Sant poured into his pointless refilming of PSYCHO makes me wonder, along with making the killers in ELEPHANT gay, if there is some serious self-loathing going on here).

From what little we're given, we have to fill in the blanks with these killers, trying to find clues of bullying and isolation and rage...and then the shower scene appears.  Was this movie trying to say ANYTHING?

1994196,3,B0001EFUFK,"- REVIEW

1999 was a terrible year for Colorado.  A small high school named Columbine was forever defaced by two random outcasts packing heat.  It was a massacre beyond belief, with the outcasts committed the deaths of over 10 people, students and teachers alike.  The criminals were soon wasted by the SWAT and everything was apprehended, but no one, especially the students, can ever forget the bloodshed that flowed upon the floors of Columbine.  So how is it possible for first-time director Gus Van Sant to make the most tragic shooting in the school system look so incredibly boring?

The badly-titled ""Elephant"" follows that morbid event, as you all know.  Instead of following how the tragedy came to be at the start like most based-on-true-events movie, this movie give different perspectives during the event.  About 9 students I think, the geeks, jocks, prissies, and the ones responible for the event, gives their own separate point-of-view (except for the 3 girls that share only one) of what's happening in front of them.  Sometimes, some of these characters interject when they cross paths to one's POV. Pratically, it's a typical nothing's-happening day for these kids...except when the shooting starts.  Each of these characters have their own first name, and interestingly enough, their first names are similar to their real names.

I like the characters in story because they all look so convincingly real, the kind of students you would normally see in school.  This would have been a remarkable context to see these characters lived their lives right where the massacre, but as I find out, the only conclusive purpose for these kids to either die by the hands of the two outcasts or live and walk away with nothing.  This make caring for the characters highly irrelevant, even if it's intentional by the director's vision.  I DO have a complaint about one of the kids, who goes by Benny, who's got to be the dumbest black kid on earth who just blindingly walks towards his demise instead of hastenly avoiding it.  If he's based on a real murdered victim, I rather not go forward to disrespect the deceased.

Mr. Van Sant has a unique direction in this film, which is also his most flawed.  He uses cinematography to follow the  character's perspective no matter he or she goes, with very little scene change and editing involved (think of this as that video from Xzibit, ""What you see is what you get"").  This makes the film's scenery more subtle and natural.  Van Sant also has a habit of leaving the camera fixed on one view to give it some kind of nonchalant view.  These are also the problems with this film because they were too many of these moments and they were WAY too long and subtle.

The following-the-characters direction puts the word ""arbitrary"" on a high level, as I spend most of time watching characters being invisibly followed as they do mostly boring activities.  Adding to the drowsiness is the lengthy fixed camera scenes, which are either artistic expressive or incredibly lazy on the director's part; who actually wants to spend half a minute looking at the sky?  Even at 80 minutes, this movie has more unnecessary filler than the fourth season of InuYasha (anime fan, that I am).  One last complaint, what does the title ""Elephant"" have to do with the actual event?  Does it mean that big things can whimper at the sight of death?  What kind of subjective context is on Van Sant's easy-going mind when he came up with the title?

By the time the shooting actually happens, and it's kinda graphic, I was too exhausted to feel devastated about it.  In my experience watching this film, it felt like being eight years old and watching those old educational videos in Science class; slow and it feels like work.  If the director wants to envision a tragic nilch tale of Columbine, he should think less ""art"" and more ""narrative.""  ""Elephant"" is a intriguing film focusing on the nature side of the tragedy, so I give it the benefit of the doubt.  It's worth seeing it once just to get it out of the way, but as flawed as it is, there's no incentive to give it a second viewing.

This is Del Keyes, saying ""zzzzZZZZZ...goths shooting jocks...ZZZZzzzz""",1130284800,2,4194,4.780555555555556

(It reminded me of the movie ""Testament"" from about 20 years ago, which dealt with a nuclear attack on the U.S. in a similar fashion....no tugging at heartstrings or dramatic ""shock"" value, just stark realism of what it would probably really be like.) The only scene I found distracting was when the three ""popular girls"" go into the bathroom and perform a ""bulimic purge"" simultaneously in three separate toilet stalls. This came across as contrived to me and broke what had, up until that point, been a reasonably ""cinema verite"" experience. Overall, though, I found the film to be depressing (on a lot of levels...not just because of the violence) and chilling, both of which I would presume to be the desired impressions.",1129766400,2,815,4.746478873239437

If your're looking for a John Hughes film then don't bother. You really have to be in the right frame of mind to watch something like this & appreciate it. I loved the way Gus van Sant followed the characters around with a steadicam in a very mundane way. I was expecting this style to change once the violence began but it doesnt, instead Gus breaks typical hollywood tradition & films the acts of violence in the exact same mundane way which makes the violence even more horrific because the killers are so emotionally removed from what they're doing. I cant praise this movie enough, it did exactly what it was supposed to do & transported me into the hallways of an ordinary high school on an ordinary day where life & death hang in the balance within a matter of minutes.",1129766400,5,1057,4.539267015706806
1994199,5,B0001EFUFK,"Alright, I readily recognize that this film is probably not the best of the recent wave of school-shooting films, but seeing all this bogus negative press for ""Elephant"" really disheartens me.

We all know how it swept Cannes, but is that really a surprise...?  Any film made by Americans about how bad and violent America is, is immediately sucked off by French film critics solely for the purpose that it makes America look bad.  ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and its subsequent reception at Cannes is the ultimate example of that.  My question is: since when has America ever really looked good to foreigners?

I'll be the first to shout that ""Elephant"" is not as realistic as it ought to be, however unless YOU PERSONALLY attended Columbine High School in Littleton, CO on that fateful day of 4/20/99, you effectively cannot state accurate assumptions of realistic teenage behavior.  Sorry, you're not qualified.  I know I'm not.

1) the big black kid strolling nonchalantly as the hallway burns... was probably gonna try to talk him into giving up the gun instead of just jumping an armed assailant, that would've been a stupider move.

2) the endless piano playing... the point of this scene is what the player does as he finishes the phrase while his buddy jumps on the laptop.  do you remember?  the duality of killers.

I'll make this review quick.  ""Elephant"" is all about atmosphere, not plot.  Shortcuts are taken with the gay display, Fuhrer propoganda films, violent video games, etc.  It seems a too neat and tidy, maybe repetitive package.  What you are missing out on is that Harris Savides' half-lit and HAUNTING photography attempts to reconstruct not the event, but the environment that became victim to the event.  To this end, I found the photography spiritual, the acting broad (non-professionals, mind you), the crescendo is not intense because of the 15-minute time frame that loops back on itself.

Even after all that, I was thoroughly immersed in - at least - my high school all over again for roughly 80 minutes thanks to ""Elephant.""  The superficial girls spouting off how many grams of fat in salad dressing; the unattractive, quiet girl working the library; the gay photographer working on his portfolio; the skater kid with a drunken dad he's ashamed of; the preppie couple getting ready for forerunning... it's all real.  They were all in my high school, anyway...  I knew most of them.

Alright, the endless shots... people, the first thing any Film 101 instructor ought to tell you is that long-takes (put to extensive use in this film) are presented dependent upon story progression and emotional conveyance.  Don't get bored with the character that the camera is following, that's not why the camera focuses on him to begin with.  Instead, observe the area around him as he walks through it.  High school all over again... you've just gotta pay close attention.

Sorry, this one tries to make you think and recall, not help you get your kicks as you mentally plaster your face over the killers' and enjoy some fantasy-revenge played out on a movie screen, just so you can't get in trouble.  That's a selfish and disturbing attitude to have.  The final shot sums up everything Van Sant attempted to hint at beforehand: this a lyrical, dreamy lament seeped in uncertainty.  An ode to ALL THE CHILDREN in high school... who can only play at being adults... and the game of death gets lost in the transition.

Take it all in... don't expect a steady and increasing episodic barrage of sensational turmoil coming to a head.  You might find a rather sad film that in itself cannot make sense of such real-life violence.

I was in highschool when columbine and the other school shootings of that time happened and this just showed how unexpected these events can happen. Other reviewers have stated the the problems some of these children face are seemingly trivial. These people need to understand that these are very real problems and can lead to frightening conclusions. No matter how trivial it may seem, people take things to heart, like the girl in the movie who overhears the other girls making fun of her in the locker room and you later follow her through the halls and it sounds as if she is crying, or the boy who has to take over driving from his drunk father.

1994205,1,B0001EFUFK,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen, both in matters of art and meaning.  The script (or lack of one) alone was bad enough.  If I had been watching this movie in a theater, I would have walked out.  As I was watching it on DVD, I fast-forwarded through 80% of it.  Elephant centers around high school kids walking down halls, and people will tell you that this is supposed to emphasize how boring life is.  Well that's just fine, if the director wasn't making money off of showing us this.  Did I expect Die Hard when I rented this movie?  No, in fact I expected to see very little shooting.  I expected a thoughtful look at why high-schoolers shoot their classmates, and my God did I ever not get that.  People will also tell you that this movie is for those that were outcasts and were picked on in high school.  As one of these people, I am outraged at how Elephant treated this subject.

Elephant is just bursting at the seams with American teenage stereotypes.  Even as someone who will forever hate the preppy girls that I had to put up with in high school, I was still horrified at the mass purging that took place in a bathroom in this movie.  If Van Sant was intending to make a movie so ingrained in reality, as so many people claim, then what better way to show reality than by representing young teenage girls with, out of allll these kids at this school, these three girls who vomit up the three pieces of lettice that they had for lunch!  And then there's the good old desensitized nature of our American kids, represented by the photographer snapping a picture of the two gun-toting guys instead of, oh, telling people to run or something.

And then there's the homosexuality.  I can't believe that Van Sant, as a homosexual himself, gave such a ridiculous picture of these two shooters.  Was there really a necessary reason to display the two as homosexual?  If this was meant to reflect Columbine, Harris and Klebold were not gay, this had been a rumor made up after the shootings.  This tells me that Van Sant made no attempt whatsoever to investigate actual school shootings before making this movie.  I'm surprised these two weren't listening to Rammstein and Marilyn Manson as they (extensively) walked down the hallways in trench coats.

Elephant didn't show hardly any reasons behind WHY these shooters did what they did.  There is one short scene of ONE of the shooters getting pummeled with spitballs, the other shooter comes out of nowhere and may not even attend the school.  As there's so little dialogue in the film, we never learn anything about him beyond the fact that he may be gay and he likes to watch documentaries on Hitler.

Oh yes, Hitler.  How absurd is it to show two homosexual lovers, one of them perhaps partly Asian, watching footage of Hitler?  Are we just supposed to believe that these kids are idiots or is it that Van Sant knows absolutely nothing about Hitler's philosophies and just assumes that all violent people, regardless of race, love Hitler?

Again, we know nothing about these shooters.  The kid that we see in school apparently has a loving mother that makes him pancakes in the morning, so I guess we'll just have to assume that he gets all his violent tendencies from that asinine video-game we see the shooters playing.  As if we didn't have to hear enough of this from the media, even movies have to completely divert attention away from ""Where the hell were the parents?"" to ""Video games make kids kill each other.""  And you're telling me this is reality?

Who are these kids?  Not just the shooters, but any of them?  I don't know, all I saw was a parade of them walking down hallways.  Van Sant had to show us that life was boring.  No, this is poor storytelling, pure and simple.  Even in reality, people are different.  This is why movies show the personalities of people, what they like, what they hate, how they react to situations.  This is why people don't like movies that don't let you know anyone involved in the plot, because who cares about some person they saw walking down the street?  This is what I saw as I watched this movie: a bunch of people walking by, and I was never allowed to get to know any of them.  Who are these girls?  I don't know, I only saw them arguing with each other and throwing up in the bathroom.  Who is this guy with the camera?  I don't know, but he sure as hell likes to take pictures.  Who is this girl?  I don't know, but she doesn't like wearing shorts.  Who is this guy?  I don't know, but from what I can tell he's a token black guy that gets killed 2 minutes after we first see him because he doesn't have enough sense to get out of the school when he sees lockers on fire and classmates climbing out the windows.  Who are these shooters?  Answer: Two gay guys who play too many video games, and who in the end don't care about each other at all.  This is reality?

I was in high school when Columbine happened.  Our school went insane that year.  Something had to be done about school shootings, but what?  Get more involved with parents?  Counsel students on problems they're facing?  Develop programs teaching teenagers to be more tolerant?  Discuss the warning signs that were at Columbine and inform teenagers AND TEACHERS on what to watch for?  No, their answer was to charge every student $5 to wear a nametag.  I saw a reflection of this philosophy in Elephant: teenagers will be teenagers, and their poor parents and teachers just aren't able to keep up with their madness.  I keep hearing that there's no moral in Elephant, because it reflects REALITY.  The reality of Columbine had a moral: Teenagers aren't coping with modern life, and we need to talk to them.  Elephant had a moral too: Beware of that gay kid you throw spit balls at in class, cause he might play video games.",1129248000,13,5810,4.5014354066985645

1994208,2,B0001EFUFK,"In High School, there were always those kids, sometimes only a couple, that kept to themselves & carried with them a spiral notebook of poetry they've written... They called themselves 'poets' & in those notebooks contained  some of the worst poetry ever written aswell.  The people who enjoy this movie or think its artistic, including Gun Van Sant himself, were/are those same kids.

Ok, you want-to-be artsy posers, I ""got"" it - This movie reflects life as it happens, no real special effects or unrealistic story lines...

With that said, there's no good excuse to show one kid walking down a hall for 5 minutes straight - It's not artsy, or thought provoking, it's boring

Tell me something.. how is using that SAME 5 minutes to show the same kid doing DIFFERENT every day things such as talking to his family? or playing a video game less artsy than showing him walking down a hall for 5 minutes?

Gus Van Sant is lazy.  He couldve made just as realistic of a movie by showing 1 character doing different every day things & maybe talking more, so we can feel more attatched to the character & the effect of the movie is more felt at the end, than showing the same character doing basically one thing - & quite frankly, PEOPLES LIVES ARENT REALLY THIS BORING, this movie is like a purposeful exaggeration on how boring life can get - Hardly any teenagers ive known had lives this boring.

I suppose showing one scene for 5 minutes at a time makes for easier movie making, but it certainly doesnt help in creativity.

This is lazy film making, no excuses.  Also for you artsy posers, being lazy is the opposite of art, maybe you failed poets should understand the difference between art & being uncreative.

The ending is good, while it lasts, which is why I give it 2 stars.

I don't care if 'Sin City', 'Batman', or 'The 6th Sense' had more action & weren't realistic, they were much more artistic than this movie

Oh & please.. the beginning & the end of the film where he's showing the clouds moving in fast motion?  How much more cliche can you get? the X-Files did that on FOX about 10 years ago Gussy.",1128902400,2,2112,4.509186351706036
1994209,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant has a very fascinating way of storytelling. It's an 80 minute movie, but all action takes place within roughly a 10 minute span of time. The camera steadicams with one character and we see how that character interacts with others, then chronologically restarts and steadicams with the next character who may interact with previous characters we've seen as well.

These 10 minutes are quite Columbineish. The massacre doesn't take place until the end of the movie when the steadicam follows the shooters, but you know early on that it's coming.

Here's something to pay attention to though, if you need something to ponder. Pay careful attention to all the students during the shooting. You'll notice that they all act relatively calm and when flocks of students are running through the school to get out the tension and panic levels are rather subdued. When one student gets shot at a after-school club meeting, no-one freaks out, and the teacher is rather calm and collected as he tries to give aid to the student. In a different scene where another student gets shot, a nearby photography student very calmly raises his camera and takes a picture. Something is trying to be said in that choice of performance direction.

There are no elephants in this movie (or even a mention of one), but if I were to hesitate a guess I'd say the title ""Elephant"" refers to the axiom about ""The elephant in the living room that everyone notices but no-one says anything"".",1128470400,,1467,4.836653386454183
1994210,5,B0001EFUFK,"An aspiring and self-confident photographer. A shy and homely girl who doesn't like to undress in front of her peers in Gym class. A trio of gossiping bulimics. A boy who has be responsible by leaving his car keys in the main office for his brother to pick up, because his father is drunk. The boy's girlfriend, who participates in the GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance) at her school. A popular football player/lifeguard and his gorgeous girlfriend. And two best friends - one, a sketch artist/pianist and the other, a slacker - who will shoot the school. All played by non-professional actors.

We see the characters interact - whether it be in passing in the halls or idle gossiping. We follow them throughout what seems to be a normal day as though we're walking directly behind them, yet we do not sympathize with them when most of them are inevitably killed during a school shooting that will occur later. The movie is distant and detached - yet, there's a chilling fragile touch to it that draws you in; perhaps it's the Beethoven tinkling during the scenes, the hunched tension building throughout the movie, the loose improvisation in order to provide a more realistic approach to the movie, or Harris Savides' breathtakingly beautiful cinematography. Or all of the above.

Many reviewers found this movie ""pointless"" or ""boring."" Perhaps they were looking for an action-packed thriller with dramatic suicides, snarky comedy and a nice denouement at the end that would miraculously reveal all the motives as well as what happens in the aftermath.

This movie isn't pointless or boring at all. The boredom might have stemmed from the film being drawn-out at times, but that's only because the action is realistic. There aren't any shortcuts in real life. The characters can't be expected to teleport from place to place or time travel in order to skip the five-minute walks throughout various hallways or the long and trivial conversations. And when the killers, Alex and Eric, gear up in camouflage and begin the shootings, Gus van Sant doesn't provide a solid reason as to why they decided to kill, which makes this film as mind-boggling as it is.

And that's the point of this movie. In past (real) school shootings such as the one in Columbine, Marilyn Manson and violent video games were blamed. Some thought the pair of killers were homosexuals; their sexual orientation also made into scapegoats. Gus van Sant shows us that people, in general, are ignorant. He tempts us into prejudging and making assumptions with scenes such as Alex and Eric passively watching a film about Nazis on TV (the WWII documentary, ironically, stating things such as propaganda swaying people's perspectives and people believing everything that is fed to them), playing graphically bloody computer games, Alex having spitballs being shot at him in class, and the pair sharing a kiss in a shower stall (Alex: ""I never even kissed anybody before."") on the shooting day.

The movie ends with one killer - Alex - still standing with virtually everyone either shot or escaped; coldly eeny-meeny-miny-moing who to kill next. The other one, Eric, was shot by Alex. We don't know why - we will never know why so we will guess, because no one can truly delve into someone's mind and suddenly understand everything; the motives, the execution, everything (this impossibility of fathoming, in turn, leading to the blaming and assuming that we, as people, do naturally).

The film provokes us to blame and to presume. But most of all, it encourages us to think.",1127520000,3,3536,4.944444444444445
1994211,1,B0001EFUFK,"The 81 minutes worth of footage captured in this film isn't a movie, because it has no storyline. I didn't say it had a horrible storyline or unbelievably bad plot, it has NO storyline at all, I'm not exaggerating.

This movie is like watching 71 minutes of security cam footage from a bank, where the last 10 minutes shows a bank robbery. For 71 minutes, you watched customer after customer do their business with the bank teller, then finally in the end you watch the robbery take place.

Another example, let's say you took a camcorder to school or work with you, and you decide to just start filming little random things that happen throughout the day, after gathering 81 minutes worth of film filled with your co-workers, break room, bathroom, etc., do you think this footage you gathered is worthy to be released as a MOTION PICTURE? Are you kidding me? Who the hell would want to see such pointless footage other than you or the people you filmed?

This very forgettable movie Elephant bores you to death with the first 70 minutes or so showing random people doing random things in a random high school, and you never care for any of them. It features such pointless actions such as: watching a kid walk down a hall for 5 minutes as he passes other people, watching girls eat lunch and talk about 100% irrelevant things, and you get to watch guys throw a football around for 5 minutes. None of this is connected in any way to a storyline, and to make it worse, these actions go on far too long, that's what takes up the bulk of the movie. It also has some very unrealistic acting near the end when the actual school shooting takes place (just look at people's reactions), but I won't harp on that, since I only expect good acting from actual movies.

Obviously I can see they're trying to depict how an average ordinary day at an ordinary high school with ordinary students can be affected by an extraordinary event, tragically affecting the innocent lives of everyone there. The problem with this type of storytelling is it makes it incredibly boring, and 0% entertaining. It doesn't matter if I'm watching this in 2005, or in 1999 when Columbine took place, it doesn't change the fact that this movie is a 100% piece of namesake crap. With no character development or story arc, you may as well look out the window for an hour and a half, that'll have the same amount of plot, possibly slightly more entertaining because you may spot someone you know.",1127001600,,2460,4.571428571428571

It follows the story of a typical day in high school- gone awry when two loners decide they've had enough. It's a sort of post-Columbine film, and is really heartfelt and emotional at times. I loved the simple and eye-catching cinematography of this movie, and the acting was superb. Well done. This probably wasn't helpful, but you really ought to see Elephant anyways. It's become one of my friends and my favorite movies, not that that helps any more than what I said before. Oh well, just see it. :-)",1126569600,,665,4.6440677966101696
1994213,5,B0001EFUFK,"I'm from Colorado, so I've experienced the Columbine Shooting's aftermath first hand. It was scary and very very sad. But the worst part was, it could've been stopped. This movie is similar to the idea that shootings like this can be stopped, but then it's not. Some people complain that the movie was boring and prententious garbedge. I say that's not so. It all really depends on what you went through in high school and what you like in movies. I felt a link to some of the characters more than others, and maybe that's why I liked this movie so much.

Mainly, it's about a simple, average high school day...Except that it's not. And as the day escalates, and you realize already what's going to happen to certain characters at certain times, it becomes evident how much the littlest things can make people snap. The thing I absolutely loved about Elephant was the fact it rewound certain events twice, sometimes three times and showed the each event from a different perspective. I just thought that was really cool. It made you see every aspect of one situation in a new light.

This movie isn't action-packed. It's not a tense thriller. It's just a day in high school that goes wrong. The more you analyze the movie, the more you hate it ( I should know, I spent about a day and a half wondering why the kids massacred people like they did when I realized that it really doesn't matter.) This is more like a documentary. Which is why I found it nice. There wasn't music blaring. There wasn't serious chases or any of that. It was a quiet film. It was different.

So, you know, liking this movie is all a matter of taste. Almost to anyone, though, I suggest this movie.",1122595200,2,1674,4.5
1994214,5,B0001EFUFK,"I've wanted to see this film ever since it first came out around 2003/2004. Finally, i've seen the movie and i understand why so many people are so divided about it. I feel it's very much an aquired taste, the sort of film that goes over some people's heads because either they had higher expectations or just weren't able to get into it for whatever reason. I sat down and watched this movie expecting it to be really bad, i told myself this, and when the movie ended i just thought..What an amazing film. It's definitely a movie that makes you think, but it also makes you feel empty and that's what i think Gus Van Sant was trying to convey.

The movie can be described as ""artsy"", or ""trying too hard"" in some ways, and i really do understand why people feel that way. There's definitely parts in the film that do drag on a little bit longer than usual. But that's what it is, it's supposed to be real, everyday life and i think Gus Van Sant has done a great job at capturing that image.

Another thing about this film is that i notice some reviewers are comparing this to the Columbine Massacre of April 1999. The thing is, it's only based on those events and the events of other school shootings too. It simply tries to give an insight into how shocking the reality of an unexpected school shooting is like. And it also gives an insight into everyday school life, how teenagers interact and how the many cliques (Jocks, Nerds, Goths..) interact with eachother as well. What eventually happens is a school shooting, and the fact everyone watching this knows this is going to happen just adds to the tension. The way this film follows one character through the whole day, up until the shooting, then cuts and follows the next character the same way, is just brilliant in my opinion.

As i said, there's alot of tension through-out. And even the shots from behind of the characters walking around the school grounds..which go for a fair few minutes most of the time..has you wondering every step of the way how things will happen. How the characters will somehow link together in the end. And when the shooting is actually taking place, the acting is quite good and 'real' in a sense. Although a downside of this film is that everyone is mostly an 'unkown', which leads to the acting being poor in a few scenes, i really think the cast did a great job.

The Extras on this DVD are the ""Theatrical Trailer"", which i suggest you watch before watching the actual movie..but either way is fine, ""Gus Van Sant's Filmography"", which just details the films Gus Van Sant has directed in his career (Good Will Hunting, To Die For, My Own Private Idaho, Finding Forrester..etc), and also ""On The Set of Elephant: Rolling Through Time"" (Which i haven't watched yet).

All in all..this is a highly recommended film to everyone that likes movies that makes them think, and are willing to sit through some of these extended scenes that seem to stretch on a bit too long but in reality just keep the tension building. Open-minded people who lower their expectations should get the most out of this.",1121990400,2,3086,4.553153153153153

Not to mention the last 10 minutes of the film, which half of them filled with piano playing.. and yes! The shower scene is best and awaking up scene of all! One boy went in the shower minutes before shooting, with his murder-mate joining him saying a dum sentence like ""I never kissed before.."" and then the two of them kissing for a few seconds.. that's it.

I won't even mention the shooting scene which is the worst part.

However, this film helped me to vividly bring back the dysfunctional aspects of high school life: the shallow social cliques, the weird walks through the hallway, indifferent faculty, etc. I also grew up in Oregon with its rapidly changing weather and moods, about 50 miles North of where a similar school rampage took place at Springfield High School.

The individual student's portrayal seemed very honest even if there was a contrived overabundance of problems such as drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, and eating disorders.

In Elephant, the random fragments of individual lives had no meaning as a whole. The final scene spoke for the entire film, that is, abrupt, and totally random with no purpose. I viewed Elephant hoping to gain insight into why teenage boys would perform such horrible acts. I learned nothing new.

In sum, Elephant is interesting but pointless.",1121385600,,916,5.134228187919463

Secondly, if you don't apprectiate filming techniques and symbology and everything behind films, then you probably won't like the film either. This isn't an enjoyable film, it's very emotional and beautiful.

Me, I didn't find this boring at all. I think the reason it's filmed the way it is is because it shows us that it's just an ordinary day, and then it changes completely. Gus Van Sant builds an amazing contrast.

I think this film is brilliant. When the two guys with the guns came into the library and started shooting wearing no expressions on their faces at all, that was when I understood how the people who experienced the columbine shooting must have felt. I was really pulled into this movie and felt just how horrific it must have been.

I'm so glad that I didn't listen to my friends when they told me not to get it out because it was ""soooo boring and it is the stupidest movie I have ever seen""

But there is something else... you should rather go for ""Zero Day"" by Ben Coccio, which is a wonderfull, though shocking movie about the same massacre at Columbine High. It`s a low budget film, shot way before the Elephant that won three grand jury prizes, which somehow even manages to empathize with the executers. Carefully staged and directed, it takes us into their lives and seduces by their humor, directness, and humaneness of their condition and their single-mindedness. Zero Day points no finger and wisely leaves it to us to judge its characters.",1120435200,2,767,4.9921875
1994219,5,B0001EFUFK,"This isn't a typical movie. I'm pretty sure that I never have seen anything like it. Nor have you in all likelyhood.

Life is boring most of the time, completely unlike movies, that cut from action packed scene to dramatic scene. Life isn't like that, at all.

A day at a high school, could be any high school in America. The camera follows several people, at one point their names appear on the screen in white on black, and you get glimpses into the students lives. Parts of conversations, mostly meaningless drivel, and you don't feel like you've gotten to know them. Hell, sometimes you feel nothing for the characters.

Haven't you felt like that towards someone, ever? Walked past people (I'm speaking in terms of school here, now) in hallways without looking at them. You feel nothing towards them. You aren't attached, and you know nothing about them except maybe their name.

Well, that's how it is in this film. You don't get to know the persons portrayed. And yes, there are several situations that seem as though they should go somewhere. Bad home lives and such.  But they go nowhere.

Eric and Jared are bullied. Ignored. Spitballed regularly. They come up with a 'plan'. You know what's going to happen, we all know. It's somewhat inevitable as it's REAL LIFE. No nice caring stranger will become your immediate and best friend and convince you not to kill everyone. No on intervenes.

It's chilling, how we can sit and watch a massacre such as that, and feel nothing. We didn't care about the people that were shot.

The camera observes, it doesn't exactly tell. It doesn't give background stories or anything like that. It just watches, mostly the backs of peoples heads, as a day progresses.

An issue I'd like to address, is a scene where Eric and Jared do kiss in the shower. HELLO. Homosexuality didn't cause them to kill. ""I've never even kissed anyone."" The sadness, does it escape you? They know they will die (suicide? kill themselves or each other?) and don't want to do so without being kissed.

I've always been interested in what makes us commit senseless acts of violence and by examining the back over, I thought it might give me some insight into what makes kids kill kids. I was wrong. It didn't give me any insight at all, because, realistically, it does not matter. All that matters is that it happens and there are ways to prevent this sort of thing from happening every year at schools. I'm glad that this movie didn't focus too much on the killers, because that's where the mainstream directors would have gone and that's what the mainstream audience would've wanted. Instead, it focuses on one particular day of high school where the unthinkable happens. It follows particular students around the hallways, on the playing field, in the classrooms, at the cafeteria, etc. and we see them as we saw ourselves when we were in high school. The total nonsense we talked about, the admiration of false heroes, the teasings of the inferior, etc. Some of the students the camera follows know each other, some haven't been aquainted but none of them know what lies in store for them. And that's the thing I liked about this little gem of a film. Once we started to get to know one of the characters, it would switch to another character so we didn't get too deeply involved with them. We don't need to know everything about their lives.

My wife felt the movie moved too slow but i thought it was well paced.  He did a great job of capturing lesser known facts about high school kids and suceeded on many levels of pegging certian kids and clicks.

Now for the bad.  The acting was awful and i mean terrible.  I would be shocked if we ever heard from any of these pretty faces again because that is ALL they had to offer.  The dialogie was great but so poorly delivered that you would think you were watching a high school play rather than a movie.  Also, the actors they got to play the roles of high school students were very inconsistant at best.  SOme of the actors looked like they were pushings mid 30's while others were more believable.  One thing i fould out of place were the large number of homosexuals in this movie.  For a movie that is suposed to be filmed in any highschool in America i was shocked at the numbers of gay actors in this film.  Well, either there was an unrealistic number of gay charecters or too many poor gay actors used in this movie (probably the later judging by the performances).  I was also very let down by the ending, the film has a snowballing suspense to it and then it melts.  If youve seen this movie then you know what im saying if you haven't prepared to be let down at the end.

Final thoughts-  I wanted to like this movie and i did at times but as an overall film i think its fails as much as it suceeds.  FOr every moment of truth in the film there is an unmistakable lie that discredits the films honest moments imho.",1119571200,,1692,4.188854489164087

I recommend this to anyone who is interested by events like Columbine (not the death bit, the happenings behind it...) cuz this is it.

Basically the film follows a handful of students through the same day, and how their paths cross (both knowingly and unknowingly) and eventually come together in a startling ending.

If you are overly sensitized to this topic, having lost anyone to such an event, I wouldn't recommend seeing this...it's very graphic...

I don't have a problem with long silences,but I think Mr. Van Sant overdid it. The characters are the types that you wouldnt care about (probably except John).It is just empty. If its directly based from Columbine,its passable because it could be a fictionalized story about it but since this movie is purely a work of fiction (based on the end credits),this is nothing but a lame movie not to mention predictable,once I saw two guys with the guns,the entirety of it is pretty much a waste of time since I already know whats going to happen.",1119398400,,1148,4.519230769230769

1994226,4,B0001EFUFK,"""Elephant"" captures the reality of daily high school life near perfectly. The movie flows through parallel timelines, so it can be a bit confusing at first, but once you realize that you are seeing the same period of time through another character's perspective the film comes together beautifully. True, there are many shots following one character through the halls, doing nothing else but walking. But, suprisingly, these are not dull. They are hypnotic. They lull you into a sense of routine and security almost. These students have walked these halls hundreds of times on hundreds of days and nothing has disrupted them...until this day.

The violence that befalls the school is not shocking...we see it coming. What is fabulous to watch is the confusion of the inhabitants of the school when the catastrophe begins. They have no idea what is going on and several are snuffed before they figure it out.

What I find unsatisfying about an otherwise remarkable film is the ending...there is no real conclusion. I tend to like a little more closure to my movies than ""Elephant"" offers.

The young actors of ""Elephant"" are excellent and Gus Van Sant's direction is commendable. Some of the scene changes jarred the flow, but they were few and definitely forgivable. A fine film, indeed.",1118966400,,1287,5.0046728971962615

I think this is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Horrible events like what`s this film based on will usually get dramaticed by ruthless filmmakers with absolute no intension to explore it  seriously under the surfice but definetely exploit peoples natural interests on sensational subjects. Van Sant does it properly. He just settles to show the events and doesn`t too much justify or seek the factors behind the acts of the final massacre. Camera sure follows alienated teenagers but they mostly end up to be collateral. Actually there`s no any specific maincharacter and so everything might seem somehow meanless but same time this reflects the real life. This movie is not about entertainment but it really succes to give viewer a smallscale-picture of that living hell which we`ll always fail to really understand.

1994229,1,B0001EFUFK,"I could not even sit through this tripe. Wasn't it enough when Van Sant soiled the legacy of PSYCHO? No, someone had to let him make this dull, pointless crapola.
Ten minute long segments of teens walking around with no dialouge. Then when there is dialouge it's mumbled and useless. Then we are treated to scenes where the camera circles around kids playing football, talking about stuff (nothing of relevance at all, ever) and walking, walking, walking, walking, walking. My girlfriend and I got up and were making food in the kitchen while the movie still played. For a good twenty minutes we could hear it but not see it. There was no dialouge whatsoever and whenever one of us would check in on it, people would be walking around. I guess in the school this takes place in there are no classes and people are free to roam the halls.
Early on we get a feeling of impending doom as Gus shows us one underdeveloped, depthless character after another, lining them up for disaster when two black clad kids named Eric and Alex enter the school carrying huge duffle bags. Ooohhh ... Suttle!
Then we watch people walk around for another hour. I found myself wanting to see every one of them get butchered just so they would stop walking and just so something, anything, would happen. I even fast forwarded to when the shootings began, but the scenes of violence are so void of panic and dread because there has been no suspense and the audience has been made to feel absolutely nothing for the characters other than mild disdain. I had to turn it off. I could not sit through it.
This was plotless garbage that leaned on the dramatic reality of a school shooting for support and somehow managed to make a topic that extreme seem boring as hell. Perhaps if there was some backstory about the hierarchy of the school, with jocks and geeks and goths and such, and maybe if we had gotten to know the shooters or the victims in a way other than learning that they all know how to walk, then perhaps this could have worked, provided that a director with a smidge of talent took hold and Gus Van Sant was tossed out on the street so he could marvel at himself walking home.

The scenes in Elephant aren't punctuated by an orchestral track. They don't rush to the next climax and lead you to fill in the blanks. They don't dismiss the routine or mundane in life, because we all know that these are the spaces in which we are revealed to be most human.

That has been the main criticism of this film. It does not pathologize. It does not deploy neat and simple lables that assure us that violence is evil and exceptional, institutions are moral, and how we live our lives is free, just, and okay. These are the labels that make commodity and complacency intelligible, but Van Stant spares the viewer the the theatrics of empire.

The result is real, touching, and conciliatory. Only by stepping back and realizing our common alienation, dislocation, and vulnerability can we begin to see how restricting the conventions of most commercial cinema are in our views of other people.

As you are transported to Anywhere USA at Anytown High School you are taken into the world of youth. Youth, who like any student, are captured in the day to day life of class, friends, torment, and gym-class. Seems mundane, but life can be at times.

Creators protesting their innocence must recognize their culpability in perpetuating the pathological realities they depict.  They decline to counterbalance the depiction with a moral tone that these acts are evil.  This they claim under the cover of honesty, objectivity, and artistic freedom.  I am sure we know their protest to such criticism- ""Don't shoot the messenger for delivering the bad message for what is really happening out there.""

Such protests decline to accept responsibility for how such portrayals influence behavior.  Such movies participate in and reinforce the pathological realities they depict.

This week, a troubled 16 year old rented this film in Minnesota and repeatedly watched it- especially the gore scenes.  Shortly thereafter Jeff Weise killed 9 people before killing himself, including his grandparents and schoolmates.

Palm d'Or goes to director Gus Van Sant for this artistry.  Don't participate with this ""honest depiction of reality"".  The irrefutable fact is that this film played a part in manufacturing the reality of Jeff Weise, and the perpetuators of this reality should not profit from it.

1994234,5,B0001EFUFK,"On April 20, 1999, in Littleton, Colorado, the worst school massacre in American history took place at Columbine High School. The attack was perpetrated by two kids who were social outcasts in their school, and felt that the only way they could get even and send a message was to march into school armed with guns and bombs and kill everyone and anyone who got in their way. Now here we have Elephant, a film that depicts an eerily similar, but fictitious, day at a high school that might be any high school in our country.

This film's brilliance is in its simplicity. The camera follows around normal kids as they do what normal kids do on any normal school day: they go to class, eat lunch in the cafeteria, and talk about boys and girls and birds and bees. Only, when a pair of boys show up toting black bags and dressed in camouflage, we know this is no ordinary day.

Elephant does not tell a story; it simply observes. The long tracking shots follow different kids around as they walk through the halls and say ""hey"" to their friends, or eat lunch and talk about what they'll do after school, or how much they hate their parents because they won't let them do anything.

And all the while, the suspense builds, because we know what's coming, and these are nice kids, some of them a little shallow maybe, but kids with good intentions, with bright futures that are about to be crushed because inevitably some kids are less popular than others, and can't handle it.

So what about the killers themselves? They're uncool. They sit in class and get junk thrown at them by the cool kids - the jocks - and don't say anything. Their anger builds inside while their faces show indifference. They watch programs about Hitler, and play video games where the goal is to kill people with a shotgun. Is this why they chose to kill? The movie doesn't say; it observes these things happen. And we observe it too, and we wonder.",1110153600,4,1919,4.489971346704871

1994236,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant was a little too ""real"" for many tastes.  I didn't enjoy the film as I watched it the first time, but thought van Sant did (as always) a terrific job presenting what he wanted to present - if not necessarily my type of movie.  The film hasn't left me and the more I think about it - and rewatch it, the better it becomes.

Initially I felt the sense of ennui was a tad overdone watching the back of a student's head as he slowly moves from point A to point B - sometimes for endless minutes on end the camera will not break from that vantage point - the back of a head.  The point seemed made both literally and succinctly the first time.  Nonetheless, this device frees the narrative and affords van Sant opportunity to move his film in non-linear directions so the glimpse of a face unseen earlier is now viewed in full relief, a snatch of conversation previously heard comes into focus - even if briefly.

There are elements of the film that are touching and keenly observant.  While van Sant has typically focused on youth for his body of work, these elements are evident in all ages but noticeably and most strongly pronounced in youth, those hormone filled, confusing years where, completely unbeknownst to us, its victims, life is pretty much going to be the same, and one can change high school for the factory, the hospital, the law firm, the insurance company or wherever you spend your days and those with whom you spend them.

As with life, some characters will stay with you, some you'd wish to know better, others (the three bulimic girlfriends) who natter on endlessly about nothing - and whose existence one forgets entirely - until the next encounter.

There is more than a little heartbreak in Elephant.  Watching Alex pelted with spitballs made me cringe with remorse.  There is little reason to understand why Alex, and his sort of friend Eric, are losers.  There is outwardly no reason they don't fit in, something we see in everyday life:  people arbitrarily shunned because as a society we simply need people to be excluded.  As the boys share a shower and prepare for the shooting spree - and death - Eric's statement ""I've never even kissed anyone"" resounds with a loneliness that is shattering.

Had I written this review upon first watching Elephant I would've given it two stars.  Seeing it again, and thinking and talking about it lots, earns it 5.",1108339200,21,2386,4.618483412322274
1994237,5,B0001EFUFK,"Before I write anything else about the film, I would say that don't I really care for pretentious art films which sacrifice storytelling material for the sake of the style.

However, Elephant is an outstanding film because the ""walking through the hallways for thirty minutes"" shots portray life as it is. Life is not like it is in movies. It is boring. I for one, believe it's chilling to see such real realism, especially with this subject matter. Most movies have quick cuts to the next scene, which speeds up the pace, but makes it less like life. Elephant actually is good storytelling because it shows a school shooting that is so believable, you might think you're watching a real one in your living room.

Some reviewers said that the film was blaming homosexuality and violent video games as the ""cause"" for the shootings. The key word is ""cause"" since in actuality the movie blames no one component of these boy's lives or society. If the movie was blaming one thing on the shooting it would not be as vague. Elephant is full of shots of High School students having random conversations, unrelated to each other. In movies with a clear message, the dialoge usually goes somewhere.

Elephant is almost a complete slice of life, which is hard for any movie to accomplish.",1108166400,3,1279,4.726457399103139
1994238,5,B0001EFUFK,"""Elephant"" is perhaps the most intensely realistic and true-to-life account of the typical American high school, to date. Basically, the film has little central plot other than following the lives of two young outcasts-turned-massacrers.

The overwhelming truth of what social ridicule and rejection does to a person--especially in a high school setting--is put, through Van Sant's camera, very boldly, but with an emotional detachment to any of the characters.

Audience becomes one with students, and come to view the behavior of modern teens as an image that simply IS, and not somthing we are meant to feel or understand. Inspired by the Columbine tragedy, the ""story,"" (if there is one) follows several students through thier day-to-day ho-hum lives at a generalized high school.

Several stomach-turning subjects are addressed (I won't give away the double-entente there), but are unavoidably a truth that Van Sant passionately films with a lethargy that's not rare with documentaries today.

The direction on Van Sant's part is precise, with music that emphasizes the ""THE-TRUTH-IS-OUT-THERE"" theme, most significantly with Beetholven's 'Moonlight Sonata,' and the acting is as real as it gets for non-actors.

Consider the fact that ""Elephant"" was filmed within a few months, at an actual (and functioning) high school, with actual acting-inept students, and on an almost entirely improvisational script. With this, one can see how 'real' ""Elephant"" honestly is.

For those who tire easily, you may fall asleep and miss the gut-wrenching finale (think Columbine, people), but on the whole, this film is a blast, uh, literally.

The only part worth picketing is the scene concerning Eric and Alex's kiss in the shower.

Van Sant's implication is not that the two were gay, but that they knew of thier upcoming suicide and hadn't ever kissed anyone prior (Yes, even I was confused.)

I give the film five stars cheifly due to it's genuine thematic elements, breathtaking camerawork, and uncompromised depiction of the high school as it should be.

There will likely never be another time in my life as chilling, horrible and painful as that experience and so for me, part of me was secretly egging the killers on. Indeed at the end i wanted him to kneecap the jock bully, blow his kneecaps off and his ears off and then leave him alive. And that is part of the theme, the two quiet victims operating in the lowest caste of high school completely reverse their situation, all the powerless they endured, the fear and humiliation they return with interest. Their anger is obtuse and indiscriminate, their need to achieve a sense of self-empowerment  so great that all others must be brought down, their isolation from their peers so profound that they cannot tell who deserves it and who doesnt.

The film makes interesting characterisations, we have the nice guys ie the photography fans and we have another member of the low highschool caste - the self conscious girl with the curly black hair. The girl portrays the idea of a truly innocent victim, she is farthest from those who have bullied the killers, in killing her without thinking about it they erase any sympathy we have for their motives. The insecurity of the anxious curly haired girl is ironically matched by the three popular girls who's bulimia provides a striking match for the body-insecurity of the curly haired girl who refuses to wear shorts at PE. I agree with some peoples observations that the film is quite boring in places, i feel this works on an artistic level to some degree as drama is not reality and the film's goal is to portray the reality of school life.

I was totally disappointed and disgusted, especially since this film could have had so much real meaning.  Some criticism of American society and culture was absolutely required in order to do credit to the subject of mass killings in American schools.  But my conclusion after seeing this film was that it was made solely in order to criticize American society.  The tragedy of children dying was just convenient for exploitation.  The screenplay was promising in its approach but it was LOADED down with anti-American bias.  I don't appreciate paying to watch something only to realize it is actually propaganda masquerading as ""art.""  The childish attempts at symbolism with the key killer wearing an Arc de Triomphe T-shirt, playing classical piano pieces reasonably well, then switching to a violent video game, indulging in a last-minute homosexual first kiss and then blowing his classmates and teachers away with absolutely no emotion was all done in a few minutes.  It felt like this film was made for a French audience, particularly an ""artistic"" French film audience at Cannes.  How could they not award this bit of kowtowing to their favorite shallow symbolisms: American violence, the corruption of youth by American industry (software, videogames, etc), specifically a ""cultured"" youth who would have been fine if he had lived near the Arc de Triomphe he admired instead of where he could order guns from the website GUNS USA, and some token homosexual impulses (a 5-second bit added almost as an afterthought).  It had an alcoholic American father, the only parent we actually see in full form and who talks.  The film opens with him sideswiping cars in his perfect American suburban neighborhood and no one noticing.  I knew right then that these film makers had NO CLUE about real American life in a suburb or small town.  The entire rest of the film only confirmed this for me.  I actually used to check out Cannes awardees as an alternative to the usual Hollywood garbage.  Well, I should have known better; this was Hollywood garbage that won at Cannes.

The shooting scene was not disturbing at all to watch - because there was nothing to watch - it was boys shooting at things unseen.  Everything in this movie was plain, drab and sterile.

Van Zant tries to take you on a voyeuristic journey through a serene half day in the life of students only to try to shock you by the violence that ensues.  Really he just takes you through a pointless, character less, lifeless movie filled with nothing more then good cinematography.  The quintessential moment that best summarizes the movie is when a nameless, undeveloped character, hears shots and walks through a maze of abandon halls..Van Zant devotes a good five minutes to that walk only to end the walk in a pointless and meaningless manner.  Had he contrasted the walk through the abandoned halls with a bevy of earlier activity it would have given the walk more contrast and depth.  This movie was supposed to show what high school life is really like but what little character personality or development that can be found is cliche and the high school itself is a sterile empty mass that doesn't provide the movie nor the characters any depth.  Movies are considered short with running times of 80 minutes but this was the longest most pointless 80 minutes I have ever sat through.",1106265600,5,1290,4.631578947368421
1994244,5,B0001EFUFK,"I'm not expert on film, nor do I favor trendy ""minimalistic"" type movies.  I find them boring when used in an overtly artistic way, and as a rule of thumb they misfire.  I don't even like Gus Van Sant's work that much.  ""Good Will Hunting"" was corny and overrated; he stained the integrity of Alfred Hitchcock and the horror genre with his grotesque and embarrassing re-make of ""Psycho"". So I have no biases one way or the other when I say that this is a great movie.

""Elephant"" is not obvious either in content or pace, and is an extremely subtle exercise in the mysterious reality of the most awful things.  It is obvious, however, that Van Sant spent a lot of time researching the Columbine High School Massacre, although I wouldn't box this in with ""movies about Columbine"".  It has a reality all it's own, although this reality does extend to what happened in Littleton in a major way.

The film opens on a note of quiet dysfunction, with a drunken Timothy Bottoms attempting to drive his blonde haired son, John, to school.  When he shows up late with an excuse, the principal detains him and gives him detention. This nonchalant kid does a good job of simply being a nonchalant kid, and there isn't much ""acting""; the camera follows him in a serene way through the halls of his school, the people, places and things he sees on a day to day basis.  With what I think was Van Sant's purpose, this is perfect, but in the way of showing the reality of high school he is a little TOO underdramatic, whereas most hollywood garbage makes everything more glamorous and segregated than it really is.  That said, I prefer Van Sant's perceptual error.

John is different from the other characters we are introduced, though.  Eric and Alex, the two boys who go on a twenty minute massacre, choose for some reason that is not explained to spare him.  This parallels almost exactly what the shooters at Columbine high school did with one of their friends, although John is never shown socializing with them or even noticing them in passing.  They simply say: ""Get the f**k out of here and don't come back.  Some heavy sh*t's going down.""  We hear Eric (who appears to be the mastermind of the operation) say this three times, and the tone in his voice is not homicidal, despairing or suicidal, merely matter of fact and slightly urgent.  Van Sant strips away the drama we read into horrific incidents like Columbine to reveal the even uglier reality of what actually is: utter senselessness.

In this scene John is always saying hello to a dog named Boomer right before the pair walk up, clad in fatigues and carrying bags.  We see them approach in the distance as John is simply lost in his own orbit, living his life.  It is as if Van Sant is trying to strip away all our pretenses, our collective urge toward dichotomies like good and evil, the pastiche drama veiled over these incidents: evil approaches as innocuously and numbly as anything else, sometimes two goofy kids in combat gear.  We will not, no matter how hard we try, always be able to see it coming.

The absurd explanations for school massacres are parodied as Eric plays piano beautifully while Alex enjoys a violent video game. It is almost bleakly amusing to see all our grand explanations for demented incidents--video games, movies, etc--discarded in this manner. At one point they watch something on the Third Reich, but they might as well be watching an infomercial. One can enjoy the ""highest"" delights of our culture and still be a budding killer. They are so forgotten and unnoticed, so despairingly alienated, that they themselves don't know.  This is the point.

He has captured a piece of harsh reality here.  The last twenty minutes are as hard to watch and heart wrenching a piece of film as I've seen.  It is so real that it is difficult to watch.  These two boys, so lost they don't even seem to know they are, decide to destroy their own lives and take others with them, and do so as casually as choosing between salt and pepper before dinner. I imagine April 20 was actually a lot like this.  He takes away the cameras and the fiction added to it and shows us what it was like before and what it was like while it was happening.

I CANNOT for the life of me understand how they can see greatness in it.

The acting is terrible. Every line is delivered in a monotone.
The pacing is awful. It's a lot like watching paint dry.
And the script (was there a script?) was a notch or two below After-School Special level.

The kids look like something out of a ""trying waaay too hard to be hip"" ad.

I swear, I wanted to ring that blonde boy's neck after the forty-seven thousandth flip of his OBVIOUSLY professionally styled skater hair (oxymoron anyone?).

It's trying to make some point about the Columbine shootings but it's clear, this director knows NOTHING about real high school students.

And really what's the point of flashing a student's name up on screen if #1 You learn absolutely NOTHING of importance about them and #2 They ALL act like B-level stereotypes?

I'd wager the folks who've given this a good review are those pretentious folks who wanna look smarter than they actually are...Very much like this film. :-)

This film is just BAD on every level, except that it looks pretty.

Avoid it like the plague.",1105920000,4,2063,4.936231884057971
1994248,4,B0001EFUFK,"The atrocity that unfolded at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado on April 20, 1999 stuns the mind. Even now, more than five years after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold donned their black trench coats and went on a killing spree, we don't fully understand what motivated the pair to embark on a nightmare. The media, always quick to swoop down on a tragedy in order to throw blame around (and score some high ratings in the process), pointed their fingers at a host of social and psychological factors. Violent videogames, absentee parents, National Socialism, death metal music, bullying--all of these reasons, and a few more, issued forth from the mouths' of the ""experts"" consulted in the wake of the tragedy. Then the conspiracy nuts weighed in, those misguided, endearing souls who throw up web pages explaining the ""real"" story behind any national calamity. According to these crackpots, it's an absolute fact that Harris and Klebold had several as yet unknown accomplices helping them place the homemade bombs around the school. If you look hard enough, you might even see a few sinister references to an alien (as in extraterrestrial) influence in the disaster. Amazing, isn't it? Perhaps we will never understand why Columbine occurred.

Nevertheless, several films offer opinions on the tragedy. Gus Van Sant, a successful filmmaker with movies such as ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and ""My Own Private Idaho"" under his belt, submits ""Elephant"" for our perusal. Why choose ""Elephant"" for the title? Considering the structure of the movie, I imagine it has something to do with the ancient story concerning a group of blind men asked to describe an elephant. Each man touches a different part of the animal and ""sees"" it according to that specific body part. Only by taking all of their perceptions together do the men arrive at an accurate, or more accurate, description of the elephant. Van Sant does the same thing with his Columbine reenactment by looking at the events leading up the shooting from different students' perspectives. As the film begins, we meet blond headed John McFarland (John Robinson) driving to school with his father (Timothy Bottoms). Dad's been hitting the bottle again, so we see the car weaving through the streets and sideswiping parked vehicles. John and his father discuss firearms and hunting, and when the boy arrives at school he calls for someone to come down and drive dad home. As unpleasant as John's morning seems to be, his intoxicated father keeps John out of the classroom and eventually outside of the building when Eric (Eric Deulen) and Alex (Alex Frost) arrive.

Eric and Alex are the two preparing to massacre their fellow students. They tell John to stay away because ""something big is going to happen,"" or words to that effect. Indeed. Instead of taking us straight to the killings, Van Sant shifts focus and shows us the day as it unfolds through the eyes of other students. We follow student photographer Elias (Elias McConnell) as he walks to school, takes pictures of fellow students, and visits the photography lab. He even briefly stops to take a picture of John in the hallway as that student heads back outside to check on his father. Then he goes to the library. Meanwhile, Michelle (Kristen Hicks) survives another day of gym class--her instructor hassles her for not wearing shorts despite previous warnings--and eventually makes her way over to the library where she has a job shelving books. Jordan (Jordan Taylor), Brittany (Brittany Mountain), and Nicole (Nicole George) stand around in the hallway gossiping and ogling a guy who walks by with his girlfriend before heading over to the cafeteria for lunch. They happen to observe John outside talking to Eric and Alex but don't think anything of it as they depart for the bathroom for a quick purge (!) and more gossip. Van Sant fills the screen with other images--a GLAAD meeting at school, a black athlete named Bennie, and intimate scenes of the killers at home preparing for their destiny.

""Elephant"" seems to generate both good and bad reactions. Critics berate Van Sant for constructing a film that doesn't do anything, that doesn't stake out a position concerning why two kids would want to harm their fellow classmates. They hate the meandering pace of the film, too. In some respects, these detractors make an important point: we don't find any absolute answers in ""Elephant"" explaining why the killings happen, although Van Sant throws out a whole bunch of possible motivations ranging from easy access to firearms to videogames to National Socialism. Let's face facts, though: this film was never going to solve the permanent enigma surrounding Columbine. We might come closer to the truth by looking at the events through several sets of eyes--more hands on the elephant if you will--but the problem is that we don't know what this particular animal looks like in the first place. We are all blind men grasping for answers in the case of Columbine. Personally, I liked the film. The sense of palpable dread I felt watching Alex and Eric drive to school on doomsday is one I have never felt with any other film. The massacre is horrific, not because it's gory but because it looks and feels mundane and matter of fact.

I thought ""Elephant"" was a good film, as good a film could be when dealing with such horrific subject matter. It's certainly a better effort than the awful ""Duck: The Carbine High Massacre."" I went into Van Sant's film after hearing all about it, so I knew about the plot and the multi-layered narrative ahead of time. I think the film would work much better for a viewer who went in not knowing anything about the tragedy about to unfold. ""Elephant"" is a haunting, waking nightmare that makes you think long after the conclusion.",1105660800,4,5783,4.9282051282051285
1994249,2,B0001EFUFK,"I am not, for a second, going to question why Gus Van Sant made this film.  It was only a matter of time before an artist--be it film maker, author, playwrite, etc--did a piece depicting Columbine or some similar shooting at a school, and rightly so, I say.  It was a tragedy that shook the entire nation, not just here in the Littleton and Denver areas.  I was not a Columbine student, so I will not comment as a victim of sorts.  I live, work, and am often near the Columbine/Bear Creek/Ken Caryl area in Littleton, and I have known some survivors, but that is as close as I have been to this tragedy.  My views are not to be confused with those of someone who was actually there.

Gus Van Sant, the film's writer and director, takes us inside an un-named high school in what can only be considered middle-class-middle America.  It begins slowly, taking us through the opening day of many of the school's students; from the popular to the picked-on to the average, the men, the women, the students, the faculty and even a parent.  As the day progresses, it becomes apparent to the viewer, despite the cut-up style of scene editing and clipping, that a shooting similar to what happened at Columbine High School in 1999 is about to occur.

That's the film in a nut-shell.  My problems are not with subject matter, however.  As I said, it was only a matter of time before someone tackled the subject head-on, and I have to say it is better than a more down-to-earth director not as interested in profit like Gus Van Sant made this, and not some Hollywood name who was hired on.  No, my problems are about the existing film itself.

First off, the carnage in the school.  No, I'm not saying it is in any way necessary for any of it to be edited or dummed down so as not to offend people IF--and this is a biggie--IF it adds something to the film, either in statement or in effect.  Now, the scenes certainly are unsettling--they actually left me shaking.  So in that respect, mission accomplished.  But I have to ask why it happened the way it did?  At Columbine, many were wounded and a total of 13 people killed, including the gunmen.  In this story, it seems the gunmen (or boys, as it were) were succesful in taking out almost every single target.  These were/are two amateurs who had never shot anyone in real life, yet were dead-on (no pun intended) in every shot they fired.  I think part of the reason so many people DIDN'T die at Columbine and similar school shootings were because the gunboys really had no clue what they were doing.  If realism was what Gus was after, a lower body count would have done it.

Also, why were some characters introduced at all?  Benny jumps to mind, as he was shown for only one scene, had no dialogue, and was almost immediately killed.  And while on the subject of characters, what happened to the photographer for instance?  Why was the father drunk so early in the morning?  Why, before the shooting, did the two gunboys make out in the shower?  Did any of that really add anything to the conflict (if there really was any) to the story?  Not at all, really.  Without finding out why certain things are done, we're just watching half a story.  A violent ending just isn't enough for me to be interested.

Thirdly, and this is the big question, why did it happen?  I've seen plenty of news reports, heard eye-witness accounts, read articles, heard discussions, and on and on and on it goes, and the only thing this film did that all that didn't was show blood.  Once again, I'm not opposed to the showing of said violence, but if it is going to show up on film, I want to know why!  And just showing a kid getting spit-balls thrown at him by some A-hole jocks ain't enough to justify a rampage like this, either in real life or in the movies.  Plenty of kids are picked on in High School every day all across the nation, and probably all across the world.  Hell, I was one of them who was picked on!  So no one can say to me that being picked on is a reason why two kids decide to kill everyone in their sites--at most all I ever wanted to do was throw a punch at one or two people.  So again, the question is why?  If this subject is going to be explored, don't just throw in some gore and dead kids and expect the world to think a statement is being made.  To me, this movie had no purpose but to shock and appal.  It does nothing to try and explain, fix, or shed light on the problems at hand, nor does it really explore the minds of these two goons, or the real life weak-little boys they're modeled after.

And finally, closure.  So, we can guess the jock and his girl got it in the freezer.  But what then?  How did this effect the community, or more importantly the individual students?  Like I said, I've spoken to and heard survivors talk about what happened, but not everyone in the country has.  So why make this movie if in the end we're left asking the same question?  WHY?! Why did these two kids kill all those innocent people, and why did Gus Van Sant make such a stupid movie!",1105315200,3,5037,4.347266881028939
1994250,5,B0001EFUFK,"What a marvellous movie. It lets you yourself decide if and how you want to judge others. Because you probably read a review in the press you know what's going to happen in the end. But that's not what this is all about. The film shows us very tenderly what the newsmedia and the press so rarely care about. The ones involved. The everyday lives of all those that got hurt and those that got away. Just like that. Without the sensation. And, as I said before, without the slightest hint of judgement. Terrific!",1105228800,9,510,4.4361702127659575
1994251,1,B0001EFUFK,"Not sure why this movie won the Palme d'Or at Cannes...although it is the French who gave the award, so that explains alot.

Anyway, what you have here is 80 of the most boring, pointless minutes you will spend in your life. You will wish you could have these minutes back, but alas, will eject this DVD from your player and just stare at it mournfully.

As another reviewer stated, this film is a series of shots showing kids walking school hallways, walking to school, driving to school, talking about nothing in particular, almost like an unedited version of The Real World. It is supposed to depict the events leading up to a Columbine-style shooting, but it is so monotonous watching and listening to these moronic kids, I was rooting for the killers to waste even more of them by the time the carnage begins. I was disappointed the annoying blond haired kid escaped the killers' wraith (Oops! Spoiler!).

Gus Van Sant, who is hit or miss (remember his appaling remake of ""Psycho?), is in an apparently existential mood with this film, but it is so artsy and self-indulgent, it is not entertaining nor thought provoking, but instead soporific.

Finally, can someone please explain the title of the movie to me?  Is it a metaphor for ""the elephant in the room"" that no one wants to address, or is it the fat kid who gets whacked?",1105142400,5,1333,4.63135593220339
1994252,4,B0001EFUFK,"I believe that ""Elephant"" might be one of my favorite Indi films of this century. Gus Van Sant is a beautiful person with strong feelings on different subjects. The movie shows the relationship of music and actions. It also shows the typical high school, different social classes; the bully, the geeks, the jock, the kid with the alcohalic father, and the misunderstanded students. He showed how different actions can cause a chain reaction that can change lives. The best things about the movie was the perspectives and the music. I enjoyed how the story jumped from person to person, telling their story. The soundtrack was more Beehtoven and classical. I think the movie is represented well.",1103760000,,694,4.991379310344827
1994253,2,B0001EFUFK,"While watching this, I found myself thinking, ""Wow!  This is one of those rare moments when I am really grateful for the 'fast-forward' button!""  Seriously, the movie itself was good, but you'll find that more than half of the movie is just watching the back of some kids' back.  Literally.  The camera follows one student around for what seems like an eternity, then when that finally ends, it just goes on to some other kid to follow, or the camera remains motionless while a bunch of people pass in front of the camera.

One scene that really just gets me is when the camera is situated in the far back corner of a gym, and for what seems like hours, you watch a girl cross the gym floor.  Nothing else happens, she just takes her time crossing the gym floor...

Does that really create atmosphere?  Maybe.  Sort of.  Kind of.  Not really necessary, though.  And, like I said, I used the fast-forward button a lot.  Not so much because the film itself is boring, but because those many scenes where you are literally just watching a kid walk can get kind of tedious--and you do not need to watch a kid walk all that time, you will understand just as much about the kid walking fast-forwarding as you will watching it at its' normal speed.

Near the end, the movie really kicks up.  I couldn't leave my chair, it was just so interesting.  There was this one guy, though, near the end, that they introduce...I never really understood why he was introduced because he is only in for a short amount of time and literally adds nothing to the film.

This film just does some strange things like that, that don't always make sense.  It does sort of add atmosphere, though.

Overall, I would give this movie three stars for story and atmosphere...but just a few minutes into this movie, the same old camera techniques are used over and over again, that it just gets tedious, and you will be thankful for the little ""fast-forward"" button on your remote control...which is why I decided to give it two stars.

1994254,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant is an exceptional film despite the cool conceptual quality of the whole enterprise. Even though some dialogue was improvised, the film definitely feels in control.

We experience the boredom and routine nature of everyday life in a Colorado high school which is pulled into total chaos in the final 20 minutes of the film when two students begin killing fellow students and teachers.

The routine in this film builds suspense. We see and learn enough about the two killers to build tension. Yet, the climax is strangely silent as students run around the halls trying to duck for cover or escape the building. I did feel that Van Sant was able to capture the ""outsider"" aspects of the two young killers. One is taunted by a larger more handsome athletic student, a scene that everyone who has attended high school knows. When the two young men take a shower together and kiss I was left with the uncertainty as to whether they were gay, or teenage boys sexually experimenting, or sealing a bond, or experiencing intimacy with another person on the fringe of a larger society.

The young killers are outsiders, on the margin of the group, and alienated. Yes, the scenes and kids were ordinary. Yes, the teasing and ostracizing is typical of all high schools. There are kids on the fringe of every community. Van Sant just reminds us of the costs.

I would recommend this film be shown in public high schools followed by discussion. I realize this concept would freak out 95% of the parents in the USA, but ostracism and alienation represses the outsiders and it also represses the insiders and bright teenagers can learn this lesson.",1103241600,2,1640,4.784452296819788
1994255,5,B0001EFUFK,"Well for those reviewers who are criticizing the film as too showy or artsy or boring to watch, I'm not sure they were viewing the same film I was.  It was captivating to me, and thoroughly engrossing from the start to the finish.  It was certainly unlike any film I had ever seen - no music cues for most of the movie, long tracking shots, and character interaction shown mostly from a detached and distant position.  And for me, that entire way of shooting the film built up my suspense and abject fear at what was about to happen.  It wasn't boring at all.  It completely enthralled me.  And when the blonde kid is told not to go back into the school as the killers were entering, my heart was racing.  The end scenes were brutal in their violence and terribly painful to watch, and there was no cathartic release.  But it was brilliant.

Do I know what message van Sant was trying to send with this movie?  No.  Do I know why these kids committed their murders? No.  Was that his point?  I have no idea.  But I don't need to know.  I loved the movie while watching it, watched it again to see if I could learn more, and enjoyed it again.  And I've thought about all the implications of the movie and what it may or may not have been saying for months afterwards.  That's something that few if any movies make me do.  Was it challenging? Certainly.  Was it enjoyable? Very much so.  Was it boring? Not in the least.  Highly recommended.",1103068800,3,1439,4.334586466165414

It is not ""riveting"" or emotionally captivating or innovative, informative, or thought provoking in any way.

1994257,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant moves at an appropriate pace: slow, steady, and calm. But wait, isn't this movie supposed to be about a high school shooting? Shouldn't there be drama and emotion and gore? Elephant does the seemingly unexpected in its depiction of the Columbine shooting; it provides little or no character development, no sense of justice that the audience is begging for as soon as the first shot is fired. Instead, the movie has abrupt inserts, extraneous footage, repeated scenes, and an overall sense of disconnection. It is uncomfortable, detached, and in the end, abandoning. And that's exactly how Elephant should be.

The achievement of this film lies in its appropriateness, its understanding of the subject matter. It quietly excuses itself from all the Hollywood clichs and expectations and consciously leaves its audience without closure, without an explanation for the events that take place. At first this inconsiderate abandonment is frustrating, as it ought to be, but considering that the actual Columbine shooting was left unresolved, with no criminals to pursue or punish, creating a hero or triumphant end - or even a slight inkling of remorse from the killers - would be an undeserved privilege.

Yet another Hollywood aspect left out of Elephant is violent and dramatic action. The camera rarely concentrates on the victims; the actors fall dead as soon as they are shot, without wailing in pain or gushing out blood; the one explosion in the movie isn't much more than a boom and a cloud of smoke. Rather than glorify the violence of the massacre, the director chooses to portray it almost matter-of-factly. As bewildering as it is to think about a shooting spree on the same level as grocery shopping, it's really the most appropriate method to represent the way the shooters interpret their actions.

These kids don't feel much. The audience barely even sees the hatred that could have inspired them to kill their fellow students; what is apparent though is the video game-like way in which they approached their massacre. Point and shoot, point and shoot; 100 bonus points for the principal. The virtual reality of their actions further enhances the sense of disconnection and illusion that characterizes the entire movie.

Elephant offers no answers to the events it portrays; the last word one might use to describe this film is ""satisfying."" Elephant chooses not to discriminate between its audience and the people actually involved in the shooting. It is not a search for causes or sources, for a single reason why two teenage boys would go to their high school one day and start killing people; such a quest would be unachievable. What Elephant does achieve is a tone equal to that of the real event; what's troubling is that the tone itself is unreal.",1102550400,5,2777,5.017353579175705
1994258,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant  took a much different tone from Gerry, the Van Sant film that preceded it earlier in the year, and encompasses a much more complete and pointed theme. The film explores a typical day in a Colorado high school, which is brought to a screeching halt because of Columbine-like violence. It proves to be a tiger of film, as I couldn't stop thinking about it and how powerful it was for weeks after my viewing.

Again, working from a nonexistent script and improvisational dialogue, this time Van Sant employed real high school students who used their real first names. I haven't been out of high school long, and this film struck me with its honesty and accuracy in portraying an ""every day"" lifestyle of the high schoolers of America. Many people criticized Elephant, calling it irresponsible to portray a subject of such importance and not tie any of the loose ends or give reasons for the tragedy. However, it is completely true that Elephant's responsibility comes from this refusal to explain Columbine and other instances like it. Van Sant has no more answers than the rest of us, and he wouldn't dare pretend to.

The title was in reference to an old proverb Van Sant remembered hearing in which a group of blind men all try to describe an elephant, but come up with completely different answers because they were examining only a piece of the whole. Other's have equated it with the idea of the elephant in a room, clearly there, but completely missed for whatever reason. The complex and impressive narrative style is perfectly reflective of Sant's explanation of the title, with it's long tracking shots and tendency to follow one character for long periods of time giving the impression that other aspects of the story are being missed. Some of the day's actions are overlapped from multiple perspectives giving new meaning to the event each time (a technique also utilized in Satantango, a film by Hungarian director Bela Tarr). Yet once the film is done, the viewer knows that it wouldn't matter how much of the story they got, it would still be an ultimate mystery. Never in real life has a story been constructed with all of the facts in place. Elephant recognizes this, thus making it an incredibly mature coverage of a highly sensationalized topic and most definitely my favorite film of 2003.

Whether you loved or hated them, Elephant and Gerry  are two films that are hard to ignore. Few films coming out of recent American cinema have been this unique, and few directors working today are as talented as Van Sant.",1101945600,8,2540,4.789954337899544

The movie is quiet, with just a little bit of Beethoven, which lends an interesting tone to certain scenes, detached and a little sad. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue, even in the scenes with conversation. The gunshots aren't glorious and exploding like in most Hollywood features, they're quiet too. The silence brings power to the movie, putting you in a state of anticipation, wondering what will sound next.

You went to high school, right? If not, you're going to. It's not a beautiful thing, unfortunately for Van Sant. The characters are forced to have problems, so that people see that high school isn't another Mandy Moore movie. But for some people, Van Sant is a visionary with the genius to not have to explain his characters. Why? If you're smart, you should 'get' it. Elephant is an exploration into arrogance. There is nothing to get. Getting 'it' is simply feeding your own ego. It is long-winded and boring until the final scenes, and you already saw those coming. It draws its emotional reaction from the vast pool of despair that surrounds even the mention of Columbine.

I love movies, and not just ones with the Rock. But Van Sant took too many liberties making this movie into an art piece rather than a movie. Obviously a lot of people enjoy this movie. But know what you're getting yourself into. If you go to movies to enjoy them and learn a little about yourself and the world around you, stay away.

1994262,1,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant was once the toast of independent film, with the success of the quirky ""My Own Private Idaho"" and the searing ""Drugstore Cowboy.""  After a foray into the mainstream (""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Finding Forrester""), he returned to indie film-making in 2002, releasing two largely improvised films back-to-back: ""Gerry"" and ""Elephant.""  I was not a fan of the former, and I disliked ""Elephant"" even more.

""Elephant"" attempts to show, with documentary-like realism, the types of indignities and torture that kids face everyday.  Unfortunately, the movie's brief running time and style prevents us from really getting to know these kids.  Little is shown about the characters' lives or internal processes - I felt no emotional investment in any of them.  As a result, the film has a somewhat voyeuristic tone; we're seeing people we don't know in uncomfortable situations.  Furthermore, prior films have offered much greater insight into bullying, notably ""Welcome to the Dollhouse.""  As a treatise on American youth, the film offers little that is new.

Of course, it could be argued that Van Sant intended the film to be inscrutable and lacking in easy responses - indeed there are certainly no easy answers for bullying and violence.  Unfortunately, the film is simply not compelling enough on its own merits to succeed on that level.  Ultimately, ""Elephant"" ends up being just another violent film with characters that lack depth.  What a pity.

1994263,5,B0001EFUFK,"I watched this film in my art of cinema class, and I was very dissapointed that no one, even the proffesor, understood the filmmakers intent. In my opinion it wasn't very hard to see. Gus Van Sant was trying to show the different persectives between ""normal"" people and mentally unstable people in a situation like this. He used a lot of tracking shots, following the students walk through the halls. Many of the reviews said they thought that was annoying, but that is were the message is. The tracking shots are uneventful. To the ""normal"" students this is a regular day. What you should notice is that there are very few tracking shots with the killers, and the few we see are of them planning the masacre, and shooting the students. In their tracking shots there is something happening, it's never an ordinary, uneventful day for them. This is the distiction you should be looking for. These shots also serve to show that in this situation, no matter what ""group"" your peers classify you as, your perspectives are the same.

The reason they did what they did was also very clear to me. In one scene two jocks are throwing paper, and I believe spit balls as well, at one of the killers. Immediately after that his tracking shot shows him walking through the cafeteria, planning the incident. Then when the blonde haired killer is talking to the principal, cowering on the floor, he says something to the effect of, 'now you'll think twice about messing with people like us.' How is this not clear?

One comment I heard in class was that this film glorifies the killers and promotes sensless violence. I think this film does the opposite. If he would have used the usual conventions of American filmmaking it would have glorified the killers by using sappy score, predictable dialogue,A list actors, and expensive, mindless special effects. This movie is not meant to promote sensless violence, but to rationalize the string of school shootings that happened a few years ago. If you think this film promotes violence, you are not looking for the message, because you are too preoccupied with finding ways to make a visionary's work evil and menacing, because it depicts the reality of our society that you do not want to reflect upon.

there are some brilliantly and beautifully written reviews of

Here's a little test. When it comes time to buy a greeting card,
would you buy one with a pre-existing sentiment printed inside,
or would you select a blank card? If you are one of those who
prefers someone else to express something on your behalf,
then chances are you won't care for Elephant. Most American
made movies spell everything out and wrap everything up.

But life - and art - and cinema ( good cinema ) aren't like that.

There is a scene in "" American Beauty ""...a couple of kids
were watching a video of a piece of paper swirling around. It was
one of the signature scenes in the movie, and lots of people loved it.
While the paper swirled, the kid who had filmed the paper explained
to his friend why the swirling paper was meaningful - and thereby
explained to me why the swirling paper was meaningful.  I lowered
my head.

I live quite near Columbine High School, and the hobgoblins of
that day are never very far off, so I wasn't altogther avid about

"" Artistry can redeem any subject matter. "" But again, if your
idea of artistry is Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill - and not Lost in

be told. While one of the psychopaths is at the piano, the camera
circles his room. There is a small drawing of an elephant
tacked to the wall...but what of it? The title is as enigmatic as
much of what happens in the movie, and in its oblique way,
fits the film perfectly. Just as "" Five Easy Pieces "" fits that film

1994267,5,B0001EFUFK,"""Elephant"" is Gus Van Sant's brilliant and mind-blowing distillation of teenage alienation and angst.  Set on one of those sterile suburban high school campuses, the film recounts a typical day in the life of a school - typical that is until it ends in a Columbine-type massacre.

Here is a film in which style does indeed become substance, where the ""meaning"" lies in the form and shape of the film itself.  Rather than tell us a conventional ""story,"" Van Sant has chosen to give his film the look and feel of a pseudo-documentary, merely recording the events and conversations that occur that day, a day we are led to believe is not unlike every other at that school.  Van Sant's prying camera eye turns us into voyeurs, as we observe the cliquishness, petty humiliations, and sheer overwhelming banality that have defined high school life for so many of us.  Van Sant uses space brilliantly.  Despite the fact that this is undoubtedly a school with a large student population, the characters on whom he focuses seem always to be somehow isolated from almost everyone else around them.  None of the characters we see really seem to have any connection with one another, and even when they do, it tends to be of only the most superficial kind.  They are like people stranded on their own individual islands, enduring their suffering alone and in silence.  Van Sant sets the tone with his tracking shots of characters strolling down seemingly endless corridors heading to nowhere in particular, making little or no human contact as they go.  The camera, throughout the film, seems to have a mind of its own, often avoiding what seems to be a major plot point and, instead, zeroing in on something that seems to have little or no real importance.  Then through the process of editing, he weaves nothing less than a tapestry of alienation.  By concentrating so intently on the seemingly irrelevant minutia of daily life, Van Sant brings to the film a sense of documentary immediacy most fiction films lack.  We are made privy to bits and pieces of conversation only to have the talk dribble off as we or the characters turn the corner and move on to the next group of people.  It is the deadening ""sameness,"" the insignificance of so much of what we see and hear that makes this such a sad and haunting experience.

One thing Van Sant refuses to do is try to ""explain"" why the killers act as they do.  He's smart enough to know that there is no single explanation for such behavior, that it arises from a variety of sources and that it is primarily the product of a general feeling of alienation in modern society.  We see one of the murderers suffering humiliation at the hands of two schoolmates, the second killer playing a violent video game and perusing a gun magazine, but these, in and of themselves, cannot be the sole explanations.  At best they are symptoms of a much deeper societal sickness, one that Van Sant can only hint at but never fully grasp - for who among us can claim to truly understand it?  What ""Elephant"" does is to make us focus on and actually see this spirit-crushing ennui which permeates our culture and which defines life for so many of our youngsters.

The director has drawn fine work from his cast of talented unknowns.  Their every word, their every gesture rings believable and true.  He has also employed Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"" to serve as a haunting refrain throughout the film, capturing the poignancy of a world in which beauty, spontaneity and joy seem to have been removed.

There are some who will find ""Elephant"" to be slow-moving, empty, arty and pretentious.  For them there are plenty of mindlessly upbeat depictions of high school life to watch.  But for those who can appreciate a film artist working at the peak of his form, ""Elephant"" is a mesmerizing, vision-altering experience that pushes the boundaries of the medium and takes us to a place, emotionally, that we haven`t ever been before.",1099785600,21,3943,4.721167883211679

There was no character development, a lack of interesting dialogue and by the time you realize two kids were being portrayed as the Columbine killers, you almost wish for the shooting to begin to end the misery of watching this horrible film.

You don't kow much about the characters except that one has a drunken father, one is a photographer, two are in love and three girls have eating disorders. The walking and the piano playing gets old fast. I was just yearning for the shootings to start so I can have something to watch. But when they finally do start, it's very unemotional. You hear a few screams and that's it. You would think that the students would be more upset if someone was shooting up the school.

The film failed to convey the emotions that the world had towards the Columbine shootings, let alone the emotions of the parents, children and the local community must have had.

I got surprised that this film got the golden Palm for the cannes film festival. But the reason it got the award was because of the subject, not the cinematic acheivment. It fact the movie was shot for cable for HBO.

the movie shows the different lives of several students in school before the massacre. When we get a real life encounter with the characters, the director really gives it to us. This movie really tested my patience where there was hardly any editing. We see each individual student in their school life and where they go, the camera follows and we see countless minutes of them walking for one place in the school to the other.. that really made me annoyed. but it all pays off with a (non) explosive finale with the actual massacre.

We get an insight on the two murderers before the massacre.

WE see them watching Hitler Docu., killing spree video games, trying out their new guns. These explain their character. they were obviously violent...

THe massacre isn't sensationalized but it definently makes us shiver. we get to see people wandering around not nowing what is going on and living or dying for no fault of their own.

and ending with a chilly finale.

This movie can test your patience but overall it gives a deep insight of a normal school day ( well.. sort of...)

What I can say is that this film chilled me to the bone. When the Columbine tragedy occurred in 1999, my wife and I visited the high school shortly after the shootings.  There were countless memorials.  Flowers, pictures, drawings.  The cars of the victims were still in the parking lot. Elephant brought those memories back to me.

I now have two daughters of my own.  Watching a film like Elephant reminds you that life is fragile.  Immediately after watching it, all I wanted to do was be with my children.  I wanted them to be safe.  Perhaps that is the real purpose of a film like this.  Get involved with your children's lives.  Talk with them.  Be there for them.  Be the difference in their lives.

1994276,2,B0001EFUFK,"I suppose Gus Van Sant thought that this stripped down approach to the surreal events that take place in a fictitious school would shock people by showing just how ordinary these kids seemed, but the subtext (which is all you can read in this movie) belies this.  Van Sant makes numerous textual references with the underlying theme taken on a very odd homosexual tone.

He chooses to shoot most of these students from behind as they walk down corridors, have lunch at the cafeteria and come into brief contact with each other around this large high school.  He tries desperately to make it all seem so real, employing a group of high school kids to carry out the action in this film.

The sequence of events are broken up, as they were in Memento, dovetailed together by recurring scenes.  There isn't any attempt to make sense of the scenes, or provide much of a motivating force for the two kids' murderous rampage in the end. It simply is what it is, and you can draw your own conclusions from it.

The problem is that Van Sant utterly fails to allow the viewer to empathize with any of the persons in this film.  They are reduced to pixel images that kids shoot in video games.  The girls share a little bit of vacuuous gossip and the super jock tries to get his girlfriend to go four wheeling with him after school, but no real relationships are established, nor is there any sense that Van Sant wanted to.

1994279,5,B0001EFUFK,"I respect your right to not like this movie.

""Elephant"" is a response to the rash of Columbine-esque killings. As a result, I think people come to this movie expecting to find some kind of answers. It's natural. Normally, if you're going to make a film about a controversial, contemporary topic, you have some kind of ""message"" that you want to convey about it. ""Elephant"" doesn't really have a message, per se. It offers no explanation. It's just an observation. That can be very frustrating, although I found it fascinating.

""Elephant"" is a day-in-the-life look at several individuals in a high school, including the two students who end up killing their fellow students. Apparently, the actors in this film are actually not actors at all and a lot of what occurs on screen wasn't scripted. And, in fact, there's a very natural/authentic feeling to the movie. There's no story arc or conflict-resolution, and no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys."" Just a bunch of students doing their thing on a normal day. The only thing that makes it NOT normal is that the viewer is very much aware that something horrible is about to happen, which lends a very creepy feeling to all this very mundane day-to-day stuff.

Gus Van Sant includes some very interesting stuff in this movie without ever telling the viewer ""This is why these killings occur,"" or ""Here's the solution."" For example, at one point we follow three high school girls as they talk-talk-talk about this and that, eating lunch, wandering through the halls, finally entering the women's bathroom, each entering a private toilet stall, and then we hear them each making themselves vomit up their lunch. The whole thing is almost comical because it's done with so little ""drama."" It's obvious that this is a daily ritual, no big thing, and it barely interrupts their conversation. In a different movie, there would be some big dramatic music to set up this development, but in this movie it's just like, ""Yeah, so...?""

But the fact that this is even included in the movie makes the viewer wonder, ""Is the director suggesting that the same societal values that leads to self-induced vomiting are ALSO somehow responsible for the killings that occur?"" But, there's no answer to that question. This is just one of a hundred different things that happen in this movie. You're left to draw your own conclusions.

The thing that is so frustrating about this movie, I think, is that you keep wanting to be told whose fault it is. Should we blame the principal? Or the parents? Or society? Or... who? But there's no answer to that question.

And that's what makes this movie so damn brilliant. To provide us with an answer would be to wrap the whole issue up for us in a tidy little box and let us get on with our day, content that that particular mystery has been solved. But ""Elephant"" doesn't let us off the hook so easily. The question is never answered and there's no sense of resolution.

The problem with this movie is that Van Sant succeeded only in recreating a story loosely based on what is believed to happen the day of the Columbine shootings, and nothing more. The stereotypical signs of the potentiallly homicidal student are all there: our antagonists play violent video games, listen to angry music, have emotionally distant parents, experience social alienation, and even briefly experiment with homosexuality. This movie doesn't give us anything new, it only exploits what the media is already telling us is wrong with young generations of students in the United States. To top things off, Van Sant selected the first movement of Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata,"" and Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"" to be played ad nauseum throughout the movie. Any amateur pianist can tell you that those two pieces are by far the most overplayed piano pieces in the repertoire; don't kill us by making us listen to your fifteen year old hero/murderer bang it out on his upright, over..and over..and over again.

Ostensibly, the movie is about a high school in Portland, Ore., that's set upon by two gun-wielding teenagers. The camera wanders the campus and hallways, and follows oddly polite, possibly medicated students from room to room for more than an hour until, finally, terrible violence erupts.

Writer-director Gus Van Sant plays a lot of bizarre, unsettling tricks with sound and focus, and the movie is eerie and beautiful, an afterschool special crossed with ""The Shining.""

Still, does he have a point? He drops lots of possible explanations for the crimes (violent video games, easy access to guns and extra-strength teen angst) and underlines the futility of it all (many of the characters who die are even bigger outcasts than the shooters). But Van Sant doesn't really draw any real conclusions about the movie's Columbine-like situation, he just lets it play out, which will frustrate many viewers but enthrall others.

It makes you think about why they are the way they are. He didn't have to use much dialogue to convey this. I liked the  way he sequenced the scenes-all of it came together very well. I think this film is good if you're in the mood to zone out and be an observer. I disagree with the reviewer who said that if you are into Star Wars type films then you probably won't like this one. I know there are some people who probably only watch action films-but for the most part, people renting this film are obviously interested enough that they don't stick to one particular genre, or category.

1994288,5,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant demonstrates once again that he is a master filmmaker and artist of unique vision.  This perfect, understated little film is remarkable and striking on every level.

'Elephant' is an inspired rendering of the shootings at Columbine, despite its standard disclaimer against resemblance to people living or dead.  Mr. Van Sant developed a unique approach for this compelling issue and eschews normal cinematic artifices.  There is no soundtrack except ambient sounds of nature and the usual cacophony of a high school.  The only music we hear -- an amateurish rendering of Beethoven -- is played on an out-of-tune piano by one of the young killers.

The cinematography is stunning and the narrative architecture ingenious.  The story unfolds in a Faulknerian manner by identifying and following a number of high school students one at a time.  Long tracking shots, slow pans, and minimal dialogue imbue the film with a real-time flavor.  Use of extremely shallow focus renders the point-of-view of each student both intimate and personal.  They seem unrelated at first, but these individual narrative threads begin to interweave, becoming one fabric in the eerily low-key finale.  The movie builds inexorably to one end but, through its methodology, underscores the random perversity of tragedy, and paths crossing at the wrong place and time.

Throughout its 81 minutes, the film makes no moral judgments, offers little sentiment and, most important, comes to no gratuitous conclusions.  It is simply a hyper-realistic depiction of a day in the life of an ordinary high school which ends most extraordinarily.

There is only one professional actor in the film.  Timothy Bottoms, who had demons of his own as a teenager in 'The Last Picture Show' 40 years ago, plays an ineffectual father.  Mr. Van Sant recruited all the actors from the Portland high school where he filmed, and draws the most amazing natural performances from these startlingly beautiful young people. Using the simplest of elements, this distinguished artist has produced perhaps the greatest allegory of our time.",1092528000,3,2095,5.246246246246246
1994289,1,B0001EFUFK,"I just finished watching it, mostly in fast-motion since more than half of this tiny 80-minute beast is pointless walking.  I couldn't believe they showed the jock walk ALL the way from the Field to the front office...what was that, 5 minutes of nothing?

Another reviewer said ""These silent moments let you think during the movie"", but I'll tell you, any normal person watching a MOVIE could only be thinking ""when will this movie actually GO somewhere???"" .  Shallow characters, completely stereotypical (yet true, of course :) and what was with the ""hero"" black guy?  That was horrible.  I thought there might actually be a confrontation between the shooter and makeshift ""hero"" which would have been ALMOST worth watching, but of course not in this movie:

Introduce ""hero"" character, show hero walking for way too long, show someone else doing nothing, go back to hero walking, hero finds shooter and sneaks up on him, hero dies.  niiice....:/

On a final note, I couldn't tell whether this was supposed to have taken place before or after Columbine.  Everyone seemed just a tad bit too calm about the whole thing before AND after the shooting started.  During the scene of the Gay/straight supporter getting shot, the only acting involved is ""oh, he's been shot."" and ""quick, pull him in the room, does anyone know CPR?"" No one bothers to say anything like ""what the heck is going on??? Oh my gosh, someone's in the school shooting people!!""...nope, nothing of the sort. Yet right before he's shot, they hear gunfire and say ""It's just fireworks or something, don't worry about it.""  It has to be one or the other, calm before/pre-Columbine or calm during/Post-Columbine, there's no realistic way it can be both.",1092355200,9,1718,4.9100346020761245
1994290,1,B0001EFUFK,"I watched this movie because I actually wanted to like it. It seemed interesting, but after the first 10 minutes of the character walking and realizing that they showed all this walking to some anti-climactic activity the character does made me wonder if I might be wasting a lot of time watching this movie. I kept watching, thinking that there had to be more to this movie other than walking and boring activities. I'd rather develope film myself rather than watch a shot of someone developing there negatives for what seemed like 10 minutes of the movie. I was almost scared to get up and walk to the bathroom for thirty seconds for fear that something INTERESTING might happen. I remember high school being boring, but wow, I think that if it were that boring I might kill myself rather than take it out on everyone else. I hung out with all the depressed goth kids and even a group of melancholy kids weren't as uneventful and boring as that movie was. After seventy minutes of walking and then the kids finally shooting the school up I couldn't believe it ended with ""eeny, meeny, miney, moe"". For those unfortunate enough to endure this movie, you know what I mean. As for the three girls who have some unlikely conversation about whatever they were talking about, then puking in the bathroom, it's almost as if they wanted you to not feel bad when they get shot. When it finally happened it was more of a mercy killing. Anyway, my suggestion is not only save your money, but save your time. Go walk around campus with your dad's camcorder and film a day of school. Even that might actually have a plot, and be a little more interesting. Next, send it to the producer of this movie, you might have a chance of making it big!",1091491200,8,1731,4.515923566878981
1994291,2,B0001EFUFK,"There was some tension involved in watching Elephant because, knowing it is about a Columbine type of school shooting, I did not want to see any of these young people murdered in the inevitable finale. That said however, I found the movie too detached in its presentation and too coldly dispassionate about the events depicted to create any resonance.

  I can understand Van Sant's difficulty in trying to explain the inexplicable but his subsequent avoidance of any attempt to provide any background and context for these actions, his failure to shed any light on the matter means we have here simply an exercise depicting the surface of things only. Nothing is learned. What then is the purpose of this film?

  Beyond the lack of substance I did not care for the execution of the film either. The long tracking shots of students walking through the corridors and across the lawns of the High School, meant no doubt to convey the depersonalized atmosphere of what is a large facility and the consequent isolation and/or alienation of the students quickly became tedious and tiresome.

  Likewise, the lack of any dialogue of any consequence may be meant to create verisimilitude of reality and to depict either the inanity and insipidness of High School or, worse yet, the students themselves. But film is NOT reality.  Of course everyday life doesn't always have interesting or crackling dialogue but that is why we have the Art of Writing (to enhance and enrich our understanding, to convey meaning).

  Finally, while Van Sant does present the ordinariness of the killers and their cool murderous calculations, what on earth was the bit in the shower supposed to mean? A reflection of the class discussion shown about repressed homosexuality? I don't think so. I found that scene jarringly amiss.

  It might be of passing interest to some that an exhaustive study of the two Columbine killers has finally been completed. Despite the myth that has grown and become accepted that they were the victims of bullying, the study found otherwise. Bullying was no more or less a problem at Columbine than at the H.S. I went to years ago. The problem was simply that Eric Harris was a psychopath, who found a perfect partner to help him carry out his murderous fantasies. If he hadn't done this, he would have done something else just as deadly, perhaps serial killings. Whether intentional or not, Van Sant's piano-playing murderer catches some of that, and for that little bit of insight in an otherwise fairly dull and empty film, I will give him 2 stars.",1091145600,5,2556,4.881944444444445
1994292,5,B0001EFUFK,"...and sit down to watch this film. There are so many depths explored by Gus's simple camera-work that if you don't leave feeling moved, you'll leave feeling inspired to pick a camera of your own.

 Hopefully this won't make readers STOP reading this review, but I'll start off saying I am in high school. This movie is made to relate to my peer group before any other, especially since apparently these kids were probably born a few months before or after myself. Let me be the judge on realism, then, ok?

 There are several reasons this film is so compelling (and deserved to sweep the Cannes), but I'll address the most sound few. (This is the important part):

 ================================================================

 *1* The concept of the movie is brilliant as a whole. Gus takes a flawlessly realistic ... well, reality... thereby getting the audience to relate. Maybe some of the audience is bored, maybe some of the audience is riveted. (But you know what? Some people are bored with life itself, and some people love every minute. This is where most of the viewers will part ways - those who detest watching the world they already live in will be anxious for the bullets to start flying, and those who appreciate will be completely enveloped in the film from start to finish.)

 ANYWAY, back to the point - the brilliant concept. Gus takes this realistic reality so that initially we relate, and then adds in this gutwrenching tragedy so our brain sort of fumbles over itself. Unable to relate, the brain becomes horrified and compassionate. These two emotions are used in other films, I guess, but never have they been so intensely real as when I watched Van Sant's Elephant.

 (I shudder at how grief-stricken actual Columbine alumni or even just the citizens of Littleton become when the credits start to roll.)

 *2* The cinematography in this film is unique. That's inarguable. However, lots of people stop right there with the discussion. The cinematography isn't JUST unique, it is essential to the film. The obvious reasons are the suspense it piles on as well as the ability to watch the individual characters interacting (Some scenes are witnessed up to three times from separate perspectives. This is an idea I ABSOLUTELY love.)

 The less blatant reason is that these angles allow for plenty of rewatchability. The long, long, dialogueless scenes emulate reality so perfectly that, along with the visual aspect, they create mental reality too. You can THINK during these periods of time (if thinking is something you like doing); you can think as if you ARE the character onscreen. For example, I related very well with a few of the characters in different ways. I LOOK like John, I act like Elias, and I have mannerisms in speech and movement similar to Nathan's. (I type a lot more thoughtfully than I talk, mind you.)

 Again, this is where the audience will part ways. Some people don't like having to think during movies. This is normal, I suppose, as some folks go to the cinema solely for entertainment.

 ================================================================

 This review is getting lengthy but there is so much more in this movie than what these words on Amazon.com have to offer. After all, I'm only a teenager so what's my word worth? (If you actually just shrugged and thought I had a valid point there then I'll give you a second to apologize and realize I was kidding. Read on.)

 There is no reason this film does NOT deserve 5 stars. It won't win any Oscars, of course, because the actors are all brand-new (but never miss a beat, don't get me wrong) and the film itself is too experimental, but the Oscars HAVE been wrong before (coughTITANICcough).

 Even if you do not like it, it will stick with you in a positive way.

1994294,1,B0001EFUFK,"I am quite shocked by the favorable reviews I'm seeing for what is definately the worst movie Van Sant ever made, and just an all-around bad movie in general. There is no character development - I didn't care at all that these kids were going to be massacred. In fact, I kept looking at my watch waiting for the shooting to begin so the movie would be over. Everyone already knows the plot, but even without the mystery you would think there would be cool cinematography, good acting, interesting dialog...something. The movie has none of these things - don't waste your time. If you want shaky camera shots of teenagers walking around all day, rent Kids again.",1090972800,9,661,4.6581196581196584
1994295,4,B0001EFUFK,"This is a chilling story of what begins as a normal high school day. In this movie, obviously patterned after Columbine, the students who are shot by the militant extremist students are all shown in the hour before their death. You get to know them and then they are killed. This is much more powerful than any Michael Moore film could show. It is disturbing on many levels, but especially disturbing as it shows the two young sociopaths calmly planning their day of destruction. At one point, while loading their guns, one of the boys says, let's pick off as many students as we can...and ""don't forget to have fun.""

 It gives one a feeling of utter helplessness. While watching this film, you get a sense that there is nothing that can be done to stop what inevitably will happen. No one can stop the profound anger that has built up these angst-filled teens, hell bent on a road straight to hell. You also get the feeling early on that there is nothing in the impersonal atmosphere and sometimes cruel atmosphere that can give these troubled boys what they need.

 If there is any lesson this film teaches, it is that WE MUST TALK TO OUR CHILDREN BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!",1090886400,,1173,4.518867924528302
1994296,1,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant's latest insult to the viewing public is a classic indie con job. It's a film, obviously inspired by the Columbine High School shootings, in which people walk around an anonymous high school all day long, going through their daily routines for an excruciating 70 minutes of celluloid before two kids dressed in camouflage clothing come in and shoot the place up. It is anti-climactic, pointless, fervently anti-Hollywood, and incredibly boring.

 But it uses long tracking shots, is technically adept, ""offers no answers"" and ""makes us think,"" uses bleak classical piano pieces for a soundtrack, has an obtuse name (stemming from the ""elephant in the living room"" phrase, that, in retrospect, really has nothing to do with the film at all), and begins and ends with artsy shots of the sky. So it's brilliant. Automatically. Don't you dare dissent, because you're wrong, and an idiot.",1090368000,9,896,5.08843537414966
1994297,2,B0001EFUFK,"I'm amazed a film like this could sweep awards at Cannes, or any festival. The camera floats around an ordinary school, tracking students' lives, nothing special, your average day stuff, in what seemed like a thinly veiled take on the Columbine tragedy of school shootings.
There are no good guys and bad guys, every character is made sympathetic simply by being real, by being himself, by being human. This includes the two weirdos who go on a rampage, who played violent video games (like most teenagers) and  watched documentaries on Hitler with rapt attention. Not sure if this was an implied cause, or just a nonchalant and thus somehow artistic trope.
That's it. That's the plot. One of the ""spotlight reviews"" on this site mentions how the lack of a point was in fact the point. Well that's good for life but capturing life as-is on film, without any perspective or any cinematic accoutrement at all, is a bit pointless if not outright stupid.
""Elephant"" seems like a deliberately point-of-view-less film, much like its title, which has nothing to do with anything in the movie.
So if you, like the French, have a taste for a sequence of screens that do not necessarily need to hinge around a semblance of a theme or purpose, you'll be in entertainment heaven. Grab your six packs and discuss motives and perspective and all those lovely film theory things long into the sunset.

1994301,5,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant has created a wonderful and disturbing film, creatively using long tracking shots that move from character to character and double-back in time, until we gradually view this high school as a fabric of kids and teachers each going about in their isolated but intimately linked day.  It takes a little while to figure out who the shooters will be, and even then we don't get much insight into their motives, but from a dispassionate camera that's okay.  I found that, even knowing what was coming up, the emotional impact of the carnage was not diminished, and by ""carnage"" I don't mean that this was gory or sensationalistic - just devastating.
Gus Van Sant wrote and directed and Diane Keaton executive produced this sobering look at an American high school, and it is worth seeing.

1994303,5,B0001EFUFK,"My initial reaction to Elephant was disappointment.  But the more I thought about it, the more I realized how involved I had become in the movie.  Though there is very little dialogue, and scenes glide effortlessly through long unedited shots, I felt as if I was a student at this high school.  The 81 minute movie spends about 70 of those introducing the characters through their interactions with each other and the school.  By the time the climax is reached, I genuinely felt a loss within myself.  I found that my heart was racing, even as the film smoothly and slowly moved through the final moments.
I think that some people will come away from this movie feeling like too much of the story was left untold.  I would tend to agree with that.  Some characters are underdeveloped, but the emphasis on the film isn't necessarily to understand each individual, but to realize that they all represent a different type of student at any given high school.  I'm sure we can all relate to at least one of them.
I was very impressed with the high school kids who were cast to act in the movie.  You won't recognize a single name on the list, save Gus Van Sant.  They all sold their parts well, especially considering their previous acting experience.
If you are looking for a movie that will be action packed and fast paced, this may not be the one for you.  However, if you appreciate film as an art, you will not be disappointed with Elephant.  It left me thinking about it long after I had turned it off.
PS - The extras on the DVD are pretty minimal, for those people who are into that.  There is a pretty lame behind the scenes piece that lasts about 8 minutes, a theatrical trailer, and a trailer for HBO Films.  Nothing else.  I would have liked to see a little bit more about the cast and development of the story.  Extra features don't really matter to me too much, though.

1994304,3,B0001EFUFK,"Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, this film is about a massacre at a high school.  The film is stark, and rather boring, showing the viewers a very ordinary day at the school.  There are long shots of the students walking down corridors.  There are glimpse of characters and incidents that seem to be leading somewhere but do not.  There are unexplained details and one particular scene that is shown over and over again from different perspectives.

There is no real hint of what is coming but the audience is prepared.  After all, we all know about Columbine.  Mostly, I was wondering when it would happen.  And it did.  Violently.

Purposely, there were no explanations and I understand this was the filmmaker's intent.  And so I never got to know any of the characters.  I therefore couldn't identify with them or emphasize when they were so suddenly struck down.  There was also no dramatic background of the two boys who did the killing.  No excuses.  No real history.  Just the pure violent act.
The acting and directing were good.  But that wasn't enough for me.",1088726400,39,1074,4.688172043010753
1994305,4,B0001EFUFK,"Director Gus Van Sant's film is hypnotizing and disturbing.  Filmed in a documentary style, the camera follows several students through one fateful day - one student at a time.  The premise is reminiscent of any American High School.  There are the jocks, the cheerleaders, the bookworms, the slackers, and the everyday kids.  Van Sant has a clever technique where he is able to follow (stalk) each student as they walk down the hallways and pass from one to another as they go through their daytime routine.  We also see the killers in preparation for the possible murders to follow.  Everything is paced in a real time mode with no hurrying or jumpy editing.  The viewer becomes an observer and a participant, watching normal activities slowly unfold to an almost ordinary conclusion - except that it is not. The false tranquility that the film possesses masks the unhappy insidiousness of these ordinary students lives.  These kids could be your fellow classmates and that is one of the most powerful points of this film.",1088640000,3,1024,4.912790697674419
1994306,3,B0001EFUFK,"While a bit wary of films that cover topical subjects like Columbine so soon afterwards, I was sufficiently intrigued by the trailer to seek this out on video.
""Disturbing"" says the box. I'm not really one to believe the blurb on video boxes since being stung once too often by videos that proclaim they are 'Hilarious', but i was a bit more inclined to believe this one.
Intro out of the way, where to start? For me the most impressive thing about this film is the direction and visual style. Such examples as a scene in the school office where you are permitted to hear one sentance from various conversations without hearing the whole of any effectively demonstrate that the substance of these exchanges was not what was important, but rather the overall impression of the day to day goings on.
That was a recurrent kind of aesthetic within the film. The long passages where a character is followed around the school are not really important in terms of plot, and what happens when they reach their destination is not the point. It is clear that these sections are intended to show the variety of people within the school (over the subject's shoulder), to demonstrate the potential scope of the event you know is going to happen. Unfortunately these sections grow tiresome after a while.
This is also the purpose in focussing on several characters, and showing how their lives overlap throughout the day by the use of staggered timelines.
Tension is created and maintained effectively also through the non-linear passage of time, since the viewer is made aware of what is going to happen, and allowed to feel it may be right around the corner only to find that they are transferred to another part of the school at another time.
As the story progresses and we get to know a little of the boys who perpetrate the crime, we are allowed to see how they are able to order assault rifles off the internet and meticulously plan their raid but with no explanation of their reasons for doing so. Though again, the reasons are not the focus. It is the same with all characters; we're allowed close enough to have some level of understanding of them and to feel an empathy with them, but no specific information is given, or indeed needed. It is the focus on the minutiae of the characters daily lives (such as the extended segment of a boy developing some photogaphs, or the geeky girl getting changed) that gives the viewer this effect.
I did enjoy the way the film was made, and the way the story was told, but ultimately I ended up disappointed. It seems to move along at the same pace with the same level of tension throughout, and then just... ends... in the middle of the attack (or perhaps towards the end). It just seems a little lazy to get so far and then offer no denouement. It left me and my girlfriend saying, ""what?... is that it?""
Other problems were that there was no real panic once the attack started. After hearing the footage from Columbine in Michael Moore's film, I expected a little screaming, maybe some people running in blind panic... but none.
And the lad who passes the killers as they enter the school: rather than raise the alarm, call the cops or whatever he just trots around telling the small amount of people who aren't already inside, ""Could you not go in there? Please?""
Except the lack of an ending, these other defects are unimportant generally, since the overall atmosphere of the film is what really counts, and that keeps the viewer riveted.",1088640000,3,3477,4.636952998379255

I decided to watch it again to see if it grew on me at all and it was just worse the second time.  Gus has effectively wasted three hours of my life.  This movie is completely pointless.  It is nothing more than a ""artistic"" recreation of an event that I'm sure most people would rather not see, especially the parents of the Columbine kids.  What is the purpose of recreating a tragic event if you're not going to say something about it?  Is he just trying to rub it in?  Everyone who claims that this is ""real"" and ""hard to swallow"" is just not very intelligent.  This is neither real nor hard to swallow.  It is hard to sit through, however, because its awful.  This could just have easily been a 20 minute short done by a fifth grader.  It may have even been good that way but it's totally unnecessary to hold an uncreative shot for 3 minutes.  It's not creative at all to set up a good looking shot in order to have a girl walk across the floor towards the camera.  That's just amatuer.  There isn't a simgle plot point until about an hour into the movie, which is just a little late considering the movie is about an hour and twenty minutes.

1994309,5,B0001EFUFK,"Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT is ostensibly about the Columbine incident; that is certainly what spurred me on to watch the film in the first place. But when I saw this film the first time, the thing I responded to most was its elegant recreation of high school. The atmosphere, the rhythms, the people---it captures all these things with uncanny accuracy, and it certainly brought me back to my own high school experience. If nothing else, it's an objective portrait of a normal high school and various characters that attend it on what appears to be a normal day until two of its characters (both outsiders, of course) tragically shake it up with pointless death and destruction. It's a movie that merely looks on dispassionately as people talk and things both significant and insignficant happen at this high school. It refuses to make cheap melodrama out of any of the situations or characters, and it absolutely refuses to provide any reassuring answers to explain what could have lead up to this terrible incident. Perhaps there simply aren't any easy answers to be found (despite what politicians, activist groups, and other fearmongers have offered in the past).
A movie about the Columbine incident was bound to be made eventually---it is too disturbing and has caused too much discussion for it to be ignored by the cinema. This was the probably the only way it could be done without cheapening it in any way. Other films might take the incident and fashion a big subjective statement out of it, like Michael Moore did with his illuminating Academy Award-winning documentary BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. ELEPHANT takes a more objective fictional route, and anything less than the definitive film about Columbine, now and in the near future, would be hard to imagine. But to label it simply a ""Columbine film"" is too limiting: it also works as an evocative portrait of the high school experience, and it does so in a manner that could be best described as undramatic yet strangely hypnotic. Highly recommended, though decidedly not for all tastes.",1087603200,9,2044,4.944767441860465
1994310,4,B0001EFUFK,"Not many people saw this movie in theatres, which is probably a shame; I think the mood of the film would be enhanced by being trapped in your seat the entire time. Gus Van Sant takes advantage of the fact that you already know what his movie is about: a high school shooting. He uses your knowledge to his advantage by playing on the tension you inevitably feel as you wonder, ""Will it happen now? Now? Now?"" Framing his shots to limit your view, he lets you wonder, all through the movie, what is going on just outside the frame--and eventually forces you to think about how, if many of the kids you're watching would do the same and think about things outside of their own small worlds, the tragic end of the movie might never arrive. But the movie doesn't offer solutions nearly as neat and tidy as that; it simply allows a day to unfold before your eyes, lets you see the world as it's experienced by both the killers and their victims, and shows both how hard it is to see the signs that someone is capable of such a massacre and how easy it might be if people would only pay attention.
And then there's the kiss, which has caused Van Sant no small amount of frustration. Without ruining the tension for those of you who choose to give 80 minutes to this movie, I can tell you that at one point the two killers, about to head for school to act out their plan, get in the shower together--or does one ambush the other? I'm really not sure if the first occupant of the shower knows the second will join him; I don't think we're meant to think that this has happened before. But he walks in, joins his only friend, and says, ""Today's the day we're going to die...I never even kissed anyone, did you?"" Then the two friends, alienated by the rest of the world, are kissing; the shot lingers long enough to make it clear this is more than a quick kiss goodbye--more like an extended, naked make-out session in the shower.
And then it's over, and the rest of the movie unfolds, including one event, which I'd love to discuss with anyone who sees it, that made me reinterpret the whole friendship between the two killers and their individual reactions to what happens in the shower.
I've made this movie sound like it's filled with action, which isn't fair to those who might consider watching it; much of the 80-minute length of the film is ordinary stuff, like walking down long hallways and playing football and developing film and playing the piano, and much of this plays out without dialogue. I was proud of myself at the end for not speeding up the movie to get down those hallways or get that film developed and clipped; the slight boredom I felt gave my dread an opportunity to build. In the end, this is not an easy film; it won't tell you what you should think about it, and you may not be able to decide on your own what to think, either. I know I haven't. But I'm thinking about it, and that's got to count for something.",1087430400,39,2932,4.361974405850091
1994311,5,B0001EFUFK,"The portrayal of high school in film is rarely reality. High school is dressed up for the screen with beautiful people and sunshining campuses. This movie puts you in the center of your average everyday high school. Regular kids doing regular things.
You've got the photographer who roams the halls looking for the best photo op. There's a geeky girl. Jocks. A guy who gets picked on. Nothing is in this film is done with an ""in your face"" sort of approach because that's not the way high school is. You go, you learn a bit, you chit chat... That's what this movie presents. Van Sant is the first to capture ""A Day In The Life Of,"" a high school day that ends a horrific way.
After Columbine, so many people wanted to know why. People still ask that question. Maybe it's not a question of why. It just... is. This film paints an accurate portrayal of what the day could've been like. It's so ordinary and quiet, but then out of no where the most terrifying thing that could happen actually happens.
This is a slice of life movie, though it won't be one everyone likes or even appreciates. The movie is, as my brother (who recently graduated from high school) puts it, placid. Van Sant makes it clear that no one can know the inner-workings of a high school or the people in it. Everyone has their secrets.
Whether or not you'll like this film, I can't tell you. Some movies you see the preview to and you automatically say, ""Yeah, I know I'll like that one."" You won't know about this one until you actually see it. Great job by director and writer Gus Van Sant and an awesome cast of unknown teens. Simply brilliant.",1087344000,2,1617,4.429530201342282

Maybe they were watching a different movie. Van Sant constructs a largely improvised and mangled plot of a film. The movie drags on and on, the only thing that keeps it quasi-interesting is that you are waiting for the shooting to begin. Static shots that lose people as they walk beyond the view of the seem ubiquitous and endless. There is no character development in the film, the teenagers are really just stereotypes of the typical high school (jock, outcast, arty kids, etc.). Once the shooting starts, it turns into a B-horror movie where characters of course turn the wrong corners and make decisions as if they were caught in some sort of tractor beam drawing them directly to the killers. By the end of the film, I felt as though I was the victim of a cruel joke. Elephant is a self-indulgent mess of a movie. Stay away!",1087344000,2,970,4.645348837209302

Notice how no one even ONCE uses their locker in this so-called ""ultra realistic"" movie about high school. What the heck? I remember high school. I had a locker!
With so much footage of students walking around the halls in this movie, the actors sure could have blocked out their walking a bit better. It looks so unrehearsed and fake. The director should have planned these shots out a little bit better, and maybe filmed the actors walking down the halls from eighteen different directions so we DVD viewers could enjoy the full effect and watch the movie eighteen times back to back, studying its great artistic impact. I don't know if anyone sent the director of this movie the memo about how ""it isn't art if it isn't unnecessarily anal, bewilderingly mundane, and checks all imagination at the door so people can feel important when they watch it,"" but it sure looks like they didn't here. Whew!
I also never got to see what was on the bottoms of everyone's shoes. I felt so unfulfilled when, at the end of the movie, (...)the two guys shoot everyone... and I don't even know what's on the bottom of their shoes. That could have been incomprehensibly important to my own personal imagination, and I am unbelievably mad at the director for ruining my movie experience with this massive slip-up. What's the deal!?
There also isn't one single asinine argument between any of the characters in this movie over something, like a movie that is obviously crap. In fact, no one talks more than a few words to each other about anything. At least they got that part right. I was almost starting to be entertained. And that is NOT what good movies do.

1994314,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant is one of the few films that really captures the audience from it's mysterious story, patient filmmaking and it's honest acting.
A day in the life of 10 students in an unknown high school, where their events intertwine throughout the day, but in that day, their lives will take a turn for the worst as random shootings occur within the school.
A Winner of the Palme D'Or Best Film and Best Director Award at the Cannes Film Festival, Gus Van Sant is one of the few directors who takes an extreme amount of time to place the audience right into the action. I have seen his other film 'Gerry' (which I surprisingly liked) and this one is very similar to that as there are heavy amounts of small talk and long slow steadycam shots. I really like Van Sant; his vision is Amazing and his concepts which at first might seem crazy, but, in the end they really do work. The detail that went on to putting this film together is Outstanding. Anyone who is interested in the fimmaking process (such as I) should go out and watch this movie right away. The precision timing of each individual story as it blends into the other stories are Excellent! (you'll see what I mean) and they are all done in one long continous shot! I also need to talk about the actors, all of them are great in this film. Van Sant held an open audition to actors and non-actors and he casted them perfectly, as they are all high school students with some training in the field of acting and ALL of them were great in it, because who better to play high school students than high school students themselves.
This is a truly honest film. I'm a high school student myself (A Senior) and this film is pretty tame in presenting what teens go through in high school, but it's still just as strong in trying to convey the message. Not only does this film focous on school violence but it also shows issues ranging from family problems, to anorexia up to homosexuality. Even though Van Sant doesn't really dive into the issues and explain why these teens are like this, well it's because most teenagers don't really want to talk about it. Which is why he's sheding a light on these issue to make not only teenagers aware but also parents as well.
Elephant is an HBOfilm that was shown in limited theatres, but now it's on DVD. Though the extras are extremely slim, it's still a great film to watch and learn from.",1087257600,,2379,4.446224256292906

Simply put: You do not have a clue what you are watching. You use fancy words to justify your complete lack of ability to grasp what this film was trying to say. I'm sure I'll be ragged on by those who say that they love film and hate this one. Fine. But keep in mind if you say you hate this movie and then make such convincing statements like ""I watch lots of pretentious art films"" as a justification of your intellect, you are ultimately not fooling any of us. No one who loves ""pretentious art films"" would call them that. There is no such thing as pretentious art films. There's only cinema and the rest.
Now...what was so bad about this film? Boring? Maybe. How would you have done it better? Maybe a little conflict in the hallways; maybe some emotion to force you to identify with at least one of the characters? How about a tragic sacrifice? Would that make it any easier? Of course it would, because these are standard dramatic techniqes that have been in 99.9999(...)% of films out there; and they force you to side with someone.
But how are we supposed to side with a specific character when they all end up dead?  Is one death more significant than the other? ""No"" is the answer from any rational person. None of those kids deserved to die. Everyone of them had their own unique life that was ultimately shattered by a moment of violence.
Think how your own lives go by from day to day much like the characters in that film. Think how ridiculous it would be if someone just walked in out of nowwhere, pointed an automatic weapon at you and shredded you into chopped liver. Would you moan in slow-motion? Would your signficant other walk in front of you and say ""NO! TAKE ME INSTEAD!!!!"" Would you try to grab the gun and save the day? You wouldn't do a damn thing in reality. (We're so constantly inundated with ""heroes"" that we forget that we're all human with human anxiety and human fear. We're humans who would barely be able to stop our own knees from buckling as we tried to run away from danger.)
This is what Van Sant was trying to do. He attempted to be almost entirely objective in his rendering of the shooting: No Elizabethan tragedy; No one character is more important than the other; No one character hogs the spotlight. They are all life.
But, don't take my word for it. The film is crap, right? Go watch Spider-man and leave us pretentious folk to our real films.",1087171200,,2402,4.4343891402714934
1994317,4,B0001EFUFK,"Like I said before with the movie Gummo this is another film where you truly have to study film to get. I've read the other reviews mostly the reviewers didn't get the point & pass it off as pointless. Van Sant was making a truly brilliant point. The way he filmed it in first person filming was very clever. Because it drives the point of taking you into a day in the lives of ordinary kids in a suburban high school. It illustrates how mundane life can be. The reason you don't get to really know the characters was to illustrate the randomness of the killings. How many people do you really get to know in high school you have your select group of friends & thats it. These two kids weren't worshiping some evil force or chanting satanic rituals they were normal two kids who  felt ignored to the world. Thats the truly scary thing about this movie is the explanation of why. What drove them to this point?  As for the scene of them kissing each other was not necessarily  to insinuate homosexuality. I feel the writer was illustrating the point of the relatability of the two on a sick idea. The film has a great build up aspect to it you can literally feel the discontent in Eric (one of the shooters). Filmed very surreal like documentary style that illustrates the point so well and makes it seem real, that is the cleverness of this film & makes you think about it days after viewing. A must see at least once.",1087171200,,1418,4.363636363636363
1994318,1,B0001EFUFK,"The usually astute critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper declared Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" ""brilliant"" and Roeper put it high on his ten best list for 2003.  They especially praised Van Sant for refusing to provide any answers for the school shooting spree it depicts.  Sorry guys, you got it so wrong this time.  Yes, Van Sant is right not to present any answers to a problem that has none.  But shouldn't he have at least asked some relevant questions?
What we have here is 60 minutes of absolutely nothing leading up to 15 minutes of vile and pointless carnage.  No plot, no character development of any kind, no humor, nothing.  The camera simply follows several high school stereotypes (the cute nerd, the photographer, the weirdo, the jock and his girlfriend, three anorexic bimbos, etc.) as they walk through the school during the same ten minute time span (viewed over-and-over again for one solide hour) then follows two homosexual psychopaths as they blow all but one away in sickening detail. Fade to Black.
Actually, all through ""Elephant"" I kept thinking about the painter Jackson Pollock.  I can imagine Pollock accidentally spilling a couple of buckets of paint on a campus, then as a joke signing it and stuffing it away in storage.  After his death, this work of art is discovered and art critics everywhere spend hours studying Pollock's technique and declaring what was nothing but a mistake a brilliant work of art, while the public shakes their head in bewilderment.  That is ""Elephant"" in a nutshell.  It's as pointless as bad ""art"" can be, with no effort, thought or insight expended by its ""auteur"" director, who I wouldn't be surprised meant the whole thing as a sick joke and is sitting up in Portland laughing at those who think this pointless mess is somehow meaningful.
As far as calling the killers homosexuals, of course I know Van Sant is gay and I doubt he really is trying to blame gays for school shootings.  But what then is the point of showing these two making out naked in the shower unless Van Sant is looking for blame (or a cheap thrill)?  It's confusing and insulting to gays who must be getting really tired of being scapegoated for all of society's problems.
As for Gus Van Sant, this guy has to be the most overrated director of all time.  He's made two great movies (""My Own Private Idaho"" and ""Drugstore Cowboys""), one entertaining box office smash and its equally entertaining copycat (""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Finding Forrester"") and everything else has been absolute garbage (the ""Psycho"" remake, ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,"" ""Gerry,"" this debacle).  And poor Timothy Bottoms.  He starts his career with one of the greatest movies ever made (""The Last Picture Show"") which incidentally dealt sensitively and incisively with teenagers, and now in middle age he's relegated to playing second fiddle to a bunch of awful amateur teen actors from Portland, who wouldn't pass muster in a high school production of ""Bang, Bang You're Dead.""  Incidentally, buy the great Showtime version of ""Bang, Bang..."" starring Tom Cavanaugh and Ben Foster.  It covers the same ground, offers no easy solutions and gives us characters to care about to boot.
Ironically, ""Elephant"" won grand prize at the Cannes film festival over Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River.""  ""Elephant"" went on to tank at the U.S. box office while ""Mystic River"" was a solid hit, a Best Picture Oscar nominee and won two Oscars for acting.  In the meantime, the French look down on us dirty Americans for having no taste.  Then again, they think Jerry Lewis is a genuis and Gerard Depardieu was once one of their biggest sex symbols.

1994319,1,B0001EFUFK,"You will be wondering why it is called elephant: Let me explain why, because it is slow and stupid! The majority of the movie is a camera (very low budget camera I might add) over the shoulder following each student through a very large high school building. THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE WHOLE MOVIE. If you enjoy watching someone walk, then maybe you will like this, I' not exaggerating either, Oe of the kids walks from one end of the building to the other in a scene that last for more than 10 minutes. Then when that seen finishes, your right behind another student, and same thing. You will not grow attached to the characters at all. This movie was such a great concept, and they had to crap it up. They could have elaborated way more on the students, the bulling and their lifestyles. This is grade A defecation.

1994320,4,B0001EFUFK,"I imagine that this artifact will be studied at film schools as an object of aesthetic and ethical interest.  Aesthetically, it reminds us that film is an articfact and that the events depicted are being acted - it does this by creating a semblance of ""reality"" in the mis en scene for example where a camera follows a number of characters in long tracking shots through the mundane events of an actual high school on a typical high school day, then repeats them from another point of view.  This apparently Rashomon technique does not however alter the events in any way.  The long tracking shots behind walking students have the dual effect of at first creating some tension along with some irritation that characters rarely actually go anywhere dramatically speaking. The film also raises the question of the effect of tv viewing habits on individuals as one of the killers may have a fascination with Hitler documentaries.
Ethically, the viewer is unable to determine any moral standing by the director except to note that it is apparently very easy to buy guns through the mail in the USA, that bullying may help to turn an individual homicidal, that it is very important, essential, that one has FUN, even when killing one's school mates. One disturbing note is that the two killers are depicted as possibly being homosexual which may undercut a serious point of the film that the killers are in many ways quite ordinary students.  Thus is it fair to imply from the film that classical music playing gay students are more prone to go on a killing spree than football playing straight life guards?  What was Timothy McVeigh? Thus the ethical question is whether as director of a work one is bound to take a moral stance,and whether by making a pseudo documentary one is excused from doing so.
In short, the film raises lots of intriguing questions and is well worth seeing on that basis alone.  The characters in the film are outstandingly believable.",1086566400,,1956,4.789317507418398

I understand that the movie was trying to depict the occurrences as a real life event that is very anti-climatic due to the distance one places between themselves and the world around them. However, if van Sant was not going for shock value there are a few discrepancies I have with this movie. If the goal of this movie was not to shock then why the pointless scenes such as the girls going into the bathroom and regurgitating or the two boys making out in the shower? These scenes, I believe were not necessary to the plot of the movie and seemed as lame attempts to ""rawly"" portray a sensitive issue just to do it. I did like the anticlimactic aspect of the shootings but there was no substance behind this movie.

Throughout the movie, we see several mundane interactions between several different groups of students, and we get to see these interactions from several different viewpoints. This helps paint the picture of an ordinary day in the life of a high school student. Early on we also see two teens dressed in camouflage with guns and we know something is going to go down. We get a glimpse of what happens to these kids during the course of their day. Nothing too out of the ordinary happens to these kids. Sure they are picked on at one point, but nothing too horrific that would justify shooting innocent people.
And that is just the point I got from the movie. Whenever tragic events such as Columbine happen, we are very quick to try and figure out what caused them. Is it the kid's parents? Is it the fact they listen to Marilyn Manson? Is it the way they are treated at school? If not, then what? The kids in the film have very normal parents, one plays the piano (Beethoven, no less), and when they see Hitler on TV they are not even very aware of who he is. They know him by name, but not by his actions.
This movie illustrates that some people, regardless of external factors, are just sociopaths and their actions cannot be explained by ""normal"" people. But that is just what I got out of it. This movie doesn't shove any beliefs into the viewer's face. The best thing you can do is just watch it and see what you personally get out of it.",1086220800,3,1719,4.341614906832298

It could have exposed the true purpose of public education, which is to strip children of their creativity and imagination and indoctrinate them into a lifetime of consumption and obedience. These are the real reasons why some kids ""snap"" and kill as the boys in Columbine did. But this film does not show any of this.  The film is technically sound. It is huanting and the long, tedious tracking shots do a good job of making the point that high school is long and tedious. But that is as far as it goes.

I guess that's what a powerful movie is all about, whether you like it or not. Well now I do like it. A lot! If you're into just pure boxoffice entertainment then don't get this. But if you're open to viewing films as something more than entertainment, you might want to check it out. I sort of think of this film as a painting or a piece of music, because it's visually spectacular and very lyrical. The slow moving tracking shots along with the Beethoven pieces give it a dream-like quality that's very relaxing, oddly, since it's  a very tense build up. It's like I was calm and tense at the same when watching it. The slow pace of the film actually heightens what's about to come because you know what's coming and you feel uneasy about how quiet it is. I think this was brilliant and the lack of explanation of the characters' motives was a good idea. I think everyone would do themselves a favor by watching this film because it's a film that lets you decide what to think, rather than telling you what to think. For this reason alone it's refreshing. I applaud Van Sant's courage in making this film. It's not going to please the masses but I think it's an important film. By the way, why is this film offered in widescreen? I have the DVD and it says the original version was in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Why would you want to watch it in widescreen? The widescreen just cuts off the top and bottom of the film. It makes no sense to have a widescreen version of the film when the original version is in fullscreen. Look at the DVD screen.

The film follows slowly and painfully the last moments of a few students who will later lose their lives (except for the black student, who remains a mute cipher with no past or future). While the filmaker takes some risks in forcing you to endure long shots, the metaphor is well constructed and comes accross. However, it misses the most important part of this story, which is what kind of life does a person have to live to do such horrible things. The only answer Mr. Van Sant gives is a few spitballs; a pathetic and feeble attempt at portraying the torture of adolescence, especially for two kids who will kill several people and then themselves. This is a film made for people who want to be afraid of their children, not who want to understand them. This is an artistic horror movie. This is a big fat gimmick.

Gus Van Sant is smart to avoid turning this into a heavily plotted film, full of interweaving story lines.  He's also careful to avoid trying to direct our emotions in any overt way. He approaches the material with the coldness of a documentary film maker, which is the right approach for this kind of material. Over sentimentilizing the material or focusing too much on the sensational aspects would have dumbed down material that needs to be handled intelligently and objectively if it is to have any impact.  And boy, does this film have impact.
The cinematography is beautiful, full of tracking shots that would make Stanley Kubrick proud. The incredible amount of time spent traversing the school building and grounds has the effect of making the school itself a character. And since the cafeteria, library, gym, playground and halls of this school will never look the same to the children who survive, how appropriate that the school itself is given a life of its own.
""Elephant"" is a strange film to be sure. But it's also an important one.  Of course, the movie preaches to the choir, like most important films do--probably the only people who will see this are those who least need to, but I'm certainly glad I did.

Such fine direction with beautiful cinematography.  The movie  actually takes you back to this particularly ""tragic"" day in history. Such a miraculous transformation for a filmmaker to achieve.
Gus blew my mind with ""Psycho"" with its {frame to frame take}. Once again ""Elephant"", does it with mood of characters and cinematographic choreographic atmosphere. The actors are beautiful and ""Right On"".

1994335,1,B0001EFUFK,"This was, without a doubt, the worst one and a half hours of my life. The acting was horrible for every single character bar none. There was no script and it sounds like 5 year olds improved all the dialog. You will spend most of your time wincing from the awkward performances (or lack thereof) of the actors. The cinematography was nice, but not worth seeing the movie for.
 Furthermore every character in the movie is a horrible clich. From the three bulimic popular girls who vomit in unison, to the dorky girl with thick glasses who gets made fun of in gym class. The movie is repulsive in EVERY sense of the word. Any person who enjoys this movie needs to have their head examined.
 As if the movie wasn't bad enough, the movie goes on to basically blame Columbine on gay people, video games, and documentaries on Hitler. The History channel is turning Beaver Cleaver into a killing machine!
 I would rather have full-armed rectal exam then watch another ten minutes of this pseudo-intellectual waste of plastic. If we lived in any kind of civilized society the makers of this movie (barring the cinematographer) would be publicly executed as an example.

1994338,4,B0001EFUFK,"Of all the adjectives you're likely to hear in discussions of the 2003 Palme d'Or winner, the one most likely to pop up is... Boring?  The surprise of this is, though, that this label is not entirely undeserved.  In fact, I challenge anyone to still through this relatively short film (coming in at just under 80 minutes), without checking your watch at least once.  It's practically impossible.  That being said, this isn't a bad film, and could even be one of the best of the year.  Not only that, it's actually because of the fact that the first hour is so dull that the payoff feels so satisfying.  And that's exactly what makes this movie so chilling, by the time it reaches it's climax, we're are so glad that something is finally happening that we're actually rooting for the young mass murderers.
 Of course, this was just my take on it, and I'm sure that opinions will vary, but the simple fact that when the movie ended, I was forced into doing some introspection, makes this one of the most important films to come out of 2003.
 But, getting around to the question that white, upper-middle-class Americans have been asking themselves in the years since Columbine, ""Who's to blame?""  Well, while there certainly aren't any pat answers offered here, you might be surprised to know that violent films and video games aren't let off the hook.  Not entirely anyway.  Now, don't get me wrong, this is a notion in which I've been extremely adverse to (and still am for that matter), but this movie actually made me acknowledge that they probably did play some small factor in desensitizing the young perpetrators of the rash of school shootings which plagued our country in the late 1990's.
 Let me explain.  This movie intends to push your buttons, and it does so by making you feel exhilarated when one would expect you're supposed to feel sad or horrified.  Which brings me to a confession.  On the morning of September 11, 2001, I felt more excited than anything else.  We've become such adrenalin junkies that instead of being terrified, I actually got high on the notion that anything could happen at any moment.  It felt like being in a movie to me.  Is this normal?  Probably not, but I'm not ashamed, and I actually suspect that more people probably felt the same.
 What does this have to do with the film?  The only way I can answer that is to say, I sensed that the characters in were as bored with their everyday routines as I was with watching them.  So, what do they do?  They go on a shooting spree.  Now certainly boredom this isn't a justifiable defense for these actions, but we're not talking about the ""real world"" here, we're talking about a world in which anything, and I mean anything, justifies our entertainment.  Whether it's watching the planet explode in ""Independence Day,"" or seeing Jim Cavizel tortured to death in ""The Passion of the Christ,"" this is the stated purpose of this medium in which I love.
 It reminds me of a quote from Sean Penn who, when he was on ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" said (and I'm paraphrasing here), ""If all you want is to be entertained, get a couple of hookers and a magic eight ball, because film is just too important to be wasted on that (popcorn entertainment) alone.""
 Is he right?  Well, while I tend to agree with him, who am I to pass judgment on all of Hollywood?  After all, the first two-thirds of this movie, the parts which deal with the mundane reality of ""normal"" life, I found to be slightly tedious, while I actually enjoyed (that's right, enjoyed!) the final twenty minutes, as the young killers opened fire on their classmates.  I guess, that's what makes this the very definition of a guilty pleasure.",1085443200,,3684,4.623076923076923
1994339,2,B0001EFUFK,"I really don't know how to explain my feelings about this movie. The box from the rental place says 'What began as an ordinary day in the lives of ordinary teenagers became a day no one would ever forget.' And that's exactly what it was. Ordinary. It was an ordinary day for an hour. Kids walked around their school. Except it wasn't ordinary. Not one of the characters seemed real at all. They all floated in a strange place between reality and stereotype, as if they knew they were in a movie, so they were scared of being realistic, but they knew it was supposed to be realistic, so they were scared of being too stereotypical. It tried so hard to impress upon you the idea of normality, but, in the end, all it did was lose the audience's interest before it even had it. It just seemed to self serious for anyone else to possibly take it seriously. It wants desperately to be some great piece of art, and it's finally convinced itself that it is, and now it's just hanging on the wall for the clueless masses to fawn over, never thinking that maybe formlessness doesn't automatically assume greatness. It's like a knockoff of a truly great piece of art. You can see where the aspirations were, and you can see precisely where they weren't reached.",1085270400,,1251,4.491228070175438
1994340,2,B0001EFUFK,"Why do critics seem to need to proclaim any film which portrays life realistically as ""brave""? This film is different and original--but it is still dull, and hardly brave. If filming life as it actually may look has become the pinnacle of film-making, then critics have low expectations indeed.
Van Sant chooses no sides in this film. His lens is impartial and distant.  Most of the film consists of following his characters down empty hallways. The message of isolation is accute, but do we really need it drummed into our head with such dull repetition? Anyone who has been in an American high school knows this--must we really relive it over and over again?
Many reviewers have praised Van Sant for his use of non-actors (actual teenagers) and objective scope.  True, he shows the gritty reality of life for the American teenager from many angles, and he never chooses sides, or romanticizes.  He examines the many motivations the killers may have been influenced by, but never draws conclusions.  By the end of the film, however, I felt as narcoticized and detached as his killers--which I'm sure was the point.  But, if a movie is going to leave me commpletely unmoved emotionally, then it should at least be thought provoking.
This is where the movie completely fell through for me.  Some critics and reviewers claim Van Sant is being original and brave by delving into the motivations behind Columbine-type situations.  Some say he is pointing to the ""elephant"" in the room that no one wants to talk about.  However, anyone who went to school since the nineties (or even watched the news) heard all of Van Sant's themes explored in vast detail.  We questioned the media, parenting, bulleying, and violent video games in much the same way Van Sant does in his movie.  The fact that Van Sant draws no conclusions, as if to say that there are no simple explanations for teen violence, is not original. My friends and I (and probably most rational individuals) came to the same conclusions around the time of the Columbine killings.
Gus Van Sant has some great potential here. He does a good job of placing his viewers in the same mindset of his young characters.  However, this is only thought-provoking if you are someone who hasn't given the subject of teen violence much thought, or weren't aware of life for the average American teenager.  Otherwise, this film is just a dull rehash of themes that have been previously explored.",1085184000,4,2436,4.829326923076923
1994341,4,B0001EFUFK,"Ok
Elephant is a great unforgettable film. When I watched this movie I felt something I never felt before by watching a movie. I felt changed but like most movies you can't helped to have critism. Gus Van Sant has worked with actors such as Matt Damon ,Ben affleck, and sean connery, all great actors but he couldn't have better actors for this. The Acting is very important especially for a movie with so much emotion. He made it seem like school shootings happen everyday at this school but Gus Van Sant's brillant directing makes up for all that. It also seemed like half the kids in this school never went to class and they didn't seem to surpised that there friend were getting shot but the directing makes up for that as well. I was really impressed at the directing mainly because of the way it was shot. How they made it in each kids point of view its  builds to a really cool different kind of ending which is the best part in my opinion. I can't tell you everyone will like this movie but its one everyone must see. That's why I have mixed feelings about this movie because the acting is terrible but the directing is brilliant.",1085184000,,1138,4.393364928909953
1994342,5,B0001EFUFK,"Elephant is an amazing movie that draws you in and allows you to observe a tragedy unfold slowly before your eyes.
There's no moral message here...Van Sant trusts his audience to make up their own minds about why it happened, by simply following ordinary students on an ordinary day, completely oblivious to the fate that's about to befall them.
This is brilliant filmmaking.  Van Sant skillfully interweves each of the characters with different perspectives on each interaction and time-shifting to build the tension.  When the inevitable violence comes at the end of the movie, it's quietly intense, making it feel more honest and real than your standard stupid Hollywood shoot-'em-up.  In other words, your subwoofer won't shake, but your hands will.
I rented the DVD, so I haven't seen the extra features.  However, the sound & video of this DVD is strong, even in the 4:3 original aspect ratio.  I believe the film was shot on DV, so obviously the video quality is superb.  The sountrack is offered in DTS 5.1, DD 5.1, and Stereo, along with French & Spanish mono tracks.  The DTS is very expressive with nice background touches (listen for the birds), even though the rears & sub don't see a lot of action.  All in all, a great presentation.
I'm going buy this DVD and I encourage you to as well.  If you want your intelligence to be engaged, give this movie a chance.  You'll be pleased, and a little uneasy, at the end.",1085011200,,1427,4.717741935483871
1994343,5,B0001EFUFK,"""Elephant"" is a return to older forms by Gus Van Sant, a director who through the commercial success of ""Good Will Hunting"" now has the financial freedom to make films the way he wants them, without consideration for mass-market appeal. This is not a mass-market film, but it *is* a mass-market subject, hence the title ""Elephant;"" like the elephant in the room, this is a topic everyone knows about, but no one wants to really talk about. By depicting a very Columbine-like school shooting without explanations for what we are seeing, I think Van Sant's message is that we *should* be talking about this and doing everything we can to prevent another one from happening. Oddly enough, only yesterday a planned school massacre only miles from my hometown was foiled by police just days before it was supposed to happen.
The most common complaint I have read in the other reviews on this site are about the ""boring, pointless tracking shots that go on forever."" Yes, they do go on forever, and I found them to be absolutely hypnotic. Ten minutes into the film, a five-minute unbroken shot depcits football practice, a young girl stopping in front of the camera to look at the sky, finally focusing on a young man (""Nathan""), as he dons a sweatshirt and walks into the school building, all while Beethoven's ""Moonlight"" sonata plays on the soundtrack. Absolutely nothing to further any expected drama happens, and yet I found this shot to be extremely sad and powerful. These are little moments in which nothing is really happening, somehow sweetened by the knowledge of what's to come later. As Paul Bowles once observed, how many times will you remember such a tiny moment of your childhood, that while apparently insignificant is such a major part of your being? I think that's what Van Sant is going for here.
The camera tracks through hallways, following students in their daily goings on. Things move at the speed of life; no rapid-fire editing, no setups. This is life as it unfolds on a seemingly normal day. Then we eventually begin to focus on the killers.
Van Sant provides no explanations as to their behaviors, although there are moments of hinted homoeroticism, and such ""mixed signals"" as one of the boys playing Beethoven on the piano while the other plays a violent video game. We see them sleeping; we see them on the morning of the massacre, calmly eating breakfast, engaging in casual conversation.
""Well, this is it; we're going to die today"" one observes, stepping into the shower to share the only moment of physical affection they will ever know.
Then there are the killings, presented in a manner that does not glorify the violence; it just happens, again with no explanations, no action-flick editing, and nothing set up to pull the heartstrings. It ends before the deluge subsides, with another inexplicable shooting (was it agreed upon beforehand?) bereft of any emotion from the killer. I won't give away the final shot, but notice how the camera slowly backs away from this moment as if it can't bear to watch anymore.
The photography is top-shelf, the editing, by Van Sant himself, is masterful. Van Sant obviously has feelings about the subject here, but he is very responsible in not trying to give the viewer any answers. I think all he wants is for people to talk about it, and just accept this sad poem for what it is.",1084924800,2,3352,4.791018998272884

1994345,5,B0001EFUFK,"The story begins with a boy and his father driving to school. By 9am the father is drunk and the boy is contemplative about life and the disarray that surrounds him. What made this film so brilliant was that the chilling truth that surrounds high school life was so realistically depicted. There are these long shots, lasting for 5-10 minutes dealing with perhaps some of the most mundane aspects of life. A boy playing the piano, a girl running while contemplating life, a boy and his father in awkward silence, the jock walking across the school, and a killer with no motives but simply to kill. I call these mundane because sometimes life is that way, and through movies, it seems to be neglected. Eric, one of the shooters says, ""So foul and fair a day I have not seen,"" as he walks down the halls with his M16 as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata plays. Perhaps he is trying to say that sometimes we don't know what causes us to do the things we do, although he realizes his actions, his insecurity with life caves in, and his instant gratification is appeased, but the foul outcome will never satisfy his un-known motives. When the movie ended I was waiting for more, something to explain what would motivate someone to these actions. But I think that is the point of the movie. It is saying that with shootings, and with life in itself, we don't understand the motives of high school adolescence nor do we understand how to react to the situations that baffle our minds. The movie showed a general reaction to a crisis. Rather than panicked hysteria, the rampage caused numbed emotion, because sometimes, in situations so foreign, no one knows how to react, or how to scream.",1084665600,2,1677,4.630872483221476

  No emotion was every really developed.  Every single murder is bluntly unemotional, and the movie becomes as unemotional as the murders.  But, this may be Van Sant's point: that acts of violence are pointless under the conditions in which they take place.  But because Van Sant never discusses these conditions, the movie is pointless.  It isn't perceptive or insightful, it just bears an unbiased witness.  Which is confusing when Van Sant has the two killers share a naked, homosexual kiss in attempt to add emotion where there is none.  This movie lacks emotion and ultimately becomes forgettable.  2 1/2 Stars.",1084579200,,964,4.810975609756097
1994347,4,B0001EFUFK,"This film has received quite polarizing reviews; some praised its understated brilliance while others bashed it for its lack of action and dialogue and its tortoise-like pace. In my opinion ELEPHANT falls somewhere in between. The viewer is introduced to a variety of students at an anonymous high school in America. The camera follows behind them as the students engage in their everyday activities resulting in a clear sense of being a voyeur. There are periodic sound bites of somber piano music along with many stretches of the silence of walking down the school hallway. The tone of the beginning of this film reminds me of the calm before the storm: the interplaying of scenes of the two kids mail ordering guns and target practicing in the garage is a clear indication that something big is about to happen and there's no way to warn the others.
There is little doubt that ELEPHANT is far from the center of filmmaking. It fails to explain any reasoning behind the massacre of the school shooting and the viewer is left with an unsettled taste in their stomach, especially after watching the final scene. However, this aspect clearly mirrors how school shootings are always clouded in mystery as to the killers intentions and motivations. In a nutshell this film is simply one individual's interpretation of a Columbine-like event. Criticize or praise it, but at least try to get what Gus Van Sant was trying to say. 3.5 stars.",1084406400,,1434,4.857142857142857

1994349,4,B0001EFUFK,"""Elephant"" the Gold Palm winner at last year's Cannes Film Festival is a hard movie to react to. Even though I've seen it straight through I feel as if I missed something and need to see it again. I think after a second viewing I'll be able to fully comprehend the movie.
 I'm familiar with both sides of the public's reaction to this movie. And I guess both make good cases. ""Elephant"" is a bit slow moving. Not exactly involving. There is no personal audience involvement. And I didn't relate to anyone in the film. I saw this with my sister and afterwards I said it was an interesting movie that I ""think"" I enjoyed. She said it was awful because the movie didn't resolve anything. It didn't tell us why the event happened. It didn't take me very long to respond back ""what's the difference WHY it happened it simply DID happen."" Do we really need to know why violence happens? I think this is what Gus van Sant was going for. Violence happens and while yes it's a terrible thing we may never be able to get it down to a science and explain why it happens.
 ""Elephant"" despite some of its ""flaws"" has some interesting aspects. I liked the long unbroken camera shots. I liked the mood the film created, even though it seems many didn't. I enjoyed some of the performances and liked the music, which consist of ""Moonlight Sonata"". And above all ""Elephant"" does seem to be about something. It is exploring an issue. Granted many didn't like the way it explored that issue, but you can't deny it tried.
 A movie like this is clearly going to divide people and only be enjoyed by a selective few. This is not everyone's ""cup of tea"". Those who going into the movie with a clear mind and are willing to go at the movie's pace will enjoy it. But the casual movie fan will find problems.
 Bottom-line: Interesting film from Gus van Sant I needs to be seen more than once to fully comprehend. It's a difficult movie to watch and may challenge your patience but I think does have its rewarding moments.",1084320000,2,1995,4.427792915531335

The first two times I saw it it was fresh and exciting, but by the last couple of times I wanted to fall asleep.  Opinion wise, I personallly did not enjoy the movie.  That may seem odd to some, even my own cast and crew.  I talk about it often because people ask me questions and I respond in a courteous manner.  The only good thing was a fat paycheck and the chance to met new and beloved people(especially a certain young gentlemen on the cast).

The movie seems almost mechanical and detached, filming everything in a documentary style but with no explication.
  Other flaws - a very slow build-up to the inevitable conclusion, no depth to the characters, a certain choppiness.

Even in high school (I'm 27 now) which I still have nightmares about having to go back to, things were never so bleak and mundane.

I know that each individual character is depicted just to get a mindset on the day and what high school is like and the such, but we get nothing from a kid walking down the hall for ten minutes with four words spoken-and that wasn't from the kid.
Even the end was unrealistic.  I know they weren't trying to explain, but the kid was seeing all this stuff happen (Benny) and didn't do anything.  *Blank stare* Yeah.  It DOES have meaning; you just have to constantly think to even remotely udnerstand it.",1084147200,,729,4.458646616541353

Before viewing the movie i had very hgih expectations. and suprisingly enough it met every single one of them and more. Elephant is by far my favorite film. I've watched it 4 times so far and each time i realize something new and more of the symbols come into mind. If your not prepared to have a slow moving movie before you get to the last 15 minutes of the intense part, don't watch it. but if you are prepared to understand the different characters and wait till the end for it all to wrap up.

1994359,5,B0001EFUFK,"I keep coming across so many indie films of the past year, and I have been pleased with most all of them, but this one was an underappreciated gem that got very little attention. This is hard to believe because you'd expect a film like this-with its disturbing subject matter-to draw a little more attention to itself. I had heard that it gained a bit of attention at Sundance, and that it was going to be one of the most controversial films of the year, but it didn't turn out to be that way. Instead, people just blasted Gus Van Sant for even attempting to make the film, ridiculing him and brushing the film off as if it meant nothing-a flawed cinematic acheivement.
Alot of these people that persecuted him really, as it turns out, don't know what they are talking about. They dismissed it as nothing but a series of endless tracking shots, following one student after another until the horrifying climax, adding up to nothing, and offering no answers, no easy way out for the audience. What they don't know is that that is the whole point of the film. It follows each individual or group of students around for minutes at a time so we can get an idea of who they are, what they're like-their humanity. These are just ordinary kids at and ordinary school in Anywhere, USA. They had no idea that two conflicted youths were going to walk in the school any minute and start blasting away. It's all an effort to get the feel of an ordinary day in high school. Believe it or not, each day doesn't just fly by. High school, depending on your experience, can be a long, boring, drawn out experience. Gus Van Sant wants the audience to ""get it"", but sadly not many people who have seen this film did. Thats very unfortunate, because the series of events that follow the observations of each student are so horrifying and sad that you don't even know what to think once the film is over. You feel like you got to know each of these kids for a while, even though all we did was follow each of them from a distance for a few minutes. I can't really explain how I feel after watching it. All I know is that I won't be able to get it off of my mind for a few days.
See it, but brace yourself - have an open mind.

Anyway, I put it in my DVD and was instantly shot back to Lost in Translation.  It wasn't heavy on dialogue, and the filmmakers paid close attention to shots.  I also enjoyed not really knowing too much about each character.  It left us thinking.  Once I realized it was about a school shooting I had to shut it off.  I graduated last year from high school and the thought of a school shooting scared me to death.  I knew how to get out of every classroom.  It didn't help that we had practice lock downs incase of a school shooting.  I left it for a day and returned to it and forced myself to watch it.  I'm glad I did.  It was amazing, beautiful and tragic.  Yes, I can see how some people would think this as a boring movie, just as people think Lost in Translation is.

1994361,5,B0001EFUFK,"This achievement of cinematic quality is an amazing look at an everyday high school, experiencing everyday boredom, that is interupted by cataclysmic events. This movie offers little in the way of explanation, thereby avoiding the political problems that movies of this type enter into. Yes, there are hints of an agenda at work. The teasing of the less popular, the intimidation by the beautiful girls, the ""PC"" video game violence influence, oppressed homosexual feelings of rage, lack of parental influence, and more all come into play, but in the end, no explanation is given by the filmmaker. This is actually what I enjoyed most about this film. It just happened. Does there have to be an explanation? Acts of violence aren't always rooted in some deeper cause. Perhaps the director simply wanted to say that the kids who would do something like this were just bored with life. Perhaps they were tired of living and sought to go out with a bang. The discussion that this movie raises is the best product of the movie. Good cinema causes good conversation. 5 out of 5.",1083801600,2,1073,4.836956521739131
1994362,3,B0001EFUFK,"Van Sant's too hip to tell a story or offer explanations or motivations. His long, beautiful shots of boys walking around are set to Beethoven to show how touching young men are, and how troubled. It's a poem, sort of, to male teenage angst.  These boys walk away from the viewer, down the empty hallways of high school and adolescence, always turning their faces from us, always hiding their sensitivity and pain.  Suggestive shots include a janitor mopping behind one walker, erasing his footsteps. Another shows boys playing a violent video game after one becomes frustrated practicing piano. Get it?
Toward the end, a couple of them take a shower together, then shoot up a high school.
It's atmospheric and deliberate, and by no means awful, it just doesn't do much. Despite the repitition of one scene from different points of view, you'll never think you're watching Kurosawa or Tarrantino. Not as excrable as ""Kids"" or as masterful as ""River's Edge,"" it's finally just Van Sant's arty meditation on high school boys.

1994363,4,B0001EFUFK,"I will make this review concise. This movie is full of suspense because we can all relate to the average mundane routines that Van Sant portrays. Suspense is quite the opposite of mundane and routine; however, Gus Van Sant makes watching these routines stressful because you know that they are eventually shattered by a complete destruction of everything that high school kids take for granted.  What makes this a frightening film is that life is portrayed as we know it, not as Hollywood tells us it should be. Knowing what we know about Columbine, the tension is only increased by the repeated portrayal of the common and unremarkable. You will feel anxious right as the movie starts, not because of special effects or moody music but because all you need to do is walk to your local high school and you will see the underpinnings of this movie at play every day.
  While we do see an average day in a high school setting, this film's underlying theme can be just as easily applied to the workplace or to life in any American home. Elephant focuses on an average day at any high school in America.  That is all you need to know. The direction by Gus Van Sant is subdued and anti-climatic without trying too hard. All of the high school cliches and cliques are lightly touched upon. I am in my late 20's but for 80-minutes of this film , I felt like I was back in high school going to gym, lunch, and the library all over again. That is a scary thought for reasons that I could have never imagined at the time.",1083628800,,1511,4.444043321299639
1994364,3,B0001EFUFK,"The supposed triumph of ""Elephant"" is also its own downfall. Gus Van Sant's ""Elephant"" was laurelled with the Palm d'Or because it offers no explanation, no justification, and no insight into the tragedy of the Columbine massacre when two estranged teenager murdered 13 innocent lives. ""Elephant"" is not about Columbine but on another high school, which further implies Van Sant's message that a tragedy like this can occur anywhere else at anytime. That is partially true but very insulting because these sorts of event shouldn't just pop out at any random time and location. To offer no hint of reason or justification is understandable, yet irresponsible on Van Sant's part.
The first hour of this film we witness numerous tracking of the characters as they pass through empty hallways while we're just lagging behind. We first track John (John Robinson) being driven to school by his hammered dad. They stop, John tells him to get out and sit on the passenger side, John gets behind the wheel, and then more tracking. Then a slew of characters begin to appear on screen, going about in their normal lives like normal teenagers, taking advantage of their supposed safety while we in the audience know something is brewing. We follow some characters individually through flashbacks that run into other characters we eventually meet or have already met. Why does Van Sant show them in particular? I guess if perpetrators are randomly selected than so are their victims. Nothing has set rules.
Stanley Kauffmann of ""The New Republic"" labeled ""Elephant"" as a ""braggart piece of empty exhibitionism"" and I am inclined to agree. The first hour is so meaningless and bland that there is no reason to watch this movie, which is already aside from the fact that Van Sant intentionally offered no discernment to this matter. ""Elephant"" is all about fashioning the exterior as Van Sant plays with the camera by seamlessly tracking its players and shooting long shots. The cinematography is lusciously solemn and Van Sant tries to fill the emotionless gaps with classical scores of Beethoven but it merely widens it. Van Sant flaunts ""Elephant"" for being unconventional and becomes so preoccupied with it that he leaves it hollow. ""Elephant"" is as empty as the hallways we tracked.

1994365,4,B0001EFUFK,"I had been eagerly anticipating seeing this film ever since I first heard about it. Unfortunately, I missed it in its brief showing here in town. However, I was FINALLY able to see it today on DVD, and I was far from let down.
""Elephant"" does not provide easy answers to quell our fears and sense of loss over school shootings. While it does address potential triggers for why it occurred, the director never casts blame on any of the proposed catalysts. Instead, director Van Sant goes for a new (and stunningly realized) approach---making a ""real"" film. The movie follows a group of teenagers on what is an ordinary day at school--getting dropped off by your parents, detentions, classes, bullying, lunch break with friends, teasing in the locker room, etc. I found this extremely effective, as it builds a level of tension in every frame; you just never truly know when it will hit the fan. The way in which the film alternates back and forth in time (similar to Tarantino, but not exact) also escalates the suspense further, as little details and sounds (ie Michelle in the library when we hear a shotgun rack--this will probably make your heart jump as bad as mine did!!) start to clue you in as to how things will unfold.
However, what truly makes this film work is the way in which it brings memories of high school floating back. I had several instances of deja vu so strong I had to shake the chills off my back. Once it is all over, you begin to ponder what would have happened had this occured in your school, and would you have been someone to cause such atrocity.
This is definitely not an easy film to watch. It seems extremely tedious at first, but once you begin to relate to it, you become enveloped. For anyone that wants to ponder such events in relation to their own school years, and try to make their own conclusions on why such things happen, I would strongly reccomend this fine film. It is definitely one I will watch again soon.",1083628800,,1954,4.538243626062323
1994366,1,B0001EFUFK,"I've heard all the arguments about this movie and it is completely pointless and boring.  If you want to know what high school is like just drive by your nearest high school, park in the parking lot and observe.  Or talk to the neighbor kid who is in high school.  Either way, both of those options are more exciting than this craptacular movie called ""Elephant"".
  This film tries too hard to be an art film and yet fails miserably.  It is supposedly an excercise in voyeurism but it is just all too boring to hold the attention of the audience.  Everyone already knows that some kids get made fun of in high school.  Everyone already knows what happened at Columbine.  Sure high school can be tough and depressing at times but this is just ridiculous.  I like the idea that this movie was trying to convey, yet it is just so boring and badly done that it can't keep my attention for more than 5 minutes.

  Please save yourself from this horrible film and watch Evil Dead II instead.  It actually has more meaning and depth to it than Elephant has.",1083628800,4,1050,4.429319371727749

I think it's very not american movie and Van Sant's best well maybe not his best but my favourite. It's an unusual movie to come from the ""great USofA"" beacause it makes you think and really touches you somewhere inside (at least it touched me). I know it may seem boring, nothing is really happening here as in Die Hard series or other ""ambitious"" films. But if you're a real movie fan you will see the genius in this movie:great cinematography,great script, great direction, good cast and the slowly builded atmosphere. And the final is truly...it's even hard to describe...I was at least speechless.",1083628800,,736,4.6692307692307695
1994368,2,B0001EFUFK,"In spite of the unreliable disclaimer in the end credits -- to the effect ""The events depicted here are not related to anything in real life"" -- everyone knows that ""Elephant,"" which won two major awards in Canne, and co-executive-produced by Diane Keaton, is based on the shooting at Columbine.
And the director Gus Van Sant knows we know the fact while watching the film.  We know the film is NOT about an ordinary day in a fictional highschool in Oregon (a disused school stands for the film's one), where the camera follows the ordinary students and teachers (and a drunk father) played mostly by amateurs.  So ""John"" is played by John Robinson, and ""Alex"" by Alex Frost, and so on, excpet the few professional actors like Timothy Bottoms as John's dad.
And the tragic thing happens, which I don't think needs further explanation.  The film depicts the two boys' atrocious deed with drab, realistic touch, being intent on showing the things as they are.
The film is, to me, unnnerving, and is never boring for I know what will happen in the end, and clearly Gus Van Sant knows the effects coming from that.  The film's long, continous shot as if floating in the air works to make the unsettling effects even though some may say, quite rightly, that the director is self-indulgent in sticking to the intention, not culculating the effects on us, like many arty films do.
In fact, the minutely worked-out camerawork is quite memorable, to be fair, and the actors are very good and convincing though it is palpable that they are not trained pros.  At least they are natural, and as a whole, promising if they want to continue the job.  (Actually John Robinson went on to be in next Asia Argent-directed film.)
What I do not understand about the film is ... hard to explain, but the fact the film is made at all.  I know this is a slice of life in 1999 April 20th, but do we have to watch this ""thought-provoking film"" (which it is) while we are still thinking about the incident?  I respect the director's decision to leave out any attempt to explain how come this happened, but after watching it the film starts to look pointless, even though that may be exactly what it aims for.
I said the film does not explain; in fact, it does.  There is a suggestion about Nati, violent video game, Internet, and even the boys' sexuality.  Probably Van Sant wants to criticize, with these references, the possible ""causes"" suggested by the media.  I know, but by introducing them, ""Elephant"" begins to show, unknown to itself, the comtempt to these characters which should be more rounded.  My advice is, just strike it out.
To be frank, I do not know why the film is made while there are many people suffering from the aftermath.  ""Elepahnt"" will offers the occasion for you to share the moment of that day, but I do believe this is the documentary film's job, not Michael Moore. but someone with more balanced-viewpoint.",1083628800,,2913,4.643968871595331
1994369,5,B0001EFUFK,"I knew nothing about this movie going into it except that it was a portrayal of columbine.  This being said, I expected a documentary type film that focused on motives, characters, and sketched out a cause and a blame for the shootings.  Boy was I wrong.  What I found instead was a film that portrayed true reality much better than anything I've ever seen on TV or a movie screen.
A sense of normality is established within the first few minutes of the film.  Knowing that something bad is going to happen makes every scene build with tension as we watch high schoolers go about their everyday lives, which are so simple, yet so complex, each one special in it's own way.  There is no true explanation to any of the events in this movie.  They just are.  This is how real life works.  The shooting just happens.  This is how real life works.
The shots and sequences in the film and their drawn out nature combined with the forementioned reality sent deep chills through my body and mind while I was watching this film.  Although the expected violence happened, there was no true climax to the movie.  No relief, and no resolution.  Just reality.  Therefore, chills remained in my spine through the silent credits, the walk to the parking lot, and the drive home.
This movie makes no point of morals or what is right or wrong with our society or high schools.  The point that you should gain from this movie is that what will be will be, and although true-life events are not sugarcoated, as most movies portray, there may be no rhyme or reason to the events that may occur.",1083542400,,1574,4.496478873239437

It seems to drag everything out but school is a 6 hr day that is endured by teenagers 5 days a week. It's a normal part of the week for them. No student went there anticipating a shooting. The point of the film was to show that no one had a clue what was ahead of them. The director was trying to make the auidence feel like a high schooler by following around 5 or 6 them during the movie.

the thing is, i liked the idea, but jesus, try to make it keep my attention for more than five minutes. yes, our lives are full of mundane activies, but that doesn't mean you have to show ten minutes of some guy walking down a hallway.
i just wish that the director had fleshed it out a bit, made us feel something. it was pretty emotionless, and all i kept thinking was, 'just get to the point already!' and when it finally got the point, it was a properly DISSAPOINTING point.
this film contains about five million loose ends that are never resolved, virtually no character development, and an incredibly piss-poor ending. it gets two stars, however, because it really did have potential, but somewhere along the line it got completely mangled.",1083196800,,802,4.776978417266187

What annoy's me is the fact that people all over the world are abolishing a great film simply because it deals with a tragic event. This is not the forum for a moralistic or political debate, however, something has to be said about the power of film making if a single film generates such a barrage of disruption in a rather mundane socity.",1081555200,2,564,4.380952380952381
1994373,4,B0001EFUFK,"Personally, I thought the movie dealt with such a sensitive matter quite well.  The film felt fresh, unbiased and real, I believed the characters that I saw.  Gus Van Sant has left lots of things in the movie that people can latch on to if they want, to say that he is blaming this or that for the killings, but he seems to remain completely objective to me.
Regardless, I think there is a monumental failure here that everyone is overlooking.  Within the pages of this site, people spend hours writing critiques and arguing about which camera shots should have been used for which scenes, etc...  I would imagine that the director's point in making a movie like this was to bring the issue of school shootings up and have IT discussed from as many viewpoints as possible.  In this, the film has failed.  Love it or hate it, people seem to be dissecting the medium of the message and not the message itself.
To me the message is straightforward: ""here is a bird's eye view of a difficult situation that reflects someone's reality"".  I don't know if he is intending to tell the Columbine story, as there is no mention of it in the film (text or spoken), but regardless it struck me as being very close to reality.  If it doesn't to you, then perahps it would be beneficial to realize that it does to others and that's an important realization.  By this I mean that although a Vietnam movie doesn't ring true to you it may do so for people who lived through it themsevles.  One person's reality is another's ""bad"" movie.
As a matter of fact, this whole group of reviews is quite representative of the aftermath of such school shootings... people gathering around arguing about tangential topics not really involved with the pressing issue itself.  Then again, this is a movie review database, so perhaps that is an easy excuse to ignore my criticisms here.
I think the movie raises an important issue and it does so with respect and intelligence.  That's what counts and thus I do value it for that.",1080777600,,1997,4.563025210084033

Gus Van Sant obviously was trying to get into the life of teens in America. From what it looks like he did a good job, seeing as I'm a teen, and happen to live in America.  The teen life protrayed in the movie, weather it be boring, or exciting, is the way teens in America see life as.  Its a lot of hiding, and a lot of shawdow.  Unfortunatly if people who did see the movie did not see past the shadow, and weren't drawn into the movie, missed out.

1994375,3,B0001EFUFK,"Well I saw this movie back in December and it hasn't left my mind since. I would give this movie 3.5 stars. My reasons are varied, but I'll start off with the fact that your attention really isn't immeresed in the film. What I mean is that a whole movie really can't just be a camera following kids around their classes the entire day without at least different camera angles or more dialogue. I can undertstand that Gus Van Sant was trying to be unique and different by sort of having the camera float around the school hallways too give it an eerie and gazing sense of feeling, but most people's attention spans aren't too good. I found myself to be on the edge of my seat this entire film, however, due to the fact you never knew when the climax would begin, in every single scene the slightest noise of something my heart would beat fast, just because you are anticipating the worst that is going to happen. This was effective throughout the film, and actually the only reason why you don't fall asleep.
HOWEVER:
This movie was very, very, very innovative. I was expecting the entire movie to be a gorey mess of drama and action, it was not. It was more just a very strange sadness throughout the film, because the audience is merely ghosts watching teenagers on what seems to be an ordinary day in high school, but it isn't and we know their fate is not too pretty. I really can't explain my thoughts on this film, it was just different. DO I recommend it? Yes, it will give you alot to talk about and most likely stick with you forever.",1078617600,5,1542,4.395104895104895

I was stunned by not only the graphic honesty of the film, but also by the supreme acting on the part of the inexperienced cast. For someone who was in high school at the time of the Columbine shooting, this movie not only tells of the horror and senselessness of the event, but it also has a much more subtle sub-story: the truth about American high schools. I left the theater feeling very moved. The movie really places you in a position that feels as though you're seeing the tragedy really unfold before your eyes. I highly recommend Elephant to anyone who ever had to endure the torments and torture of high school. This is a movie that will leave you with a very deep impression.",1077321600,2,797,4.503448275862069
1994377,1,B0001EFUFK,"I was expecting and hoping for exactly the kind of film Gus has produced here, but I have to say that despite this I managed to find virtually no merit in his movie whatsoever (except the time-lapse bits...they were nice).
Ill start with the acting, which ranged from reasonable to awful; the woodeness of it all gave me splinters dude!  And as this is a film where the kids have to do nothing but walk around looking bored and boring one has to wonder what went so horribly wrong.  It was at this point that I came up with my motto for this review, BLAME THE MAN, BLAME VAN SANT! For it can only be his guile-free direction that managed to coax such below par performances.
Right, now onto the issue of the lonnnnnnnnnng (did I mention long?) tracking shots that make up this film.  Now I like a good tracking shot as much as the next man, but the amount of pointless time-fillers crammed into this 90 minutes is an insult.  One scene has the camera pan down a sleeping boy over his floor and then down his sleeping friend on the couch.  Why?  No reason, thats why.  But at least that scene is only about 20 seconds long, the one that follows some random jock from American Football practice, through the school grounds, through the school and into an office lasts a good 5 minutes and provides the viewer with nothing but the back of his head to look at and surrounding kids mucking about.  Yes, youve managed to make the school seem functional Gus, but if I want to watch the goings on of a high-school Ill go to a high-school mate, how about some drama, some meaning, CHRIST ANYTHING to break up the horrible horrible monotony!!! BLAME THE MAN, BLAME VAN SANT!  And don't give me any nonsense about the point of the film being to establish a feeling of average-day normality, it doesnt wash with me, Gus.
Ive rarely sat so slack-jawed at a directors temerity to shoot 60 minutes of a high-school and its dull as ditch-water inhabitants (You want bullying? Check! You want a geeky PE dodger? Check! You want endless tracking shots? Check! You want vaguely alternative types high-fiving? CHECK CHECK and thrice CHECK!!! Sod off Van Sant; your artiness is as hollow as the Geneva Convention flaunting tips on Yank bullets!) and try to pass it off as a movie.  And don't get me wrong, Im no action junky wishing hed focused more on the shooting itself, the ending did nothing for me either.
Whose fault is this?  Ill give you a clue, BLAME THE MAN, BLAME VAN SANT!
The most unforgivable aspect of this film however is the crass heavy-handedness with which Gus deals with the important issues he takes on.  The first things we see of the home-life of the murderers in this movie are (in order) German composers, violent video-games, Demonic drawings, Hitler and (out of nowhere!), for no other purpose than to shock, a gay clinch in the shower.  For goodness sake Gus, could you have covered any more of the left-wing scare-mongering bases fella?  Having one of the protagonists be a carbon-copy of Eminem was lazy too you big jessy.  Just as lazy as me labelling you a hypocritical, war-dodging, cowardice inflicted frog with garlic breath.  So what if Im disregarding the fact that you were born in Kentucky?  Hey, you started it buddy!
Now, I seem to have gone off the point to a degree but fear not BLAME THE MAN, BLAME VAN SANT! for goading me into his lily-livered trap.
Back to the flick (yes I know its hard, but lets try folks) and it seems that whilst he had me distracted old Gus has managed to pack in another shoddy piece of filmmaking.  He claims this is a documentary, my cinema ticket claims that its a dramatisation; but laughing in the face of both, we have a final 10-minutes of HORROR MOVIE CONVENTIONS!  Darn right baby!!
Kids walking around high-school corridors as they burn instead of darting for the exits (there are just 2 of these murderous kids, avoiding them shouldnt be too hard), ignoring the blood smeared walls and dead bodies for the opportunity to walk around in a vest looking tough and to top it off, a shed-load of people who could have disarmed what amounts to a limp-wristed geek but instead choose to make themselves sitting ducks by turning and running.
Many a B-movie director has avoided falling into this trap, so why does this film fall into it?  You know what time it is kids!! BLAME THE MAN, BLAME VAN SANT!
The total lack of tension as the token black-kid gets blown away is insulting too.  The guy just walks up to a fully-armed murderer without any apparent plan or attempt to thwart him.  Stop insulting you audience please.
I can only shake my head and fear for what this worthless director is doing to Van Helsing as we speakHeaven help us.",1077148800,7,4693,4.542111506524318
1994378,5,B0001EFUFK,"Being 16, myself I have never been so captivated by a teenage drama in my life. I love movies, I enjoy the thrill and irony it bestows upon it's audience. But never has any movie actually moved me the way Elephant did. No beautiful adjective could describe such a masterpiece. The score, the editing, even the camera angles were nothing short of perfection. Every frame that passed was hardly taken for granted and if I could be part of any movie ever made I would no doubt chose this one.
The plot it self follows different characters throughout what one would call a normal high school day. The way the characters are filmed and followed is extremely unique and couldn't have been done a better way. To me, I couldn't believe how much that movie was like school, the conversations and actions those kids had were almost too close to believe. Well, except for the whole shooting thing. That was what got me the most, the second I caught a glimpse at the two boys walking up to the school with all of their ammo and weapons I was fearfully hooked. I had no idea what to expect from the movie considering I knew absolutely nothing about it when I first walked in to see it, but at that moment I knew what was going to happen. A different prediction that hasn't happened with any other movie. The fear in the actors' eyes looked real, sitting there watching it I could feel it and hoped that no one would ever have to undergo such tragedy at school again. That's what the movie made me feel, as if I were standing in that hallway with the victims. For that last 45 minutes, I was briefly taken away from my reality and brought into an extremely scary world of misfortune. It was almost beautiful, the feeling of being taken away by just a movie, no other movie has ever made me leave myself in order to make it through. I could barely drive home afterwards.
Although my review sounds dark, this movie is definately one not to be missed. I wish every single high school, maybe even middle-school, student could witness this movie. Who knows, it might change so many horrible things even though that's what it's about, it's different seeing it from a different perspective. It's a truly amazingly made movie, it's so good it's practically scary. Watch it, and you'll understand completely.",1076371200,7,2285,4.548543689320389
1994379,4,B0001EFUFK,"In under ninety minues, a fluid, objective camera plunges into a normal Oregon high school on the brink of a violent ""Columbine-style"" shooting. We meet a number of students and hear their conversations, learn bits about their lives, see who goes to the bathroom to vomit up their lunch, find out what that shy girl in gym class is going through - and meet the shooters as they prepare and finally (pardon the expression) execute their plan. Elephant is by no means plot-driven - shots meander from behind students through hallways for minutes at a time. It also makes no attempts to prech or editorialize about the atrocity of school violence. Elephant is simply 'there,' as attentive during little moments of seemingly no consequence as it is during the graphic altercation that closes the film. I admired the strength and flow of Van Sant's film, but Elephant stands as a movie that can be admired but never really enjoyed. This is a bold, brave film, but also a very challenging one that offers no solutions but plenty of things to keep you awake at night. Something about Elephant really impacted me, though, and that was Van Sant's choice to not try and tie things up in any way - neatly or in a messy fashion. I believe that is because there is no easy solution or explanation for this school violence, and Elephant preys on our deepest fears that it can simply happen without much pretense. The film would have been less effective had the somewhat-improvised dialogue and performances of the teens been less real - every word coming from every mouth, and every gesture is organic. With such identifiable characters, the school shooting takes on a disturbing, morbid air with Van Sant's brilliant choice - it's not sensationalized one bit. The multiple murders have the same pace as the languid tracking of the first part of the film, and that is where it is obvious that Van Sant truly has something to say. It may take a while for it to become obvious, but with some patience and thought, Elephant can emerge as the most thoughtful exploration of random school violence yet produced. Aside from Andrew Jarecki's terrifying documentary, Capturing the Friedmans, Van Sant's Elephant could just be the most bizarre and thought-provoking cinematic experience of the year.

8011287,1,B0001EFUFK,"I think that the film totally dragged. The tracking shots of many of the students went on way too long. The 360 degree pans were way overused. The shot compositions and the audio quality was extremely amateurish. It seemed like the DP was extremely lazy and wasn't willing to go the extra mile to get a more effective shot or to take additional pick up shots to add more drama and visual esthetics to a scene. Besides the obvious use of a steady cam, the film looks like it was made by a college film student at best. The acting was beyond deplorable. The students looked like they were about to crack up in most shots or seemed to show a shy smile because they were on camera. I actually think that the film would have been much more believable with professional actors and a professional sound crew. Gus Van Sant sure got what he paid for in this movie.... A cheap looking, sounding and acted film. Gus Van Sants direction is no where to be found in this movie on every level of filmmaking. ie., shot composition, sound and acting. Gus Van Sant should take up another profession, if this is his future quality of filmmaking.",1513900800,,1126,4.444444444444445

8011290,2,B0001EFUFK,"Since it's a movie about high school shootings and only 80 minutes long, I hoped for a fast paced hard to stomach commentary about society and violent. I feared a movie glorifying violence or alternately being so scared of doing so that it showed none of the horror. What I got was long shots of teenagers meandering aimlessly through hallways interspersed with unexpected scenes which aimed to keep the experience unsteady and uneasy. If the movie had a larger goal I couldn't see it. Since it wasted the first 2/3 of the movie with horrible pacing, there was no investment in any character or group so the deaths felt appropriately random but inappropriately soulless.

This is much more of an art experiment than a real movie. Experiments with showing long shots to convey time, experiments with untalented actors and dull high school minutia to convey realism, and experiments to make teen death and killing look as emotionless as possible.",1495670400,,944,4.937106918238993
