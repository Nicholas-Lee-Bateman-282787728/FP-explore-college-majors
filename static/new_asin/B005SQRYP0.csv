8485294,5,B005SQRYP0,"Garfield and the gang are back in The Garfield Show: Dinosaurs & other Animal Adventures, consisting of six more 11-minute episode on a single disc. This new release is all about animals.

The episodes are:

Down on the Farm - Jon, Garfield and Odie visit Doc Boy on the family farm. Garfield teaches the animals his way of living.

The Pet Show - Garfield gets reject from a pet contest because he is too fat, so he enters Odie into the contest. Garfield wants Odie to beat Nermal and win the grand prize - lasagna!

Bone Diggers - Odie finds a rare brachiosaurus bone in the back yard. Garfield tries to sell the bone to a museum, and the museum owner, Mrs. Brubaker, plans on tearing down Jon's house to find more bones.

Underwater World - Jon takes Garfield and Odie on a fishing trip. The cat and dog fall into the water where they encounter talking fish.

Fish to Fry - Jon is babysitting Liz's pet fish, but all Garfield sees is lunch.

History of Dogs - Garfield tells his viewers his version about the history of dogs, which is mostly negative.

I grew up watching Garfield & Friends and the CBS specials, so naturally I had to buy this DVD. I wish the producers would release a full season set, but until that time comes (if it ever does) us fans have can enjoy this six episodes DVD release. The shows are cute enough for kids to like and funny enough to entertain adults.",1347148800,3,1384,4.37890625
