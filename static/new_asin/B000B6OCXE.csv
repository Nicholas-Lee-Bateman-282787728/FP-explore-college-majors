No problem with the return or refund (except for the time involved in telephone calls, packing, shipping, etc.), and deep disappointment. Unacceptable to sell something that has no value for the buyer.

Being able to watch as well as listen added a new dimension to this art form.  The images were clear; the audio fine.  There were English subtitles.  I thought that Mr Eschenbach's accompianment was fine, but remember I do not play piano nor am I an expert in this particular musical art form.  The bonus was a master class for a Mozart aria and recitative.  There were subtitles in English so that I could follow the German conversation.  It was very interesting to watch Mr Dieskau at work with a younger performer.  The is very little of Dietrich Fishcer-Dieskau available on DVD, unfortunately, as he was a great performer.",1359331200,,799,4.697841726618705
8082563,3,B000B6OCXE,"It pains me to give a three star review for Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau since I admire him so much but here goes.  This recording was made late in his career.  All the wonderful qualities that made him the 20th greatest singer of lieder are still present, yet his voice is definitely less sure.  But for DFD's singing alone, I would have rated it higher than three stars but for me an even bigger detriment is the piano playing of Eschenbach.  It's clunky and inelegant.  If you're used to the playing of Gerald Moore or some of DFD's other better accompanists you will likely find him wanting.  Lastly, one big warning.  According to Amazon, this DVD is good for all regions.  However, the DVD I received (from a third party vendor) was not region coded and stated that it was good only for PAL players.  I don't know what that means, but it wouldn't play on my DVD player so I had to watch it on my computer.",1351123200,4,907,4.4156626506024095
