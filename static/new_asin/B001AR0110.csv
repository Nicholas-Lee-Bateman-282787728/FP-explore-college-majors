I like the premise, single mother, kind of, kids, job, school, but come on, every man wants to date her? Really? She goes to bail her kid out of jail cop asks her out, she locks herself out on the balcony fireman asks her out come on.",1504828800,,388,3.7439024390243905
8278878,4,B001AR0110,grace under fire is a great show. they should put all the episodes on dvd. and they better or there will be alot of disapointed people out in the world. if anything it should appeal to their greed. we will pay for this show.,1304208000,,224,4.113636363636363
8278879,5,B001AR0110,"I have been looking for this item and what follows it for a long time now. It is one of my favorite shows. I have some of the later seasons on tape but not the earlier ones. With all the smut and other crap that is on tv today what is the deal with not making this one available. At least it is not as bad as half of todays tv shows. I don't care to watch tv as much anymore due to the crap that is on. Come on - if we want to buy it, what is the problem? It is not illegal, or porn(which we cannot seem to be able to get rid of). I hope they get this cleared up soon.",1252195200,,568,3.552
8278880,5,B001AR0110,"What ever did happen to Grace Under Fire Season #1.  It was supposed to come out last year and pulled at the last moment.  Barnes & Noble still has it listed in their computer at my local store, but it now has a weird release date behind it that the manager couldn't figure out either!  Why would the manufacturer just pull it without giving a reason.  One good reason I don't pre-order TV DVD boxed sets from amazon.com anymore.  I know it's the manufacturers fault and not Amazon, but having to deal with the anticipation and then the disappointment and the refunds, just isn't worth it, anymore.

  Unhappy TV DVD boxed set freak!",1237593600,4,633,4.539823008849558
8278881,1,B001AR0110,Does anyone know why this was pulled out of circulation??  Wasn't it scheduled to be released 9/30?,1222732800,,99,4.823529411764706
8278882,5,B001AR0110,"They are finally releasing one of the greatest shows on dvd but now it says its going to be discountinued, Carsey Warner is one of the worst and I do not support them this show needs to be on dvd because it has such a huge fan base and Brett Butler is an incredible and witty actress who delivers more then ive ever seen she is right up there with Roseanne and thank goodness that was realeased on dvd so people out there like me don't let them ruin this for us KEEP GRACE UNDER FIRE ON DVD PLEASE...........",1221868800,14,508,4.141414141414141
8278883,4,B001AR0110,"Grace Under Fire is such a great a show and one of my personal favorites. I'm glad to see it finally make its way to DVD. However, I won't be picking up my copy until I can be sure that all of the seasons are coming out.",1221782400,,220,3.702127659574468
8278884,3,B001AR0110,"I have a strong suspicion that this show will NOT be uncut, network versions.  Carsey Warner has screwed fans over with releases of Roseanne, The Cosby Show, A Different World & 3rd Rock From the Sun being syndicated & NOT saying a word.  In fact, Roseanne herself had to step in before they released uncut seasons of Roseanne!!

Carsey Warner has also NEVER put out proper season sets of Season 1 of The Cosby Show, A Different World, Roseanne or 3rd Rock From the Sun or made ANY announcements saying they'll do so.

I hope Brett Butler has some pull here & knows about Carsey Warner's history.  Maybe she'll keep her show unmolested; if there's no assurance that this will be the original network airings, I'm not wasting my time.  If, however, Carsey Warner proves me wrong, I'd get the early seasons since they were great.",1214524800,11,827,4.63013698630137
8278885,5,B001AR0110,I loved this show. It debuted way back in the mid Nineties and I never even heard of comedianne Brett Butler. She was a mother of 2 and the father was not around because he was an alcholic and she herself was a recovering alcholic. She was struggling to make ends meet and she had a best friend Nadine (Julie White) who was also hillarious. She was always cracking jokes and it at times got a little PG-13 but still very funny. Her rather large M-In-Law was meddlesome to say the least but Grace knew how to handle her and she wouldn't even admit her son was a terrible father. I'm thrilled to see they are finally putting this on DVD.  WHAT TOOK SO LONG,1213401600,9,654,4.232
