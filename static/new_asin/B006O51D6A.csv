8501595,4,B006O51D6A,For neighbors I host a travelogue video night --- they liked this travelogue.,1438300800,,77,5.0
8501596,3,B006O51D6A,"The music by Grieg is well played (too bad not by a Norwegian orchestra).  The filmed scenes are beautiful
and attention is given to edits to match the flow of the music.  The three stars are due to the rather soft focus
of the video images.",1429488000,,241,4.217391304347826
8501597,5,B006O51D6A,This is a DVD that you can put into your player and have the beautiful scenic pictures of Norway and the magnificent sounds of Grieg music. It just doesn't get better than that!,1400803200,,177,4.393939393939394
8501598,3,B006O51D6A,"Scenes of an old restored Norwegian village from the 19th century with short piano pieces by Grieg.  None of Grieg's suites or concertos, mind you; only short piano pieces that you likely never heard before.  No narration, so you have no idea why some of the scenes were selected.",1394582400,,280,4.6938775510204085
8501599,4,B006O51D6A,"Good item but I wish it was not in musical form and was a narrative without the music. Other than that, it was nice and I shared it with a friend.",1365724800,2,146,3.7419354838709675
8501600,2,B006O51D6A,"Very jerky, amateurish filming.  The Childrens' Dancing would be better accompanied by the actual Dance Music rather than by the music from  the Peer  Gynt Suite.",1364515200,2,162,5.153846153846154
