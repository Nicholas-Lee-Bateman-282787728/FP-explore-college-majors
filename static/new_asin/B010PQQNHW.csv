8722907,1,B010PQQNHW,It is absolutely ludicrous to charge $60 for part of one season of a show. I'd have to sell my first born child to see all of them.,1511740800,,131,3.7142857142857144

8722909,1,B010PQQNHW,"This is a great series, probably my favorite anime series. Im currently watching it on netflex but wanted to get a hard copy of it to have in case it ever was taken off. Unfortunatly, i recently discovered that Aniplex release the series in 8 volumes (4 for season 1 and 4 for season 2). Then they charge about $60 per volume. So if you buy them here it will be $240 investment for 1 season and a $480 for both seasons. Thats without shipping costs if there are any. I cant justify paying that much for any dvd series. Thats outragous. Im deeply disappointed in how much money they are asking for because it means i cannot get them. Alot of people feel the same. They want people to buy the series and stay away from pirated copies or illegal streaming yet charge $400 or more for two seasons. Unless you have the money to blow i wouldnt buy the dvds until prices are lowered. Unfortunatly this is very disappointing, i love this series.",1467504000,19,937,4.36

8722914,1,B010PQQNHW,"This anime has a ton of plot holes, poorly written characters, terrible writing, sexism, a Gary Stue of a protagonist, and one of the worst fanbases ever.

If you want a great analysis as to why SAO II sucks in much more detail go watch Digibro's ""your anime sucks SAO II"" videos. It goes through each episode and why things are bad for you so you don't have to suffer through the episode like I did.",1447977600,,400,4.2631578947368425
