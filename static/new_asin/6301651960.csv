341447,5,6301651960,"How a snake was turned into a super-killer by being infected by ""cancer-infested rats"", I don't know.  What I do know is that anyone with an ironic sense of humor will love this film!  The acting, the writing, the stunts, the special effects--all choc full of intentional and unintential laughs.  For an extra round of chuckles, be sure to listen to the earnest & not-so-earnest producers' commentary---the interaction between Andy Sidaris and his wife is priceless.  If you liked ""Showgirls"", you will LOVE ""Hard Ticket To Hawaii""!",1074211200,6,532,5.080459770114943
341448,5,6301651960,"""Hard Ticket to Hawaii"" is the first of twelve (that's right, count 'em, twelve) Andy Sidaris ""Bullets, Bombs and Babes"" movies to be released on DVD, and as an introduction to the series it can't be topped. It's absolutely topless!
So, for a good stretch, are Playmates Dona Speir (March 1984) and Hope Marie Carlton (July 1985), who play supersecret agents Donna Hamilton and Taryn Kendall in this absolutely riotous take-off on James Bond. Except that even Bond never took as much off.
Frankly, recent Bond movies with their adrenaline overkill and obligatory explosions owe more to 'Hard Ticket To Hawaii' than it owes to them.
The plot, where it exists, concerns a drug-running ring on the Hawaiian island of Molokai. Donna and Taryn are assigned to stop the evildoers, who are led by a Goldfinger-like leader who delivers contraband in a radio-controlled helicopter (a scale model, not a real one...guess the drug business isn't what it used to be on Molokai).
Somehow, the storyline changes from smuggled drugs to smuggled diamonds along the way, but who cares? Dona and Hope Marie are clearly having a good time on camera, are so appealing (even when they're really trying to act) and the movie is so absurdly funny that anybody looking for a little element like a storyline should have his head examined.
Our secret agent friends spend most of their time either running around 85% naked in khaki jungle short shorts, 90% naked in the jacuzzi, or 95% naked kissing the tanned, buff men in this movie, but they do manage to subdue the bad guys in the end. Somehow.
In the interim, we are treated to such unforgettable lines as ""Let's hit the jacuzzi...I do my best thinking there,"" ""I don't want to control your life, I only want to suck the polish off your toes,"" and ""If brains were bird poop you'd have a clean cage.""
We also run afoul of a homicidal skateboarder armed with a pistol and a blow-up doll (why?) and a transvestite who is spying on the spies. Plus any number of nubile women, none of them at all foul.
The most memorable acting job of the film belongs to a giant rubber snake (don't be alarmed) who provides an interesting subplot (much more interesting than the plot plot, when you think about it). It seems that the giant rubber snake has been contaminated by ingesting cancer-infested rats, and wreaks havoc on the smiling islanders by ingesting them. By far the most memorable scene concerns the snake's sudden appearance from an exploding toilet, giving rise to the shouldabeenaOscar-winning line, ""Just when you thought it was safe to take a..."" Well, you know.
Sidaris' light touch is evident in the fact that each chapter of the DVD is listed with a chart indicating whether it contains gunfire, explosions, or bare breasts. Sidaris is strictly tongue-in-cheek. The film contains no full frontal nudity and no adult language, just a lot of innuendo. A lot of it.
The Special Edition DVD also has a chapter of the ""Andy Sidaris Film School"" in which the Writer/Producer/Director/etc. Sidaris (Mrs. Arlene and Mr. Andy, actually) engage in some very professional technical discussion of filmmaking. Although they'll never be Kubrick, they are serious about making a high-quality film on a shoestring budget, and it shows in their careful and clever filming and their breathtaking location shooting. And they do give some relative unknowns an acting resume, to boot. Anyone interested in how films are made needs to watch this.
Be prepared. ""Hard Ticket to Hawaii"" is pure, sunshiny enjoyment!",1039824000,25,3522,4.891304347826087
341449,5,6301651960,"This movie is simply incredible.  If you liked Sorority House Massacre II (and I know you did), you will love this movie.  It has babes, bazookas, bozos, and an intriguing mystery to boot.  OK, the last part is stretching it.
This movie follows two women who work for a charter plane/cargo service in Hawaii.  They become targets, or somebody they know becomes targets, or something (who cares) of some Evil Bad Men.  Their Boyfriends (the women, not the Bad Men) show up, after flexing and acting like [fools] on their boat for a while.  Within a few minutes they encounter a Random Killer doing handstands on a skateboard.  The Random Killer makes a second pass and manages to wing one of the Boyfriends, but the other shoots the Random Killer with a rocket launcher.  Very cool!  Another nice subplot is the Infected Snake (very realistic, let me tell you) who shows up in a sort of surprise ending that left the entire audience stunned.
The director's commentary is pretty cool because it explains some of the scenes that would otherwise make no sense.  They still don't make much sense, but the commentary is cool.  The video quality is very good, as is the audio.  The plot quality is low, as is the acting.  There is no shortage of nudity and violence.  Excellent all around, if you like this kind of [junk].
A slightly sad note: Andy Sidaris (the genius who directed this), claims to have twelve movies out on DVD, but as of this writing only two are available.",1022025600,10,1469,4.621621621621622
7813426,4,6301651960,"Andy Sidaris strikes again in this extremely cheesy send up of Bond films set in beautiful Hawaii. Unsurprisingly most people who watch this will be looking forward to seeing low budget mayhem and pretty women, and ""Hard Ticket to Hawaii"" delivers that, but it delivers a lot more. The film starts with the murder of two cops on Molokai by a ruthless drug smuggling gang. In the first ten minutes we are introduced to our heroines Donna (Dona Speir) and Taryn (Hope Marie Carlton) who in reality are both former Playboy models, but here we are supposed to believe that they are top drug enforcement agents. There is also a hilarious witness protection program backstory unfurled while they are showering, but prior to getting in the Jacuzzi where they do their best thinking. (Really.) Also in the first few minutes we meet the real star of the show, a hilarious giant snake puppet. That's not a euphemism. This is the funniest thing I have seen in ages. There's confusion in the snake warehouse and the girls (who are pilots) fly their Cessna 172 with snake cargo to a secluded part of the islands. It develops that two snakes have been switched and the one they have is ""contaminated"" from Department of Health experiments involving feeding it bad rats.

Don't get too bogged down with the plot such as it is, as it's just an excuse to show the girls doing various things and some occasional gunfire and explosions, but you knew that already. The girls get caught in the middle of the world's least believable smuggling operation, as the evil mastermind stuffs his radio control model helicopter with diamonds and they just happen to be there when it lands and, naturally, take the loot and escape back to their seaside lair in their Cessna where they analyze their close brush with death in their Jacuzzi. The bad guy wants the diamonds back and shortly vengeful instructions are being forwarded in a note in a sandwich. A couple of martial arts types then practice their craft a smidge and get the best line in the film: ""Confucius say: man with deadly hands must be very careful when slapping on aftershave""! It will not surprise you that these girls get caught with their pants down (figuratively) by home invading thugs who want the diamonds back. Please note the ""Malibu Express"" poster over Taryn's bed; Andy Sidaris never misses a promotional opportunity. Additional subplots reveal themselves in rapid-fire succession: there's a lengthy monologue on vitamins and nutritional supplements punctuated with the line ""man I sure love soul food"" and an Uzi-wielding thug engaging in a game of Frisbee and dying in the most spectacularly funny way I have ever seen in an action movie. I definitely laughed out loud. The film concludes with an epic battle of good and evil that contains gratuitous toilet snake and rocket attacks.

If you are looking for a piece of mid-'80s (1987) cheese featuring a birdbrained plot, atrocious acting, insane personal interactions, and the greatest snake puppet in film history, ""Hard Ticket to Hawaii"" is the cream of the crop.",1469145600,2,3066,4.860420650095603
