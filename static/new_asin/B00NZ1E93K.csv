6697051,3,B00NZ1E93K,"I've been a fan of the original film versions of Marius, Fanny, and Cesar for a long time.  I discovered them when I read they were Alice Waters' favorite films, and that she named Chez Panisse after the character of Panisse in the trilogy.

With that I was looking forward to these versions for a long time, and finally ended up buying them individually from Canada several months before a U.S. release.

Well, that was a long time ago now, and I'll be honest with you, I found Marius so completely lackluster and lifeless that I STILL have yet to even watch Fanny (and have stopped caring whether the final film, Cesar, is ever made and distributed).  [UPDATE:  I finally watched Fanny and felt exactly the same -- lifeless.]

The actors are gorgeous, Daniel Auteuil opens up the action somewhat (I especially remember beautiful boat scenes on absolutely gorgeous and clear blue water that are not in the original), but the seaside interaction and camaraderie of the characters outside the cafe in the originals are largely missing here, and the set-bound scenes feel almost phoned in.  Dull.  Lifeless.  And sad to say the result of Auteuil's plodding direction.  Everything lacks immediacy and any kind of intensity so we might care right along with the characters about their plight.

Part of it may be that the story hinges on an unplanned pregnancy and it's not the shocking thing it once was, but in the original films you understand the characters' distress about it.  Here it's more, eh, whatever.

When I read the critics were all panning these films I expected to love them anyway.  Surprisingly, I had to agree with them this time, and I'm still disappointed about that.  This is a lost opportunity, with many of the elements right, but an overall feel of having seen the living characters in the original and now watching their lifeless ghosts in this version.",1423440000,,1874,4.794392523364486
6697052,5,B00NZ1E93K,"Both movies are excellent, and one follows the other, so buying both was an easy decision. I've loved almost every movie made from Marcel Pagnol's stories/movies/plays. Daniel Auteuil did an excellent job directing and acting in these movies as well as his movie, The Well-Digger's Daughter.",1422489600,5,291,5.3478260869565215
6697053,5,B00NZ1E93K,"In recent years, popular and respected French actor Daniel Auteuil (Queen Margot, Cach) has focused on adapting time-honored plays and scripts by the venerable Marcel Pagnol for the contemporary French cinema, starting with The Well-Digger's Daughter, a gem.  His latest Pagnol-derived project is Marius and its sequel, Fanny; though released as separate films, they are an entirely intertwined diptych demanding to either be viewed together or at least in close temporal proximity.  In early-20th-century Marseilles, Marius (Raphal Personnaz) is an indecisive and intense youth employed in a pub by his grumpily brusque, but also doting father, Csar (Auteuil).  In his own way, Marius is in love with childhood friend Fanny (Victoire Blzy), but he also longs to see the world and for adventure on the high seas.  The couple's shared story--the betrayals, the embraces, the twists and turns of fate--unfolds over the course of the two films.  Presented by Auteuil in an old-fashioned and subdued, but entirely confident style, these are an absolute delight:  well-acted, moving, picturesque, avowedly romantic, elegantly scored by the prolific Alexandre Desplat, and quietly haunting in their conjuring of old-world provincial France and its social mores.  In the near future, Auteuil reportedly intends to round out his envisioned trilogy with a third and final chapter, Csar, and I very much hope he does.",1418256000,11,1407,5.456221198156682
8681141,5,B00NZ1E93K,"Many people have commented that the remake of the beloved Marius & Fanny trilogy is disappointing, but I strongly disagree.
I can only say I loved every minute of it and cannot wait for the release of the third chapter Csar!
The casting is excellent, and the nostalgic Provence atmosphere is captured very well. Bravo and chapeau Daniel Auteuil!",1512604800,,345,4.864406779661017

the replacement had both discs that worked fine.
The Marius disc in the order did not work.",1503792000,,153,4.5

8681145,5,B00NZ1E93K,"Classic Pagnol retold beautifully; keeping the sets muted and simple echoes the original films; but the acting and
photography are top notch; Of course, the Fanny movie is the heart of the trilogy exposing all the themes seeded in
the first film. Like Jeanne de Floret and Manon of the Springs,
 it's the second film that brings the power of the story and its issues into high relief.
Hopefully, Auteuil will complete the trilogy.",1458172800,2,430,4.8108108108108105
8681146,5,B00NZ1E93K,"Two great movies based on Marcel Pagnol's books. Daniel Auteuil produced them and stars as well. Fun, funny, yet addressing timeless issues. A great set to show French students in French class, by the way! Lots of cultural material. English subtitles available.",1455926400,,261,5.238095238095238

8681148,2,B00NZ1E93K,"Sorry I can't like this version of Marcel Pagnol's classic film, but compared to the original with Raimu as Cesar, Auteuil's effort is puny.  The actress taking the part of this new Fanny, though pretty, has one mode--weeping--in fact, the only character with any real presence is Panisse.  More importantly, Auteuil's reincarnation of the Fanny Trilogy does not capture the flavor and charm of the original's Marseille waterfront neighborhood, a character in its own right in the Pagnol film. Like a Chinatown or a Little Italy, this comunity is its own world within the larger metropolis.  Do yourself a favor; go for the real thing--the 4-disc Fanny Trilogy from the 1930s, written by Marcel Pagnol and directed by Alexander Korda.",1437868800,2,734,5.1
8681149,4,B00NZ1E93K,"A splendid remake of a french literary classic. Daniel Auteuil who has a long association with the works of Pagnol, directs a fine cast of young actors (Personnaz, Belezy) and veteran performers (Darrossin) in this excellent two parter.
