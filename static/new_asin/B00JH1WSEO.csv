6357021,1,B00JH1WSEO,"this was never officially released as a dvd. it came out in 97 as a two VHS tape set. and due to legal issues within the record lable by the time dvd had come about they were not able to put it out , both interscope records and trent reznor said that this would never be released in this format and it has not yet been.  THIS IS A BOOTLEG...AND YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE DVD FOR FREE FROM VARIOUS WEBSITES. the fact that someone is even selling this is breaks the law.

dont waste your money on this",1232928000,24,494,4.030612244897959
6357022,5,B00JH1WSEO,"This is an amazing DVD. The sound and video really are stunning. This is easily the best concert DVD I own and most closely recreates any concert experience I've ever had. It's wonderful, exciting, vital stuff and I highly recommend it.",1227484800,,236,4.780487804878049
8650778,2,B00JH1WSEO,"Bootleg with poor VHS-like quality, not worth $30.

Interscope never released this on DVD - although there were plans to do so.  Instead, Trent leaked it on to BitTorrent after there were numerous delays.  If this is taken directly from what he leaked, I'm really disappointed.

If you have this on VHS don't bother with this.",1459641600,2,326,4.767857142857143
8650779,5,B00JH1WSEO,"Wow this one took a long time to get my hands on!  This was supposed to be released in the US about 10 years ago and never quite made it to the market place, at least I never found a copy, and in fact most places are still selling the VHS version that is still available.  If you are unfamiliar with Closure it is a two DVD set (or VHS) the first disk features a on the road documentary of early NIN on tour and lots of live footage up to the Woodstock show.  Lots of backstage antics with NIN and support bands, a nice segment of Trent and David Bowie.  The second disk is all of the early videos that NIN made up to The Perfect Drug.  A warning on the video's these are completely unsensored, and can be a bit disturbing, definitely not to be shown around kids.  Now onto the copy of the DVD that I received, this was a global enterprise as the copy of the DVD I have was made in Brazil, and the credits are in Portuguese.  A copy of this DVD made it's way to Sweden, and that copy was then shipped to Colorado and to me.  And yes it was worth the wait.  There are a bunch of extras on the DVD that were not on the VHS versions such as the making of The Perfect Drug and others.  If you are up for a good chase, try to find this one.",1458172800,,1235,3.904

8650784,5,B00JH1WSEO,"Being a huge NIN fan, I had been wanting to purchase this for a long time. I ordered it and was thrilled. This set contains the absolute best music videos I have ever seen. This is some truly intense work. Trent Reznor is brilliant and did a wonderful job choosing his directors. The first set contains the Self-Destruct tour, and is a fascinating look at life on the road in a rock band. They play all the goodies live (The Only Time, March of the Pigs, Hurt w/David Bowie as an added bonus, Piggy, Wish) and it has some truly hilarious moments when the guys are just sitting around (For example David Bowie tells about a time when he did Under Pressure and someone was curious why he did Vanilla Ice covers). This is a great DVD, it brilliantly captures the concerts. The second DVD contains the greatest music videos ever made. Head Like a Hole is hallucinatory and migraine causing, Sin is sadism caught in beautiful cinematography and lighting, Down In It is a colorful visual feast, Pinion is a disturbing, thought provoking piece, Help Me I'm in Hell is brilliant and repulsive, but not nearly as close to revolting as Happiness in Slavery. This is the most hideous thing I've seen since ""Salo."" It depicts a man strapped to a sadistic looking chair where he is sliced up and poked and prodded, and mangled. This is pretty heavy stuff, not for the light-hearted. Then there is Gave Up, a good video that shows us the band in the studio, the same goes for March of the Pigs, which is also beautifully shot, then there is the live versions of Eraser, Hurt and Wish: All very good. Then there are the two treasures of the entire set. Closer and Perfect Drug. Both are amazing in their style and unique cinematography. Closer reminds me of something Kafka or Marquis De Sade would write about. With all of its sexual and torturous imagery, it takes its place as the most controversial video to ever make it to MTV. Then there is the Perfect Drug, a beautiful and wonderful video that makes me yearn for film school. The video is so mysterious and pretty, you can't help but rewind it again and again. This set is a must for any NIN fan. Don't be without it!",1396569600,,2160,4.4847715736040605
8650785,4,B00JH1WSEO,"This is a great DVD set... unless you pay very well attention to detail you wouldn't even be able to tell this is a bootleg. Who ever is making them is doing an EXCELLENT job! I do believe an artist should be supported by their fans, but I also believe that art isn't something you should have to pay for either.... get what you can, how you can ;) But if you're a NIN fan, GET THIS DVD... it's worth it.

I got halo 00-28... hit me up for the hook up!",1258675200,,452,3.9130434782608696

Not only did it exceed my expectations, The Sound as well as picture quality Is way better than the Original Halo 12 on VHS. This is a must have!!!!! Thank you guys again very much You ROCK!!!",1233100800,,294,4.462962962962963
