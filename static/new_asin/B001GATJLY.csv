8683272,4,B001GATJLY,"I own a ton of snowboard / ski films, and am mostly into big mountain riding.  I really enjoyed this film.  It is a good introduction to the whole world of hiking into lines and riding them.  I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it lacked that something extra.  I don't expect this lower budget film to be on par with TGR's Deeper, but I was hoping for a few steeper / riskier lines.  That minor problem also serves as something cool in this film, most of the lines done seem ridable by most good snowboarders / skiers, whereas bigger films just have lines that are too exposed / too steep for the common man.",1265587200,,613,4.205128205128205
