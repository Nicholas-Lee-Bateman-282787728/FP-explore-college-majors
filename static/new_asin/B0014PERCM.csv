8256226,5,B0014PERCM,"I don't normally write reviews, but I just have to say I really enjoyed this video. I like the fact that there's cardio, strength, and core work all in one workout. I also like the fact that I can choose to do any of the sections by themself too if I'm short on time or would like to combine it with something else. I hope that Sarah makes more DVDs. It's nice to have a different face to look at when exercising (besides the regular instructors).",1214956800,5,447,4.209302325581396
8256227,3,B0014PERCM,"Well i have to tell you that this workout contains a great background scenario and honestly this workout is good for when you don't want to do high impact exercise and want to workout anyway,it makes sweat and gives you a good core workout,you can choose your own workouts when you are short in time.she is a very gentle instructor,not JILLIAN MICHAELS TYPE!!!",1209686400,5,360,4.73015873015873
