5462586,5,B00AO1RKFS,This was the culmination of a very fine series.  We will miss Tom and Joyce Barnaby and all the rest of the characters we've come to love over the years.  It's a well done show.,1367366400,19,177,4.0285714285714285
5462587,4,B00AO1RKFS,"I was unsure how the program would be without the original Barnaby, but I think they did a very good job with the new programs, and look forward to seeing more.",1367280000,5,160,4.193548387096774
5462588,5,B00AO1RKFS,"I started watching this show on A&E, then I started buying the DVDs.  This is one of the best written and acted mystery shows on British television.  You can't afford to turn away once the show starts or you may miss something relavant.  I have the entire series up to the moment Barnaby retires.  It was bittersweet, but I think his cousin, DCI Barnaby, will fill a little of the void left by John Nettles and his television family.",1367193600,28,433,4.443037974683544
5462589,5,B00AO1RKFS,I'm very much enjoying this set and the cross over to the new Barnaby.  It's a good lead in to Neil Dudgeon whom I also enjoy.  Midsomer has been left in good hands. Patricia,1366934400,12,174,4.088235294117647
5462590,5,B00AO1RKFS,I am a great fan of British mysteries. I think John Nettles who plays Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby is a great actor and I will miss him when he retires.,1366934400,7,151,4.066666666666666
5462591,4,B00AO1RKFS,"My wife and I are big fans of anything British detective series. Midsomer is one of the best. It deals not only in mystery and murder, but Tom Barnaby actually has a life outside of his work. He has a wife, daughter and various characters who inhabit his rural type community. Sgt Troy his assistant adds some youth and a different view point on the current investigation and life in general. Along with the sometime brutal murders there is also added some humor that meets the occasion.  A great series would have given this set five stars, but no closed caption for my old ears. Still for some reason they speak clearer then on most British series and I can understand them. Highly recommend for all Britsh detective enthusiasts.",1366761600,21,731,4.666666666666667
5462592,5,B00AO1RKFS,Anyone who has enjoyed the series Midsomer Murders will thoroughly like his last cases.  They have a few new twists and a few last insights into who Barnaby the man is!,1366156800,3,168,4.419354838709677
5462593,5,B00AO1RKFS,"HAVE THE ORGINIAL SETS, BUT HAVE WATCHED THEM SO MANY TIMES.  THESE SETS ARE A BACKUP FOR TOM BARNABY'S CASES.",1366070400,,110,4.5
5462594,5,B00AO1RKFS,"Murder- rampant & mystifyingly delicious. DCI Barnaby (John Nettles) has taken on the fictional Midsomer County murder abundance since 1997 and this set is his final feature-length murder stories. But you'll be booking a flight to London (filming done in rural hamlets just outside London) to have tea with scones in the green of some village, excitedly waiting for the next bludgeoning murder. Prev sets:17 to 20. All good.

Wife Joyce (Jane Wymark), great cook, companion, and in charge of lightening the story with homespun gentleness. Barnaby's dialogue/murder solving companion adds comedy. Show guest stars make this a fresh dynamic series each time. With every episode, predicting Who Dun It? is impossible. Just try!

Multiple murders in every episode are a trademark, intended from the very beginning, by the writers/producers to make Midsomer Murders unique. And no swearing, but plenty of good ""Midsomer family"" murder mystery--the murder almost never seen, just the moments up to the kill, and then of course the body. Part of the humor is the excessive number of murders in a lovely rural/village setting that could count dastardly deaths per sq. ft. Delightful setting, sets, scenic environment is enticing.

* The Dogleg Murders: A player murdered on the golf course where Barnaby & Jones discover a bevy of crime.
* The Black Book: Auction of discovered masterpiece by a Midsomer painter is the catalyst for a series of murders.
* Secrets and Spies: Barnaby's past as a secret agent comes into play when another former agent is murdered.
* The Glitch: Threat by a university fellow to reveal a glitch in a new software program mistakenly caused the hit and run killing.
* Small Mercies: Gulliver (corpse) comes to a small English village, tied to the earth, but stabbed to death. One Midsomer murder's never enough. Evidence, secrets go back decades.
* The Creeper: Chief's house robbed by a person named Creeper. Later he pays CI Barnaby's home a visit as well.
* The Great and the Good: Until a man is found murdered in her garden, a teacher of town is not taken seriously about her constant suggestions of someone entering her house. Barnaby's investigates find interesting items
* The Made-to-Measure Murders: Death of a tailor, just to begin things.
* The Sword of Guillaume: The future Midsomer Murder investigator head (Neil Dudgeon) is seen working along side DCI Tom Barnaby.
* Blood on the Saddle: If it sounds a bit ""Wild West""-like, it is.
* The Silent Land: Joyce is involved well beyond her comfort zone.
* Master Class: A Barnaby dj vu mystery suicide-drowning and baby abandonment with a musical twist.
* The Noble Art: Does the title refer to boxing or all of the local adulterous activity, gender mix, in the small community? Results is numerous murders.
* Not in My Back Yard: New development plans have supporters, participants, opposition, everything but apathy, --a recipe for community strife & murder.
* Fit For Murder: Death in a health spa may be murder, Barnaby at the scene. Episode best known as the final episode with John Nettles.

All episodes DO have SDH subtitles as an option.",1359331200,60,3127,4.9732313575525815

5462597,5,B00AO1RKFS,My sister and I enjoy the Midsomer Murders series. It has become a Sunday afternoon tradition with us - we both like them very much. I have yet to see any without John Nettles playing the lead as Tom Barnaby. It was well worth the cost of the CDs; it's great entertainment. This set was ordered through Amazon and the private company used sent them in very good condition - as promised.,1497225600,,386,4.375

I watched the first series after Tom's  retirement and even with Jason Hughes in it, it isn't the same.",1494028800,5,279,4.411764705882353
5462601,5,B00AO1RKFS,"As a long time Midsomer Murders fan, I had been looking for a good British series. The entireity of the series is exceptionally good and entertaining. New characters are introduced, and it did not take long to welcome them. In fact, Every well known English actor has appeared at least once in this series. It made the last of the series a little more exciting. I was given this series from a pal in the UK

John Nettles is Barnaby and Daniel Casey is his DS. Barnaby is thinking if retiring. He is young with city experience and wonders if country life will suit him. However, he is more than willing to give it a try. Badgers Drift is the scene, and there seem to be more murders than necessary. The mysteries and murders continue. We meet some of the families of all involved.  All of the episodes are well done and entertaining. And the last episode, well..wait and see.

Alas the subtitle means just what it says. As always each episode in the set has an interesting plot with a nice balance between the mystery that has to be solved and insights into the life of the man who must solve it. Although the last episode leaves the series in the hands of another Inspector Barnaby, he will have to be very good to fill John Nettles shoes.",1449878400,7,504,4.315789473684211

And she was a great model for older women with all the wonderful activities she would participate  in and often get Tom to join in with her!!! I so wanted to see Cully's starring roles in her theater productions and perhaps become a mother, too!!! :) Then, Tom!!!!:) What can I say??? I have lost an intelligent, fun-loving, persistent sleuth, who so reminded me of Sherlock Holmes, but Tom is so much more down-to-earth.  Gosh, I am tearful writing this... Maybe there could be a special when the family comes to visit cousin Barnaby and we could see everyone again?????  You all have a place in my heart!!!! :)",1426118400,,971,4.342541436464089

5462666,5,B00AO1RKFS,"Midsomer Murders has been a favorite series of mine,for a very long time. I purchased this collection with a bit of regret,knowing as the title states it was Tom Barnaby's last cases. This completed my collection as I knew that Midsomer Murders would not be the same for me without Tom and Joyce and Cully, who had nearly become members of my family. The collection of episodes, was  as enjoyable as ever, with great stories and exceptional character actors. The final episode, with Tom's retirement ,was exceptionally well written and the conclusion realistic. I am so pleased that I have completed the 80+ episodes, but must admit that John Barnaby,Tom's cousin, lacks the charm and humor of the of the John Nettles performances. This is a great final tribute for a wonderful, charming fictional character, who lives in  one of the loveliest  parts of England.

5462676,5,B00AO1RKFS,"As a rule murder mysteries are among my favorite t.v. shows, so when I was first introduced to ""Midsomer Murders"" some 8 years ago, I thought they were rather interesting.  Later I found almost the whole series in the local library and watched all that they had.  The acting is wonderful, and the interaction of the detectives provides humor which can be missed if one is  not paying attention.  Tom Barnaby's family is also a good part of the show as well as the wonderful scenery and music.  I was so pleased to find this large collection on sale as I owned only one small set before.  I have also recently bought other series, so I have not watched all of the last cases of Tom Barnaby, but I have really appreciated the ones I have watched.  Fans of British mysteries are most likely to enjoy this set immensely.",1399593600,,816,4.436241610738255
5462677,5,B00AO1RKFS,It's too bad that we don't have something like Midsomer Murders here in the US.  The series started in 1997 and is still continuing even though one would think they would run out of bodies.  Barnaby is a most charming detective as well as odd because he is happily married.  Not only the plots are superb but the English countryside is gloriously yummy.,1399593600,,353,4.571428571428571

5462679,5,B00AO1RKFS,FUN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY AND EVERYONE FEELS GOOD AT THE END.  THE BRITISH ACCENT IS NOT SO STRONG THAT WE CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT AND IT MOVES ALONG AT A GREAT PACE.

After these, his brother will take over, & I will be sad to see this guy go! He has a droll sense of humor & these last cases are truly weird! Like Barnaby says, these little towns are full of murder & no place to retire to in old age! I will add this to my other DVD's from this series.
