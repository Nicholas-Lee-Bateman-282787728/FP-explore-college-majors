8737570,4,B016YQEQMQ,"I saw this in theaters and knew right away I wanted to own it when it came out.  It was a lot like the first one, but not quite as good as the original, which was a classic.  The new dinosaurs it adds to the mix are all really cool and really add to the whole appeal of the movie.  I really liked Chris Pratt's character the most.  The Indominus, the raptors, and Pratt are what totally make the movie what it is.  The plot is a nice shout out to the original as well.  There's high intensity scenes as well as scenes with quite a bit of humor and intelligence.  This is definitely the best sequel to the first movie, because the plot is a lot better than the 2nd and 3rd.  The youngest boy was much more annoying than Lexi in the first movie, and she was almost impossible to tolerate.  I really liked the special effects in this movie as well.  It really shows how far we have come since the 90s.  If you like dinosaurs, you'll love this movie.  It's an adventure and it's nearly impossible to not enjoy the ride.  It is definitely one of the better movies I have seen in recent years.  It is absolutely engrossing and just fun to watch, but also has a great story to go with the action, which is usually missing in a lot of action movies today.",1445731200,,1247,4.141666666666667
