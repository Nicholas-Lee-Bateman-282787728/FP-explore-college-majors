8694385,5,B00R71YIK8,"This famous concert, recorded in Japan in 1994 and as a combined NHK and Euroarts combined venture, has achieved something of a cult status and this issue is the third outing at the very least. The first issue was marketed by TDK and that was later followed by a version from Arthaus. This Euroarts edition is identical in content but there are minor differences which will probably only be apparent under the most revealing playback conditions.  (I believe there has also been a Kultur version which has not come my way).

The TDK version, although sounding well and with excellent camera work and definition, was slightly lacking in colour definition  a matter of production choices concerning the exposure levels possible in order to bring out shadow detail. This was the main difference noticeable with the later Arthaus version which was markedly darker in colour range. The inevitably lost some of the shadow detail visible in the TDK version. The sound was identical however.

The new Euroarts version being considered here falls somewhere between the two and is arguably the best compromise as regards shadow detail and depth of colour. What is remarkable in all three is the technical excellence achieved by the Japanese recording engineers in 1994 delivering genuine 16.9 picture format with true DTS and DD surround sound, all of HD clarity. This was 5 years at least before European recordings became HD.

As regards sound, although the recording has not been re-mastered (as there clearly was no need), the new Euroarts copy benefits by being put onto disc at a slightly higher playback level than either TDK or Arthaus.  Even so, adding about 3 DB extra playback level makes the most of the recording, at which point the impact of all sections of the orchestra and especially the timpani and bass drum is vividly enhanced, even startling at times.

All three performances are remarkable. The opening Mussorgsky is the original Bare Mountain which is far more darkly effective than the truncated Rimsky Korsakov arrangement. That is so much of a re-arrangement as to be almost unrecognisable when compared with the original as heard here. The Firebird second suite from 1919 is also vividly caught and is more exciting and involving than the later Lucerne version, good though that is.

The jewel of this undoubted crown of the BPO live recordings is the Tchaikovsky fifth symphony which achieves a sense of excitement, thrill and sheer joy that is quite remarkable and probably unrepeatable. The building emotional roller-coaster is appropriately caught by the camera crew who are able to show expressions of personal and shared joy lighting up the faces of players as the culmination to the final movement is approached. The cheering crowd cannot wait for the final chord to die away before letting their enthusiasm be heard. They must have realised that they had just witnessed a remarkable concert.

If ever there was a case for a Blu-ray edition of a concert, then this has to be it. In the meantime this Euroarts version is the best of the three DVD issues made to date, if only by the merest whisker. Those happy with their previous TDK and Arthaus versions should remain happy. Those without any of the versions ought to rectify the omission without delay and go straight for this Euroarts version.

This is arguably one of the very best Abbado live concerts and has been given an excellent recording. A very special disc.",1429833600,,3443,4.951473136915078
