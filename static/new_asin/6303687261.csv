699412,4,6303687261,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.  ""Tecumseh"" taught us about the history of our nation through the Native's standpoint. The Shawnee tribe was the movies' main focus and their stuggle to keep their land.  If  you like war and fighting then you will enjoy this movie for all of it's  battles.  But, if you are like me and like a good story plot and a  tear-jerker you will enjoy ""Tecumseh"" as well.  This movie will  appeal to all types of movie watchers so be sure to watch it.",955065600,5,481,4.386363636363637
699413,4,6303687261,"This is a pretty good movie about indian wars.  It is pretty factual and i think that it is really interesting.  It has a lot of war scenes that is really interesting.  It also has some love scenes for the little ladies  (nothing graphic).  The movie followed a real storyline, which made it even  more interesting.  I would recomend watching it because it has a really  good ending and it really keeps you interested in it.  If you like  indian movies or war movies then i diffently recomend that you watch this  movie.  It has some really good and pretty graphic war scenes.  It would be  a good movie to watch with your friends or your family.  I think that you  would diffinently like to watch this movie.",955065600,2,709,4.421875

7852492,5,6303687261,"One of the more civilized men who deserved the good legend history has given him I was really quite pleased seeing this film about this man. It has many of the Hollywood mistakes but what film doesn't when it comes to historical figures.

I loved that it showed his father was mixed blooded.

I loved the way it showed him in relationship with his family. I loved the costuming and the setting of the villages. I thought the fight scenes were extremely well done.

I was really pleased with the way they used coloring to show the Indians who were free as filled with color while those who have given in have become dark and depressed falling into drunkenness and despair with children of mixed blood wandering like ghosts between the huts.  But as the old chief who was once so fierce points out There Comes a time when the cries of widows take over.

Tecumseh resisted that to the death all his life. When he died so did his dream.

The only thing I wish the film had contained was the Witch Hunting he and his followers instigated against people in their own tribes whom they wished to eliminate much as was the case in Salem for even though it is the dark half of the man it is none the less a part of him. Just as his brighter more civilised behavior makes him worthy of our admiration.",1144800000,5,1290,4.354166666666667

7852494,5,6303687261,"As an educator, I strongly recommed the film Tecumseh: The Last Warrior because it is one of its kind in bringing into action the cultural beliefs and way of life of Native American groups such as the Shawnee, who were affected by the clash of cultures and seizure of their ancestoral lands by whites.  I use the film as a reward for the students who have studied federal policies toward the Native Americans including those of our past presidents and view points of Native Americans such as Tecumseh, who fought hard to drive the whites out of their lands in the Ohio, Illinois, and other present day states that were organized under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.  Organized under Tecumseh, native groups resisted to further white expansion and fought hard to preserve their way of life.  This film is accurate in depicting Native American stuggles and sufferings and I truly recommend it.",1020556800,14,893,4.8618421052631575
7852495,4,6303687261,"I was excited when I saw this TV adaptation of James Alexander Thom's historical novel ""Panther in the Sky"". I have had an avid interest in American frontier history and the indian wars of the Old Northwest. The story of Tecumseh and his indian confederacy is one of great triumph and tragedy for the last of the tribes east of the Missisiippi river in the early 19th century. It is amazing to me how much we are NOT taught about the very bloody conflicts between the native tribes and white settlers that took place in the areas that make up modern-day Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Tecumseh was considered by many, indian and white alike, to be the greatest native resistance leader of all time. While I was pleased with many aspects of this movie, I was disappointed in several historical errors. I understand that when adapting history to film it is neccessary to fudge some things for dramatic intensity, but it can be annoying nonetheless. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie about a great leader.",989366400,21,1054,4.702702702702703
7852496,5,6303687261,"I recommend this movie to everyone. It really focuses on every little detail of Tecumseh's life. It takes you back into time and allows you to see how the Shawnee people lived and what they went through with the  whites, first hand. It tells the story of the legend we know as Tecumseh  perfectly. It is a must see for everyone!",963619200,9,328,4.360655737704918
