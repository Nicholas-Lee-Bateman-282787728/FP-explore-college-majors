7166494,5,B00X8RONG4,"This should have been the first season of Sgt. Bilko (not the Steve Martin movie) show starring Phil Silvers.  But the folks at Paramount got cold feet about releasing Bilko with season sets. So what we're left with as an introduction is a sampler of 21 episodes from the four seasons (there were 142 episodes made). Seeing how you rarely catch Phil Silvers on TV anymore, it's still important to have in the collection next to the Hogan's Heroes boxsets. Although you could also put this next to the Beach Party films since it features that man who would go on to become Eric Von Zipper.  And don't forget Phil's animated tribute ""Top Cat.""

the bonus elements do have me excited.

Thanks to the talents of  Phil Silvers, Paul Ford (Col Hall) and Harvey Lembeck (Bilko's sidekick) this never gets old.  The ""Harry Speakup"" episode, in which a chimp is drafted into the Army is still hilarious.

7166536,5,B00X8RONG4,"SGT. BILKO/THE PHIL SILVERS SHOW: There was never another TV series remotely like BILKO, even though several attempts, from MCHALE'S NAVY and F TROOP to cartoon connivers TOP CAT and HOKEY WOLF, were launched in its aftermath, none approaching a sliver of its greatness. PHIL SILVER's ultimate wheeler-dealer SGT. ERNIE BILKO was the loudest, most memorable and funniest personality to ever fleece an Army post, his relentless rat-a-tat machine gun delivery totalling more words per minute than any actor in sitcom history. He  sweet-talked, double-talked, and out-talked everyone in his wake, from PAUL FORD's perpetually hornswaggled COLONEL HALL on down to his own rag-tag platoon, notably MAURICE GOSFIELD's putty-faced PRIVATE DOBERMAN (who repeated the role as the voice of TOP CAT's fave flunkie BENNY). Character actors ALLAN MELVIN and HARVEY LEMBECK aided their superior in all manner of get-rick-quick shenanigans from the ""Little Las Vegas"" shangri-la known as FORT BAXTER, KANSAS...mink farms, pigeon races, glow in the dark crap games...nothing seemed beyond BILKO's sticky grasp. Audiences never tired of the con, as SILVERS played the same basic schemer throughout the rest of his career, including memorable guest turns in IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD, THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND. Even as he picked your pocket, beneath that gruff exterior lurked a heart of (what else?) ""pure gold"".

This is a great way to package Bilko rather than simply issuing all of the episodes.

Someone Else Wrote
This should have been the first season of Sgt. Bilko (not the Steve Martin movie) show starring Phil Silvers. But the folks at Paramount got cold feet about releasing Bilko with season sets. So what we're left with as an introduction is a sampler of 21 episodes from the four seasons (there were 142 episodes made).

From me to all of these DVD Companies
I DON'T do Best Ofs, Volumes, TV Shows MUST be COMPLETE and UNCUT, Just because it says COMPLETE doesn't mean it's UNCUT. See ALL 4 Seasons of ALF, Father of the Pride, Season 1 of Rosanne, ALL 5 Seasons of Two and a Half Men-One of the season 1 episodes was only 18:30.

It's either a Complete UnCut Season or i keep my money
Extras for me are Optional and NO big deal
The Show is pure Brilliance, The 2 Stars are for this Crummy 21 episode set.
Season 1 had 34 episodes
At least other companies know how to do it.",1259625600,7,992,4.294117647058823
7166542,4,B00X8RONG4,I enjoyed this show as a kid. It was a favorite for the family back in the 50's. I had never seen re-runs and what a pleasant surprise to see it again in very good quality. It is fun to escape all of the things that go along with todays society and the Phil Silvers show has all that it takes to go back to the days of innocence. Fast moving kind of silly but most enjoyable.,1258070400,,375,3.883116883116883
7166543,4,B00X8RONG4,Compared to the shows on all the available TV channels any given afternoon or evening -- we'd rather watch funny old stuff - movies and TV shows made before all the sex and violence and low morals and values.  Maybe some of the stuff is politically incorrect these days -- but funny is funny - even in black and white.,1231632000,3,318,4.3
7166544,5,B00X8RONG4,IT MAY BE 50 YEARS SINCE BILKO GRACED THE T.V. SCREENS. IT HAS LOST NONE OF IT'S MAGIC OVER THE YEARS. GIVES ANY MODERN AMERICAN COMEDY A RUN FOR IT'S MONEY. WHENEVER GREAT AMERICAN SITCOMS ARE TALKED OF BILKO IS HARDLY EVER MENTIONED SADLY.,1214524800,3,241,4.5
7166549,5,B00X8RONG4,"Starts a tad slow, but then gets hilarious.  If you like shows from the Golden Age of TV, get this.  Is there anybody who was simply funnier than Phil Silvers?  The man was funny, period.  He knew how to make people laugh, especially where others would have failed.  And if you like old TV, then you'll be happy to see many folks who went on to greater fame elsewhere.

Oh, I'm not somebody who considers himself to be all that old.  I'm in my mid-40's, but I like old TV and movies.  Back then the story and the characters made you laugh, the writers actually wrote, and the actors acted.  There was no need for special effects or bathroom/bedroom humor.  They were funny without that stuff.",1214179200,,692,4.420634920634921

This 50th anniversary package is outstanding value. Not only have a great selection of episodes been included with personal favourites, ""The Twitch"" and ""The Court Martial"", but there is an endless package of extras which recapture the magic of these relatively early days of television.  Highlights are Phil Silvers with the immortal Jack Benny on Dick Cavett's talk show, the last televised interview with Silvers in 1987 and some great commentaries on a few of the episodes.

The video quality is great and each episode is over 25 minutes long, unlike shows you see in reruns today which are edited for commercials.

What better sales course than ""The Empty Store"" ??

Years ago I taped virtually every episode when it was broadcast as a marathon on ""T.V. Land"". I should have gone through and reviewed each episode at the time. I have misplaced many of those recordings for various reasons but let me say for the record that many of the shows were less than stellar. There are about 30 of the 142 shows that were true gems. Another 30-40 were very good, the remainder were just o.k. Of course an O.K. Bilko Show was still more entertaining than most of the junk on t.v. today. Remember the talent pool was more rich in the old days. There were usually only three channels on television in the 50's!

7166566,5,B00X8RONG4,"i bought the bilko dvds as a present for my sister. when we were children (both born in the late 70s), our grandparents would watch us when our mother was still at work. our grandfather loved phil silvers so at a very early age  we developed a very broad sense of humor. all we had left of those days are my grandfather's tapes (and he was not very technically inclined, commercials edited, commercials not edited, part of the episode missing) and our constant re-enacting various scenes. this dvd set is priceless to any fan. while it doesn't have all the great episodes, it has plenty of the good ones (including bivouac) and others yet that i never even saw. if you love to laugh and have never seen the phil silvers show this is a must have. it is impossible to not think his sly wheeling and dealing (that invariably never accomplishes his desired result) is hilarious.",1167955200,4,874,4.56687898089172

7166579,4,B00X8RONG4,"In one of those good news-bad news scenarios, the real Sergeant Bilko - the original Phil Silvers Show - has finally made it onto DVD in time for its 50th anniversary, but Paramount have definitely erred on the side of caution with the treatment.

Not that Sergeant Bilko - The Phil Silvers Show 50th Anniversary Edition isn't a good presentation: it is, with more extras than you could realistically expect from a show this old, including the unseen 33-minute pilot episode when the show was still going to be called You'll Never Get Rich, vintage interviews, audio commentaries (including one by George Kennedy, who began his screen career as the army's advisor and sometime extra on the show) and much, much more. But rather than opting for a season-by-season release, Paramount have gone for a 'Best of' three-disc set. With a show as strong as Bilko, that ensures that a lot of great episodes are missing (including one of the greatest, The Empty Store, as well as Mardi Gras, Hollywood, The Rest Cure, Bilko and the Beast, The Song of the Motor Pool and Bilko's Perfect Day), and, even worse, it also means that this is probably all we'll ever get. And boycotting this release will only drive sales figures down even further until the chance of a full release is even more remote.

It's a good overview of the show from first to last episode, and some of the episdes are 100%-proof classics, like The Twitch (where Bilko runs a nationwide book on how many times a lecturer brought in to stop the men from gambling will compulsively twitch), The Court Martial (the one where a chimp on rollerskates is inducted into the army as Private Harry Speakup, coming third in the intelligence test in the process!) and The Eating Contest. But it just ain't nearly enough for a show with such a consistent standard of great writing, outrageously anarchic satire and some brilliant improvisation from Phil Silvers... More, please, and soon - that's an order!",1162857600,23,1952,4.789317507418398
7166580,5,B00X8RONG4,"When I was a kid, my folks wanted us all settled down when Sergeant Bilko came onto the TV -- and now, half a century later, I understand why.  The wit moves fast and furiously, taking aim at pretense in all directions, and not just within the military, but within bureaucracies of all kinds that began to pervade American life during the '50's when Phil Silvers' act played. It takes a rare brilliance and vision to produce belly laughs 50 years later, and keep my eye on the screen and my hand off of the remote control.  Consider this set for yourself and as a gift for others.  Especially look for the spot on Disk 1 when Phil takes a pop at Dick Cavett while a guest on his talk show.",1161907200,5,689,4.244274809160306
7166581,5,B00X8RONG4,"The early 1950's saw a lot of great comedy TV shows (besides Lucy) that really had audiences begging for more. As my family laughed and applauded the antics of Joan Davis, Jackie Gleason, Phil Silvers and others, I always looked on in wonderment.  That's all a toddler can do: enjoy the opening title theme music, and then watch the show, understanding none of it and not getting a single joke.

A lot of these shows are on DVD now and I'm getting a chance to go back and see what all the fun was about. Watching the Phil Silvers Show, I now realize what I was missing. This show rox!

Dear Paramount/CBS video, Your 3-disc set of Sgt. Bilko is great; the sound and picture are superb and the extras are fun Fun FUN! So THIS is the kind of great quality film you have languishing in your vaults? And you're just letting it SIT there? For shame! I promise you, if you release all the shows in boxed sets, one season at a time, I won't be able to order them FAST enough. And believe me, I'm not the only one who feels that way!",1158883200,24,1025,4.219387755102041
7166582,5,B00X8RONG4,"Phil Silvers had the comic timing and years of vaudeville experience to make Bilko's absurd, fast talk con games brilliantly funny...and let's not forget that trademark leer.

Of course Silvers had good comedic talent in Paul Ford (Col. John T. Hall)and Joe. E. Ross (Mess Sgt. Rupert 'chipped-beef-on-toast-Bilko-and-whaddaya-want?) Ritzik to act as great fall guys. And after all, Fort Baxter, Kansas was too far from any cold war hot spot for Bilko's tricks to attract any serious attention from the brass. Bilko would do anything to make money.

Still Ernie Bilko could be serious, like the time he had to make a training training-film on motor repairs. Bilko could see that the dry narrative would bore the enlisted men to tears and the message would be lost, so he re-wrote the film as a pantomine with his soldiers personifying engine parts and problems; Dobermann was ""Mr. Carbon"".

Col. Hall was furious with the film until his wife said ""Dear I didn't realize that carbon built up on spark-plugs if you didn't clean them with high pressure air.""  Hall was undercut when he realized that Bilko had made the message so simple that even she could understand it!

Sgt. Bilko was suprisingly escapist for a show about the army in the 1950s, it made no reference to the red scare and the more right-wingers may have thought Bilko subversive. Compare Silvers to TV's  Superman. Here was the slick, fast talking Sargeant more interested in grafting the quick buck and outwitting his hapless Commanding Officer, i.e making fools of army brass, than defending democracy.
I can't imagine Bilko standing square jawed, arms resolutely folded before the American flag; ready to fight for truth justice and the American way!

Bilko has to be on  A.B.C. Australia; along with Mr. Ed and My Favorite Martian, commercial stations can't handle too much imagination.",1156896000,7,1856,5.003246753246753

The creation of Nat Hiken, and starring the incomparable Phil Silvers and a cast of some of the greatest names in showbiz, this series is 50 years old.

7166598,5,B00X8RONG4,I bought Sgt. Bilko as a Father's Day present for it was my dad's favorite show in the early fifties.  He always talked about it as I was growing up and now at 32 I was happy to sit down with him a finally see an episode.  I loved it.  Phil Silvers is funny and witty.  I really was surprised that after all the years it is still enjoyable to watch and doesn't seem dated.  I thought it was better than a lot of the sit com reruns of my generation.,1151452800,11,448,3.879120879120879
7166599,4,B00X8RONG4,"I guess if you're a fan of old black & white TV shows you're gonna have to go through this, but ""You'll Never Get Rich"" was one of the biggest TV hits of the 50s, every bit as big as ""the Honeymooners"" or ""I Love Lucy"", but the owners of the show (I guess that's CBS video) don't feel secure in offering a complete run without first putting out this sampler to see how Sgt. Bilko will sell.

I think as far as it goes, it's a great set;  but even as a sampler there aren't enough episodes--only 18. The selections are uniformly good--every show on here is a gem, but I think there should have been at least 30-36 programs offered in this, as a ""best of"" set.

The extras are also neat.  My biggest complaint is that my two all time favorite episodes ain't here: the one with THE BEAST, featuring the famous HARVEY from the Honeymooners as a brash bully who comes new to Ft. Baxter and pushes his way into Bilko's enterprises; and the episode where Col. Hall hires a professional card shark to masquerade as an ordinary soldier and beat Bilko at his own game (with hilarious consequences). Hopefully these will be in the next ""sample"" set, or, better yet,  CBS will com e out with a complete season-by-season Bilko.

In the mean time, this is the best we have and it ain't bad. I would also encourage all Bilko fans to buy it as this may show CBS that a complete Bilko would be a profitable offering. The idea that F-Troop, an amusing show, but a second-rate knock-off of Bilko, is being offered complete, but Bilko ain't, is a travesty.",1150329600,42,1536,4.353146853146853
7166600,5,B00X8RONG4,"I received this set from Amazon yesterday and spent most of the evening going through the three discs. The transfers are terrific. There is not a speck, scratch or splice on any of the episodes that I watched.

From a TV history perspective, the ""lost"" pilot was very interesting. It is the same story as the first episode of the series. The pilot, however, was shot electronically with switched cameras and recorded on 16mm kinescope film. The episode was practically identical to the pilot--with some of the characters played by different actors. Notably, in the pilot Corporal Henshaw--Allan Melvin in the actual series--is played by Jack Warden. Paul Ford is not in it and the chaplain is played by Harry Clark who was Sgt. Stanley Sowicki in the series. The lost pilot is a great find and its inclusion in this set is a real treat.

Also remarkable were the cigarette commercials done by members of the cast in character. There is a nice disclaimer before they are shown on the disc asking viewers not to smoke.

Another neat extra is a scene from an episode performed live on the Ed Sullivan Show. This aired on the Sunday before the series began its Tuesday night run on CBS. Paul Ford blows a line (saying ""Bilko"" instead of ""bivouac"") but being the real pros they all were, nobody misses a beat and the show goes on.

Allan Melvin introduces each episode and does an optional commentary over the first one. From the warmth in his voice and from what he chooses to remark upon a viewer can tell that he remembers what went on 51 years ago with great affection. George Kennedy also does an optional episode commentary. Phil Silvers explains to Dick Cavett in another extra that Kennedy was assigned as an Army officer to the show as a technical advisor. Silvers told him to get a Screen Actors Guild card and the rest is history.

All of the series episodes were filmed in New York City, first filmed at 205 East 67th Street. This was a former Dumont television studio at what is now the location of Fox's channel 5 in New York. It was later filmed at Himan Brown's Production Center at 221 West 26th Street, today's Chelsea Studios. Allan Melvin, who passed away in January 2008, says they rehearsed in a hall over Lindy's bar and restaurant in Times Square. (Himan Brown passed away on June 4, 2010, at the age of 99. He was remembered for his radio dramas, among them Grand Central Station, the Inner Sanctum and The Thin Man. According to his obituary in the New York Times, Hi Brown recalled producing or participating in more than 30,000 radio programs.)",1149724800,2,2567,4.620614035087719
7166601,5,B00X8RONG4,"An early landmark in television comedy makes its DVD bow. The ""Sgt. Bilko"" set features 18 classic shows from the 1955-59 series, with a wealth of extras thrown in for good measure. Phil Silvers was at the top of his game in this timeless vehicle - surrounded by a terrific supporting cast (including Paul Ford, Harvey Lembeck, Allan Melvin and the inimitable Maurice Gosfield). Hopefully, more Bilko episodes will be released in the not-too-distant future.",1149552000,11,457,5.1066666666666665
7166602,5,B00X8RONG4,"Look, funny is funny.  These gems from a fondly cherished show from my childhood are still great all these 50+ years later.  With only a slight reference to topicality, these shows were written to be laugh-out-loud funny (which they are, more often than not) and were performed by actor/comedians who came up through nightclubs & Burlesque and knew both timing and attitude.

Phil Silvers was a master at fast-paced delivery and his timing is exquisite.  His conniving MSgt Ernie Bilko is such a classic character he has become an archetype.  (I knew two MSgts in Germany that really did have their own dice table in their barracks rooms and ran a 24/7 poker casino and could get you literally ANYTHING, for a price.)

Matching Phil Silvers, and in his own way just as funny, is Paul Ford's befuddled Col. Hall.  His slow, often bewildered delivery is the perfect foil to Silver's staccato riffs.  Ford often has the killer line, and the show wouldn't have been the same without him.

Likewise the supporting cast of Bilko's worshipful Cpls Henshaw and Barbella, and the motley, misfit platoon of losers (Zimmerman, Papperelli, and the inimitable Doberman) are all first rate, and contribute their comedic gifts in various episodes. And then there is (in the later shows) Joe E. Ross's great Mess Sgt Ritzik and his harridan of a wife.  Unfortunately they are only in a couple of episodes here, but I recall many of the funniest in the series involved Grover & Ritzik (""I knew it!"") forever getting skinned by Bilko while Ritzik's wife had a fit and fell through it.

The guest character actors (Fred Gwynne, Alan Alda, Dick Van Dyke, Larry Storch, Murray Hamilton etc.) often went on to greater glory.  Dick Van Dyke's episode is especially good, and I was hoping the Fred Gwynne episode was where he had ""Boids in his head"" from memorizing a bird book while on duty in some remote outpost and Bilko gets him on a quiz show, but this one is when he was ""The Stomach""... it's pretty good too.  And the induction and Courts Martial of private Harry Speakup (the chimp) is absolutely hysterical.

From the occasional muffed line, you can tell these shows were filmed as if in live performance, and the professionalism of the cast is everywhere present.  This is comedy written simply for the joy of laughing at human foibles as seen by the elaborate and usually backfiring schemes of a master con-man and the shlubs around him.  Funny is funny, and these are all that.",1149033600,16,2466,4.753521126760563
7166603,4,B00X8RONG4,"""You'll never get Rich"",the original title which shortly became just the ""Phil Silvers Show"",goes down in TV history as one of the all time best.

Phil Silvers himself came right out of vaudeville,worked on Broadway,in radio and went into films in the 40s. Speaking of radio there is a CD you might want to look for of Phil Silvers appearing on The Kraft Music Hall of Dec. 16th/43,on the Laserlight label. The host was Bing Crosby and they do a nice little verbal routine together. Phil was on to tout his latest flick 'Four Jills and a Jeep'.The CD is part of Bings' WW2 Radio broadcast series.

Phil was a journeyman actor working wherever and whenever he could. Phil even had some minor sucess as a tunesmith taking co-writing credit in Frank Sinatras' hit ""Nancy(with the smiling face)"".

Movie,clubs,radio,Broadway and TV appearances kept him busy into the mid 50s when TV writer Nat Hiken and Phil got together to create one of TVs most beloved and memorable characters M/Sgt. E.T.Bilko. Phil surrounded himself with alot of great and talented second bananas that Phils' character could bounce his frenetic and high energy off of. The show didn't take long to fall into the good graces of TV viewers everywhere and it went on to win a succession of Emmys after just its' first year on. They just couldn't get enough of Bilkos' constant brain storms and/or scheming and wondered who he was going to pull one over on next,be it the enlisted men,his peers or his superiors. But Bilko was loyal and if one of his friends needed his help or had been wronged by whomever,he was there with the perfect idea to extracate them out of their predicament. He was always trying to stay one step ahead of either army rules,the chaplain,visiting brass or committees and especially the camp commander Colonel Hall who by the time Bilko was through with him was ready to be carted off by the men in the white coats!

This new DVD set brings us a sampling of this shows four seasons and includes the first show(Sept. 20/55) thru to its last show(June 17/59).It also includes a plethora of extras including the pilot,Emmy award show cuts,Phil and the cast on Broadway,and many,many more. Each episode is introduced briefly by Allan Melvin who played Corporal Henshaw.

Technically this set brings the show back to us in marvellous clarity and it has never looked as well.

Look for appearances by Dick Van Dyke,Larry Storch and the first ever TV appearances by Allan Alda and Fred Gwynne.

In the /90s CBS(through 20th Century Fox) released a 3 VHS-six episode edition culled from the show. I thought the shows they included in that set were some of the most lacklustre and mediocre ones they could have picked,with some exceptions of course. In fact if one hadn't seen the show before and that set was their first introduction to it,I'm sure they probably would have never watched another episode. It didn't show enough of the high energy/ever scheming character that made the show what it was. However THIS new DVD set has no such shortcomings as it has more episodes and is much better balanced which is sure to please every Phil Silvers/Bilko fan out there.

In conclusion these 18 episodes of the classic ""Phil Silver Show"" are a must have for comedy and TV fans alike and they are in beautiful condition both visually and audially. It looks like Paramount is testing the waters to see how this set will fly with the buying public before it releases all four seasons. I only hope it's a success for all our sake.",1148688000,,3505,4.715686274509804
7166604,5,B00X8RONG4,"Sgt. Bilko was the top comedy of it's day (1955-59), and those of us who watched it all when it first aired during those years have never forgotten the laughs it gave us.  For some odd reason, CBS cancelled this series at it's peak popularity. This 3 disc set is a fair sampling of the Bilko series, with excellent refurbished picture quality, amazing considering it's age. Paramount would be wise to issue all 142 shows from this  legendary series in the near future:  boomers like myself will by them up, just like we bought up other classic comedies from TV's golden age: Andy Griffith, Sid Caesar, Jackie Gleason etc.
