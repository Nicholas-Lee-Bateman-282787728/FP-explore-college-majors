8202381,5,B000RRQOYM,"This is a true gem in Pavel's work, covering the ""Yin"" half of performance mastery. I'd recommend this video plus one of his more ""Yang"" based products such as ""The Naked Warrior"" for a full athletic package. As for the DVD: It's Pavel's signature syllabus of combining insights with exercises to practice the tenets of his wisdom. The DVD has a ""loose"" section first followed by a ""fast and loose"" section, with gems of wisdom sprinkled throughout. The elements of vibration, passive breathing, bounce/ballistic, and circulation make up the quadripartite of principles illustrated in Fast & Loose. My only wish is that there was a book version as well as his books generally reveal more of his ""Russian Secrets"" than the videos.",1444089600,,729,4.983606557377049

8202383,5,B000RRQOYM,"As a martial artist, being able to relax is a key to recovery and injury prevention. This is a really short video with some great techniques which will increase dynamic flexibility as well aid in the mastery of relaxation.

Many athletes don't realize that one of the keys to fast and smooth movements is lowering the tension in the body. Runners who are good call this, ""the float"".

Pavel does a great job showing all exercises with no fluff. It's pure content.",1431043200,,463,4.634146341463414

8202385,1,B000RRQOYM,real cheap shot here from dragon door. $30 for a few additional considerations that should have been developed in super joints.,1413072000,,127,5.095238095238095
8202386,5,B000RRQOYM,"If you want someone to drone on and on without showing you anything than this video is not for you.  Juat like all of Pavel instructional products it is consise and to the point.  His excersises, drills and streaches are very effective and you can count on results.  This video contains performances drills only and I recomend it as part of an excersize and streching routine.  Pavels ""Power to the People"" and ""Beyond Streching"" are good products to round out such a routine.",1254528000,4,476,4.698795180722891
8202387,3,B000RRQOYM,Not a bad product but expected more.  A lot of the loosening up techniques in this video can easily be observed by going to a wrestling meet.  I more or less used most of the stuff long before buying this video.  For someone who is unfamiliar with competitive sports this would be good.  Not really worth the money if you've been around any kind of sports program.  It does break down the ideas well enough.  But overall the video would only be worthwhile for novices.,1238803200,4,468,4.447058823529412
