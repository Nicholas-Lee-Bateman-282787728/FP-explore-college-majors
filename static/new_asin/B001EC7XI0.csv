8297624,3,B001EC7XI0,"This film is in English with Dutch subtitles. The DVD is in the PAL video format so you may have to watch the film on your laptop in the US. I thought this film might be good because it is about amateur theater and stars Steven Berkoff, a serious theater artist. Unfortunately, I found the film to be utterly silly. The film itself was as bad as the theater company it was mocking. Even Steven Berkoff gives a hammy performance. The story of failed artistic endeavors can be tragic or comic, but this movie just manages to make everyone look pathetic.",1431993600,,551,4.465346534653466
