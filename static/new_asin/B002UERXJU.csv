If you are an American (or not) you need to watch this wether you can take a trip to one of these places or not. I felt sheer joy, sadness, inspiration and Love for all things natural while enjoying this series. I could watch it over and over again and not get tired of it.
  The only problem I encountered was that I never received the music soundtrack CD that was suppose to be part of the package. Sincerely, Bill",1380931200,2,487,4.282608695652174
