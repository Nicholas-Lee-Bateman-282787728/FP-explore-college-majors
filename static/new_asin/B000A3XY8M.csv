2357267,4,B000A3XY8M,"I picked this DVD up cheap at the local discount store and was pleasantly surprised to find it not only enjoyable, but aerobically effective too. The routine is brisk enough to raise my heart rate, and the poses are (for me) sufficiently challenging to make them interesting.  Also, Freytag's cueing is exceptionally good - clear and dynamic. My only complaints are: the final stretch session is very brief and the bouncy, cheesy, synthetic music becomes a bit irritating after a few repetitions.",1186704000,,496,5.048780487804878
2357268,5,B000A3XY8M,"This is a great exercise dvd for those of us who want to work out without hurting ourselves. It may not be the one for fitness fanatics but if you are fairly fit, just not in the best shape of your life, and wanting to get back some of what you've lost, this is a good one to start with. I've been checking out workout dvd's at the library to prevent wasting money on those I'm not ready for, or am uncomfortable with. This one is a winner, it's not too easy, not too hard. The movements are fast enough to work up a sweat and challenging enough to prevent boredom. Just the fact that the trainer is not annoying is a plus.",1185321600,,623,4.073170731707317
2357269,5,B000A3XY8M,"I'm on the cusp of turning 50 and am on a crusade to regain my health through diet, exercise, and meditation. I practiced yoga in my 20s and was unsure how I would do nearly 30 years later.

I became inspired after hearing Mariel Hemingway speak at a women's luncheon. I bought both of her books and got her yoga series ""Yoga Now"" with Rodney Yee. I love that series but then found this DVD. I am a ""Dummies"" fan so was thrilled to come upon this workout.

I alternate between the 3 DVDs (Yoga Now has two DVDs - one shorter and the other nearly an hour long) - depending on how much time I have.

I must admit that I think this is my favorite of all the yoga DVDs I've viewed. One of the main things I like about this DVD is it gives you a good warm up and cool down. So many of the other DVDs I've experienced that say they're for beginners just plain aren't. They jump right in with fairly complex poses with virtually no explanation.

Chris may appear a bit robotic to some but I think she is a good instructor. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in a great aerobic yoga workout!",1177286400,10,1097,4.136150234741784
2357270,4,B000A3XY8M,"I have never done any type of yoga before, and I am no gym junkie either, but I did not find this workout too hard to follow...just don't expect to completely hang with it at first - you have to get to where you know what's coming next, and some parts will always be easier than others. Challenging, yes, but just enough.  I like the pace and it really does get your heart rate up.  Chris is a bit of cheesy robot but I like her.  Great routine!",1155254400,11,445,4.034090909090909
2357271,3,B000A3XY8M,"As a person who is not experienced at doing yoga, I found the dvd hard to follow. It is fast paced and I would recommend watching it first before doing it. On the other hand, I'm sure once I learn the routine, it will be a fun and effective workout. The problem is, there is no beginners routine. Also it would have helped if she showed how to do the pose first, then had you do it. Overall, the instuctor is motivational. Just found it hard to keep up with pace first time around, and had to skip second phase because I am out of shape. I will however continue to try and write a new review after I start to see results.",1154736000,11,621,4.056910569105691
2357272,4,B000A3XY8M,I use this DVD with the help of a Swiss Exercise Ball and get a good workout and stretch.  I felt somewhat ill using some poses without the ball.,1142294400,,145,4.0
2357273,5,B000A3XY8M,"I have been yoga for years ; in fact, I go to a yoga class once a week while doing this and I must say for 30 minutes you certainly get your money's worth. I don't have a lot of time nor do I care for yoga that is complex or too fast. This is just right for me in the mornings. it wakes me up and I didn't have to review it before I started. the moves are that simple. tried it once from a friend and I love it. i want my own copy. The dummies series is the best for getting quick and easy to follow information. Keep them coming ....",1141689600,6,534,3.692982456140351
2357274,1,B000A3XY8M,I got this DVD for only $9.99 and good thing too because if I had paid anymore I'd be pretty upset. The DVD isn't as easy to follow as it claims. Perhaps it might be easy to follow for someone at a higher level of experience but not for beginners. On top of that the way Chris Freytag grins through out the entire workout is reminiscent of a robot.,1140307200,15,348,4.057971014492754

2357291,3,B000A3XY8M,"A solid short cardio yoga workout. This is one of the first yoga routines I did regularly and I found it easy to follow and just challenging enough to get me sweating, with lots of repetition and a fast-moving flow.  The ""for dummies"" add-ons, like the little pop-up reminders, get annoying after doing the DVD a few times, but that happens with a lot of DVDs I guess.  If you are new to yoga, I recommend a slower hatha-based flow to start, or read a couple yoga books before starting this quick series.  The cool down is a little short, and there's no corpse pose at the end.",1312588800,,577,4.324074074074074

2357315,5,B000A3XY8M,"This is a great DVD.  The preview video sold me on this one and the fact that it is produced and directed by Andrea Ambandos, who is very experienced in this field.  It has the right tensity and movement I was looking for -- not to fast and not to slow.  The movements are not hard to perform, nice and smooth.  The music is not bad either, it keeps me motivated throughout the entire video.  I've had the video for over a couple of weeks now and I can see and feel the results.  I have more energy and it is a great stress reliever.

I recommend this DVD to others who are just starting out or wanting to add on to their current workout routine.",1256947200,,646,4.079365079365079
2357316,3,B000A3XY8M,"You have to be familiar with yoga poses in order to do this workout, as no instruction is offered. It is a fast-paced yoga based workout that I enjoyed, but I found the music really annoying.",1249257600,,191,4.333333333333333
2357317,4,B000A3XY8M,I am enjoying this workout. I feel that I have exercised when I am through but I don't hurt.,1248825600,,92,3.8947368421052633
2357318,4,B000A3XY8M,"I ordered this DVD along with a bunch of other ones, including some Jillian Michaels ones, and right now those are what I'm focusing on.  I tried this one once and I found it to be enjoyable and easy.

It's about 35 minutes long once you get started, and it flows from one pose to another.  I love Chris Freytag, and she takes time telling you how to do the poses, then picks up the pace once you've gone through them.

I gave it 4 stars because it's not as intense as what I'm into doing right now, but it's still a good workout for a yoga workout. I'll definitely use it from time to time, when I'm looking to do a little extra exercise.",1233014400,,639,4.088
2357319,3,B000A3XY8M,"I just did this video for the first time this morning and I was surprised at how sore my knees were afterward.  Now they are not the greatest to begin with, but not terrible either - I can run a few miles if I'm careful.  But I took a yoga class at the local college this past semester, and I had no problems whatsoever with my knees.  The instructor gave us time to get into each pose correctly, the whole while giving tips on how to do each pose correctly, and then gave us time to get into the next pose correctly.

THIS VIDEO, however, DOES NOT give one time to move from pose to pose correctly, nor adequate tips on how to get into the poses correctly.  I'm sure that's why my knees are sore.  I don't see other complaints of this, so if you have no problems with your knees to begin with you may not have one with this video.  But if you do have creaky knees, or cannot run because of knee issues, I would not recommend this video.

Beyond the knee issue, the  video provides a decent amount of stretching, light strengthening maneuvers, and a couple of balance poses - which is all you can really ask of a 35 minute more-or-less beginning video.

I would not count on this video as my main exercise for weight loss.  It is a nice adjunct as it will help with flexibility and balance, but if my experience in achieving and maintaining a 50-lb weight loss is any indication, you would do well to consider more strength training and some cardio that involves moving yourself in a way that requires real exertion, and not just movement per se.  Try running (not jogging), jumping rope, swimming (sprints, not leisurely), cycling, rowing, etc. in addition to strength training.  Of course you will need to work up to those levels - always start slowly, but do keep pushing yourself.  Also cut out all sugar and grains, eat lean protein, fresh organic fruits and vegetables and you will lose quickly and without hunger pangs.  Sugar and grains fuel the appetite, protein and vegetables quell it.  And I do love yoga for the gains one can make in core strength, flexibility, and balance, so it's definitely worth taking a class or finding an excellent video.  Good luck!",1213315200,,2170,4.467005076142132
2357320,3,B000A3XY8M,"Is there anyone who can review this and say that they lost weight? there are lots of yoga dvd's available. I did yoga for years, even taught beginners, but I never lost weight. I'm older now and want something restorative to complement the cardio and weight work I do, but I want to continue to lose weight. Does this really help with weight loss or is it just about feeling energized or relaxed?",1211760000,,396,4.438356164383562
2357321,5,B000A3XY8M,"I really like this workout. It is easy to follow. I also have Pilates weight loss for dummies, but I like this one better. It is a 35 minute workout. 20 minutes of standing yoga and 15 minutes of mat work. I would recommend it.",1211241600,,227,4.066666666666666
2357322,5,B000A3XY8M,"I bought this DVD in search of a yoga-based weight loss routine, and found exactly what I was looking for. I have some basic yoga experience and while I don't know if this routine would be feasible for a real beginner, I would recommend it to anyone else. The pace is lively and intense, though not so much so that it takes twenty minutes to cool down. I was painfully sore for about two days after my first run-through, but I was surprised how dramatically the charlie horse eased with only one or two more run-throughs. Chris Freytag did seem a bit eerily robotic at first, but again it was easy to adjust too, as was the music.

My main issue with this program is the few sections during the mat work that I find too fast-paced. Specifically, it is difficult for me to move from either version of side-plank to child's pose and back as fast as Freytag does. Still, it is just something to work on. I also wish that just a bit more relaxation was added to the end, but the amount provided is sufficient.

In short, I would not hesitate to recommend this DVD to anyone with a familiarity with the groundwork of yoga who is looking for a workout. I would certainly purchase another Dummies program along these lines, should one ever be released.",1211155200,,1245,4.432314410480349
2357323,5,B000A3XY8M,"This DVD was a pleasant surprise when I first borrowed it from my local library (and I've borrowed all that they have).  It's reasonable and paced well (at least for me).  Probably because it's part of the ""for Dummies"" series, it has enough technical information in it to be interesting - more than most.  It's taped in a studio, so you don't get the breathtaking scenery and the music could be a little more up to date, but, (and here's the big but (really sorry about that pun)) there's nothing annoying about this DVD.  Most other DVD's I've rented or purchased have some annoying element that makes it difficult to put back into the machine for the 30th time.  Not so with this one.  The workouts are challenging enough, the leader is perky - but not too perky, and the Yoga-ish meditation-oriented stuff is not included.  I wasn't looking for a meditation guide but for a low impact workout.  I am VERY happy with this DVD and will certainly buy it again if this one gets damaged.",1208217600,,986,4.531073446327683
2357324,5,B000A3XY8M,"I have several yoga dvd's I've boughten trying to find the right one.  I was pleasantly surprised by this dvd.  I have had previous injuries to my joints but I can still do it no problem.  It also gets my heart rate up.  I would reccomend this to anyone.

This isn't a relaxation type of yoga.  This would be more associated with power yoga or pilates.  It get's your heart rate up.  Though it does still use traditional yoga poses, it just moves through them at a slighlty faster rate.",1188691200,,486,4.322222222222222
