2632107,5,B000H8CADU,"Nest videos are awesome! I was first introduced to these 15 years ago when our first was born. We had them on VHS and glad to replace those with new DVD's. The Good Samaritan has always been a favorite with all the kids. The animation is nice and well done, and the stories are beautifully told.",1318204800,2,295,4.285714285714286
2632108,1,B000H8CADU,"This video features Anglo-centric representations of characters and a ridiculous caricature of a Jewish person questioning Christ. But the real problem with it is its' enhancements. The makers of this film decided to enhance the Parable of the Good Samaritan by fleshing out the story. Unfortunately, rather than wholesome entertainment,this version strays so far from the original parable that it could be an advertisement for boring. I've decided to order the Veggie Tales: Are You My Neighbor? I will do a traditional telling of the Good Samaritan followed by the Veggie Tales movie with snacks. This NEST version of the Good Samaritan is going to a thrift store. I hope they don't overcharge the next owner.",1252108800,,711,5.137931034482759
2632109,4,B000H8CADU,"In this cartoon Bible parable we meet Ezra, a spice merchant and his two little children.  He is about to embark on a dangerous journey to Jericho.  Meanwhile, at Gaal's Inn two robbers plan to set a trap for travelers.  One robber is ""the brains"" of their operation, and the other is stupid, but anybody who makes the mistake of calling him that will be sorry.  We briefly meet two other Jewish men who will be traveling the road to Jericho, and finally we meet Caleb the Samaritan on a journey to deliver a horse.  Caleb is shown being attacked by a mob of Jews in Jerusalem to demonstrate the hatred between the Jews and the Samaritans.  With all the background in place the familiar parable unfolds.

The animation is good, though not elaborate.  The characters are interesting and well acted, especially the two robbers.

This would be a good teaching tool for use at home or with a Sunday school class.",1236038400,4,908,4.555555555555555
