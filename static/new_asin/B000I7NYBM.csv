I asked my dad why didn't he go UDT and he said it was hard to pass all the tests to get in. This is a good series as I remember it, and watching it now it's still somethin I enjoy. I have all 4 seasons.",1418083200,,327,3.4324324324324325
8144297,3,B000I7NYBM,"Terrible sound quality. Had to return it. Wish it was better.
 I would have liked to have kept it, brought back a lot of memories.
 Great show! No hassle return.",1327276800,,161,4.333333333333333
8144298,4,B000I7NYBM,Volume 4 was good.  should have been enhanced and better behind the scenes bios and all that good stuff.  Still great to see it again.  it has been almost 40 years since i`ve seen it.  I use to play sea hunt when i was a kid.  tie a pillow to your back and swimm up the stairs and all around the house!  What can i say we did not have video games back then.  we had to use our brains for fun.,1285372800,,392,3.707317073170732
8144299,1,B000I7NYBM,"Most of DVDs are blank. Meaning there is nothing there. Won't play on my iMac, PC, DVD player or my Xbox 360. And no way to contact company to get replacements.",1249603200,,160,4.193548387096774
8144300,5,B000I7NYBM,"This is a great show wished it was done in colour would've been great to see. I've got volumes 1 & 4 wanna get the other volumes,it's even better watching the show as a adult cos it's fairly educational in the under water scenes. If you're a fan of the show get! It's not a studio release,but it's still worth it.",1179100800,4,313,4.147540983606557
8144301,2,B000I7NYBM,This DVD set is as basic as it gets and not really worth the price. The labels are plain white with the disk number on it. The episodes have not been enhanced in any way. There are no behind the scene features or cast bios. Basically you pay for a DVD copy of the show period.,1171152000,5,276,3.9464285714285716
