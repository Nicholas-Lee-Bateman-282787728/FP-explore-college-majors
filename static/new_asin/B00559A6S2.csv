8457665,3,B00559A6S2,"Henry King, then 73 and lent out from Fox, made this larger (and wider) scale Universal soap opera in 1959 as a very distant premake of the similarly star-packed FALCON CREST. King's film also parallels contemporary projects such as Delmer Daves' Warners melodramas with Dorothy McGuire or Vincente Minnelli's neglected dynastic-family drama HOME FROM THE HILL. Rock Hudson's first-billed presence almost brings the film into loftier and glossier Douglas Sirk melos territory, although his lesser performance here is much closer to GIANT's Bick Benedict. This is an expensive cast, large and unique, and Hudson and Jean Simmons are rather overshadowed by glamourous McGuire (flaunting a cigarette holder), Claude Rains, Anna Lee and Kent Smith, those four veterans very characterful. The soapy plot complications are predictably tedious, revolving around inheritances, birthrights, paternity real or fantasized, and there are tiresome plot subthreads concerning French-German-Italian viniculture, cooperative marketing and circumventing Prohibition. (FALCON CREST did all of these tropes far more concisely, focusing entirely on sex and stellar guest cameos).

Still, THIS EARTH IS MINE (not to be confused with Jean Renoir's THIS LAND IS MINE reuniting Laughton with O'Hara) is beautifully mounted in vintage widescreen Technicolor, correctly letterboxed in this Spanish print. The studio set decoration is more elaborate than usual in most Universal A-pictures, and the authenticated Napa Valley locations are varied and artfully photographed by Winton Hoch and Russell Metty. The film looks greater than its parts, and it sounds larger owing to its fine score by Hugo Friedhofer. Director King--active since 1915 and two inferior films short of retirement--always handled regional Americana most comfortably, and here his late landscape work in widescreen format is very impressive. Right off the bat there's a perfectly staged ""Last Supper"" poolside banquet, extensive tracking shots along the vineyard rows, and a bitchy conservatory-confrontation scene for McGuire vs. Simmons that alone justifies the film's sudsy script, the very pricey stars and the first-rate cinematography. The money spent on this film--stars, locations, sets and costumes--really shows on the wider screen, and followers of Hudson, Simmons (or Henry King) will find this a shamefree guilty pleasure.",1498348800,,2379,5.8166189111747855

8457671,4,B00559A6S2,"This film is one of those pot-boiler dramas the big studios used to crank out to showcase their current stars, as well as their up and comers.  The stars carry this film on their shoulders.  Rock Hudson and Jean Simmons sizzle as the romantic leads, with performances that manage to rise above the melodrama of a depression era battle between two families whose vineyards are competing for dominance while angling to destroy each other.  Not sure why this one hasn't made it out on a domestic U.S. DVD archive sales list, or for that matter, been shown on TCM.  It's worth a look and will entertain those who find the melodramas of the 50s (think Peyton Place) a fascinating genre.",1379980800,8,681,4.65
