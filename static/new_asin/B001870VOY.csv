3412034,5,B001870VOY,"This really brings back the memories of watching this show with my friends and how ""cool"" the hulk was.  We would wait for the scenes where David Banner would get into trouble and were so anxious to finally see his eyes turn and know the hulk was coming.  I've only ever seen the shows on tv until now and the dvd quality is the best I have seen for this show.  I now watch these with my sons, and they feel the way I did when I was their age.",1245715200,11,443,3.9
3412035,5,B001870VOY,"I would only recommend this if you don't already have any of the seasons which are available seperately. Otherwise, unless you are getting it as a gift, its a waste of money.

I gave this set 5 stars only because of the show itself which is a classic! For those that don't know the premise, it involves Dr. David Banner who was searching for the extra strength that all humans have in times of danger but his experiments go wrong and now he changes into a green behemoth whenever anger strikes! Believed to be dead, he is pursued by an investigative reporter (who thinks that the creature killed Dr. Banner and his assistant), all the while he struggles to contain the beast within him and to find a cure for his condition.

As I said, I would only purchase this if you have none of the seasons. A great series no matter what!",1242000000,5,826,4.392156862745098
3412036,5,B001870VOY,"I love classic TV shows, and I have such nostalgic memories of this growing up watching this show on TV. I look back on it now and I think the series itself holds up really well by todays standards.

Respects to the late Bill Bixby. You are missed, RIP.",1238803200,26,253,4.163265306122449
3412037,5,B001870VOY,"I'm a fan of the show.  I have been since the late 70s-early 80s.  I was about 4 when the show first aired. I didn't start watching the show til it ran in syndication two or three years later.  I loved the show so much that I bought the best of The Incredible Hulk a few years ago from this site.  I have since received Seasons one and two as gifts within the last 2 months.

I don't see the point in buying the complete boxed set if you have already started collecting the seasons seperately.  I also don't see the point in purchasing this set if you don't have the money to do so.  I think food and clothes and bills come first right now.  If you have the extra money to buy The Incredible Hulk Complete Series Boxed Set then by all means purchase this set.  For those of us struggling right now, we have to think of more pressing things like bills, food, clothes, ect.

Someday, I will complete my collection of The Incredible Hulk Series but not today. The price is good but in today's economy we must budget what little we do have.",1232928000,2,1036,4.186868686868687
3412038,4,B001870VOY,"This INCREDIBLE HULK-Complete Series sounds neat, since it contains every single episode from all 5 seasons throughout THE INCREDIBLE HULK's whole 1978-82 run on CBS, but since times are obviously tight right now and since Universal already has all 5 seasons released on DVD and already had the Hulk's 5th and final season released on DVD last Fall on the same day as this was released on DVD, I don't see why Universal felt it was necessary to make a complete series DVD of this Science-Fiction drama, especially in these tight economic times most people are struggling through the recession going on right now.

Therefore, the only reason I can think of on why Universal decided to make this INCREDIBLE HULK-The Complete Series DVD was probably due to a major reason called MONEY! since businesses everywhere all over the country are seeing a decline in sales right now in todays depressing economy.

Therefore, it's hard to purchase a complete series DVD that costs over a hundred simolians while everybody is feeling the hasty thrifty crunch right now while people all over the world are getting laid off left and right with all these hefty budget cuts that are wreaking havoc on the whole world right now.

Therefore, most people are less likely to purchase a complete series DVD of this science-fiction show or any other show for that matter when people are and were able to buy each season on DVD one by one, which was way cheaper since each season was only under a hundred bucks apiece.

The truth is, I'm considering on getting this complete series DVD of THE INCREDIBLE HULK, since I was a big fan of this show and used to watch it religiously every week on CBS during it's whole 4-year run, but it probably won't be for a while and hopefully this DVD will contain some genuine bonus features that we couldn't watch on any of the other INCREDIBLE HULK DVD's that were released season by season although I have a feeling this DVD is probably nothing more than a waste of money if you already have the whole DVD collection of THE INCREDIBLE HULK from Season 1 all the way through Season 5, but I don't understand why Universal felt it was necessary to make this complete series DVD box set since none of the individual season DVD box sets had any flaws or double sided discs that froze or skipped either since all 5 seasons of THE INCREDIBLE HULK came with single sided disc only as opposed to the double sided discs that froze and skipped on KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 2, MIAMI VICE-SEASON 1, KNIGHT RIDER-SEASON 4, MIAMI VICE-SEASON 2, THE A-TEAM-SEASON 2, and THE A-TEAM-SEASON 4, which is probably why Universal doesn't make DVD box sets with 2-sided disks anymore and why they haven't done so in 3 years, but I don't think this THE INCREDIBLE HULK-The Complet Series DVD is to make up or compensate for any flaws made on the indididual season box sets that were released season by season one at a time between the Summer of 2006 and the Fall of 2008.

It's just too bad that this science-fiction drama couldn't last longer and that THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th and last season had to be cut short, despite its high ratings, but unfortunately CBS cancelled this show abruptly in mid November of 1981, due to budget cuts and a change in management at CBS along with the fact that the special effects on the show got too expensive especially for the Hulk-out scenes, due to the recession we had back in 1981-1982 during Ronald Reagan's presidency.

Therefore CBS had uncerimoniously announced in July of 1981 when its 5th Season was underway that they were cancelling THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the Fall of 1981 even though the ratings were still going strong, so creator(Ken Johnson)had to compromise with CBS by making the Hulk's Fifth Season only half a season with only 7 episodes, which was why CBS had cancelled THE INCREDIBLE HULK all of the sudden on such short notice in November of 1981 along with the fact that the president at CBS at the time(Harve Shepherd) felt that the Hulk was getting tired and that this science-fiction drama was running out of steam along with the fact that rumor has it that both Bill Bixby(David Banner) and Lou Ferrigno(The Hulk)found it difficult to work with Ken Johnson and that Johnson could never come up with a suitable budget with CBS to keep running this show either, which left Hulk fans being and feeling cheated since nobdy knew that THE INCREDIBLE HULK was going to be axed when it was, but CBS had brought the show back on the air temporarily in the Spring of 1982 for about 2 weeks to finish off the remaining 2 episodes of THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th and last season, which were the ""Slaves"" episode and the ""A Minor Problem"" episode, yet CBS still didn't have a series finally episode proving to us once again that the recluse David(Bill Bixby)still hadn't found a cure for his struggling ordeal with the Hulk and that the Hulk was still being tracked by the persistent obsessed newspaper reporter Jack McGee(Jack Colvin), but what I don't understand is why was McGee no where to be found in THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 5th Season, but still had his name on the credits and introduction to THE INCREDIBLE HULK's 1981-82 Season as the investigative reporter pursuing the Hulk, yet McGee barely only came out on 1 episode in the Hulk's Fifth Season, which was the ""Triangle"" episode only, which was the last episode shown before this science-fiction drama was cancelled all of the sudden in the mid Fall of 1981 after the ""Triangle"" episode was shown on its original air-date which was Friday November 13th, 1981.

Therefore, this shows sudden cancellation was very similar to when CBS abruptly cancelled WONDER WOMAN in the early Fall of 1979 since the last 2 episodes of WONDER WOMAN ""The Man Who Couldn't Die"" & ""The Phantom Of The Rollercoaster"" led us to beleive that CBS was kicking off a 4th Season of WONDER WOMAN before CBS cancelled WONDER WOMAN all of the sudden in mid September of 1979 when THE INCREDIBLE HULK had kicked off its 3rd Season on CBS.

Therefore, chances are CBS already had plans in the Summer of 1979 underway to cancel WONDER WOMAN in the Autumn of 1979 just like CBS already had plans to cancel THE INCREDIBLE HULK in the Autumn of 1981 when the Hulks 5th Season was already in the works with 7 episodes already in the can which contributed to THE INCREDIBLE HULKs 1981-82 Season being an abbreviated season, except WONDER WOMAN had no 4th Season or even half a season before WONDER WOMAN was axed after showing its very last episode on Tuesday September 11th, 1979.",1232496000,7,6538,4.674196350999131

3412040,1,B001870VOY,"I agree with the second review I read.  Universal also has never released 2 other outstanding Sci-Fi series in the US.  Six Million dollar Man Bionic Woman.

Good Times video has also pulled a fast one.  After all the Little House series is available now they do the complete series.

#3.  The hottest series of the 90's Baywatch still has no complete series in the US.

#4.  The Smallville 7 season came out during its usual September time frame, even though the strike shortened the season's episodes",1221696000,6,502,4.689655172413793
3412041,1,B001870VOY,"It's nice to know that this set is being released after the first four seasons already hit the street. Another gimmick from Universal to squeeze our hard-earned wages from our pockets? You bet!!!

Before Universal announced the release of the 1st season, they released a fan favorite set entitled the Ultimate Collection. This collected the very best of the entire series knowing that the fans would clear the shelves. Seeing that they struck gold, they went ahead and released season 1. Season 2 followed, along with seasons 3 & 4, and not a word of a complete series box set until the damaged was done. Why? Simple. Milk the people dry!

Hats off, Universal! I just hope you have enough space in your warehouses for all those complete series box sets that nobody's gonna buy.",1220313600,10,777,4.7481481481481485

I could not wait until Friday night came so I could plant myself right in front of the tv and not be disturbed while I watched it. I had such a mad crush on Lou Ferrigno and he has not changed one bit. Bill Bixby left us way too soon and was saddened by his passing. He and Lou worked so well together. He WAS the Hulk and Bill WAS David. The Hulk movies that are out today with those CGI of the Hulk, they just don't compare to the real thing. This series will always hold a special place in my heart. I bought the 3 movies, Trial of the Incredible Hulk, The Incredible Hulk Returns and Death of the Incredible Hulk about a couple of years or so ago so now my Incredible Hulk series collection is complete.

I've just started watching the eps last night. I watched the first 5 eps and will watch more tonight. It's like being a kid again planting myself right in front of the tv but this time, I have this forever and can watch anytime I want.

ordered the complete series. all 82 episodes and enjoyed them all. The guest stars at the time were great

3412110,5,B001870VOY,"G. Garner was spot on. Bill Bixby made the show. My 12 year old son, who I named David, is starting to enjoy watching the show. I hope he can mirror the attributes of David Banner. I try to teach him how to pay it forward, to help strangers in any way possible to make the world a better place. David Banner was a character ahead of his time as this is what he does while searching for a cure. He doesn't want to get involved yet his conscience won't let him leave a location/situation until the issue has been resolved.

For not being able to speak Lou Ferrigno does a great acting job being able to convey his emotions other than anger. He let out an earth shattering roar when he realized Elaina was dead in the pilot and his body motion leading up to that (his facial expression and heavy breathing) made me believe that he understood. He smiles and shows a lighter side when near children. It's clear he can show the same compassion that's demonstrated by David Banner. I love to see the legacy of the Hulk continue by seeing Lou in The King of Queens. Although he only appears in 6 episodes there are a few Hulk references. One episode that is one of my favorites is called Gym Neighbors where Lou has a significant role as trainer to the lead characters Doug and Carrie.

I like to believe Jack McGee really thinks the Hulk is good as he saved his life in Mystery Man and there were numerous other situations of him witnessing the Hulk righting a wrong. I'll be looking closer for this as I watch all the episodes.

I was turned off by the Hulk movie made in the early 2000's, particularly the Hulk with CGI. I liked the idea of the Hulk being played by a real person. And no one could replace Bill Bixby or Jack Colvin. The original series will be the only part of The Incredible Hulk that I will remain loyal to.",1384128000,,1821,4.272463768115942

3412133,4,B001870VOY,"When I was young I remember enjoying this series very much. It is not like the comic book or recent films it is done as a tv series that stayed on for 5 years in the 80s. Each episode is a drama with character development as the key ingredient in each episode. The acting is topnotch with the late Bill Bixby carrying the burden each week and doing a fine job as Banner.
Kenneth Johnson is the producer and writer for this series he also did the original V series and was producer of Bionic Woman with Lindsay Wagner in the 70s.
It was done with a care and professionalism and it shows. The shows back then were done in a formuliac fashion and watching the shows back to back may get tedious, but if  you space them out and take your time you will be entertained for hours.

I watched the Hulk the first season when it came out and I loved it! Even got the pleasure in '79 of actually meeting Lou Ferrigno when he came for an auto show. Let me tell ya, he's even bigger in person.  But so nice and amazingly light handed when I shook his hand. WOW! I'm hoping this product has my favorite episode, King of the Beach where Lou acts in it without make up and we see him working out and a unique shot of him and the Hulk in the same frame looking at each other. I may not have this yet, and the minute I've got the money I'm getting it, but I'm still a Hulk fan of the television series.

The score's writer unfortunately passed away in '06 so this product is extra special I'd imagine listening to the score.

Of course, the criteria which is most important is usually the most complicated, to discuss each: Emotion is not a tangible thing; it is what you feel. Or rather in this case, it is the ""feeling"" you want the film to convey or make. I.E. A horror film conveys terror etc. Now this is usually, or is, the hardest ideal to push throughout the entire film. Murch brings up an interesting point though in where he points out that when a person (an average audience) first discusses a film they never talk about the technical stuff like the camera or acting but rather how the film made them ""feel"". So one can see why emotion is so important - being that it is the undercurrent of the entire film.

The second criteria - Story, simply, suggests that the cut continues the story. Rhythm, the third, refers to the flow of the film, making sure that the rhyth",1343001600,,976,4.3812154696132595

The box it comes in is simple yet smart in design (I get a kick outta the raised lettering) and most of the discs are in their own slim-line cases. There are a few that have 2 discs per case but they are packed on front and rear covers so that if 1 does come lose (which doesn't seem likely due to their construction) there's no chance of it affecting the quality (scratching) of the other disc as their labels face each other. This set is the perfect example of how simple yet great a packaging design can be for a large set. I wish all the companies followed this route instead of using the cheap cardboard slits for multi-disc sets which so many have had nightmares with in the past (myself included) with discs getting scratched.

Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno are awesome team and I don't think they could have picked a better person than Lou for the Hulk.

I think this series captured the Hulk very well, although both current movies were done pretty well.

The packaging is done very well, although because everything is in one package you have to dig for the season or disk you want to watch - still that only takes seconds to do; let's not get too lazy.

Picture quality for a series from the 1970's and 1980's is very good. I have a Blu-ray player with a 1080 Samsung TV and it really upgrades the quality of the picture.

Bill Bixby portrays David Banner very well and Lou Ferrigno sells the ego of the Hulk.

3412180,5,B001870VOY,"I just love all the old shows from the 70's and 80's.  While it's nice to be able to use streaming services (Like Amazon!) I enjoy buying DVD's for 1 main reason.  If I have it, then I have it.  Period.  For example - I was really enjoying streaming Quincy, M.E. on another stream server - when I was in about season 6, something must have happened with their licensing, and it became unavailable.  Frustrating.  I'd buy it, but IT'S NOT AVAILABLE - Hello - whoever holds the copyright - MAKE IT INTO DVD!!!

Now - on to the Hulk.

My set came and is exactly what I expected.  No disappointment here.  I've watched the pilot and am pleased with the quality.  I just LOVE re-watching this old show that I loved back in the day and at the current sale price (28.99 for the entire series AND free Amazon prime shipping) it's UNBEATABLE.

A note to others who own the rights to other shows - there are tens of THOUSANDS of us who will buy old shows if you bring the price down to an affordable level.

Other reviewers have mentioned the packaging.  I kinda like the box with the bubble lettering.  It's neat.  That said, I would have preferred that they stacked ALL the DVD's and made the box deeper and less wide - thus enabling it to fit in peoples standard ""made for DVD"" shelving units.  Of cource you can remove all the slim jewelboxes and store them that way.  Others have commented that it's ""re-packaging"".  I say SO WHAT?  I have nothing against slim jewelboxes.  Heck, each DVD has it's own case - how better protected could it be?  It is, however, kind of amusing that the first DVD contains your free ticket to a movie that has been out of the theaters for several years!!!

Bottom line - if you liked this old series - BUY IT NOW - The price is unbeatable and the quality is just fine.

Hope my review helped some of you...

I was concerned with ordering that there would be something amiss with this set, but I was wrong. This is the complete series in a collectors box that holds all the individual DVD cases. Individually each season sells used for about $20, so I was amazed by this deal. I received this brand new yesterday, and started to enjoy one of my favorite shows from my childhood. Its really amazing to see the acting that was in TV shows from the 70s and 80s. Bill Bixby was an amazing actor, and his work on the TV adaptation of the Marvel comic series was one of the first screen successes for Marvel. Combine that with dramatic writing, and just a bit of cheesy action, and you have the recipe for a hit. Lou Ferrigno was perfect as the Hulk, as he was a mix of muscle and emotion. Whether he was smashing through a cardboard wall, or carrying someone to safety, you routed for the big green guy. Every kid wanted to be the Hulk. Don't look for big special effects, just enjoy a great show from the late 70s/ early 80s.  For a bit of nostalgia, and a fun time watching, this is a must for fans of the show and/or comics. All the episodes are included, as well as some extras.",1316649600,,1294,4.196787148594377

3412185,4,B001870VOY,"This isn't today's Hulk, and that's the strength of this series. However, if you're reading this review, you most likely are familiar with Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno's portrayal of the classic comic book character. For the show itself, I give it 5 stars. My hangup is the packaging. The box that the set comes in looks great, but inside the box is another story. Instead of forking over the cash to revamp the entire set for this release, it seems that they instead scrapped the season sets, pulled out the DVD cases and stacked them in this set. It's not a deal breaker, but  a bit more work on the set would have been greatly appreciated.",1314230400,,637,4.539130434782609

No booklets provided, however bonus features provide more then enough information on the iconic character ""The Hulk"".  Great gift for young and old.  Bought this for my 8 year old son for Christmas last year. Being that he is an avid fan of the recent ""Hulk"" movies, he saw this in a retail store for $79.00. I made him wait until Christmas were I found it on Amazon for $39.00 new,(worth every penny).  He was gitty is all get out and so was I when he opened it.

3412189,5,B001870VOY,"I really like that they made the Hulk a little bit more believable by not having him talk like a little kid.  Somehow, I think that would have spoiled the effect.  Whereas a lot of super hero films are a little on the cartoonish side, this is something you can really sink your teeth into.  Bill Bixby's interpretaion of David Banner is totally believable, and you can sympathize with him as he struggles to control the beast within him.  Yet one can sympathize with the Hulk as well.  He is not a malicious killer.  He just has his own crude, yet effective ways of dealing out justice.  One grand day, I plan on buying this set.

3412191,5,B001870VOY,"I was just a kid when this program was being aired on television. I first saw it when I was about seven years old and it made a huge impression on me. I remember clearly hiding behind the couch when David Banner morphed into the Hulk and being so sad at the end when he had to go out on the road again with that haunting music playing in the background.

I never forgot the series and since I was not able to watch every episode of each season, it was a really great when I received this set in the post. The box is of good quality and durable. I think the graphics showing the changing of David Banner from himself into the Hulk on the front cover is fantastic. The quality of the DVDs is very good and I love the details like each DVD cover having a different exciting picture of the Hulk or David Banner or the changing process in between. Things like the green DVDs and the raised lettering on them all add to the solid impression that this is a collectors item and that the people who designed this set really did it with passion and an attention to detail. As if they too are fans and really wanted to do this subject as much justice as possible.

It was nice to take a trip down memory lane, to see the clothes and cars of my youth, to see the people and how they were, compared to what we have now become. Obviously seeing things through the eyes of an adult one also sees just how much our society has evolved in positive ways as well.

The Hulk still manages to make a believable impression, the story's are good and Bill Bixby and Lou are simply untoppable. My seven year old son is watching the series with me and also has great interest, it's a strange sense of deja vu seeing him watch something I used to love watching, as if the Hulk is reaching out through the generations. The other day he was running through the house with no shirt roaring at everybody! Even my wife watches some of the episodes, and she is not a Sci fi fan!

My conclusion is, great quality, great detail and still interesting after many years. The price is also not bad, so go out and get it, and be prepared to roar!",1312675200,3,2106,4.179802955665025
3412192,4,B001870VOY,"I ordered the box set on Sunday and received it today. Great service at a fabulous Amazon price. After reading several customer reviews complaining about the size of the box, I was expecting it to be enormous. However, it's only 11 and one quarter inches long, 8 inches wide and 2 and three quarter inches deep. The size is just fine with me and the box is attractive and very sturdy. I do agree with other reviewers that the DVD cases could be packaged better within the box. It's awkward if you want to remove a particular case. The extras are quite interesting and though I've only watched brief snippets of several episodes, the video quality is very good for the most part, though there are some segments that call for remastering. My biggest complaint is the lack of an episode guide that gives the original airdate of each episode. There is no booklet nor are the airdates listed on the DVD cases. I wonder if a booklet comes with the box set and it was left out of my set by mistake. If anyone knows of a booklet, please email me at Shawboy@Webtv.net.",1310083200,2,1059,4.463917525773196

As for the quality of the box set: It was really great, not a disappointment at all. My only issue is that they felt the need to release several different box sets; this one, a 24 disc one...plus the first 3 individual seasons. Now my husband thinks he needs the 24 disc box set as well. Stop releasing so many! I know they are out for the money but jeez!

Also, I thought it sucked that they released the first 3 seasons separately, then you had to buy the box set for the last 2 seasons. Total BS. Hence the 4 stars.",1309132800,,658,4.214285714285714

First off, it's truly ""incredible"" to finally have this classic series in a full box set.  This series is what made the Marvel Comics character a household name.  It was also the star-making series for Bill Bixby, gaining him far more recognition from the public than any of his other series, combined.

Great packaging, and the slim DVDs are nice.  The remastering of the 70s show is just spot-on.

For the entire series, we have only two complaints.

1) This box set does not feature the lenticular covers that the individual season box sets feature.  This is a disappointment for those who waited to buy the complete box set.  Those who waited did NOT get anything extra there for our patience.  This is especially problematic and disappointing for those who bought this set early on at full price.  As of this writing, the lowest price is $30, which is a VERY nice price for a new set.  Despite the nicer price tag for those who wait, the lack of the lenticular art is still a disappointment.  Yes, it costs a little more for the special disc cases, but it's something that should be considered for those fans who (like us!) were looking forward to them.

2) Selection of commentary.  If you bought the ""Pilot""/Married"" disc with commentary, you will have already heard producer Kenneth Johnson's commentary.  So that is a disappointment there.  There are other discs with the same commentary, so why plug ""commentary"" on those particular episodes if there are ones with the same commentary elsewhere?  It's quite frustrating.  Speaking of frustrating, Kenneth Johnson makes repeated references to how much more effective the shots could have been had the ""morphing"" technology existed then, noting the ""Wolf Man"" style shots of the metamorphosis (as in, take a shot, cut, add more make-up, cut, et al).  Our opinion is that it is for that entire reason that the show is so memorable and quaint.  Yeah, there are lots of things that could be done different 30 years later, but the series would not be the same had it been done in 2000, as opposed to 1970.

Also, as a special feature, they ""re-run"" the episodes, ""Stop The Presses"" and ""Homecoming"", which, while interesting episodes, what is the point of putting an episode as a special feature on a DVD box set, where you'll see it anyway?

Back to commentary.  Prometheus is a GREAT episode to put additional commentary on.  The challenge of cutting back and forth from Bill Bixby to Ric Drasin and having to wear the ""white eyes"" contact lenses for most of the two-parter was terrific.  However, we would have liked to see commentary on ""The First"", discussing Harry Townes (Del Frye) and Dick Durock (Frye's Creature), and how they reacted to the contact lenses and the makeup and such, especially Townes, who was a frequent guest star on 60s television, and has a very distinctive voice.  We're sure fans would have loved to hear the genesis of such an episode.  Especially since this episode was included on the ""Ultimate Television Series Collection"" 6-disc box set.

Aside from those two (admittedly minor) gripes, this is a superb box set and definitely worth it!  If you don't buy this box set, you will make me angry.  You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.",1302220800,8,3418,5.02846975088968

3412203,5,B001870VOY,"If you are a fan of this character, then don't hesitate to purchase this complete set in chronological order ASAP. You won't regret it.

I've been a fan of the Incredible Hulk since I was a child and this TV series has contributed a lot to it.  Even thought I also liked the last two movies based on this character (2003 & 2008), I like the Kenneth Johnson's Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno version better because it is more human (literally) and believable.

Dave Bruce Banner is a doctor/scientist who tries to reverse his accidental overdose of gamma ray to go ""back to normal"" and, even though he is not perfect himself, tries to do what is morally right in the different situations and places he encounters.  He is not proud of becoming angry; however, some times he is pushed to become angry and purposely tries to become angry as fast as possible in some life threatening situations where there is no time to keep the cool in order to ""save the day"".  David knows that he (himself) needs the Hulk to come out and take charge in a matter of seconds in some situations.  In other situations he just simply gets so angry that triggers the Hulk-out, even though he tries to keep the cool.  By the way, the Hulk-out transformations are much more fascinating here than what the recent CGI movies have offered.

I'm enjoying these interesting episode plots and the outstanding performances by Bill Bixby and Jack Colvin (Jack MacGee the newspaper reporter who wants to find out where the Hulk comes from).

I don't give this series more than five stars because there is no more stars available here at Amazon but if there were, I would.

I recommend it very much.",1294876800,2,1655,4.598639455782313
3412204,5,B001870VOY,"As a young boy my favorite TV show was The Incredible Hulk.  Of course I loved the Hulk-outs and transformations, but I think what really had me so entranced was Bill Bixby.  He was just so accessible.  He had this everyman quality that made me believe what I was watching was real.  A few decades later I stumbled across this dvd set and said ""what the heck.""  As a grown man I find this series to be more engrossing than I ever did as a child. . .

This series was simply a perfect storm: a producer who decided to bring the source material into a believable real world setting, a physical specimen in Lou Ferrigno (6'4"" bodybuilders are unheard of) to portray the Hulk, and a simply brilliant actor in Bill Bixby who brought gravitas to the show. . .

The transformations are more effective than any CGI that Hollywood utilizes today, for the most part the stories are well-crafted, and the guest stars on the show were fantastic.  And I have to say that the tragic events that occurred in Bill Bixby's real life only made his portrayal of the ultimate ""lonely man,"" David Banner, all the more poignant.  It just feels real. . .

This collection contains the entire Hulk series.  It looks excellent on dvd.  And for the price the resellers are offering it for, this is probably one of the best bargains I've ever seen on a dvd series.  This one's for the whole family, as there are access points for both children and adults.  Go ahead, treat yourself.

So interesting to follow ""David Banner"" in his travels,the places he goes,the people and situations he encounters. I think I've always had a secret wish to just throw a few things in a travel bag and be a free spirit like his character. Maybe that's why the show always appealed to me. Not practical or safe,but I can live it through this great t.v. series.

Today  its  not  very  often  that  I  can  catch  it  on  TV.
&  I  was  so  tired  of  not  being  able  to  watch  it,  so  I  got  the  entire  series  on  DVD.
Lou Ferrigno  &  Bill  Bixby  are  great  in  their  roles,  as  they  go  here  &  there  &  resolve  certain  problems.  &  when  the  hulk  is  on  the  lose  trees  are  going  to  get  knocked  over,  he  can  jump  off  a  2  story  building  without  injuring  himself.  &  I  think  Lou's  body  was  just  painted  green  the  same  type  you'd  use  if  you  were  going  to  a  Halloween  party.
Awesome  show.  Now  I  can  watch  it  anytime.
What's  even  better  this  has  got  an  excellent  &  large  case  to  hold  all  the  DVD's  &  seasons.
Something  I  wish  all  of  these  TV  shows  I've  found  so  far  on  DVD  had.
Love  watching  the  hulk  bust  through  brick  walls,  &  David  was  close  to  finding  a  cure  but  didn't.",1503532800,2,988,3.802325581395349
