3881825,5,B0029XFN9O,"I've seen many reviews about this Blu-ray disc, and they say it's a big disappointment when compared to the first Home Alone Blu-ray. Well, I'll be the judge of that (of course, it's my review). Does this Blu-ray look as good as Home Alone? Nope, but it still looks very good on an HDTV. If you stand 1-2 feet from the screen, you will see a lot of grain though, but if you stay at a normal seating distance, it looks great. I compared it to the previous DVD version I have, and there is no comparison. There are simple things you can see now that you could not before like: the note given to Kevin, clear Christmas lights, and the text when Kevin uses his Dad's Visa Card. The old DVD version could not be played properly on widescreen TVs since it wasn't enhanced while the Blu-ray version is 1080p which makes a HUGE difference. The DVD version suffered with Dolby Surround 2.0 while we get DTS-HD sound on the Blu-Ray. There are no extras, but it's a good thing since this was a single layer-disc which allowed for a higher data rate on the picture quality. So, if you're wanting to get the best version of Home Alone 2 or upgrade to a better version, than this Blu-Ray version is it.",1292803200,41,1188,4.331838565022421
3881826,4,B0029XFN9O,"Home Alone 2 is a fitting sequel to the timeless 1990 classic, and this transfer on Blu-ray is great! Most scenes are dazzlingly brilliant, and the bit of grain that shows up from time to time can be virtually eliminated by turning your tv's sharpness setting down to zero. The audio options are many, and the film sounds awesome. I bought this in a 2-pack with Part 1 (which also looks & sounds amazing start to finish). I highly recommend this blu-ray!",1290902400,5,454,4.548780487804878

In fact, I'm surprised at how well it has worn the test of time. The movie is filled with great scenes and impeccable timing, sometimes approaching slapstick routines. The humor is good natured, but doesn't shy away from some curse words. Of course, Macaulay Culkin makes it all possible with his adorable acting and wisecracks (""I'm 10 years old, TV's my life"").

3881830,3,B0029XFN9O,"After YEARS of waiting for this to be released in anamorphc widescreen, it finally arrives on Blu-Ray. Quick review: The picture quality was disappointing to say the least. Not necessarily the Bluray transfer, but there is an INSANE amount of film grain in several of the scenes. Very annoying if you care at all about picture quality. My step-children who are 12, 11, and 8 asked me if something was wrong with the disc, that's how bad it was. Buy at your own risk. It was good just to watch the movie again after not seeing it for several years.",1261008000,2,547,4.48
3881831,5,B0029XFN9O,It's about time this wonderful movie got released properly. I can finally watch it on my widescreen LCD TV. The older DVD release was non-amamorphic and looks awful on widescreen TVs. Too bad Fox never re-released. But it's good to finally see this on Blu-ray...enhanced for widescreen TVs and with excellent picture and sound. The remastered DTS 5.1 sound is excellent. The Blu-ray version looks A LOT better than the DVD. This is one Blu-ray release that was worth the double dip. And just in time for the holidays too.,1258934400,4,521,4.8

3881836,4,B0029XFN9O,"A good movie but I feel they phoned it in at the end. They were just like okay, we've had enough let's just put a bow on it and release. Fun worthless fact: Joe Pesci is a notoriously foul-mouthed actor. Casting him for a role in a children's movie was to say the least controversial. He wasn't allowed to swear for the movie or in general so he came to a compromise. Every time you see Mr. Pesci grumbling, mumbling or spouting gibberish, that's his way of swearing without saying it on camera.",1507593600,2,495,4.333333333333333
3881837,5,B0029XFN9O,25 years later this is still one of my all time favorite movies. I can watch this any time of the year and still enjoy it. Not many sequels can claim to be better than the first but this absolutely tops the first Home Alone. Always a hilarious no matter how many times I have seen it. Home Alone 2 is definitely a family classic. I love that this comes with deleted scenes as well. It's awesome to see how much was originally meant to be in the movie.,1505779200,,451,4.078651685393258

3881866,3,B0029XFN9O,"My favorite of the Home Alone movies I grew up with both. The video and audio look and sound great. There are three spots it jerks almost like a skip. It was the first time I played it from a new copy. It's lacking special features. I could have rented the netflix or Redbox disc for the lack of special features. Two trailers from Home Alone 2 and 3, scene and language selection is about all you get. I also own the first one on boy ray whoppong with special features and no slips. This needs a new release with special features. Also interview the president elect Trump who has a cameo. They need to do a tribute to Tim Curry his health now is terrible. Get some old tapes while they filmed this. The only plus about this set is the New copies give you a paper for a digital copy for your Vudu, ITunes or Google account. The code is still good. 12-11-2016 If you buy this used from an amazon seller you may not get that. Ask and look at their feedback.",1481414400,,955,4.167567567567567

3881870,1,B0029XFN9O,"20TH century fox have reissued Home alone 2 on blu-ray again
but no new extras like new retrospective featurette with Macauley or Daniel stern
nothing new at all
all century fox did is recycle the film and the original Theatrical trailer & add new sleeve artwork for the case
plus they've added a DVD Disc of the film, so Disc 1 is the 2009 blu-ray & Disc 2 is DVD version of the film
which i think is a Dumb idea most people today watch Blu-ray quality now not the old dvd Discs
so if you already have the 2009 blu-ray, then don't waste your money buying this new 2015 reissue
as i said no new extras just the usual Theatrical trailer
there's some brainless people at 20th century fox thinking there going to make more money by reissuing the film as barebones version
pretty stupid thinking
5 stars for the film, 1 star for this new blu-ray reissue cause it's recycle of the 2009 blu-ray that's it",1480377600,3,898,4.351190476190476

It starts out OK, but about ten minutes in, it becomes grainy. There are entire scenes in which everything is grainy, and there are others in which certain parts are grainy.  The scene in which Kevin first speaks to Mr. Duncan is strange, because shots of Mr. Duncan look like I'm watching it on an old portable from the 70's via antenna, while shots of Kevin are clear. I didn't try out the  DVD, but fortunately, we have VUDU, so I just streamed the digital HD copy, and the quality of that is fine.

Well when the lady starts to sing the song I can hardly hear her singing it cause the tune of the song is really loud and the lady's singing voice seems like it's just background noise which you can barley hear.

3881914,5,B0029XFN9O,They rarely play this movie during the holidays (mostly the first one). It was worth the money and the quality is so much better on blu ray.,1358899200,,140,4.222222222222222
3881915,2,B0029XFN9O,"I bought Home Alone and Home Alone 2 at the same time and the same place. Home Alone is a great Blu-ray movie. Home Alone 2 is a bad copy of a DVD original. Grainy, sounds a little hollow or having a slight echo. No extra materials whatsoever, so you get the movie and that's it. The DVD in widescreen format is as good or better than this Blu-ray. However, highly recommend Home Alone on Blu-ray.",1356048000,4,397,4.2368421052631575

3881918,5,B0029XFN9O,The 1st and 2nd Home Alone movies are like THE BEST Christmas movies in my opinion. Could watch them over and over and over without getting tired of it. The blu-ray version looks great and I can see lots of details I never could see on my old VHS tapes. Glad I could find it on Amazon because I couldn't really find the blu-ray of either one in stores near me.,1351468800,,360,4.084507042253521
3881919,3,B0029XFN9O,"Home Alone 2 may as well be a remake. That's how close it follows in the footsteps of the original. It's a formula starting with the McCallister family going on Christmas vacation and ending with them celebrating elsewhere after reuniting with Kevin. This time he gets left at the airport, which sends the family to Miami and Kevin to New York City. He's alone again, if one can ever be alone in New York City, but he's not at home, so the title no longer makes sense.

Once you realize you're basically watching Home Alone again; different details with the same basic plotline; you start to anticipate the one entertaining part; the part where The Wet Bandits, now known as The Sticky Bandits, fall victim to Kevin and his booby traps. Even though you know how everything's going to end-up, that climax does not disappoint. It's still fun to watch those two idiots become real-life Looney Tunes characters before your very eyes.

3881920,3,B0029XFN9O,"So a spoiled 1% brat decides to torture two poor 99% men that have resorted to burglary as a last means to provide income. Rather than call the police and tell them he is lost and let them know the location of the burglars, he goes on a spending spree in New York, eats pizza in a limousine before preparing an elaborate set of traps involving repeated pummeling with bricks and heavy tools, spilling paint and varnish on skin, electrocution and setting fire to the poor men with kerosene. Then he has a chat about the importance of trust with a homeless person and feels good about himself. Pretty bad life lesson.

They should make a sequel where he is grown up in the Army working as a prison guard on the night shift at Abu Ghraib.",1322265600,10,735,4.364963503649635
3881921,5,B0029XFN9O,"A lot of people out there seem to not really like Home Alone 2, but happily I do! I was 10 when this movie came out and now I'm 29 and I still enjoy it as much now as I did then, but maybe for nostalgic reasons now. This movie was ragged on for being even less plausible, more cartoonish, having more amped up violence and well being pretty much the same as the first movie just a different locale. And I guess I understand now being an adult all the problems with the movie, but for all of its faults there is just as many funny and warm moments which for me cancel out the problems. You can complain about a lot of things in this movie, but just sometimes it's better to let go, have fun and enjoy a Christmas movie. Plus I get great joy seeing bricks being thrown at someone's face lol",1321833600,,788,4.0576923076923075
