8139806,4,B000HIVIKG,"In typical Amazon fashion, the Region 2 information is incorrect.  This is a Region 0 DVD, it will play in any player.
As far as the concert here is a quick review.
Full screen, most likely was recorded on videotape.  I'm not super picky about video quality, this picture isn't great but I'm satisfied.  It is not HD and will never be.  It is what it is, if you're a diehard fan of CC then buy the DVD.
The sound is good, a rough mix in my opinion.  Not polished, no 5.1 here.
I bought it new for less than $10, well worth it.  Check it out.",1466553600,,541,4.009345794392523

8139808,5,B000HIVIKG,"I have this concert on VHS tape and it is an amazing show, I was so looking forward to getting this on DVD when I heard it was being released BUT! it is only available as a Region 2 DVD, meaning it will only play on DVD players in Japan, Europe, South Africa, and the Middle East, including Egypt, so just beware of this before you decide to purchase it.",1162339200,2,354,4.071428571428571
