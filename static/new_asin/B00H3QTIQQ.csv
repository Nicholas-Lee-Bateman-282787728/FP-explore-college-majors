8629563,1,B00H3QTIQQ,"If Breakout From Oppression is an indication of what Chinese suspense movies were like in the 70's I think I'll pass on them in the future.  This was a hard movie to sit through, kind of like when your stomach is acting up and you have to visit the can every few minutes  it's hard to sit still for it.

Fanda is an innocent woman sent to prison for murder.  Upon her release she is given a job at a newspaper, and she hopes to be able to start her life anew.  Someone has other ideas for her, though.  Someone is tormenting her by cutting her bike's brakes and nailing her pet monkey to the door.  If that weren't bad enough it seems like everyone treats her like trash except for the guys that want to get her pants off.  But she isn't the only one affected, the tormentor has no qualms about killing people if it serves the purpose of getting to Fanda.

As character connections are revealed and the killer comes out in full force the movie gets marginally less boring.  For the most part though this thing is so choppy with such weak scene setup (and worse dialogue) that the movie is hard to follow.  What's the point of the bullies in the prison?  I thought that would play into the plot in SOME way since they kept cutting to those shots at the beginning of the story, but it has no payoff at all.

Maybe something is lost in translation, but the acting is terrible.  When the one reporter is talking to Fanda about a murdered child neither the American voice-over actor nor the one on screen display the least bit of emotion.  It's like some casual conversation.  Yeah, right there is where the little girl in this picture was brutally stabbed to death by her mother a little while ago, and I had chicken for lunch.

The action is lame and plot holes abound.  When Fanda cuts herself with a razor the wound looks brutal, but there is not the first drop of blood nor does she seem to require a bandage.  Maybe she's Wolverine's half-sister?  And exactly how does a bar of soap thrown from across the room end up under the foot of a ladder that is sitting squarely on the ground?

Content:
Violence is sometimes unrealistically lacking in blood but includes stabbings, decapitations, and a maggot-ridden corpse. The sexuality doesnt get very far. The strong language is heavy at times.

DVD:
I got it in a pack of 50 Drive-In Movie Classics. The audio is slightly distorted with a low hum behind it.  The video is low quality.  I assume it was shot in widescreen because the proportions look weird and the sides of the image are obviously cut off. A Mill Creek logo pops up like a stalker throughout the movie.

Other DVD options are slim and easily confused with another obscure Chinese movie from the 70s. The other DVDs don't look promising but at least have the advantage of not having a logo watermark.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I'm having a hard time thinking of anything positive to say here. Oh, I've got one! The premise almost sounds like the setup of a decent suspense/thriller. Too bad they couldn't make it into something worth seeing. 1* with a warning that you are most likely not getting very good quality so don't spend much on it.",1519689600,,3145,4.445026178010472
8629564,1,B00H3QTIQQ,"Fonda Chiu (Fonda Lynn) is released from prison and goes to work right away for a newspaper with no experience. The reason she was in prison is revealed later and ties into the characters. She works with Sheena (Lona Chang) a crazy 17 year old who is jealous of Fonda's relationship with Simon (Alan Tam).

The film was poorly dubbed. The story line was simplistic and not very entertaining. Available unrestored on a 50 DVD pack.

Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1481846400,,467,4.682926829268292
