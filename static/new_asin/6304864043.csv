934906,5,6304864043,"An entertaining movie and well-acted.  It's a closely accurate depiction of a war over-shadowed by the American Civil War roughly 30 years earlier, and WW-I only 20 years later.  Led by ""Fighting Joe Wheeler"" a former Confederate Calvary General, the Rough Riders defeated a firmly entrenched Spanish Colonial army led by Spanish General Valeriano Weyler, who's use of ambush and small unit tactics took a toll on a superior U.S. force and allied Cuban ""Mambi"" Rebels.  Using well know actors in leading roles, keeps your attention on the characters throughout the film and adds credibility to the portrayals.

934944,4,6304864043,"The Rough Riders is about as good a war film as a Hollywood film can make; this is primarily because two of the character actors  (R. Lee Ermey and Dale Dye are both combat veterans) so they were able to give the director first-hand input on how to make a war film. Even with this input the film had to stay within the confines of Hollywood make-believe for a film that is acceptable to audience expectations. Hollywood will never be able to make a film that is real because any such film would have the audience running out of the theater (screaming) as fast as their feet can carry them or the other viewers would literally be scared stiff and frozen in their seats.

Because of the military expertise from Ermey and Dye I heard the actors speaking lines that only a veteran could fully comprehend, and it meant something to me that the director included these lines. Therefore I recommend this as a good war film (although there really is no such thing as A good war film.), but rather because this film gets most of the history, public sentiment, costumes, uniforms, period music and events as accurately as any Hollywood war film can. (See Wiki for a list of all the mistakes.) BTW: The only reason I can watch Hollywood war films is because I know they aren't real and I find myself picking apart all of the mistakes for every 10 minutes of these films.

I do want to take exception with one of the scenes which is a conversation between Capt. Bucky O'Neill (Sam Elliott) and war correspondent Stephen Crane (Adam Storke) about killing during war. In this scene O'Neill/Elliot calls it murder, and Crane/Storke states, with a certain amount of moral judgment, So it is murder. In reply, Sam Elliot immediately says, with all of the authenticity that his voice carries, You bet it is! This is something I can speak to because Im a veteran -- there is no comparison between what happens in war and the cold-blooded premeditated killing of another human being.

We were on patrol when my first fight suddenly began and I was so scared that I froze, had it not been for my sergeant putting his hand on my back, with his other hand pointing at Charley, and then immediate shoving me forward I doubt I would be writing this. After that I can only say that my training kicked in as well as fear-driven-adrenalin so I could function as a soldier. We did what the will-to-survive dictated and what had to be done to defend ourselves and our buddies -- nothing more and nothing less. I don't understand how a Hollywood elite writer can possibly believe that war and murder are the same and that an egotistical director could put their elitist politics into an otherwise good film.",1503792000,2,2676,4.56875

After reading Edmund Morris' 3 volume set (the first was a Pulitzer winner in 1979) about Teedie (his childhood nickname), I remembered seeing this, and wanted to see the portrayals again. Elliot, Berenger, Busey put together an interesting portrayal of one of our first false flag (not to forget, Hearst by G. Hamilton) war.  Roosevelt as Asst. Secy. of the Navy worked hard for a year to modernize our Navy and
try to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in Cuba.  This brings a good question--invasion of Cuba would doubtless at one time, before the Missile Crisis,
have been a much better war than Vietnam. Why was Kennedy so reluctant, and eventually fumbled the Bay of Pigs???? Well, you will enjoy this
DVD.  The pogroms of 1903 at Kishinev were really Hearst's first international success bringing the world to challenge the Tsar--but his role in
the Maine incident is no less noteworthy. Recommended highly.",1484265600,,928,4.935897435897436

935077,3,6304864043,"Rough Riders, 2006 film

A man opens a suitcase to look at an old uniform. It brings back memories of the Spanish-American War. They show old movies (or movies designed to look old). The battleship Maine blows up. Teddy Roosevelt speaks his mind on military preparedness. In Arizona two bandits rob a stagecoach. A group of wealthy men talk about the war. They show scenes of other men who go to war. Men are gathered to take a train ride. They show Teddy at an upper class gathering eager for war. The President gets a southern Democrat to lead cavalry troops. The military wants modern Krag-Jorgensen bolt-action repeaters. Teddy speaks about the First US Volunteers and their backgrounds. There is a gift of Colt machine guns to the Volunteers. A woman sings Garry Owen as the troops entrain for their trip to Tampa Florida. There are problems with supplies.

The troops arrive in Cuba and go into action. There are casualties. A machine gun stops an enemy charge. The troops press on. Enemy snipers hide in trees. General Wheeler orders a flanking attack. Some fire on their allies in a heavily wooded area (wrong uniforms?). The enemy retreats. The Spanish 7mm Mauser is better than the American rifle says an officer. Stephen Crane talks to a wounded soldier. The US officers plan their strategy. Malaria is a problem. The enemy is entrenched, their reinforcements are coming. Can they attack now? Why are they in Cuba? To liberate the Cubans, or to take over the sugar and tobacco plantations? They arrive at the San Juan Heights and march forward. Does one man have Yellow Fever? The battle begins with artillery fire. [Where did they get those old guns?]

Attacking the heights seems impossible. It will mean heavy casualties. The battle goes on. A wounded soldier returns from the hospital. One officer stands for a better look; a mistake. General Wheeler gives the orders to attack the heights. The enemys guns fire, man fall. [No bayonets?] Teddy keeps spare glasses in his hat. The soldiers advance to San Juan Hill. They push through the barbed wire and take the top. Gatling guns shoot at the blockhouse. An enemy machine gun is turned around. Can they operate it? There is hand-to-hand fighting at the top. Countless bodies fall. The enemy blockhouse is taken. [This victory will be used to promote the career of a politician in the near future.]

There was too much padding that extended the length of this movie. There are scenes that seem to mock Teddy. No buildings are shown, that kept costs down. Were the American troops all using bolt-action Krag-Jorgensen rifles? Were there any facts missing from this historical drama? The capture of the Philippine Islands and other islands in the Pacific was probably more important than nearby Cuba for an expanded US Navy, but this is not covered in this story. [The Rough Riders were the last troops to be raised by a wealthy man; Congress soon outlawed this option that was used in the Civil War.]",1480291200,,2963,4.803921568627451

I don't know that Gary Busey accurately played Joe Wheeler, as from what I've read Wheeler was a more quiet sort of fellow.  But, Hollywood liberties aside, it does present a well known American military action for what it was and allows the viewer to perceive the reasoning behind it, as well as motivations for personal involvement.

935260,5,6304864043,"For my 500th amazon.com review, I thought very hard about what artistic work I reviewed should carry the honor.  After this weekend, I settled on this excellent TV Miniseries, Rough Riders.  This miniseries is really one of the best movies about American History that is out there.

First, the acting is really excellent.  This reviewer is completely impressed by Tom Berenger's performance as Theodore Roosevelt.  Berenger really fits into the role of the larger than life Roosevelt and one imagines that that Great American actually was exactly like Berenger's interpretation.

Everything in this movie is carefully crafted to bring the audience to the late 1890s.  The military uniforms and period costumes excellently match the fashions of the time.  There is also a carefully considered alignment of the generations.  The veterans of the Civil War and the politics of that past conflict itself are excellently portrayed.  Indeed, we know that President William McKinley made many deliberate calculations to further unify and bind the regions of the United States during to the War against Spain.

The symbols and their expressions are well done within this movie.  The best scene with this is after the Rough Riders take the hill. Roosevelt is shown crying due to the emotion of the event.  Behind him is the fluttering Star Spangled banner of the Republic-indeed a Republic which was also a self-consciously ""Nordic"" Nation-State.  Behind the flag is a great painting on a water tower with the word ""Empire"" upon it.  It is brilliant cinematography and it perfectly captures the moment, as well as the future that Americans had in-store for themselves following the war with Spain.

The movie has a pro-American message that is completely believable and un-ironic.  I believe director John Milius really captured the spirit of the generation of Progressives who led America at that time.  Today, if one has a pro-American message it has a cold irony to it.  I believe the ""Proposition Nation"" of the NeoConservatives as well as the ""I am an American"" campaign after 9-11 which showed Mid-Eastern Saracens stating in various accents that they were ""American"" made the flag, the songs, the slogans a bit empty for the modern Americans who are descended from those Americans that showed themselves so brave in Cuba in 1898.

Finally, the Battle of San Juan Hill is really ably captured in a very exciting scene.  The wounded white and black cavalry troopers helping each other get to their regiments from their hospital is really suspenseful and interesting.  The fact that the Spaniards were so excellently armed is also shown and the true bloodiness of the battle and sacrifice is excellent.

This movie is five stars!  It history written with lightning indeed.",1440374400,,2766,5.10913140311804

935329,4,6304864043,"There's something to be said for a movie with Teddy Roosevelt among the cast of characters that Rough Riders doesn't spend the entire movie following him - that could and probably will the focus of it's own movie. So it's with a lot of credit to John Milius that Tom Berenger gives not only one of the best performances of his career but one of the best portrayals of T.R. as well. He's almost naive and buffoonish when not on the battlefield, and even then he's not free of mistakes but he never overstays his welcome. For me it was unexpected Berenger would capture that ""force of nature"" Roosevelt will always be remembered as, while also making him seem very fallible and human.  Somehow fittingly, Gary Busey also delivers a enjoyable performance, along with Sam Elliott and a host of actors with whom I'm somewhat ashamed to say I'm unfamiliar.

The pacing is a little fast at times, but as a television miniseries from the mid-to-late 90's Rough Riders is a product of its time. It seems a little front heavy, viewed all these years later without commercials. The film ""version"" spends a great deal of time building up the characters of a dozen or so men constrained to a three-hour running time.

Even so, Milius manages to build the sense of brotherhood clearly evoked by the title and tone of the miniseries. Historical inaccuracies to be expected from a Hollywood historical war movie aside, as a film it does seem to touch on the most widely-known and arguably necessary events of the Spanish-American War as it relates to the main characters. It is a film about the soldiers, so it is also unsurprising light on female roles - take that as you will given his film's primary concern with an all-male military unit.

If you have three hours to watch the feature cut of this series, I would highly recommend it to fans of westerns, adventure, war and action movies - even if you're a history buff, it's hard not to enjoy this film.",1433721600,,1941,4.6173913043478265

935364,5,6304864043,"John Milius was definitely in the groove here. ROUGH RIDERS is an excellent television movie centering on Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt who forms a volunteer cavalry regiment during the Spanish American War and leads the charge at the Battle of San Juan Hill in 1898. This is an excellent and rousing production directed and co-written by John Milius. The score by Peter Bernstein is equally rousing as is the theme composed by his dad Elmer Bernstein (THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GREAT ESCAPE, TO KILL A MOCKING BIRD). And then the performers and performances when looked back on are just the stuff you love seeing. Tom Berenger plays Theodore Roosevelt with a lot of energy and wistful humor and may be the best performance he ever gave. Sam Elliott is Captain Bucky O'Neil and as always he puts a lot of grit into his performance. Truly impressive was Gary Busey as General Joseph Wheeler, a guts and glory guy to the core.",1421193600,,939,4.802469135802469

Berenger is so good in this that the first time I saw it, I didn't even realize it was him until a good half hour into the movie. I had just finished a great biography of T.R. when I got this, so I was kinda tuned in to the historical accuracy. I'm certainly no expert on Roosevelt, but this seems to be pretty much right on the money as far as the historical aspect. As a former historical reenactor, I'm always looking at details like costuming, saddles and tack, and weapons, and this movie scores very highly in that regard. (Again, however, I'm no expert. At least I didn't see any glaring anomalies that made me yell at my television set.)

The acting by Tom Berenger, Sam Elliot and others was superb and kept your attention throughout.  Humor was injected throughout the movie at appropriate times which kept it from getting too serious.  I especially liked the portrayal of the Buffalo Soldiers and the important role played by African-American Soldiers in the fighting in Cuba reflected in the firlm.  The pain of America emerging from the devastation and division of the Civil War was touched upon thoughtfully and I loved the scenes of the troops going by train through the South with Confederate Soldiers in uniform without limbs saluting and waving at the troops.

935559,5,6304864043,"The charge of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders at San Juan Hill (not strictly accurate as we shall soon see) is both one of the best known and one of the least known events in American history. For while most people know the event occurred, few are familiar with any of the details, unlike other historic U.S. battles like Gettysburg or the D-Day invasion. Director John Milius has tried to remedy that knowledge gap with a rousing TV miniseries, ""Rough Riders,"" that gives theatrical war films a run for their money.

""Rough Riders"" is the story of the unit, a volunteer American regiment during the Spanish-American War, essentially formed by Teddy Roosevelt. The Rough Riders primarily consisted of cowboys, hunters, and other Western outdoorsmen, but the unit also included a number of elite Ivy League-educated Easterners, who proved just as tough fighters as their Western counterparts. The film takes the unit from its training days until the climactic Battle of San Juan Hill. The structure is similar to many war films: focus on the stories of a few main characters. The soldier getting the most screen time is actually a fictional outlaw played by Brad Johnson, who joins the unit to stay out of prison, initially flees combat, but later redeems himself. Although fictional, elements of his character were based on a number of real people.

""Rough Riders"" is an excellent film in every regard, beginning with a thoroughly researched script co-written by director Milius. The story of the Rough Riders is one of those ""truth is stranger than fiction"" sagas, with dozens of seemingly implausible events portrayed in the film having actually occurred. The film is studded with famous names of the time who really were on hand, including William Randolph Hearst, Stephen Crane, Black Jack Pershing, and Frederick Remington. Milius seamlessly incorporates them into the script and makes several of them, especially Crane (Adam Storke) quite memorable.

Milius has long been enamored of Teddy Roosevelt, having made Roosevelt a key character in his best theatrical movie, ""The Wind and the Lion."" So, it's no surprise he threw himself into ""Rough Riders"" with gusto. He was also fortunate to have Tom Berenger play Roosevelt. Berenger, a noted history buff, captures Roosevelt's looks and mannerisms perfectly. However, Berenger is not merely doing a Roosevelt impression; instead, it's a fully fleshed out performance of a man finding himself during combat. Berenger is aided by a solid supporting cast, including the always reliable Sam Elliott, Gary Busey (overacting like crazy, but highly effective as former Confederate cavalry officer Joe Wheeler, who was in overall charge of the brigade of which the Rough Riders formed a part), George Hamilton (as Hearst), Chris Noth, and Brian Keith (in one of his last roles as President McKinley).

What really makes ""Rough Riders"" stand out are the production details, specifically in the battle scenes. The Battle of San Juan Hill takes up the last hour of the movie, and Milius was fortunate to find terrain in Texas that was nearly an exact topographical duplicate of the actual battlefield. He also had dozens of accomplished re-enactors who played various roles as the Rough Riders, the Buffalo Soldiers (the black troops under Pershing who also fought valiantly), and the Spanish troops. As a result, Milius was able to create highly realistic large scale battle sequences without relying on CGI, and the action scenes are highly exciting. The score of the movie also stands out. The legendary Elmer Bernstein provided the rousing main theme, and his son Peter composed the remainder of the score.

What emerges most clearly from the movie is how dangerous the assault was (the Rough Riders suffered high casualties) and the valor that the men, especially Roosevelt, displayed. The actual battle had two phases. In the first, the Rough Riders stormed and captured a smaller adjacent hill, Kettle Hill. Then, they assisted the other troops in the final assault on San Juan Hill. Throughout all this, Roosevelt was in the middle of the charge, first on horseback and later on foot, and came under heavy enemy fire with the rest of his command.

DVD viewers are also treated to an excellent audio commentary by Milius and producer William MacDonald. In addition to giving viewers lots of details about the technical aspects of the movie, Milius also fills in some of the gaps that the script understandably doesn't cover, such as additional background on some of the characters and events.

I would be hard pressed to find fault with ""Rough Riders"" as a theatrical film. As a basic cable network (Ted Turner's TNT) miniseries, with the usual time and budget constraints TV filming imposes, it is astonishing. Usually, when I see a DVD with an audio commentary, I wait a few days to watch the film again with the commentary. In this case, I started the commentary as soon as the fast moving, three-hour film ended, because I wanted to experience the thrills again. ""Rough Riders"" succeeds magnificently as a Western, a war movie, a drama, and as a historical piece. The Rough Riders were one of the most rightfully celebrated fighting units in U.S. military history, and John Milius has done them proud.",1403395200,,5255,5.054209919261822

(It also has two of my favorite soldier-turn-actors:  Dale Dye and R. Lee Ermey.)  Though this story is told from the point of view of a reluctant volunteer, it stays close to historical accounts of the Roughriders formation in Arizona, training in Texas and the events that took them to battle in Cuba, including the fact that they assaulted two separate hills, not just one.  While the story barely involves the questionable origin of the war and it's lasting political complications for the United States and Theodore Roosevelt, it stands alone as a dedicated film to the men who volunteered for glory, but fought a desparate battle making a significant contribution to ending the war quickly.  I also like how the story begins with the excitement of Roosevelt and other volunteers to fight gloriously as soldiers in a war, but ends with the realities of the inglorious somberness of a meaningless war (at least to the soldiers). It sends no compelling message such as Saving Private Ryan or The Bridge On the River Kwai, but it does a fair job of relating this generation's involvement in an all too familiar story of the meaninglessness of war.

Roosevelt created ""the wildest bad-cat regiment since the Mongols rode the Steppes."" The 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment which history calls the Rough Riders underlining their charge up San Juan Hill. The always outstanding Sam Elliott is Bucky O'Neil, a former lawman, in charge of whipping the rag-tag gaggle of rich and poor, cowboys and thieves into a military outfit. Gary Busey portrays a senator and former Confederate general in another off-the-wall comic performance going after the revolutionaries as if he's still in The Civil War and battling Yankees. History tells us William Randolph Hearst really pushed the US into a war against the Spanish to boost circulation of his yellow journal newspapers. George Hamilton portrays Hearst on the scene and adding fictional flourishes to his dispatches. Written and directed by John Milius the entire production has the depth of a mega-budget feature film.

935729,4,6304864043,"The Rough Riders is a jingoistic bit of film that is both entertaining and of use in classroom instruction.  The first part of the movie is actually excellent at giving a sense of the nationalism and such things as Randolph Hearst's yellow journalism.  It fairly accurately portrays the differences in class of Americans and there is a great attempt to portray the technology, clothes, weapons of the era with great accuracy.  There are no John Wayne's in the movie.  Even TR is portrayed as a normal, flawed man.

Gary Bussey as General Wheeler, the only man to serve as a General in BOTH the Confederate and Union Armies is a bit over the tip in the second half of the show.  General Shafter is the one character that is treated unfairly.
The music score is by Leonard Bernstein and is magnificent, inspirational, and moving. It really hits the era well.  I plan to purchase it for listening in my car.

This film was originally a made for TV effort that was very under rated.  Demand for it pushed TNT into putting it on DVD.  It's not ""The Longest Day"" and we are better off that it's not.

The DVD itself is high quality in sound and picture.  Since it was a made of TV show there aren't the usual outtakes and features.  There is a version with commentary.  Personnally, I think it a waste. The movie's characters tell a compelling story.  Tom Barrenger may not be Lawrence Olivier, but his career demonstrates and incredible range of acting ability.  His TR is not academy award material, but it sure is entertaining. Likewise, Chris Noth,  Sam Elliot and slew of other stars give good depth and entertainment.  George Hamilton as William Randolph Hearst was inspired casting.

Flawed, but educational and darn entertaining.  Go Rough Riders!",1333152000,3,1749,4.70957095709571
935730,5,6304864043,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge fan of TR, so I am a bit biased.  Overall, I thought this was an excellent production, especially considering it was a TV miniseries and not a theatrical release.  You could see that the director, John Milius, is a fan of TR as well, as the movie portrays him very favorably when in fact this was a time in his life that many modern Americans would have trouble being sympathetic towards (TR was a primary motivator in beginning the war with Spain, and was pretty much what we might call a 'war monger' at this time).

The acting was brilliant overall.  Tom Berenger's TR was spot-on; I've always thought well of him despite his being stuck mostly in B movie hell, and he shows in this picture what he is really capable of.  The peculiar voice of TR, his mannerisms, Berenger was able to illustrate those brilliantly.  Sam Elliott was excellent as, well, Sam Elliott.  R Lee Ermey was a surprise choice as Secretary of State John Hay; Ermey is mostly known for his 'Drill Instructor' persona but this character was definitely Machiavellian (in other words, subtle) and Ermey pulled it off very well.  George Hamilton as Hearst was a distraction, and as yellow journalism wasn't really much of a contributing factor to the war outside of New York City his character was nearly pointless (the point being to work in his famous ""I'll supply the war"" quote I suppose).  The really pleasant surprise was the choice of Gary Busey as General Joseph Wheeler; I can't say enough positive things about this, so I'll just you watch and see for yourself.

As for the other actors, it was nice to see Brian Keith as President McKinley (Keith having played TR in Milius' earlier 'The Wind and the Lion').  This was his last film, and Milius dedicated it to him.  Keith killed himself shortly after completing this film, suffering from depression from the suicide of his daughter.

There were several other characters in the movie, and I will sum it up by saying that they were portrayed adequately overall, mostly because I want to get to my last point.  And that is: Brad Johnson.  The movie is mostly told from his POV, and his character is pretty much the classic outcast-who-finds-acceptance.  In Johnson's character we find America writ small, an upstart who is gradually accepted amongst the 'big boy' nations.  Does Johnson pull it off?  Well, sort of.  He is at times wooden, but mostly I think the issue is that this character is someone we've seen before; there is nothing new here to work with or get excited about.

Moving on to the movie itself, the production values are pretty darn good for a TV miniseries.  It suffers from the occasional obvious reuse of certain shots (mostly explosions and scenes of the enemy's forces in action) but by and large Milius brought it off pretty well.  It follows the two part formula (getting ready for war and the war itself) which we have seen before.  The battle scenes were lovingly crafted and the battleground of San Juan and Kettle Hills was recreated almost perfectly.  The few scenes and dialogue devoted to the war itself illustrate its importance in history (America, still divided after the Civil War, reunites behind its young men; also, this was when America became a first class power and signaled the rise of itself, Germany and Japan into the world stage, deposing the old imperial powers of Spain, England, France and Russia), Kudos to Milius for including this.

If I have any complaints about this movie, they are these:
1) I would have preferred to see either a movie of TR before, during and after the Spanish American War OR an ensemble movie of the Rough Riders themselves with less of the political and social events of the times to clutter up the movie.  Milius tries to do both and I think the movie is weaker because of that.

2) It would have been interesting to see the Spanish side of the conflict, as this war (so small to Americans now) was a major turning point in Spanish history.  It signaled not only the final end of the Spanish Empire, but also began a major change in Spanish society itself as Spaniards had to deal with the fall of their nation to (essentially) second-class nation status.  However, Milius ignores the possibilities here and focuses strictly on the American side, relegating the Spanish to mere stuffed dolls in uniform.",1329955200,3,4361,4.686351706036746

935744,5,6304864043,"I've known very little about Colonel Teddy Roosevelt and his regiment's drive up San Juan Hill and their other actions taken in 1898 Cuba. This movie brilliantly explains it all, from the forming of the regiment with it's backbone made up of New York's rich and pampered class, and then the Arizona and New Mexico cowboys and ranchers, and up to the final charge up the San Juan Heights. Just like Teddy Roosevelt said after the battle was over, ""It'll never be the same.""

I've also paid a great attention to the critics of this movie, and their complaints about it have been made null and void. There is plenty of action in this movie, despite some critics complaining about the character of Teddy Roosevelt himself as they were unable to grasp the idea that Roosevelt had the same type of behavior and ""arrogance"" back in 1898 as I've read about, which was played brilliantly by the actor Tom Berenger. And that same arrogant behavior made him rise from Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment to full-Colonel by request of the regiment's first commander, newly-promoted Brigadier General Leonard Wood, and then to governor of New York, and finally President of the United States for two full terms.

Sam Elliot played an utterly-brilliant role as Captain Bucky O'Neil, the sheriff of Yavapai County, Arizona Territory, as he takes command of a company of Arizona Volunteers called ""G Troop"", trained as cavalry, but having to fight as infantry from the moment they landed in Cuba. Two of the volunteers under his command, much to the surprise of the movie viewer, are two armed robbers who had just pillaged a stagecoach and with an armed posse hot on their trail, enlisted in the volunteers as a desperate means to leave the area as soon as possible, and imagine their surprise to know that their company commander is the sheriff that was following them!
Sam Elliott finds out the identity of one of the men and snarls at him, ""You soldier up or I'll kill you."" one night in the encampment. He keeps a wary eye on him throughout the movie, and you simply can't believe the former robber's luck when he turns tail and runs as a coward during a certain ambush, then stumbles upon the entire flank of what seems to be a regiment of Spaniards. The Rough Riders follow the sound of the gunfire and decimates the Spaniards' defense, giving the ""coward"" the claim that he turned the flank all by himself. Sadly, Elliott catches a Spanish bullet before the charge on the San Juan Heights, and he is killed, just seconds after bragging, ""There's not a Spanish bullet made that can kill me."" The song that he taught G Troop however, ""The Minstrel Boy"", is very stirring as the men sing it during their training and also before the charge begins.

Gary Busey was the perfect candidate for Major General Joseph Wheeler, who had been a former division commander of cavalry in the Confederate Army 33 years earlier, and while as a congressman of Georgia, is selected by the president of the United States to command all cavalry units in Cuba. Wheeler turns out to be quite the strong-hearted fellow. As he is shot out of his horse in Cuba, he gleefully reminisces from the times that he was in the same predicament in the Civil War, and several times in the movie, just like the REAL General Wheeler proclaimed, you hear him say to his son, a recent West Point graduate, ""Let's go get those DAMNED Yankees!"" He had confused his words a little, referring to Spaniards as such due to the fact that he had fought the Federal Army from Shiloh to Atlanta 3 decades earlier, and I laughed my butt off when he would talk about ""getting the Yankees on the run"" in his excitement during a campaign in Cuba. I learned later that Wheeler performed heroically enough to earn the rank of Brigadier General in the Regular Army after San Juan Hill, something that would appall most Confederate veterans that were still living!

The movie also introduces Lieutenant ""Black Jack"" Pershing, a West Point graduate of 1886 in command of the contingent of the 10th Cavalry, a unit made up of African-American ""Buffalo"" soldiers. Pershing fights valiantly during his charge up San Juan Hill on Roosevelt's flank, but he knows little about the future which will make his name known throughout America, like his promotion from Captain to Brigadier General in 1906 and later commanding the American Expeditionary Force in France from 1917 to 1918 in World War One. This movie is over 3 hours long, and simply impressive and action-packed through every minute of it! I give this movie a 10 out of 10! I've owned the movie for only 2 months, but have watched it 3 times, since it's a movie that any decent person would want to watch over and over again!",1309737600,4,4712,4.68719806763285
935745,5,6304864043,"The Spanish-American War of 1898 began as the result of the sinking of the USS MAINE, a pre-dreadnought battleship, in Havana Harbor on February 15th of that year, with the loss of 274 of her crew of 363.

Although sabotage was never proven (and has been effectively disproven using modern forensic science), bellicose Americans seeking Empire blamed the ""Maine"" disaster on the rotted Spanish dictatorship that ruled Cuba. Led by the journalists William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, the public called for retaliation against Spain. This ""retaliatory"" war gained Puerto Rico, Cuba, The Philippines, and Guam for the U.S.

Leading the chorus was Theodore Roosevelt, then Undersecretary of the Navy. Roosevelt's maternal uncles, the Bulloch brothers, lived in exile, having been instrumental in developing the Confederate Navy raiders CSS ALABAMA and CSS FLORIDA. Roosevelt, whose father had hired a substitute to fight in the Civil War so that he would not have to bear arms against his own brothers-in-law, was fixated on expiating this family ""shame.""

Taking advantage of Naval Secretary Long's one day absence due to a bad cold, Roosevelt sent orders to all American vessels to ""keep full of coal"" and to prepare for offensive action against Spain. He dispatched the U.S. Pacific squadron to Manila under Commodore Dewey, and moved the Atlantic Squadron into position to attack Cuba and Puerto Rico. Not a bad day's work.

When Long returned to his office he was aghast at Roosevelt's actions, but, under pressure from various quarters in the Government, did not countermand the orders. Roosevelt avoided censure by resigning in order to establish a U.S. Volunteer Regiment. Made up of a pastiche of Roosevelt's old school chums, East Coast dandies seeking adventure, Roosevelt's rough-hewn acquaintances from his cowpunching days, a smattering of Western lawmen, gunslingers, cutthroats, rustlers, gold prospectors, Indians and politicians, this unlikely bunch became known as ""The Rough Riders.""

Tom Berenger stars as T.R. in this TNT TV miniseries. Berenger's T.R. is a frenetic, amusing, boyish, endearing, and dynamic man. Pumping hands enthusiastically and buttonholing slight acquaintances in order to expound loudly on a protean variety of subjects, Berenger's T.R. is a bit klutzy and a bit roguish---in reality, T.R. never would have upset a buffet or jostled ladies, at least without abject, heartfelt apologies---but Berenger captures the man's unbounded energy perfectly, despite these cartoonish excesses:

""My tailor at Brooks Brothers made me this uniform Senator! What do you think of it?""
""Well, Roosevelt, I---""
""Yes, I do think it is splendid myself, thank you!""

A good deal of this film focuses on the training of the Rough Riders, carried out by a fair but unrelenting Captain Buckey O'Neill, onetime Sheriff of Prescott, Arizona (actor Sam Elliott reminds this viewer of an axe handle), who has to take this disparate group and meld them quickly into an effective fighting force. We follow the Rough Riders from Texas to Florida and ultimately to Cuba, where they begin to face the privations of war---bad food, tropical heat, land crabs, Yellow Fever, Malaria, gunshot wounds and artillery barrages. Although there were ""only"" 400 American battle deaths in this war, about 2,700 more lives were lost to illness and accident, and the film does not hold back from showing us this fact. Roosevelt the ""warmonger"" is seen several times dazed and horrified by the true face of war.

The battle scenes at Las Guasimas (an extended firefight) and Kettle Hill/San Juan Hill (a full attack under intense fire) are not overly glorified. Many good men---in fact most of the American deaths in the war---died bloody deaths in these two engagements. The Rough Riders are shown pinned down under enemy fire, constrained by bad communications, poor command strategizing, and conflicting orders to hold their position under the enemy's cannons. The Spanish did not break. When Colonel Roosevelt decides to seize the heights it at first seems impossible, but the momentum of his charge takes the Rough Riders to  heroism, victory and fame; it was this heroism, victory and fame that ultimately took T.R. to the White House.

THE ROUGH RIDERS is polished and well-done, and despite its Made For TV quality, sheds light on a nearly forgotten episode in American history that brought America into the 20th Century as a World Power.",1307923200,5,4448,5.252112676056338

935749,5,6304864043,"This is a sleeper of a movie.  The quality is superb for a low budget TV movie.  John Milius did the filming in and around San Antonio, TX.  In historical fact, some of the recruiting for the U.S. 1st Volunteer Cavalry (Rough Riders) was done in the bar of the Menger Hotel that's right next to the Alamo.

No doubt that much of the story comes from Theodore Roosevelt's own 1899 book ""The Rough Riders"".  Many of the characters in the book are a composite or are transplanted into ""G"" Troop.

Roosevelt's regiment was larger than its movie counterpart; however, Milius tried to make his movie as historically correct as possible and he succeeded.  This was made excedingly difficult by ""the suits"" at Turner Network Television who kept arguing costs (while the movie was on-site and filming) and a patch of bad weather.  All things considered, the whole production was shot in a little over two months -- that's fast and doesn't allow much room for error.

The big battle for the San Juan Heights before the city of Santiago is the high point of the movie.  It was shot on a ranch in Texas that had two hills that were almost perfect replicas of Kettle and San Juan Hills.  The actual amount of ground the actors had to traverse to get from the ""American"" to the ""Spanish"" lines was nearly the same.

Millius was very good at finding the guns and gear of the battle.  One of the truly rare pieces is a 37mm Hotchkiss revolving cannon -- like a Gatling Gun on steroids -- whose owner is shown shooting it in the film.  The portrayal of CAPT John Parker and his battery of Gatlings is fully appreciated.  Parker came ashore with the guns (4 and not 2 as shown in the movie) but he'd not been taught the doctrine for their employment.  On his own initiative, Parker brought the guns up to support Roosevelt's Rough Riders assault and then that of the 9th and 10th Cavalry and 71st NY Infantry.  Parker's four Gatlings kept the Spanish forces pinned dow so American troops could close with the enemy.

One thing that's funny to watch are the German Maxim machine guns used by the ""Spaniards.""  These guns are actual antique Maxims.  But, the Maxim gun was designed for right hand feed -- yet these guns magically change from right to left to right to left.  Maxim guns were never made in left hand feed, so the cutting room reversed the film.  Ooops.

This is a rolicking good movie with excellent characterizations.  Sadly, it was also actor Brian Keith's last film.  He was dying during the filming and passed away shortly after the shooting wrapped.  I give this a 5-star rating.",1291420800,3,2579,4.552173913043478

The Spanish had no such weapon(s) in their arsenal.  The 800 man detachment of Spanish Peninsulares was armed with 5-round, bolt-action, Mauser rifles.  The COMBINED U.S. forces  and  Cuban  ""insurrectos""/""macheteros""/""mambises"" were 25,000 strong.  The U.S. forces were equipped with Model 1888 Trapdoor Springfield  .45-70 rifles, 1895 Lee Navy/Winchester Lee Rifles in 6mm, Model 1893 Mausers in 7.57mm, and 1896 Krag Jorgensen Rifles and carbines in .30-40 caliber.  This along with (4) Colt Gatling Guns in .30 caliber with 700 rpm cyclic rate, and (4)  3.2 inch/81mm cannon.  (Source:  National Firearms Museum)  Rough Riders, including the 10th Cavalry Regiment (Buffalo Soldiers) and Cuban Mambises,  outnumbered the Spanish over 25 to 1.  The Spanish garrison fired until all of its ammunition was exhausted inflicting some 1,500 dead on the American forces and an unknown number of killed or wounded on the Cuban forces.  They then negotiated a surrender to the American Rough Riders, who were on foot, and not mounted.  Even more tragic was the 5,000 American soldiers who wound up dying as a result of being bitten by mosquitos and contracting  ""Yellow Fever"".

Also present are ex-lawman Bucky O'Neill (Sam Elliott in one of his best roles), Teddy's direct superior Col. Leonard Wood (Dale Dye), a young ""Black Jack"" Pershing (Marshall R. Teague) commanding a unit of black soldiers, and the still-flamboyant former Confederate general ""Fighting Joe"" Wheeler (Gary Busey almost unrecognizable in gray hair and handlebar mustachios), plus such media types as artist Frederic Remington (Nick Chinlund) (watch for him calmly painting in the midst of a bombardment), alcoholic and drug abuser Stephen Crane (Adam Storke) (who's already known as the author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Red-Badge-of-Courage/dp/1580495869/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Red Badge of Courage</a>), and newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst (George Hamilton).  Indeed, it's the excellent cast as much as anything that makes the movie succeed: Berenger particularly has Teddy down to a T--which stands for Teeth--and Elliott as O'Neill is as calm and casual as anyone reading the Wikipedia account of his death would expect.  There's also, of course, plenty of action, especially as the Riders begin their charge up San Juan Hill (and if you don't feel like cheering when they do it, no matter whether you agreed with the war or not, your patriotism, or at least your respect for human courage and resolution, needs a boost).  Elmer Bernstein's splendid theme, and a score by his son Peter, add to the aura of the film, which is dedicated to Brian Keith, making his next-to-last appearance in a full-length film, as Pres. William McKinley (who, ironically, was to furnish veteran Teddy with a stepping stone to the Presidency upon his assassination several years later); interestingly, Keith played a Presidential Teddy in Milius's ""The Wind and the Lion"" 22 years earlier.  UPI's Vernon Scott called this ""Perhaps the best war movie ever made.""  I haven't watched enough of the genre to be sure about that, but it's certainly worthy of a look on its own merits, and should serve as a good conversation-starter with your kids regarding themes like heroism, duty, courage, and the role of the media in political decisions.",1258156800,4,3774,6.136363636363637
935787,3,6304864043,"This movie was a great re-telling of the story that defines why the name ""Rough Riders"" did not disappear from history.  For a ""war"" movie there was good character development and I really felt a lot loser to the characters.  The story itself is a triumph of the determination of men to rise to the occasion.  Very fun to watch if you are a military buff since the treatment of the equipment and battle scenes are very well done.  My biggest disappointment was the treatment of Teddy Roosevelt.  The film makes him look like a caricature or cartoon character.  Instead of a fun-loving, jolly, but determined figure they portrayed him as an obnoxious goof ball who, compared to everyone else in the battle, did not belong on the battlefield.  This was enhance by Tom Berenger's awful overacting.  I guess John Milius wanted to portray TR as a spoiled rich boy who never grew up.  Then upon being placed in the heat of battle TR suddenly transforms into greatness before the eyes of the audience.  Either way since the ending is exciting you leave feeling good about the movie but it missed greatness by the portrayal of one of the key players in the story.",1252108800,3,1155,4.617647058823529
935788,5,6304864043,"One of my favorite historical characters is Theodore Roosevelt. 'Rough Riders' is a really great film in depicting the famous battle and the the very famous man who rode from San Juan Hill into the White House. Tom Berenger does a really great job as Roosevelt. I especially like his opening scenes where he crashes the party, so to speak. Berenger really brings Roosevelt's lust for life well to the screen. Roosevelt is a historical figure I wish I could have met. Gary Busey makes a very good Fighting Joe Wheeler even though he doesn't have the full beard and the shortness the real Wheeler had. He does well though in the craziness department. Also, Sam Elliott is his usual reliable self.

Also I like the profusion of historical characters that are brought to life: the newspapermen Edward Marshall and the famous Stephen Crane among them. It's too bad that the other newspaperman Richard Harding Davis was cut out of the story but the actors bring the other two to life. I have always enjoyed Crane's narration of the battle and the line 'Any American would give an arm to see this' gets me every time. I also like Brad Johnson as the bad man turned good Henry Nash and I'm always moved by his decision to help his comrades at the Battle of San Juan Hill.

Milius depicts the decision to go to war as really being a result of the yellow journalism of the time by people like Hearst. The Spanish American war was really one of those adventures that the United States likes to get involved in that shows that it has a military and is not afraid to use it and as a warning to other countries that we will fight at the drop of a hat and usually will drop it ourselves. The film doesn't dwell on these issues but it is there in the background- the beginning of the American century.

Highly recommended!",1249776000,2,1806,4.4832826747720365

935790,2,6304864043,"Typical Milius machofest, full of boasty compadres becoming brothers in arms in a blaze of glory. If the movie is accurate, everyone at the time, from president to janitor, was nothing but a he-man; a real tough hombre with squinting eyes and an accent suitable for endorsing barbecue sauce. With so much testosterone going around, the story needs stronger bad guys to make it stick, so Milius spices the Spanish forces with some German officers. At least they had proper uniforms, not straw hats and pajamas! There's a preposterous scene one has to see to believe it: two guys in camp infirmary, one shot in the belly, the other stricken with malaria, talk themselves out of their stretchers to run and charge San Juan Hill all the way to the top among their buddies, while a news correspondant in rapture turns into a sports anchorman and starts delivering a needless account of the battle right in front of us.

As for Teddy, Tom Berenger apes him bigger than life, up to a Rufus T. Firefly impersonation. Brian Keith, who portrayed Roosevelt more convincingly in another Milius epic (""The Wind and the Lion""), appears briefly as President McKinley, although he doesn't look like him at all. Francesco Quinn plays the token Mexican desperado, complete with headband and mariachi garb, so the Hispanic audience has someone to cheer for (Why not a Cuban patriot? Beats me!).

All in all, a good choice when there's no football on TV, you've grown tired of ""The Dirty Dozen"", no one wants to play poker, or the wife has left you for good. If you're on a date, though, it's either a test of true love or a definite NO NO.",1246579200,8,1620,4.680701754385965

935792,5,6304864043,"The Rough Riders is another in the Turner series of historical films, this time featuring the adventures of Teddy Roosevelt and the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry (The Rough Riders) in the campaign for Santiago, Cuba.  While not completely accurate as to events and timing, the movie is excellent in that it gives you an incite into the personalities of the men involved.  Most of the characters are drawn from real life people and as an historian it is interesting to see if you can recognize past and future men of history.

The Spanish American War had a powerful effect of uniting the country in light of the bitterness of the Civil War and Reconstruction periods.  In watching the movie you see how the people of this country come together in a united purpose, as one people regardless of past associations.

The Rough Riders, as a group, were a typical a mix of Americana.  There were the Madison Avenue rich kids who will go on to becomes the captains of future industry, ex-Confederates who like nothing more than a good fight, the outlaws of the wild west, the local county sheriff who trains them, the typical pioneer homesteader and town merchant, Indians from the Sioux and Apache nations, along with Mexicans and the black Buffalo Soldiers all who volunteer to serve in the great adventure in Cuba.  Gone are the racist ideas, the hatred between north and south, rich versus poor.  They are one command, one people, one nation bound together in service to country.  Those of us who have served in time of war will recognize this bond instantly as we remember it all our lives.

The movie is special in that there are no special effects, no CGI graphics.  It's all real as portrayed by living history historians dedicated to realism and accuracy of details.  The movie stars Tom Berenger known for his role as Longstreet in the Turner movie Gettysburg.  Some say his portrayal of Roosevelt is a bit comedic but that is the way Teddy was...brash, overreaching and opinionated.  I found it to be genuine and well done.  Even though this movie is 3 hours in length it is well worth the time spent experiencing this little known part of history.

935854,5,6304864043,"1997's ""The Rough Riders"" was originally broadcast as a two-part television movie.  Its exceptional quality and compelling story have given it a long afterlife, first on VHS and now on DVD.

The United States went to war with Spain in 1898 over the status of Cuba, a Spanish colony in rebellion.  Theodore Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, was one of the most outspoken advocates of war against Spain.  Once the war was underway, Roosevelt put his money where his rhetoric had been and helped organize a volunteer cavalry regiment for the anticipated campaign in Cuba.  The regiment, thanks in part to Roosevelt's recruiting efforts, was an unusual mixture of cowboys, desperadoes, Ivy League athletes, and some old sweats from the Regular Army.

The movie follows the Rough Riders to Cuba, where they fought dismounted for lack of transport to move their cavalry mounts.  The Rough Riders would distinguish themselves in the assault on the Spanish lines outside Santiago De Cuba, in the famous charge up San Juan Hill.  Roosevelt's leadership of the Rough Riders was the making of his political career.  He would become, successively, Governor of New York, Vice President, and President of the United States, and would receive a posthumous Medal of Honor for San Juan Hill.

The movie is extraordinarily well-cast.  Tom Berenger is pitch-perfect as Roosevelt, with his boundless enthusiasm making up for a lack of military experience.  Gary Busey is priceless as General Wheeler, an aging former Confederate officer who commanded the U.S. expedition to Cuba and occasionally forgot who he was fighting.  Chris Noth has a brillant cameo as one of the Ivy Leaguers, quoting Shakespeare's ""Henry V"" during the famous charge.  Sam Elliot does his standard stalwart turn as Bucky O'Neill, one of the officers who helped whip the regiment into fighting trim in time for the move to Cuba.

The movie also did a good job of including the 10th Cav (Buffalo Soldiers) who did play an important role in the Cuban campaign and the role of William Randolf Hurst in the media exploitation of the Cuban revolution.  Last, there are several scenes that demonstrate the role the Spanish-American war played in beginning to close some of the regional divisions which remained from the Civil War.

935862,5,6304864043,"Rough Riders was a surprise. Did not know much about the life of President Theodore Roosevelt, and knew little if anything as to the events that lead Americans to fight for the independence of Cuba, during the Spanish-American War.

As a Cuban American, I loved watching this film, seeing the efforts of valiant men, willing to give up their lives in search for freedom for a country, just 90 miles away. At some point during the movie, there is a philosophical interchange amongst the characters, where they discuss the reasons that have compelled their actions. They say they are fighting to see fellow men free, but that some think it is all in search of the self interest of a nation that wants Cuba for its sugar. This presented the never ending argument of men sacrificing their lives for ideals, only to be ridiculed by envious people, not willing to sacrifice, and yet ready and willing to put down the efforts of others.

At any rate, it was awesome to know that Theodore Roosevelt was the inspiration behind the war that freed Cuba from the grasps of Spain, but it is with regret that we did not get the same support during the Bay of Pigs, and continue as a nation to be under the grasps of a tyrant, Fidel Castro Ruz.

The movie does a great job in highlighting the 1st US Volunteer Calvary Regiment as a group of heroic men consisting of rich and poor IVY league athletes and leather tough cow pokes, polo players and thieves coming together under the leadership of great men, one Theodore Roosevelt, to overcome and conquer the freedom and independence of Cuba against Spain.

Americans take much for granted when it comes to their heritage, but watching this film gave me the pride of knowing that when I chose to become an American Citizen, I was joining a nation of the land of the free and the home of the brave!

Thanks to this film I now know a bit more about one of the greatest presidents of the United States of America.",1176854400,16,1943,4.524216524216524
935891,5,6304864043,"I was really surprised at how good this film was. I was expecting the kinda so-so made for cable stuff that is watchable but not exceptional. This was a whole lot more.

Other people have written some great reviews here. I just want to underline one thing.

Tom Berringer's performance as Teddy Roosevelt was very good. At first I didn't even know it was him. Then when I knew it was him I still was like, I cant believe its Tom Berringer. He really nails the eccentric personality of Roosevelt, and he does it in a way that honors that great Presidents memory. I think this is one of the best performances of his career and when you think about who he was portraying and how great that man was, Berringer nailing it like that shows he was the right man for the job.

The whole cast does a great job, with standouts from Gary Busey, Sam Elliot, and even George Hamilton.

If you like historical films, you should like this one.

Teddy Roosevelt was one of the best Presidents we ever had. Its a shame so few people today have any clue about him.",1175040000,12,1045,4.338461538461538

A footnote is that the firearms used in the movie are authenic to era and some to include the machine guns were probably actually used in the actual battle.,1173571200,5,321,4.696428571428571
935893,5,6304864043,"During these most troubling times, when so much in our nation appears to be going so terribly wrong and we are infiltrated and surrounded by Fifth Column ""special interest"" groups, weak-minded/mealy-mouthed liberals, treason mongers, cowardly, gutless politicians, hoardes of illegal alien invaders, and engulfed by overwhelming mediocrity and the stifling, crippling effects of nation-killing political correctness, there are, every now and again, memorable venues that offer us a brief glimpse of just what this country USED to be made of.  ""Rough Riders"" happens to be one such venue!!!  Now, if you are a proud, true-blue, red-blooded, 100% American who loves this country, then this film is a MUST-OWN.  If you DON'T fit into this category...well, I would say that you shouldn't waste your time and you can stop reading my review right now. You're certainly not gonna see lib-losers like Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon, Danny Glover or Jane Fonda here...no way!

Not being much of a television watcher, I missed the original showing of ""Rough Riders"" (which aired on TNT way back in July of 1997), and it was only by chance that I happened upon the DVD early last summer while doing some shopping at a local store.  Already being somewhat of an amatuer military historian and  serious Theodore Roosevelt admirer from way back, I immediately bought the DVD, took it home and watched it that night and...WWWWWWWWOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!  It had been some time since I had stood up and cheered while watching a movie, but I certainly did so that night!  To say that ""Rough Riders"" was a hard-charging clean breath of fresh air and uplifting would be an major understatement!  Amidst the endless sleeze, slime, filth, crud and garbage that oozes endlessly from out of the Hollyweird sewer these days, this glittering gem somehow managed to emerge, albeit, without much publicity (doesn't surprise me at all...given the bold, uncompromising, no-nonsense and entirely pro-conservative/pro-America message that this film broadcasts loud and clear).

Tom Berenger does an outstanding job by literally transforming himself into the one and only Theodore Roosevelt, and without a doubt, this stellar performance is probably the high-water mark of Mr. Berenger's entire career...at least for me it is!  Tom brings Old Teethadore back to life in such a vibrant, energetic and larger-than-life (yet very human) performance that after just a few moments, one actually believes that it IS the real Theodore Roosevelt on that screen!  Many kudos to Tom for getting this role so right. Of course, Mr. Berenger is surrounded and ably supported by a host of other highly skilled and talented actors, such as Gary Busey, Sam Elliot, the late Brian Keith and even Geoffrey Lewis shows up as well (it's been quite awhile since I'd seen him)!  KFI radio talkshow host and military advisor, Capt. Dale Dye, USMC-Ret., is also featured and all put forth exemplary and commendable efforts in this made-for-TV production that really should have been a major theatrical release!  A correspondingly heroic and memorable musical score by stalwart western/action-adventure composer, Elmer Bernstein, compliments the film perfectly (by sheer luck, I managed to acquire a copy of the soundtrack...now long out-of-print...from a friend of mine - thank you Mr. Ripley!).

Furthermore, I have already corresponded with Capt. Dye about his involvement in the making of ""Rough Riders,"" thanking him for not only his excellent performance, but for his technical accuracy in getting so right the period uniforms, weaponry, etc. (yes, just as with any other movie production, there are a faux paus and technical discrepancies to be found in the historical timeline and in a few other areas, but set against the totally upbeat, powerful, forceful, feel-good-about-being-an-American projection of this total kick-butt winner, who the heck cares!), but I also wish to send my most heartfelt thanks to conservative director, John Milius, for not allowing the self-proclaimed socialist, Ted Turner, to step in and use his Left-wing influence to ruin this excellent and long untold story about these gutsy American heroes that, unfortunately, have been all but forgotten by so many today...TR and his heroic regiment of Rough Riders (or more correctly, the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry)!

THIS is film-making at its very best - the way films SHOULD be made and if he were still with us, I'm confident that the great John Wayne would have approved as well!  Yep...you can forget all of that multi-culti and homosexual cowboy trash that the morally defunct libs try to push down our throats via the Academy Awards.  I have watched ""Rough Riders"" at least eight times since buying it, and it has been a tremendous joy each and every time!  Buy ""Rough Riders"" ASAP...trust me, you won't regret it!

935896,4,6304864043,"As Roosevelt himself might have said, I was dee-lighted to learn that this made-for-TV movie was getting its long overdue transfer to DVD.  I remember when this aired originally on TNT back in the late 90's.  Being a huge TR buff I was shocked to here that Tom Berenger was playing the lead role.  I really could not picture him as TR.  However, from the movie's beginning, a recreation of one of Roosevelt's speeches at the Naval War College, I was floored.  And I remain impressed to this day.  I never see Berenger in this movie, not one bit.  All of it is TR.  Tom Berenger is to be applauded for his attention to detail, particularly the voice. But not only the voice -- the mannerisms, the walk, the eyes, and of course, those teeth.  I have head a few people comment that Berenger appeared to portray a somewhat cartoonish version of TR.  But no, this is Theodore Roosevelt done about as well as Theodore Roosevelt would have played Theodore Roosevelt.  The scene that really does it for me is towards the beginning, at a formal dinner function when TR is still trying get his regiment assembled.  He is so full of energy that he virtually cannot control himself.  Making it a point to talk to everyone, telling them his point-of-view (in full detail), running into people in between, and never letting the fact that his opinions are ill received by some deter him from letting it all hang out.  Almost clumsy, not because he was uncoordinated, but because he possessed what could almost be described as too much energy.

The other characters are good, actually very good, but they don't quite mirror their historical counterparts to the degree that Berenger does.  Sam Elliot's version of Bucky O'Neil appears to be in his late forties or early fiftes and remarks at one point that he is ""Getting to old for this sort of thing.""  We are also told  when we first meet his character that he has killed 30 men.  In fact, the real life ""Buckey O'Neill"" was only 38, was never recorded as killing anyone, and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, not the little plot that we see at the movie's end.  Still, he was an Arizona Sheriff (from Prescott, not Sidewinder), who was in charge of one of the regiment's groups, and his line, ""the Spanish bullet is not made that will kill me"" is a least based on Rough Rider folklore.

Other characters are equally enjoyable.  Gary Busey has almost too much fun playing General Joe Wheeler, a leftover Civil War General who fancies the Spanish as next generation Yankee troops.  While he mentions that he too is getting old early in the film, he looks much younger, thicker, and less bearded then the real-life Joe Wheeler, who looks to be very old and frail in surviving photos from the Spanish-American war.  Also there is Brian Keith playing President McKinley.  Keith looks nothing like TR's predecessor and probably acts like him even less.  His role in the film is obligatory -- he played TR in an earlier Milius Film, the Wind and the Lion.  Still, he is fun to watch in his role.

This film takes an interesting approach to telling the story of Roosevelt's volunteer calvary in that a large part of the story is told from the point of view of a semi-fictitious character named Henry Nash.  I say semi-fictitious because although history reports there was a Sgt. Nash in the regiment, he was an Arizona School Teacher and not a Stage Coach Robber.  According to legend, the real life Buckey O'Neill captured a group of bandits known as the Canyon Diablo train robbers (that part is fact) and one of the bandits, William Sterin, joined the Rough Riders under a different name and was killed on San Juan Hill.  In this film he survives the siege of San Juan Hill and is a better man for his experience.

There are those who have been pretty hard on this movie for not being step-to-step with history and accuse John Milius of taking too much of an artistic license.  It needs to be remembered that this is not a documentary, but a movie based on historical events.  Maybe some historical points do get stretched, but while the Spanish American was was brief, it still takes some doing to put its highlights into a 4 hour movie.  Particularly one that is so enjoyable to watch.  All of the names, places, and primary events important to the story of the Rough Riders are present, most importantly, the eternal Theodore Roosevelt. One does not need to be a history expert or a TR buff to enjoy watching this movie.  In fact it would be an adequate introduction to the Spanish American war for anyone looking to start studying that period in American history.

The only thing keeping me from giving this DVD a 5 star rating is the video quality and the lack of extras.  For as long as this movie took to get released onto DVD, one would have hoped for a better image quality.  I realize that this was made for TV, so I was not expecting an anamorphic print, but a thorough restoration/re-mastering would have been nice.  There are a few scenes that look very nice. But there are several that struggle to look fair, and a few that look like out takes from an early 1970's western.  Extras would also have also been a welcome addition.  There are plenty of TR documentaries and other material (I would love to hear Berenger talk about becoming TR) that could have been put onto a third disc that would have made this a stellar package.  Still its great to have this finally release on DVD, so I'll keep my gripes to a minimum.",1171238400,8,5472,4.5625
935897,5,6304864043,"Finally a war movie about the Spanish American War. The acting was great and it looked very accurate in detail. Especially, Tom Berenger did a good Teddy Roosevelt. I never really knew how the Rough Riders really got started, the movie showed how. I really liked how Gary Busey as General Joe Wheeler, who was a Confederate general during the Civil War, still called the troops ""blue bellies"".  He gave a good performance. Also this was Brian Keith's last performance. If you like war movies or even westerns, this is one for your collection.",1168300800,3,542,4.76595744680851

I have read every book on the Spanish American war, including the book Theodore Roosevelt wrote himself, and it is sad that such a well researched series gives in to inaccuracies and stoops to propaganda. What I am referring to is the depiction of German Advisors to the Spanish troops. There is not one word about advisors in any of the books, on the contrary, Theodore Roosevelt speaks of a German Count(German Attache) very well and that he was a ""good man""! That the movie lowers itself to not so nice a human trait is disappointing.",1166400000,5,658,4.53781512605042

One reviewer complains about this as unheroic, but a thorough rummaging of the histories will bear this out. TR started life as a sickly, skinny, asthmatic child and a large part of him never forgot that. Occasionally, the facade would come down and that kid would appear with a look on his face that said ""Holy Mackerel, look where I am now!""

I was very impressed that the man was not turned into some sort of mythic character; as a fallible man, he's mythic enough. Nice details abound throughout this film and I sensed it was one of the best-researched film histories ever attempted. The cast is superb, and the directing unobtrusive.

935915,5,6304864043,"My favorite war  movie is Ted Turner's ""Gettysburg"". Many of my reasons for liking it so much apply to ""Rough Riders"": Historical accuracy, a sense of being there, good actors doing good jobs portraying people who actually lived and thus capturing a sense of the times back then.

I do not know how I missed it's television release, except for my deep dislike of commercials, but when I saw that Tom Beringer was cast as TR, and saw that the price was so right, I was hooked.

I have now watched it three times, and expect to view it with my sons over the holiday weekend. Two viewings were with neighbors who are combat vets. All liked it as well as I.

It matched my recollection of historical events, but to check the details, I went to G.J.A. O' Toole's ""Spanish War"" (still available here). Yep, there was a ""Bucky O'Neill, a William Tiffaney, a Hamilton Fish, etc., and they died just as portrayed. Yes, the ""Wall Street members"" of the actual Rough Riders did think of themselves as a ""Patrician Class"" destined to run the country (whether that attitude has persisted is outside the scope of this review).

But that's history and this is a movie, and for me it worked seamlessly. Beringer captures the essence of TR very well, and  as another reviewer noted correctly, the rest of the cast does as well. The photography is just tremendous with a crisp, clear picture. There is some surround sound (athough I could not find the details on the box), because bullets and shells travelled through my sound system.

The dialogue for that time period was accurately illustrated, along with the style of clothes, visuals, and type of weaponry.

 Although most things were accurate about this movie, I thought that the ""heroic"" Teddy Roosevelt was portrayed as an idiot.  He didn't seem too intelligent and didn't seem much of a hero to me. The way he talks, walks, and held himself looked like a mockery on Roosevelt.

They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.

This movie is a refreshing bit of optimism and national pride, in a time when it is ""fashionable"" by self-proclaimed ""enlightened"" critics to disparage America's national heritage. This negative and dysfunctional trend has gotten quite tiresome, and its about time someone made a purely patriotic film such as this!

There will probably never be another statesman like Theodore Roosevelt, truly one of the greatest American presidents ever. Theres a reason his face is on Mount Rushmore.

The opening scene of this movie features his 9-March-1898 speech to officer-cadets. This speech is EVEN MORE pertinent to our times, RIGHT NOW, than it was over a hundred years ago!

Being a man of action, Roosevelt resigned his position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy to form his own Army unit when America went to war with Spain. Having lived out West for several years as a rancher in North Dakota, Roosevelt realized that cowboys would make an outstanding volunteer cavalry unit. The average cowboy was skilled at riding, marksmanship, and survival, making them ideal ready-made soldiers. Adventurous men from all corners of the United States joined Roosevelt's cavalry: not only cowboys, but college students, Native-Americans, professional athletes, and veterans of previous military service. Regardless of their status as a cavalry unit, they actually fought as infantry in most of their battles in Cuba.  The brotherhood and cameraderie of this unit of ""Rough-riders"" was real and legendary, and they fought quite well as foot-soldiers, especially in the capture of heavily fortified Spanish installations on Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill.

The war with Spain was the beginning of America's rise as a world power, and Roosevelt was there from the start! Being a man of destiny, ...he TURNED THE PAGE OF HISTORY! His part in that was originally small, but history would eventually witness him playing the greatest role in America's rise to prominence. Never forget that even the  most obscure and common man who DARES to take that leap into the unknown, ...sometimes finds himself standing triumphantly upon the heights. At this point he is no longer a common man. Indeed, he may fall hard at times, while taking that leap, ...but he picks himself up, and strives again and again if need be. THIS is what it means to be American!

Americans must NEVER FORGET that they are supposed to be Cowboys, ...or Minutemen, mountainmen, or pioneers. We ARE the cavalry that comes to the rescue. Nobody else is going to do it. Its going to be a much darker world if nobody does.

This film portrays a time when Americans realized exactly who they were, and what they were capable of. We are a light in the darkness.

In our time, we have a signifigant number of home-grown internal dissenters who exploit and benefit from everything America has to offer, ...yet they take every opportunity to rub filth on OUR nation's honor. These people contribute NOTHING, ...and they have EVERY INTENTION of bringing this nation DOWN from within.

When I am outraged at the latest disgrace that these least of all people inflict on our country, ...I watch this movie, and realize its time to ""cowboy up"". What would the Rough-riders do? ...Its time to take San Juan Hill!",1160438400,2,3333,5.021739130434782

The film does have a wonderful cast of actors, and that drew me to the story. Gary Busey was terrific.  Sam Elliot, George Hamilton and Chris Noth were all very good and believable in their roles. Illeana Douglas as Mrs. Roosevelt was wonderful.

My problem was with the way that Tom Berenger played the part of Teddy Roosevelt.  He portrayed Roosevelt as a bumbling idiot.  I can't believe that Berenger, who usually does a good job, got so off track with the part of Roosevelt.  He tripped over objects; he bumped into people and even knocked them out of the way when he was in a hurry. Yes, I believe that Teddy Roosevelt was a man of action, but this depiction was an insult to his memory.  Roosevelt was essential to this story and I was not able to enjoy much of the movie because his part was unacceptable to me.

I do enjoy movies and know that poetic license is a way of life for movie makers and I understand that; however, I find it unforgivable and offensive to mislead the audience when showing a real person. In this period of our history, children and adults don't read as much as they did in previous times.  Unfortunately, a lot of information is learned and accepted because someone saw it in a movie.

935963,5,6304864043,"Got this double-disc DVD version of Milius's 1997 made-for-tv epic just in time for the Fourth of July and have watched it three times since. Found it fit right in there with my sit-at-home-on-the-Fourth-and-watch-patriotic-movies agenda (accompanied by some good food chomping), which included: Yankee Doodle Dandy , Patriot Games, How the West Was Won, Sands of Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal Diary, The Fighting Sullivans,

Saving Private Ryan, The Green Berets,Casablanca, Fort Apache, and Gods & Generals.

  This film is just superb. It is a marvelous piece of Americana brought brilliantly to the small screen by Milius

and company, and a piece of film-making that should absolutely have been released theatrically (although that was unlikely to occur, given the liberal media's...and its distributorships...disinclination to let the nation view anything ""jingoistic""...their smugly denigrating and derogatory term for anything patriotically pro-American, or, particularly, pro-military).

  In it's cinematography, overall vision and composition,

costuming, direction, sound engineering, special effects, and,

certainly in its editing, Rough Riders is a class act of a film that has all the look and feel of a major studio release during the 1950s (albeit with some saltier dialog and situations at times than a 50s product would exibit). Some of the photographic compositions in some scenes are just brilliant. There is also a reticence here to go in for ultra-graphic violence, either in the slo-mo splatter style of Sam Peckinpah, or in the 'vip-vip-vip-WHAP' verisimilitude of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"". There is violence here, and blood, and gore, but Milius doesn't wallow in it. He visually acknowledges it, briefly, and then moves on with the sweep of the story.

  It has been commented on elsewhere by others that the depiction of German advisers to the Spaniards, as shown in the film, was ""a bit much"" historically, and, I have to say, I can't find any reference to such in anything I have read, so I suspect this is something to be relegated to the realm of ""artistic license""....aka ""Hollywood Humbug""...but it WORKS in the movie. Milius MAY have been using these Germans and their

artillery and machineguns to ""pre-sage"" or ""foreshadow"" (in literary terminology) the connection between this war and the next war that was to come (World War One). Provided a ""mental linkage"", if you will.

  There is a tremendous sense of HEART to this movie. It

plays true to battle-engendered comraderie in a way that is both exhilirating at times, and melancholy and bittersweet at others. Milius's achievement in this respect gives us a film that comes very, very close to....and perhaps even equals...the

legendary John Ford in the ""heart"" department.

  If one has ever been in the Army, there are names in this movie that immediately snap you to attention. Gen. Leonard Wood is there, and many a ""troopie"" took their basic training at Fort Leonard Wood (aka ""Fort Lost-In-The-Woods in the State of Misery""), Missouri. Lt. John J. ""Black Jack"" Pershing is there, leading the 10th Cavalry. 20 years later, as a general, that same Pershing would lead the American Expeditionary Forces ""Over There"" in WWI. On the civilian side of things, the well known war correspondent and fiction writer, Stephen Crane (""The Red Badge of Courage"", and ""The Upturned Face"") makes an appearance, as does painter Frederick Remington and (truly) jingoist newspaper Baron William Randolph Hearst (played with spot-on 19th-century ""entitlement arrogance"" by George Hamilton).

  Performances in this production are excellent. Tom Berenger virtually IS Teddy Roosevelt. Brian Keith, in his last role before his death, delivers a convincing President Wm. McKinley (this was a bookend situation with Keith and director Milius---22 years earlier it had been Keith who'd played ""TR"" in Milius's

""The Wind & the Lion"" with Sean Connery and Candace Bergen).

Gary Busey is ""something else"" as cantankerous old ""Fightin' Joe"" Wheeler, former CONFEDERATE cavalry general, now ""back in harness"" as a...gasp!...YANKEE general...leading the Cavalry units of this expeditionary force. The real Wheeler was always considered a ""character"", and Milius evidently decided to have some fun with those aspects of the old general's personality and have Gary Busey play him ""larger than life"" in every sense of the word---physically (Busey was a lot taller and heavier than the real deal)---AND with more colorful eccentricities.

(Hollywood...particularly Walt Disney...has ALWAYS tended to go ""larger than life""; Leslie Neilson as the ""Swamp Fox"" was a

big, strapping fellow, while the real Gen. Francis Marion was

a much smaller individual---a situation replayed again when Disney had big Tom Tryon playing ""Texas John"" Slaughter,another somewhat ""sawed off"" historical personage).

Sam Elliott plays real-life Arizona cowboy/sheriff ""Bucky"" O'Neill---whose actual last words (before a Spanish bullet cut him down) were ""There's not a Spanish bullet made that can kill me"". Elliott gives a strong version of his patented folksy tough-guy persona here, one always popular with movie audiences.

One actor unkown to me, Marshall Teague, plays a rough-'n-ready ""Black Jack"" Pershing, and does it marvelously. This is a guy you could SEE people following up a hill into battle.

If the character approximates the real man, you can well understand why Pershing (who later chased Pancho Villa in Mexico) was America's choice for forces commander in the First World war.

  The cast is filled with familiar faces; Buck Taylor, Brad Johnson,Chris Noth, Francesco Quinn (my GOD, but this man looks like his father, circa 1940s), Geoffrey Lewis, and others, and one and all get a chance to show their acting chops to commendable effect.

  Even as a two-disc edition, the ""special features"" here are a bit sparse. One would have thought that a documentary or two on the ""Splendid Little War"" in general, and a ""making of"" feature might be present, but, no, what you have to settle for is a running discussion/commentary by John Milius and the producer, which---while both informative and entertaining---still leaves you feeling there could still have been something else.

935965,5,6304864043,"Being an idolizer of Theodore Roosevelt and a Spanish American war buff, Rough Riders has been on my ""Top 5 War Movies Of All Time"" list ever since it came out.  That's not to say that it doesn't have some historical inaccuracies, but what movie doesn't?  I'm not a big fan of Ted Turner's politics and personal touch that he likes to throw into his movies, but what saved Rough Riders was Director John Milius (Red Dawn!).  A gun totin', cigar smokin' conservative at heart, he saved the film.  His connections with reenactment and weapons collector groups brought period weapons into the film to give us all a glimpse of what it was like.  The technical effects of war produced by Esparza-Katz (same guys who did Gettysburg) were also superb.

From the day Rough Riders aired on TNT, I was hooked.  I picked up the VHS at my local PX in 1998 and have probably watched the movie three dozen times since.  I was starting to fret when I noticed that production of the VHS had stopped.  I even transferred the movie onto a DVD because I knew a VCR would inevitably eat the tape.

God himself couldn't describe my reaction when I saw that Rough Riders was to be released on DVD; I was ecstatic.  The day it came out, I went and bought it at my local Best Buy (MUCH better retail distribution than I was expecting.  You can pick this movie up at basically any electronics store.)  Though I would've liked to have had some subtitles (as some of the script is hard to understand at times), the crisper picture and sound enhancements over the old VHS clearly make up for its shortcomings.  The director/producer commentary is also very educational.",1150761600,7,1641,4.5563139931740615

Nonetheless, this is well worth the money for anyone interested in military history (as long as you keep in mind Hollywood's liberties with reality).

Berenger's roll as Teddy Roosevelt is the core of the show, and he does a fine job.  Sam Elliott and Gary Busey have significant roles, and both do well.  Busey may be a bit over the top compared to his real-life counterpart, but it's great on film!  Brad Johnson's character shares the screen time with those two, but is a bit harder to believe.

The action footage is very well done.  It's good at keeping the viewer in tune to what's going on without having to stop the battle with dialogue between characters just to inform the audience.  The final battle scene is very long, yet it maintains a good pace throughout.

The lead up to the invasion of Cuba is also very good.  We get a good feel for the men that made up the Rough Riders.

This is also a very good movie for those interested in the gap between the American Civil War and the First World War.  How it was influenced by one, and would influence another.",1149379200,4,1226,4.5181818181818185

935970,5,6304864043,"As a history professional you have to lower your filters to watch any ""Hollywood History"".  By movie standards, this one is superb.

Berenger's Roosevelt has the manic energy, the mannerisms, and the undeniable heroism of the man. Details from T.R.'s Brooks Brothers tailored uniforms, to his difficulty with ""command voice"", are captured perfectly and used to good effect. Leonard Wood is done very well, too.

Gary Busey clearly has a lot of fun as former Confederate Joe Wheeler - done as an inaccurate caricature closer to Foghorn Leghorn, than to the actual ""bantam rooster"" who commanded the Rough Riders AND the Buffalo Soldiers in action.  Busey is about a foot-and-a-half too tall for the role, and adds a tad too much comic relief for a soldier who truly deserves more credit than Roosevelt for the prosecution of the campaign. Still, as entertainment his performance is great.

But it's Sam Elliot who really shines.  He's better here in history than as a Louis L'Amour character - he's a hard-bitten Western sheriff turned volunteer soldier, a cross between his Western roles and his ""We Were Soldiers"" performance.

The inclusion of German advisors among the Spanish - with machineguns, no less - was an annoying fabrication, particularly when their absence from historical accounts was justified by having Rough Riders shoot them after surrender - a jarring, utterly unjustified moment explicable only by a broad media consensus that every war must have features of Hollywood's version of Vietnam.  But now I've listed everything in this movie that bothered me - and it's a very, very short list.

936005,5,6304864043,"Milius did an excellent job with this TNT production of Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders at 1898 Cuba's San Juan Hill. It is Americana at its best - maybe something we need to view at this time of turmoil.

The story shows an aggressive yet thoughtful Teddy Roosevelt as assistant secrtary of the Navy, pushing for America to step out onto the world stage against European incursion in the Americas.

Tom Berenger portrays an excellent Roosevelt, leading, not ordering, his men into the attack on the well-defended Cuban heights of San Juan. Sam Elliot is also excellent as the rough-edged former Indian fighter and frontier sheriff, Bucky O'Neil, who, as a captain, takes over a company of Rough Riders and teaches them some uncoventional warfare. Gary Busey plays one of his best roles as former Confederate General and current US congressman Joseph ""fighting Joe"" Wheeler . The list of acting luminaries is almost endless, all providing fine performances, regardless of how small their part, including veteran Brian Keith as the ill-fated President William McKinley.

The story is a gut-wrenching look at the Rough Riders in training and under fire, becoming a determined fighting force, ready to achieve their objective and attack uphill against overwhelming fire superiority and well-emplaced positions.

It also portrays then Lieutenant ""Black Jack"" Pershing and his fighting Tenth US Cavalry, an all Black unit, which also fought at San Juan Hill beside the Rough Riders and took part in the victory.

Well worth the price and well worth reviewing a portion of the life of one of America's greatest Preseidents, whose order was not just ""attack,"" but was, ""Follow me!""",1145491200,4,1673,5.136029411764706

Every aspect  of this film , from its beginning to its conclusion, is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. On a personal level, I have replayed it several times and will undoubtedly continue doing so.

 Stephen Crane is caracatured as a fey drunk who spouts flowery rhetoric in an unwatchable, embarassing performance.

 Sam Elliot repeats his usual grizzled-hard-bitten act that he did so well in Gettysburg. Chris Noth is good; he almost makes up for his cloying Mr. Big on Sex and The City.

 The battle scenes in this movie are of the same quality as Gettysburg i.e. excellent in a PG view of battle that seems old-fashioned after one views Platoon or Blackhawk Down.

 P.S. The Spanish-American War was NOT a harbinger of WWI; it was actually one of the last of the small 19th century wars which would end with the Italian war for Tripoli in 1911. The mass slaughter of WWI would make TR's attempt to replay his 1898 heroics in 1917 appear out of touch with reality.",1090800000,7,1026,4.5989010989010985
936014,5,6304864043,"John Milius did an absolutely amazing job of putting together a film that depicts the establishment and deployment of the 1st U.S. Vounteer Cavalry.  Milius has done wonderful justice to his longtime hero, Theodore Roosevelt, who he once said was the embodiment of everything great about America.
As Americans, we take so much of our heritage for granted.  In this day and age of our all-volunteer armed forces, high technology and limited warfare, any discussion of our heritage and sacrifice in the blood our ancestors made is neatly compartmentalized for Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.  This is a shame.
Sometimes, the people who are supposed to be leading us aren't much help, either.  Our elected and appointed officials often flounder in the face of bad press without explanation.  The end result is that no one can understand how our government can ask people to fight and die in places far away, for causes that sometimes seem to have more to do with whether or not we can maintain our standard of living than anything else. The wars we fight now seem to be fleeting events that come and go.  Tragically, the dead are gone, and life goes on without them.

In his various career incarnations as Governor of New York, the Secretary of the Navy, and as President, Roosevelt was always one to inspire controversy.  As a Lieutenant Colonel assigned to the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, he was no different. To Roosevelt, war was not the drudgery of hell on earth, but an enobling excercise, one which all Americans should aspire to.  Amusingly, after one visit with Roosevelt, author Mark Twain remarked that it was easy to see the Roosevelt was ""cleary insane.""
Whether you agree or disagree, Tom Berringer is the perfect Roosevelt.  He portrays TR as a man of vision and backbone, as the sort of man who would one day forge the United States into the awsome power that it is today.  Berringer's performance in ""The Rough Riders"" is possibly the best of his career.
In 1898, the American nation was, in many ways, still rebuilding from the civil war.  For the people of America, this was the dawn of an industrialized nation, and for the first time, American industry was forging the tools that would take our Naval Forces into the twentieth century. Yet it would be twenty years before the new technology of the tank and airplane would be implemented in land warfare.  The Spanish-American war is unique in that in many respects, both politically, strategically and tactically, it was a prelude to World War One.
Without going into a plot synopsis (I'm not going to explain something you can see for yourself), I will say that the story unfolds perfectly and the direction is impeccable.  All of the supporting actors, Brad Johnson, R. Lee Ermy, Dale Dye, Brian Keith, Sam Elliott, Gary Busey and George Hamilton are superb in their roles.
Yes - this is a film that should have been a theatrical release.  Yes - this is a film that ought to be put on a two-dvd set with lots of extras.  Yes - this is a great film.
The ""Rough Riders"" was made for presentation as a made for TV film for Turner Broadcasting.  It was first broadcast in 1998, roughly 100 years after the Spanish American war.  I'll give Ted Turner credit; I don't agree with him on very much, but I will say that Turner Broadcasting performed a great service in broadcasting ""The Rough Riders"".
In a day and age where films depicting shoddy characters with even shoddier values are routinely churned out and targeted for specific demographic groups, ""The Rough Riders"" is an anomoly.  It is an inspired film.",1085875200,164,3581,4.728295819935691

Rough Riders does an excellent job of showing raw recruits being turned into fighting men in a short period of time, the comradere and loyalty that only Soldiers can understand, and the battle scenes can only be described as EPIC!
Rough Riders is also very well cast. Not only is Berenger flawless as Roosevelt, some others that were perfectly cast were Gary Busey as the half-crazy MG Joseph Wheeler, Sam Elliot as G Troop Commander CPT ""Bucky"" O'Neill, and retired Marine Corps Captain Dale Dye as BG Leonard Wood. Those who have seen war movies such as Platoon (probably Berenger's worst war flick) and Gettysburg will see a lot of familiar faces amongst the junior officers, NCO's and enlisted men. R. Lee Ermey was the only person that I felt was miscast. Instead of taking the role of one of the Cavalry Officers or Senior NCOs, Ermey instead portrays Secretary of State Hayes. Granted it keeps him from being typecast, however there are about a dozen roles more suited for him in this film.
Bottom line, Rough Riders is probably one of the best war movies ever made, and is definetely the most underrated. It is a stiring tribute to the US Cavalry and will inspire the fighting spirit of every American.",1079395200,,1464,4.591603053435114

Tom Berenger proves to be the heart and soul of this mini-series as got Theodore Roosevelt pretty well down to the teeth. I supposed since John Milius was involved, Teddy got the first class treatment. Milius directed Wind and the Lion back in the mid-1970s where Brian Keith did a super fantastic job playing Teddy Roosevelt.

The mini-series itself proves to be very entertaining as well as pretty historical. While it don't followed the history to the letter, there is enough there to be very creditable and you get involved in the characters. Gary Busey did a good job playing former Confederate general Wade Hampton and Sam Elliot can do no wrong here although I was told that historical Bucky Dent was bit more an - a-hole. I am somewhat surprised that this well crafted piece of TV have not been released in DVD format. Its about patriotic as it can get, politically correct in many ways and its a great story. I always thought TR deserves the Medal of Honor for his role in the San Juan battle. He got robbed!! (I guess he got his MoH after I wrote this review.)

The DVD version of this mini-series proves to be your stripped down version. There are not extras to speak of and only a commentary from the director which proves to be somewhat interesting. The two disk set however presented the mini-series well. The colors are vivid and clear, presentation looked fantastic to my poor analog TV. Its a considerable improvement over my VHS tapes.

The acting was all supurb. For one thing, I felt like Tom Berenger disappeared, and Teddy Roosevelt emerged -- Berenger did such a great job in his roll, I could hardly recognize him after a while! He was Teddy all the way. He had those big horsey teeth and round glasses and after a while you really couldn't see the actor anymore. He was this eccentric, hyper, lovable Teddy Roosevelt fellow, through and through. Absolutely amazing.
I also enjoyed all the costars. Brad Johnson as Henry Nash was really almost as important a character as Roosevelt. He starts out as a selfish weasley guy, and ends proving himself to be much more than he ever intended or believed he could be. A wonderful character.
Sam Elliot is always great in these kinds of movies, and this film is no exception. I also thought Gary Busey was fantastic and fiesty as a Southern General, and I enjoyed every scene he was in. Chris Noth was great as a educated ""gentleman"" who went to war to prove to himself that he could be brave.  Illeana Douglas plays Mrs. Roosevelt, and I think she was a fine choice. Beautiful in an unconventional way, and a devoted wife with a good sense of humor. All these people were very good casting choices.
Some other excellent roles are played by Adam Storke as the writer Stephen Crane -- his ""description"" of the battle to a fallen companion is stirring indeed. A wonderful scene. And it's always nice to see character actor Geoffrey Lewis (who plays a grizzled old soldier called Eli). I couldn't help rooting for Eric Allan Kramer, (or as I thought of him, ""the big blonde guy""), who plays a henpecked husband who ""escapes"" to war and finally stars living.
There were so many great people in this cast, and the story is laid out so that you get to know each one of them, and care what happens to them. You grieve and mourn when any one of them is hurt, or falls in battle.
Intermingled in with the characters and action is the history of the Spanish American war. It is so well told and directed, it is a pleasure to watch. Great direction by John Milius and rousing score by John and Peter Bernstein.

Curiously, he focuses on Theodore Roosevelt in both films and creates two of the more interesting interpretations of this famed American.  In ""Rough Riders,"" a young and very energetic Roosevelt is played by Tom Berenger (also co-producer) with both distinction and humor.  It is perhaps the definitive TR to date.  Note, especially TR's opening speech at the Naval War College and his retropsective at the end of the fight for ""San Juan Hill.""  The action scenes are typical Milius, great fun and again at times a bit over the top.  The film shifts from overly patriotic to momentary scenes that are clearly critical of American expansionism and jingoism.  Milius does make one thing clear, after these events nothing was to be the same.  This was a defining moment in American history.  Well produced, written and acted, this film could have made it on the big screen rather than television and it should be on DVD!  Certainly one of Milius' best efforts, ""Rough Riders"" is an enjoyable romp.",1031097600,150,1221,4.826923076923077
936085,5,6304864043,"This excellent mini-series (directed by John Milius) details the training and employment in battle of one of the most legendary units in American military history: the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry, better known as the ""Rough Riders"".
 Raised by then-Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, a New York aristocrat-turned Dakota Territory rancher, the Rough Riders were perhaps the most unusual of all the volunteer regiments to be raised to fight in Cuba in 1898.
Comprised predominately of cowpunchers and lawmen (with a small sprinkling of outlaws), as well as a few Park Avenue socialites, the Rough Riders went on to be employed as (next to the 10th US Regular Cavalry, one of the regiments of ""Buffalo Soldiers"") some of the most effective troops in the War. The taking of the Spanish strong point in the San Juan Heights was pivotal to the defeat of the Spanish in Cuba.
 Milius gives us a story which is equal parts western, period piece and war movie. The casting is especially masterful. Western stalwart Sam Elliott plays the commader of ""G"" Troop, Captain ""Bucky"" O'Neil, an Arizona Territory sheriff who ultimately falls victim to the bullet of a Spanish Mauser rifle in front of the San Juan Heights.
 Tom Berenger portrays Theodore Roosevelt, and we see Roosevelt go from enthusiastic amateur soldier to hardened warrior. We also see the genuine affection Roosevelt felt for his regiment of cowboys. Gary Busey is thoroughly enjoyable as Maj. Gen. ""Fightin' Joe"" Wheeler. Wheeler was a Democrat Congressman from Alabama who led the Cavalry Corps of the US expeditionary force in Cuba. More significantly, he was a West Point graduate...and had served as a CONFEDERATE cavalry general in the Civil War. His command in Cuba was seen as being a significant step in the reunification of the US following the Civil War.
 The battle scenes are well choreographed and the acting is superb throughout. Elmer and Peter Bernstein's score reinforce the ""western"" flavor of this film. My only regret (and it's a small one) is that the uniforms worn by the actors were not more accurate in detail. They retained a bit of ""Hollywood"" in watching the budget, and this shows in some of the small things (such as the hats worn by the actors portraying soldiers). Other than that, I have no complaints with this movie. It's fun, inspiring....and makes me proud to be an American, but above all else, proud to be a Westerner!
 Gotta like it when cowboys save the day....and they did historically in 1898 at a hill in Cuba....",1024012800,2,2537,4.932084309133489
936086,5,6304864043,"This made-for-tv film is a realistic, funny, inspiring, sad, & honest picture about the Spanish-American War.  This movie is actually able to romanticize ""the glories"" of war while also being brutally honest about America's hypocrisy, prejudices, & horrors of war, especially at the close of the 19th Century.
All of the performers are great, & I like the plot about a bandit from the Wild West (Arizona) who, in order to escape a posse, joins the Arizona Volunteers.  His reasons are selfish, but then, while fighting & suffering alongside others, he finds true self-respect & willingness to give, not just take, to others.  (His bandit-partner also finds this self-respect, but unfortunatelly, pays the ultimate price.)
The highlight of the movie, however, is the film's co-producer, Tom Berringer as Teddy Roosevelt!  He has usually been relegated to tough, working-class type of characters (the last episodes of ""Cheers"", ""Last Of The Dogmen""), but this movie proves that he is a capable, versatile, & talented actor, capable of both character & depth!  (This movie proves that if you as an actor/actress don't want to be type-cast, you've got to take matters into your own hands.)  My only suggestion for the film-makers is...show this movie again on TNT!  Too many people have not heard of this film & one showing in 1997 wasn't really enough.  This film is too good to be forgotten & people deserve to know about it.  (Maybe get an endorsement from teacher's associations, so it could be shown in school history classes.  With the events of the last year, this movie is especially poignant today.)
As Roosevelt would have said, ""Bully for Berringer!""",1018396800,3,1657,5.0366300366300365
936087,5,6304864043,"Rough Riders is a film that depicts one segment of the life of Theodre Roosevelt.  It is a film that is a constellation of people, some at the end of their careers and some just starting out.  It is a film that depicts the events the assault on Cuba in the Spanish-American War and the events which lead up to it and subsequent actions.  It is a film that is not about one man but a group and it is the group of actors that makes this film work so well. There are the big names, Tom Berenger, Gary Busey, an ailing Brian Keith, George Hamilton and Sam Elliott.  But there is a steller cast of supporting actors that make this ensemble work so well.
We see a young and vigerous Theodore Roosevelt, anxious to serve, leave his adminsitrative post of Assistant Secretary of the Navy to assume the role of second in command of a volunteer cavalry regiment, known as the Rough Riders.  He is there to support the efforts of the commanding officer, Colonel Leonard Wood, to mold cowboys, indians, thieves and polo players into an effective fighting body.  That Wood is able to do this so well is a tribute to his leadership and the enthusiasm of Roosevelt and the men who make up the command.  Dale Dye givesa very believeable performance of this physician turned cavalry officer.
We see the effective end of 19th century warfare, single shot rifles and large formations of troops facing each other and the introduction of open warfare and effective use of machine guns.  It was unfortunate that the military observers who were present in Cuba did not effectively report on the value of a machine gun to the British and French governments.
This film was also a major reunification of the north and south.  Gary Busey's Joseph Wheeler is tremendous, although in actual life, Wheeler was quite short and wizened.  But it is his fighting spirit that is effectively translated to us.  In times of stress Wheeler had a tendency to forget who the enemy was and refer to the Spaniards as Yankees.  Fortunately his son and aide serves as the peace-keeper for dad's mis-statements.
You see very few women in this film.  You see the men leaving their wives and girl friends to go to war, from Wood and Roosevelt to the private soldiers.  The events in Texas and Cuba are shown as almost a fraternity  and not inappropriately either.  We shouldn't make the mistake of assigning values of the 21st Century to the end of the 19th Century.  You also see an aspect of American life that is less glamerous - the segregated Army - black soldiers lead by white officers.  It may have been wrong, but that was the way it was done.  The portrayal is accurate - soldiers respecting their officers and officers respecting their men.  Officers who served in black regiments ran the risk of being seen as less effective officers than those in white regiments.  Fortunately for John Pershing, he met Roosevelt and served with him in Cuba and the latter remembered him when he was President.  One instance when service in a black regiment was beneficial.  Incidently, the black members of the Army were amongst the most experienced and skilled long service soldiers that could be put in the field.  They well showed thier skill and valor.
I could go to great length and describe all the actors and thier rolls.  Suffice it to say that space precludes this.  However, all rolls are well played.  You almost get the feeling that these are professional soldiers you were watching. This extends from the military to the diplomatic to the purely commercial as we see William Randolph Hearst encouraging military intervention by sending reporters into Cuba in advance of the Army.
This is a film that all who have an interest in American history should see.  It is as much a social commentary as military film.  It portrays the many aspects of the Spanish-AMerican War.  It shows well, the enthusiasm of men rushing to enlist and the disillusionment of some of the survivors as they return to empty homes where wives and children have left them.  It is a well made film that records a segment of our history, right or wrong, but events that happended.  It is well worth the rental fee.",1011744000,14,4147,4.653846153846154

936089,5,6304864043,"First, I want to praise the men who have reviewed this movie--their insights are inspiring in that they prove man-in-the-arena type outlooks  are still alive today. BULLY!, comrades.
I want to talk about 2 things  this movie depicts: the leadership of TR and Bucky and the technotactics of  men-against-fire.
Teddy Roosevelt realized we were at the dawn of the  machine age. He knew that if we didn't use this technology right, it would  crush the human spirit. This film shows how TR---who really was a  introverted and sensitive man, bad eyesight and all---through sheer force  of wheel and deliberate eccentric acts transformed a group of misfits into  a crack outfit. His goal was to make the human spirit central even in a  machine age, which is possible if your values nd heart are right. But to do  this, he needed a man of hard reality---Bucky O'Neil played by the  legendary Sam Elliot---who played my pen name (Sam Damon) in the epic TV  mini-series, Once an Eagle that started his career going. In life, this is  the way it works. The visionaries have to stick it all out on a limb and  they need HELP. Where will this help come from? Its up to the men who are  rooted in the reality to come to the aid of the visionaries who they know  are right, and not criticize them for not being ""normal"" but to  HELP them help us all. Even Bucky turns to a killer indian to help HIM help  train his men. It take's TR's audacity to get the men to Cuba Think of the  unit that missed the train do we read of them in the history books?), it  takes Bucky's guts to keep them alive to the final climactic  battle.
What's wonderful is that you see a transformation of TR as a  intuitive genius to a hard man of action who knows the technotactics of his  craft--he becomes ""Bucky"" but at a great cost.
Director John  Milius knows weapons effects--and this is crucial.  Facing TR is a tedious  movement-to-contact in thick woods on Cuba, and Bucky knows already the  power of the rifle and uses it. The brought-back-on-active-duty Confederate  General Wheeler, knows the value from the Civil War the need for positional  advantage to get that line-of-sight aim to shoot the enemy first and  aggressively maneuvers the Rough Riders to get it. But TR, is at a  cross-roads when he arrives at the Spanish line of defense holding the  terrain---he doesn't know his military craft enough to disobey orders and  his superiors don't understand the battlefield swept by rapid-fire rifles  and machine guns. His men are slowly cut to pieces as enemy fire builds. He  must act. Wheeler with nothing to lose, but with total confidence born of  winning experience---HELPS------tells him to go, and TR blossoms under  fire, employing his machine guns from tripods with a keen appreciation of  the need now to suppress the enemy to facilitate maneuver. On his flanks  are John Pershing's New York Black Troops who move forward under intense  enemy fire to support his advance. Together, they fire/move and take the  Spanish held heights.
This film is a must-see film for every U.S.  military person because it shows the realities of military leadership--at  some point the seasoned combat vets are going to have to ""pass the  torch"" and when that time comes, the new leaders must be ready  ------as is----to take over and become the new legends and heroes. When TR  is saddened by the loss on the hilltop after the group picture is taken,  its from the realization of the needless loss and waste that is called war  and how there certainly must be better things for mankind to do.
The  wayward cowboy who is the narrator at the end whose life is fulfilled is  the expression of this truth as was the rest of TR's life. Its too bad we  were not better ready to fight/win WWI since we had had at least 2  ""sneak previews"" of the machine gun and inter-locking fields of  fire from our own Civil War, the Indian wars and the war of the Rough  Riders.
A great film, in the top whatever group of best war films,  ever.
Show this film to others!

936090,3,6304864043,"""The Rough Riders"" was a good movie.  It is about time there was a movie made about the Spanish-American war and this group of men.
The action (battle) scenes in the movie were very vivid and realistic without  being too graphic.
My biggest complaint with the movie is the way  Theodore Roosevelt was portrayed.  The movie showed this great man as a  buffoon who fell down like a clod several times.  While Roosevelt was not a  true military officer who graduated from a military school; however, he  certainly was not the idiot that this movie portrayed him to be.
The  movie also explained the charge on San Juan Hill as a mistaken order gave  by a delirious officer.  This is more Hollywood then History, in my  opinion.
I wish the movie would have showed Roosevelt for the brave,  almost to the point of suicide, man that I believe he really was.  I think  he would have turned in his grave to see himself portrayed as a bumbling  idiot who lucked into everything.",963446400,5,968,4.540697674418604
936091,4,6304864043,"""Rough Riders"" as you might guess describes the exploits of Teddy Roosevelt's volunteer cavalry unit in the Spanish American War.  Berenger, Busey, and Brian Keith all turn in excellent performances as  Roosevelt, Joe Wheeler, and the President.  However, the movie also shows  some excellent research-given that John Milius was a writer as well as  director this isn't too surprising.  Mr Milius is a weapons collector, and  historian as well as a director.  The weapons, accoutrements, and uniforms  are all authentic for the 1890's. But what I found even more accurate were  the Victorian sentiments echoed by the characters:  at the beginning of the  movie Roosevelt makes a speech about the need for America to assert herself  on the world stage as she comes from ""warrior races""; later there  is a discussion about ""the patrician class"" needing to be  ""ennobled"" by war.  These were commonly held views at the time.  The writers wisely refrained from imposing 20th century speech and beliefs  on their characters.  Certainly the feelings that Americans had at the time  about the war would be difficult to understand if they did.  The battle  sequences are superbly done, while the movie IS about the Rough Riders, the  crucial contribution of the all-black 10th Cavalry to the Rough Rider's  success both in their early engagements and later at San Juan Hill is well  illustrated.  However, some scenes were taken right out of every war movie  ever made.  The first act is basically  look-how-this-renegade-band-of-misfits-disdains-army-discipline-to-become-an-outstanding-fighting-organization.  I doubt the army of 1898 would have tolerated this anymore than the army  of 1998.  As another reviewer commented, the correspondent's Homeric  commentary in the climax of the movie, while again authentically Victorian  in speech and sentiment, was definitely over-the-top and almost  embarrassing to watch.  Also, the musical score was at times too  heavyhanded for the scenes at hand.  Finally, although putting the William  Randolph Hearst character in Cuba was a good way to juxtapose the reality  of the campaign with what the papers were reporting, I don't believe that  Hearst was ever there, nor would he have dressed like a Victorian version  of a pirate.  That being said, it's a richly detailed, and historically  accurate story about a little-known but important war in American history.  Recommended.",954720000,38,2417,5.39622641509434

My personal favorites, beside  TR, are Bucky O'Neill, Henry Nash, Nenry Bardshar, Willian Tiffany, and  Hamilton Fish. This movie is unforgetable and can be watched on end without  getting tiring.
