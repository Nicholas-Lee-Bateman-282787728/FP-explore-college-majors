8656425,5,B00K6R0XLI,"Great quality DVD and a fun well constructed show. You might grin a bit over the tech advances between then as 2018, but Lloyd makes a great under water hero. Always liked his work, and you will have fun with this show and look for actors who have become famous since then. Leonard Nimoy, Jeff and Beau Bridges, Jack Nicholson, Anthony George from the show ""Check mate"" and underwater work done by the great Ricuo Browning ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" I have always liked this show.",1525651200,,486,4.597701149425287
