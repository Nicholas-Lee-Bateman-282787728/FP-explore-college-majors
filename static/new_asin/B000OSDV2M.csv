this is as close as you'll ever get to
seeing Stompin' Tom Connors in person!

This man has paid his dues,
he's traveled from town to town
writing songs about his real experiences
and the people he's met along the way.

He's known for keeping beat, by stomping on
a great big piece of plywood....
which is where he gets his name!

Stompin' Tom blends the traditional sounds
of country western music with Canadian folk music.
A unique combination- and the result is incredible!
It's all right here on this DVD!",1254700800,,543,4.577319587628866
8186466,5,B000OSDV2M,"This 2006 released video of a Stompin Tom Connors concert peformed at Hamilton Place,Hamilton,Ontario in 2005,is the closest thing you will get to seeing Tom in person;and you don't want to miss either!
Born in Saint John,New Brunswick but orphaned and raised by the Aylward family in Skinners Pond,PEI,Tom had a very hard younger life. He had a penchant for singing and eventually would travel back and forth across Canada with friend Steve Foote,and/or alone. It was a catch as catch can type of existence,working anywhere and at anything he could latch onto just to get by. Along with the bad he also met and experienced alot of good things and people in his travels. Instead of souring him as it would have many,he turned it around and wrote and sang about the times,the stories and about the people he encountered.
He got his first big break in the late /60s in the Maple Leaf Hotel in Timmins,Ontario,where he obtained the moniker that would stay with him through his career;""Stompin"".He made his first recordings on 45s,eventually graduating to full albums. With his blurring and back breaking constant touring from one venue to another along with his natural bent for self promotion,his career was officially on.
A fiercely proud Canadian Tom made a stand against the Country Music association in the late 70s by returning his Juno's and vowing never to accept any more until the association,among other things,changed its' tune as far rewarding those that would go south to make a living. So far it's been a stand off between Tom and the CMA,but one his fans have wholly endorsed and praised him for. As a result his records are rarely if ever played on Canadian radio(a national shame!).Tom even decided to ""retire"" in disgust for a good many years. Thankfully for all of us Tom finally returned to the stage and recording some years ago. Since then he also has become closely associated with the East Coast Music Awards as there is an award named in his honour.
Tom tours at least once a year now and continues to record and issue CDs for all his appreciative fans. This is the first concert on DVD Tom has ever released and it is a doozie. Most of his popular songs are here like ""Bud the Spud"",""Big Joe Mufferaw"",""Red River Jane"",""Tillsonburg"",""Margo's Cargo"" and so many more. Tom has never failed to please a crowd and this concert is no exception. He is in fine form and the crowd on hand in Hamilton that night was typical of any you will see anywhere;with alot of crowd interaction included.
This DVD was filmed to hopefully be broadcast on television but the CBC refused to air it. The blurb on the back asks us to see if we can find the reason;I couldn't. But this is typical of the industry which has generally shunned the man,as far as exposure goes,that would otherwise be given any other performer as a matter of course.
In spite of the odds Tom has become a Canadian legend and icon,even receiving the prestigious Order of Canada and a Doctorate of Letters,among a myriad of other awards. And through it all it is his fans which he continues to give a heart felt thanks to. And Tom,we give it right back to you.
The DVD was filmed in High Def so the picture is especially crisp,the sound is excellent and there some extras included;as we get some alone and off stage moments with Tom talking and singing sans his band;just on guitar.
This DVD is a must have for all Stompin Tom fans. I highly recommend you see Tom at least once in your life;it is an experience like no other. If you have never seen him this is as close as you will get without being there in person. Get your copy today!",1253491200,2,3613,4.611801242236025
