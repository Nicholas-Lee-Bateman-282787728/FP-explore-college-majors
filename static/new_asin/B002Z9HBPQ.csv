8384512,4,B002Z9HBPQ,"Sweet, human, funny and touching, this portrait of 5 key moments in a families life may not dive as deep as some films into the complexity of 'family', but makes up for it by reminding us that families  for all their flaws and pettiness and hurts  are also wonderful and important and, if we're lucky, full of love.

Remi Bezancon manages to make this argument without falling into too much sappiness. The acting is generally excellent, and the film has a knack for catching all those small details in our lives that eventually add up to larger, more important ones.

Not a masterpiece, but a lovely and very heartfelt and enjoyable film.",1398211200,2,638,4.669642857142857
8384513,5,B002Z9HBPQ,"I think it's a very good film: very creative and intelligent. The young director Rmi Bezanon represents a Post New ""New Wave"" of the French Cinema. Unfortunately, the film hasn't been yet transferred and translated for the US market. Too bad (or good, if you're a learner of French and have a multi-region player). Bezanon is one of the young directors to watch. He is not afraid of experimenting with cinematography, with young actors, with old-fashioned themes (like transfer from generation to generation); he is not afraid of complicated scenarios. But most importantly, he treats us - his audience -- as adults. What I particularly like is usage of English-language music score (which is very good) and English, in general, for comical effect (grunge, patch, magic fingures, etc). The acting is impeccable. Dborah Franois and Marc-Andr Grondin are both talented young actors whom, I hope, we will see more of. This is a new take on the old-fashioned themes: parenthood, relationship between siblings, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters. It covers five days between 1988 and 2000, each one seen from the point of view of a member of the Duval family - the taxi driver Robert, his wife Marie-Jeanne, and their children, Albert, Raphal and Fleur. I recommend it to all enthusiasts of the world cinema in general and Le Cinma franais in particular.",1297382400,3,1354,5.022222222222222
