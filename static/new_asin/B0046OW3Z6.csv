8417408,5,B0046OW3Z6,"Franz Moeckl gives a clear instruction on the art of Qi Gong.
I came to it when diagnosed with cancer and it helped me get through the treatments. I do the half hour practice with Franz Moeckl every morning and each time I feel calmer and refreshed.
Ram Daas's singing adds a wonderful depth to the experience.

I highly recommend this DVD.",1444867200,,340,4.483870967741935
