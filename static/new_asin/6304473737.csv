7873624,5,6304473737,"This volume is my favorite of the Evangelion series simply because it took  the time to give some of the smaller characters a little action, such as  the much-ignored but brilliant Makoto Hyuga, done by Hiro Yuki. There were  some good laughs in this volume, plus your standard Eva battle, and Misato  trying to take command. Definitely worth the money. Of course, anyone who  has seen parts of Eva knows it is beyond necessary to pick the entire  series up, and this volume is just another great contribution.
On a sour  note, the ADV dub irks me, and the fact that they only put two episodes on  a tape is upsetting because their tapes are so expensive.",962236800,,655,4.538461538461538
