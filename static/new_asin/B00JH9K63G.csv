8650811,5,B00JH9K63G,"This is truly a powerful piece of Film that must be shared and spread through universities now. It raises so much awareness on very important cultural issues in the Afro Latino world with a sensitive eye for the importance of human life in general. Very emotional. If you don't know about who are the 'Garifuna' tribe in Honduras and their long history, I urge you to please google it. This is a must watch picture no doubt about it.",1523577600,,433,4.493670886075949

8650813,5,B00JH9K63G,"Finally got to see this movie, I didn't have to read the subtitles, knowing all three languages!!! Cliff hangers, best moments of the movie (which I refuse to give away) this movie explores all sides of culture identity, struggles and history of the Garifunas to modern days!! I missed the viewings in NYC and Boston, it was worth the wait. Plus, I didn't know Mr. Alli produced the ""Espritu de Mi Mama"" which I brought almost 13 years ago on VHS, which had a cliff hanger (like what many ways the story coul d have went)...only through a Garifuna experience.
P.S. they should have had a soundtrack CD on this, all the songs especially the traditional pinta songs and reggae nuwein track by the Flores brought me back to great moments!!",1422748800,2,736,4.625954198473282
8650814,5,B00JH9K63G,"I have recommended this movie to US, Honduran, and Caribbean universities to teach about the land struggles of Afro-latin American peoples, for the study of Garfuna dance and music and the issue of indigenous language loss and 35 of them now own the movie. I thought it was of excellent quality, and I have written in online newspapers that I thought it was the tenderest love story using African American actors that I had yet seen in a movie.  I have also recommended this movie at International health conferences and in article like latinalista.com that this movie is excellent for opening the discussion of how Moms can talk to daughters about the issue of AIDS and daughters can talk to boyfriends about AIDS. This movie has won 3 awards in film festivals in the US (Boston, Houston, Tuscon) and one in Italy, and a film critic chose it as one of the best foreign films of 2013. This makes it the most decoated film produced by a Honduran. The issue of identity also is discussed in this play like is a Garfuna in Los Angeles simply American or a Garfuna American, classifying it "" foreign"" a film produced in Los Angeles  also is interesting.",1420156800,2,1149,4.627450980392157
8650815,5,B00JH9K63G,"Excellent work, good movie. I have had the opportunity to view it twice. I highly recommended and invite garinagu parents to view it with their family and children. IT is not a fiction, is real is history.",1413158400,,205,4.5675675675675675
