7979145,4,B000085EEM,"This is a short OVA with only a few episodes. Its about a man and a woman that don't do so great with the opposite sex. The two meet and fall in love. It's really simple but heartwarming. It's a good show. If you don't want to watch a long series and don't want to spend much cash it's right up your alley. It's not a great epic love story like Clannad or Suzuka, but it's cute and worth the time you put in to watching it.",1348963200,,423,3.8735632183908044
7979146,4,B000085EEM,"The manga is alot better than the anime, and from these reviews on here people don't quite understand the story.  This is basically an anime adaptation OF the manga...if you want the full story read the manga.  Anime is never the full telling of the story.",1269043200,,256,4.543478260869565
7979147,3,B000085EEM,"This was a nice anime, but pretty average in general. There wasn't anything completely spectacular about it but it is a nice buy and a good addition to a collection!",1229385600,,165,4.533333333333333
7979148,2,B000085EEM,"This could have been cute, but it was too dirty for my daughter to watch, and I really like anime that we can watch together.  It was too silly to be for adults only!",1215129600,3,166,3.8823529411764706
7979149,1,B000085EEM,"Don't get confused like I did! I bought it from amazon thinking that it was the 3 ova episodes but it was the tv series. The  dvd covers of the tv series and the OVAs are the same in amazon but actually they are different, so be sure to understand when you buy this, is the one you want.

This is the sequel to the OVA episodes and it SUCKED!!!! Poor production, graphics, story and animation. The OVA episodes were even MUCH BETTER with HIGH quality production, good animation, good graphics and CUTE story.

P.S: Buy the OVA episodes instead and pretend that this never existed.

Adios.",1151193600,2,588,4.4672897196261685
7979150,4,B000085EEM,This dvd seems to start out in between one of the last episodes of the OVA which was confusing when i started to watch it but it worked.  The episodes are roughly 5 to ten minutes long.  It would have been better to have made 2-3 episodes rather than 16 small ones but that's just how it is.  I found all the episodes to be entertaining but to be honest just a bit too overly dramatic.  Misou our lead character in this series seems to cry alot and basically is just one big idiot but most guys in his situation might act the same way.  The ending isn't what i expected and will leave some people bewildered and others like what the hell.  For myself personally i didn't like the ending but it is how it ends regardless of how much i dislike it.  Overall though i'm glad i bought it is definetly a worthy series for any collection.,1057104000,3,831,4.188679245283019
7979151,5,B000085EEM,I thoroughly enjoyed this title. The premise alone hooked me in but I was quite pleased with the execution which was surprisingly well done. Character designs where excellent in my opinion. I look forward to the TV installment that proceeds this OVA and will be released shortly.,1052352000,3,279,4.957446808510638
7979152,4,B000085EEM,"My husband and I just finished watching this.  The story is very cute, we both liked it. The two main characters are so shy that it can get frustrating, but it works out all right in the end. The animation quality is pretty good as well.  Yay! An unexpectedly good find.",1051920000,3,270,4.2745098039215685
