8016977,3,B0001WTVMA,I like Joe Penny so I am biased in reviewing this film.  I think Loni Anderson lacks emotion in her acting so I am biased in reviewing this film.  The story if there was one makes me biased in reviewing this film.,1416009600,,213,4.0476190476190474
8016978,1,B0001WTVMA,"Someone has started to kill certain people in this small town (where everyone is out to make a buck off somebody else). Beforehand, the killer calls the person and lets them know, in a whisper, that they're toast. First to go is newspaper owner Liz's partner, Jerry.  Dan Walker (Joe Penny) shows up in his old beat-up car to visit his old friend Jerry, only to find out his friend has been murdered and ""mutilated."" Dan immediately gets a job as a reporter on Liz's paper, once she looks him up in a book of reporters, and find that, among the articles he's written, is ""Reagon at Camp David."" Yes, Reagon.

Dan and Liz quickly fall into bed together and fall in love. Joe Penny is gorgeous but he and Loni Anderson have no chemistry.

How the victims were mutilated is never explained. The killer comes up behind them and stabs them repeatedly in the chest, through their clothes. I don't know how much mutilation that could do.

It is far too easy to figure out who the killer is. It can only be one of two people, and it can't be one of them because:
A. That person is not in the vicinity when it happens
B. That person does not run like the killer does

Also, if you've ever watched any old tv shows, you know who it is, by the whisper.

It is not explained why the killer takes the extreme measure of killing these people, or whether this killer also murdered Liz's father when she was sixteen, if so how? Because this killer had an alibi.",1403481600,,1445,4.333333333333333

This movie is DEFINITELY worth the price it is going for on Amazon!!",1135555200,5,224,4.090909090909091
8016980,4,B0001WTVMA,"SPY, INTRIGUE AND A LITTLE ROMANCE.  I THINK YOU WOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE.  GREAT AUDIO AND VISUAL.",1108252800,4,97,4.647058823529412
8016981,2,B0001WTVMA,Whisper Kill wasn't the best movie but it was ok. The story didn't made sence but when I watched the movie over and over again then It started to make sence. I wouldn't call this a horror movie but a drama movie. It showed  that a killer has feelings in this movie. This film was not rated but to me  it should be rated PG-13 or rated R.This movie was like the movie Scream  but a 1988 version. I reccomend if you rent this movie than buy the movie.,948672000,4,449,4.022471910112359
