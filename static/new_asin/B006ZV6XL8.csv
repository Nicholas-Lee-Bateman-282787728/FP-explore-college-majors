8507290,5,B006ZV6XL8,"absolutely gorgeous

splendid singing (the four women's voices blend magnificently), lovely acting, simple but sculpturally effective staging (the lovely conceit of the 'extra's' appearing almost totally in grey so they can perform an enormous amount of necessary on-stage work without getting in the way of the action), wonderful music beautifully played and unobtrusive camera work -  you couldn't ask for anything more, a delight from beginning to end",1411776000,4,454,5.661764705882353
8507291,5,B006ZV6XL8,"Everyone knows the melody of the ""Largo"" from Xerxes, but how many know it is an ode to a tree?  This production by the English National Opera is artfully staged, beautifully sung in easily understood English, and will delight Handel lovers who wish to go beyond ""The Messiah"".",1402012800,4,277,4.770833333333333
8507292,4,B006ZV6XL8,"The singing of Murray, Masterson and Garrett leaves very little to desire. However, the mannerism and voice quality of Christofer Robson is too much for my taste. The production is not exceptional and the customes are silly. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable work that really deserves to be obtained and watched more than once. The music is superb, and Mackerras handles it smoothly and elegantly. Despite all my misgivings, it gave me lots of pleasure.",1339027200,5,454,5.066666666666666
