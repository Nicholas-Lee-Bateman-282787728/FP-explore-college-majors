7752149,3,B01FXM75U2,"Although it was sold rated as TV-MA, it is really not much more than PG and another in a seemingly endless run of disappointments, this series had potential with attractive and likable characters and the intrigue of the foggy remembering of past lives, all thrown into the dumpster by such nonsense as: requiring the fighters to recite seemingly endless chants before they can use their full powers on the ""unbeatable"" monsters presently being engaged as if the foe will take a coffee or joint break waiting for the completion of chanting, the big-busted blonde principle assigning her 10 year old sister to move in and sleep in the same bed as the teen aged male hero, and the straw that broke the back, what little ""nudity"" there was had no nipples on the breasts,making the girls look mutilated and unattractive, not to mention something rated as TV-MA look like PG and not what was expected and paid for.
This has pretty well ended my buying anything new unless I have already watched it elsewhere beforehand. These things cost too much to be constantly disappointed over; my decades-long  obsession with spending 1000's of dollars per year essentially ended with series. I watched about half before just turning it off and placing it into long-termed storage, having no-one I would dump this on.",1475625600,12,1300,4.882352941176471

7752157,5,B01FXM75U2,"A series with an intriguing concept, notable for its outstanding handling of an overpowered character and one of the better supporting heroines you'll meet in quite some time.

In a world threatened by massive monsters known as Metaphysicals, the only protection are ""saviors"", those people who have reincarnated from their past lives from an alternate world of magic. Divided into 2 groups, those who in their past lives were masters of Shirogane, who mastered weapons and techniques, and those who used Kuroma, that is, magic, in their past lives, these ""saviors"" will need training, right?

Naturally, there'd be a high school for young people who have such an ability, and that's where our show opens, as we're introduced to our hero, Moroha Haimura, who on opening day runs into Satsuki Ranjo, who in their past lives were siblings who had crushes on each other. It seems that their relationship was one where a kiss was a huge deal with it implied that there were no sexual relations between them. At the same assembly, they meet Shizuno Urushibara, who affectionately kisses Moroha, while a shocked Satsuki is outraged, and Moroha seems to think he might have met Shizuno before. Moroha has a problem: Unlike most ""saviors"" he has very little memory of his past life. Make that past ""lives"", for he's the first of his kind, someone who has had 2 past lives, and is able to use both Shirogane and Kuroma.

The result is an instantly overpowered character. Such characters are often the bane of shows, as all too often such characters are mishandled. Not this show. World Break intelligently handles this overpowered character by giving him appropriate flaws, powerful opponents, a fun surrounding cast, and by frequently not focusing on his overpowered status. For example, at one point Moroha is out handling a series of powerful Metaphysicals, but instead of showing that action, the focus of the episode is on an all-girl slumber party.

While there seem to be a number of girls after Moroha, the two most important ones are Satsuki and Shizuno. Satsuki is your classic tsundere, prideful little sister type who has a huge crush on Moroha, and is excited about the possibilities now that they're not related by blood anymore. But the real standout is Shizuno. Busty and playful, with hilarious dry, understated humor,  Shizuno is the breakout character of the series. In her past life, she was a slave, branded with an iron on her chest as a child, but freed by the man known as the Dark Lord, Shu Saura. But she would grow up to be known as the Netherworld Sorceress. There's a reason why Moroha seems to know her, and why Shizuno is so casual in her affection toward Moroha: In her past life, Shizuno was Moroha's wife.

Shizuno's love for Moroha shines through in a mature, adult, and ideal wifely way. She's not fazed by such things as missing out on a group date with him; she'll spend that time checking out the mystery transfer student who says she's got a crush on Moroha, acting as a wife protecting her husband. We see that her faith in her past love is tremendous, and that she's patient, wanting him to remember her on his own. Shizuno has a lot of fun teasing Satsuki, winning every war of words with Satsuki, but while Satsuki is constantly bragging about how she was and is Moroha's sister, Shizuno never lets Satsuki suspect that she was Moroha's wife...with ALL that implies.

Despite giving this show 5-stars, it does have imperfections. It really needed a 2nd season, or at leat a number of additional episodes (the show is based on a light novel series which has released 14 volumes to date in Japan), to explore its story in greater detail. After Moroha establishes his over-powered status, he joins an elite anti-Metaphysical group called the Strikers, fellow students. More time was needed to flesh out these characters. The show also would've benefitted from greater exploration of the meaning of remembering your past life. Think about it: A bunch of hormonal teenage high school students who can remember their past lives to the point of having sexual relations (certainly this is the case with Shizuno), marriage, childbirth, etc. However, these characters were all heroes, and heroes sometimes die young, without any of those major experiences. The show beats around the bush on these issues, for example the show's token loli, Maaya, gained the memories of her past life at an age much earlier than usual, and clearly knows more about the ways of the world than the average person of her age. Fortunately, in  her case, it is used for humor. At one point when asked who she is, she says she's ""future harem material.""

Despite these limitations, this show is a lot of fun, and provides an interesting twist on the ""powered people in high school"" trope. It provides a great example on how to deal with an overpowered character, has a good supporting cast, and a standout female co-lead in Shizuno. Recommended.",1470614400,19,4947,4.83806146572104

7752164,4,B01FXM75U2,"- Synopsis: Our main character is a unique student compared to his fellow classmates at Akane Academy. This academy trains students to utilize various powers and abilities that belonged to them in their past lives. The main character isn't able to make use of just one former life; he is able to utilize two, making him a rare and extraordinarily gifted student. From the amount of adoration he is showered with, to the dangers of the foes he must battle, Moroha has one long school career ahead of him. Will he crack under the pressure, or come out on top?
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: There is a moderate amount of fan-service. With a slight sister-brother complex forming, which is even more awkward with the notions of former lives and whatnot. Whether it's endearing family adoration, or something a bit deeper bordering the circumstances of incest, this is something to keep in mind (since everything is subjective; you decide) if you are curious about this anime.

Anyways, for the most part, he isn't your typical anime character that is a push-over. Once he remembers his abilities, he becomes a force to be reckoned with. But, this also serves as a reminder that power comes with responsibilities. Upon awakening his latent abilities, he will shoulder the burdening task of being in the ranks of the best of the elites that take on the most dangerous missions ever known.

Personality-Wise, he's a pretty calm protagonist, can be a ditz at times, indecisive when it comes to women, but also serious and kind-hearted. As his latent abilities resurface, he becomes almost unstoppable. Probably borderline over-powered.

- Analysis: Reincarnation is one of the main principles in this anime. Generally, reincarnation involves the belief that the soul transmigrates from one body to the body of something else that is living. Unfortunately, this cannot be scientifically proven as it comes with many complications.

However, it still maintains an interesting concept and could possibly address things such as de ja vu. Which could be thought up as a memory from a past life, since it is generally understood that de ja vu is a feeling of nostalgia. Regardless, this anime revolves around an interesting and rare concept that isn't found much in other animes, if at all. This provides plenty of thought-provoking material.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 episodes on 2 DVDs with an approximate run-time of 5 hours. This is rated TV-MA for violence, and moderate fan-service.

8761750,1,B01FXM75U2,"Another anime show that crams way too much fanservice into it and also creepy incest subtexts too. The actual plot to the show is sort of interesting something involving reincarnations and a high school where they have an active force to combat metaphysicals a  monster group that seems similar to the Titans of a certain other popular show out at this time using special powers. If it actually focused on that it would be fine but the show instead gets bogged down in a lot of fanservice. The plot go's from that to suddenly introducing a international six countries group that conflicts sometimes also with our main hero and Russia sends out a teenage female assassin to do him in also prompting a huge arc where our hero literally goes into Russia to fight them head on. That literally takes up the last half of this show and it's a rather bizarre tangent before ending this show on some far more important fight with a powerful metaphysical. But again way too much fanservice time in this show, I mean if you want to be Attack on Titan fine, please try to be but oh please stop with the anime fanservice.",1519689600,,1108,4.54
8761751,5,B01FXM75U2,"The world setting and good characterizations save this from being generic and predictable. Story flows well and makes sense (if sense is applicable to a fantasy world). Probably best not shown to young viewers due to ""certain situations"" that occur.",1517788800,,249,5.25

8761757,3,B01FXM75U2,"Good show and decent encode. However, my issue has nothing to do with the show itself, but rather Funimation. They completely missed subtitling parts of the dialogue throughout the show, and I have confirmed this by extracting the subtitle file and looking at that timing. This laziness shows up as early as the first episode within the first 3 minutes of that episode (~1:12 give or take a few seconds). The issue wasn't with the video player either.",1494460800,,451,4.794871794871795
