Think of it--watching a beautiful sailboat skim across the water with sails filled to the brim with God's wind, while listening to a beautiful piece of original music whose rhythm and melody are perfectly matched to the motion of the sailboat.  If you've tried scented candles and warm baths, I promise you this is far, far, better.

8314508,5,B001K9KC30,"I am proud to have offered our family beach house for use during the filming of Dancing With The Wind.  Now that the project is complete, I am delighted to see and hear the sights and sounds of sailing.  So too, I'm glad that all of those piano lessons didn't go to waste on my son, Ed.

This is a work of art, and I am happy to have supported it and the charities that will benefit from its future success.  I hope you enjoy it as well.",1230595200,,437,3.9318181818181817
8314509,5,B001K9KC30,"This DVD gives a real feel for the freedom and beauty of being on the water ... without having to get wet. The author/composer obviously loves his boat and sailing. That love comes through in his musical compositions and the sailing footage. This is perfect for sailors, but even more perfect for anyone who wants a soothing way to look at the world and to relax.",1230336000,,363,4.515151515151516
8314510,5,B001K9KC30,"This film gives you a wonderful taste of what it feels like to be very close with the waves and the wind over the water. It is very relaxing and inspiring.

The creators of this film do a wonderful job of bringing you, the viewer, into the scene.  You can almost feel like you are ""dancing with the wind"" with the boat and the crew.",1229385600,,332,4.092307692307692
