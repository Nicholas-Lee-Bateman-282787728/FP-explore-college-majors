166838,4,0800129784,"This movie sneaks up on you.  I saw it with my girlfriend and therefore, as she saw it before many times, knew the plot.  I thought Nicole Kidman did a fine job but was miscast and could not therefore connect with many of the necessary nuances of her character and their relationship. It had some powerful things to say about family realtionships, the doctor/patient relationship, hope, forgiveness, the actual nature and expression of love, the craft and the art of letting go as opposed to the contrivances of such, and the love a man has for his family, his wife, and his child.
But all those themes, when brought together in concert with some virtuosic moments of acting, have a synergistic effect.  Michael Keaton's performance and that of the supporting cast take the power of the powerful themes they are given responsibility for and say something, do something, with such poignancy as to actually rise above the inherent weaknesses in the script and the cinematography.  They turn the movie itself into a symbol of what or who one loves and how one should love: taking all the flaws not just into consideration, but loving them as part of what makes them- and life- beautiful.  That is why, I believe, it is impossible for people not to have seen the many flaws in the movie, but still feel little need to point them out or dwell on them.  By the time this movie comes close to connecting with the major source of pain and/or crises in your personal life, you are already sold and have started falling in love with some or most of the characters.  Needless to say, when it does connect for you... I began watching the movie feeling only mildly moved (while my girlfriend cried, again), but wept quietly for about an hour after it was over (long after she was done).
A very special, poignant film.",969667200,7,1804,4.636363636363637
166839,5,0800129784,"Michael Keaton was OUTSTANDING in this movie! I cried many, many times through this film. This movie is about a man who learns that he has cancer. He videos his family and some LIFE LESSONS for his unborn child. I thought that this was one of Keaton's best films.
(. . . )Michael Keaton and the cast really show the emotions that one person may face when dealing with cancer...

166840,5,0800129784,"This has been one of the best movies for the 1990 years. Micheal Keaton and Nicole Kidman make a great couple in this romantic/tear-jerker movie. I used ""Tears on a Child"" as my review title because this movie  focuses on a child who is being born into a family whom one-of-which of the  parents are dying! Its so sad how M.K. tries to show his love for his son  as he tapes all the father things he should teach his child, sex, he  struggles on. It has a little bit of humor along with the movie. This was a  great and sad movie. WATCH IT!",944352000,3,540,4.104761904761904

166979,5,0800129784,"One of the best videos in my collection.  Quite a lesson here for those dealing with cancer and hidden emotional agendas.  Being a Reiki Master, I recognized the meanings that the Oriental Master (Haing Ngor) used in feeling the negative vibrations in the Spiritual Aura of his patient.  All physical illnesses start from a higher level vibration.  Just as the Native American Shamans do, the Reiki Masters are trained to go to this higher level and root out the cause and cure.  Michael Keaton is excellent as the patient in denial.  Interestingly, Haing Ngor, who portrayed the Oriental Doctor, was a trained medical doctor himself in Cambodia and suffered through the Killing Fields (the movie where he won the Academy Award).  Ironically, ""My Life"" was one of his last notable films as he came around full circle...portraying a doctor himself.  You may notice, as Haing places his hands above Keaton's body, that he is missing a part of one finger.  This was cut off in one of his many tortures during his capture in the Killing Fields.",1447632000,,1040,4.830508474576271

It compelled me to go back into my childhood and open up wounds and sort through family events that I played over and over like a movie but it never had an ending. This movie is like a moving prayer in action where it freely allowed me to not only relate to several parts of the movie but it reached into my soul; way out of my comfort level and for the first time in years I felt alive and unafraid. I reached out to my family and began the process of expressing my feelings and loving from my heart, something I closed up long ago. It's amazing that it took a movie to wake me up and live again. It so easy to take everything for granted, I now live in the present moment; the past is like the smile of an old friend and my future is a grateful warm hearted hello.",1447113600,,966,3.984536082474227

167004,5,0800129784,"Stellar performances thoughout.

 This is not so much a film about a man facing his death as it is about a man facing his life. As he prepares for the end, Bob Jones tries to tie up the loose ends of his past, prepare a future for his wife and unborn son and in the process, takes a voyage of self-discovery.
I have always thought that Michael Keaton was very under-rated as a dramatic actor; here, he is able to portray Bob in the beginning as unpleasant, stand-offish and angry without condemning him for it. In one of her earlier performances, Nicole Kidman does what she can with a character that has little to do beyond appearing loving and tragic. I wish more had been done with Haing S. Ngor 's character as the healer who guides Jones on his path, because his performance was wonderful. Many great character actors complete the cast, including Michael Constantine, Brad Whitford, Richard Schiff, Rebecca Schull, and Queen Latifa.
Probably the biggest problem in this film is the portrayal of Bob's cancer; he's told he has less that a year to live, but until the last few weeks of his life, he appears vigorous and only experiences an occasional spasms of pain.
But it's forgivable, or at least it is to me. Because as I said before, and as the title suggests, this film is about life, not death.",1443139200,3,1304,4.54468085106383

Some have embraced what this movie had to say and some decided never to watch it at all and so realized yet another opportunity missed.

If you are looking for similar messages, I would recommend The Five People You Meet in Heaven (Jon Voight) and Wit with Emma Thompson.  Both very strong movies with a lot to say about end of life and dying.

167186,5,0800129784,"I am a blood/cancer specialist (for 25 years), and have always been put-off by most of Hollywood's attempts to portray medical-related drama on the big screen. Scores of such attempts have always seemed to me to be overly-forced efforts to wring some emotional impact from the audience, by over-done acting and grandiose ""life-and-death"" scenes, as if everything that happens in medicine is so different from everyday life. The simple, daily human drama that I have been priviledged to witness in my work has always struck me as something that would make a much better movie than anything Hollywood has done.
""My Life"" , in my opinion, is one bright, shining exception to the rule. I saw this film when it first came out in the theatres, and just recently bought a DVD for home use- and after watching it again just last night, felt compelled to offer this review.

The story line is that of a young man (Keaton) diagnosed with incurable kidney cancer, spread to his lungs. He's a work-a-holic executive type in Los Angeles, with his wife (Kidman) pregnant with their first child. While he actively seeks out all conventional medical therapies for his disease, and continues to work (and keep his diagnosis from friends and even his own family), the disease progresses- and early on he is racked with anger and denial, aggravated by his emotional and physical estrangement from his family back in Detroit. He begins to video-tape himself, with practical (and frequently both hilarious and insightful) suggestions for living life, in order that his newborn child will know who his/her father was- hence the ""My Life"" title. The stages of disease progression are shown unsparingly and in a very matter-of-fact way, and for once in the movies, we see a patient who actually doesn't get MORE attractive, as he is dying. At the insistence of his wife, Keaton reluctantly begins to see a Chinese ""faith-healer"", and the several scenes involved with this are also rather insightful, as regards what true healing is all about.

But the impact of this movie goes well beyond the compelling and well-written plot.

First and foremost, this movie more than any other seems believable, seems real.....in no small part due to the exceptional screenwriting and acting. Though the two leads (Michael Keaton and Nichole Kidman) are clearly established, big-time movie stars, one never gets the feeling that you are watching big-time movie stars acting out a part: they say things and do things that real people do, when confronting a serious illness, and the imminent prospect of one's mortality. Bravo to the screenwriters for giving these exceptional actors believable things to say, and bravo to the actors for conveying the incredible emotions that they do, both through their words and their  body language. In most movies where there are a lot of ""tear-jerking"" scenes I get ultimately uncomfotable, but not here. Every scene in this movie, from riotous laughter to the deepest sorrow, rings absolutely true. I know, because I see and hear the same from things I am witness to personally every day.

But there's more to this movie than just the medical story- it's also a powerful story of forgiveness, and also an almost Wordsworthian tribute to the lost innocence of childhood. The flashback scenes of Keaton revisiting the home of his childhood touches so many familiar buttons, that anyone who has done the same in their life will surely be moved to tears- and tears mixed with sadness, longing, and even joy. As Wordsworth wrote: ""Though nothing can bring back the hour.....of splendour in the grass....of glory in the flower....we will grieve not, rather find.....strength in what remains behind."" The scenes in this movie about Keaton's childhood have this wonderful, longing, and lyrical quality- never melodramatic or overly-sentimental either- another tribute to the filmakers.
The Chinese ""faith-healer"" in the movie seemed to me an allegorical figure: a means to convey the ultimate truth about serious illness and death- that real healing is not of the body, but of the mind. We all die physically one day, but worse than this is the mental death we so often die daily, through the diseases of anger, denial, selfishness, apathy, and fear.

The musical score (by John Barry) adds to every scene, and is among the more poignant and lyrical soundtracks I've ever heard in a movie. I own a copy of the soundtrack, and by itself it is a moving work of art.

I give this movie 5 stars, without reservation. If you've never seen it, and even if you don't go for ""medical dramas"", see this one. You won't regret it.",1214438400,63,4611,4.957309184993532

167214,5,0800129784,"I just found this movie while hopping channels on my TV before going to bed.  It was after 11 PM when I tuned into it;  I got hooked shortly and stayed up until 1:30 AM or so to finish it, what with all the lengthy commercials on late night TV.  I started after the opening scenes, so I couldn't even tell what the title of the movie was.  I had to look it up on Google (keying in Nichole Kidman and Michael Keaton from the closing credits onscreen).

I was amazed with my reaction to this movie.  I would be supportive if it was required watching for all people.  I of course wept through the scenes of father & son reconciliation, the wonderful birth scenes with the hapless Dad almost passing out from amazement and joy, and the final glorious scenes in the end.  I felt so much more in love with my life, my wife, my family, and my God, after watching this movie.  That such a wonderful message got through the Hollywood process is amazing to me.

The movie depicts sickness and ultimately death, but it was not sad at all to my mind.  Sad at first when ""Bob"" cannot seem to reconnect to his weird and wonderful family, and when you realize the miracle is NOT going to be survival of Bob's body but eventually becomes that of survival of his soul.  Glad, while weeping profusely in the final scenes, at Bob's triumph over his fears and bitterness.  How such uplifting themes can be portrayed without offending our various religious beliefs or lack thereof is wonderful.

I plan to make presents of this DVD to all my adult children.  Some of the grandkids are old enough to appreciate it as well....",1174176000,4,1603,4.404761904761905
167215,5,0800129784,"I love movies. All kinds. But this particular film holds a special interest for me. When I first saw this movie, it was about 10 years after it was made. I had heard about the movie, heard that Michael Keaton's character dies of cancer. So I was a little reluctant to watch a movie about someone dying of cancer when I had just lost my father to the disease. The same exact form of cancer Michael Keaton's character is fighting in the movie. This particular form of cancer is not as common and highly uncurable, so naturally, I was a little surprised that this film depicted this type of cancer. But I have to say that  the screenwriter for this film did his homework and did it well. The film does an excellent job of depicting the effects of kidney cancer and the path the disease takes.

I am confident that anyone who has dealt with the fight against cancer will relate to this film, and recommend it, as do I. Even if you have never had an experience with cancer, I would still recommend that you watch this film.

So thinking he may not be around long or at all after the birth, he tapes his life for his child to look back on as they get older.  I don't think anyone in the universe could watch this dry eyed.  He goes and revisits the house he grew up in; he teaches his son how to shave; he gives all the fatherly advice to his future son that kids learn from their living parents.  It's a beautiful, heartwarming story that is acted well and will flood your house.  You must see this if you are a fan of a love story between husband and wife and father and baby.

167238,4,0800129784,"I remember seeing My Life when it came out ten years ago and thinking that it was a wonderful film.  When I purchased it recently on DVD the film itself had lost none of its poignancy.

The plot of the film has relatively few twists and turns.  At the beginning of the film Bob Jones (played by Michael Keaton) has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Jones's wife, Gail (Nicole Kidman) is pregnant with their first child, so Bob decides to start filming a series of videotapes that can be shown to the son he knows he is unlikely to ever see.

Gail eventually also gets Bob to visit a Chinese healer (Hiang Ngor), who apparently is using a mix of traditional remedies and psychology to help Bob.  This is the point where the film could have gotten extremely corny, but director Bruce Joel Rubin does not overdo the mysticism and avoids taking the easy way out by having Bob make a sudden and dramatic recovery.  The healer is essentially just a vehicle to move us into Bob's personal history and conflicts with his siblings and brother and is extremely well done.

This is a superbly acted film.  This film stars Nichole Kidman before she made Nichole Kidman films and a very versitile Michael Keaton, who was coming off of the Batman series.  Their strong performances are buttressed by supporting roles from Bradley Whitford (The West Wing), Queen Latifah (Chicago), Michael Constantine (My Big Fat Greek Wedding), Richard Schiff (The West Wing) and Rebecca Schull (Wings).  It is an extremely deep cast.

This is an emotional film and is, at the end of the day, about someone with cancer, so be prepared to be crying by the end.  However, instead of being two hours of tension, the film is crafted so that after a particularly dramatic sequence you have a section that includes some humor, mostly involving Bob's guidance to his son.  Because the end, when it comes, is not totally unexpected, you don't finish the film feeling drained; instead, the ultimate message behind the plot is one of hope and redemption.

Overall, the film is excellent if you like drama - if you are looking for a popcorn film, this may not be for you.  Sadly, there are very few extras on the DVD.  However, if you want to see a well-acted, well-written, well-acted and mostly serious film, you can do far worse than My Life.",1129334400,18,2308,4.645320197044335

The old poet , who exalted to death in the age of the irresponsible joy simply oversmiles and enjoys like any one else when a bird sings or before the perfect structure of the falling leaf and intends to

167243,5,0800129784,"""When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully"" - Samuel Johnson

Michael Keaton gives an effective and heart-felt performance as Bob Jones, a young, successful PR executive married to a beautiful woman (Nicole Kidman) who is expecting their first child.  The bottom falls out of his life when he is diagnosed with a fatal illness, and only given months to live.  He is forced to exam his life that he's really just been rushing through.  Bob Jones not only has never stopped to smell the roses; he hasn't even noticed that they are there at all.

'My Life' is a realistic portrayl of what must go through one's mind when one is brought up short by such stunning news.  Although the topic is certainly depressing, it is something we will all one day face.  This is how one man deals with the terribly bad hand he has been dealt.  Especially poignant is the fact that not only won't he probably be around to help raise his child, but he might not even make it long enough to see his child born.  Heart-wrenching.

In several pivotal scenes, Jones decides to hope for a miracle, and visits an Asian healer (Haing Ngor who starred in 'The Killing Fields') who tells him that he has too much anger and hurt in him.  Jones resists the whole notion of exploring how he got to where he is, at least for a while.  His anger at his family is one point of anger he must struggle with.

Keaton does an excellent job here.  We see flashes of the actor we saw in 'Mr. Mom' and earlier movies, sort of a lovable, good-hearted guy with a funny edge to him.  His Bob Jones evolves slowly and realistically from a man who is stunned and angry, to a man determined to let his child know who he is.  Ngor also plays the right note as a practioner who can't cure his patient, but perhaps can help him in his last journey.

A potentially maudlin, down-beat subject is handled with just the right amount of empathy and gentleness and with a light touch.

Highly recommended.  Very highly recommended if you've had such a scare, are living with a terminal illness, or have had a loved one deal with such issues.",1104883200,46,2131,4.404092071611253

Mi ingles no es muy bueno espero que me disculpen...pero queria decir a quienes lean esto que recomiendo esta pelicula de todo corazon, es hermoza, para reflexionar y llorar

Especialmente para aquellos que perdieron algun ser querido.

Keaton en acaso su mejor papel, le da un toque especial

Pero si hay algo mejor que la pelicula en si, es la musica en la que john Barry realmente sobrepasa los limites de su genialidad.

Para las lagrimas y abrazar muy fuerte a los seres queridos...porque uno nunca sabe.....Gracias",1099267200,,661,4.7043478260869565
167246,3,0800129784,"I was so looking forward to own this movie on DVD. I purchased it through amazon.ca and contrary to the description on the website, what I received was the Full Frame version only and not the Widescreen/Full version as advertized. Please be aware when ordering this title. The movie itself is awesome.",1090368000,2,301,4.8076923076923075
167247,5,0800129784,"What a profound movie.  The plot has been described by other reviewers, so I won't repeat.  All I can say is ""My Life"" is one movie that will profoundly touch you, the sign of a truly great movie.",1077148800,,196,4.131578947368421
167268,4,0800129784,"The title is enough.  This is a tear jerker of the nth degree.  Great story, with more than enough emotion infused.

167269,5,0800129784,"This is one of the few movies that makes me cry every time I see it.  My Life is depressing, honest, and beautiful, which makes it rather hard to watch.  It is also well acted and well scripted, in a rather understated way, and it takes a while to get into.  Once you get hooked, however, the movie is mesmerizing, as you watch Keaton's character's life and health disintegrate slowly.  I can't recommend it highly enough, but it certainly is not a happy, feel-good movie.",1047168000,,472,4.517647058823529
167270,5,0800129784,"This movie is very good, but I have to admit that you have to be slightly masochistic in order to watch it.  You realize just by reading the back of the DVD cover that the movie is going to be a tear jerker, and it doesn't disappoint in reaching this objective.  This movie WILL make you sad.
Michael Keaton plays a young and affluent corporate executive named Bob Jones who finds out that he only has a matter of months before he will die of cancer.  Nicole Kidman plays his wife, Gail Jones, who is pregnant with their first child.  Knowing that he doesn't have much longer to live, Bob faces the challenge of making sure that his unborn baby will know who his father was, as well as the added task of restoring his ties with his own parents and brother.  He uses his camcorder to make videos for his baby.  In these videos Bob covers many topics ranging from how to make an entrance into a room, how to play basketball, how to shave, and the obligatory discussion about sex.  One of the most touching tapes Bob makes is when he talks to his child about how to feel if Gail ever decides to start dating again or get re-married.  There are also some very poignant moments when Bob settles his anger and hurt feelings with his parents and his brother.
Michael Keaton does a solid acting job in this movie.  You'll admire the fact that he's high-strung and fights to maintain his health for as long as he can, along with the fact that he never laments his fate but simply braces for it.  Nicole Kidman is also very good in her role as a supportive wife.  Also worthy of mentioning is the performance by Haing S. Ngor as an allopathic doctor.  These ""alternative medicine"" doctors are often portrayed in movies as people who make outrageous promises, but his character was different.  I appreciated the fact that he eventually conceded that he couldn't help Bob fight his cancer, and the best thing Bob could do was to simply ""get [his] house in order"" before he died.
If you suffer from depression (like me), this movie isn't for you.  Don't watch it unless you're ready to possibly shed a few tears.  Though I hate to feel sad, I'd have to say that I enjoyed this movie very much.",1042156800,4,2180,4.415
167271,5,0800129784,"The air around me was humid and rather pasty, swirling about in thick clumps; and though somewhere in the background a fan buzzed to no end, it seemed fruitless...kind of like the movie I was watching...

  This scenerio describes my thoughts and surroundings exactly two days ago, ""how had this boring class I was taking to get AHEAD next year, sacrificing MY summer for...turned into this?""

  The movie was ""My Life.""
I give this movie 5 stars because it is beautiful. Not really a romance, not a tragedy...but the tale of humaity.
I am entering High School this year with dreams of being an Opera Singer.
My head is constantly enveloped in the clouds.....dreaming of my Met debut; yet somehow, in some inexplicable way, this MOVIE of all things, just a movie right?, snatched me, no wrenched me, from my dreams and apprehensions, and planted my feet firmly on the ground.
YOu begin watching this movie with a rather light heart...even if you know the story...for it is funny. Yet, as things progress, the story becomes so unbelievably tragic...well... All I can say is tissues...
BUT, this still does not explain why this movie had such a profound affect on me does it?? Well, I will proceed.
THere is a line in the movie ""Sometimes dying is the hard way to learn about life.""
I fell and landed on the rocks...
Having the goal of being an Opera singer is not what most would call practical...no matter how hard I work now...which I do... I worry about finances, how will I live, have a family...or will I??? Maybe I should just be a scientist like Dad?! These are my typical, frustrated thoughts...
Yet the night after seeing ""My Life"" I couldn't sleep...I tossed and turned replaying that ""wretched"" movie over and over in my head....and then I realized why...in fact the realization startled me so much I sat up...the ""message"" of 'My life' was, of all things, ""Life is just to short to not do what you love"" (now granted here the lines may differ...maybe you have already made a career...I just mean to live life to the fullest) or Carpe D...the like!
So, perhaps this interests you, perhaps not...but this is my take on the movie...
I reccomend it to those suffering with some sort of delimma (of ANY sort) for it really gives you perspective...you know...
""at least I have this or that""....
Anyway...highly recommended...VERY distrubing and sad..but well worth it...

167272,5,0800129784,"This movie helps remind the viewer that life itself is valuable. It is all too easy to get wrapped up in this American Rat race living. The story of Michael Keaton's battle with terminal cancer prompted me to begin looking inside myself for the keys to living. The Chinese healer instructs Keaton to look into his heart for the answers about his childhood pain. With all the distractions in society today, this advice seems so simple, but yet allows a person to get back to his or her simple nature. The movie is also about forgiveness and Keaton's emotional reunion with his parents had me sobbing. Men, this movie will help you to stop and smell the roses......",1024704000,2,663,4.627118644067797
167273,5,0800129784,"This movie is another one of my favorites!  The movie has purity, humor, drama, and lots of tears!  It's such a good portrayal of a terminally ill man, with a family on the way.  It clearly shows his (Michael Keaton) ""roller-coaster"" battle with his illness.  A GREAT movie to watch with the one(s) you love!",1007510400,,308,4.545454545454546
167274,5,0800129784,"Keaton and Kidman shine in this story about love, life, death, parenting, and priorities.  This is a movie that looks at life and what's really important, through the eyes of a man dying of cancer (Keaton), whose wife (Kidman) is pregnant with their first child.
In the process of coming to grips with his terminal condition, Keaton also comes to grips with his repressed anger toward his parents, and his inability to open up to his supportive wife.  He learns to let go of his anger and to face his fears head-on, strengthening the ties that bind and healing past wounds, in this touching story of one man's road to fulfillment in a life cut short by tragedy.
A very well put together comedy-drama, Keaton's acting is superb, and the scene where he confronts his parents at his brother's wedding is so real that it reverberates with authenticity.  I recommend this movie for making us stop and think about our priorities in this short life, and for showing that courage and heroism are not storybook qualities of swashbuckling superstars, they exist in the realm of real people, in everday life.",997574400,3,1097,4.7631578947368425

At the same time, Gail was pregnant with his child.  In order to let his kid know him and his family, Bob videotaped his way of way and interviewed paople who knew him.
This movie is rather sad but it shows the unity of a family in times of tragedy.  There are also moments of happiness when Bob's father finaaly kept his word about bringing a circus into the backyard of the house.  Get your hankies ready if you gonna watch this show.
