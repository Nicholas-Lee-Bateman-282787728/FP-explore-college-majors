6267896,5,B00IK49U4A,"Nice video that explains mass in terms and meanings my children get.  Have had better attention from them since watching this video, especially when they say ""MOM, that's in the Brother Francis video!"" out loud during mass.",1399248000,7,223,5.027027027027027
6267907,5,B00IK49U4A,"I bought this to watch with my granddaughter, a toddler, to help familiarize her with the Mass as I'm going to take her with me to daily Mass when I'm watching her.  It's aimed at a slightly older child, but she enjoyed it and wanted to watch it over again right away.  And there's room to grow with it and be able to explain things further as she grows in her knowledge and experience of the Mass.  It's a good, fun resource to introduce children to the Mass, and I plan on checking out the other Brother Francis DVDs on other sacraments.",1485129600,,539,4.264705882352941
6267908,5,B00IK49U4A,"So wonderful for helping younger children learn about the order and purpose of the Mass!  My 4 and 6 year old both love this short but very informative video featuring the gentle Brother Francis and his enthusiastic explanation of WHY we go to Mass and WHY we do all of the many things we do in Mass!

It's simple, accurate, and a great starting point for a tiny Catholic.  My children are both more engaged during Mass and like to follow along because now they understand (in basic terms) WHY we genuflect, WHY we pray all together, WHY we stand and sit and kneel.

Love it!  Looking to buy the whole series over time.",1477094400,,619,4.394736842105263

6267934,5,B00IK49U4A,"The Mass begins with Brother Francis vigorously ringing the Church bells and explaining that they are used to call people to Church. He then explains how the Mass is like a holiday or celebration and one that you can attend every day. Unfortunately, some of us (myself included) sometimes forget how special the Mass is and take for granted how lucky we are to be able to attend it so freely. He also tells us that ""The Mass is not just about a ceremony and a celebration. The Mass is about Someone.""

He then compares Jesus to a hero, for giving up Heaven and coming down here to die for us and our sins. We are then walked through the Mass from entering the door and crossing ourselves with Holy Water to the priest's Dismissal at the end, and reminding people to stay until the priest leaves, not sneaking out after Holy Communion. I particularly like that they included the Parable of the Tax Collector and the Pharisee in this DVD when explaining the Penitential Rite. This has always been one of my favorite parables, and is an excellent reminder that only in humility can we find true forgiveness. This is the perfect DVD for teaching your children or school children (8 and under) what happens at Mass, each part of Mass, and how to be respectful during Mass. 5 stars!",1411516800,11,1276,4.523809523809524

8642831,5,B00IK49U4A,The kids loved it. My son loved it and asks me to play it again for him. He was amazed about understanding mass a little better. I used it for my second graders and my 4 year old.,1524182400,,179,3.736842105263158
8642832,3,B00IK49U4A,"Brother Francis portrays a monk, a high voltage Friar Tuck, who is inviting children to experience and appreciate what the Mass is all about using examples of secular celebrations to make his point. Our family set down together with our 2nd grader who is preparing for her First Communion and her 1st grade sister. It was disappointing to see them watch for about 10 minutes, loose interest, and wander off.
My observations:
1. Brother Francis tries too hard to be upbeat. All his points are well taken but his enthusiasm is on full power all the time without respite. He wears you out.  He is equally enthused about every aspect of the Mass, like a clerical cheerleader. After a while his enthusiasm begins to sound artificial.
2. The producer tries to be thorough but includes so much material, major as well as minor points, that our youngsters were overwhelmed. At that age their attention span is limited. We used to be aware how Sesame Street used to brake up their programming into digestible, bite size segments, to avoid that pitfall.  We would have done better by watching for 10min, hitting the stop button, then talk about what we'd seen, then returning another time for another 10 minutes.",1522713600,,1202,4.8019323671497585
