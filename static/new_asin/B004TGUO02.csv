4465652,4,B004TGUO02,"Just so we're clear on one thing. This is the complete number of episodes HBO ever saw fit to release on DVD. It is NOT the complete episodes as originally ran on HBO. It represents a ""sample culling"" of same.",1389916800,53,209,4.25

4465655,1,B004TGUO02,"I like the series, so this review is not about the Hitchhiker... it is about this product, the supposed complete collection. There are literally a hundred episodes and by the implication of this title all of them should have been on this dvd. Instead i got only a handful of episodes from only one season. It wasn't even a complete season of the Hitchhiker. I was pissed. So now I vent.",1488240000,13,386,4.450704225352113

4465657,4,B004TGUO02,Havent seen this series since my mother watched every week when i was a little girl. She suggested i order this when i got the TFTC series. Hope the pic quality is good because its gotten mixed reviews. Packaging was perfect.,1487030400,,225,4.512195121951219
4465658,1,B004TGUO02,This set collects volumes 1-3 that were previously released separately into a single set which is great if you can't track them down. Just don't purchase if you're looking for a complete series collection.,1485475200,19,205,5.0588235294117645

4465665,1,B004TGUO02,This is NOT the Complete collection.  There are only 30 episodes here out of a total of 85 episodes. A deliberate lie - who do i see about that ????,1456790400,39,148,3.933333333333333

4465667,4,B004TGUO02,I bought this because I remember seeing it as a small child.  The themes are a bit repetitive and some of the acting is questionable.  It's a nice collection of relatively tame horror stories.,1453334400,2,192,4.617647058823529

8440649,1,B004TGUO02,"The show itself is fine  nice 80s nostalgia  and the presentation is okay here as well.

Less okay: calling this The Complete Collection when it includes fewer than half of the episodes. Thats not deceptive marketing  its a bald-faced lie. Not cool.",1527465600,,249,4.857142857142857

To all that have shown concern about the quantity of episodes v. the entire series, the truth lies in the detail...this is the complete collection of HBO ran episodes...the series shifted to the USA Network after about 35 episodes.

8440654,5,B004TGUO02,I rememberd a lot of the hitchhiker from the day. To see these actors and actresses when they were young was a treat. I have always liked the music score and the way the episodes are narrated.,1518566400,,192,4.216216216216216
8440655,3,B004TGUO02,"The episodes that were in this series were great. Loved them all. However, this is far from being a complete series as advertised. Lots and lots of episodes missing. At least 3/4, if not more, of the entire 6 season series is missing.. They should of called it ""best of the hitchhiker"" instead of the ""complete collection"". No where near a complete collection. Perhaps it was my fault for mistaking the word ""collection"" for ""series"". It is kind of misleading though. I'll have to pay attention more in how I read descriptions of products.",1517184000,2,539,4.74468085106383
