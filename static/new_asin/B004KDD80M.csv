4396935,5,B004KDD80M,"Is the Bible Reliable? is the second in a series of DVD's put out by the Focus on the Family Truth Project with a focus on teaching and educating college aged students.  In the box, you receive a two disc DVD set and a study guide.  The DVD contains 10 sessions, approximately 30 minutes each.  This set builds a historical case for the reliability of scripture using historical and archeological evidence.

I was surprised and how much I enjoyed this DVD set.  They did a great job of putting it together and including relevant and interesting information.  They didn't include any arguments that were new to me. This might seem like a funny compliment, but this was especially encouraging because after 9 years of theological education anything new is highly suspect.  They did a good job of explaining the views they were opposing and helped the students to understand the worldview that those views would logically have come from.

The series is highly apologetic in nature.  This has its strengths and weaknesses. Apologetics speaks will to a modernist mind but postmodern thinkers are less compelled by the arguments that apologetics present.  Just something to bear in mind.

The study guide is cute and little. For each session it has a fill in the blanks page to help keep the students focused on the main points. It also has some summary pages for each session.  I think you could listen to the series without purchasing the study guide.  It's a nice addition for students that need to write to learn but I don't think it's an essential.

8432915,1,B004KDD80M,"Review of Is the Bible Reliable: Building the Historical Case DVD by True-U, from the creators of Focus on the Family's ""The Truth Project.""

In compliance with new regulations introduced by the Federal Trade Commission, Tyndale House Publishers has provided me with a complimentary copy of this book.

Is the Bible Reliable is one of Focus on the Family's recent attempts to reach the 16-18 age group who are preparing to leave home and go to college. This series is well produced; the production quality is high, and each lesson is introduced by a ""cool"" guy doing something fun, whether it is walking through a college campus while being filmed at a strange angle, jumping off rocks, or otherwise just trying to draw attention to himself. Dr. Stephen Meyer is filmed inside a ""too-good-to-be-true"" looking classroom (I've never been in a classroom that looked that good). The staged audience is a group of excited young people. A lot of work was put in to make this series look very good.

As far as content, Dr. Stephen Meyer presents 10 lessons in which he argues for the historicity and literal reliability of various biblical texts. The 10 lessons are as follows:

The Patriarchal Narratives and the Documentary Hypothesis
The Exodus: From Egypt to Canaan
The Israelite Conquest
The United Kingdom of David and Solomon
Historicity of the Old Testament: A Tale of Two Conquests
The Babylonian Conquest of Judah
Canons of Historicity: The New Testament
Early Composition of Luke and Acts
External Corraboration (Yes, I believe that the intended word would be ""corroboration,"" so this is a typo on the back of the DVD box)
The Trial of Jesus
I am going to go in depth with the first and last lessons of the DVD. The others all follow the same similar style and have the same goal: proving that the bible is a reliable history.

""The Patriarchal Narratives and the Documentary Hypothesis""

Stephen Meyer opens up this first lesson with an explanation of why he is doing what he is doing. He claims that students go off to university or seminary, take courses in biblical studies, and end up questioning their faith. Meyer seems to think that questioning one's faith is a bad thing, so he has set up to provide high school students with the tools needed to resist what is being taught in biblical studies classrooms.

Meyer then opens up with a segment called ""The Critics,"" wherein he basically only talks about Julius Wellhausen, who Meyer claims came up with the documentary hypothesis (apparently Meyer has not heard of Eduard Ruess or Karl Heinrich Graf, to name a couple of predecessors to Wellhausen).

Meyer, unfortunately, does a poor job of explaining the Documentary Hypothesis as a whole, as well as misrepresenting a proper understanding of the parts, J, E, D, and P. Meyer states that these were all ""written"" long after the events described actually took place. He does not mention the idea of editing or redacting existing, older sources. This simple fact undermines his entire argument; of course details that only an ancient culture would be familiar with would be present in a collection of ancient documents redacted at a much later date.

Meyer then comments on the idea of covenants and treaties in the Old Testament compared to the rest of the ancient world. This is an area that I feel Meyer could have gained some ground in arguing for an earlier date for large chunks of the Pentateuch, but instead of focusing on Deuteronomy and the works of Mendenhall on suzerain/vassal treaties, he instead points out small elements of treaties found in Genesis, and therefore does not advance his point at all.

""The Trial of Jesus""

 In this final lesson, Meyer attempts to prove that the gospel account of Jesus' trial, death, and resurrection is true based on the fact that 5 major characters in the story are actually historical.

Meyer first proves that Herod Antipas was a historical figure by quoting Josephus, Philo, Suetonius, as well as noting archeological evidence found, namely coins of the time period. Then Meyer attempts to prove that Peter the disciple was a historical figure, using a 4th century writing that refers to a church that was built atop an old house, which had graffiti inside of it mentioning Peter and Jesus (I am not sure how that is proof that Peter lived in the house, but Meyer seems to think that it is). Then Meyer quotes Philo, Tacitus, and Josephus in order to prove that Pontius Pilate existed. The fourth character is Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest that was known to have been in power from 18-36 CE. Meyer cites the Caiaphas ossuary (and I am actually surprised he did not cite the recent ""discover"" of the false ""Jesus nails"" that were said to be found in the ossuary) as proof that Caiaphas existed.

Finally, Meyer cites Jesus as the fifth major player in these stories. He cites Josephus and he cites the James ossuary. Now, if you are familiar with the James Ossuary, you know that the person credited for finding this ossuary is facing forgery charges in Israel. Any self-respecting scholar has distanced his or her self from this ossuary (Meyer attempts to explain the validity of the ossuary in lesson 9, but ignores the majority of the arguments against it that are present in scholarship).

The points that Meyer makes are either obvious to any well-read scholar, or based on likely forgeries. I think that you would have trouble finding any person educated on first century religion in Jerusalem would disagree that any of these five people existed. This is obvious. The problem is that Meyer makes the huge jump from ""the bible mentions people who actually existed"" to ""everything in the bible must be true!"" I, personally, come to the same conclusions about the death and resurrection of Jesus that Meyer does, but I feel that he has made some interesting jumps from ""evidence"" to conclusions when there was never a connection between the two.

Ultimately, this is not a DVD series that I would ever consider using. Dr. Meyer seems to make a mockery of higher education in his quest to prepare students to ""defend"" their faith instead of learning about their faith. Questioning is not encouraged, but instead is looked down upon. Finally, Dr. Meyer, a creation-scientist, has stepped out of his realm to try to tackle biblical studies as well as Ancient Near East studies in one fell swoop. Unfortunately, he seems to have overreached his capabilities, and the only people who will enjoy this series are those people who already fervently agree with his view.",1329004800,6,6533,4.845739910313902
8432916,5,B004KDD80M,"Having watched Does God Exist?, the first in this series, I was eager to watch this one, the second in the series. It does not disappoint. It is an excellent review of the achaeological, documentary, and historical proofs for the reliability of the Bible. I highly recommend it to all who wish to objectively study this subject.",1322179200,,328,4.771929824561403
8432917,5,B004KDD80M,"I was given a 2 disc DVD called Is the Bible Reliable to review from Tyndale.  This was a very interesting study.  I really enjoyed it.  It was like I was sitting in the classroom learning with those much younger kids.  The video is put out by Focus on the Family through their Truth Project.

This was the 2nd in a series, and I definitely want to buy the rest of them!  There were 10 sessions on these 2 discs.  Included was a study guide.  This cute little book fit right into the trendy little box that the DVD and book came in.

Being as these videos are in a college classroom, the instructor definitely taught a lot of historical facts.  That is one of my favorite subjects!  Mix history in with religion and I'm hooked!

I would recommend this series of DVDs to my friends and family.  In fact, I would also recommend this for a teen or adult Bible study group.  I am keeping this video to add to my library and can't wait to get the rest!",1311638400,,947,4.188888888888889
8432918,5,B004KDD80M,"I was first introduced to The Truth Project's new series ""True U"" when I saw ""The Toughest Test in College"" documentary -- the first in the series. Needless to say, I was very impressed. This second installment -- Is The Bible Reliable? -- was no less disappointing. In classroom setting, Dr. Stephen Meyer confidently teaches students why we can trust that our Bible is reliable.

The synopsis of Is The Bible Reliable? is as follows:

Who is God, and how can we know Him? The Bible claims to be the direct revelation of our Creator. So if the biblical record is true, it is a primary means by which the God of the universe has revealed Himself to mankind. However, if it can be proved false, then the God of whom it speaks is simply one more pretender in the assembly of gods that man has created.  In Is The Bible Reliable? Dr. Stephen Meyer challenges you to examine the historical and archaeological evidence to determine for yourself the veracity and accuracy of Scripture. Is the Bible true? You decide.

In this package, which includes two DVDs, you will learn the following:

Disc 1:
1) The Patriarchal Narratives and the Documentary Hypothesis
2) The Exodus: From Egypt to Canaan
3) The Israelite Conquest
4) The United Kingdom of David and Solomon
5) Historicity of the Old Testament: A Tale of Two Conquests

Disc 2:
6) The Babylonian Conquest of Judah
7) Canons of Historicity: The New Testament
8) Early Composition of Luke and Acts
9) External Corroboration
10) The Trial of Jesus

Also included is a discussion guide to be used in conjunction with the DVDs.

Includes:
- Questions to help facilitate group discussion
- Creative exercises to help participants gain a greater understanding of the subject matter
- Sidebars with background information to expand on the DVD content

Some of the highlights were the humorous cartoons in the discussion guide which help to support the subject matter. Also, before and after each lesson, I was delighted to see Dave Stotts from the Drive Through History series as he shares a few words on the Bible's importance in congruence with the topic at hand in each lesson! I was also fascinated by the section on archaeology which supports the Bible.

Overall, I really enjoyed Is The Bible Reliable? With a great teacher, excellent slide presentation graphics, and a discussion guide to ease following along, this series is sure to keep your interest as you learn about the reliability of the Bible. I highly recommend this series to everyone, and I think it does a good job of fulfilling its purpose: ""You will be equipped to defend your faith and become a world changer in an increasingly hostile culture.""

8432919,5,B004KDD80M,"Is The Bible Reliable? This DVD and study guide is an invaluable resource that anyone with a high school or college student should have. This second DVD set in the TRUE U series by Focus on the Family is very well put together and provides the tools that students need for defending their Christian beliefs. This DVD set focuses on buildin the historical case for the Bible and has 2 disc with 5 episodes each (10 total). The topics discussed are:
1. The Patriarchal Narratives and Documentary Hypothesis
2. The Exodus
3. The Israelite Conquest
4. The United Kingdom of David and Solomon
5. Historicity of the Old Testament
6. The Babylonian Conquest of Judah
7. Canons of Historicity: The New Testament
8. Early Composition of Luke and Acts
9. External Corraboration
10. The Trial of Jesus

The episodes are filmed in a classroom style setting with a professor and several students. Each topic discussed focuses on showing historical and archaelogical evidence that the accounts in the Bible are true. I truly found these episodes to be fascinating. The items found in the excavations of the cities that the Israelites conquered gave extra-Biblical evidence that confirms many of the stories contained in the Bible. What I really like about this series is that the explanations given to give the Bible reliability are from sources outside of the Bible, such as historians and archaeologists.
Even such small details as name popularity and writing styles give proof to the accurate timeline depicted in the Bible. The excavations of the ancient Biblical cities have uncovered pottery, coins,and other items that were accurate to the time period, as well as external writings on tablets and  cylinders that tell the same stories that are recorded in the Bible. All of these give evidence to the fact that the Bible is accurate and reliable.
We actually have been using this DVD with our high school students for our summer Bible study and they have really gotten a lot of valuable information out of it. I am so thanful to be able to equip our student with the tools to help them defend their faith. In a generation when so many of our young people are in need of resources to be able to not only say what they believe, but why they believe that way, this DVD will equip them in one more way to be able to give an answer to those who ask.
I highly recommend this DVD set. The study guide that comes with it allows the students to fill in the blank as they watch the series and has addition study helps in it as well.

8432920,5,B004KDD80M,"I can teach my boys about the Bible.  I can take them to Sunday School.  I can buy them every Bible they ask for or need.  However, until they accept what they have learned as absolute truth and know in their heart that what they have learned is more than words on paper, but words to pattern their life after, all my efforts are futile.

Growing up one of the most popular arguments that was given when I asked a question was, ""Because I said so.""  Our children are living in a technological age.  A place where information is at their fingertips.  ""Because I said so"" is a very lame answer and if we are not willing to answer their questions about God then someone will.  One of the great positives about ""Is The Bible Reliable?"" is that it doesn't answer questions with ""You should believe it because the Bible says so.""  It gives very solid and reliable answers that students can sink their teeth into.  While many of us grew up believing that if it was in the Bible then we shouldn't question it, our kids have been surrounded by anti-Bible and anti-Christian messages in everything from television, magazines, video games and school textbooks.  They need solid information which will cement the fact that the Bible is truly reliable.  ""Is The Bible Reliable?"" presents the information in a very intellectual way.

Stephen Mayers present ten classroom lectures including...

  In the footsteps of Abraham
  The Exodus: From Egypt to Canaan
  The Israelites Conquer the Promised Land
  Israel's rise to prominence through David and Solomon
  The Assyrian Invasion
  The Babylonian conquest of Judah
  Investigating the historical authenticity of the New Testament
  The reliability of Luke and Acts
  How archaelogy backs up the New Testament
  The trial of Jesus

In addition to the 30 minute lectures on DVD, there is a great book containing extra information, quizzes and cartoons.

I am a big fan of TrueU.  I think that it makes a great course for homeschool, Sunday School or just family Bible Study.  It is something I would recommend for any high school student before they leave for college.

8432921,5,B004KDD80M,"Last year, through Tyndale, I was able to attend a True U presentation with Dr. Stephen Meyer at Focus on the Family.  I purchased the first volume of True U there -- Does God Exist?  It was a Christmas present for my teen.

He loved it.  Finding that each segment is introduced and closed by Dave Stotts was a huge bonus (we love Dave's Drive-Thru History DVDs and own every one of them).  He loved Dr. Meyer.  Clearly, Dr. Meyer is accustomed to talking to young adults, and it shines through in the video.  His presentations are engaging, funny, and energetic.  He says things in a way that sticks with you.

When I had the chance to review Is the Bible Reliable? -- well, to say ""I jumped at the chance"" is a bit of an understatement.  ""I screamed"" is a bit closer to reality.

Am I ever glad I did (review this, that is -- the screaming was optional).  As much as we liked Volume 1, well, we absolutely loved Volume 2.  Volume 1 is subtitled ""building the scientific case"" and to some extent, it is material we have heard before.  Presented fabulously, but still, a lot of stuff we've heard elsewhere.

Volume 2 is subtitled, ""building the historical case"" and it is amazing.  Dr. Meyer traces through the Bible, starting with ""In the Footsteps of Abraham"" and ending with ""The Trial of Jesus.""  All along the way, Dr. Meyer is presenting archaeological evidence and it was fascinating.  Absolutely fascinating.  My ten year old didn't really watch the first True U set.  He insisted on being a part of this one, though, as he wants to go into archaeology when he grows up, and this is exactly the kind of work he wants to be doing.

And again, Dave Stotts is providing the introductory and concluding comments to each segment.

I don't have the words to express how strongly I feel about this program.  I think every Christian teen needs to watch this series before heading off to college or out into the world.  And if they are heading off to college, they need to own the DVDs and rewatch them.

I will, if necessary, give up food in order to purchase future volumes of True U.  How's that for an endorsement?

He presents archaeological evidence showing that things happened as described in the Bible and at the time period specified.  He also presented various historical documents that were written during the time period and matched the documentation recorded in various books of the Bible.  He talked about the trips he had taken to the Holy Land and passed around artifacts for the students to touch and examine.  He showed pictures and maps and the Bible just came alive.
