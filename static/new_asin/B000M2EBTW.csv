8165776,1,B000M2EBTW,"I purchased this DVD because I was actually in a production of this operetta at the Santa Fe Opera House as one of the school kids.  It arrived very quickly, but no matter what language I selected, I received a message...disc cannot be formatted.  I tried several times but without success.  Returning the merchandise was extremely easy with Amazon.  I do not fault Amazon.com, but I do fault the disc itself.",1378252800,,409,4.71830985915493
8165777,4,B000M2EBTW,"Some may find this miniature treasure an incomprehensible oddity, but that's only if they are unaware of its historic value. This filming of the Menotti opera's premiere production is one of a groundbreaking series out of the Hamburg Opera in the late 1960s. All these have one unique feature in common: they attempt to break out of the then-omnipresent mold of filming opera productions purely as records of their stage versions.

Like the landmark ""Teufel von Loudun"" video, and others in the series, Menotti's work is treated as though it were cinema. No proscenium arch is ever seen, nor a conductor and orchestra, nor a watching audience. Instead, despite the limitations of the original proscenium-designed sets, the cameraman Joachim Hess uses close-ups, dolly movement, and carefully narrowed framing to give the impression we are entirely in the world of the fantasy tale itself. The perhaps unforeseen result, especially considering the material, is a video with the feel of those grandly tacky old science fiction movies from the 1950s. Especially the first scene in the bus with the children eerily conjures the threadbare joys of those earnest days, and the effect for those with an eye for it is like falling through a window in time.

Menotti's amiable neo-Romantic musical language is especially friendly to this nave reworking of alien invasion yarns as told through the eyes of children and child-like adults. At the time of its premiere, it was also considered groundbreaking for its use of electronic instruments, despite Blomdahl's pioneering uses in his own science fiction opera, ""Aniara,"" of 1959. It must be said Menotti deploys his electronics stodgily but even this adds to the opera's quaint charm.",1348704000,2,1726,5.182795698924731
8165778,3,B000M2EBTW,"Help! Help! The Globolinks is a novelty opera with some good Menotti music in it.  This German production was not up to the Houston Grand Opera presentation in 1972.  The Hamburg State Opera staging featured two or three well-known singers, including Franz Grundheber.  The movement of the globolinks was not particularly well-done.

The opening in Houston had featured a Houston Police Department cruiser racing onto the stage with lights flashing and sirens wailing.  That is a tough act to follow.",1185667200,4,500,5.2
