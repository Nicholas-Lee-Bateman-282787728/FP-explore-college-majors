I also like the big shake, Showdown at redgulch, Robosaur park & abunch of other ones. This one has Briteman & Pharoahman. I even have megaman on my gameboy.",1086307200,,280,4.017857142857143
7906555,3,B00000F0FM,"Mega Man TV show is bland, lacks character development and suspense. Even Dragon Ball( Dubbed and Edited still contained the above content this show lacks.) The best episode was ""The Beginning"". Other than that I could come up with humorous spoofs for these episodes! Yes Mega Man X Emporium is a website made by fans. Maybe you could write some fanfiction instead of rotting you're brain watching this mindless drivel. My advice watch Dragon ball(Dubbed and Edited Version on Cartoon Network) it has a strong plot and believable scenarios.",998956800,,540,5.078651685393258

Though the storyline is a tad off from the video Game version. The show is packed with action, and some really good senses. If your a MegaMan fan, you'll love this video..:)",983750400,,318,4.229508196721311
