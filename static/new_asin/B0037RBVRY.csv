4081950,4,B0037RBVRY,"Yes, the photography is beautiful and the subject matter, the ""life"" of the Park itself can stunning. Unfortunately, Selleck seems mostly disinterested and almost flat, though the narration is clear and enunciated well. Still, if you enjoy Yellowstone, it's something well-worth the time and cost of the blu-ray.",1280361600,,312,5.520833333333333
8390686,4,B0037RBVRY,I really enjoyed this DVD when it was available on Netflix. I like having my own copy and watch it often. I love the National Geographic nature films.,1490659200,,150,4.392857142857143
8390687,1,B0037RBVRY,Quality of this Blu Ray is terrible. Sound kept dropping off. So I sent it back. Low and behold. Second one I got had same problem. So I sent it back and got a full refund.,1461110400,,172,3.8055555555555554
8390688,5,B0037RBVRY,"Fascinating video documentary on the efforts of a group of folks who are trying to preserve a taste of the wild plains that the early pioneers encountered many years ago as they traveled west. It presents a reasonably balance view, perhaps at times a bit skewed, but aren't we all prejudiced on some level towards what we feel strongly about? I give them props for not being over the top with their push to preserve a piece of Americana and trying to find a balance between current land use and a desire to preserve what once was",1425340800,,529,4.463917525773196
8390689,5,B0037RBVRY,This movie is really good. I like looking at all the native species of animals.,1425254400,,79,4.333333333333333
8390690,5,B0037RBVRY,"American Seregeti documents the ambitious efforts of American Prairie Reserve to restore a huge wildlife conservation area of over three million acres in northeastern Montana to something resembling its former ecosystem. Buffalo, prairie dogs and many other species are being used to seed it with native wildlife. The film tells the story of how biologists, rangers, and local people are working together to make this happen. Very professionally photographed and narrated. See wiki entry APR entry for background info.",1420588800,,518,5.569620253164557
8390691,5,B0037RBVRY,"Despite some rather bad reviews I read, I went ahead & bought this & I'm very glad I did. I love the Great Plains scenery, all of the history behind the dwindling animal species - from prairie dogs to bison to antelope. I thought Tom Selleck did an excellent job at narrating this program. Very informative & after watching this - I did feel a bit of hope for the future of this preserve. It is what it is. This is an informative program about trying to re-establish a large section of the Great Plains to what they once were. If you're wanting to be entertained by Hollywood special effects, foul language, or gratuitous sex jokes - you shouldn't be watching this, let alone reviewing it!",1416355200,,689,4.476190476190476
8390692,5,B0037RBVRY,This is a great documentary.  The filming is wonderful with great shots of wild life and scenery.  It was informative about the history of the plains and the animals who lived there.  It was also encouraging in it's explanation of what is being done to restore the plains to it's former state and save the species that live on the plains.  I showed it do a group of senior citizens and we had a good discussion after the viewing.,1404691200,,429,4.3924050632911396
8390693,5,B0037RBVRY,"THIS is a very well made programme.the picture quality is superb,the subject interesting.the choice of tom selleck
insperational.the programme tells of building your own SERENGETI from scratch and stories from explorers of
yesteryear,about bringing the plains back to what they were.its taking a while but it took a while to get here. so now
people are taking an interest.and tom's deep voice brings it all together.if you only get one SERENGETI disc this is
it enjoy it like i did the (other one is also good) so make it 2  i have.the cuz",1359417600,2,539,4.795698924731183
8390694,5,B0037RBVRY,"Very interesting! This DVD is about the efforts of dedicated scientists to restore the American Prairie lands (around Montana and neighboring areas). Since more people have left this area to live in cities, the animals just might have a chance...with a little help from their scientific friends.

This would be a great video for a family to watch.",1293148800,,347,4.982758620689655
8390695,4,B0037RBVRY,For narration I give this DVD a 1. FOr visual effects 4 stars or 5. Selleck must be overlooked to enjoy this DVD. Really to bad. I don't understand how this bad voicing slipped thru.,1292284800,,182,4.228571428571429
