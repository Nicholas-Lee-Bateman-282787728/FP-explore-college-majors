8564372,5,B00B92L7FU,"I can absolutely not understand why one reviewer gave this a one star. It is absolutely a timeless, life-changing message. This very young girl loved Christ in a way, in a depth, that most adults have no clue about. If you have ever faced any struggle, trial - no matter how big or small others say it was/is - this dvd is for you. There isn't even much acting in it, it's just kind of a simulation of the accident. It was such a small part of the dvd and the message was AMAZING. Would be awesome for a Sunday School to watch or a Youth Group (especially High School, probably Jr High, too).",1460678400,,592,4.201754385964913
8564373,5,B00B92L7FU,"Real life portrait of grief and Christian maturity. The resolution is, as in the book of Job, simply, in the midst of the pain, bowing before the known attributes of God i.e. His omniscience, goodness, and sovereignty. The account of this family's struggle touched me deeply and the transparent
tribute to their precious daughter/sister Lygon was most fitting. The scene with this young devoted disciple ""dancing with God"" was priceless. The conclusion leaves you with the Christian's certain hope beyond the grave, God knows; He hears; He cares. We don't have to understand. God bless
the Stevens' family for this bittersweet tribute--hope with tears. It was excellent!",1445644800,4,670,5.271028037383178

8564376,1,B00B92L7FU,"Horrible acting, and I don't feel like the family portrayed her story as she would have wanted. It was just terrible. So disappointed. I was glad they read from her actual journal. I would suggest only purchasing the book they have out of her journal.",1426550400,,251,4.6
8564377,5,B00B92L7FU,absolutely wonderful! A must see!,1426377600,,33,5.8
8564378,5,B00B92L7FU,Very moving and inspirational. It kept me in tears....but also smiles. What a faith she had for such a young girl. Oh that we could all be in that place! Would have loved to have known her....but we were able through her journal.,1426204800,2,229,4.348837209302325
