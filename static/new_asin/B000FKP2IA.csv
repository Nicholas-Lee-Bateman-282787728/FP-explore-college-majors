2570359,2,B000FKP2IA,"I love Rodney, always will, so you can understand why when I viewed this release I was dissapointed. It had about a total of 12 minutes of the main man in his best form, yet the rest of the presentation was a collection of other comedians that are OK but not the stuff I was after.  I can only take so much Tim Allen. There is only one Rodney and the others pale next to him but I would have liked a little more camera time with the king. Live and learn.",1244073600,,454,3.9347826086956523
2570360,5,B000FKP2IA,"All I can say is, if you are ever having a bunch of people over to watch a game, show this DVD at halftime break if you want to watch a bunch of people bent over splitting their sides in laughter.  Two skits here are some of Rodney's greatest ever, ""The Tonight Show"" with Rich Little as Johnny Carson, and another where Rodney applies for a job as a porno actor (is that a perfect Rodney scenario or WHAT?), complete with the famous porn star Ron Jeremy playing himself.",1241308800,,471,4.292134831460674
2570361,4,B000FKP2IA,"I watched this years ago when it originally aired twenty(!!) years ago on HBO and wondered if it would ever be released on DVD. It was the first time I had seen Tim Allen and Jeff Foxworthy, and I fondly remembered laughing loudly through the whole show. I'm pretty certain this show is one of the main reasons Tim Allen got his own show two years later and we all know what a huge success story he's been. Of course, the same can be said for Jeff Foxworthy. His own success has been nothing short of tremendous. I wish these two had done more than just a couple minutes. The other comics were also decent as well. The short skits featuring Rodney and his ""girlfriend"" are mildly amusing but I would have preferred them to be a little less graphic. At times it almost seemed they felt the need to use the ""F"" bomb in order to be amusing. Of course it was HBO and cable was still stretching its legs in 1989 to see what people would and would not tolerate. Overall, the scenes with Tim Allen and Jeff Foxworthy make this disk a great deal for me.",1237593600,,1045,4.256281407035176
2570362,5,B000FKP2IA,This was a 1989 video but is still very funny and well worth the price!,1237507200,,71,3.8
2570363,5,B000FKP2IA,"I watched this particular Special many years ago with my sisters and brothers over and over and we laughed each and every time we watched it.  Wow I found it on DVD and am purchasing a copy for each of my sisters and brothers...we will watch together and bring back old memories and sooooo many laughs again.  It still packs a punch with skits but is on the adult side, so one must be aware of that..however, Rodney is awesome and the young comedians who are now older and famous comdians....are awesome....",1227571200,,507,4.5
2570364,4,B000FKP2IA,This was hilarious!  Fun to see some of the greatest comedians in their early days light up the stage.  Made us laugh out loud!,1168473600,,127,4.25
2570365,5,B000FKP2IA,"I had seen the original show on HBO back in 1989 and was hoping one day to be able to view the show again...Tim Allen and Jeff Foxworthy are featured before they became the household names they are today.  The other lesser know comics are equally hysterical.  Larry Reeb, Greg Travis (punk magician routine) and John Fox are terrific.  There are several sketches with Rodney at his very best.  The Johnny Carson skit in particular with Rodney and Rich Little (as Johnny) alone is worth the price for this DVD.  I am glad to be able to add this to my dvd comedy collection after waiting for so long and watch it whenever I need a good laugh",1167868800,13,639,4.38135593220339
2570366,5,B000FKP2IA,"If there's a King of Comedy, then this collection of comedians absolutely has to be considered the Conquerors' of Comedy with Rodney as Genghis Khan.  Tim Allen and Jeff Foxworthy make you wonder if this really took place in 1989, as they speak in truths that only they can tell.  With Jeff Foxworthy hitting it big, and Tim Allen being a TV sitcom legend, it's easy to see why they were selected.",1164931200,2,397,4.5
2570367,5,B000FKP2IA,"I have watched a few of the DVD's from this collection and found each one equally hilarious. Being the youngster that I am, I figured Rodney's comedy would be even more appreciated by my father. So, I got him two of the DVD's for Father's day. Before he even watched them, he called to say how excited he was and that he never new such a DVD existed (he has been a big Rodney fan ever since Caddy Shack). Then, over the weekend I got another call from him, saying how fantastic they were. Then, a few more days later I got calls from his friends asking where I got them from.

After this experience I can attest that these make fantastic gifts.",1150848000,3,644,4.235772357723577

Plus seeing Rodney like you never have before. Yes!",1479081600,,112,4.947368421052632

And on Amazon you can get just about anything you want so I bought it.",1375315200,,127,3.923076923076923
8124097,4,B000FKP2IA,"Great DVD , can't give it 5 stars because of the steep price of it. I wanted and liked the DVD, I have a VHS copy that broke.",1360454400,,125,3.5
8124098,5,B000FKP2IA,I had this tape (that's how long ago it was) back in the late 80s and lost it. I went nuts looking for it online. Finally found it here and it is still just as funny. It's great to see these comics again and how different they looked back then. A great find. They may not all have come as far as Tim Allen and Jeff Foxworthy but they sure had it in this vid. ENJOY!!,1293753600,,366,3.8289473684210527
8124099,4,B000FKP2IA,"I love comedy, and lets face it, Rodney Dangerfield is an icon for comedy. However this DVD just didn't do it for me. Not that it wouldn't please somebody else, but I was shooting in the dark when I ordered thinking it was mainly Rodney entertaining an audience as a solo act. There is short skits by Rodney, not enough to please me personally, some of the other acts were very funny, some boring.
It breaks down to, if your ordering this DVD to focus on Rodney's comedy, there just isn't enough of it. But if you enjoy Rodney and (more of) his guest comedians, then you will enjoy the DVD, either way, it is a classic in it's own comedy style.",1284249600,,644,4.286885245901639
8124100,5,B000FKP2IA,"For all of the Rodney Dangerfield fans out there, this is a must have. This collection of works will enable you to remember why we all loved this comic and his comedic style. I have several videos of this gentle man and this one is more of a collection of a lot of them. Therefore, if there is only one video of this standup comic in your collection, this has to be it.",1281398400,,369,4.068493150684931

8124102,2,B000FKP2IA,If I could have returned the CD I would have... I like Rodney Dangerfield all this was of comidians perfrming at his club and a few inserts of Rodney... One was a clip from his movie Back to School of him diving...,1266192000,,214,4.119047619047619
