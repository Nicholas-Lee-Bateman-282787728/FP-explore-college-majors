5334823,1,B009H3LOMO,"The premise is good, but the show itself is very slow. Excruciatingly slow",1467504000,5,74,4.769230769230769
5334824,3,B009H3LOMO,"Not a bad movie, give great insight of how football is played in the state of Mississippi for junior college.",1467417600,,109,4.5
5334825,2,B009H3LOMO,"To dang slow, cheesy, I didn't like it and I like anything that has to do with football..",1467158400,,89,4.0
5334826,1,B009H3LOMO,Not very interesting. I couldn't even finish it. The attempt at humor by having the mascots trying to do silly things was just ridiculous.,1466726400,,138,4.791666666666667
5334827,5,B009H3LOMO,IT OUTLINE THE PRINCIPAL OF THE GAME AND THE REQUIREMENT TO BE THE BEST AS A PLAYER AND TEAM WITH SPORTSMANSHIP.,1466294400,,112,4.380952380952381
5334828,1,B009H3LOMO,"This is more of a promotional video for the schools with a focus on football. Not a great film, very repetitive",1459209600,,111,4.333333333333333
5334829,5,B009H3LOMO,loved it - kick ass football like it should be,1458172800,,46,3.7
5334830,4,B009H3LOMO,It was a good overall view of junior college football in Missississippi. There was not as much history in the video as I thought there would be.,1368316800,,144,4.37037037037037
5334831,3,B009H3LOMO,"This is just a promotional video for the JUCO league in Mississippi and their junior colleges. I have seen harder hits on Kenny Chesneys documentary ""boys of fall"", so this doesn't really look like the toughest league in America. Though still it is quite ok and gives you a feeling for the tradition of those junior colleges. It's nice to watch, but you don't miss something, if you don't see it.",1360886400,,396,4.591549295774648
5334875,1,B009H3LOMO,Couldn't get past the 1960s era narration.  Just didn't fit at all.,1484179200,,67,4.583333333333333
5334876,1,B009H3LOMO,Just plain bad.  Don't waste your time even reading the description.,1483574400,,68,5.181818181818182
5334877,1,B009H3LOMO,Last Chance U must have learned their lesson from this awful documentary. I couldn't finish watching this,1482796800,,105,5.235294117647059
5334878,1,B009H3LOMO,"Literally one of the most boring things I've ever watched. The idea behind it is solid. The football looks good. But it took almost 28 minutes before you see any game film. Plus the announcer on the game film was horrible. The narrator sounded like he was from 1980's documentaries. Again, great idea, really rough output.",1480032000,,322,4.767857142857143
5334879,3,B009H3LOMO,"It was ok.  It was a little bit longer than it it probably needed to be, but had some interesting points about JUCO football.",1479686400,,125,4.208333333333333
5334880,4,B009H3LOMO,Real life football and home town support,1478908800,,40,4.857142857142857
5334881,4,B009H3LOMO,Good but not great; slow and somewhat predictable.,1478563200,,50,5.375
5334882,4,B009H3LOMO,Decent clip,1478476800,,11,5.0
5334883,1,B009H3LOMO,"Quaint and starts off nice as a historical look at the league but in an effort to give each school it's own time, the film drags on.  Each highlight of a school starts to bleed together. Would've been better if it were about an hour shorter.",1476403200,,241,4.239130434782608
5334884,1,B009H3LOMO,This is a 2 hour documentary of people talking. Boring,1476230400,,54,4.5
5334925,1,B009H3LOMO,They wasted 9 min for an introduction of useless video footage!,1476144000,,63,4.818181818181818
5334926,1,B009H3LOMO,"Way too many B-reels to be considered a full featured documentary film! No plot, no interviews worth mentioning. All around horrible structure and format. This video gives low-budget a bad name! Even at the free price tag, this video is too expensive. A waste of life and phone battery (viewed via Amazon Video app.)",1475020800,2,316,4.87037037037037
5334927,2,B009H3LOMO,"Not much football insight, mostly filler. However, the cowbells in the music for the actual games is fantastic!",1474934400,,111,5.222222222222222
5334928,5,B009H3LOMO,Loved it!,1474502400,,9,4.0
5334929,4,B009H3LOMO,Great discovery. I didn't know about this football system. The players and fans are awesome. The story telling got long winded at times. It could have been shorter or better yet done in episodes to provide more specific information on all the JUCOS.,1474156800,,249,4.813953488372093
5334930,5,B009H3LOMO,I thought it was a very good film ... To see what these young men go through to make it to the nfl,1474156800,,98,3.3043478260869565
5334931,1,B009H3LOMO,"After watching Last Chance U, i really couldn't get into this.",1473984000,,62,4.7272727272727275
5334932,3,B009H3LOMO,Absolutely all over the place film...very basic quality....but redeemed by the behind the scenes look...when It does actually talk about the football.  Definitely could have used some serious editing.,1473984000,,200,5.896551724137931
5334933,1,B009H3LOMO,Trash,1473465600,,5,5.0

5334955,4,B009H3LOMO,"Provides an inside look at all the wannabes that didn't make it or couldn't cut it at the big time college football programs, and how spoiled many of them are with little interest in education",1473033600,,192,4.514285714285714
5334956,2,B009H3LOMO,Not much of a story here just a glimpse of the league in general.,1472774400,,65,3.7142857142857144
5334957,5,B009H3LOMO,great coach,1472428800,,11,5.0
5334958,1,B009H3LOMO,Terrible,1471737600,,8,8.0
5334959,2,B009H3LOMO,"If you want to see a series about how tough JUCO football is in Mississippi, watch Last Chance U on Netflix.  It follows East Mississippi Community College and it depicts how rough football is down there.",1471737600,3,204,4.666666666666667
5334960,1,B009H3LOMO,"It wasn't a documentary, it was a promotional film for Mississippi JC Football.",1471564800,,79,5.153846153846154
5334961,1,B009H3LOMO,Unfortunately I'd just finished watching the Amazon/HBO series All Or Nothing about the NFL. Juco couldn't compare.,1471132800,,115,5.823529411764706
5334962,1,B009H3LOMO,Boring,1470787200,,6,6.0
5334963,1,B009H3LOMO,The narrator is awful i couldn't watch the whole thing because of that guy's voice,1470700800,,82,4.533333333333333
5334964,5,B009H3LOMO,"Of course, I love this because it is about Mississippi junior college football. I love the term ""juco"".  For the last couple of years I have grown more interested in junior college football because we have such good players on that level. I have been following it because it is fascinating. This documentary open my eyes as to why.  Very interesting!",1469577600,,350,4.721311475409836
5334996,1,B009H3LOMO,Terrible show,1468713600,,13,6.0
5334997,3,B009H3LOMO,"Very informative, however could have been filmed better.",1468540800,,56,6.125
5334998,1,B009H3LOMO,"Honestly the worst documentary I have watched in a long time. Almost no storyline. Very little football.

If you aren't an alumni of a Mississippi Juno, this will bore you times ten.",1468540800,2,182,4.6875

5335000,5,B009H3LOMO,I strongly recommend this movie.,1468540800,,32,5.6
5335001,3,B009H3LOMO,Interesting story about JUCO football. Worth watching if you'received a football fan. A little slow and repetitive.  A lot of players have been developed in the JUCO circuit.,1468454400,,174,5.214285714285714
5335002,1,B009H3LOMO,"Horrible film, more of a recruiting film than a documentary.",1468281600,,60,5.1
5335003,1,B009H3LOMO,Bad narration,1468022400,,13,6.0

8541491,1,B009H3LOMO,"Amateur filmmaking at best. I just kept thinking this could really be well done, if it was done the polar opposite of this! I swear I heard this exact same narrator doing those 50s ads you see at drive-in movie theaters.",1510790400,,220,4.390243902439025

8541493,1,B009H3LOMO,This was pretty lousy in comparison to Last Chance U,1501718400,,52,4.3
8541494,1,B009H3LOMO,"The Video is excellent, some of the best hard hitting content Ive seen.

What Absolutely ruins it, is the narrator. The narrator is UNBELIEVABLY HORRIBLE! You really couldn't make a worse, voice over than this!

Such a waste of excellent video for Gawd Aweful voice over. I really can't stress hard enough how much potential this documentary has if its done with professional narration.",1499472000,,386,5.015625
8541495,1,B009H3LOMO,Wasn't expecting much but this was just bad,1489276800,2,43,4.5
8541496,3,B009H3LOMO,"Good idea and Good story, but painfully slow.",1488844800,,45,4.75

8541499,4,B009H3LOMO,Interesting movie.  Could have done with a little more football and a little less of the peripherals.,1484352000,,101,4.9411764705882355
