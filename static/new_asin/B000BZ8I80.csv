8094656,5,B000BZ8I80,"This is a great performance by Westlife and makes their relative anonymity in North America even more puzzling.  They've really matured into phenomenal entertainers far beyond their ""boy band"" label.  Potential buyers of this DVD should be cautious however.  I ordered it because the info page clearly states ""NTSC"" (the North American television standard), the only Westlife DVD so labeled.  When it arrived I played it only on my computer until several months later when I took it to some friends' house for them to become familiar with Westlife.  It was only then that I discovered it was, in fact, PAL (European television standard) and totally unplayable on US TVs.  I'm not sure if it's even available in NTSC so, if you order it, read the fine print on the package before opening or be prepared to view it only on your computer.  If you do get to play it, you will enjoy it!",1216252800,,881,4.681818181818182
8094657,4,B000BZ8I80,"Number 1's Tour was the second tour Westlife performed as a 4-piece band, and it was incredible! The tour was well recorded and the special features are top-notched.  If you like this tour, you will also like their previous tour ""Turnaround""...but ""Turnaround"" is a region 2 DVD so it's unplayable in the US (mostly).  Some of the key performances were Uptown Girl, The Rat Pack Medley, Disco Medley, Mandy, Flying Without Wings, and bascially...all the songs! Watch out for the ""Face To Face"" Tour later this year!",1155945600,,515,4.908045977011494
