8759681,2,B01EW7DEG8,"Read the other negatigve reviews. They are all correct. This was low, low production, bad acting and really boring stories.  I could deal with all the negatives if the stories had been more creative or innovative. Nope. This is not worth your time.",1515974400,,248,4.767441860465116
8759682,2,B01EW7DEG8,"This was terrible! I have a rule to finish a movie, just in case it gets better. It doesn't. They should do their research on the energy drink short. Allergy pills cause drowsiness, not wake you up. That really annoyed me. But even without that, still terrible. Good thing it was on prime.",1513641600,,289,4.471698113207547

8759685,1,B01EW7DEG8,Ya this one was your typical low grade anthology like movie. Very boring and not a whole lot happens. I see that there is a second one out now so maybe that one could be good but this is a waste of time.,1505433600,,203,3.744186046511628
8759686,4,B01EW7DEG8,"This film is a lot of fun and very cleverly written. Clearly it's made by genre fans, but more than that they are talented filmmakers who know how to write comedy and horror. I enjoyed all the snarky characters and the classic horror film references. It doesn't reinvent the chain saw, but for pure entertainment Volumes of Blood delivers.",1492128000,,339,4.762711864406779
8759687,5,B01EW7DEG8,This movie was great!  I loved the dialogue in the wrap around segment and the guy with the moustache and eyebrows was so deadpan it was great!  Definitely recommend!,1486252800,,166,4.689655172413793

8759689,4,B01EW7DEG8,"Four college students sitting in a library relate their ideas to start an urban legend, The film consists of their four tales plus a film within a film for the final story. While the stories are different, the setting is always the library and there are subtle connections between the tales if you pay attention to details. In the beginning they show fake newspaper clippings by reporters like ""Molly Hatchet."" There are all kinds of little things to watch out for.

Yes there was killing and blood. The stories were supposed to be an experiment in tales of fear, but as such they were light, as a Creep Show episode, just shorter and no dead muppet to tell us a pun. Roni Jonah, Jason Crowe, and Jim O'Rear have appeared in a number of ""B' films together. They lead a core of solid acting for the genre.

One episode was done in black and white. P.J. Starks imitates John Goodman (The Big Lebowski) in one scene. Good anthology if you like ""Creep Show"" stuff.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1465084800,2,994,4.511111111111111
