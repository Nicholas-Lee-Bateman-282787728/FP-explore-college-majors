7498872,5,B017DO6NQ0,Finally this film has been released. It is lovely to see films like this available on dvd. Jane Powell was a beautiful actress. Anamorphic widescreen too.,1455321600,5,154,4.961538461538462
7498873,4,B017DO6NQ0,"A campy fun picture.  Hedy give a good performance, Jane Powell over does it big time and George Nader tries hard.  Good picture (in widescreen and crisp b&W) and audio.  Thanks Universal.",1450137600,7,188,4.8125
8738719,5,B017DO6NQ0,"Wonderfully terrible! No cliche is left unturned as this melodrama spins out its Hollywood-based story. Lamarr was still stunning (and mostly stone faced) as the mother of Jane Powell (!), and Jan Sterling is bitchy fun as a nosy Hollywood ""friend."" And if you like 1950's Hollywood hunks, they didn't come any hunkier than George Nader, who plays the minor actor who saves Lamar from a nasty accident, and becomes the lover of both her and her stepdaughter Powell. Altogether lots of fun, and love the black-and-white Cinemascope!",1511654400,,531,5.045454545454546
8738720,3,B017DO6NQ0,"Wikipedia helped shed a good deal of light regarding this mediocre but still interesting 1958 motion picture . Evidently this was Hedy Lamarr's last film after several decades in the film industry . She was about 44 years of age here . Ms. Lamarr portrays an unmarried and fundamentally benign lush film star who's wealthy and lives with her adopted daughter . Portrayed by the beautiful Jane Powell , about 28 years of age at this time , the daughter is a good girl who is a bit lonely as well (inexplicably) and likes to tie-one-on too . Mom encounters a strikingly physically fit , ostensibly younger fellow in the person of George Nader . George was about 37 years at the time of the film's release . The set up is simple . Mom wants the hunky younger fellow to be her kept man . An aspiring actor as well , this doesn't sit too well with the profoundly conflicted and frequently mute fellow because mom is loaded but sports a hideous hairdo and is not particularly fetching . After some time , the fellow encounters the drunken daughter in a chance meeting . He's unaware the younger lady is the older lady's adopted daughter . Who will the fellow cleave to ? You'll have to watch to find out .",1509148800,,1199,4.405405405405405

8738723,5,B017DO6NQ0,GOOD MOVIE FOR  HEDY LAMARR FANS . ONE OF HER LAST FILMS.,1481241600,,57,3.75
8738724,3,B017DO6NQ0,"This is one of the last Jane Powell films to be released on DVD. I can see why. It's a total Soap Opera of a movie. Jane gets the rotten part of being a spoiled brat daughter of Hedy Lamar. Both her and Hedy vie for the affection of George Nader. I bought this film for the one ""sexy & hot"" scene Jane has in a ""Polka Dot"" Swimsuit! She wears it to seduce George Nader. The part where she says ""You Know You Want To"" was incredibly sexy. I think Jane could have had a longer career in films if someone would have given her another chance at a part where she played a sexier woman. The three stars I give it is for the Jane Powell scene in the swimsuit! Jane had a great pair of legs. Check out 3 Sailors and a Girl to see Jane in her sexiest costumes she ever wore on film.",1480291200,2,773,3.8987341772151898
8738725,3,B017DO6NQ0,"Savaged by the critics upon its release,this peek at the steamy life-style of Hollywood's glamorous people isn't nearly as bad as I remembered it. Apart from a couple of moments where the acting of both the female stars is less than impressive, ""The Female Animal"" fares quite well, with a fine cameo performance by Jan Sterling. As a long time fan of Jane Powell I have waited patiently for sixty years for  this film to emerge from the vaults and gratefully welcome its release. The black and white Cinemascope print is fine.",1480032000,,527,4.728260869565218
8738726,2,B017DO6NQ0,"With this cast, you'd expect a little more than a C-grade mishmash of all the 'behind the scenes Hollywood tell-alls' you've ever been embarrassed by.  Universal didn't do too badly in presenting other vehicles for fugitive and falling MGM stars.  ""Unguarded Moment""  featured Esther Williams in a creditable and entertaining thriller.  They blessed Debbie Reynolds with ""Tammy"".  Here, they've cast Hedy as a sort of cut-rate Norma Desmond, moping around with a thinly disguised cardboard cut-out gigolo, coping with a rebellious (adopted) daughter, energetically played by Jane Powell trying to break the mold of ""The Girl Next Door"" but unfortunately, a bit too mature to fit the character.  They all thresh around a bit, but it doesn't amount to much.  More ""Cinema Dire"" than ""Noire""",1470441600,,788,5.256
8738727,5,B017DO6NQ0,"The Fermale Animal was released in 1958. Starring George Nader as a studio extra, who saves a movie star from being hurt in an accident.  Man what a hunk ! She and her daughter fight over him. It is a camp fest ! You won't believe how these women act ! A really fun film from the Golden Age Of Hollywood ! Good support from Jan Sterling, as a former child star. The dialogue is hilarious at times. I hope that Universal keeps releasing these gems, Ones I'd love to get are Flood Tide, Appointment With A Shadow, Joe Butterfly, Man Afraid, Four Girls In Town, Congo Crossing, The Second Greatest Sex, Six Bridges To Cross, and Four Guns To The Border. Fans of campy films, and  George Nader will like this the most.",1463356800,3,714,4.32089552238806
8738728,5,B017DO6NQ0,"I usually do not like Hedy Lamarr, but she is very good in this one. She underplays the part and I believed her in it. Jane is not the usually perkey little girl. She shows she can act. The picture quality is very good and so is the sound.",1458518400,4,239,3.8979591836734695
