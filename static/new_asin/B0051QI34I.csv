8619869,1,B0051QI34I,Their was only one hot girl on the whole video and they only showed her for a couple of min. DO not buy this DVD,1359849600,3,112,3.52
8619870,2,B0051QI34I,"First of all, total false advertisement in what's insinuated by the package design. ""Biggest Busts and Best Buns""? The ""biggest busts"" is a reference not to breasts--in fact only two women expose theirs in this godawful production until the last five minutes, during which you'll see four more pairs of breasts rapid-fire--but to arrests. Except there are no actual arrests either. Not that any viewer like me would care about that anyway; I bought this because it's a Wild Party Girls label, except that as it turns out there IS no wild party (or a party of any caliber for that matter) and hardly any girls at all.

""Best Buns""? Hardly any buttocks to be found. The girl on the cover is REALLY hot and had she actually appeared anywhere in the production, it might have been a trifle better. This is a DVD about illegal street racing, but I doubt, even if you're in that very narrow demographic that would watch a DVD about that kind of thing, that you would enjoy this. Bad production values, bad camerawork, total darkness, lots of running around trying to get away with petty crime. Junk.

The few girls who do show up are pretty hot, but all that you see is: 1) Some sort of bizarre g-string contest at a car show, during which none of the women actually expose bare flesh; 2) a model who gets topless only in a few public places; 3) a very cute amateur who flashes top front three times and bottom back once; 4) three or four other women who flash breasts once each.

I recommend passing on this one.",1358121600,3,1507,4.492700729927007
