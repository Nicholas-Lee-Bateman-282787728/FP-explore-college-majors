5554513,5,B00B3MQBB6,It came the following day. That was really fast. I bought this for my friend as a Christmas present. She is a big fan of the show so I know she definitely will love this. :),1384560000,,173,3.8333333333333335
5554514,5,B00B3MQBB6,"When I saw in my TV guide a half hour show called How I Met Your Mother I thought it was just plain stupid. I watched one episode but there were other things I wanted to see more; on tv and in my DVD collection of movies and tv series.. In any event I kept hearing about this show and wondered if maybe I was crazy. I have a good many tv complete series and so far all the ones I never heard of - but bought - have been crazy good.....I took the leap and ordered all seasons available for How I Met Your Mother and I've gotta' say the show is terrific. There are not many shows that I will laugh out loud watching but this one was a doozy.  I'm only at the end of the second season but I am really loving the show (I wouldn't have believed it).
I've always loved Neil Patrick Harris ever since he was in Doogie Houser where he played an 11 or 12  year old genius who went through medical school and was a bonified doctor before he ever got to his teens. If you never saw the show (I  think it was just ''Doogie Houser'') you'll see he has the same exact face he did all those years ago and has developed so much more talent since then. I still picture him as that little boy but he is a fantastic, awesome, and spectacular 'Barney.'
I have seen (ordered) so many tv series that I've just heard about and I really haven't been disappointed in any of them.
So Doogie--you still steal my heart and Alyson and the others are a perfect fit!
If you haven't seen the show, give it some time--you'll be as pleased as I was (and who knew????).",1380931200,5,1534,4.0561056105610565

8562137,5,B00B3MQBB6,"I love the show. It is flawless, but 20th Century Fox used the absolute cheapest packaging known to man. Four of the seven DVDs arrived with the insides of the cases already broken, the discs flopping around loose inside. Thankfully none of the discs were damaged as far as playability goes, but the cases are unusable which doesn't really make me happy.",1401408000,,354,4.725806451612903
8562138,5,B00B3MQBB6,Fast shipping. All discs play great. I'm a little suspicious that a couple seasons are copies. Inside cover has a pic from a different movie that Marshall is in. Not a huge deal. At least they all play through! Great for the price! Thanks,1389484800,,238,4.431818181818182
8562139,5,B00B3MQBB6,We love this show and we are pleased with the deal we got on this lightening deal!  Now even if netflix drops it we will be able to watch our beloved reruns :),1389139200,,159,3.8181818181818183

8562141,5,B00B3MQBB6,lots of time to watch the old episodes and enjoy the ones that I missed.  It has been a lot of fun to do on a winter's day.,1387238400,,123,3.392857142857143
8562142,5,B00B3MQBB6,"We LOVE HIMYM so I couldn't turn down this collection when I saw the lightening deal price!  Even though we already own the 1st season, I still purchased it with this collection because it was so much cheaper.  Each season comes as the individual season (there isn't a larger box that all the seasons go into).",1385942400,,310,4.517857142857143
