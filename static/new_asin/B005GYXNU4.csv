8472504,2,B005GYXNU4,"I purchase all of these spagetti western collections I can find ,however this one is a let down most of the films have very bad video and audio and are not that good of a movie anyway,at least one film Beyond The Law keeps switching back and forth from English to Italian ,most of the better films here are included on other better collections.",1361491200,12,344,4.390625
8472505,5,B005GYXNU4,"I'm only halfway through the 16 films and it's already worth the purchase price.  This is a great introduction to the Spaghetti Western genre.  Assuming, that is, that the viewer has a high tolerance for all the quirks that make these films such a pleasure to watch.  The acting, the dialogue, the stunts, the plots, the soundtracks, so much of it is inconsistent and off-kilter. Even the film quality varies from great to somewhat degraded (the color, that is).  All of this is what makes this box set fun.  It is also interesting to see the Spanish countryside substituting for the American West (though as one reviewer has pointed out, at least one of these films was made in Arizona).  Anyone who has visited Spain, and Almeria in particular, will enjoy noting the differences between this landscape and the landscape of the American West. This box set succeeds on many levels. Highly enjoyable, highly recommended.  .",1353369600,18,922,4.871794871794871
8472506,4,B005GYXNU4,"A fistful of bullets is bulletproof when there's that many movies for under 10 bucks.  It's advertised as 16 spaghetti westerns.  But the second flick was made in Arizona and has nothing to do with spaghetti, Italy, Italians, or good movie-making.",1345334400,7,247,5.0
