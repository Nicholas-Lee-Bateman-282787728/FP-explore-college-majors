8347577,5,B001X22XJA,"Great tunes from one of my favorite musicians. Not for beginners, no hand holding here Bromberg is not a great teacher like Woody Mann but does walk you through his tunes well enough that with the tab you will end up with some really great tunes under your belt. Worth the price just for his performances on this DVD.",1478390400,,317,4.389830508474576
8347578,3,B001X22XJA,"He loves it.  Wants all of the lessons this man has available.  I hope that friend learns to play better guitar, as it was painful to listen to before.",1382659200,,151,4.172413793103448
8347579,5,B001X22XJA,"Something for everyone here  A goal for the beginner, lessons and aspiration for the intermediate and a master class for the advanced fingerstyle singer guitar player.  The DVD also viewable as an ""In house"" concert with commentary.  I just wish he would publish Demon in Disguise.  As always his choice of material and delivery with vocals and instrumentation are impeccable.  Included tab adequate,I recommend.",1293580800,4,412,5.375
8347580,5,B001X22XJA,"Everyone will enjoy this DVD. Lots of good advice and teaching for those who can want a lesson. Fun to watch the amazing guitar artistry. No rock star attitude in David, he seems like a down to earth fellow.",1252713600,3,207,4.333333333333333
8347581,5,B001X22XJA,"Dave Bromberg has been an inspiration to me for the last 30+ years, both for his outrageous musical talent and his personal integrity, and this instructional DVD and its companion performance DVD are together a great showcase for David's amazing guitar playing.  It is also a great advertisement for the Bromberg signature Martin guitar; I had an opportunity to play one recently and it was one of the finest guitars I have ever played.  Please tour more David, come to the midwest occasionally...",1250208000,6,497,4.975903614457831
