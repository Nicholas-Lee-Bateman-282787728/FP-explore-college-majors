1787320,1,B00006RCLR,"This is a made for TV movie with a made for TV cast.  If you want to watch a movie like this just set your DVR to record anything on LMN and you will get the same result.  Don't pay to watch this movie, you can get versions of it all day long for free.  I recognized a lot of the cast from tv shows and must say the ones I recognized were better in their more recent TV rolls.  Don't waste your time.",1341532800,2,400,3.7261904761904763
1787321,2,B00006RCLR,"This movie was both boring and way too complicated in a way that didn't make sense. The acting was tepid at best, probably because the screenplay was a huge yawn. The production looked cheap, and the female protagonist was usually dressed like she was going to some yuppiefied cocktail party, whether or not she actually was doing so. I suppose it's better than staring at the wall, or picking at your nails, but I can think of a lot of better ways to spend your time than watching this movie.",1332720000,,493,4.488888888888889
1787322,5,B00006RCLR,"This was a great thriller. It has this 1980s quality to it -- which means it does not rely on special effects and blood splatter to pull in the viewer. Instead, it works due to good writing and acting. I am surprised that it does not have more reviews. This is a very entertaining film. I am now going to watch the others in the series.

The only criticism I could offer is that there were so many characters in this film that it was difficult to keep the names together. Perhaps the other shows introduce the characters; I didn't know it was  series until doing some web research. This is only a minor flaw.",1322438400,7,608,4.278260869565218
1787323,3,B00006RCLR,"This product came a day late, and had the longest time to ship when ordered (3 other items from various vendors, including Amazon, arrived earlier than the promised date).  The DVD arrived in good condition.",1171238400,2,207,4.914285714285715
1787324,5,B00006RCLR,"Like the person before me, I too like this movie and thought that Victor was great. I have only two of CRIMINAL INSTINCT series and wish I could get the rest.

If you are a Victor Garber fan I highly recommend this movie.",1142812800,9,221,4.1395348837209305
1787325,4,B00006RCLR,"One of the four movies in the 'Joanne Kilbourne Mysteries', A COLDER KIND OF DEATH is a competent little thriller.  Wendy Crewson returns as Kilbourne, who is shocked when the murderer of her husband is finally caught after six years.  The accused professes his innocence, but in vain when a sniper kills him on the way out of the police station.  Who is responsible and why did they kill him.  The accused also has a malicious wife, played with seething venom by Kari Matchett, who suggests she had an affair with the late Mr. Kilbourne.  The suspects include a cache of politically motivated friends, including Oscar nominee Teri Garr (from TOOTSIE).

Brad Turner keeps his direction crisp, and the performances overall are very good.  Victor Garber (now on ABC's ALIAS) has a solid presence as Kilbourne's ex-partner.

I've enjoyed the three of these movies I've viewed so far; they're intelligent and good mysteries.",1110499200,19,920,4.967320261437909

7972477,2,B00006RCLR,"I was very disappointed. The movie was very predictable, and slow paced. The storyline was weak. the cost of the movie was not worth it.",1398297600,,136,4.48
7972478,2,B00006RCLR,"The best thing about the movie, is its title. Based on the name, I thought it would be good.  While the synopsis is intriguing; in all actuality, A COLDER KIND OF DEATH is a mediocre, made-for-TV movie.  The actors are not believable, and the story is slow and uninteresting.  No need to mention, a pitiful soundtrack. I don't like this movie, and will not recommend it to anyone looking for entertainment.  In fact, two stars is an over rating - but 1 1/2 isn't an option..",1390608000,,474,4.476744186046512
7972479,4,B00006RCLR,"If you liked the other Joanne Kilbourne movies, you'll like this one too.  Wendy Crewson gives a good performance as Joanne Kilbourne and the storyline has some good twists in it.",1380931200,,179,4.774193548387097
7972480,1,B00006RCLR,"A GOOD CAST WAS VICTIMIZED BY AN ABSOLUTELY AWFUL SCRIPT. Laurence Olivier, Helen Hayes and all the kings men could not have saved this turkey!",1372982400,,143,4.76

7972482,3,B00006RCLR,"Although the story has depth and could have been a very good movie, this is not it. From the soundtrack to the acting by Victor Garber, the movie just does not have the intensity of a murder mystery. I realize (now) that it was made for television, but even knowing that does not help improve my opinion. Perhaps not having cable or satellite in our home for the past 15 years has raised my expectations for made-for-tv movies to a level that is too high.",1367625600,,455,4.364705882352941
7972483,4,B00006RCLR,I enjoy murdery mysteries and this one is no exception.  I could not figure out who was responsible till the very last few minutes and then only because they spell it out for you.  If you like movies with twists and turns this is a good one.,1364860800,,241,4.1063829787234045
7972484,4,B00006RCLR,A good mystery. It was well written .  The characters were believable and they played their characters well. I would watch it again.,1363737600,,132,4.739130434782608
7972485,4,B00006RCLR,"I saw this when it first aired on television and really enjoyed it.  Wendy Crewson and Victor Garber have a good chemistry.  When I saw it listed on Amazon Prime, I watched it again recently.  Still enjoyable.",1350691200,,209,4.594594594594595
