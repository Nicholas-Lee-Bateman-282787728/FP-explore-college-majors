3901414,5,B002BYNGFE,"I had not seen this show since it first aired in the early-mid 90's and even back then as a kid i recognized it's great characters, well written stories and superb action. I had seen the Arnold movies of the 80's and enjyoed them but it wasn't really until i saw the animated show where i really became a huge fan. I just ordered this set and the second set and am anxiously awaiting their arrival, i know both sets claim to be the entire series but i rememebr there was a spin-off or something where Conan was teamed up with kids or something but i believe it was short-lived, anyway buy these sets!",1262822400,5,600,4.271929824561403
3901415,5,B002BYNGFE,"Even though the show ran for several years, it was definitely one of the most underrated cartoons of the era. Unlinke most toons during that era, it actually had continuity with a great story. The story begins with the evil wizard Wrathamon (while conquering villages for his master Sett)placing a spell on Conan's parents & grandfather. The spell turned them to ""living stone."" As such Conan, with the aid of new allies embarks upon a quest to undo the spell and save the world from Sett.

8362512,5,B002BYNGFE,"Hardly anybody remembers this series when it was on the air and they missed a good thing. This is a watered down Conan  but is more noble,with parents who get turned to stone by a snake man who is a maniac. His friends include an African prince who can communicate and enlist aid from animals,who becomes his blood brother;Jasmine,a love interest,acrobat not a damsel in distress;Greywolf, an elemental sorcerer whose wolves are his older brother and sister cursed in these forms; His pet phoenix,Needle gives comic relief by referring to him as ""big,dumb barbarian.""The stories are imaginative, and the build up to the showdown with Wrath-Ammon and the god Set is well planned and executed. If you are a fan of Conan whether novels,comic books or movies should be able to get into this series. They kept the heart of Conan and expanded. Well worth the time and money.",1397606400,,868,4.825503355704698
8362513,4,B002BYNGFE,"This was a cartoon that came on early in the morning when I was a kid. Story revolves around Conan and his companions searching for star metal to fight snake people.  Isn't formatted for HD tvs, but still looks good despite age.",1390003200,,228,4.428571428571429
8362514,5,B002BYNGFE,This was a great well done series from the 90's I believe. The episodes are fairly wholesome and not all the same so If your looking for something for the kids to watch. Its alot like He-man.,1371686400,,191,4.1891891891891895
8362515,3,B002BYNGFE,"I love this cartoon, but this DVD sets picture quality is very poor. I'm glad I own it but it has now been released as multiple DVDs. I wonder if the quality is better on those. If so I think the added cost of buying individual DVDs for a better quality picture is definitely worth it. That's what I would have done had I had the option at the time. Still, absolutely a great cartoon.",1334534400,,384,4.133333333333334
8362516,5,B002BYNGFE,"After having seen twenty-three episodes, I'm quite pleased, and my kids are also.  Conan the Adventurer has surprising depth during individual episodes and traverses an interesting setting over a broader storyline.  I only saw a bit of it when I was younger but even then I got the impression then that each episode was part of a larger story.

The characters are well-done and it's nice to see the protagonist allied with others who are genuinely proficient at their crafts, as opposed to other stories where everyone is just beginning to learn how to use their powers or skills--maturation of skill is largey set aside in favor of better story elements.  Conan's friends are present in different mixes, and while their absence isn't always explained, it's not really a problem.  Recurring villains are similarly used, and the central villain, Wrath-Amon, is powerful and evil while being plausibly vulnerable.  Needle, the potential downfall of the series as a cutesy sidekick, is actually not annoying and he does add to the story.

A lot of the storyline revolves around magic and magical items; this is usually pretty interesting.  Sometimes it seems there's a bit too much focus on starmetal, but that element is crucial to the series.  Though there is plenty of fighting, the combat with the common villains, serpentmen, has no blood aspect to it as they are banished to another dimension instead of being killed.

Conan the Adventurer is fun and is the definitive Conan story for me.",1324857600,3,1491,4.975806451612903
8362517,5,B002BYNGFE,"I grew up enjoying the Conan the Barbarian Movie with Arnold Schwarzenagger as a Cimmerian Hero, so I would be interested in Conan comics. Now I will see the animated tale of Robert E Howard's barbarian-Conan the Adventurer on DVD! It will be my favorite and my video treasure for days to come.",1304294400,,294,4.566037735849057
8362518,5,B002BYNGFE,"This set is awesome ,really takes me back to my good days! Also me and my husband have spent many great hours together enjoying this great cartoon series. We wish they still made em like this...a great find! Thank you for keeping the spirit of Conan alive, lol!",1300492800,,261,4.458333333333333
8362519,2,B002BYNGFE,"First let me say that I am a fan of Robert E Howard, Conan's creator, and have collected his works for a good 30 plus years. SO... I tend to collect the movies also. That said, this cartoon series is for the Conan fanatic hardcore geek collector. Like me. Definately aimed at the Saturday morning teen (or earlier) crowd, they faetured a watered down Conan, complete with sidekicks and a THEME SONG. Still, they are a bit charming if you can adjust your viewing level to fit the medium.",1270771200,2,486,4.47191011235955
8362520,5,B002BYNGFE,"Even though this DVD set seems cheaply produced, it is still great to have it on DVD, since my VHS tapes were wearing thin. The quality is definitely not digital, but its as good as you can expect since the original tapes were probably never remastered. Overall, I consider this a good buy if you are a fan of this cartoon.",1265760000,5,323,4.311475409836065
