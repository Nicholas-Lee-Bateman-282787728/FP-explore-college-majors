8440711,1,B004TH77MO,"I was looking forward to receiving a DVD with extensive scenery of Iguazu Falls.

This is a 10th rate production with scenes repeated over and over and includes extensive coverage of the garbage collection area.

This production has no redeeming value that I could determine.

Amazon should consider removing this DVD from its stock.",1324080000,3,333,5.12962962962963
