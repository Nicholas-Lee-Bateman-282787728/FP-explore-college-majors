7923035,4,B00004TQ13,"""A Woman's Guide To Firearms"" is a good starting point for both women and men interested in learning the basics of pistol safety and shooting. Brief mention is made of shotguns and rifles, but the main focus is on revolvers and semi-auto handguns. The video was made in 1987 and the production elements reflect that time frame, with cheesy music, big hair, and subtly condescending in places, but otherwise far better than many other instructional videos.

This is loosely shot as a story, following Lee Purcell as she goes from frightened novice to confident shooter. Narration is provided by Gerald McRaney (Major Dad, etc) and there are cameos by Geoffrey Lewis (character actor) and several competition shooters. The actual instruction is provided by Mickey Fowler and Mike Dalton, both of which do a great job explaining the safety rules, types of handguns, and proper handling and firing techniques.

This is available on DVD as well, which is how I saw it.

7923036,5,B00004TQ13,"This video, though a little corny, is for anyone thinking of owning a handgun for self defense but doesn't have the knowledge of how to start. Don't be stupid and buy a gun and then try to figure out how to use it on your own. This video is less about the details and more about telling the newbie how to get motivated and where to go for their first experience.

I think starting with a .38 special revolver and getting professional personal instruction as shown in the video is a great way to start. Also as shown in the video, if a person isn't intimidated and is instructed in a calm and confident inspiring way the sky is the limit and soon guns become a healthy hobby as well as a tool for personal defense.

The women in my family have seen it and I loan to anyone that's interested.",1144627200,,790,4.225165562913907
7923037,5,B00004TQ13,"This video lets you follow Lee Purcell through an introductory class as you learn, along with her, the basics of safe gun handling and use.
You get good, easy-to-understand explanations of how revolvers and  semiautomatic pistols operate, how to select ammunition that's right for  your gun and of the basics of shooting:  stance, sight alignment, trigger  control, etc.  Most important, you'll walk away knowing the safety rules  that'll ensure a safe and enjoyable introduction to the sport.
There are  no chase scenes or explosions, nobody gets the girl at the end, and I doubt  it'll ever get an Academy Award, but if you're just getting started in  shooting, this highly informative tape is hard to beat.",961632000,7,709,5.043103448275862
