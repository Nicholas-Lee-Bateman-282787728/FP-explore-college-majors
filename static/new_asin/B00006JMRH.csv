1781467,5,B00006JMRH,"This is definately my favorite movie of all time. It explores the idea of the ""price of love"", and what a person is  truly willing to do to  please the person he/she loves. Overall, a must see comically romantic movie.",1050105600,5,218,4.425
1781468,4,B00006JMRH,"""The Price Of Milk"", a charming, quirky modern day fairy tale for adults set in the beautiful green rolling hills of rural North Island New Zealand, teaches the age old lesson (in a easy going, pleasant way) that sacrifice holds the key to love.
Shot in a magic realistic style that is somewhat reminiscent of ""Like Water For Chocolate"" and some of Brunel's more lyrical works, ""The Price Of Milk"" is a fun, quirky, symbollic film that blurs the lines between dream time and waking.
The actors are charming and utterly believable as is the mysterious ""Mrs. Jackson"", an Indian trickster that drives the narrative.
""The Price Of Milk"" is a fine love letter to all couples. We must all give up something to keep together. This is a small, quiet film to love and cherish.",1041724800,14,768,4.654411764705882
1781489,4,B00006JMRH,I just love this movie and I cant figure out why. Its silly but funny and romantic and it cracks me up.,1383523200,,103,3.727272727272727
1781490,4,B00006JMRH,I came across this movie years ago when I was in my foreign movie phase. This is set in New Zealand. Now about this movie I can't really explain. My take is that there's a couple who live in the country side and raise cows. She wants excitement in the relationship so she does certain things to try to get her fianc mad but she takes it too far and suddenly things get weirder from there. Its so messed up but I love this movie anyway. There's something so bazaar and sweet at the same time. Especially the scenery in this movie showing how beautiful New Zealand is.,1382572800,,566,4.25
1781491,5,B00006JMRH,"As stated before on some other reviews, I am a big Karl Urban fan.  He has got such great range that you don't always get to see in his action movies.  This is a cute, quirky little romance that he did in his native New Zealand.  Karl is the main love interest and his girlfriend/fiancee in the movie loses something that she believes is important to her.  She makes a deal to get it back and ends up ruining her relationship with Karl's character which is when she realizes he is what she really wants and she works to get him back.  The entire movie is entertaining and funny but the agoraphobic dog is the best.",1379635200,,614,4.258620689655173
1781492,5,B00006JMRH,Fun and very original. New Zealand film making at it's best. A weird comedy that is kinda dream like. Fun for all adults with a kid spirit still left in them.,1371427200,,158,4.129032258064516
1781493,5,B00006JMRH,if you are a fan of other than big productions - you will appreciate this cute kiwi film. the characters are sweet too.,1357516800,,119,4.217391304347826
1781494,5,B00006JMRH,"This movie is truly beautiful in so many ways.  The New Zealand cinematography is spectacular and sets the fairy tale, the music from the Moscow Symphony is enchanting and haunting, and the symbolism abounds.  There are a couple of morals to this fairy tale that weave through the movie: 1) Love what you have because you never know when it won't be there anymore and 2) What price will you pay for love.  Karl Urban and Daniele McCormack work well together (they also did Xena and Via Satellite together) and are off kilter just enough to keep the whimsy going in the movie.  Please watch this movie as a fairy tale and romantic comedy.  It is weird--an agoraphophic dog???, playful, and surreal.  It is more like art and should be enjoyed that way.",1311033600,,750,4.601503759398496
1781495,4,B00006JMRH,"Although I wish this had been the earlier New Yorker video version of the film which had the commentary included on it, I was grateful to get this because it is, sadly, now out of print.  This is one of those little weird gems that one can't help but giggle at when watching.  Everything from the agoraphobic dog to the swapping of the cows for the quilt make this an adult fairy tale.  The addition of the Maori people and the Indian culture make it even more surreal and universal.  Too bad little tid bits like this are not valued more.  Harry Sinclair is quite a wit and there is definitely magic afoot in this wonderful little film. Danielle Cormack is absolutely gorgeous in a homespun sort of way and the unkempt hilarity of Karl Urban's performance is absolutely magic.  No wonder Urban has gone on to bigger and better things. He is quite the actor.  Check this out, even if you get it from Netflix. It is subtle and brilliant.",1255219200,,936,4.43859649122807
1781496,4,B00006JMRH,"At the beginning of ""The Little Prince"", an aviator lost in a desert draws a picture of a sheep for a demanding young man appeared from nowhere. When a mystery is too overpowering, the aviator observed, one dare not disobey.

It is this magical mystery, I believe, which invigorates this quirky film.
Of course, ""The Little Prince"" remains utterly charming throughout; ""The Price of Milk"", at times, is just utterly odd.

But, despite its oddness--no, despite its e..x..a..g..g..e..r..a..t..e..d oddness--I found myself charmed. I found myself saying: oh hell, stop being an old nelly, this is a love story; let them eat and bathe and do dishes and get engaged all at once, all in one bathtub.
oh hell, stop worrying about conventions, this is a love story; let there be little, big putting Jacksons populating the movie. . .let there be a dog so socially challenged he runs about in a box. . .let there be impossible car crashes which shooty up-too-high-in-the-sky house trailers. . .

I think this movie is simply trying to convey what it should feel like to be young and in love. And if I'm too old and too cynical to understand it all, well, shame on my imagination.

I am not too old--never will be too old--to see the magic and appreciate the beauty of the colors from some remarkable shots. . .what cinematography!
Forget the oddness of a swimmer in a vat of milk--look at that white, look at the garish bathing cap, look at that pretty woman. . .
Forget the impossible long tail of the Indian wedding gown--look at the brillant red slash against the green, green hill. . .
Forget the silliness of a woman crawling through a large heating duct impossibly appearing in an open field--look at the radiance of that beautiful young face again, now encircled in chrome. . .

Already, in reviewing, I miss the film. . .as I miss being young and in love. . .",1226448000,2,1858,4.635258358662614
1781497,4,B00006JMRH,"I am a huge fan of Karl Urban. I am buying any and all DVDs I can lay my hands on in which he appears.

I don't think I am alone when I say, ""WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE??",1217548800,,175,3.268292682926829
1781498,2,B00006JMRH,"A strange yet sweet love story of 2 simple folk.

The landscapes and colors are beautiful and vibrant.

The acting was OK.

But there were twists in the story that only a stoner would come up with!",1217376000,,197,4.27027027027027
1781509,5,B00006JMRH,"I remember hearing about this film when it came out in 2000 mostly because the two leading actors, Karl Urban & Danielle Cormack, were frequent guest stars on ""Xena: Warrior Princess.""  Although a fan of both stars and their native New Zealand, I never saw ""The Price of Milk"" then; and it disappeared from memory until a recent Karl Urban movie kick.  What a mistake on my part!  This is a delightful, charming film with excellent performances by both Urban and Cormack set against stunningly lush New Zealand scenery.  Be warned that this movie is not a straight forward romantic-comedy (which is truly part of its charm); it is part fantasy, with elements of magic and local folklore that you would never get in an American film. It also deals with romance beyond ""happily ever after,"" exploring what happens when an established relationship starts to lose its spark.  In the end, if you are looking for a wonderfully endearing foreign indie film, give ""The Price of Milk"" a chance to win you over.  You will not be disappointed!",1215820800,,1032,4.769662921348314
1781510,4,B00006JMRH,"There's a curse, cows, a quilt, a ring, a weird old lady in a fuzzy pink hat, a messed-up dog, a bunch of golfing men, and two very confused lovers.

This describes ""The Price of Milk,"" a colourful New Zealand fable that is half love story, half modern fairy tale, and full of beauty, wackiness and surreally fantastical touches. It's a very quirky little film, and somehow writer/director Harry Sinclair never lets it become too acutely precious.

Rob (Karl Urban) and Lucinda (Danielle Cormack) live in an idyllic dairy farm in the middle of New Zealand, and are blissfully happy. One day, while they're washing the dishes in the tub, Rob slips Lucinda an emerald engagement ring. But Lucinda confesses to her pal Drosophila (Willa O'Neill) that she's worried about the spark going out of their relationship, and Drosophila advises her to test Rob's love.

And Lucinda is further distracted when the quilt is stolen from their bed by a band of strange Maori men. When she spots it later, a strange old lady (Rangi Motu) has it, and is only willing to trade it for something precious. The next morning, Rob wakes to find that his one hundred and seventeen cows have vanished without a trace -- turns out Lucinda traded it for the quilt. Naturally, he's very upset, and moves into a pal's garage.

Lucinda vows to somehow get the cows back, but the old woman will only accept ""what you love most."" Desperate, Lucinda agrees, and the cows are returned -- but now she's sacrificed their relationship, and her secret dreams. As the cunning Drosiphila schemes to seduce and  marry Rob, Lucinda must come to terms with how selfish she has been, and how much she truly loves him.

Writer-director Harry Sinclair -- best known for playing Isildur in ""Lord of the Rings"" -- knows how to make a really striking little movie, even on a very low bidget. He clothes this fairy tale in the rolling lush hills and jungles of New Zealand, colourful clothes, and a surrealistic edge (consider the baby feet in a sea of floating milk, or the cows in Indian wedding garb).

And the list of quirks goes on: a suitcase of baby shoes, steel ivy, a house full of milk, a bathtub full of tears, old Maori women under six feet of quilts, superhuman accidents, silver pipelines, and the occasional conversation held in an upside-down car.

Yeah, Sinclair wrings every last drop of magical realism out of this story, but it's not just a conceit -- without it, the plot wouldn't work as well as it does. That magic turns Lucinda's attempts to repair her selfish error into a fairy tale quest to restore her lover, despite the machinations of the town-bike Drophilia.

Granted, the plot has a tendency to wander, particularly when the wedding subplot is introduced. But it has lots of tongue-in-cheek moments like the Seven-Dwarves-like band of Maori men, and the agoraphobic dog-in-a-box. One bizarre scene has Lucinda accidentally running over the old lady. And Sinclair weaves in some bittersweetly romantic moment, like Lucinda's midnight visits to Rob's garage, or her wails of ""I do!"" in the jungle.

Cormack does a brilliant job -- Lucinda is is a bit crazy and initially selfish, but you start feeling sorry for her as she tries to fix things. Yeah, it's her fault, but at least she improves. Urban is sweet, earthy and adorable -- though prone to a few mistakes of his own -- while O'Neill is gloriously nasty. And the golfing nephews (including Lawrence Makoare) are a riot, as is Motu as the witchy old lady.

Quirky, whimsical, adorable and romantic, ""The Price of Milk"" is a brilliant example of New Zealand's highly underrated cinema. In between the low-budget movie magic, you get to see what the price of love is.",1203811200,2,3701,4.749221183800623
1781511,4,B00006JMRH,"This is a very unusual movie, full of quirky characters and surreal circumstances. I think this movie is more akin to the French movie ""Amelie"" than ""Like water for Choclate"" as one reviwer suggested. The movie is totaly refreshing and, for me, I like it even better on second viewing. I especially like the allegory of Lucinda hoarding up all the baby shoes in her suitcase. Sometimes we treasure some things so much that we forget what they really mean to us.",1170979200,2,461,4.634146341463414
1781512,5,B00006JMRH,"I have to admit, the first time I saw this movie I hated it. It sat on my shelf smugly staring at me, mocking my lack of appreciation. A few months later, I popped it in and a miracle occured - I finally ""got"" it! Since this time, I wasn't expecting ""The Price of Milk"" to fit into the typical romantic comedy mold, I was able to appreciate its own weird magic. Later, I read an article about the movie that said that the director basically made up the plot as he went along. All the pieces were finally starting to fall into place! Seriously, ""The Price of Milk"" is very surreal and also very sweet. In sum, a young couple live on a dairy farm and seem to have the perfect relationship. It takes a literal run-in with a strange woman to reveal the underlying problems between the couple. The movie asks: How much is true love worth? Is it worth giving up your most important possession? The cast is great, especially Karl Urban, who I love with an obsessive, semi-stalker kind of passion. ""The Price of Milk"" is definitely an acquired taste but, take my word for it, it does improve with time. Enjoy!",1150243200,2,1101,4.349514563106796
1781513,5,B00006JMRH,"Once i began to think of it as a ""real-life fairy tale"" i was able to really enjoy it.... think of it as symbolic and not realistic.  So artistic, creative and sweet, it will be one of my favorites for a long time.",1136764800,5,214,3.9767441860465116
1781514,5,B00006JMRH,"Friends recommended The Price of Milk, with caution.  ""Wierd"", ""strange"", ""remember it's a fairy tale.""

Well, I absolutely L-O-V-E love this movie.  Not only do we get to see the usually serious KARL URBAN, (Bourne Supremacy, Chronicles of Riddick, Lord of the Rings) being cute, silly and romantic, but we get a smart, quirky, beautifully visual film as well.

The sound track is STUNNING and I purchased it immediately.

Watch this film and escape from the real world for awhile.  You won't be disappointed.",1105401600,10,510,5.011904761904762
1781515,5,B00006JMRH,"I could throw some adjectives at this movie, but I doubt it would work. It's as if Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jane Campion had a dairy-based love child and put it on Prozac.

If you are not currently in a happy relationship, watch with caution.

The commentary track is of the 'crawl inside the filmmaker's head' variety (as opposed to the 'look at our special effects' variety).

Other points:

Full of Russian orchestra music!

Karl Urban has been added to my Amazon wishlist, but they say he's backordered. He's like a dimply funny R. Feinnes.

Agoraphobic dog in a box!

Quilting!

Character named after fruit flies!",1104451200,9,620,4.783018867924528
1781516,3,B00006JMRH,"The Price of Milk is a movie that can only be viewed on its own terms.  Strange things happen, sometimes revolving around a curse (moral: drive carefully), sometimes just because.  There's a quilt, there are cows, and there's New Zealand mysticism (or something).  Realism isn't the point.

There's a coherent plot in there somewhere, but the movie is as much a collection of unexpected events as it is a coherent narrative.  This is at first charming and cute; an early scene with Rob and Lucinda sharing a bath is particularly nice.

The amusement level is high at first, but after a while the movie just gets tiring.  After an endless parade of nonsense, I eventually started to wish that they would just get on with it and stop throwing in so many additional complications.  It is, fortunately, not very long.

There's not a lot to lose by renting the movie (I found it in the Drama section, amazingly enough), but why would anyone want to own this?  It's hard to justify repeated viewings when the whole point is that you're never quite sure what they're going to throw at you next.",1098403200,4,1087,4.643979057591623
1781517,3,B00006JMRH,"First I have to say.....I rented this because it was getting such great reviews from everyone else who watched it. And I honestly can't see why they thought it was so great. It didn't impress me all that much. It was okay; not horrible. But I would think if I were ever on an acid trip, this film is what it would be like. Somewhere between them doing dishes in the bathtub and her collection of baby shoes, I got extremely confused as to how everything really fit together. Which is too bad, because all the actors did a fairly good job with what they were given. Three out of Five stars is what this film gets from me. Its okay, but don't get your heart set on something spectacular.",1077235200,4,685,4.276923076923077
1781518,4,B00006JMRH,"Price of Milk is a contemporary fairy tale with about love where a princess is exchanged for an ordinary girl, Lucinda.  Rob, the prince, and Lucinda are happy and they are looking forward to getting married.  The happiness lasts until the day when one of Lucinda's friends tells her that men want their women more after fights.  In the process they end up getting their quilt stolen in the middle of the night, which adds to the looming predicaments. Price of Milk provides many different ideas that are presented in a surrealistic manner, which actually enhances the impact of the story.  The ideas in the story also offer entertainment as well as self-reflection and in the end awards the audience with a clever cinematic experience.",1058227200,2,736,4.864
