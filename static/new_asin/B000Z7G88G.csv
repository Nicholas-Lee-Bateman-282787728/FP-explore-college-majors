8234956,5,B000Z7G88G,"I you are fascinated by Dinosaurs, you will love this DVD.  It is actually two shows in one.  One show concerns a magnificent dinosaur mummy found in the Hell's Creek formation.  The other is a look at a conglomeration of fossils found at another site.",1379289600,,252,4.555555555555555
8234957,5,B000Z7G88G,"As with all National Geosraphics they are over too soon. These discs are longer then others, but I always want more. They are about two very exciting investigations. They leave you antiscipating (sp?) more information.",1258070400,,218,5.257142857142857
8234958,1,B000Z7G88G,If you like to watch the same thing over and over and over again this is the dvd for you.  I was very disappointed in this dvd.  Not a lot of new information.  Nova has much better dvd's on Dinosaurs.,1241654400,2,200,3.95
8234959,4,B000Z7G88G,"THese two interesting documentaries follow one another quite well.  The first, Dino Deathtrap, is a story of a huge deposit of dinosaur bones found in overlaying segments in a single location in China.  Several new to science species are uncovered.  The title is well approached in this episode.  The second episode is not so well put together and arrives at no finality.  At the end, we are left without fulfilment.  It is a spectaular find, but the science of unveiling the fossil uniqueness and what the fossil offers.  THere are many theories and speculation, but very little about the fossil comes to light.  We find out that the beasst is larger than thought, has larger legs and a much deeper pelvis than thought, but anything is speculative at this point.  A CT scan was intersting but not diagnostic.  This research is about the same point as the Iceman research was when the first video came out about it.  That said, both documentaries are interesting, with several diitalized images used to visualize certain points brought out during research.  Much of the research is yet to be done.  This introduction promises more dramatic discoveries to follow.  Worth the viewing.",1197504000,17,1182,4.934010152284264
