I have just played the CD and found it to be well done with no problems. I specifically looked for the low frequency noise that concerned another reviewer and found nothing out of the ordinary. I did notice an unobtrusive sound that seemed to be blower noise but it was not offensive to me. In order to make sure I was giving the CD a fair test I played back the music with peak sound pressure levels exceeding 98 decibels which is fairly loud but did not notice anything non-musical other than what I believe to be the blower noise. The CD has very good sound with an exciting range for the bass enthusiast.

Original review
This was a gift and I've just had the opportunity to listen to the DVD in its entirety. The audio is in 5.1 surround which is used to advantage. I watched the recital first and then watched the bonus features and would now suggest one watch the bonus features first and then watch the recital. Mr. Johnson explained the organ and its history, why he made the selections he did and how they have a special significance for the grand organ at St. Paul's Cathedral; that understanding could enhance one's enjoyment of the recital.

I found it amusing that a good part of the demonstration music is from the Harry Potter movies which I happen to enjoy. Mr Johnson is not only an excellent organist but is also a personable host for the tour of the organ; he made the tour and his discussion of the program very pleasant and enjoyable indeed.

Additional bonus features included a commentary on the ""Tuba Tune"" and the performance of a dramatic selection written by Mr. Johnson.

I have a home theater system which was designed for the reproduction of pipe organ music and it reproduced the lowest bass frequencies with no difficulty. What I failed to notice was the low frequency rumbling that concerned one reviewer; I have no explanation for that and enjoyed both the recital and the tour equally. Pipe organs can produce some noise with their blowers and associated moving parts but I did not notice any distracting sounds that interfered with the music.

If you enjoy the pipe organ this recording is one you should be sure to get!",1420761600,2,2172,4.587628865979381
8423343,5,B004CQGGMY,"Organist Simon Johnson gives absolutely fantastic performances.  But better still are his ""behind the scenes"" discussions which are wonderfully easy to listen to and quite ""down-to-earth"".  Johnson is a highly gifted organist, but you'd never guess it from his natural humility.  He dazzles you with his playing, then makes you feel at ease with his humble personality.  How refreshing it is to come across an organist whose talent isn't overshadowed by his ego!  ( Yes, one name definitely comes to mind.)

I can't recommend this video enough!",1375920000,,544,5.195402298850575
8423344,4,B004CQGGMY,"This DVD is a bargain! You get both a DVD and a CD, for one modest price. The DVD includes a complete concert, and a lecture (including demonstrations) of the organ, its history and its stops by the distinguished organist of St. Paul's. It also includes a discussion by the organist of the program material. There are extensive, wonderful scenes of St. Paul's, both inside and out. This DVD is really wonderful except for one thing: there is an excessive amount of low frequency ambient noise, consisting (most likely) of (1) sound of organ blowers, (2) sound of traffic around St. Paul's, and (3) possibly sound of heater or air conditioner. Put these low frequency noises together and you have a discernible and somewhat irritating distraction if your sound system is capable of producing low bass. I do not understand why the recording engineer did not filter out a good bit of the low frequency ambient noise. If this was not practical, for whatever reason, a brief acknowledgement and explanation of the noise would have been appropriate. In any event, this DVD is a slightly imperfect treasure - musically, visually, historically. I have no regrets about buying it. I gave the DVD a 4 star rating because of the ambient noise. Otherwise it would deserve a 5 star rating.",1328054400,3,1276,4.831050228310502
