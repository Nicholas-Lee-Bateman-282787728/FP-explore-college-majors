2720898,1,B000M341UA,"The costumes look beautiful but the dialog and acting are ridiculous. There are a lot of shooting scenes but they look so unreal that they're  funny.

I'm mad as hell because I had to pay for the rental of this film.",1182729600,4,216,4.2439024390243905
2720899,2,B000M341UA,"I picked this movie up because I love westerns. When the film started, I could tell I was in trouble as the production values seemed to be lacking and some wooden dialogue delivered during the stagecoach hold-up. Once I accepted the level of feature I was watching, I adjusted my expectations and tried to accept Hell to Pay for the low budget 60s or 70s TV western that it really is. There are some good action scenes in the film, and the old western town is authentic (there is a nice bonus feature on the DVD regarding the classic western back-lots). Lee Majors was billed as a co-star in Hell to Pay, but he really only makes a cameo. See it if you are a true oaterphile, but I can't recommend it to anyone else.",1181692800,15,716,4.311111111111111
2720900,3,B000M341UA,"I love a good western. That being said, I didn't love ""Hell To Pay"". It was o.k. and that's it. The box said it was nominated as ""...best western of 2006"", so I guess it was the only western out in 2006, and it didn't win the catagory. It had a lot of ""legendary"" western stars in it, returning for ""...a final shootout"". That was, kind of, cool but, it wasn't a whole lot different than say, ""Maverick"". A movie that I enjoyed a lot more, by the way. The dialog in ""Hell To Pay"" was written poorly, and the acting wasn't much better. I have a compulsion, at times, to count the shots taken in movie shootouts. I resisted this time but, I know more than 6 shots were taken by shooters in their scenes; a sure sign of inattentive editing or, not caring and going for the action shot. The actors, also (another pet-peeve) acted like they were shooting bb guns. No recoil even hinted at. I would think that, a movie that has SASS (Single Action Shooting Society, kind of a Creative Anachronism Society for the old west) associated with it might be more, for lack of a better term, realistic, maybe accurate works. I think it was just an excuse for SASS'ers to go out and play western, and get it on film. The main reason I purchased the movie was the purported nomination for the Golden Boot Award. I guess I should have investigated the organization that gives out this ""award"". 3 stars is being generous, It was, after all, a ""try"".",1173830400,21,1431,4.3632958801498125
2720951,1,B000M341UA,"Dull, boring, slow.  Very bad acting.  I wouldn't even rate it a B movie.  More like a D movie.",1420761600,2,95,3.8947368421052633

2720953,3,B000M341UA,"Please don't take this film seriously!  This was intended to be a 'B' movie.  So, keep that in mind while watching it or else you'll drive yourself nuts.  The script, acting and camera work were absolutely atrocious.  There's a scene where you can actually see the boom mic enter the frame!  But that what makes this movie so entertaining!  If you love a good ol' campy western, then this is for you!",1411862400,,400,4.486111111111111

2720956,3,B000M341UA,This movie was too dark for my taste. Too much voilence. I chose this because James Drury had a part in it. If you are a fan of his you will like his performance.,1370908800,3,162,3.7941176470588234
2720957,2,B000M341UA,This was by far one of the worst westerns I have ever seen. It had a bad plot and was just plain aweful.,1358121600,,104,3.5652173913043477

2720959,2,B000M341UA,"I was very disappointed in this film. The acting is way below average and the lack of much of a soundtrack...pretty much sealed this one for me. I watched the entire movie because every now and then something happens to give you hope.

That said......don't waste your time .",1239926400,3,274,4.591836734693878
2720960,5,B000M341UA,"Just a great old fashioned western.  Recognized many old stars and the new leads fill the image of the West very well.  Remember John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, James Garner, and many others?  'nuf said!!!!",1198800000,,202,4.882352941176471

8166078,1,B000M341UA,"Zero stars.  Incredibly stiff acting and stilted dialog.  I've seen better acting in high school productions.  A shame, because the story line isn't so bad and it could've been a better movie.
That being said, my husband and I get perverse pleasure from watching bad movies.  We kind of like to watch them to laugh and to see how bad they'll get.  This movie made it on our ""Top 10"" list of worst movies of all time.  We laughed out loud at several points as we reveled in how bad it is.
Warning for the squeamish:  it is a violent movie with lots of killings.  Because it's an older movie, at least they don't show gratuitous close-ups of blood gushing everywhere when someone has been shot.  They just show the body keeling over and that's it.",1499212800,,745,4.419117647058823

8166083,1,B000M341UA,"Wow!  I watched the movie last night and had to look up reviews today to see if it was supposed to be a 'tongue in cheek' western.  The dialogue, and acting were terrible.  I got the sense that someone got a bunch of their friends together and made a movie.  This might actually be the case as I believe the director also wrote the screenplay.  The only redeeming value I found was to look for ""oops"":
  Did you see the electric flicker bulb on the wall fixture in the land office?
  Is that plywood siding on the cabin?
  Where's she get that 8-shooter!?
  The clothes didn't fit - I wonder if they bought the costumes before finding the friends to wear them.
  When they did the required passionate unbuttoning scene, is that a ""this is so lame"" smile I see on her face?
The production quality was good.  It is amazing what you can do on an I-phone these days.",1424476800,3,862,4.29375
