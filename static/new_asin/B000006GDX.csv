1194442,5,B000006GDX,This movie is an excellent love story. Sally Fields showed a lot of skill in this one. This movie is a great commedy and should be a part of everyone's life.,984528000,2,157,4.096774193548387
1194473,4,B000006GDX,Every good movie.  I loved it when it came out but it wasn't as funny this time.  Love all the actors.  Sally Field was wonderful.,1510444800,,130,4.12
1194474,5,B000006GDX,cute movie!,1509753600,,11,5.0
1194475,4,B000006GDX,"This charming, nostalgic, and upscale humor film has the same director as 'To Kill A Mockingbird', who happens to be the older brother of the star of Empty Nest & Soap. It's a very old fashioned film, and was so when it was released in 1982. It's very sentimental and has an intelligent script. The humor is not obvious, you have to think about it.

Great Stars in this: Sally Field (she won a Golden Globe), James Cahn  (he hated this movie and refused to act for 5 years), Jeff Bridges (proves his acting ability as his more recent characters are nothing like this museum director type), Claire Trevor (her last film), Mildred Natwick (one of her last), and Paul Dooley.

No special features other than the trailer. Supposedly has widescreen on the flip side, but I do not notice the difference. It seemed exactly like the full screen formatted version. No black lines on top or bottom to indicate widescreen.",1508544000,,911,4.645962732919255

1194478,3,B000006GDX,The first thing about this movie is the cast.  James Caan Sally Field and Jeff Bridges are all terrific.  James Caan plays the first late husband of Sally Field.  She wants to remarry Jeff Bridges.  Caan is now a ghost living in their old house.  And only Sally Field can see him.  Which makes Jeff Bridges wonder if she is really ready to marry him or not.  It's been awhile since I've seen this.  So I don't remember exactally what the scene is.  But there is a really funny scene involving a dog and a Priest.  This is a above average romantic comedy.,1499904000,,554,4.29126213592233

I love anything with Sally Field in it. It is a comedy/romance. I miss the movies from the 70;s & 80;s where the cinematography was gorgeous and there was always some terrific song that played the movie in and out. This is one of those from back in the day... It is funny and has a great cast. The script is a bit thin in places but overall it still is a movie I will recommend. Missing the better days of comedy/romance?

1194812,5,B000006GDX,"I saw this movie when it was first released as a second feature with another film.  What a fun surprise.  The film is a modern version of such films as ""Topper"" and ""Blythe Spirit"", as Sally Field is the only one who can see the ghost of her dead husband, Jolly.

The cast is amazing, including a brief scene with the wonderful Mildred Natwick as the proprietress of a Bed & Breakfast.
Unlike the one reviewer who gave the film one star, I think the actors have much to be proud of in this little film.  Not every movie is trying to be ""Gone With The Wind"".

I recommend purchasing this movie, especially since it is so inexpensive.

1194813,3,B000006GDX,"There's a number of ""ghost"" stories like this one - all of them better scripted, This one is so cliche-ridden it's a shame the actor's talents were so wasted.

Not only is the story a sweet love story, she really finds out what a ""cad"" her dead husband was but I think James C. really as a ghost found out how much he loved her!!! Too little too late!!! But back to how I started the sentence, not only is it a sweet love story but I just LOVED the brownstone that they use to live in but has been closed up and they, Sally and Jeff redo it!!!! It is a neat place!!! I just love homes and apartments and brownstones in movies in NY!!!!",1332806400,,641,3.827067669172932

The scene in the bedroom is so funny...""They're my Aunt Edna's!"" is the line we can say anytime, anywhere and she and I will both giggle.  It's just a great movie to watch on a cold winter day...or a rainy day...or ANY day that you want to watch a movie that will make you laugh...and maybe even cry! Great acting by everyone, including the dog, Shakespeare.  I highly recommend this movie!",1327276800,,510,4.347368421052631
1194846,5,B000006GDX,"This movie just popped into my head one day and nearly drove me crazy trying to remember the name of it.  Back in the day, it was in heavy rotation on cable movie channels and I watched it seemingly a zillion times. Finally, I got on IMDB and found the name.  How great that Amazon offered it for sale and so cheap too.  It is one of James Caan's more charming offerings and Jeff Bridges takes what could have been a rather silly character and turns him into a droll, wisecracking kind of guy.  Sally Field is, well, Sally Field, but this character fits her to a ""t.""  The plot about a dead spouse whose spirit will not leave is an oft-used vehicle for merriment and mayhem (okay, I am being droll here).  What sets this film apart is a non-sacchrine performance by James Caan as a ""song and dance man"" who left Sally Field too early.  Some of the jokes are a little lame, but the principals do a great job and of course, we have the fantastic Robert Mulligan directing.  Also, Claire Trevor does a wonderful turn as Sally's character's mother. Last, the home in the film is so great - when can I move in??

This is a great film for lifting you from your troubles and leaving you smiling.  I am so glad it re-appeared in my consciousness - and that Amazon was there waiting with a copy for me!",1323302400,,1293,4.262295081967213
1194847,5,B000006GDX,"This is one of the most underrated movies of all time. It's genuinely funny, very romantic, with very imaginative and original writing, perfect casting and great acting. This film, centering on a young widow,(Sally Field), who is suddenly haunted by her late husband former Broadway choreographer,(James Caan), on the eve of her wedding to uptight Egyptologist, (Jeff Bridges), has everything I look for in a romantic comedy. It's one of my favorite films of all time. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes rom coms or just coms.

1194848,5,B000006GDX,"We had seen Kiss Me Goodbye before my own husband left for that other wonderful place called Heaven.  We both loved the film.  I remembered laughing at Jeff Bridges so hard in this movie.  Seriously, he is amazing in the film, as is everyone actually.  After hearing Bridges in an interview on TV recently, and he made a comment about this film, I quickly pulled Kiss Me Goodbye out again and watched it.  It is so wonderfully funny - hysterically funny - and a must see.

You really need to see it with someone because it needs to be enjoyed with someone you love.

I watched it twice the same night and ordered a copy for our son and his wife.  Just know it is worth owning and you will never grow tired of the story.  Everything, by the way, is as modern today as it was when it first came out for viewing.  No cars are used and nothing is dated.  Hair, clothing, everything is current.  Difficult to do that in any film but this takes no adjustment in years to watch it - not dated at all.  It should be a classic.

Buy it and enjoy it; it is not costly and will last forever.",1314057600,4,1080,4.154589371980676
1194849,4,B000006GDX,"Awesome movie and it's hilarious. I gave it four stars because I'm Not very fond of all the cursing but it's not that much. All- Star crew are funny together, and it really is a good movie.",1288051200,,189,4.135135135135135
1194850,5,B000006GDX,"Kiss Me Goodbye is one of my all-time favorite films. It's a silly little romance with a light ghost-story twist and it will hold your interest from beginning to end. The actors are amazing, and it is their talents that make Kiss Me Goodbye the winner that it is. I've watched it several times, and never tire of it. Sally Field is a particular favorite of mine, and she is outstanding in this film. Jeff Bridges is a museum geek whose romance with Sally is challenged by her late husband's tap-dancing (and hilarious) ghost. Of course, only Sally can see her late husband, so naturally, she seems to be insane.

To me, Kiss Me Goodbye is sheer perfection, and not to be missed.",1286409600,,678,4.512195121951219

I always saw it in parts and I LOVED it.  It's very endearing, sweet and funny and James Caan and Sally Field really were at the top of their game when they made this film.  It's a rare part for Caan to play and he pulled it off without a hitch.  Jeff Bridges also pulled off his part perfectly.  I can't say enough about this film.  Buy it.

1194854,1,B000006GDX,"Despite the presence of an ""all-star"" cast, this film was flat.  Advertised as a romantic comedy, it was difficult to find either. There simply was no chemistry.  While the premise was interesting, it never panned out.  The most enjoyable aspects of the film were the set (loved the house) and a scene between the dog and a former priest.  That's not saying a lot!",1235692800,3,364,4.640625
1194855,5,B000006GDX,I love this movie.  It's one I've thought of many times over the years but the memory was beginning to fade.

It's really cute & Sally Field is at her neurotic best.,1234569600,,325,4.278688524590164

1194899,4,B000006GDX,"If you're looking for a light-hearted, funny but touching comedy to pass the time one evening, this is the one for you!  Sally Field was great, she's a good comedic actress.  James Caan was good- but not great.  He makes Jolly a likable dead guy!  And I thought Jeff Bridges was great!  Yes, his character is kind of wooden, but I always thought that was a great way to play it- especially against the popular, talented, life-of-the-party character Jolly.
The supporting cast was wonderfully funny-especially Kay's father...but you have to pay attention when he's in a scene or you'll miss much of his humor- it's subtle!

1194900,4,B000006GDX,"This film is hardly a comedic masterpiece, however, it proved a very fine vehicle for all three principals, especially Sally Field who, in my opinion, delivers a quirky and hopelessly likeable performance as the woman torn between the ghost of her charming, albeit, womanizing and egotistical dead husband and the bland, academic all around drip of a fianc, James Caan and Jeff Bridges, respectively.  There's none of that hammy grandstanding that has marred her performance in her later work, such as that overwrought cemetery scene in Steel Magnolias.  Here she seems to be not only comfortable in the character's skin and predicament but appears to really be enjoying herself in the process, as does everyone else.  The film has this unpretentious vibe that works totally in its favor and everyone seems to be relaxed and in the mood to deliver the goods.  There are some extremely funny set pieces in this film and I've always considered it a much underrated little charmer, despite some silly scenes and less than inspired ideas.",1178150400,3,1034,5.029239766081871
1194901,3,B000006GDX,"While this one was not great, it was enjoyable for a first viewing. It is the story of a widow who is planning on remarrying. The widow is played by sally field and her beaux is played by Jeff Bridges. They seem to love each other and are prepared for a new life together when an outside force intervenes. That outside force is the ghost of the first husband, played by James Caan.

The deceased hubby was a very successful and prominent figure on Broadway. He has many friends and was always the life of the party. The new guy is more of a stick in the mud and has a hard time living up to expectations. Things are made much worse when the jealous ghost gets involved. Having the widow be the only one who can see or hear him just makes everyone feel crazy.

It turns out that the ghost has a hidden agenda that involves TRUE LOVE.

Its an amusing story, not great but not to shabby either.",1176249600,,891,4.1988304093567255
1194902,5,B000006GDX,I love to see Sally Field in comedies and drama. This movie has them both. The main character seems to have one foot in the past and the other in the future. She can't seem to make up her mind which one she wants to stay in touch with! It is a cute movie and will live up to your expectations of a good romantic comedy!,1172966400,,319,3.8484848484848486
1194903,2,B000006GDX,"This could have been a wonderful comedic farce, with repartee similar to that found in classics such as Bringing Up Baby. However, it's like two movies. The first 45 minutes or hour are long and boring, repeating issues (over and over again) between characters who aren't at all likable and who make you wonder why you're supposed to care about them. Ironically, I found myself caring very much about the character played by Jeff Bridges, who inexplicably is made out to be a monster by everyone else.

Finally the film picks up. When it does, it's very funny in spots. However, one is still left wondering why the heck Bridges would want to marry the character of Sally Fields, whose stupidity and flightiness are overshadowed only by the self-centeredness of James Caan, who plays her two-timing (dead) husband. If you have time to waste, rent it, with a ready finger for the fast-forward button. Otherwise, there are many films that are a better choice. To see ghosts in a genuinely humorous and heart-warming flick, see Heart & Soul. In a similar vein, I'd also recommend Chances Are.",1171843200,5,1088,4.818181818181818

1194946,5,B000006GDX,"Are you a hopeless romantic?  Love romantic comedies?  Love Sally Field and James Caan?  If you answered yes to any, buy this dvd!

This is absolute feel good romantic comedy!  James Caan is wonderful as ""Jolly"", the dead (ghost) husband of ""Kaye"" (Sally Field), who yes, we really love you Sally!  Only she can see him when she moves back into the house that they lived in when he tragically fell down the steps during a party and died.  Upon moving back in, he starts reappearing to her, and of course she thinks she nuts and boy, she really acts this part out perfectly!  Her new fiancee, 'Rupert"" played by a very young Jeff Bridges, is less than thrilled of hearing her talk out loud to her dead husband whom he can't see.  She then says she still loves Jolly and can't decide if she wants to live in the house with him or marry her fiancee.

I don't want to spoil the whole movie for you, but you get the idea.  It has a wonderful feel good ending and ends happily ever after with Jolly saying, ""Kiss Me Goodbye"".  Tears and joy at the same time.

I've been waiting forever for this to be released on dvd, it's rarely played on any cable channels, which is beyond me, because it's a wonderfully enjoyable movie for the whole family!",1141171200,18,1238,4.353711790393013

This movie sticks it to the new guy in every possible way, including portraying him as a stiff, dull nerd.  What a neat revenge!

1194952,3,B000006GDX,"This is a delightful, little known, romantic comedy. It focuses on the prospective second marriage of Kay Villano (Sally Field), who three years prior had become a widow, when her then husband, Jolly (James Caan), met with an accidental death. Her fiance, Rupert Baines (Jeff Bridges), is a quiet, academic sort of man, the antithesis of her dead husband, who was a flamboyant philanderer and well known Broadway choreographer.
When Kay decides to reopen their old home and have the wedding there, she gets an unepected visitor, the ghost of her long dead husband. Unfortunately, only she can see or hear him. She now has to choose whether to linger over the memories of the dead or embrace the idea of creating new memories with the living.
Sally Fields is absolutely delightful as the tormented Kay. Her comedic timing is great, whether as the comedienne or as the comedic foil for James Caan. James Caan takes to the role of Jolly with unsurprising ease. Jeff Bridges is, unfortunately, somewhat wooden and stiff in his role. He could have been better. The rest of the supporting cast, which includes Claire Bloom and Mildred Natwick, however, is excellent.
This film, which brings to mind the likes of Noel Coward, is a funny, well acted film. It is a light, frothy, romantic comedy and has no pretensions of being anything more. It also features a song sung by the late, great Dusty Springfield as an added treat.",1031443200,17,1418,4.815573770491803

7904454,5,B000006GDX,"Adapted from Bruno Bareto's Brazilian comedy ""Dona Flor and her Two Husbands"", Robert Mulligan's film is a delightful homage to the screwball comedies of yore directed by Howard Hawks and George Cukor.  The premise is an absolute delight.  Three years widowed Kay (Sally Field) moves back to the Manhattan townhouse she previously occupied with her late hoofer husband, Jolly (James Caan).  Days before her wedding to the milquetoast archeologist Rupert (Jeff Bridges) the ghost of Jolly reappears in Kay's flat.  The natural mayhem and hilarity ensue.  How can you not like this movie?  Field hits all the right buttons in the Katherine Hepburn role.  Caan does a Gene Kelly like turn as the wily lothario Jolly.  Playing against type Bridges channels Jimmy Stewart as the flustered Rupert.  Add to the mix a wonderful Claire Trevor as Kay's mother who kind of reminded me of Agnes Moorhead on the old ""Bewitched"" TV series.  One of the great character actors of the day, Paul Dooley is on hand as a colleague of Rupert's who used to be a priest.  That aspect plays a key role in the story later in the film.  Mildred Natwick, who was once part of John Ford's repertory, plays the proprietor of a Connecticut bed and breakfast who probably should have thrown Kay and Rupert out on their kiesters for disrupting her fine establishment.  This one didn't get much play on initial release in the early Eighties so it's a fine time to discover it.",1514678400,,1443,4.793522267206478
