6357909,5,B00JHH2096,"Continuing the Shout Factory tradition this will have the first half of this season. This is yet another season with an odd number of episodes (43 total) so I don't know exactly where it cuts off though I'd assume it's the first 21-22 episodes.

As a long-time Power Rangers fan, I've seen nearly every season of this show and I have to say if you are unfamiliar with this one, this may be the greatest season to purchase out of all of them. Most fans say this is the greatest one: action, story, in every aspect this arguably is the best season. I very much recommend it.",1401408000,9,572,4.345794392523365

8650847,5,B00JHH2096,"""Power Rangers: In Space, Vol. 1"" begins where ""Power Rangers: Turbo"" left off, with the defeated Rangers traveling into space to rescue Zordon. As they travel, the villains from the previous five seasons (Rita Repulsa, Lord Zedd, King Mondo and his family, and Divatox) all gather to celebrate Dark Specter's capture of Zordon. (In a great reference, Divatox tells Specter that he looks like her fiancee, since the same animatronic figure was used for both.) The Red Space Ranger spies on the party and Specter sends Astronema after him. The Red Space Ranger meets the Earth Rangers and they team up.
This season was the most ambitious yet, with extended scenes in space requiring green screen work. The interior of the Astro Megaship closely resembles the aesthetic of Star Trek, with a functional, high-tech design. The Rangers' even get uniforms to wear when they're not morphed, which look like the Star Trek uniforms from the late 1990s. Finally, the ship even has a SimuDeck, analogous to the Star Trek holodeck. Andromeda's minions, called Quantrons, closely resemble the Cylons from ""Battlestar Galactica"" while their Velocifighters look like the Cylons' ships. The season features an overarching narrative with the Rangers searching for Zordon, but they alternate between different planets and Earth fighting various monsters and gathering clues to Zordon's location. Perhaps most daring, the new villain, Astronema, is more complex than those before her, with an air of mystery and even romance when she meets the Silver Ranger.
As this season was intended to serve as the series finale, it includes callbacks to several previous characters. The Phantom Ranger returns from ""Power Rangers: Turbo"" and seeks the Space Rangers' help. ""True Blue to the Rescue"" brings back Justin, the Blue Turbo Ranger, along with Storm Blaster, the sentient car he occasionally drove. Other standout episodes in this volume include ""The Craterite Invasion,"" which closely resembles ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" and the Silver Ranger episodes.
This season also includes possibly the most 1990s thing ever: a Power Rangers/Ninja Turtles cross-over. The episodes ""Save Our Ship"" and ""Shell Shocked"" include the Ninja Turtles as they then appeared on Saban's other show, ""Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation."" While the show did not last more than one season, I enjoyed seeing more animatronic turtles like those in the 1990s films when I was a kid. My only complaint about this DVD set is the inclusion of the last time/next time on Power Rangers segments. While they're fun and add a nice touch of nostalgia, they aren't really needed since all the episodes are on the discs.",1505347200,,2668,5.192575406032483
