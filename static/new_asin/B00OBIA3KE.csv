6732826,5,B00OBIA3KE,"I'm a big Scott Foley fan and went into this hoping that I'd like it. Who wants your favorite star to put out a movie you really hate? Anyway, I have to say that I really enjoyed it. It's definitely not for everyone. I couldn't have watched it with my grandmother.

I loved it so much more the 2nd time because there are so many subtle comments and facial expressions that I missed the first viewing. There are so many moments where you think, ""Did they just say/do that?!?"" and the answer is yes. They did. And it was freaking hilarious.

The cast was great and included many of Scott Foley's friends and family. Patrick Wilson stole the show with his expressions and ability to spit out an unexpected line with the straightest of faces. His wife, Dagmara Domiczyk, was amazing as Ward's wife, Stacy. Outrageously funny in her portrayal of the bitchy wife.

The characters are so unlikable that you can't help but like them, or at least love that you hate them. It even has a happy ending. What more can you want?

This is a movie worth buying, so you can watch it as many times as you want to.",1419638400,17,1095,4.379310344827586

Great movie until they get to the movie's topic. I loved the crap outta this movie (and I can be snobby) for it! s realism and other great properties. But once the ""act"" occurs, it went downhill from there. I'm still a fan!",1486166400,,249,4.555555555555555
6732829,2,B00OBIA3KE,Great cast but after 50% through the movie was still a bit flat. I was expecting more of a comedy due to the trailer. The cast does a very good job but I think the screen play lets down an interesting plot.,1486166400,,206,3.9285714285714284

6732831,3,B00OBIA3KE,"Listen. Ward's wife was a total beeyotch. I wanted to kill her in the first 5 minutes. Campy, dark comedy. The actors are all friends or married in real life and produced the low budget film. Worth a watch but don't expect much.",1485907200,,228,4.325581395348837

6732968,2,B00OBIA3KE,Can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or drama.  Not any moments to laugh at; also very hard to believe the entire gang goes along with this plan without much thought.

6732974,1,B00OBIA3KE,"Thought the premise of the film would lead to a light enjoyable comedy.  Total waste of time.  The acting (by relatively unknowns) was stilted and the plot soooo contrived that about mid-way through it became embarrassing to sit and watch, even I was alone.  The actors had no chemistry that I could see.  The scenes with the cop (Ward's neighbour) were so strained in their attempt to be comedic, especially the scene when they are getting ready to dispatch the pieces (Watch and you'll understand what I mean) that I could not watch any more of this film. There are many fairly good, really dumb movies (sounds oxymoronic, I know, but it's not) out there that one can watch and enjoy.  This is not one of them.  I've seen high school ""tit'n'zits"" comedies that were better thought out than this film.",1472774400,,802,4.652482269503546

6733034,2,B00OBIA3KE,"Poor writing. A lot of the plot made little sense because the characters did not seem to react to events and each other how you'd expect them to.  Granted, most of the plot is sound, and I enjoy thinking about murder as much as any sane person does.  That said, it was hard to believe the scenes leading up to the death the movie is about.

Terrible acting.  Most of the characters are two-dimensional.  Few characters have any depth.  Very little background is given on anyone in the movie.  We aren't led to believe anyone's right or wrong.  Perhaps that was the point of the movie?

Little humor.  I found some funny moments in the film, but I honestly could not recognize anything worth calling comedy.  I'm not sure why this movie was in the comedy movies section at all.

No closure.  This is something I can't explain without spoilers, so don't read any further if you haven't seen the movie and plan to watch it.  The movie abruptly ends after the neighbor collaborates on the story of Ward's wife being missing.  That may seem okay to you, but I felt that it made the entire movie kind of pointless to watch.  There wasn't any telling what was going to happen after that.  Ward just looks at his kid and smiles... like it's a good thing for his son that his wife is dead, I guess?  Does the body ever get found?  Are we supposed to have some form of relief when the cop doesn't find out?  Does the guy who had a mental breakdown ever turn everyone in?

Favorite scene has to be the fireplace scene.  LOL!  Dagmara Dominczyk (The Count of Monte Cristo) was awesome as Wards wife.  Some reviewer wrote that she went too far and all she needed was pink hair rollers and a frying pan.  I say the chick with the rollers and frying pan needs to sit down and take notes from Dagmara.

The acting is lukewarm, and a casting mix of what is B- minus celebrities paired with actors liklely to be cast in late night soft core adult film on HBO. The plot is both hilarious and absurd at the same time. Unfortunately, once you buy in to what's happening, you're in for the the dime and therefor the dollar. I think for a lot of people, parallels can be drawn between themselves, and the characters, whether they care to admit it or not. There was one, and only one, interesting twist late in the film, which could be considered an emotional arc, where the shallow and chauvinistic character crosses an actual emotional threshold when pushed by friends to do something he doesn't want to do. Essentially, these characters are ""bros,"" and bros come through for each other no matter what the situation. In this case, the theory is tested, and the macho bro proves to have a totally un-macho moment. In any case, if there's absolutely nothing else to watch, and this is it, you might want to take up a new hobby, like reading.",1446076800,,1076,4.551546391752577

6733307,3,B00OBIA3KE,"From the reviews that I read on Amazon, I expected Let's Kill Ward's Wife to be a disturbingly dark comedy in the tradition of Very Bad Things (1998). It's not. Although the comedy can get dark, I was left wondering how many opportunities were squandered for the sake of neatly ending the movie.

There are moments of real comedy, but the laughs are spaced fairly far apart. The first half hour is especially funny if you are a new parent. Once the deed is done, the comedic elements of the story get truly sparse. There is fun to be had, but it shows up on the local train.

Being a big fan of Donald Faison from his time on Scrubs, I wanted to like this movie so much more than I did, . His talents are frequently wasted in this relatively straight role. The rest of the cast is solid but I never felt myself rooting for them as things begin to get interesting.

I enjoyed this movie but in the end, I felt it was never laugh-out-loud funny. There were too few laughs and the story seemed to just stop short to accommodate the happiest possible ending.",1445385600,2,1054,4.313131313131313

6733476,5,B00OBIA3KE,"One reviewer wrote it's difficult to explain black comedy. Well, has that reviewer or any other viewer considered the irony underlying  the story's series of events from which rises its humor?  Comedy of this movie is rooted in the irony of the predicament and how the characters respond to that predicament. Hilarious moments occur many times in this movie.

Directed by Scott Foley is better known for his acting in TV shows, The Unit and Scandal. Lets Kill Wards Wife comically portrays how a group of four friends, suburban professionals, conspire to get away with murder. The event of the killing itself is incidental, not premeditated. Or is it?

A premise such as this is the set-up in which the comedic action takes place. Besides this movie being a comedy, it is also a buddy movie. Through the situation brought on by the murder of Amanda, Wards wife, the story demonstrates an examination of how this specific murder affects the relationships between the four guys. How the situation of the murder is set up makes it so even wives of two characters, Tom and David, become quickly involved. Even the wives are neither horrified by what has transpired nor unwilling to participate in events connected to the murder's cover-up.

 As a group there is very little remorse demonstrated by anyone. Instead the groups behavior would be better fitting in the event of their killing, feather plucking, and then carving up a fresh chicken. Its the groups displayed nonchalance in this ghastly situation that makes this film humorous.

As said, shocking series of appalling events connected with the murder and its cover-up fail to elicit any semblance of horror in or among the characters except in one character, Ronnie. His sense of remorse occurs in sharp contrast to each character's matter of fact sense of banality about the murder.

That demonstrated effect of banality in the outrageous context of the murder and its cover-up is at the root of what makes this film a comedy. Perhaps that is the intent of the screenwriter, to dramatize another aspect of the banality of evil. Such banality ironically invites the viewer to identify with the characters.",1441324800,,2160,4.947513812154696

6733722,4,B00OBIA3KE,"I found this movie amusing because most people might know folks who mildly resemble the characters.  The movie is about a group of friends who don't like Ward's wife because she is totally overbearing and full of herself.  So, the group of friends discuss amongst themselves about doing something to help ease Ward's oppression and the discussion eventually leads towards the thought of killing his wife.  Well, the situation presents itself and a friend actually does the unthinkable - he kills her!!  She just talked a little too much at the wrong time!!

Now there is the issue of disposal while Ward's neighbor, who is a cop, is close on their heels as they try to conceal the dirty deed.  In conclusion, I didn't give this movie five stars because it didn't end realistically.  I won't give away the ending but I was let down because the conclusion was lacking realism.

Off to a slow start I thought this movie would be boring and hard to follow. Boy was I wrong. There was a solid theme that ran through the movie, very coherent. The characters were sparse but very well placed and everyone did an outstanding job at making their roles come through with great performances. As the title says, its about one of the characters awful wife and a jokingly plan to kill her over a few drinks, oddly enough the opportunity presented itself and one thing led to another. Afterwards the suspense and funny moments began, I was on the edge of my seat more than once with both laughter and suspense  just knowing everything was going to be found out. The ending was great and everything fell into place nicely. If you want to laugh-out-loud and cringe a time or two this is the movie for you.",1436745600,4,831,4.496688741721854

Working with what must have been an infinitesimal budget, several pairs of very good actors portray husbands and wives caught up in a (for them) cataclysmic event. Perhaps the crew are friends in real life, or maybe they're good enough to produce the illusion of people who've known each other for a long time. If your taste is strictly for movies like Avengers et all (which I love), you won't have much patience for this film. If you don't mind a slow build and some slapstick thrown in with the story, give it a try.

6733922,5,B00OBIA3KE,"If you're a fan of black comedies like I am, then Let's Kill Ward's Wife will be one of the funniest movies you've seen. While some may feel the acting is a little forced and characters a bit too on-the-nose, especially in the case of the titular wife, it all fits perfectly to create a truly entertaining comedy about broken marriages, golf, and the various ways to dispose of a human body.

The film has a rather talented cast with the likes of Patrick Wilson and Donald Faison playing an out-of-work actor and the hapless husband of the worst wife in the world respectively. Wilson's matter-of-fact way of getting through the grizzly process of disposing of a murdered woman's remains produces many of the laughs, and Faison really makes you feel sorry for this truly broken man whose soul has been stamped into the dirt by his detestable spouse. While the titular wife (whose name and actress elude me) is practically cartoonish in her behavior, you still manage to hate the ever-loving heck out of her and eagerly await the inevitable to finally happen. Toss in the fact that Ward's neighbor is a cop, played by the always lovable Greg Grunberg, and you have a pretty intense and hilarious film with plenty of laughs.",1435968000,,1222,4.710280373831775
6733923,4,B00OBIA3KE,I had doubts before watching.  I enjoyed the show very much. Good laughs and everyone knows the feeling of that one friends spouse that is just over the top bitchy. Very relatable,1435968000,,179,4.59375
6733924,3,B00OBIA3KE,"I couldn't believe it!  Who would want to kill their friend's wife? Ward apparently didn't mind that much.  He's still with her.  His friends were funny.  Even though they had a kid, Ward should just leave her and try to get custody of Ramone.  Thinking of killing her because she's a HUGE  B****, is not an option!  The acting was good.

Besides a wonderful and bizarre story which I loved and is among my favorite movies now, we have the amazing direction of Scott Foley. The cast is to me, anyway a dream cast Scott Foley, Patrick Wilson, James Carpinello (sensational), Donald Faison, Amy Acker and Dagmara, Marika, Veronika Domincyk. Easch performer brings something unique and refreshing....real talent. 10 thumbs up for this wonderful little masterpiece. Thank you Scott, Patrick, James Etc.

6733964,1,B00OBIA3KE,"It's pretty clear that when Ward dipped his wick, you truly committed a mahor blunder.  He was roped into marrying a very abusive woman, and it's clear that her death would be a blessing for Ward - all his friends agree.  One of them, in fact, even suggests that they figure out how to kill her.  Was he kidding?  He says so, unconvincingly.

But they don't murder her, exactly.  When she abuses one of Ward's friends, he erupts into action, shoving her face into food - but when she extricates herself, she falls, and apparently the crack on her skull kills her.

Afraid that the friend will be convicted of manslaughter, the friends try to figure out how to make her disappear and never be found, and THAT is the gist of the movie.  It works well as an ""elevator pitch"" for making the movie, I suppose, but this isn't the first recent ""OMG, how do we deal with a corpse"" movie; in fact, the most notorious even had a sequel.  And it's not like the gag is running thin on this third movie; it ran out of gas halfway through the first one.

There's a place for this kind of movie.  At the drive-in ""passion pit"" theatre, nobody much watches the movie much anyhow.  But usually, those movies have a lot of nearly-nekkid bodies to put sexy thoughts in young heads, and a chainsaw-wielding villain so she can jump upon his lap and demand to be held tightly, and she can pretend she's afraid and not admit she wants to be well and thoroughly, uh, ""romanced.""  The games we play, all because we pretend that ""decent"" young women don't have human urges!

Lacking those stereotypical drive-in scenes, it becomes difficult to figure out who should see this movie.  The  actors and the director seem to not be at fault - but the screenwriters deserve a bonis for this movie, not because the script is so great, but because it's amazing they did this well, considering the constraints.  The Geneva Conventions should prohibit abusing writers this way.

I guess you could show the movie for a party, provided that you spike the punch heavily, and turn down the lights so nobody notices clothing being removed.  Or you could leave it on so the dog doesn't get bored while you're hone.  Gathing the familt gogether with lots of popcorn and Pepsi, though, would be a bad idea.",1435276800,2,2262,4.524630541871921

6734132,2,B00OBIA3KE,"My newest adventure into Hollywood has me watching Let's Kill Ward's Wife. Going in, I've heard that this is a quote ""black comedy"", but honestly... there isn't anything that this movie has in common with any black comedy that I've ever seen. The movie's plot involves a group of close friends with Ward, a new father who has quite possibly the worst wife in any movie that I've ever seen. She makes jokes about rolling ontop of her baby and makes it a point to be miserable and angry, especially at her husband Ward. I wish I were kidding, but even the wives of the friends say the same things as their husbands.

As Ward's wife is finally murdered, it becomes an involving plot in disposing of the body. This is pretty much the WHOLE plot, from the murder which happens not so long into the movie. So it really isn't that long of a film, thank goodness! But even from the start, looking at the description, I knew it wasn't going to be great. But I DID think it was going to be interesting to watch. I was not disappointed in this, but there are infinitely better movies out there.

6734445,5,B00OBIA3KE,"Dark comedy at its finest - but word of warning, if you do not have a dark sense of humor, you will not like this. What I really enjoyed about it was that Ward's wife is actually Patrick Wilson's wife in real life... Also, Patrick Wilson's wife in the movie is Scott Foley's wife in real life. Now that you're completely confused, on to the rest of the review.

At first I was thinking, what in the heck am I watching? But just stick with it - I am in no way condoning what the characters did, but it was entertaining (I do have a different type of sense of humor) I am a huge fan of Patrick Wilson and his character was hilarious. This is also not a movie for kids. Don't watch around them.

Five stars for a different plot and a dark subject matter turned into something that we know isn't usually customary. For an independent, low budget film, these guys did a great job helping me escape real life for a little while.",1432598400,4,922,4.203389830508475

A situational comedy revolving around death usually has that death be an accident. It may be planned, it may be intended, but it is always an accident.

This movie broke that rule, and the movie suffered for it. With a slight change this could have been a great movie. A funnier and more entertaining movie. As it was it came off a poor cross between a situational comedy and a dark comedy.

6734577,5,B00OBIA3KE,"This was something I got in the mail today on my netflix disc plan. As soon as I saw the trailer a few weeks ago I immediately put it at the top of my que. It's pretty predictable but that's ok. I don't need every movie to be a theatrical masterpiece to enjoy it. If your a movie lover, you understand. I'm a sci-fi man and have been even before it was popular to be, but dark comedies are a guilty pleasure from way back in the day!

Depending on your sense of humor, this movie could hit you a lot of different ways from finding it to be repulsive, to peeing on yourself. I've never understood rating movies like this with a low rating. Anyone who saw the trailer knew what they were getting into. I thought it was enjoyable. I don't think I've ever seen Patrick Wilson in anything I didn't like. This movie was cast extremely well. It's also paced extremely well. It didn't need to be over 80 minutes and it wasn't. I have more respect for this. I can't tell you how many times I've say in the theater in pain and commented on the way out to my wife ""would have been a lot better as a 90 minute or less film instead of stretching it out to 1:50+ so kudos. These days with most things shot with video and not film, I think they just shoot everything to death and sort it out in editing and it's still a mile long. This was quick and dirty. And it was, DIRTY. On so many levels. This one is best for mature audiences. Can't tell you how many times my wife and I go see a late at night rated R movie and people drag their little kids in there. It happens a lot. I can't imagine how they justify it, but please, not this one. With that said, it was more tasteful than it could have been and I'm really thankfull it wasn't too much gore to it. I think they realized that just because you like a dark comedy, doesn't  make you a horror fan. But yeah I really enjoyed it as a rental and I'm gonna pick it up on bluray. I'm hoping it has a commentary and/or other special features cause if not I'll hold out for a cheaper copy.

If you enjoy this, another movie you might want to check out is Kevin Smith's new TUSK. Quite a bit more to that one including and that bluray does indeed have quite a bit of special features.

I don't want to imply this is a must buy movie. For most it is not. I would say this is a great rental for Patrick Wilson fans and/or fans of dark comedy.",1425340800,2,2372,4.051172707889126

It won't be a waste of time to rent or go see in theaters if released. The online quality is also excellent. I see bigger things for the actor Patrick Wilson too that he'll become a household name. He had a great movie called Stretch which was also very funny and had Chris Pine in it too. These folks all did a great job in front of the camera and behind the scenes as some of them pulled double duty as producers and the director, Scott Foley, even had a bit part.
