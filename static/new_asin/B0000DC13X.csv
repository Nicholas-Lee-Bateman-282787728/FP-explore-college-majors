8000673,5,B0000DC13X,"Okay, I loved the plot, first of all. It was pretty good, but I think that the whole thing is so old. Some regular boring kid-mechanic, rises up into fame.

Isn't that so old? The good parts are that the music is absolutely terrific in the beginning and the end and I didn't get tired of listening to it 6 times during the whole episode.

The whole thing keeps you on the edge of your seat, and from the beginning you can tell that everything isn't what it seems.

Lean (how do you spell it), is a bit weird and his relationship with the girl is a bit weird and the fact that they both don't even have bullets in their guns makes them seem like idiots, but it was still good overall.

However, the nude part is totally unneccessary. We get the point when she lands in a totally different world, but does the girl have to be naked? Also, all of that suffering is unneccessary as well. I almost spilled my dinner all over my new tiles.

Overall, it's a pretty nice movie and I would recommend it to anyone who has a strong stomach and loves manga.",1154822400,2,1045,4.205
8000674,4,B0000DC13X,Buy this if your into action and adventure. This has good scifi stuff. This is out of this world.,1142121600,,97,4.157894736842105
8000675,2,B0000DC13X,"You wish! Seriously though, I went into this one with high hopes, and it left me feeling VERY disappointed. With the character designer of Macross and a universe that combines a girl with mystical powers, giant robots, and warring nations, you'd think it would be a recipe for a winner...

First, the good points: The character designs and animation are indeed quite good, and the main characters are likable enough (though not so likable that I remember their names). The soundtrack isn't half bad, and the voice-acting is passable.

Now the bad: The whole thing feel incredibly rushed, a lot of time is spent on characters who are repulsive (perverse, deranged, and just plain wacko), there is more robot action in the opening credits than in every episode except the first and the last, the plot revelations happen so fast at the end that they make the storyline borderline rediculous (I know this a sequel but COME ON!), there is little backhistory given on the characters that we DO like, the action scenes are more gruesome than awesome (all the people dying when a city gets nuked in particular left me ready to lose my lunch), and the plot, characters, and dialog just don't really draw you in.

If you want to see the mythical and the scientific combined (and the giant robot as well!), I reccomend checking out Escaflowne. If you love the character designs of Macross, you might want to consider Gunbuster. But I would only reccomend RENTING this one if you liked the first Orguss. No better than mediocre.",1093910400,2,1516,4.778625954198473
8000676,5,B0000DC13X,"This is a real good series, if you like Crest of the Stars, Heavy Metal L-Gaim, or any Leiji Matsumoto based series you will enjoy this. The animation is top notch the action is great the story is great, the characters are interesting. I wish the original Orguss was out on R1 dvd so I could see more of this world known as Orguss. It really got me thinking of Heavy Metal L-Gaim while I was watching this, it just has a similar feeling to it. Get this DVD it is actually a bargain at this price as it contains the entire 6 episode OVA.",1082160000,5,536,4.114285714285714
8000677,5,B0000DC13X,"180 Minutes, all 6 episodes, Remastered 5.1 English with stereo English (not listed on cover) and Stereo Japanese. (note to Amazon.com: please update your information on this title)
This is a mecha series with a strong storyline and nice classic anime style.  The mecha designs are limited in appeal but the characters and storyline more than make up for it.
I won't tell you the storyline except it revolves around war and spying at least in the first 4 episodes, episode 4 starts to reveal another underlying story line, but You will have to buy the DVD or read the VHS reviews to find out.  After all why buy something is you already know how it all unfolds :-)",1068508800,5,664,4.571428571428571
