1712456,5,B00006676E,"Brian Hooks is truly the king of the dvd. Don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy the movie as much as I did. This is pretty much a sequel from the movie Q with the same theme. His parents leave and he throws a party which all but destroys his parent's house. Sorry, it's not a party, it's a lua.",1297641600,,303,3.903225806451613
1712457,5,B00006676E,"This is a very good movie. I can't stop watching this movie. Let's be honest, this movie isn't going to win an academy award for best picture, so take it for what it is. I'll admit that the humor is a little over the top, such as Delron getting violated by his transexual girlfriend. However that is what makes this movie humorous. Brian Hooks performance is hilarious as usual. Everybody give this movie a chance you just might like it.",1133049600,,437,4.475
1712458,5,B00006676E,I couldn't stop laughing at this movie. Every time I tried to something happened to him that just made me start laughing agian. I recommend that you watch this movie when you want that special someone in your life to have a good time with you before they really have a good time.,1098403200,,279,4.283018867924528
1712459,5,B00006676E,"Brian Hooks is fast becoming a comedy ""star"" in his own right, able to favorably compare to Chris Tucker and Mike Epps without fear of being overshadowed. If you liked ""Friday"" and ""Third Strike"", then you'll DEFINITELY dig this one; it's just as funny!!
 I think I may have to rank this movie above ""Third Strike"" for gut-busting humor. There's also a hilarious performance turned in by Faizon Love (""Big Worm"" of ""Friday"" fame), and plenty sex-appeal from Maia Campbell (""In The House"" TV show). This movie should garner underground popularity much the same way ""Friday"" did when it hit DVD: you recognize most all the characters in the film from your personal lives.
On the other hand, a movie such as this will obviously have a small budget, depending on the writing, characters and situations for entertainment value. Take it for what it is- don't expect the moon, and you won't be dissapointed. The only other caveat, for some, might be the two ""in-your-face"", sex-oriented  scenes/jokes. Other than that, it's the usual ""R-rated"" ingredients: cursing, nudity, & violence -enjoy!",1033948800,2,1085,5.022222222222222
1712460,2,B00006676E,"This movie was not entertaining.  It was baffoonish with way over the top comedy.  Many of the scenarios were taken from his movie ""Q.""  Some parts were funny, but overall it could have been better.  I like the fatal attraction bit.  The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because I like the fact that Brian Hooks is doing his thing with independent films.  This review is not to down the movie, but to give constructive criticism.  I am a fan of Maia Campbell...",1026777600,,465,4.337209302325581
