2438050,1,B000BQYWZW,How can you give a review to something you haven't even looked at yet? So let's balance out this review rating...,1131494400,3,113,4.428571428571429
2438051,1,B000BQYWZW,"I GAVE THIS 1 STAR ONLY TO BALANCE OUT WHAT YOU ARE READING.. ITS BAD ENOUGH PEOPLE REVIEW THINGS THAT THEY KNOW THEY DONT LIKE ALREADY, BUT TO REVIEW STUFF AND GIVING IT 5 STARS BASED ON THE BAND OR THEIR LOVE OF A BAND IS REDICULOUS. REVIEWING  PRODUCT BEFORE IT IS EVEN RELEASED IS BS! REVIEWS ARE SUIPPOSED TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE PLANNING TO BUY MAKE A DECISION. AND TO REVIEW PRODUCTS THAT ARENT EVEN RELEASED YET IS DOING EVERYONE A DIS-SERVICE, EXCEPT THE BAND THAT YOU LOVE BLINDLY. JUST BECAUSE A CERTAIN SHOW WAS GOOD DOESNT NECESSARILY MAKE THE DVD GOOD. AND ALSO TO GIVE KISS ANY 5 STAR REVIEW FOR RELEASING THE SAME TIRED SONGS IS A SERIOUS BLOW TO ANYONE WHO MAY WANT TO MAKE AN ACTUAL OPINION BASED ON YOUR REDICULOUS REVIEWS OF HOW YOU EXPECT THE DVD WILL BE... AND I AM A KISS FAN...

NOTE TO AMAZON! : DO NOT ACCEPT REVIEWS FOR A PRODUCT UNTIL IT IS ACTUALLY DOMESTICALLY RELEASED. YOU CANT GO BY BLIND LOVERS LIKE THE AFORMENTIONED REVIEWERS. DO A SERVICE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND AT LEAST MAKE SURE THAT THE REVIEWS ARE SINCERE.",1131494400,9,1044,4.348717948717948
2438052,5,B000BQYWZW,"This will certainly be an excellent DVD.  I was at the Virginia Beach gig and let me tell you, IT WAS THE BEST CONCERT EVER----PERIOD.

The set list on this DVD is: (according to the Kiss official Magazine)

Disc 1 - Intro, Love Gun, Deuce, Makin' Love, The Dressing Room (documentary), Lick It Up, Christine Sixteen, Photo Shoot(documentary), She, Tears Are Falling, Got To Choose, The Meet & Greets(documentary), I Love It Loud, Love Her All I Can, I Want You, Soundchecks(documentary) and Parasite.

This selection of songs is great and its awesome to see Kiss doing a different setlist from the whole 'farewell' thing.

In response to many kiss haters.  Tommy and Eric BELONG in the band.  They are both miles better players and musicans then Ace or Peter ever were.  Just Buy this DVD and you will agree.

This is set to be the coolist Kiss DVD

2438054,5,B000BQYWZW,"I am eagerly awaiting this DVD! I was at the Va Beach Show for the taping of the DVD. They also filmed the Bristow, VA show so the DVD is halphed up between those 2 nights. The Va. Beach show was so Killer! My forst Kiss show was in HAmpton, VA back in Feb 1984 on the Lick it up tour. The power they played with that night and in the Va Beach 2004 concert are very much alike! KISS is back! And you can't do anything about it!!",1130889600,2,428,3.8202247191011236

2438059,5,B000BQYWZW,This is the best DVD set I've ever seen of any Band. Kiss is the best at putting out products for fans to collect. So Many other bands miss the boat and lose money to bootleggers. Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley are rock and roll fans and Gene once wrote a fanzine so he understands the collectors. All good for his business and income security for his family.  Paul can continue his rock star dreams and share all of it with fans...Nothing wrong with making money if you continue to put out quality product such as this DVD. I wish there was one for every tour in Kiss' long history.,1363910400,,582,4.290909090909091

2438064,1,B000BQYWZW,"Let me start by saying I love KISS! There it's out of the way... Now about Rock The Nation Live: This is video attempts to bring all the energy of a live KISS concert to the home viewer by employing multiple ( and I mean MULTIPLE!!) cameras to record every aspect of the concert. What The viewer actually gets is an editor gone wild in the cutting room! There is barely a shot that is longer than 5 seconds long of any band member at any given time, unless you use the feature that follows individual members of the band. Add to the problem the fact that there are more shots of the audience than there are of the band and you get real tired real fast. Skip this DVD, you'll find better shows on YouTube.",1345420800,2,704,4.1838235294117645

2438094,1,B000BQYWZW,"as with most of these reviews i agree with the fact that eric and tommy aren't peter and ace,they don't play with the same emotion and the energy level of a kiss show has went way down from when i first saw them on animalize. gene is just out to make another dollar and it sickens me as a guy who has supported this band since i was about 7 years old,im just glad that the great bruce kullick didn't end up a part of this scam! sadly kiss has died,at least i have the old memories,if you're a true kiss fan avoid this lame show!",1316649600,2,528,3.990566037735849
2438095,5,B000BQYWZW,"Kiss have a lot of DVDs on the market, all of varying quality and taken from all different eras of the band's career. 2005's Rock The Nation DVD is taken from their successful 2004 Rock The Nation Tour which sees the band, now with Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer in the line up (as on their following 'Sonic Boom,' and 'Monster,' studio albums) replacing Peter Criss and Ace Frehly on drums and guitar after a classic-line-up reunion.

The band absolutely deliver in terms of performance, the songs are delivered in an absolutely professional and yet energetic fashion, with a set list that concentrates primarily on rock songs from the 70s as opposed to focusing more on ballads and later material. If you like Kiss mostly for their rock songs from the 70s, then pick up a copy of this DVD right away, but if you only like their 80s output then their are other Kiss DVDs out their which will serve you better.

As a DVD, Rock The Nation is excellent; with fantastic sound and mixing, as well as great camera work and editing (as opposed to the over-edited Symphony DVD) and it is really one of, if not the best looking and sounding DVDs Kiss have released.

Classics like 'Deuce,' 'Shout It Out Loud,' 'Love Gun,' and 'Detroit Rock City,' are all in evidence, as well as a few choices you wouldn't expect like 'Unholy,' and 'War Machine,' both of which are fantastic additions. Of course you get all the pyro, smoke bombs, make up, fake blood, big screens and flying band members that make Kiss so entertaining live and Paul Stanley is very communicative with the crowd, helping the band to come across like they really appreciate being up there on stage.

In terms of extras; There is a multi-angle feature called Kiss Power Vision, where you can choose which band member you want to see, which can interrupt the screen with picture in picture scenarios, but it can be turned off. Also there is a behind the scenes documentary and set of interviews, but rather than be accessible as a complete feature separately, it is inter-cut with the main concert every few songs or so.

If these two special features potentially interrupting a complete concert don't sound like they'd annoy you, if you like Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer in the band and if you like the track listing (They can't play every song you like on every DVD) then get yourself a copy of Rock The Nation, otherwise content yourself with one of the many other Kiss DVDs on the market, such as Kissology Volume 1.",1315699200,5,2474,4.613636363636363
2438096,5,B000BQYWZW,"KISS at their best even without two of the original guys.  Right up there with San Fran 1975(in many ways superior to the S.F. show), Cobo Hall 1976, Anaheim 1976, Tokyo 1977, Sydney 1980, Rio 1983, Germany 1983, Cobo Hall 1985 and Michigan Palace 1990 & 1992.

I'll take this show over Roosevelt Stadium 1976, Madison Square Garden 1977, Houston Summit 1977, Largo 1979, Tiger Stadium 1996 and Vancouver 1999.",1301616000,5,410,4.8428571428571425
2438097,5,B000BQYWZW,"This concert is absolutely incredible!  I saw KISS the first time in 1977 when AC/DC (with Bon Scott) was their back-up band, and I was skeptical about this concert DVD because Peter and Ace weren't there, but I was so blown away by Tommy and Eric!! This concert is worth far more than the price!  I've watched it five times in the last three days!!  It's so refreshing after watching these so-called ""rock stars"" today like Britney Spears and Chris Brown who are nothing but lip-syncing gymnastsl!! KISS are the best MUSICIANS ever!",1301529600,4,533,4.709677419354839
2438098,5,B000BQYWZW,"I too, was kinda...ehhhhh when I found out that Ace & Peter were out and their greasepaint would be worn by replacements.  Well, all I can say is ...TOMMY DA SPACEMAN AND ERIC DA CATBOY RAWK!  This whole vid RAWKS! Gene seemed to really be in top form (gross and disgusting as usual!  You go Gene!)that night...he boogies like a Demon(did I really say that?) on da BASS!  Paul is a SLUT! (hehehe)
Paul maintained his usual, relentless 2nd guitar drive. Vocally, Paul's unmistakable, operatic voice has never been better!  WHEN THE HELL IS THIS (and Symphony) GONNA BE RE-RELEASED ON BLU-RAY??? I want KISS IN BLU-RAY DAMMIT!
If you think that KISS sucks...then YOU suck. You're probably some bitter, uptight prick with a broomstick up your butt.
If you think that Tommy Thayer sucks....you're no KISS fan..you're probably..well..see above.
Tommy haters SUCK!
Use the KISS-Vision feature and check out Eric Singer on some of the songs...He's so animated!! (he's also a muthah on da drumz).
I saw KISS last year on the Sonic Boom tour.  IT RAWKED!  You got 2 guys over 60 (Paul's 60 in January 2011), one 53 (Eric will be 53 this year) and one 50 (Tommy).  As it says on the box..(or is it in the little booklet)...I'll paraphrase...the addition of Tommy Thayer and Eric singer has clearly infused the band with a blistering new level of theatricality and musicality...KISS is truly re-born!
ALL other bands..ALL OF THEM..pale in comparison...Stones? blah...Beatles? blah...Zep?  blah,,phhlltttt. U2?  double-phhllltttt..",1294617600,3,1519,5.04
2438099,2,B000BQYWZW,"The issue with this performance video is not the music. The music sounds fine, the sound quality is good and Tommy Thayer has pretty much mastered being Ace Frehley. That said, this video is appalling. Not even because of the fact that the product on display here is only 1/2 original, but because of the people buying the product.
  This DVD is marred with frequent cuts to the audience, something that is completely unnecessary in the first place (we get it, people like the band) but these cuts reveal something far more disturbing. KISS used to be a dangerous band, they used to stand for something. Here the faces in the crowd are not those of Rock n' Roll rebels, but of those of the absolute antithesis of that. Slutty housewives, small children, and an abundance of KISS logos adorn this crowd. In the first 10 minutes I saw the devil horns flashed INCORRECTLY in 3 different ways. These are not Rock fans, they're not even KISS fans, they're just there to be there. These are the type of people who don't know anything about Kiss except ""I Was Made For Lovin You"", ""Rock and Roll All Nite"", ""Detroit Rock City"", ""Beth"" and, if they're truly knowledgeable, ""Deuce"". What's worse than seeing a 9 year old singing ""Lick It Up""? NOT seeing a 9 year old sing ""Lick It Up"". These people don't even know the song! When Paul announces they're about to play a song from ""Rock and Roll Over"" the audience reacts as if they've never heard of the album (probably becauses it doesn't contain Rock n' Roll All Nite, then again, they probably don't know ""Dressed to Kill"" either.) When he starts to play ""Love Her All I Can"", there is no audible reaction from the audience. This is a rare classic being played, but they have NEVER EVEN HEARD THE SONG BEFORE. It's all about facepaint and explosions to them. It's plain to see that the hardcore KISS fans had checked out by this point, because there isn't one to be found in this video. What can be found here is a document of a band that is no longer what it once was, and may be condemned to playing to drunken, novice and/or too young to understand crowds for the rest of its life as a comical remnant of an era long gone by.",1289347200,5,2171,4.43859649122807
2438100,1,B000BQYWZW,"You know what you're getting with a KISS concert for the past 10 - 12 years...Same old tired songs with one gem added to the set (in this care Lover her all I can). That being said the setlist is not the real casualty here it's the camera work. When did concert film makers start thinking that rock fans wanted to see hand held cams like in Saving private Ryan?? There's something to be said for merely capturing a performance instead of switching camera angles LITERALLY every 3 seconds. I seriously couldn't focus on the screen. It's unwatchable. Plus with all the songs in KISS' library do we really need to hear RnR all nite, Detroit, War machine, Lick it up etc etc.. You always say your here for the fans right?? Well the real fans have been screaming for years to do shows with REAL RARITIES. Much like they did with MTV unplugged. That set was fantastic. A KISS fans dream come true with a world without heroes, Plaster Caster, Rock bottom, Nothing to lose, Comin home etc.. I sold my copy of this.",1286409600,6,1006,4.443243243243243
2438101,5,B000BQYWZW,"Awesome concert. I love that they cover songs from their ravenous 70's era to their 80's hair metal period. Despite this not being Frehley & Criss in their makeup, for better or worse depending on what camp you stand on, Thayer & Singer are more than worthy replacements. I love the enthusiasm & energy they bring to KISS while Paul Stanley still remains one of rock music's most underrated frontmen. ""Rock the Nation"" definitely beats owing several dusty concert bootleg vhs tapes. Long live the gods of thunder!",1283558400,,513,4.840909090909091
2438102,5,B000BQYWZW,"Excellent DVD, concert, price and quality! You can watch each band member seperately through the whole concert, or watch all of them and the whole show! I enjoyed watching Gene Simmons for the whole concert...the guys crazy on stage!",1275782400,,233,5.0
2438103,4,B000BQYWZW,"This DVD captures the Rock the Nation tour shortly after Ace had left the band and Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer had taken on their respective jobs full time. Although I will always prefer the original line up, just because that is what KISS was to me as a kid, Tommy and Eric are far more superior musicians. This particular DVD showcases some KISS Klassics that haven't been played in a long time. Particularily ""Makin' Love"" one of my favorites from the old days.

This was shot on two seperate nights, because I believe they must have had to reshoot some footage because Paul's Voice was shot at one of the venue's.....I have noticed over the last couple years that Paul has started to lose some of his range, and get's hoarse easily. However he is still one of the premier rock and roll front men.

This DVD also has some behind the scene's footage which was nice and also there is an option to focus on one particular band member during certain select songs.......kinda neat.

This is a great addition to your KISS Kollection, but I would rank the KISS symphony DVD a bit higher......better behind the scene stuff, and a full length documentary that was very cool. If Ace would have shown for that particular performance, that DVD would be absolute KISS Double Platinum. It's really a shame that Ace blew it off, and didn't join for such a historic moment in Kisstory.

As far as RTN.........this is a great KISSmas present.......and worth the money.",1227312000,,1455,4.6498054474708175
2438114,4,B000BQYWZW,"First off...I'm  tired of people  calling this ""Scab"" KISS...is it  Paul and Gene's fault that Ace and Peter can't show up and be PROS? Honestly folks..I would love to have Ace and Peter in the lineup but they are very ungrateful for their extreme good fortune and continue to prove they can't deal with success  and refuse to be professional.  Ace is an exciting player but also sloppy as hell and sometimes that's cool and Peter loses the beat often..so the music often suffers with them not really ""there"" for the shows.

But back to this 2 DVD set...its a well recorded event ...well produced ...great production values on the actual show and with a few bonus features as well.  The MULTI ANGLE function which is fun for isolating members of the band...keeps the other angles on screen which isn't my favorite way (distracting) so I'm knocking a star for that and because if Kissology is 5 stars this can't be 5...so I'd say a solid 4 if you are a fan..and have Kissology...if not I'd recommend start your collection there first!",1218758400,2,1033,4.642857142857143
2438115,2,B000BQYWZW,"what a real shame! Filmed in High Deff and mixed in 5.1 audio, but the editing is almost as bad as that Kiss in Las Vegas DVD! You can't watch any angel for more than 4 seconds before they cut to a new angel! It's a joke!
What has gotten into this modern film making where they assume the audience must have ADD! You cant kick back and enjoy a great show, they have to show you all the camera's and do it in every 4 seconds! This is just Crap!
  Get Kissology 3 for good shows with good editing.
One comment on this ""new"" Kiss lineup...
To dress up Thayer and Singer as Peter Criss and Ace Frehely....I don't know.
I'd rather see Ace and Peter and hear/see them perform some of their hits, but it is what it is...Thayer and Singer or top notch guys, Singer does do ""Black Diamond"" and a very good job at it, I wish they let him and Thayer do other Peter and Ace songs, I mean they are wearing their costumes, might as well.",1208304000,3,923,4.065934065934066
2438116,5,B000BQYWZW,"In 2004 Kiss came to the last place on Earth, you know, the south border for the first time.  They came to Laredo and Hidalgo in Texas.  At last my dream came true.  I'm from Laredo and never thought they would come one day.  It was august 12th, I still remember.  No the original line-up, but their music and the way they make concerts is what matters.  Paul Stanley, Gene Simmond, Eric Singer & Tommy Thayer.  When I watch this video I travel to that day.  Just for ""Tears are Falling"", that's the differnce.  They played ""Psycho Circus"" in that concert instead.  But everything else is just the same.",1203984000,,603,4.4495412844036695
2438117,2,B000BQYWZW,"Although the four masked musicians on cover photo looks like the original line up spaceman and cat weren't perfomed by Frehley and Criss. Their characters were played on that tour by other guys. In a first moment seems like a reunion but it's something different. It would be nice to see original line up playing together again. The guys are great together in spite of the personal differences. Maybe it's time to take another way. Wouldn't be cool to see this guys playing some mix of rhythm'n'blues, blues, country rock, jazzy or funkiest style? I think so. Some fans might say NO! It doesn't matter. IMHO Kiss really has lost something in Unmasked years. That was my last perfect Kiss album. An underrated album with great songs in a modern concept. The last great album with Criss or Anton Fig. Eric Carr was a nice guy and a very good drummer for heavy metal style in ""Creatures of The Night"" and following albums. Although his own pace was slightly fast for older songs with a bit of push on the rhythm he was a really nice guy. But I still prefer the cool and funny Criss's style because it's more virtuous. Kiss has turned to heavy metal after Unmasked. Their sound has became a kind of Stanley & Simmons Band. Frehley and Criss songs are still needed in the band. Everyone has your own opinion. This is my opinion.",1189123200,,1323,4.539748953974895
2438118,5,B000BQYWZW,"Lots of great live footage, which is why I wanted it in the first place. This is a truly great KISS live performance and you'll want to watch it again and again to make sure you didn't miss anything!",1187827200,2,199,4.128205128205129
2438119,3,B000BQYWZW,"The only knock against this DVD would be the fact that Ace Frehley is not in the mix. Anyone can do a better job than Peter Criss but Ace is sorely missed at lead guitar. Also where is ""Do you love me""? and ""Black Diamond""?  Otherwise great audio and visual but I would rather have closeups of Ace throwing licks rather than Tommy Thayer.",1183939200,,338,4.28125
2438120,5,B000BQYWZW,"I'm all for the original lineup, folks, but this particular lineup plays the songs very, very well, and the songlist includes much that you won't find anywhere else, or played as well.

I would disagree with anyone who says there's been a lot of overdubbing to hide goofs or whatnot. I think these performances are pretty much as they were.

I also appreciated the less-hectic editing on this DVD. The KISSymphony was a nice concert but nauseating to watch because of overzealous cutting.

The ""backstage"" featurettes were also a lot of fun.

Personally, I just fast-forward past all the 80's tunes, because I don't care for them.  For my money the killer performances were on She, Got to Choose, Love Her All I Can, Parasite, War Machine, 100,000 Years, and Unholy.  The other tunes, though performed well, I either don't care for or have good performances on (several) other DVDs.

The Powervision feature was much appreciated. It gives you the chance to just watch one performer at a time (as you might do if you were there in the good seats), and switch around to focus on what YOU want.

I say this is a good show, well filmed, great sound.  And I go back to my first KISS show in 1978, which ain't half-bad.",1183680000,,1213,4.604651162790698

2438122,5,B000BQYWZW,"Let's cut to the chase...I, like everyone else, wishes that Peter and Ace were still in the group. But it's not meant to be. There's no way anyone can view this and not love it! As far as I'm concerned, if they're going to have Tommy and Eric in the band and play this good and play interesting set lists like this...then I'm okay with it. This DVD is just awesome. The sound, the picture, the cool behind the scenes stuff, but for me the SETLIST!!! FINALLY!!! ""Love Her All I Can"" ""Unholy"" ""God Gave Rock and Roll to You"" ""Tears are Falling"" they just about do it all. It covers the entire KISS career. Sure I miss Ace singing ""NY Groove"" and Peter singing ""Beth"" - but there's just no denying this DVD.",1180569600,,704,4.2611940298507465

I remember thinking as I watched it, he must be recovering from a cold or something, because he sure sounds like he's having a hard time with those high notes.

But as a true KISS fan I'm glad I bought it, but I can't say it's the best DVD they put out.",1152057600,5,439,3.932584269662921
2438139,4,B000BQYWZW,"Overall, a pretty good DVD. Theres alot of rare songs that the band hasn't played for a while. And I will agree with some, it would be great to have Ace and Peter, but give Eric and Tommy their props. They are both unbelievable musicians and do a great job replacing Ace and Peter. Honestly, I like the Alive IV:Symphony DVD better than this, but it is still a great DVD and is worth the money.",1150848000,,394,4.197368421052632

Try putting something new out. New as in music, not bath soap or Kiss razor blades. I think the reason they don't is because they can't. (just give Gene's latest solo album a listen and you will see what I mean.) Give me something new or get lost. I gave this two stars one for Ace and one for Peter, because they remind me of when Kiss was truly the greatest band on earth! this Dvd however is more of the same worthless, played out [...].

2438141,5,B000BQYWZW,"The painted performers are back, alive, and well! After the success of their 2003 Alive IV CD and DVD, KISS releases another live DVD in time for Christmas of 2005 called ""Rock the Nation.""

The ""Rock the Nation"" tour was the 2004 Summer tour with opening act Poison. The tour took the legendary rock 'n' roll band across the United States as they performed their greatest hits of all time. This DVD is perhaps the best compilation of their greatest songs ever performed live on that tour.

Yes, this disc has some songs from every generation of KISS. It isn't juts the 70's, 80's, or 90's... It's a little bit of everything! Here's the song lists...

Disc one:

""Love Gun""

""Deuce""

""Makin' Love""

""Lick It Up""

""Christine Sixteen""

""She""

""Tears Are Falling""

""Got To Choose""

""I Love It Loud""

""Love Her All I Can""

""I Want You""

""Parasite""

Disc two:

""War Machine""

""100,000 Years""

""Unholy""

""Shout It Out Loud""

""I Was Made For Lovin' You""

""Detroit Rock City""

""God Gave Rock & Roll to You II""

""Rock and Roll All Nite""

There are very strong live performances on this disc where the band proves they are talented musicians. And, Paul proves he still has one of the best voices in rock 'n' roll. To most KISS fans, that wasn't in question at any point in history. To the KISS critics, this should shut them up.

There are theatrics on the disc as well. For example, Gene does his flight during ""Unholy"" and does all the tricks such as breathe fire and spit blood. Paul gets to fly during ""Love Gun"" much like on Alive IV.

Also on the disc, the band takes you behind the scenes and explains their pre-performance preparations and even talk about their anti-drug stance on the road.  They also show you a little glimpse at whom does what in terms of the packaging of the band.

One of the funniest things on the disc is Eric Singer. Eric tries to give Gene Simmons a lap dance and Paul calls him ""Cat Boy."" I'm sure that will piss off Peter Criss. If I were his wife, I'd run away if he watches this DVD!

Overall, it's good. It's not quite as good as Alive IV but it is still a very cool DVD for KISS fans. Now, how about hitting the studio and releasing a new album? It's been 8 years!",1147910400,4,2194,4.358910891089109

This is the parody of themselves that ""schKiss"" has become or rather sunk to. To say it's not an issue that all the original members are not present or as some others have said, theat the new ""members"" are better musicians, is simply pandering to the lowest common denominator that critics always said Kiss did for years. I used to stick up for them in this area of integrity. I will not ""Kiss their ASS anymore"". As the main greedmonger Chaim Witz aka. Gene Simmons would say, ""Kiss My Ass!'. Lose interest in this dinosaur rip-off copy of what they once were and save your money for either a quality release from a real group of musicians with some integrity like The Beatles or anyone for that matter. Anyone who entertains you and has the gut-check, gag-reflux, still operating to not heap garbage release upon garbage release of the same old songs you probably already own 10 versions of,on the heads of their apparently too-numb-to-notice fans. Each number or so-called song is as souless and shamefully for profit only, as if they needed it or were doing any civic good with it, as ever before.

That`s what the KISS Army is waiting for. And a quick note to the so-called KISS fan complaining about Eric`s make-up: the current drummer is Eric SINGER. Eric Carr sadly passed away in 1991.",1143849600,,364,4.367647058823529
2438156,2,B000BQYWZW,"I have seen these guys in the 70's and during the 90's for the ""farewell"" tour.  The key issue with this DVD and the band line up is its only 1/2 the original band.

Why is Eric Carr wearing Peter's make up and the other guy wearing Ace's spaceman costume?

Eric was in Kiss before as the ""Fox"". Why change?

Tom Thayer was a tour manager and in a Kiss tribute band.

This is only 1/2 of the classic Kiss line up even if it appears otherwise.

The DVD has a good mix of classic Kiss tunes and Paul and Gene are the heart of this band.

But without Peter and Ace you won't find ""New York Groove"", ""Shock Me"" or ""Beth"" on the set list.

Most importantly the band's best stuff was made as Paul, Gene, Ace and Peter and that's not the band anymore even if an attempt is made to portray that. Let it be known that Ace Frehley is a great lead guitarist and that is clearly missing here.",1142553600,6,880,4.046242774566474

2438161,5,B000BQYWZW,"WOW! When I got this DVD, I was a bit skeptical as I dropped it into the tray. I was not prepared for this! KISS absolutely rocked! And not just on the tunes I liked. My first KISS album was ""Alive"", in my estimation, their very best! I owned Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, my brothers a few years younger, had Creatures of the Night, etc. I saw them a few years ago on a Fourth of July thing somewhere, and thought this would be much the same, lots of pyro, with pretty good sound. I was in no way expecting this kind of performance! Unbelievable!!! I am so disgusted with myself for not attending one of the shows from '04, but feel better that I have this DVD!!! Excellent songs all the way through. I was not a fan of ""I Was Made for Loving You"", and was shocked when it was first released, The fellas played it here though, and the fans went nuts...it is still not one of my favorites, but I forgive them...as I stated, the fans in attendance loved it! The entire concert was terrific! Strutter, Got to Choose, She? Geez!!!!! Sounded as though they were ripped right off the Alive album! They played Parasite!!!!!! Man, what a performance! KISS fans...this is one to own. My brothers were very skeptical too. Now, every time they drop by, we play it. Superior video, unexpected but enormously appreciated song choices. Very little blood, one fireball released by Gene, very cool though. Paul only occasionally strayed vocally, Gene was perfect! Though Peter and Ace were not invlolved, they were not missed...as bad as that sounds. Great drum work, great lead guitar! Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer did what was asked of them and more!

2438163,3,B000BQYWZW,"The problem with this DVD is sound quality. Ok, is dolby surround, but very poor, I don't know exactly what the problem is, but if you compare an Eagles DVD(Get Over it) for example, Eagles gets a 10, and Kiss gets a 4 may be 5. If you are a Kiss fan or you really likes it,this DVD perhaps is the best one, image quality, performance on stage, but don't forget 2 of 4 members aren't the original ones.",1140739200,3,402,4.10126582278481

This double DVD set is an excellent representation of what we saw at the show.  It appears to be almost entirely taken from the Washington, DC performance, with one song only (Christine Sixteen) from Va Beach.  The band sounds good, though Paul was hoarse that night.  Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer do a fine job filling the platform boots left by Peter Criss and Ace Frehley.  Frankly, the two ""new"" guys are far better musicians than the originals--but then, nobody ever listened to KISS for their instrumental prowess.  They've written a large catalog of memorable rock and roll tunes over 30 years.  Buy this set and watch them storm through a good representative sampling of them.",1140739200,3,791,4.7299270072992705

Got To Choose, Makin Love, Christine Sixteen, Tears are Falling, and Unholy are just some songs that have never been on a live Kiss release,or haven't been in a long time.

This wasn't as good as a release from ""Black Bomb Music"" that had the original lineup in a show from the Farewell tour.  But this is a great DVD.",1140480000,,507,4.195876288659794

The mix of hits and rarities, 70s with 80s and 90s, is a perfect balance. The picture is so clear you feel like you're in the front row. It's disappointing that Ace and Peter are absent, but honestly, the band sounds tighter with Eric and Tommy. Perhaps at some point they'll release a show from the reunion tour. As for the KISS powervision: if you like the idea of picking one member to watch,have fun. I could care less and watch the show without it. The documentary footage is fun--especially the soundchecks as you get to hear bits of seldom played album cuts. This DVD was worth every penny.",1138752000,7,716,4.473282442748092
2438168,3,B000BQYWZW,"I have been and always will be a KISS fan, but this DVD is just a shame.  First off, It's not really KISS.  I had hoped that at some point a DVD would be released of the Farewell Tour with Ace and Peter, but sadly, it looks like that will probably never happen.  They also should have made Alive IV from the Farewell Tour.  (Which, by the way, should have been exactly what they said it would be.  ""The Farewell Tour""!)  I could go on about that for quite a while though.  The point is that I bought this DVD because I am a completist.  Unfortunately, this DVD just bored me.  I have had it since it was released and have only made it through about 75% of the first disc.  I just haven't felt like watching it anymore.  It just seems phony to me.

It's a disgrace to the KISS Army that these imposters have joined the ranks..can i get a KISS Court Martial here!!  ok the song selection changes from recent tours, relying less on Destroyer and more on Rock & Roll Over and Love Gun and some earlier songs are a nice change with a but of 80's-90's thrown to appease Eric Singer I guess?  Cant

Bruce Kulick wear Ace makeup? or maybe he has some respect for Ace.  Anyway...look its a good DVD, sound, bombs, song selection (for the most part) but its NOT KISS!!!!

Mark my words...if KISS was back with all Fantastic original 4 they would be playing the SUPER-BOWL~ Detroit Rock City anyone??? Gene is the smartest and knows this...expect one more KISS tour and even maybe - gulp - a new CD with all 4 orig. members (as long as they ACTUALLY play on the record)..

2438170,4,B000BQYWZW,"This is a very hard rocking, colorful, and entertaining DVD. Once you get over the fact that Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer have replaced Criss and Frehley, this is Kiss tighter than it's been in years. Certainly, it's obvious that Peter Criss cannot play anymore, so they *had to* give him his walking papers, no choice. I saw the Kiss reunion tour and Psycho Circus tour and Criss played like somebody's grandmother, and that's being kind. I still have a soft spot for him, as used to be OK at best (Alive I from 1975), and sang some classics (""Baby Driver"", ""Getaway"", ""Black Diamond""), but I saw them every time they came around with all the drummers, and Singer severely blows Criss away and the band sounds way stronger with Singer. Thayer cops Ace's highly original licks to the ""T"", and I mean exactly, plus he produced this DVD, no small feat, a true professional. Ace was the real deal, but this Tommy Thayer guy is amazing on guitar. Stanley's voice isn't what it used to be, and his wig needs a chin strap, but he's a pro showman and their stageshow on this DVD is INCREDIBLE, one of the best visual shows you'll ever see. They play ""She"", ""Love Her All I Can"", and the great ""Got To Choose"". Great, classic rock songs, nothing too cerebral, but that's ok, as Kiss are pioneers in stage theatrics and giving you huge ""bang for the buck"". They can't write worth a damn anymore, but that doesn't matter, as they already wrote so many classic, great songs in the 70's, they did their job well, and created their own world. They are fun, rocking, cool, and unique. Just grab this DVD, you'll love it. Credit is due, Kiss definitely rocks here.",1138665600,3,1649,4.518394648829432

2438172,4,B000BQYWZW,"Ever since the introduction of the DVD format, we've been told how it would revolutionize entertainment by letting us (among other things) see a movie from different angles, hear music and special effects in surround sound, and provide the clearest picture possible.  Now, several years later, the promise of the best picture has been superceded by high-definition and the ""multiple angle"" feature has rarely been used.  Only the sound and music has really delivered as promised.

Late in the DVDs life-span, seminal hard rockers KISS have released ""Rock the Nation"", a DVD that allows fans to look at the band from seven different angles as they play a set from their 2004 Rock the Nation tour.  This might not seem like a big deal but, after the debacle that was the ""KISS Symphony"" DVD, which featured the worst editing ever seen in a concert DVD, KISS has placed the editing console in the hands of their fans.  For example, if you want to watch drummer Eric Singer as he plays through ""Love Gun"" in its entirety, feel free to do so.  Dubbed ""KISS Powervision"", the multiple angle feature lets you choose what you want to see.  It's not as gimmicky as it sounds.  I found myself switching back and forth between Gene Simmons and Eric Singer the most.  If you don't want to play video director, you can just sit back and watch the concert as it was originally sequenced as well.

As for the concert itself, it's your standard KISS show, with a few curveballs thrown in.  With the substitution of Tommy Thayer (on lead guitar) and Eric Singer (on drums) for Ace Frehley and Peter Criss respectively, the band is now able to perform songs that they weren't able to do live in recent years.  So, along with the standard songs, like ""Love Gun"", ""Detroit Rock City"" and ""Rock & Roll All Nite"", the band belts out rarely played classics like ""She"", ""Parasite"", ""Love Her All I Can"", and ""Got to Choose"".  It's nice to hear some different songs from a band that seems to continuously put out the same songs over and over again.  They're not new songs but they're different ones at least.

There's also some footage of the band rehearsing, meeting fans backstage, and performing in some theaters in Australia.  Strangely, these are interspersed during the concert tracks, which breaks up the energy of the show but they're still interesting to watch nonetheless.

Coming in at slightly over two hours, ""Rock the Nation Live!"" is a worthy DVD release from the band.  I'd really like to hear what this lineup can do in terms of making some new music but I won't fault them for putting out something that is certainly worthy of buying if you're a KISS fan.",1138492800,2,2648,4.670258620689655

I especially like the ""powervision"" feature though I have only zoomed in on one of them - the guy with the star. By the way, he can take his shirt off whenever he likes!

2438196,5,B000BQYWZW,"Ok, If you are reading this then you probably want to know what kiss is about or you have been a long time soldier in the ever Growing Kiss Army.
Now, let me state that I am 19 years old and Have been in love with kiss sense I first heard their music when I was just a baby. well ok maybe not until I was five but you get the point.
I will be as unbiased toward the fact that it's not Ace and Peter, and that Gene greedy simmons is on here as I can.
The DVD is excelent. it Has some great tracks, and the band does look reenergized. Now if we could only get gene simmons to retire his position in kiss the whole band would be better off. In my beliefs, Paul stanley has carried this band sense Peter and Ace left. Gene has about two minutes worth of footage worth watching, and that comes when he is spiting fire and puking blood. other than that( thank god for scene selection and the powervision thing.
ok let me get to the point. The DVD has great behind the scenes footage of the band in the dressing room preparing and on their personal jet, at the bowling alley, and at their sound checks. the coolest special feature is you can watch them perform in some theatre shows, meaning no pyrotechnics and no flashy stage stuff that kiss is notorious for. why do i enjoy these so much. because kiss still rocks it with or with out the expensive tricks, and they would blow away any rock band out today, even slipknot and they have some cool stuff. their music sucks so they have to do something for the attention. I think gene simmons and slipknot must have hooked up for the song spit it out, because its actually a good song. (...) Ok, let me explain my title. the whole Dvd is great its kiss what can you expect, Greatness. now that covers why its good, lets cover why its sad.
1. Because Gene simmons is on it and involved in it.
2. Because Ace and Peter are not, Eric and Tommy are good, but no one is Ace Frehley, not even Van Halen.
3. Because Tommy and Eric are wearing some sacred and they shouldn't be. I am a firm believer that both of these men should be aloud to create their own personas, I am also in favor of giving Tommy Vinnie Vincents eygptian make up because it was cool and not used for long, and Eric creating his own. why because kiss is kiss and noone should be aloud to wear Ace and Peters make up. I have a theory on why this happens, but to be short i will say Gene simmons, Gene simmons must think he is god and can fool everyone. because unless you keep up with kiss on a daily basis you could look at this box art and say oh look peter and Ace are back in the band. Scheme thats my theory.
anyways. Pauls voice is great like always, and the highlight of this DVD is the performance of God gave rockn roll to you, it starts out with paul claiming kiss will be around for the next million years(exagerating) then he starts talking about the world and all of our problems, stating that we live in a time with evil terrorist, he then goes on to salute the soldiers, oh bye the way, USA the greatest country in the world, and if you are from here you better be proud of it. wether your black white asian hispanic middle eastern if you where born here you better represent. ok anyways the reason this scene is so great is because once they finally start rocking if you watch behind them on the monitors, they pay tribute to alot of great artist in rock history, The Doors, janice jopplin, Jimi hendrix, beatles, led zepplin the who. Ace frehley, Eric clapton Ace Frehley.
Ok anyways the DVD is worth the money but if you can borrow it and burn it that would be better because then Gene Simmons wouldn't get your hard earned money. peace.

2438197,4,B000BQYWZW,"I still prefer the original line-up for its magic, but those days are long gone.  All the ""replacement members"" for Peter and Ace were far superior musicians, up to and including Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer.

KISS as an iconic band may have passed its peak, but musically they are still very much alive.  Had Peter and Ace still been with the band to this day I'm afraid the music and energy would have suffered and ultimately derailed the band for good.

""Rock the Nation"" is probably the best live concert experience we will get from KISS on DVD.  Moan about the fact that someone else is wearing Peter's and Ace's makeup all you want, but it was an artistic and business choice by Gene and Paul and I can live with it.

The song selection is decent, the assorted interview/backstage/meet-n-greet pieces are a nice addition, and the whole thing is a bit more satisfying than the frat-boy antics of earlier KISS videos like ""eXposed"" in 1987.  My all-time favorite KISS long-form video was ""Extreme Close-up"" somewhere around 1992, but it was short on concert footage.  ""Rock the Nation"" is a suitable companion piece despite the 13 year gap.

For many, many years now concert technology has allowed for unobtrusive and unseen-by-the-audience teleprompters so the that singers can reference the song lyrics.  Look into it, Gene Simmons.  You've been infamous for years for the way you misremember or outright mangle song lyrics, but enough is enough.  It was charming and/or funny at first, but I'm starting to believe that you're just not making an effort anymore.  Paul, Eric, Tommy...hold an intervention or something.",1137801600,,1623,4.9010989010989015

2438199,1,B000BQYWZW,"Poor.  All of the tempos sound the same, the vocals are bad.  And I'm not into people ""dressing"" up like Peter and Ace.  Come on guys.  Take the make-up off and ROCK!",1137024000,11,166,4.09375
2438200,1,B000BQYWZW,"Wait, you got into my apartment and noticed I don't even OWN this dvd set? What you didn't know was that I didn't NEED TO own it. Right after I read that there are Ace and Peter ""look-alikes"", I realized this was not WORTH owning.

I've been a Kiss fan since '83. I know what makes Kiss. The Elder is my favorite disc. I've seen the many faces of Kiss, but to put Eric and Tommy (which I know are good musicians) in Peter and Aces faces totally cheapens what Kiss is. It's THE PEOPLE that make Kiss not the make-up. Remember the second ""Darrin"" on Bewitched? Exactly. You can't just mix and match people as though they are hardware, people MATTER TO ME.

I've had my eye on a bootleg Kiss DVD on eBay from '79 and I just might go ahead and buy THAT instead... when Kiss was Kiss. This set is an insult!!",1136764800,9,803,4.141025641025641
2438201,1,B000BQYWZW,"Okay, here's what I think happened.  One day while wig shopping, Gene says to Paul, ""Let's see how stupid our fans really are.""  Paul says ""What do you mean Gene?"" Gene replies, ""I mean, let's see how much crap our fans will actually tolerate before saying 'ENOUGH!'"" ""Oh Gene,"" Paul says, ""You know our fans are so intelligent they would never allow us to take advantage of them."" After a pause Gene says ""You're probably right Starchild, but I'm just curious.  What if we announce a farewell tour and drag it out for ten years?"" Paul laughs and offers ""Yeah, and when we play, we'll slow our songs down to half tempo and perform with the spontanaity of a traffic light!"" On a roll, Gene replies, ""...and if the fans are still buying our stuff after all of that, we'll replace half of the band with imposters!"" Gene and Paul laugh so hard they begin to choke on their gefilte fish.
  As a lifelong KISS fan, I've finally said ""ENOUGH"".  I have sadly watched a band completely destroy it's legacy and become a parody of itself.  I think I speak for many KISS fans when I say: Gene and Paul...Please, please, just stop.  Consider KISS a finished project and allow the legacy to live on without any further embarrassment.

2438202,3,B000BQYWZW,"I think KISS has finally released one DVD too many. It's cool to hear some songs that Ihaven't heard live before,but mainly it's just more of the same.

2438213,2,B000BQYWZW,"This DVD is a hard one to review. The sound is OK and the video production is top quality. But the rest puzzles me. Seeing Kiss with the original lineup some years ago made me sad. Peter and Ace were simply bad. Peter not keeping pace and Ace playing like the old worn out drunk that he was. If Kiss should go om doing shows (wich I don't think the should)it was clear that Ace and Peter would have to leave. Tommy and Eric plays Ace's and Peters parts like machines - great musicians and perfect performances. - But without the feel and attitude that Peter and Ace delivered. So far I think that I agree with most reviewers. What makes me really worried is the performance of Gene and Paul. Gene has lost his voice. If I didn't know the songs I would have had big trouble understanding what the song should sound like. And the words come out in the wrong order making the lyrics a bit of a mystery. Paul has lost all modulation of his voice and keeps shouting the same sort of tone through the entire show. Begging the audience to sing along and saying some really stupid things between songs completes the picture of a really dated and unintelligent performer. If Gene and Paul will continue to tour they have to shape up and fix their voices - or quit now.

A DVD with great technical quality and production featuring two good musicians and two old tired and worn out rock stars. Interesting to see but sad to understand that the soul and heart of the band is lost forever.",1136419200,7,1476,4.3478260869565215
2438214,2,B000BQYWZW,"I have been a KISS fan since 1978 and have seen the original band live three times. This DVD is just plain boring. It's like somebody sucked all of the air out of the building. The band totally mailed in this performance and the choice for the venue was completely wrong. KISS are arena rockers, not Amphitheater rockers!! There are all sorts of close up shots of fans having a good time....but look behind them...look at all of the long shots during the performance, the people are in a coma! Nobody is moving. Nobody is having a good time. My suspicion is that whoever directed the video controlled the show and the crowd so much that it squashed all of the spontaneity. A live DVD should be recorded strait through to capture the energy of the show. This is not the case with this DVD as it was recorded on two different nights at two different venues. I can just picture the director calling CUT! Let's try it again! That's why the crowd looks like zombies. During some of the close ups of the fans going wild I questioned if the band was even on stage at the time. It looks very coached and the people behind them look like they are at a Celine Dion concert. I watched this DVD right after watching the Motley Crue Carnival of Sins DVD, so it was like going from a raging party filled with energy to a bingo hall. And yes I'll say it....Tommy and Eric don't belong in that makeup. It just punctuated the mediocrity of the whole experience. The irony is that Gene and Paul wanted to release a DVD with superior musicianship sans Ace and Peter but now they are glaringly the worst of the bunch. The next step is to replace Gene and Paul and make KISS a franchise like BLUE MAN GROUP. For generations to come your favorite characters in makeup could be seen at permanent venues in major U.S. cities including the Las Vegas strip.",1136332800,11,1831,4.404129793510324
2438215,4,B000BQYWZW,"I just recently purchased the DVD at Best Buy, but wished I would have bought it here at Amazon, since I would have also bought Extreme Closeup for $30 total!  Oh well!

Anyway, I thought the concert was very good overall! Yes, I miss Ace and Peter, but Eric Singer is a hell of a drummer, hard hitting and very mobile!  His drum sound is excellent as compared to Peter's on Alive 4. Peter's drums did not seem to cut through as much as Eric's, but maybe this is a matter of mixing.

I would have preferred Bruce Kulick to Tommy Thayer, since Tommy appears to be copping Ace as he probably did in his tribute band days.  He plays well and it is good to see a REAL KISS fan up there, but I enjoyed Bruce's playing a lot more, as well as Bruce's overall guitar sound and technique.  But it appears (from what I have read) that Ace is happy with Tommy in the makeup, so, there you have it.

Songs such as Makin Love, Love Her All I Can, Got to Choose, I Want You and Tear are Falling are really cool to hear live.  I wish they would have done these songs during the reunion days, but apparently Paul and Gene state that the other boys ""could not play all the songs"" or something to that effect. I don't buy it!  None of those songs sound very difficult to play, even for a novice guitar player like me! Other songs like Fits Like a Glove, Take it Off and Rock and Roll Hell would have been great additions, in my humble opinion!

If you are a casual or more fan, buy the DVD. If you are hardcore and hate the replacements, then get over it!  I don't think the other guys will come back, nor do I think Paul Stanley can continue much longer, given his hip surgery!  The songs are good, the sound is good and the extras are cool!  It was worth the $25 I paid at Best Buy, so get it here with the other DVD!",1136246400,6,1801,4.067988668555241

I saw my first concert in 85 for the Asylum tour and the first video I saw was Live: Uncensored.  Those were the good days.  Once Kiss removed the make up, they entered a different realm and should have remained there.  There style shifted with the trends, but that was ok.  I admit I was slightly dissapointed when they put the make up back on but still remained a fan.  The ""Rock the Nation"" DVD should have been filmed with all original members and not this way.  Singer and Thayer are awesome, but they are not Ace and Peter.  Although this DVD illustrates that these guys still have it, it is a slight dissapointment to the original fan base and shows that they are still marketing the name Kiss and not considering what true Kiss fans really want to see.  If you are gonna wear the makeup, you need to have peter and ace.",1136160000,6,994,4.295698924731183
2438219,4,B000BQYWZW,"I'm one of the die-hards, I guess.  My brother got me the first KISS album in 1974, and I have been a believer ever since.  After they took the makeup off in 83, KISS died, not just visually but musically as well.  Even in their pop phase (1979-81), they still were original.  Then off came the make-up.  The trend-setters blended in with the scenery and became just another hair band.  Their album sales shot up with a new teen metal fan base.  They were starting fresh, and the make-up KISS was now legend and gone forever.  Fans were now desperate for any scrap they would throw out.  They got me fired up with ""Revenge"" in 92, going back to the nasty, hard edge that I got with ""Hotter Than Hell"".  ""MTV Unplugged"" was a thrill.  The reunion tour was great.  It should have ended there.

OK, now this DVD.  If you're new to the KISS bandwagon and have never seen a show, definitely this DVD is awesome.  However, if you're an old fart like me that grew up with these guys, this really dosn't feel right, especially if you own videos of Houston, Cobo, and Winterland.  Does it bother me that Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer are on stage wearing the makeup?  Yep!  Are they more accomplished musicians than their predecessors?  Yep!  But that's not the point.  It's not about accomplished musicianship.  It's about TRADITION (eat your heart out, Topol!)  One reviewer said that a few seconds into the show, you will forget that Ace and Peter are not there.  I just can't do that.  Sorry.  Certainly, Tommy and Eric can play the licks and sticks in their sleep.  But I don't want veggies and avion with my burger.  I want my fries and my Coke!  My brother was a huge Beatles fan, and I asked him years ago when the remaining members got together for the anthology if it would be neat if someone like Robin Zander or Jeff Lynne could fill Lennon's absence and go on a ""reunion tour"" as the new Fab 4.  His response to me was, ""It would be cool.  Just DON'T DO IT!""  I never understood what he meant until now.

It's nice to hear them dive into some of the obscure stuff, especially ""Love Her All I Can"" which is one of my favorite KISS tunes.  The camera work and sound are terrific.  The Powervision feature is also pretty neat.  However, I wish they would have rather cleaned up Houston '77 or make an anthology of live perfomances through 1982.  THAT would be ultimate!",1135987200,4,2369,4.412993039443156
2438220,3,B000BQYWZW,"The performance was excellent.  All 4 musicians were on the top of their game, lead by Paul's energy and enthusiasm.  It was well filmed and well recorded.  Being a Paul Stanley fan for 25 years, I am sorry to say I lost respect for him in under one minute with his ignorant political speech.  As soon as the shock wore off, I had to sell the dvd.",1135900800,4,347,4.134328358208955
2438221,5,B000BQYWZW,"I have just seen the ""Kiss: Rock the Nation"" DVD, and all I can say is, ""Wow.""  Great performance; good 5.1 sound mix, great-looking filming and HD transfer, and good bonus features (although why they couldn't fit what is essentially a two-hour show onto one DVD is beyond me).  But still, overall impressive.  I must admit I was skeptical of the ""Rock the Nation"" tour for a number of reasons.  Mainly, one:  I had seen Kiss on the previous ""Psycho-Circus"" tour and was disappointed (especially after seeing the great reunion tour just a few years earlier), and two:  I thought, ""If Ace and Peter can't sound any better than that, what makes anyone think that a couple of scrubs could do any better?""  So, I sat that tour out, saved my money, and stayed at home.  When I heard reports of an ""incredible"" show, I thought to myself, ""What a bunch of deluded fanboys.  These must be those same people who go to all of those conventions and defend 'The Elder' as high art.  These people are worse than deadheads.""

But then, Aerosmith came to town with Kiss opening, and the opportunity to see my two favorite rock bands from the '70's touring together was too good to pass up.  I have to say, I was impressed.  Peter Criss was back behind the drum kit, but what surprised me the most was that I didn't miss Ace.  I mean, when I saw close-ups of Tommy Thayer on the monitor screens, I could obviously tell it wasn't Ace, but that didn't bug me.  It was a really good show.  Still for the time between the show and the release of this DVD, I doubted my memories of the concert.  Was it really that good, or was I just so pumped-up over the experience of seeing Kiss and Aerosmith together that I was overrating it?  Now that I have this DVD, I know I was right.  Not only that, but now I don't miss Peter, either.  I have been a Kiss fan for 30 years, but I agree with the reviewer who compared a Kiss live show to a theater production, a la London or Broadway.  The cast may change, but that just keeps the show fresh, if anything.

One additional comment, though; and this really bugs me:  Stop treating Amazon.com as a forum / blog thread.  This is a product review site.  If you haven't seen the product, don't post.  If you want to rant about the ""new, fake Kiss,"" go to a genuine metal news / blog site like blabbermouth.com.  Those guys would love you.  They have turned Kiss-bashing into an art-form / pastime.  But when you post a one-star review of a DVD you haven't seen because you disagree with it on general principal, it brings the overall rating of the DVD down artificially, which could turn-off potential Amazon customers / Kiss fans like myself, who might genuinely like the DVD on its own merits.  (And I think it's interesting to note that the reviews posted by the people who have actually seen the DVD are overwhelmingly positive).  As for me, this is going up on my shelf, right next to my ""import"" copy of Kiss - Love Gun:  Houston, 1977.",1135728000,35,2959,4.402214022140221
2438222,5,B000BQYWZW,"No doubt, this is my favorite KISS live DVD. My other favorites are Konfidential, Unplugged and Symphony. I have been a fan since 1979 and have travelled to New York and Australia to see them perform live. The rhythm section by Eric Singer, Paul and Gene is the tightest of all KISS line-up. That makes this line-up and the Revenge era my favourite KISS line-up. No particular set list can makes every fan satisfied. Rarely performed KISS classics? Not really. 15 of the 20 songs are from the Revenge tour set list. The new ones are Making Love, She, Got to Choose, Love Her All I Can, 100000 Years. And they dropped 10 songs from the Revenge tour including Watching You, Cold Gin, Heavens on Fire, Creatures.",1135641600,3,709,4.590551181102362
2438233,2,B000BQYWZW,"A lot reviews keep saying that this DVD has great audio.  Come off it, this stinks!!!  I'm a kiss fan and always have been, but I would be embarrassed for nonkiss friends to hear this.  This concert doesn't have a solid sound; in fact sometimes it sounds disorganized.  Just compare this mess to AC/DC ""Stiff upper lip live"".  Now that's a concert!  All the theatrics and great camera work in the world can not make up for a lousy sound, but that's why I gave it one extra star.",1135382400,2,478,4.314606741573034
2438234,5,B000BQYWZW,"When Gene and Paul get up and Perform, they have few rivals. The concert material is superb; the visuals are great, and as one said at the end of the concert DVD, disc 2, the band is tight ( mainly thanks, I suspect, to Eric Singer).
The Audio is excellent in 5.1, and whomever is responsible for the Concert Video production is great. The band is in fine KISS form, and well worth the price for that. The Bombast and the Pyro make this a spectacle, despite what Paul and Gene say on this DVD  about the ""Theatre  Shows""[ read... stripped down and on the cheap; Gene has always said that any Garage  Band can play their songs, but NO-ONE can do their show... so true.]

Visually, I would compare this to the Concert done through NHK ( Japanese National Broadcaster) at a Theatre down south in the Late 90's with visuals beyond good[ I forget the name, and I can't find the tape at this time, but the lighting was great, and the camera work was standard  superb NHK  work]). I have been waiting for a DVD  release from KISS that suits the medium. And this does. One surprise about the pack was the quality of the outer slip: it's very good. I had expected something a little less glossy, but the silver, and raised lettering on the outer slip are very nice. Also, the booklet is quite nice, but definitely not excessive, especially strange with a band known for its  visual  excesses ... a visual booklet with plenty of blurb and visual fluff would have been quite nice ( like some of the booklets in the 70s  where the mythic, iconic hyperbole just made it extra fun to get a KISS product of any kind).

The Extras are Very good, especially GOING BLIND( done in 2.1 Stereo), and a Rehearsal Session( also in 2.1).
BUT... Where is the Documentary on KISS  Powervision??? It says  it is there on the Box, but not there on the disc at all. And why are the Two Discs both 8 GIG DVD's ? If they had  used the 11 GIG template, the Concert, could have been on one disc, and the Documentary stuff and etc on another. The Documentary material is more like Commercials  for ""well, we did this thing, because we had reasons ... x,y,z"". It gets back to the Statement Paul makes  ""Let the Music  do the Talking"". And Gene's mantra about the fans ... NOT TRUE.
Tommy Thayer is on record about what constitutes a good Concert DVD, and then he is credited as being the producer of this... I suspect Gene and Paul were the un-credited Executive producers who over-rode what Tommy did or *might* have done.

Some Fun Stuff:
About  5-6  minutes into the first DVD, is a quick cut of a Kid who looks to be in severe  pain, and is sticking his fingers in his ears( Music  critics  start young).
59 Minutes into the Second DVD, a quick cut of Gene shows him making an indescribable  face, and clapping his hands in such a way that makes me think he should be carrying a tamborine.
During the Moment Paul is ""smashing"" the Guitar, he is totally  aware that the fog has made him invisible, so he pauses, looking very ""upset"", and then  resume his Schtick.

I have no problem with Paul not  wearing a top. Its the people in the back seats who copy him that should be prohibited from wearing a top !!!

Tommy has FINALLY  learned to get Ace's riffs NOTE perfect !! As well as doing the Ace Harmonic Whistle bend ( i.e. Tommy is an Ace clone, no two ways about that).
Eric Singer is a Brilliant drummer, he is more Peter than Peter, and More Power to Eric ( Eric is the consummate Drummer for hire, and After Seeing his Concert DVD  work  with Alice Cooper, you can see just how great Eric  is in this role)!!!

When On stage, No Documentary, No Political Comment, Paul and Gene, and the Current KISS Lineup, all perform, they are Killer. Personally, I don't care what Paul and Gene think ... just play, and Let Gene air his views on Bill Mahers shows. Gene and Paul on stage are unbeatable. It's sad that the originals are not there, but the Clones are such good copies of the originals, that the Show Blasts  away the rest. Hopefully some more concerts will be done in 5.1, and some rare  material such as ALL THE WAY might be played.",1135382400,3,4109,4.339449541284404
2438235,4,B000BQYWZW,"I'm guessing Gene & Paul heard the complaints about the fast editing of the Alive IV DVD because this one is a lot better not to mention the 'Power Vision' feature on 7 songs(you can keep the camera on one band member for the entire song if you want).  I'm glad they FINALLY changed it up a little... playing ""Unholy"" and ""War Machine""(w/the sirens and lights at the end! woo-hoo) in particular.  The more interesting part of the DVD, for me, is the behind the scenes segments.  If you want to hear the songs, you have Alive IV, Kofidential, Animalize Live, Exposed and all the other 'official' home videos.  Here you get to see the band rehearse in a motel room with little amps and hear songs they haven't done in concert(""The Oath"", ""All The Way"", etc), or see the band talk to the fans(the ones who have MONEY to pay for the plantium pass or whatever it's called).  If your a Kiss fan, you will like this DVD.  I agree with a lot of people about this one...It's their best concert DVD to date and if there is overdubs, it's really hard to tell.  The band's 1993 home video ""Kofidential"" was so overdubbed it was distracting... the worse concert video of ANY band I've ever seen.  This is the one to have.  It even beats the Alive IV DVD.

2438236,4,B000BQYWZW,"An awesome DVD. Being a die hard KISS fan and seeing KISS in concert three times,it is awesome for me to get to watch KISS live and in concert from my living room(and anywhere I want,as I now have a portable DVD player)pretty much anytime I want to. This is,for the most part,the KISS DVD that us KISS fans have been waiting for for years.

This is a two DVD set,and while it is not perfect,it was put together quite well and is quite entertaining. It shows KISS live and in concert at a concert hall that is in the District of Columbia in 2004. I'll talk about this whole DVD step by step from here,and mention my thoughts,comments,and opinions on the whole thing:

1. The set list isn't perfect,but it is pretty decent. It is nice to see KISS performing some of their best material from the 70's,80's,and 90's,and I'll list a letter grade on the track selection here of KISS material from the 70's,80's,and the 90's. The selection of KISS material from the 70's performed live on this DVD(""Love Gun"",""Deuce"",""Makin' Love"",""Christine Sixteen"",""She"",""Got To Choose"",""Love Her All I Can"",""I Want You"",""Parasite"",""100,000 Years"",""Shout It Out Loud"",""I Was Made For Lovin' You"",""Detroit Rock City"",and

""Rock and Roll All Nite"")deserves an A,the selection of KISS material from the 80's here(""Lick It Up"",""Tears Are Falling"",""I Love It Loud"",and ""War Machine"")is at a B,and the selection of KISS material performed live here from the 90's(""Unholy"" and ""God Gave Rock & Roll To You"")is a C plus. Sorry that I couldn't give the track selection of material performed live from the 70's,80's,and 90's ***all*** an A plus,but where are live performances of ""Sure Know Something"",""Heaven's on Fire"",""Forever"",and both ""Dreamin'"" and the title track from KISS' ""Psycho Circus"" reunion album?

2. The bonus feautures here are good. If you happen to be particular fond of either Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Tommy Thayer(Ace Frehley's replacement guitarist in KISS),or Eric Singer(who,as we all know,is KISS' current drummer,and has taken over for both Eric Carr and Peter Criss),you can use ""powervision"" on seven KISS songs here on this DVD. ""Powervision"" is where you can hear the live performance of a certain song and choose whether or not you are just going to watch Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Tommy Thayer,or Eric Singer!!!! How cool is that???? Very cool!!!! It is also cool to get to see clips of KISS on the road,backstage,and among several other cool things that are on this DVD,a photo gallery of KISS. I give Tommy Thayer(who actually put this DVD together)two thumbs up for the production of this DVD.

3. The sound on this DVD is good,and KISS' performance here,for the most part,is decent. While Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer may not be either Ace Frehley or Peter Criss,both Thayer and Singer are very talented,and their talent shows on the concert that is on this DVD. Thayer's guitar parts during the live performances of ""Tears Are Falling"" and ""Unholy"" are on fire,it is very cool to see Gene Simmons do his whole blood splitting/being brought to the top of the arena during the live performance of ""Unholy""(never saw or thought about it happening until now,but still very cool)

and I like Paul Stanley's spirit and attitude during/before live performances of ""God Gave Rock&Roll To You II"" and ""Rock and Roll All Nite"",on which KISS has the stage nicely arranged.

4. This DVD has a nice booklet accompanying it,which has notes on both KISS and this DVD from Ken Sharp,KISS' 2004 tour dates,pictures of Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Tommy Thayer,and Eric Singer both all together and seperate from each other,and info about the whole production behind KISS' concerts and this DVD. It is nice to have that here.

The Bottom Line:This DVD proves that KISS really are ""The Hottest Band in the World"",and it is a must have for ***all*** KISS fans. Need I say more?",1135209600,3,3862,4.995334370139969
2438237,1,B000BQYWZW,"WARNING!!! This DVD sucks! I give it a star just for production quality...nothing else!!! Obviously by now, greed for money and power have taken the best of Gene and Paul. Their ego went too far this time by stealing Ace and Peter's stage persona. Who wants to see other guys dressed up as KISS anyway. I see that enough during halloween, HA HA HA! That's too bad. This move was unnecessary and distracting enough to ruin the whole show for me. Actually, it would've been way better if they had no makeup at all.

After reading a lot of these previous positive fan reviews I understand now. If you have no respect for yourself and like KISS just for tradition, be like these other suckers and get this DVD, HA HA HA!!!",1135209600,3,718,4.4393939393939394
2438238,5,B000BQYWZW,"This is a quality production DVD with high entertaining value. Definitely worth it.

Who cares if Peter or Ace have been replaced. Heck, who cares if even Gene or Paul get replaced. Get over it! We don't really need none of them anyway. There's enough good music already. KISS is way bigger than any original band member! As long as the characters, the music and the show is there, that's all we fans care. Of course they'll have to act, look, sing and play like Gene, Paul, Peter & Ace. Think of KISS like a classic theater play like the Phantom of the Opera or Peter Pan. Many different actors have played those roles through the years but nobody complains about that and still like the show. We fans don't think of KISS as a band anymore but as a show. KISS the band is done but the show must go on. If you look at it this way you'll enjoy this DVD. Plus, as real fans, we will give 5 stars for everything KISS anyway, if for tradition only...",1135123200,3,946,4.2555555555555555

2438240,5,B000BQYWZW,"Paul Stanley's recent assertion that the ""Rock the Nation Live!"" DVD showcases a ""timeless representation of KISS"" is completely accurate.  As being among the most die-hard of die-hard KISS fans, I was as sad as any other KISS fans when Ace and Peter departed from the band once again.  However, I didn't let my disappointment keep me from supporting the band that had given me so much over the years.  In fact, I was excited about hearing a rejuvenated KISS on tour in 2004, especially when I learned the band would be playing a different setlist from the previous tours with the inclusion of a few rare songs.  I was fortunate enough to attend the Washington, D.C. show that was used for much of this DVD, and I can confidently say that the DVD captures the energy and magic of the night.  Granted, I might be somewhat biased since I attended the show, but I think the DVD captures the band at its tightest.  The songs are clear, and Eric Singer's drumming is phenomenal.  Though an Ace-penned song, ""Parasite"" ironically demonstrates the strengths of the current lineup.  Tommy plays Ace's licks quite well--and I take that to be a compliment to the one and only Space Ace--and Tommy allows the riff to be somewhat muddy whereas Bruce Kulick may have played it a bit too precise.  On the other hand, Eric's impeccable timing allows the song to reach its full sonic potential.  Another highlight of the DVD is the inclusion of ""Tears Are Falling;"" seeing the band perform an Asylum-era song in makeup is quite refreshing; it allows fans to see proof that KISS, despite the various members, has been consistently solid for 30 years.  Sure, they've had some lame releases (Asylum certainly one of them), but overall the band has time and again delivered to the fans.  This DVD allows us fans to see KISS in all their timeless glory.  If you're a KISS fan, even a casual KISS fan, you'll be hard-pressed to not enjoy the DVD.  There are plenty of extras too and lots of familiar faces in the crowd, so wait no longer...Buy this DVD today!  God bless KISS, and God bless the KISS Army!!",1135036800,3,2084,4.609756097560975
2438241,1,B000BQYWZW,"Dressing up people as Ace and Peter is SSSSSOOOOOooooo pathetic! If your young and never saw the glory days,I understand. But really how sad is this?Getting Tommy Thayer to dress up as someone else and to play Ace's solos ""INSTEAD"" of his own is Gene and Paul screaming""we would rather you were someone else"".Imagine if your best friend split up with his or her girlfriend or boyfriend. Time goes by and next time you see them they are with someone dressed up like thier ex...and they paid them to act like the person too. Welcome to the current KISS line-up. This dvd is Gene and Paul playing roles they did years ago. Acting like a band that DOES NOT exist anymore. They should get over it and release a dvd of a ""real""KISS line-up.(One that does not portray other people).SAD!

P.S.That's the thing about money Bud...it sometimes makes ya' do things you wouldn't normaly do.(From the film ""Wall Street"").",1135036800,5,907,4.70440251572327
2438242,4,B000BQYWZW,"So let's see. A bunch of people complain that Peter and Ace aren't here. Hmmmm let's see why. Ace was probably too high to show up (that's NOT him on half of Destroyer, and it's Bob Kulick on every song except for Rocket Ride on the studio side of Alive II because Ace was too wasted.) Don't get me wrong- i grew up a HUGE Ace Frehley fan, but after reading about him being a neo nazi worshipper, i can see the OBVIOUS conflict between him and the Jews (Gene and Paul) so Ace, the drug addict Nazi, got his walking papers. And Peter, bless his soul, was PHONING IN his performances towards the end of his second stint with Kiss. (Anybody own Alive IV?? Check out Peter rushing his fills HORRIBLY OUT OF TIME on Deuce. It is NOT pretty) So yeah Gene and Paul ARE in it for the cash, but let's face it- the new and improved version of Kiss features better players who are more reliable and who play songs that we otherwise wouldn't get to hear. Anybody who listens to this DVD and then listens to old kiss objectively CANNOT tell me that this is not a more improved version of the band. Yeah- it IS a cover band, but this cover band plays better than the original- and I should know- my first Kiss concert was on the Dynasty tour. So kids, quit yer bitchin and face the facts- the DVD kicks ass.",1134691200,7,1293,4.196787148594377
2438253,5,B000BQYWZW,"Just watched the DVD last night. What a great production!!! The set list was awesome, though everybody will ""wish they played..."". Kiss could play for 5 hours and not cover everything we all want, but to hear 'Love Her All I Can' one of my faves, 'Parasite', 'Got To Choose', and an incredible remake of 'She' from Alive. Tommy Thayer made a lot of lifetime fans after that one! It was sad to see the lame front row crowd sitting down during the tunes that don't appear on every greatest hits record. If you're going to sit in the front few rows, you'd better know all the songs. Those seats should be  reserved for true fans, not the 10th caller to the radio station. Kiss powervision allows the viewer to watch any of the 4 band members during 7 of the songs, this is cool if you want to just check out one or all at any point of the selected tune. This DVD has been in the works for 6 years. I can honestly say it was worth every day of that wait. Check out the sound check segment, you'll hear 'All the Way', 'The Oath', 'Two Timer', and 'Comin Home'.

The only flaw in this DVD is the 6 interruptions between songs. They stuck in some awesome behind the scenes stuff, but during the show? Those little 3 minute pieces were great, but they belonged after the concert in a bonus section. Oh, and Gene... please listen to 'I Love It Loud' on the plane to get the verses right! We love you man, I'd hate to see an OZZY teleprompter in front of you!!!

All in all, this is the DVD true KISS fans have waited for. Fabulous sound, production, and video quality. No orchestra in the background. Just sraight ahead rock, as only KISS knows how to !. Buy it...buy it...buy it...buy it.",1134691200,22,1680,4.2933753943217665
2438254,5,B000BQYWZW,"Great performances. Great sound. Great picture. Excellent song choices. Cool extras. Thoroughly entertaining all the way through.

In the 70s Kiss was it. It was cool to be into Kiss. In the 80s, it was the exact opposite. By the late 80s and early 90s the makeup was off and Kiss was a (no pun intended) washed up ""bunch of posers.""

This DVD dispells the myth that Kiss were ever posers. They indeed were always great musicians and they were the inspiration for many metal bands rocking your world today (did you know while backsatge at a 70s Kiss show that Eddie Van Halen's signature guitar tapping was inspired while seeing Ace Frehley do it?). And they so happen to put on one of the most theatrical shows in rock and roll history.

And that history is captured on this 2-disk DVD. Each disk has some great bonus material...some mixed into the play lists on both disks and some available right on the disk 2 main menu. But the real treat is the front row seat to a great performance from Washington, DC in 2004.

I am sure that most are aware of the ""doctoring"" that the Kiss Alive album is now infamous for. With this DVD, it's clear that the guys also wanted to dispell the myth that their live performances needed doctoring. You are clearly getting undoctored versions of all the songs, no lip syncing, actual performances. And before the boys hit the stage they must have all agreed to be true to the studio versions of the songs, because they all sound great! You get:

Disc one:
""Love Gun""
""Deuce""
""Makin' Love""
""Lick It Up""
""Christine Sixteen""
""She""
""Tears Are Falling""
""Got To Choose""
""I Love It Loud""
""Love Her All I Can""
""I Want You""
""Parasite""

Disc two:
""War Machine""
""100,000 Years""
""Unholy""
""Shout It Out Loud""
""I Was Made For Lovin' You""
""Detroit Rock City""
""God Gave Rock & Roll to You II""
""Rock and Roll All Nite""

On about 7 of the tracks you have the option of watching your favorite performer throughout the song. And for the preservationists that might suggest that it's not really Kiss without Ace and Peter Criss...please...think again. Tommy Thayer (guitar) and Eric Singer (drums) are...I hate to say it...even better musicians than their original counterparts. And with the makeup you forget that your not watching the originals about 6 seconds into the first clip on the DVD.

Bottom line: Are you or were you ever a Kiss fan? Don't pass on this. Hit the Add to Cart button. Don't think twice.",1134691200,80,2426,4.586605080831409
2438255,5,B000BQYWZW,"I've been a KISS fan since 1975 and have lived through all the highs and lows. Somehow these guys manage to survive and get stronger and this DVD shows a revitalized band. The playing's tight, the production is beautiful, the set list is fantastic. I miss Ace and Peter but Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer earn the make-up here without a doubt. Despite the fact that this set includes ""Tears Are Falling"" and ""I Was Made for Loving You"", the two worst KISS tunes ever penned in my opionion, I love everything about this DVD. If you've never seen KISS live, this is as close as you'll ever get. Here in all their fire-breathing, blood-spitting, bombastic glory KISS show why they've endured for over three decades. Put it on, turn it up and rock and roll all night!",1134691200,3,761,4.521739130434782
2438256,5,B000BQYWZW,"This is simple. Go buy this dvd now. See and hear the new ""revitalized"" KISS destroy the competition. If you liked the KISS Symphony or the KISS Unplugged dvds you'll love this one. Great audio/visual quality. Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer do a fantastic job (as usual). This is like listening to an updated version of KISS ALIVE. Gene's voice sounds a little hoarse but that's understandable, considering this show was filmed midway through the tour. His bass playing however, is absoulutely brilliant. He changes several bass lines and does some improvisations that sound very cool and add new life to the songs. Paul sounds really good. My only complaint is that he should've contributed more to the background vocals (and he should've shared vocals with Gene on Parasite). Personal highlights include: Making Love, She, Love Her All I Can, I Want You, Parasite, Unholy, Christine 16, 100,000 Years and Tears Are Falling. If you still don't own any KISS dvds then start with this one, you won't regret it. How about a new album next?",1134691200,4,1035,4.886363636363637

Tommy and Eric have earned their stripes, and this video is a total masterpiece!! Still the hottest band in the world: KISS!!!",1134604800,5,317,4.660714285714286
2438258,3,B000BQYWZW,"OK the dvd verdict.  It's not as good as Alive IV or The Last KISS, but I added it to my KISS collection.  I like to see a full legnth concert from start to finish.  This has cuts to documentry footage.  They've editted two different concerts together.  I did like to hear tears are falling and God gave rock and roll to you, Unholy, and a few others that they haven't played for some time.  The set looked really cool and I liked the feature where you got to choose the camera angle, however, this feature only works on a few songs..  If you remember Alive IV the cuts were too fast.  You couldn't take time to watch the shots you wanted.  I was a little disopointed that there weren't more extras on a double disk set.

Don't hate Eric Singer......  Give Gene and Paul the Finger instead.  I don't like the makeup on Tommy and Eric.  Eric Singer has been a member of Black Sabbith, Alice Cooper, and KISS. He is a fantastic drummer.  He is the member who wanted Peter to join the band at the konvention and later unplugged.  This later lead to the reunion.  For that we are greatly in his debt and must forgive him for the makeup.  KISS has better chemistry with Peter Criss.  There's not getting around that.  Tommy Thayer is an awsome guitarist but he is just an  ""Ace Clone.""  At least Eric changes it up a and plays the stuff differenty.  Don't forget that Peter got a call from Eric Carr about the Beth rerecording.  Carr hoped he would be hated for singing Peter's classic song.  Gene and Paul made him do it.  I'm sure they are making Eric and Tommy do the same now.  It's such a disservice to a great drummer to wear another drummer's makeup and not have his own identity.  I watch him play but pretend he's not wearing Peter's makeup.  I think that you'll be happier a few kissvission bootlegs from the original lineup on ebay.",1134604800,2,1838,4.326470588235294

2438260,1,B000BQYWZW,"There is only one Kiss (in makeup) and it is Ace, Peter, Paul & Gene.  This dvd is from a 1/2 cover band's tour trying to be Kiss.  My first show was 1975.  My last was the ""Farewell Tour"".

If you want to see a Kiss in makeup tour dvd, wait.  If you want to see a Kiss cover band, spend your $20.00 at the door of some bar, not on this crap.  Because, before you know it, it won't even be Gene & Paul up there anymore either!!!  Save your money for when the good stuff comes out.......",1134518400,7,486,3.8484848484848486
2438261,5,B000BQYWZW,"I had been anxiously awaiting this DVD since I heard about it coming out just a couple weeks ago as I have been a Kiss fan as long as most everyone else here.  I was reluctant at first because I saw the Kiss Symphony DVD which I didn't care for that much and wondered how I would react to not seeing Peter and Ace with the band (and new members wearing their makeup as well) but I knew that I would buy it out of curiousity and as a longtime Kiss fan.

As a Kiss fan, or fan of any band it is hard for me (or anyone)  to give an unbiased review so I'll try to talk about  the DVD as a rock concert DVD without trying to mention Kiss.  Probably the only disappointment is that it's not all on 1 DVD which probably can not be helped due to it's length.  The concert has a nice flow, with starting with images of the band to the crowd and intro. of the band.  It sounds good, it's loud and it rocks.  The band members all play well together and seem happy and that permiates into the crowd.  A lot of positive energy back and forth between the band and audience  (nice looking concert facility in D.C. area btw).  It shows a band that loves to do what they do for a living and really loves their fans.  Their are nice breaks in the concert, showing segments related to the concert tour, backstage, etc.... it is a nice break- rather than going from song to song nonstop and I like the not-too-tight editing, being able to see and hear what Paul Stanley has to say to the audience inbetween songs.  It really gave me a feeling of being there, at the venue and brought me back in time to when I saw them in Ft. Worth, Texas 4 years ago.  A real nice segment is the bonus show of doing one song in an intimate theatre size venue - without any special effects.

I didn't get the sense of them being a tribute band in this DVD, it would be awfully hard to duplicate exactly what they do.  As for the two new members - well I can understand where the purist might be upset (especially with Ace and Peter's makeup not retired - as that could stir the debate of copyright?) but think about how many bands that have been around 30 years + and have all of their original band members?  All the classic rock bands playing right now I can not think of a single band from 30 years ago with all of their original members, Aerosmith maybe the only one and that is rare.  Other bands, Deep Purple, Blue Oyster Cult, Kansas, Styx, etc....... all still playing with adjusted lineups and very well received - as Kiss appears to be in this DVD concert.  Of course it doesn't compare to Kiss in 1978, it's not supposed to - it doesn't work that way with any band.  I enjoyed Kiss in 1978 and enjoy them today.  (I wouldn't want to live in 1978 again anyways, I'd rather see something of the present)  It's about the spirit of rock and roll and the positive energy and enthusiasm a rock concert produces and few are better at it than Kiss and this DVD shows it.  It's not my favorite all-time concert DVD but definitely my favorite from Kiss.  I don't care if they produce a new DVD every year, in fact the more they produce the better each one gets as perhaps they learn from each one.  You can argue that a band should have only 1 concert DVD but I have seen quite a few concert DVD's from classic rock bands that were pretty weak.  Gene and Paul are serious performers who are not going to bring in any slackers or half-hearted musicians. I'd say they knew what they were doing bringing Tommy and Eric into the band.  What would be the point in having Ace and Peter in the band if they weren't enjoying themselves onstage?",1134518400,3,3600,4.187227866473149
2438262,5,B000BQYWZW,"I had bought this on Amazon however could not wait. Now I have two and let me tell you it is worth it!

2438273,4,B000BQYWZW,"I too have been a Kiss fan for decades, tracing my Kisstory back to 1976 and ""Destroyer.""  I loved all of the good times, and all of the so-called bad times.  I listened as avidly to ""Elder"" as I did ""Love Gun,"" as passionately to ""Unmasked"" as I did ""Revenge.""  Kiss as a group has ALWAYS been the brainchild of Gene Simmons & Paul Stanley, born out of the bizarre group Wicked Lester.  Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were the ingredients that made the band the ""hottest in the world,"" and they live on as part of the Kiss family.  So do Eric Carr, Vinnie Vincent, Mark St. John, Bruce Kulick, Eric Singer, and now Tommy Thayer.  (Should we include Anton Fig on the list as well?)  Anyway...what I'm trying to say is this:  the only reason people claim to be a ""true fan"" of WHATEVER era of the band is because they're passionate about the band...and that's all that the guys in Kiss ever wanted.  Love 'em or hate 'em...just don't IGNORE 'em!

And you CAN'T ignore the high quality audio & visual of this concert.  After going backstage on the Platinum Pass during the shared concert tour with Aerosmith, I sat the Rock the Nation tour out.  I have NO trouble giving my money to people who work hard, but I found it hard to think about going back to the nosebleed seats after having Paul Stanley shake my hand.  I eagerly waited for the DVD of the tour, though, and I must say it doesn't disappoint!  The guys all play very well, Gene remembers most of his lyrics (if in a rearranged order), and the visuals are stunning.  Kudos to the interspersed bonus features too, although I wish there was a menu choice to let you JUST watch those without skipping chapters.

Final analysis:  this is Kiss, now, in 2005.  Those who don't want them can listen to whatever era music they think is the best.  I personally want Kiss in my life, and this DVD gives 'em to me.  Twenty bucks for 2 DVDs...ya can't beat it.  If you don't want it, don't buy it...but I think if you SEE it you'll be convinced that it's well worth the investment of time & money.",1134518400,30,2040,4.343915343915344

 Everything from the energy of the band, the sound, setlist, and bonus features make this a real keeper.

 The  select-a-kiss feature is my fave, as I get to focus on different members during select songs.

 Some here (the one that hasn't seen the vid) feel that it's a rip-off because it isn't the ""real KISS""

Well ,it definitely is the real deal. JUst watch Eric for a whole song. He definitely CAN play...one of the best out there. And he's a showman too. Which is precisely what KISS is about.

 This blows away their ""Last KISS PPV"" performance by a longshot.

I was absolutely not disappointed. I received the DVD this morning and I have watched it twice already. I love the extras and of course the entire concert. I saw them in Buffalo a few weeks before this was filmed and while I was there I picked up the ""Instant Live"" cd and I haven't stopped listening to it. Every time I hear it, I can picture being at the show. Now I can watch the show...even better!!! I don't know what all of you ""so called long time fans"" are complaining about. Sure it is not Ace or Peter under all of that make-up but Tommy is the guy who had to teach Ace all of his solos when Ace rejoined the band. Whether you know it or not (I would hope you know if you are all big fans like you say you are) Ace and Peter didn't even play on most of the albums when they were in the band. I think that if nothing else Tommy should get the credit for finally putting together an absolutely fabulous KISS DVD...not to mention being able to get up on that stage in front of fans like you and playing his heart out knowing that there are whiners like you out there watching his every move. If you don't like the band the way it is, then get out. Go listen to some rap,or some other YOYOYOYOYO crap. At least my favourite band is still out there doing something after over 30 years. Sorry to ramble but I get sick of reading these complaints from so caled long time KISS fans. If you were really fans you would support your ""Favourite Band"". KISS will always be there for you to enjoy so why can't you return the favour and back them.

Its about playing with feeling and emotion. If I want technical proficiency I will listen to Rush, Yes, etc. KISS have never been about superior musicianship.

I went with my wife to DC and my sister to Virginia Beach (10th row center) and both were experiences I'll never forget.  Now, I have it on DVD for eternity.

The extras are fantastic, including in room rehearsals, pre show soundchecks (gotta love hearing ""The Oath"" and ""Mr. Speed"").  The KISS Powervision is fantastic, so you can really follow your fav member throughout those six songs.

First, the packaging is first class and second the powervision feature is excellent. Ace and Peter I hate to say this but your replacements are outstanding. Tom and Eric do not miss a beat.

2438281,4,B000BQYWZW,"Finally we not only get a full KISS concert but we also get some real classic tunes that are a absolute treat for diehards and the curious alike. The concert is fresh in respect of the new setlist editions, Gene spitting blood to Unholy and breathing fire to War Machine. Sound cannot be faulted....well for my untrained ears anyway. Crank this baby right up for total neigbourhood meltdown. Use the slick KISS power vision to zoom in on your fav KISS member. Seeing Eric going ape on the drums is another highlight. This concert reinforces the bands decision to move forward with Eric and Tommy. Oh those blistering lead guitar solos. Vision is awesome with none of the overdone chopping and changing of the Symphony release. One lowlight for me was the chest pounding pro war rant before God Gave, more like a republican rally then a feel good rock concert. Surely the biggest mistake this band has made since their unfortunate cover ""And Then She Kissed Me"" Overall though this DVD release is without doubt the best ever released by KISS. They have never sounded tighter and have even surpassed their own sky high standards on live performance. Don't miss this spectacle.",1134432000,2,1174,4.788177339901478
2438292,5,B000BQYWZW,"As usual, the ornery and whiny KISS fans seem to get the most attention. For them, anything KISS does anymore is cause for derision and lamentation. The sad fact of the matter is that it's not too difficult to understand these are the same people that cry and moan about everything, not just KISS. `The potatoes are too lumpy; you're driving too slow; it's too hot . . .', on and on, ad infinitum; these people are never satisfied, and bashing KISS is just one of the myriad ways in which they showcase to the world what unhappy campers they are. So it goes.

KISS' ""Rock the Nation"" Tour was the best tour the band had since the Reunion. Add to that fact that this current lineup (Paul Stanley, Gene Simmons, Eric Singer, and Tommy Thayer) is the best and most tight lineup in the band's storied history. Yes, the original cast will always be ""classic"" KISS; of that there is no debate. But the fact is the original members do not have the same chemistry in 2005 as they did in 1975. KISS needed to move one, and replacing the two band members that weren't pulling their weight (Peter and Ace) was the logical and right thing to do.

Tommy and Eric provide KISS with the unique opportunity to once again dig into the archives and pull out some rarely-played gems, such as ""Parasite"", ""Tears are Falling"", and ""Got to Choose."" If you were a KISS fan even in those lowly days of the early nineties, would you have ever imagined you'd get the opportunity to see these songs played in make-up?

The ""Rock the Nation"" tour was a success because it managed to combine the classics with the rare songs that the die-hard KISS fan has always longed to hear in concert. KISS with Peter and Ace simply could not manage such a thing; it took the addition of Eric and Tommy to flesh out the powerful lineup that is showcased on this DVD.

 If you had the great fortune of being able to attend a concert on the ""Rock the Nation"" tour then you'll want this DVD as a keepsake. If you were not able to attend a show on the tour, then you need to purchase this to see what a viable and strong lineup KISS has put together today.

To all you naysayers out there, remember this: KISS can continue to play the `old stuff' because that old stuff stands the test of time. There was no music like KISS music in the `70's. Was most of it simple? Yes. But why is that always a negative? Fist-pounding and foot-tapping rock-n-roll just doesn't happen, it's created; and no one created better music for the rock genre in the 1970's than KISS.

Will I pay money to see KISS in concert again, for the 18th time? YES! Will I shell out hard-earned money to buy this DVD? Yes! A band that totally reshapes the rock scene to the level KISS has does not come around that often. Enjoy the magic that is KISS while you still can.

We want the best, they give us best. Enjoy this gift called ""KISS"" as long as you can; someday it will all be over.

 To the infamous naysayers, move on and find another band to lament over. KISS was never about you, that's why you never really did, and still don't, get it.",1134172800,10,3069,4.331010452961673

2438294,5,B000BQYWZW,"Hi there!

I had the fortune to see the last concert of the Rock the Nation Tour in Mexico City. Man... it was awesome. Maybe better than Reunion Tour... and definitely much better than Psycho Circus Tour. Yes, I have to admit it... I missed Ace a lot (but not Peter, sorry). Although Tommy Thayer is a great guitar player, I think he hasn't the personality enough to get into a stage. Tommy kick ass, but Ace is God. Tommy plays great, but Ace can do it much better (simply Ace could make me shiver and shake when he stared at my eyes on Psycho Tour in 1999, and Tommy couldn't impact me although he really plays good).

Well, I don't care what other people thinks about another compilation. This concert was really great. I expected the same songs sung on Reunion and Psycho Tour, but I was really surprised when they sang songs like Makin' Love, War Machine, God Gave Rock & Roll To You, Christine Sixteen, Lick It Up among others never performed in many many years.

Believe, this concert was great. The best?... maybe Eric Singer. You have to buy this DVD. Even without Ace, it worths. ROCK ON !!!",1133913600,,1102,4.41871921182266

I am so sick of another ""Greatest Hits"" type cds they have been putting out....they are doing nothing but living off of their past.  If this is the ""new"" kiss, as quoted from Paul Stanley, how about getting new costumes/outfits for Tommy and Eric.  Leave Peter's and Ace's original make up alone as for when Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent did.....Gene has done nothing but embarressed himself with his solo album and I'm pretty sure Paul will too.  Please KISS, give us, the fans, what we really want...THE REAL KISS!!  A new studio album.....Kiss is two members away from being another tribute band.....I'm sorry.",1133568000,12,715,4.590551181102362
2438297,3,B000BQYWZW,"All I see here is 2 sides of KISS fans yelling at one another. I must say I do love KISS old and new and thats all there is to it.

Yes Ace and Peter were getting old and unexcited but I'm sure there were things we don't know that we just assume. (and you know what happens when you assume?) I give Peter props for going as long as he did. It was nice, but to put the make up on some one else was weak. And to say Ace and Pete were in it for the money, um, if Gene weren't in it for the money then he would have retired the make up and proceeded back to the no make up stage. Just another whiner complaining of another. Ok.

As for this DVD. It's KISS with 2 guys who play well but look ridiculous in the make up. I mean Tommy Thayer just made me put that dollar back in my wallet and not in Gene's. Just take off the make up and play the great songs we love.

Also how about some rare footage DVD's or Video comp DVD's that we haven't seen. I'm sick of the Ebay bootlegs and those thugs making money off KISS's vids. Put out the quality DVD's the fans want. Gene, there's money in it buddy! Lots of it.

I will buy this the day it comes out just like I buy all the new stuff KISS puts out.",1133481600,8,1190,3.786290322580645
2438298,5,B000BQYWZW,"Note about this DVD: If die hard Ace/Peter fans were as committed to their wives as they are to these two guys, divorce rates would fall overnight.  If your girlfriend/wife gets old and wrinkled, or she's only willing to do a small fraction of the bedroom repetoire you used to do, or she just can't perform well anymore- you'd have no problem with some younger more nimble and talented lady puttin' on her makeup and performing with you.  So why, oh why are people STILL sittin' around complaining about Ace and Peter being out of the band?

I'm a fan all the way through and have felt many of the same growing pains other fans have, but just as Gene wants an active direct deposit account, I want an active KISS.  The reunion/Psycho/farewell tours were more than enough time to revel in the original four again- and a pleasure it was to see it live (moreso in '96 than as it dragged on years later). We had a new (although misguided) album and got TONS of press and articles and even the Second Coming dvd/vid package to cover and commemorate these four once again.  Great.

Now you get to 2004 and Ace and Peter are once again tired of Gene and the whole routine.  At one point, Ace and Eric Singer played with G&P in makeup- the reviews (from mature-non bitter fans) were great.  Energy was up and they started changing up setlists like a living breathing band might do.

Then for the second Alive 4 (remember the planned first non-syphony alive 4 due out years ago? see end of box set for a few cuts) Tommy played Ace and Peter played plain boring fills.  I had to boycott that DVD because the audio cd was so disappointing.  Half the arrangements didn't compliment the tunes at all and the few perks (shandi, sure know something) were overshadowed by the weirdness of Tommy/Peter combo mixed with a seated made up kiss for an acoustic set- just didn't feel right, but I digress.

The point is, Kiss is either make up or not, and additionally, original 4 or not.  Paying customers have made it clear- make up over non makeup- done.  However, if Ace and Peter can't or won't make the experience special anymore, let it be.  The rock the nation tour was undeniably akward for any true kiss fan, like calling your step-mom Mommy at Christmas dinner...it just felt weird, but you know what?  For all the akwardness, she cooks one hell of a dinner and makes dishes your real mom haven't been able to or willing to make in years so have another drink and sing along, sourpuss.

Gene will never care what any of us think, so stop requesting another reunion.  You had one- a big one- for years and, forgive the pun, it Petered out.  Aced out, too.  I love it for what it was worth, but it's done.  Be glad you got you Second Coming and half-decade of original Kiss together again and stop whining.

Additionally, Rock the Nation dvd showcases a tour where Kiss actually put some new production value into the show.  Not that the so called 3-D Psycho Circus Tour (what a joke) wasn't a good attempt, but for this tour, Kiss seemed to take a cue from Rush and/or Madonna who both round out their shows beautifully with tons of colorful video/graphics and animation.  Add this to  the energy, enthusiasm and setlist surprises of this tour and it's bound to please fans of Kiss' music and legacy- not roster.

Finally, this speculative reviewer of the not-yet available dvd can only hope that this incarnation of kiss does a new album together and tours fresh.  If you ease up enough to see what a blessing this could be, it might actually excite you.  Just think of it: the best of Kiss' live (make up) theatricality and production value mixed with musicianship that can deliver tunes from Love Her All I Can to Unholy.  It's the best that Kiss as a band, in any lineup, could offer.

A special note to you die hards who are so bitter you're still posting line-up related threads in the form of DVD reviews:  The rest of us had to drink enough so that Ace and Peter's new millenium playing was passable; now it's your turn to booze up enough to enjoy your favorite dinner made by newer-younger step-mommy in mom's old apron.  I'm not saying it wasn't lame for Eric and Tommy and don Ace and Peter's makeup, but the Rock the Nation tour gave me more of what I loved about Kiss over the years than any other tour since the Reunion.  Just some thoughts, folks...peace.",1133481600,16,4359,4.484157160963244

2438300,1,B000BQYWZW,"as a long time kiss fan, 30 years i can honestly give the average shopper looking for a good kiss dvd a HONEST REVIEW !!

i first saw kiss in 77 and many times since including 12 times from 96 to 01. many times in the first 5 rows. the makeup version of kiss is and always will be gene,peter, paul, and ace.  to make a long story short, ace and peter left kiss much to the sadness of the fans in 1980 as the band was turning into less of a band and more as stanley was qoueted as saying "" a circus side show"" where kids and moms and dads would go see the circus and buy many kiss toys. gene and paul carried on with the band thru the 80's and 90's without the makeup. than in 96 with money at a all time low gene and paul decided to get ace and peter back and put the makeup back on much to the happiness of the loyal fans. with sold out shows all around the world and cover photos on spin and playboy ( first time ever a band was put on the cover of playboy ) it seemed kiss was on top of the world again. but simmons was on a control kick again like in the 70's with simmons more interested in putting out toys than making music the envitable was happening again. when it was time to put out a album with the four orginals, gene refused to let ace and peter contribute, even though gene lied to the fans and said ace and peter were on the album . their songs were flat out refused even though it was peter who gave them their most popular song ever "" beth "" . as frustations grew in the band ace and peter left again. but not before simmons advertized their last tour together as "" the last time to see kiss in makeup"" to try to rally up ticket sales. simmons and stanley were quoted numerous times as saying "" its better to go out while people are asking us why"" than people saying ""why don't you just retire ""  this was all of course a gimmick to sell more tickets with ace and peter in the band. as the tour winded down, simmons and stanley were already asking a long time roadie "" tommy thayer"" and a session player "" eric singer"" if they wanted to join the band and they would dress them up as ace and peter. most loyal fans were insulted! (think rolling stones dressing up somebody else to look like keith richards) think the circus without the elephants  . simmons and stanley went on tour in 03, in makeup with the 2 scabs and the fans anwsered by not showing up.. USA TODAY called the tour that this dvd was filmed "" one of the top ten flops of the summer"" with all time low ticket sales, this was not the makeup kiss that people wanted. in europe, promoters would not even book this version of kiss and they never toured there. simmons and stanley should have kept to their word and retired the makeup kiss and mabey toured like the 80's , without the makeup. simmons also released a solo album in 04 and it flopped, barely moving 4,000 copies the first week.

  i did see them in sommerset wi in 03 on this tour and was very disappointed. i'm sure this dvd will have a dubbed in audience. if you really want to see what the makeup kiss was all about in the 70's and in 96 go buy the ""second comming"" dvd !! it speaks for itself and proves there is no makeup kiss without ace and peter. or better yet wait for simmons and stanley to start releasing concerts from the 70's...",1133308800,7,3286,4.061728395061729

2438312,5,B000BQYWZW,"There is no doubt that the original KISS lineup was one of a kind, not only did the manage to rule the world TWICE, but they also changed Rock and Roll forever, despite what many ""important people"" think, but it only worked when the 4 of them were willing to give 100%, proof of that is that KISS almost destroyed themselves when they lost focus at the end of their first reign, the solo albums marked the beginning of it, when Peter left, even replacing him with an EXCELLENT drummer (God bless you Eric Carr), didn't worked out, because now Ace was having personal problems, not longer commited to the band, and leaving eventually, the band was still a wreck with 2 replacementes,until they finally found someone willing to give it all, the Gene, Paul, Eric and Bruce Kulick line up proved successful because it was a complete band, it shows on those great concerts with out makeup, KISS survived for another decade, with a tragic loss and low sales, but with 4 commited people (Eric Singer joined After Eric's passing).

Then on 1996, the KISS Army's greatest dream came true, the magnificent 4 returned TOGETHER, for a second reign, I was three times on that tour, YES, Ace Frehley, my favorite member no longer played the same, but he was giving 100%, performing as great as the other 3 guys, and I have always believed this to be what KISS is all about, half quoting Mr. STANLEY ""It is great when they are ALL great, and it sucks when ONE isn't"", this applies to the current line up, I rather see Ace happy and doing his own thing, than seeing him on a crappy ""farewell"" tour, 2000 wasn't a good year for Ace, remember the 2003 Aerosmith-KISS tour, there wAs no commitment there, NO good, I Assited to 3 shows on last years Rock the Nation Tour.

2438313,3,B000BQYWZW,"no matter who is in kiss they still stick to what made them. a great live show. it didn't matter who was or is in kiss as long as they still have gene and paul. they are the heart of the band, gene for his love of money and paul because he loves kiss and rock-n-roll.i as a long time fan look forward to this release, as long as it looks, sounds, and feels like kiss. long live the gods of thunder!!",1132185600,,399,3.8780487804878048
2438314,1,B000BQYWZW,"It is blasphemy to dress someone else in Ace and Peter costumes and pretend like we're supposed to roll with it.  Gene and Paul, you know better.  Just take off the make-up and keep calling it KISS like you used to.  Or give these guys the old Eric Carr chicken outfit and Vinny Vincent whatever that was, and people will be cool with it.  But I ain't buying this because I consider it disrespectful.",1132185600,7,400,4.364864864864865
2438315,4,B000BQYWZW,"I like the original band as much as everyone else. But lets face it, Peter cant play drums anymore & Ace cant play his guitar that great anymore. Eric and Tommy are so much better. I've seen  both shows with ace & Peter and with Eric & Tommy. Eric and Tommy win hands down. Although I agree they should cut some new music. As for the makeup, who cares. Leave it on, take it off. Dosen't matter to me. I am in it for the songs (Gasp). Yes it's true, I like KISS for the music.",1132099200,2,475,3.9479166666666665
2438316,1,B000BQYWZW,"Get Ace and Peter back, and get rid of those two clowns that are wearing there make up, and you will have a real KISS dvd. Enough said!!",1132012800,7,136,3.892857142857143
2438317,1,B000BQYWZW,"The DVD is not even out but fans are giving 5 stars just because they like the band. Since I don't like the band anymore, I guess that gives me the right to do just the opposite. I'll give it one star. Ace Frehley rules!!!",1132012800,9,222,3.9555555555555557
2438318,5,B000BQYWZW,"first of all i give this dvd a rating of 5 because i was at both gigs in the dvd and they both rocked this will be a great dvd

now as far as eric and tommy are in the band while this is a tremendouys line up two things should have happend 1.give them there own make-up-2.record some new tracks a decent amount.it did not seem right seeing eric as the catman or tommy ( former road manager) as the space ace, but it was over all one of the best kiss shows i've been two since spycho circus",1131926400,3,489,3.89
2438319,5,B000BQYWZW,"For starters, learn to spell ridiculous correctly.  That may give you more credibility or explain why you only rate it a 1.  I think it's safe to say that anyone who saw the concerts certainly has the right to give it a rating.  I've seen several concerts and the DVD's have yet to let me down.  If you're a KISS fan, you can certainly understand the ratings of a 5.  The band is better now with Tommy and Eric and the concert was awesome.  Plus, you get extra footage that you won't get at a concert.  Five is easy.",1131667200,3,516,4.151515151515151
2438320,5,B000BQYWZW,"You criticize us for giving it five stars for lovin' the band?

How about you all, that gave the DVD ONE star for no reason what so ever.

If you have a problem with us giving good ratings, then your lone star was really directed at us, not the DVD!",1131580800,2,249,3.96
2438321,1,B000BQYWZW,"Agree with the latest 2 reviews. Let's stop giving 5 stars to everything just because you like the band! What if this DVD sucks, the sound quality is poor, etc?! There are DVDs from bands that I just love that are terrible, and I gave them 1 or 2 stars!

A tip for those who look at the reviews before buying, read only the bad reviews, with 1 or 2 stars. Those are the good ones to understand what is not good on a product and see if those bad things make you give up buying it. 5 stars reviews are always ""this band rocks"" ""I love her.."" and that kind of s***",1131580800,12,561,3.9646017699115044
8091201,3,B000BQYWZW,"The video quality and camera work in this DVD are excellent, but listening to this in Dolby 5.1 with the volume turned up was very difficult.  Specifically, there is very little ""bottom end"" to this, e.g. Gene Simmons' bass and more of the kick drum providing the ""meat/potatoes"" under the music. There were times I had trouble hearing the separation in the music between Tommy Thayer's and Paul Stanley's solos.  Frankly, I had to turn it down and have not had to do that with concert DVDs from other bands.  I also found that Paul Stanley had difficulty in sustaining some of the higher vocals.

Overall, I enjoyed it but found it to be a little disappointing in the above respect.",1517097600,,683,4.619834710743802

8091209,4,B000BQYWZW,"Kiss is and will be forever one of the greatest live shows ever. It's because they are kiss ,  and that means a persona of music in a sense. This dvd features great kiss songs but the editing is hard and fast. Which is much like u2 live 360.  I am not a big fan of that type of live concert film but in spite of that this is still worth owning for the good tunes on here.  the kissology sets are much better as they don't edit things in that way. But his one still will get you going. The footage is from the 00's so it's very clear as well.",1400198400,,541,3.8125
8091210,5,B000BQYWZW,"I use to think KISS isn't the same without Ace Frehley and Peter Criss, but the concert in this DVD is thoroughly enjoyable even though Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer are the guitarist and drummer. I am not a die-hard KISS fan so I obviously can't hear what Ace and Peter contributed, whether it differs from Tommy and Eric. All the KISS songs sound like KISS classics. KISS is KISS, for its music and makeup. And this concert video is great for showcasing this, their classic showmanship and rock and roll.",1393372800,2,505,4.56043956043956
