8269942,3,B0018L63XS,"This 'propaganda documentary' is an excellent example in that genre, BUT THIS IS NOT Cuba in the late 50s! It is a politically motivated re-construction and re-invention of Cuba in 1958. It was filmed in 1964, by a Russian master of black and white photography, and this aspect of the film makes it visually rewarding and even beautiful.
But be warned!, the content is pure propaganda for Castro's tale of what happened. The politics of the film are NAIVE and never beyond the depth of a political pamphlet.
It was filmed in 1963-64, in a Havana already in the grip of Castro and his Russian allies. The ""American"" tourists in the film are in reality Russian and Eastern European actors from the Soviet-Bloc behind the Iron Curtain and the Berlin Wall. It is an almost funny construct, and a lesson in the art of cinematic fantasy and deception.",1214956800,,845,4.716216216216216
