8579651,5,B00CB8AILU,"I got this purely for 48 Hours and Trading Places, so Norbit was a bonus for me. Two of Eddie Murphy's best ever films.",1421107200,,119,4.0
8579652,5,B00CB8AILU,I rate cause I like Eddie Murphy. I watched all 3 triple feature movies On this blu-ray disc. Trading Places and Norbit come with special features. And 48 H.R.S. only comes with a trailer. No problem with any of these movies. I would recommend this to a friend or family member.,1420243200,2,278,4.470588235294118
