8588598,4,B00D2L8PW4,"I first discovered British comedienne/singer/dancer Jessie Matthews when I watched - and favorably reviewed - the 1930s film ""What a Girl!"" (the film that inspired Blake Edward's film - and later Broadway hit ""Victor/Victoria""). Matthews was a delight and I wanted to see more of her films. But a search showed that only one other film was available in the US and she made a bunch of them. What great news when I learned the independent DVD reissue label, VCI, was going to release FOUR of her films this month - and more later in the year - for a total of 10!  This is the second one I have watched - others are coming - so I'm only basing my review on this film.

Though Matthews  is a singer and dancer as well as a comedienne (she performs all these roles in WAG and TGC) for this brief 77-minute film from 1932 she only does comedy - with the exception of 30 seconds when she dances to a gramophone in a park.  The plot is one of telling a little lie and watching it grow. It's a cute film though obviously not Matthew's best. She does wear some pre-code negligees that show off her figure.

The film was made in 1932 is the early days of sound films. VCI says upfront that the film was ""restored"". The sound however is a bit rough - especially in the beginning (and even worse when the ""Menu"" appears). It's possible that this is the best copy they had to work with. (A credit at the end shows the commercial British network ITV, so that may be the source. But VCI at least comes to the rescue by providing English subtitles - in VERY easy to read yellow typeface which is of a readable size. (I wish more companies would use yellow instead of white for subtitles). (Note that the package says the film came from ITV so maybe they created the subtitles. Anyway, I'm glad they are there.)

There are no bonuses here except a short ad for other titles coming from VCI and a ""scene index"". No, this is not as much fun as ""First A Girl""  - or even ""The Good Companions"" (see my review) but it's entertaining DVD and VCI deserves credit for taking a chance on getting the rights to make it available in the US.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
