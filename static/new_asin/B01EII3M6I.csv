7735164,5,B01EII3M6I,"If you are from South Central Pennsylvania, this story is at least a little familiar to you.  Shane Free has done an amazing job of meeting with surviving family members and others who have a connection to the incident of 1928.  The story is beautifully told through the memories and interviews from those who were there and those who were closest to the families involved.  The story itself is intense and captivating, and pieced together with the beautiful and haunting music and the lonely setting of the Hollow, this is a documentary unlike anything I've seen before.  I love the adherence to historical facts versus modern urban legends and I love that he tackled the story from all angles...interviewing family, friends, and experts in the field of powwowing and folklore.  If you love the Pennsylvania Germans and are as fascinated by witchcraft and Powwowing as I am, then this is a must see!",1461974400,2,900,4.856209150326797

7735167,5,B01EII3M6I,"I grew up about 8 miles or so from where this took place, and I can remember sitting at my great-grandmothers feet listening to her tell the story. It's about time this story was presented to the world accurately, and takes away the mysteries of ""Pow-Wow;"" until you're left with real people, families and a community affected by this tragedy.",1464566400,,343,4.733333333333333

7735170,5,B01EII3M6I,Informative and interesting even to a local who knew about the history. If your in the area and they hold the tours of the homestead in the future it's also well worth the Tim and money.,1464134400,,186,4.194444444444445
7735171,5,B01EII3M6I,"This is a story that have been familiar with for years, so I was excited when I heard this was coming out, and I pre-ordered.

7735173,5,B01EII3M6I,"Loved it!  Puts things into perspective.  Seeing how fear and ignorance can cause so much damage not only at the time, but the ripple that it makes through out history.  Christopher Bilardi did an exceptional job at shedding a light on the whole story.  It needed to be told.  Only by factual documentation of the whole truth are we able to see the rational and fear that caused such an hysteria.",1463875200,,396,4.52112676056338
7735174,5,B01EII3M6I,"Loved, loved, loved this !!! I was born and raised in this area, and all my life have heard second hand stories of the events that transpired in the ""Hollow"". This film tells the real story straight from the friends and family of these two men. The documentary is very well done from start to finish. I loved every minute of it.",1462924800,,328,4.306451612903226
7735175,1,B01EII3M6I,I was really disappointed as the movie never tells you what actually happened.  It is all background information about the people involved and almost nothing about the actual event!,1462147200,3,181,5.241379310344827

8758760,5,B01EII3M6I,"I was very impressed with this documentary about the Nelson Rehmeyer murder. The story is told by the relatives and other people who knew the major players of this story. Besides the cinematography, I would also impressed with the music and art that went along with the film. Definitely recommended for anybody who studies or practice pow-wow, or anybody else who want to watch a well made film of a famous murder and trial.",1484697600,,424,4.743243243243243

8758765,4,B01EII3M6I,Interesting movie about PowWowing. Definitely did further research after watching the movie.,1469577600,,92,6.75
8758766,5,B01EII3M6I,"Very interesting movie. We live in the area, so we found it very interesting. They had interviews with current relatives and neighbors of the past people that were involved with the murder and witchcraft, including people that are still using this ""witchcraft"" to this day. It was very interesting to learn about this religion. We were glad we watched it and learned some new things we didn't know anything about. We highly recommend watching this video.",1468972800,2,454,4.9868421052631575
