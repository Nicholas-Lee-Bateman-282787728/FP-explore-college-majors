8206977,5,B000SUKPQ6,Love this show.  The situations are funny. No one seems to take themselves too seriously and there are no sanctimonious characters on this show like so many others.,1354838400,,164,4.857142857142857
8206978,5,B000SUKPQ6,"We finished watching season two of 30 Rock feeling that the writers strike had put a damper on the quality of the final five episodes (pretty much all of disc two), and as Tina Fey explains, those episodes are missing out on the improvised dialogue that ordinarily spikes up every episode.  Seems the actors didn't want to add even the slightest little thing, in solidarity with the striking scripters.  So the last five episodes are a bit stiff and awkward, and on top of that the season arc had to be hastily erected and concluded in a much shorter number of episodes than it had been launched to last.  Oh well, it's fine, but I'm just saying, the quality suffers a little because you're used to the Rolls Royce of shows, then suddenly it's just a tricked-out hummer.  Shame because, in every other way, the season has seemed on the brink of topping season one with ease.  The actors all seem much more comfortable with their roles, and Alec Baldwin is now in his own grand world of genius, in which he can say or do the craziest things and they all make sense.  Tina herself as Liz Lemon must have rebelled against the way her stylists had gradually made her more and more chic during the finals episodes of season one, so she had become indistinguishable from the leading ladies of ordinary shows.  Remember when that happened to Roseanne and all of a sudden Roseanne looked like Bruce Weber was photographing her for Vogue?  When Liz was dating Lloyd it was the same sort of thing.

Now all that's changed and she is the hapless mess we adore, and she sticks with it, though watching her on season three's opener last night (when she is trying to adopt a baby from gruff, sadistic Megan Mullally) she had put herself all together and I was thinking, uh-oh, she's all glamorous again, but by the end of the episode things had fallen apart.

I don't know, but I'm sort of tired of Kenneth and would rather see more of Jonathan, but Jonathan himself is becoming much more like Lloyd--the other Lloyd, the one on Entourage.  It's like writers in general think there's only two ways for male PA's to be, and neither of them are pretty.  We didn't like it in the movies when Meryl Streep was so outrageously nasty to her assistants in The Devil Wears Prada, but on TV, and when it's a man who's doing it, it's all so super comical, but it sets my remaining teeth on edge.",1225411200,,2371,4.475638051044084
8206979,5,B000SUKPQ6,"I love this show, It has intelligent raunchy humor.  I agree with a previous review that says you need to on a higher level to get some of the jokes but there is something for everyone.  If you like shows like Scrubs, Sanford and Son, Seinfield, Dave Chapelle and Family Guy, then you will like this, it's all those shows mixed together. No one is safe Black, White or in between... I love it.. p.s staff nicknamed the show ""Dirty Rock"" lol...",1201651200,,443,4.390243902439025
8206980,4,B000SUKPQ6,"30 Rock succesfully makes fun of: Saturday Night Live, NBC, parent company GE, entertainment programing executives, black comedians, white comedians, geeks, rednecks, city slickers, women, men, you name it, 30 Rock fries everyone with blatant toilet humor to comedy so sophisticated you have to be an English major to figure it out. There are belly laughs and slow sleeper jokes that take the whole show to develop.
The show is a spoof, within a spoof, within a spoof. Take a look at the epsisode where they make fun of advertising and product placement in TV shows,its laser humor of the first degree toasting NBC, GE, Snapple AND the shows writers all in one great scene.
There is nothing funnier or more smart and dumb at the same time then 30 Rock. A good buy as you will want to re-watch episodes to catch all the jokes",1191283200,2,824,4.6506849315068495
8206981,1,B000SUKPQ6,I have no idea why they split this up into two volumes.  Volume 2 is only one disc that has like 5 episodes on it.  They have a complete season 1 package that is cheaper than buying these two separate.,1188950400,40,201,4.0
