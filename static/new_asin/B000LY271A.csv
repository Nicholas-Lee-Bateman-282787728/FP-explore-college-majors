2717951,4,B000LY271A,"This is the first time I have ever found a semi-complete version of the Pearl White series.

From a historical point of view it is fascinating. Probably the first time an independant woman was put on the screen. Of course the fella has to frequently get her out of a jam but she is always a game girl. The acting is what you would expect for the period. A bit over the top many times. There are missing chapters, how many I couldn't say. Nevertheless, sense can be made...well most times, of the continuity and scenario.

I give it four stars because it is the most complete 1914 version I have ever come across. The missing chapters reduce it to four stars and some of the print leaves something to be desired. But I doubt if anything better of this original Cliffhanger is around.",1218153600,25,782,4.423611111111111

8165357,5,B000LY271A,"""The Perils of Pauline"" starring Pearl White was released in 1914 in 20 episodes.  While a true ""classic"" of its kind, it differs from the later serials in that most episodes resolve at the end, with a ""continuing story"" linking the episodes.  It was created as publicity for the Hearst newspaper chain, which published Pauline's adventures as the episodes were screened.  The writing, acting and directing may be a little lacking, even for 1914, and while it was not the first, it has become the most famous of the early serials for its perilous stunts, most done by the actors themselves.

Pauline (Pearl White) has been putting off marrying her fiance, Harry Marvin (Crane Wilbur), wanting to first spend time experiencing adventures.  Harry's father, Sanford Marvin (Edward Jose) is Pauline's guardian, but is ill and dies, leaving Pauline and her inheritance under the protection of his trusted secretary, Kroener (Paul Panzer) until she marries.  But Kroener is actually an escaped convict, and makes use of Pauline's desire for adventure, encouraging her into situations in which fatal ""accidents"" can be arranged so he can get her inheritance.  Each episode involves one or more of these attempts, some of which are fairly clever, others less so.

Of the original 20 episodes all that remains is a recut version in nine episodes, released in Europe in 1916, which has survived because it was issued for film libraries on safety-base 28mm prints, a popular format before the mid-1920s.  By that time the original English intertitles were lost.  Retranslated from French, the replacement English titles have some dreadful if often hilarious errors in spelling, syntax and wording.  Some of these nine episodes appear to have been made from more than one of the original 20, and episode four, titled ""The Deadly Turning"" is said to be missing the first reel, yet the story seems complete.

Grapevine's edition (currently ASIN: B007I6J3FM) is on two DVD-R discs, and while the image quality cannot be described as good, the problems are from the source, as can be seen from the much cleaner look of the titles from the prints, when they are used.  All nine surviving episodes are present, the first one being the longest, about 35 minutes, which includes the famous sequence with the runaway balloon.  On this, and several other episodes Grapevine has replaced the intertitles other text such as written notes with new titles, a poor match for the film but those in the source print were probably in French.  Fortunately, the English titles with the most hilarious of the mistranslations are present from the print in the second episode, ""Goddess of the Far West.""  The image has been tinted, something often done in the silent era, and if maybe a little extreme, easy enough to tame with the color saturation control on the TV.  The musical accompaniment uses old recordings familiar from other releases of silent films, and while the audio quality is afflicted with ""whistle"" likely from a low sample rate digital source, the music is supportive of the action, and even includes a couple ""explosion"" sound effects.  In all a fine edition of the serial.

Alpha's so-called ""Feature Version,"" their number ALP-7627D (ASIN: B00VV4BXIC), is on a single DVD-R.  It has the first episode, plus much of the last one, abruptly spliced on with neither break nor DVD index mark.  Only about 50 minutes of the serial, but it is still of interest, in that it has a couple messages delivered to Mr. Marvin, cut in Grapevine's edition, and at least some of the intertitles from the 28mm print, in English, if some of the lettering gets cropped in Alpha's source print.  The framing is bad enough that in the first scene when Mr. Marvin is reading letters, they and Koerner are off-screen to the left.  No tinting was used, fully revealing that the opening is faded and scratchy, but the image suddenly improves after a couple minutes.  I like Alpha's version of this episode because it is closer to the original, though the music track starts out with almost random selections.  Eventually it changes to something similar to what Grapevine used, possibly taken from a source with a soundtrack.  As for the last episode, it runs about 14 minutes, about five minutes shorter than Grapevine's, with many small pieces missing.  Grapevine's is not only more complete, but a lot sharper, and this episode has not only the ""original"" intertitles but also the main episode title from the print, though with the same ""recreated"" ones for cast and production used with the other episodes.  The Alpha DVD has an additional item, not related to the serial, a Mack Sennett comedy from 1912, ""Katchem Kate"" with Mabel Normand.  It runs about 10 minutes, and was probably included to bring the total disc content up to an hour.  From the ""The End"" title it appears to have been from the same film source as the ""feature version"" of the serial.

For most purposes, the Grapevine edition is preferable, and that is the one I give the 5-star ""I Love It"" rating.  Alpha's is not as bad as I expected, and useful for the authenticity of the first episode, though it is hardly a coherent ""feature"" as such, and the indexing makes it less useful than it could be.",1498521600,3,5233,4.884615384615385
8165358,1,B000LY271A,"I have enjoyed silent films from Harold Lloyd, Charlie Chaplain, Buster Keaton, Mary Pickford, and Laurel & Hardy. In good silent films; you know what is happening, and the pace moves along briskly; everything is story or gags; without any wasted time or lulls. The only good thing about ""The Perils of Pauline"" is the title. The Pauline film moves very very slowly; painfully slow. Pauline is never tied to a railroad track in this film. There are only two perils and they are NOT presented as a cliffhanger, and are not creative. The film uses a lot of written frames to explain the story, rather than action. The film does NOT tell an interesting story. There is a lot of standing around. There are no interesting characters or character acting. The villain has no personality. Pauline has no personality. The picture quality is very poor for being so old. Any of the reviews over 1-star must be shill reviews by the sellers. This film is NOT what you expect from the positive reviews.",1478304000,,988,4.683908045977011

8165363,5,B000LY271A,"THE PERILS OF PAULINE, released in 1914, is held as the most influential suspense serial in cinema history. It's really the first one that had an impact on audiences worldwide, making ""cliffhangers"" the most popular form of screen entertainment throughout the WW1 period.

Starring pretty, athletic Pearl White as Pauline, the plot follows her daring exploits in evading her guardian's (Paul Panzer) attempts to kill her in order to secure her inherited fortune for himself. Coming to Pauline's rescue in the nick of time is her fiancee (Crane Wilbur).

  This historic film is enjoyable for several reasons. For one thing, the action scenes involved some very real danger since this was in the era before process photography, so the actors were required to perform many of their own stunts. This gives the thrill aspects of PERILS OF PAULINE an authenticity that's impressive to this day. Also, White's Pauline is the movies' very first independent woman; besides being brave, she seeks adventure for the sheer fun of it, much to the displeasure of her boyfriend who has no effect in dissuading her. Each chapter has its own resolution, so they can stand alone as little stories as well as setups for the next installment. Additionally, the film is a valuable cultural and social record of the time period.

Grapevine's DVD (this isn't a DVD-R)  of PAULINE is the best version available having been transferred off the only surviving element, that being a 28mm European print that's been edited down from 20 chapters to 9. The image quality is quite good, considering the age of the source, with appropriate tinting for certain scenes. Of particular note is the frantic musical score, which sounds like it's from a stock library of compositions used to underscore many silent films.

Highly recommended.",1334534400,13,1804,5.053872053872054

8165365,4,B000LY271A,"This is a review of Grapevine Video's THE PERILS OF PAULINE, the famous
1914 serial starring Pearl White as Pauline,  Crane Wilbur as her fiance Harry  Marvin and Paul Panzer as Koerner. This serial ws the groundbreaking cliffhanger
prototype that was as popular as any feature film and kept the customers coming back week after week. I rate this DVD release 4 1/2 stars out of five. Originally there were 20 chapters but this Grapevine Video edition is the European release, edited down to nine chapters, 3 hours and 19 minutes worth.

This version is more than adequate, in fact it's quite good. Making allowances for the fact that this film is almost 100 years old. Grapevine Video has done a fine job adding appropriate music and the picture quality is pretty decent for the most part.

I thought just to give the reader some idea of the content of this serial I'd list the titles of the nine chapters:

1) Trial By Fire.
2) Goddess of the Far West.
3) The Pirate Treasure.
4) The Deadly Turning.
5) A Watery Doom.
6) The Shattered Plan.
7) The Tragic Plunge.
8) The Serpent In the Flowers.
9) The Floating Coffin.

As you may have noticed most of Pauline's perils involve some sort of natural danger such as water, fire, etc.  Also our heroine loves to perform daredevil stunts, givng
the villians a great opportunity to mask thier nefarious plans as accidents.

In any event, this DVD of THE PERILS OF PAULINE is likely to be the absolute best
copy you'll get of this groundbreaking serial.  I'd like to publicly thank Grapevine Video for the wonderful job they have done on this notable DVD release.",1263513600,28,1606,4.626760563380282
