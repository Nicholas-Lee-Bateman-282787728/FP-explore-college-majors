8441856,5,B004UNFRZG,"Aside from the bad (but passable) English, this video is great.  Caio Terra puts together a fairly comprehensive look at the half guard position and its various iterations (Deep Half, 50/50, etc.) and does so in a digestible way with progressions (if this move doesn't work, then do this).  I'm already hitting a lot of his sweeps/finishes after a couple of views.",1487980800,,364,4.854838709677419
8441857,4,B004UNFRZG,"The Good:

Caio Terra is an excellent teacher and he really tries hard to make sure that you know what the essential details are. All of the techniques flow well together and it is very clear how to use each position.

The Bad:
The quality of the DVD is a little suspect. All three of the DVDs my computer has a hard time reading and will periodically stop so that I have to eject them and start over which is really annoying.

The Camera work is not very good and sometimes Caio will be positioned in a way that you won't be able to see the essential details that he is talking about because his partner's body is blocking the move. You can however figure it out since they later do different camera angles on Caio performing the move without instruction. However, its a technical problem that doesn't show up for example in the Gracie Combatives DVDs where they are constantly changing positioning to show the important parts of the moves.

Overview:
It's production problems aside, he DVD set is essential for smaller guys like myself who are constantly getting smashed in half guard. The techniques are by no means basic however. You could certainly develop a mostly complete game based just on this set but at the end of the day, this set is at its core a technical manual on a really good half-guard. That means if you don't have your fundamentals down and a good amount of mat time, this dvd set is going to be really dry to watch.",1366934400,2,1438,4.4562737642585555
8441858,5,B004UNFRZG,"This is by far the best instruccional I've owned.
I bought this because bottom half guard was my worst position so I wanted to round up my game improving it a little , but the results surpased my expectation , while I just wanted to be able to hold up myself while in the position I ended up havind a pretty solid half guard game while it still not my best position I think that it can become that.
Caio explains things perfectly and everything is packed really nicely , I recomend this a 100 percent",1309996800,4,500,4.21875
