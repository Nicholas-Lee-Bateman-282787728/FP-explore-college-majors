6878034,4,B00QSC3K1A,"If you are a fan of the ""Ghost in the Shell"" series, you should enjoy this episode (to include the ""Arise - Border"" series, actually). The only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars was that it was still subtitled in English, so it made the in-depth story/plot difficult to follow at times. Still an awesome experience.",1426809600,,325,4.52542372881356
6878035,5,B00QSC3K1A,English dub would be nice though,1425945600,,32,4.5
6878036,4,B00QSC3K1A,"I would have given it four stars if it had been dubbed in English. Like all the Ghost in the Shell stories it was intelligent, imaginative and thought provoking.",1425945600,,161,4.586206896551724
6878037,5,B00QSC3K1A,"It's pretty fast paced, and the point of view changes can be a bit confusing at first, but just like the rest of the Arise series, it's really fun to watch and keeps you involved.",1425945600,,179,4.142857142857143
6878038,4,B00QSC3K1A,Enjoyed this complicated scifi story; you must pay attention to the story or you will get lost. Amazing artwork in the anime.,1425168000,,125,4.7272727272727275
6878039,2,B00QSC3K1A,The animation and story was much less than the previous offerings.  Sad to see.,1425168000,,79,4.642857142857143

6878042,5,B00QSC3K1A,"I am a big fan of Oshii's film adaption of the GITS, and this is a good compliment.",1424304000,,83,3.6666666666666665
6878043,5,B00QSC3K1A,"(4/15) Edit* format/spelling
(4/15) Edit* 2 new OVAs announced (and I believe they are already showing in Japan). Its been broadcasted as one set (OVAs 1-6) and titled Ghost in the Shell Arise: Alternative Architechture. This is separate of another standalone pre-SAC film (title unknown), and also separate from the live action adaptation announcement.

With Border 4 concluding the Arise series, and providing lore for the pre-SAC era, I was hoping for a nice conclusion and and seg-way to the great TV show. And I can say I was pleased in that aspect. Considering there is now another film underway (and likely being a continuation from Arise) it provided great closure all the while redlining the viewer's political thriller tastes; welcome to GiTS!

The good-
For anyone that has been following the Arise series, you'll appreciate the story here; it has really been amped up (I had to watch it multiple times to grasp it, then another to enjoy the animation) compared to Border 1-3. Minus some technical flaws in story that don't match up to it's sequel show SAC (i.e. how Motoko and her team at Section 9 were really formed), you catch a glimpse of them truely bonding. It showed it was at least attempting to stay true to the franchise, and it was a great thing to see; it made me more appreciative of the director Kise's chioces for the series.

Now the bad-
The screenplay wasn't the best, and the animation was inconsistent. To me it just felt like the staff was rushing it, with Border 1 being excellent in those regards, and slowly going downhill from there. To me these were the only faults, unfortunately this equated to the majority of the visual aspect.
Oh and there there are a lot more recycled [with a spin] scenes from the original film, so be warned if that was distasteful to you. I know Kise and the rest of the staff have the skill, we've all seen it. I would not be surprised if the dip in quality was due to time/money/pressure issues.

Overall-
It's a great ending to the series, pretty decent film as a standalone and still worthy of bearing the GiTS name. This particular version costs a pretty penny, so I would recommend waiting for the Border 3-4 combo pack (it should also include the english dub!). This set is subtitles only, includes some routine on-disc extras and small artbook.",1420848000,12,2316,4.697044334975369
6878044,5,B00QSC3K1A,"I've loved this GIT's since it came out.  This is an excellent ""prequel"" to the original.  You will not be disappointed.",1466121600,,120,4.666666666666667

6878053,2,B00QSC3K1A,"This was disappointing to me. It just seemed like this one was thrown together. The other 3 in this series were fine, but this episode seemed disjointed, and then there was the 'holiday' background, apparently it was being released around Christmas time in the west. It didn't have the same feeling as the other 3. It was OK.",1438387200,,325,4.620689655172414

6878055,4,B00QSC3K1A,"Nice conclusion to the four part Arise series that's a prequel to the Ghost in the Shell tv show and movies. The action is awesome, great gunplay and future cyborg martial arts. Watch all four Arise borders (the Arise name for episode). Arise 4 is not the best out of the four Arise borders; compared to the first three, Arise 4 should have had more daring action scenes. The Arise series is surprising and fresh, it delivers the goods.",1435449600,,436,4.531645569620253

6878063,4,B00QSC3K1A,"The ""Arise"" prequel series might be considered mandatory viewing for people new to Ghost In The Shell: as it sets up the origins of Motoko's special Section 9 Team, and lays out the world in which the show operates. Border One was outstanding in this regard, and subsequent episodes in this series were very good. I found Border 4 to be very in-line with the GITS ""Stand-Alone Complex"" series, and that's both good and bad.  Of the four episodes in Arise, this one is the most obscure and hard to follow, for someone just starting out. It spends an inordinate amount of time musing about epistemological issues and The nature of the ""self"", (or ""ghost"") without being able to draw  firm conclusions. That discussion is made more opaque by natural translation barriers in subtitling to English. I think some of the nuance is lost, but you still ""get it"". It opens mysteries and conspiracies that are not all cleanly and comfortably solved by the end credits. If you like your stories neatly tied up in a bow, this will be slightly annoying; you may feel like you missed something and you'll go back several times to figure it out. If you've watched much of GITS, you'll think  this is an exact fit with the larger series and the manga.  The animation style seems a little more streamlined than the first episode, then again, they are also trying to depict an advancing timeline from the point of Episode 1.  Overall, a good one to watch, but the toughest of the 4 to follow. Which for fans of GITS, means they got it just about right:-)",1427500800,4,1535,4.587591240875913

8692553,4,B00QSC3K1A,As a stand alone episode it is very very good. I took away one star because as the series finally it failed to bring the overall arc to any kind of satisfactory conclusion.,1482105600,,172,4.242424242424242
