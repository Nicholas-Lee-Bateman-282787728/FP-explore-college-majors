5726340,1,B00CMCCAGQ,"We rented a DVD of this movie, taken in by the cover, which was labeled 'Action-Adventure'. It is a very slow movie with no battle scene(s)...as implied by the cover, only natural outdoor settings, a collection of rags and furs for costumes, and only brief glimpses of weapons or armor. There is no compelling character, either hero or villain. The precious ""book"", supposedly coveted for it's gold encrustations as well as the power it holds over the people, doesn't glow or shine or awe; it just looks ""brown"".  This was obviously a low budget film.  The most annoying thing, for me, is that it was like watching a slightly tinted black-and-white film. I thought there was something wrong with our DVD player! But no...except for a streak of blue warpaint on a face or a show of brownish blood, for example, you absolutely could not say what color ANYthing is in this film! They took the term Dark Ages quite literally. The film's ending is somewhat satisfying, but not worth the ""journey"" to get there.",1381708800,5,1005,4.7371428571428575

5726343,2,B00CMCCAGQ,"There is no battle.  There are some skirmishes, but there is definitely no one in this movie that looks like the cover of this movie, which is what drew me in.  There are a bunch of old dudes in skins, walking through the countryside, and there is a bit of drama, and a bit of suspense, but nothing like the picture on the front of this movie.

There are some elements that look like they might be fantastical or maybe a bit of romance, but neither of those things really pan out the way the audience might like, either.

If you are going for dialogue or a non-romantic view of what this era was like, then see it.",1375142400,13,614,4.177966101694915
5726344,2,B00CMCCAGQ,"This story takes place in Great Britain in 793 AD and is based on true events, or so it claims. The Vikings have landed on the island and begin to pirate and plunder. Their king is obsessed with locating the ""Holy Gospel of Lindisfarne."" It is a powerful book which protects the island and will give the Vikings great power when they find it, although it really hasn't been helping Northumberland too much of late. Hereward, a young monk is tasked with saving the book in delivering it to Iona.

The movie is consumed by him walking through the woods with various people while being hunted by some Vikings. The characters aren't that strong. I enjoyed the language of the film, ""Dragon ships carried upon black storm clouds""...seeking the ""Power of the White Christ."" For those who loved pseudo history film such as ""Centurian"" this is a low budget version of that type of film. It was a film that is consumed with dialog, that leaves any coded messages to the viewer. The action is relatively sparse for a Viking Saga. It is a film I kept waiting for it to start, and then it was over.

Parental Guide: 1 f-bomb, attempted rape, old male nudity with their junk a bit blurred.",1374710400,15,1176,4.5424528301886795

5726392,2,B00CMCCAGQ,"Viking Saga was a dark, gray program.  This is the English representation of the Northern invasion.  The acting isn't that good but the story line is fairly decent.
This is the story of a young monk Hereward (Mark Pickering), who along with another monk escape the carnage of their monastery in Lindisfarne when it had been ransacked by Vikings.  The two escape with the bible, or as Hadrada (Joshua Richards) calls it, the word of 'The White Christ'.  They are bound for the refuge and safety of Iona.
Along the way they meet Aethelwulf (Mark Lewis Jones), a warrior of the ilk of Knights Templar.  Aethelwulf ultimately gives his life to protect the Gospel of Lindisfarne as it makes its way to Iona.",1469577600,3,702,4.67479674796748

5726402,4,B00CMCCAGQ,"Most of what has already been said in review is true. The promotional cover is pure cartoon (the Vikings never had horned helmets nor were they leather freaks) and therefore quite deceptive, especially for those who get off on some serious blood and gore. As some are portrayed, Vikings never stumbled around with shaved heads unless they were naturally bald, and few would waste their time or lives tracking down an alleged omnipotent book regardless of its reputation because virtually no one could read in those days, and quite frankly it's likely few Vikings in that particular year in which the event takes place ever saw a book much less knew what one was. In fact the only thing in this film that has any connection to 'actual events' and 'true story' is the fact the Norse did reportedly land on Lindisfarne Island to forage and pillage whatever happened to be around which included a small Abbey.

The Vikings portrayed are not the Max Von Sydow-like tall blonds which is actually closer to the truth, looking rather gritty and grimy after a long nasty sea cruise which is also what a historian would expect to see back then. The frantic monks also look fairly realistic with appropriate ugly mugs and attire. In fact the only really pretty thing to look at is Elen Rhys who plays a wayward Celtic woman with an unexplainably unweathered face creeping around the countryside alone and captive.

However, negatives aside, I found the fictional story line reasonable and the setting appropriate with a plausible outcome if and only if one is ready for realism rather than romantic fantasy & adventure. The acting is good enough and reactive to the circumstances of having a bunch of violent fatalistic smelly dudes showing up uninvited, terrorizing the monks and other denizens into a hysterical frenzy. The ending, while creeping back toward a nearly implausible Hollywood feel-good conclusion, is rather refreshing after an entire session of woodsy dirt and grit.

Overall I actually liked it for what it was and aside from the aforementioned detractions give it four stars. But again a warning, this is not a pop-corning chewing, visually stimulating flick but rather a small introspect and speculation window of what may have happen in the late 8th century when the Norse began to rudely drop in on their across the pond neighbors in increasing numbers. That is, it shows what overwhelmingly most historians believe to be the beginning of the Norse invasions of Anglo-Saxon-Celtic British Isles. So while I give it higher marks for my tastes in this genre, I suspect many will not like the almost absence of glossy action-adventure, hence, this movie -- perhaps may feel their expectations 'burned'.",1412812800,3,2710,4.964757709251101
