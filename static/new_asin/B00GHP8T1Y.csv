6076370,5,B00GHP8T1Y,"The movies are as follows:
  Pitch Black Unrated/Theatrical 5.1DTD-MA and Dark Fury non-Anamorphic 5.1 Dolby Pro Logic
  The Chronicles of Riddick Unrated/Theatrical 5.1 DTS-MA
  Riddick Unrated ( Directors Cut ) / Theatrical 5.1 DTS-MA
Each disc contains both versions listed above along with various extras, behind the scenes, and commentaries. Although I am very pleased with this collection I have a few "" what the @#$ "" moments. These come from owning the Directors Cuts of Pitch Black and The Chronicles of Riddick on earlier DVD releases. The ONLY Directors Cut you will get in this collection is Riddick D-C Unrated, the other 2 movies ARE extended cuts but NOT Directors Cuts. I was awaiting scenes that I knew were supposed to be there, and yet never were. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen these movies because they are all 3 truly classics for buffs of this genre. It is just misleading the way the package is presented.( EDIT) The UV Codes will get you a DC Unrated Riddick in 5.1 Dolby Digital, The Chronicles Unrated 5.1 Dolby Pro Logic, and Pitch Black Unrated 5.1 Dolby Digital...I used VuDu and had the same reaction all of you should...why is Chronicles Unrated and Dolby Pro Logic???? I still haven't figured this out yet, but if I do I will make another edit.",1390003200,77,1290,4.736607142857143
6076371,3,B00GHP8T1Y,"I held off on buying the previous Riddick collection on blu-ray since I was hoping Dark Fury would finally be released in HD. With this set it is included on blu-ray... however...

Dark Fury is included on the same disc as Pitch Black and can be selected from the main menu. Once it starts playing you will notice that the image is window boxed (black bars framing all sides) and that it is far from HD. For all I know the source material isn't HD material and will never look any better, though.",1390003200,9,496,4.333333333333333
6076372,1,B00GHP8T1Y,"I'm in Australia and this full set of riddick movies is not available here so I bought this because it is advertised as being all regions. Couldn't be further from the truth. I get the universal intro and then nothing but a black screen. I've been happy with this site for many years but because of the false advertising with this and also the bluray directors cut of riddick (which is also stated to be all regions but appears not to be) is making me consider to cancel my account and no longer make any purchases. By the way, the bluray of life after people is said to be all regions but is not either.",1389916800,2,604,4.260869565217392
6076373,4,B00GHP8T1Y,"Before the latest movie came out, I had been debating the purchase of the previous Blu-ray collection.  Then I found out the new movie was coming out; so, I decided to wait for this. This collection, also, includes Dark Fury, the animated feature.  This might not be that important to you, but I consider Dark Fury part of the story, and an excellent one, at that.  Now, the collection is complete....unless they make another one.

Now, I know these are are not the best movies, but if you like Vin Diesel, in the Fast & Furious movies, you should love him, in the Riddick movies.  He is the ultimate bad-ass.  Lots of action, excitement, and alien creatures.

The latest movie, Riddick, is not quite as good as the previous movies, but I think it has better characters.  I was not a fan of the CGI alien dog, in the beginning of the movie, but it developed into an interesting character, later on.

Overall, I'm, extremely happy with this purchase.  Besides the movies, on Blu-ray, you also get the UltraViolet versions, and the chose of iTunes, Windows, or Amazon Video versions.  Not bad for the price.",1389916800,21,1105,4.615384615384615
6076374,3,B00GHP8T1Y,"You get 4 films in this set: Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick, the animated movie The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury and Riddick (2013). All the films star Vin Diesel as Riddick (he also lends his voice to the animated Dark Fury). Overall, the picture quality is great and the audio quality is terrific in this release. You get roughly 3 hours of total bonus content plus audio commentaries in this Blu-ray collection. The longest featurette is for Dark Fury: Animatic to Animation (SD, 33 min). UV copies are provided for all the films (except Dark Fury). Although Dark Fury is billed as 1080p by Universal and is on the same disc as Pitch Black, it is not in full HD anamorphic widescreen (it appears to be SD). However, you can't beat the price and fans who own previous Riddick collections can also purchase the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Riddick-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-HD-with-UltraViolet/dp/B00A2H9OZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Riddick (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital HD with UltraViolet)</a>&nbsp;separately.

6076375,5,B00GHP8T1Y,"If you like the Riddick movies but never bought any of them this is your chance to get it all. This collection gives you all four feature films in the Riddick franchise: Pitch Black, Dark Fury, The Chronicles of Riddick, and Riddick. There has been some misleading information on how Dark Fury would be presented, but in the end it seems you are just getting a standard definition version encoded on a Blu-Ray disc. So it sucks that Dark Fury isn't in HD, but at least it's all in one nice, tidy package.

You get all four films as well as a digital download. There is little doubt that all of the films will have their original extras and will include the director's cuts, as they have been previously released on single disc blu-rays. Production-wise it would be easy to just use the previous pressing masters you can make a sure bet it's all going to be there. Pitch Black and Dark Fury will be on a single disk with the other two movies having their own. Here is a quick rundown of the films.

Pitch Black - The movie that started it all. It is a monster movie where swarms of flying carnivores threaten to wipe everybody out. Riddick at this point had technically a supporting role, but the impression the character made was not to be dismissed. He was the reason that movie shines as a creature thriller. Lots of violence in this film, and that made fans craving for more.

Dark Fury - This was a straight to video animated feature produced by Peter Chung, the animator of the Aeon Flux cartoon series. It's really not much more than an ego stroking of the Riddick character, giving him plenty of opportunities to look cool, talk cool, and show amazing feats of prowess. This one feels more like a fan fiction than anything else, but it does give a segueway to the next film.

The Chronicles of Riddick - This venture goes out into the space opera genre with big sets, big bad guys and big action. It puts Riddick in more of a hero role than the anti-hero. He is tasked to save everybody from the militant Necromongers. Because the film went against the style of Pitch Black (and violence was toned down to a PG-13) it put off a lot of fans. I happened to really like it and if you look at it for what it is instead of how much it isn't Pitch Black you may too.

Riddick - This is the latest film and it brings in all of the best aspects of all the previous films into one. You get the violence and foreboding monsters of Pitch Black. You get the cool one-liners and impressive feats of Dark Fury. You get the anti-hero with a moral code of Chronicles of Riddick. It is a personal approach to Riddick that really pushes the franchise back to greatness.

At the time of this review there is a promotional price of about $40 for the collection. This is a sweet deal considering that is $10 per film. If you don't have any Riddick film then this is your chance to nab it. If you have one or two this may still be a good deal if you crave Dark Fury in high definition.",1389571200,130,2970,4.313620071684587

The ONLY reason that this is not a 5-star review is that the product was packaged in a flimsy, wanna-be-cardboard wrapping which was pretty much pulverized in shipping. I didn't notice any damage upon opening the package because the product was shrink-wrapped. When I opened it up to watch one of the movies, the case broke into bits in several areas. Amazingly, none of the discs were damaged. But really. What an awful way to ship a fragile product.

6076459,4,B00GHP8T1Y,"I agree with another reviewer who stated that a card board protective sleeve was not included .  My disc came in a regular, undamaged, plastic blue, Blu-ray case.  The disc are in perfect condition.  Shipping was really quick.  In fact, mine arrived on a Sunday so it was indeed 2 day Prime shipping.  Most Prime shipping take 3 days despite guaranteeing 2 day shipping.  The audio is fantastic on all the movies except ""Dark Fury.""  Speaking of which I really enjoyed it.  I do wish that the producers could have afforded to have given us a full length feature film to build the arc of the story.  However, I understand that Vin Diesel and his movies have been underestimated throughout his career.  I'm not saying that his acting is any where near being on par with academy award worthiness.  However, there are a lot of movie goers who miss the action movies and stars of the 80's & 90's.  I'm a female, with numerous academic and professional achievements and I simply adore action, fantasy and syfi movies.  I watch movies for entertainment, enjoyment and even mindless, impractical fun.  I Love movies like the The Fast & the Furious franchise, Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Hobbit Trilogy, the Terminator franchise, the movie ""Shoot Em Up,""  John Wick, The Jason Bourne movies, Sin City, The Matrix Saga, Everything Riddick, the Transformers franchise, The Expendable movies, The ""Red"" movies, The Transporter movies, The Under World movies, the Die Hard Franchise,  and the Lethal Weapon movies, etc., etc. Thus, I'd like to see the Riddick franchise continue for at least 1 or 2 more movies.
Anyway back to the review of the Blu-ray Riddick collection.  As for the extra footage, there really wasn't that much in each movie. What there was, overall did not add much to the arc of the stories or profoundly enhance its movie.  In total, there was maybe a total of 15 or 20 mins worth of extra footage.  The extra were rather disappointing.  They are not nearly as extensive or as in-depth as most of us have come to expect extras to be.  If you already have this collection in Blu-ray, I honestly can't recommend spending the extra cash on this version.  Prior to this purchase, I did not own any of the movies.  Thus, in my case it was a good purchase.  I would purchase again and recommend under the or similar circumstances.  As for the content of the featured films themselves, I thoroughly enjoyed and have already watched all 3 back to back yesterday and this am 2 or 3 times now. I know! I know! LOL As an aside, I really wish Hollywood had cast Vin Diesel as the newest action hero early on in his career so that we who enjoy them could have had more of him in action movies. In the mid-90's and early 2000's there really was a need to fulfill the shoes of the action movie icons of the 80's and 90's: Sly Stallion, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson to name a few.  Oh well, opportunity missed so 'llI just take him where I can see him.  :-)  Enjoy the collection!",1494979200,6,2995,4.578947368421052
6076460,4,B00GHP8T1Y,"Vin Diesel is a definite superhero as Riddick. The four movies, one is a 35 minute animation, depict a future that will annihilate you unless you are Riddick.

He learns how to fight the beasts and, of course, beat them. First, he needs to recover. He is bleeding and can hardly walk. As soon as this problem is solved he needs to face two groups who have come to the planet to kill him. The sci-fi film is exciting, full of action. As a Rambo-type character, we know he will prevail, but seeing how he does it, and what kind of weapons he uses, is exciting.",1492560000,,589,4.363636363636363

6076561,3,B00GHP8T1Y,"In terms of audio/video, extras, price, and value this is a pretty good riddick deal.  I just wish the copy or the verson i got was not damage.  I don't know who in Amazon decided to put a damage case or a cracked middle case holder, a missing disc container holder part that keeps the 2nd/3rd disc in place  thought it would be okay to sell still.  The discs and digital copy are fine or no damage and work, luckily I had a extra empty bluray case to replace the broken case, but still very sadden of amazon to sell me a product that has been abused and still think its ok to sell just because the discs and digital copy is okay.  This was the replacement for a riddick package that never came too and I was hoping everything would be ok with this.  I really do not want to wait another 2 weeks for a good case then find out the disc are crak or 1 disc is missing, so am just gotta let this slide for now cause this is the first time amazon ever gave me a bad egg.

Yeah other than the bad luck of the case I am very happy watching riddick.  I never watched dark fury.  I did watch chronicles, pitch black,and riddick, but u don't have to watch dark fury to understand the other movies.  I liked how they explain riddicks backstory or his furian origins and made it more than just a survivor horror flick.  Chronicles of Riddick gave us alot of new characters or some deep insight of Riddicks home planet I wish they could of done more or even show baby riddick escaping.

Riddick the movie was a bit of both pitch black and chronicles but I wasn't as great as teh first 2 imo.  The story is pretty much the same as pitch balck or riddick gets stranded on another planet and has to survive another attack and find out a little more about his home planet but doesnt get all the answers he wanted.  They could of done this way better or made a riddick movie about riddicks father or home planet before it was destroyed.  Overall a decent or good action movie that has something for all to see.  Just make sure u DONT get a bad copy like me and riddick fans make sure u watch with a 4k tv.  looks and sounds amazing on my samsung 4k home theater system.",1473638400,5,2151,4.132211538461538

6076627,4,B00GHP8T1Y,"Whether you will enjoy these movies will pretty much squarely fall in whether you like movies that are a blend of action and sci-fi, and know and are willing to accept what comes with that.  If you are, then they are very enjoyable, with decent scripts and acting, great visuals and special effects.  They center around the character of Richard B. Riddick, an escaped murderer who is constantly being hunted by bounty hunters.

The first movie (Pitch Black) involves him and the crew/passengers on a ship he is being transported back to prison on which crash lands on a seemingly deserted planet.  There is a short animated feature called Dark Fury, which extends that story and leads up to the second movie Chronicles of Riddick.  That movie has two central story lines that ultimately intertwine, Riddick out to help one of the survivors of the first film who is now in prison, and taking on a race called Necromancers who take over worlds and convert its inhabitants to their ""religion"" or kill them.  That is the movie with the most overall star power with Judi Dench, Thandie Newton and Karl Urban playing key roles.  The third film, Riddick finds him again on a seemingly deserted planet, and having to survive not only the planet itself, but a band of bounty hunters that end up coming after him.

I will not say more about any of the movies to avoid spoiling it for the few who would be reading this having never seen them. The first and third films are a blend of chase/survival and monster movies.  The second film is really different from the other two, and personally I think told the most interesting story.  Like I said initially, they are very action heavy movies, and while the series as a whole has some great actors in it, it was not written with the intent that it would ever get any acting or writing awards.  Vin Diesel mainly looks stoic and scary, and occasionally fires off some one liners at the other characters.  He does very well with that character, and if you listen to the commentaries he participates in, you know how seriously he takes the character.

For extras, each movie has two versions of the films, the theatrical version and extended unrated versions.  There are commentary tracks on each film, on Pitch Black with the director, Diesel and Cole Hauser who plays Johns.  On the second movie, the director, Alexa Davalos and Karl Urban provide a commentary track and on the last film it is just the director.  There are also several making of and behind the scenes features on every movie.  So if you like going through the bonus material there is a lot there.  All of the movies look and sound great in the Blu-Ray format.  The animated Dark Fury though is just in standard definition.  That did not bother me, but just be aware if it would bother you.",1462060800,21,2792,4.613360323886639

6076650,5,B00GHP8T1Y,"Let's all be honest, these movies aren't good but they are fun to watch, as is the case with all Mark Sinclair movies. Did you know that that is Vin Diesel's real name?... because I just found that out. Mark Sinclair. Weird. I mean... I get why he uses a stage name. Sinclair just sounds kind of hoity toity but Diesel. Heck... he probably just had that nickname because his voice sounds like a frakking (Battlestar reference) diesel engine.

Speaking of Battlestar, Starbuck is in the last movie. Her role is okay but more seemed to be geek fan service than anything. Don't get me wrong, she played her role very well but you cannot fix a bit of the not-so-good writing. It's more those little details like, ""why did they [redacted for spoiler reasons]?"" Geek fan service. ""Why did they [redacted for spoiler reasons]?"" Kinda geek fan service in a weird way. Common geeks, if [redacted] then that cuts out a large number of you who in whom she would be interested.

Karl Urban is in the second one and his character is pretty great. For some reason, though, they cut his part out of the theatrical release of the 3rd one. What the hell? His character was frakking great! Luckily, the director's cut of the 3rd movie puts those scenes back in.

6076709,5,B00GHP8T1Y,"The year 2000 saw two breakout movies that established famous franchises.  The first one was long awaited, X-Men, and would begin the modern comic-book movie craze.  The second, Pitch Black, established Vin Diesel as a solid anti-hero lead who could carry a movie by himself.  After Pitch Black came two subsequent theatrical releases, and an animated direct-to-video movie, all of which progress the tale of Richard B. Riddick, criminal, fugitive, warrior, and savior for many.  All three live-action theatrical releases also had an extended version available on home video.

For fans of the franchise, this is a great purchase as all three live-action films come in both the theatrical and extended versions, with one disc per movie, both versions of each movie on the same disc.  The discs come with all the standard features one would expect from a major Hollywood flick..  You have the interviews with cast and crew, making-of featurettes, and the benefit of two cartoons.  The Pitch Black disc contains the Dark Fury cartoon, which bridges Pitch Black and the Chronicles of Riddick theatrical film.  The Riddick disc contains a cartoon that expands upon some scenes in the movie itself.

The graphics and audio for all the movies are spot on, and look fine to all but the most discerning viewer.  The extended versions of the movies are each about 10 minutes longer than the theatrical version, with no major plot changes or additional characters.  What you get are some small details.  For example, the Riddick extended edition has some extra scenes of Riddick with the Necro-mongers, and some partial nudity on the part of Katee Sackhoff's character Dahl.  Overall, this is a great purchase if one can get it at less than the sum of the prices of the four movies individually.  And a great purchase for any Vin Diesel fan.",1445990400,6,1830,4.954098360655737

6076729,4,B00GHP8T1Y,"Really good package with a lot of bonus features, however there are glitches with the Universal logo on all three discs on the PS3. I'm not sure what causes it, but the first two runs of the Universal logo (first thing to play on the discs) will cause the blu ray to hang and be stopped. Third time works fine, and afterward it works fine. This happened for each disc, so it's not specific to just one - I suspect it has something to do with the download they do at the very beginning, maybe it just doesn't fully complete until a couple of runs?

Otherwise, the sound/visual quality of the disc is great.",1440460800,2,605,4.307017543859649

6076759,5,B00GHP8T1Y,I would of liked to see Riddick in a populated futuristic city in the 3rd film. It felt like the first film.. I heard they had budget issues ect..

6076761,5,B00GHP8T1Y,"The first movie dances around two questions, who would you die for and who would die for you, and so also the value of a life. The answers can be enlightening and quickening. I like to believe they are part of the reason for the statements, ""Not for me. Not for me."" and  ""tell'em ____'s dead. ___ died somewhere on that planet,"" but not as just the obvious responses to the statements that preceded them.

I find the first movie to be right up there with Alien. Both are scifi horror movies and both have very memorable thrills and visuals.

In the other movies Riddick is, at least in the way I like to see him, one who has been sent on from the darkness of the first movie as kind of a reluctant savior who sees the light even in the darkest places. Only those who trust and follow will be saved, and commitments will be challenged.

Maybe that is just me but that is how I like to see it, but the movies are good even without that view.",1433203200,2,940,4.176795580110498

6076764,3,B00GHP8T1Y,"I'm a huge fan of Ultraviolet (digital, Vudu) movies. I often buy the Blu-ray disc just for the Ultraviolet code and resell the disc. I'm also very big on having the full series' of certain movies. Riddick happened to be one of them. For the most part with Blu-ray compilations, you get the same digital versions that are on the discs. I love Ultraviolet because I can access my 300+ HD movie collection wherever I am or whoevers house I'm at. I mainly use Vudu as my Ultraviolet service (owned by Walmart btw) because the Vudu app is built directly into my tv's, all game consoles, and almost all Blu-ray players that have an internet connection.

There's all 4 movies on the discs, which all come in a single case like one disc would come in. Pitch Black & Dark Fury are on the same disc. But the Ultraviolet redemption code is just for Pitch Black, which was a major disappointment to me. Not only did it not have the rare & obscure Dark Fury animated mini-movie, but it left my OCD of having the whole Riddick Collection, digitally, unfulfilled. Vudu sells it separately, so I just bought it directly from them, but I felt I already paid for it when I bought the collection.

Don't advertise half-truths. It should've said in the movies description what versions were included digitally, but instead gave the impression that all 4 movies were included.

Ultraviolet, and digital movies in general, are becoming more & more popular. It's time that either the movie studios that put out the discs, or the retailers that sell them, be more specific when there are multi-disc sets, about exactly what content is included in the box.",1431216000,2,1632,4.659722222222222

My only possible complaint is about the female character in the most recent movie. She was overly sexualized and it was implied that she was gay, but Riddick could somehow make her want him. I felt like I was watching Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. She was BA, though, which you would only expect from the woman who played Starbuck in the Battlestar Gallactica remake.",1424044800,,563,4.574257425742574

6076824,5,B00GHP8T1Y,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description lacking, I decided to compile this list of helpful information below. I hope this will be useful for prospective buyers to know what they're getting:

PITCH BLACK (2000): 109 minutes - Director: David Twohy - Starring: Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser - Genre: Action, Sci-fi, Horror- Plot: A commercial transport ship and its crew are marooned on a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night. But then, they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur. R

THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK (2004): 119 minutes - Director: David Twohy - Starring: Vin Diesel, Colm Feore, Judi Dench  - Genre: Action, Sci-fi - Plot: 5 years after Pitch Black, the wanted criminal Riddick arrives on a planet called Helion Prime, and finds himself up against an invading empire called the Necromongers, an army that plans to convert or kill all humans in the universe. PG-13

THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK: DARK FURY (2004): 35 minutes - Director: Peter Chung - Starring: Vin Diesel, Rhianna Griffith, Keith David - Genre: Animated, Sci-fi - Plot: Riddick finds himself on a giant, sinister spacecraft with a top-security prison and a captain who likes to make statues out of criminals like Riddick. PG-13 (estimate)

RIDDICK (2013): 119 minutes - Director: David Twohy - Starring: Vin Diesel, Karl Urban, Katee Sackhoff - Genre: Action, Sci-fi- Plot: Left for dead on a sun-scorched planet, Riddick finds himself up against an alien race of predators. Activating an emergency beacon alerts two ships: one carrying a new breed of mercenary, the other captained by a man from Riddick's past. R

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $29.49, and contains 4 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $7.37 per film! This is a good deal to own this action-packed and super cool set of gritty action sci-fi films! I hope this information is useful to you. Cheers!",1420329600,,2049,4.890489913544669

Spoiler ALERT......

This sets the scene for Riddick 4 and probably 5 at the end so be prepared to be left hanging a bit.  At least it was more than the previous movies.

You can also tell the budgets have been increasing since the first movie.  It is less gritty and sparse future and there are a lot more gadgets.  Riddicks special eye sight is less sensitive to light in each movie and that bugs me a bit but I'll suspend disbelief and enjoy.

This movie did harken back to the first in many ways and I really appreciated that.  Overall I really liked the third movie and look forward to the next ones.",1395705600,2,802,4.1558441558441555

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Nearly a decade after the release of Pitch Black' and `The Chronicles of Riddick,' director David Twohy and star Vin Diesel are back with a new off-world adventure for the popular antihero Riddick. `The Chronicles of Riddick' the second sequel to `Pitch Black' returns to the moderate budget filmmaking that made that film successful RIDDICK' is definitely a film shot to please long-time fans, like me of this franchise series. The smaller story allows Riddick to refocus on its shadowy protagonist, with stunning special effects. RIDDICK' is totally brilliant and a good science fiction film with decent re-boot for the series.

With this third and final episode of this franchise, is RIDDICK' which is largely dialogue-free and sees Riddick and the jackal adapting to the landscape and hidden dangers of the unnamed planet. There are plenty of venomous mud creatures and alien vultures waiting for a meal, and Riddick must pass through a dangerous cave environment to reach a less dangerous area of the planet. There's fun to be had watching Riddick and the pup cut down these voiceless alien antagonists, and the filmmakers play the man-and-his-dog relationship perfectly. The jackal is impressively rendered via CGI and there are some solid bits of action and humour that follow. Things slow to a grind when Riddick activates the beacon, and he spends a good thirty minutes off screen while the hunters take centre stage.

Several years after the events in `The Chronicles of Riddick,' Riddick has grown bored with leading the Necromonger fleet. Riddick hasn't adopted most Necromonger customs, angering Commander Vaako [Karl Urban], who agrees to transport Riddick to lost planet Furya if he gives up his position as Lord Marshall. Siberius Vaako's aide, Krone [Andreas Apergis], betrays Riddick and leaves him to die on a barren, sun-baked hostile planet that Riddick dubs ""Not Furya."" Out of practice and overly civilised, Riddick must quickly regain his survivalist instinct as the planet is host to a number of hostile creatures. He adopts an abandoned jackal pup that becomes his trusty sidekick and sets out to find a way off the surface. When Riddick stumbles onto a mercenary outpost, he activates an emergency beacon that attracts two groups of bounty hunters hoping to collect on Riddick's head.

The first group to arrive is a ragtag band of killers led by the totally unhinged Santana [Jordi Moll], who is furious when a more professional outfit, led by the Boss, Colonel R. ""Boss"" Johns [Matthew Nable], lands at his camp. Riddick quickly pits the two groups against one another, and Santana realises that Riddick intends to use one of their ships as his taxi off the hostile planet. Riddick turns into a largely unseen puppet master during this section and drops the relatively docile attitude from earlier scenes as he picks off Santana's men one by one and one of Riddick's biggest issues is pacing. The plot is a thinly type alien western, that at times is slightly sluggish around its halfway point, and I found my attention drifting as the bounty hunters bickered among themselves. Since the only supporting characters with any real personality are Santana [Jordi Moll], Colonel R. ""Boss"" Johns [Matthew Nable] and the fierce female warrior Dahl [Katee Sackhoff], this gets pretty boring in a hurry. Viewers know from an earlier scene that a dangerous storm is coming to awaken the planet's dormant native creatures, but the film sometimes lacks a sense of urgency in these particular moments. But Riddick knows that s*** is about to hit the fan, but no one else can see it coming.

Things pick up considerably at the climax of the film, when Riddick and company must fight to survive the Pitch Black-esque killers that roam the night. As a whole, RIDDICK' is decently entertaining B-movie type escapism. The creatures are fierce, and the action is totally awesome. The environment is purposely ugly, and the lack of changing scenery gives a desolate place that no one would want to live on and it is amazing that anything can survive, but having Riddick by your side, makes things more bearable. Time has made Vin Diesel no less effective as Riddick, and it's nice to see the actor given a chance to play alongside a friendly CGI character. I wish David Twohy's script had given Vin Diesel more scope. The supporting cast is OK at delivering some awkward lines, and especially Jordi Moll's performance is perfectly terrible. RIDDICK' further explores the mythology hinted at in previous films, and the Director's Cut adds more to the cliff-hanger, that hints at future events. RIDDICK' overall, despite giving the impression of being a B-grade type science fiction, I really enjoyed Riddick's return to the screen and I hope there are more in the near future, as I love these types of sci-fi films and I especially cannot see enough of seeing Vin Diesel in action, as he is THE ultimate macho muscular man that I really like to see in films, but only this genre and not his other film franchise which he has been churning out like sausage machine with no substance, that are so boring, it makes you want yawn!

Blu-ray Video Quality  The RIDDICK: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION Blu-ray discs have a very competent 2.35:1 and 2.40:1 aspect ratios and an even more awesome 1080p encoded transfer. All 3 RIDDICK films were shot digitally and it retains all the characteristics that you come to expect with these films, both good and bad, especially of digital photography. Detail is very good, and black levels are more than adequate. Though the HD source causes a bit of smearing, there is plenty of texture to be found in the costumes, sets and weapons. I noticed absolutely no issues with noise reduction, aliasing or compression artefacts.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack with all 3 RIDDICK films are so appropriately immersive, and the shrieks of incoming aliens sear through the surround speakers. Ambient effects waft through the sound field and dialogue is perfectly audible at all times. Music, effects and dialogue are nicely layered, and the subwoofer supports the frequent, directionally oriented action effects like gunfire and thunder.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Because there are far too many extras to go into more detail, it is best if you want to know more in depth information, then it is best to check out other web sites for more details on what each extra contains.

Finally, I'm a massive Vin Diesel fan, and I have an awesome admiration for `Pitch Black' and `The Chronicles of Riddick.' As to the latest offering of `RIDDICK,' this was more of a psychological outing which I really enjoyed and gave more depth to the character and what makes him tick. I really thought it was a brilliant well thought out film and it was such a shame it has taken well over ten years to bring it to the screen. On top of that, you have a wealth of Special Features and Extras that will keep you very happy for fans of these brilliant action packed well thought out films. All in all, the conclusion is simple. With a $90,000,000 take on a $40,000,000 budget, the series is still very much alive, and I am really looking hopefully forward to even more RIDDICK franchise films. And if you are definite a fan of this series like me, you should definitely own this Blu-ray RIDDICK: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION and you will not be at all disappointed, in fact you will be stunned with such an awesome package. And as to ALL you fans out there who are still not sure whether to purchase this ultimate package, then you will be missing out on a great deal if you do not add this to your Blu-ray Collection like I have done and I am so proud and honoured to have this in my Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!
