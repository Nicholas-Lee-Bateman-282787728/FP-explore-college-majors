1710025,5,B000065V3K,"This is the ultimate chick flick and never gets old regardless of the number of times I've watched it over the years. Truly under-rated performances from Barbara Hershey and Bette Midler. The only bad parts are the cringe-worthy show scenes with Cee Cee on Broadway and in some of her concerts.  The horrid costumes and dreadful production numbers are baffling. Why??? in hell did the director and writer, with a star of Ms. Midler's calibre and their film budget, come up with such dreadful drivel?  It was a disservice to the star and the movie as a whole. They got it right at the end, with Cee Cee in the gorgeous velvet gown and the orchestra.

Still, this film about friends, the bonds between friends, the love-hate between friends and the enduring power of love is a can't miss.",1508976000,,786,4.640287769784172

1710030,5,B000065V3K,This movie is just enjoyable to watch.  It's getting old by now but it's the stuff life is made of: Unlikely friends who are always there for each other.  The ups and downs; the jealousies that arise between BFF but the love and friendship that over-rides it all.  The ending will always be heartbreaking and in the end I always mourn the loss and devotion that death brings.  It also reminds me of what pleasure a truly great voice brings compared to the copycat stuff out today.  Bette doesn't have to try to out-do her competitors with outlandish and debasing behavior in order to make it on the stage.  Her talent alone got her there and we have the privilege in this movie of reminiscing about that.,1505952000,3,704,4.503937007874016

In addition, the chemistry between the two main characters was unconvincing.  The characters lacked any development and the directing sucked!  I wanted to like this version, as I am a big fan of the Bette Midler, Barbara Hershey version.  However, there was nothing, and that is a huge NOTHING, that is likable about this movie.  It sucks!

But her rehearsal is cut short and she departs we soon learn to be at the side of her life long friend Hillary Whitney played by Barbara Hershey. The story flashes back to the two as young girls hanging out ""under the Boardwalk"" of Atlantic City. The young actresses are memorable as the young girls. The story shifts back and forth until we learn the urgency of the situation. The musical numbers are sensational. Bette Midler is an incredible singer. The soundtrack to Beaches was a huge hit.

1710754,1,B000065V3K,Very predictable formula.  Bettte Midler is talented and funny.  But the story is just too cliche driven,1434412800,,104,5.0588235294117645
1710755,1,B000065V3K,"Movies starring real musicians are either train wrecks or astonishing.  Beaches is an astonishing train wreck. Released in 1988, we decided to watch it as Melissa McCarthy wears a ""Beaches"" watch in her new movie 'Spy' and thought it might be good for a laugh.

Beaches is the movie that gave 'chick flicks' their bad name. It makes Thelma & Louise look like Shakespeare.

Every human interaction is fake. Bette Midler of course is a talent, no one is arguing that, but she can't carry a movie (she's great in smaller roles, like a spice in food). Barbara Hershey looks lost or medicated (or both), John Heard (as both their love interests) looks like he either has hemorrhoids or would rather have them than be in this movie. Spalding Gray plays a doctor who looks like he's just been hit by a phaser on Star Trek. Hershey and Midler are supposedly best friends since they were kids. They look past each other in their dialogue scenes, they have nothing in common, yet each is insanely jealous of the other. Neither goes to the other's wedding.

Do you want to know how bad the dialog is? There is a scene where Hershey is driving a Mercedes convertible IN THE RAIN with the TOP DOWN - she gets out of the car and says ""We got rained out.""

It gets worse. Finally Barbara Hershey gets the ""Dieing while still looking beautiful and finally noticing that there are other people in the room"" disease.

Her death mask make-up varies wildly from scene to scene. Finally, in the hospital, she is sitting up very nicely. You wouldn't know she is ill except she has a tube in her nose. She looks at Bette Midler earnestly and says ""I want to go..."" Bette says ""Where? The Russian Tea Room?"" ""No, I want to die."" The relief on Midler's face is hilarious.

It could be arranged. Any audience member would be happy to stroll up and take care of it for you. Just pinch Barbara Hershey's oxgen tube until she stops ""Acting"".

Two hours of my life I will never get back. Don't make the same mistake.",1434412800,2,1986,4.481994459833795

Bette was ruff and unpolished and Barbara was dignified, rich and poised as a lady.  You almost knew something was wrong and it couldn't last and there is a breakup but when the chips came down on Barbara, Bette changed and held onto her best friend till the end.  Bette sing's like a beautiful angel ""The Wind Beneath My Wings"".  It was more of a hit than the movie, I think.  I believe had this top notch performance by Bette and Barbara as both women are great performer's.  Laughter and tier's this is what the movies of the late 80's and early 90's were about, showing life to be something we need to think about and hold fast to our friends while we can.",1425945600,,810,4.33112582781457

I'm not quite sure what Amazon is thinking though with the trailer that they placed on the instant streaming version!! If I had not seen the movie and absolutely fallen in love with it, I'd think it was completely ludicrous based on the trailer, and that is NOT that trailers are designed for!! Do yourself a favor, viewers, try this movie anyway despite the trailer and Amazon PLEASE take down this stupid trailer if you're not going to put the theatrical trailer up!! This movie is about the lasting bonds of friendship, the true meaning of love, loss and loyalty. I am just appalled to think that some people might be turned away thinking that this is a slapstick movie or something like that when actually it's one of the greatest platonic love stories between women of all times, even now almost 27 years later.

1710936,5,B000065V3K,"Beaches is the ultimate buddy movie. It has all the aspects that make an excellent movie: humor, drama, love, hatred, jealousy, music, etc. When I was younger, my mother often told me that her older brother's favorite movie of all-time was Beaches. At the time, I didn't know what Beaches was, until I caught it on TV one day. I fell in love with it. I ordered it on DVD, and I've gotten by seven-year-old niece hooked on it. We've watched it so many times!

Beaches starts in 1958 Atlantic Jersey, New Jersey. An adorable little rich girl, Hillary Whitney (originally Marcie Leeds) and child performer C.C. Bloom (originally Mayim Bialik) meet under the boardwalk. Despite their differences--Hillary being rich and C.C. being seemingly poor--the two become fast friends. Their lives soon separate them, but over the next several years, they become pen pals, sharing secrets, discussing their lives, and strengthening their friendship. As they age, they continue to find comfort through each others' letters. One day Hillary (now played wonderfully by Barbara Hershey) comes to New York to catch up with C.C. (now played perfectly by Bette Midler) and they two move in together. The story continues through their love triangles, marriages, friendship setbacks, pregnancies, and death.

Beaches is the ultimate buddy movie. I know I've already said that, but it is worth repeating. Its better than Fried Green Tomatoes and Steel Magnolias, its perfect! Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey were perfectly cast and deserved Oscars. Midler's performance of the song ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" at the end of the movie is tearjerking. I love this movie. It will definitely not disappoint.",1413590400,,1676,5.135531135531136

Celebrate the power of everlasting friendship with `BEACHES' available for the first time on Blu-ray, featuring a new digital restoration. Academy Award nominees Bette Midler for Best Actress 1991: For The Boys and Barbara Hershey for Best Supporting Actress 1996: The Portrait Of A Lady star in this funny and touching film from legendary director Garry Marshall.

When the irrepressible C.C. Bloom and the shy and proper Hillary Whitney first meet under the boardwalk, all the 11-year-olds have in common is the need for a best friend. Worlds apart in a lifestyle and location, their friendship ebbs and flows through a lifetime of highs and lows. From the boardwalk in Atlantic City to a beach house on the Pacific, `BEACHES' will remind you what being a true friend really means. Relive every heart-warming moment on Blu-ray High Definition.

FILM FACT: Included on the soundtrack was Bette Midler's performance of ""Wind Beneath My Wings,"" which became an immediate smash hit. The song went on to win Grammys for Record of the Year and Song of the Year in 1990. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction for Albert Brenner and Garrett Lewis.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: When I had the Special Edition NTSC DVD of BEACHES' back in 2005, my life was considerably different from what it is now. And today as I view this special Blu-Ray version of the film, with that same cover art, I wondered if my opinion of this film will be the same, well I was proved wrong and have found it is a vast improvement of the inferior NTSC DVD as it still the same the same ambience that only Bette Midler can deliver and it can still be a big tear-jerker type film, which always happens when watch this film for the umpteenth time, but to me it's still the same beautiful film. I will say, the ending has far more of an impact on me now; however I find I'm far more susceptible to emotional manipulation by the watching this film.

The box office hit BEACHES [1988] starring Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey was based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Iris Rainer Dart about the lasting friendship between two very different women. The free spirited but poor Cecilia Carol ""C.C."" Bloom [Bette Midler] and the uptight aristocratic Hillary Whitney Essex [Barbara Hershey] meet as children in Atlantic City and form a lifelong bond that endures conflicts, boyfriends, marriages, babies, divorces and even death.

BEACHES' starts out by establishing the foundation of the eternal friendship between, Cecilia Carol ""C.C."" Bloom [Miyam Bialik] and Hillary Whitney Essex [Marcie Leeds], a street-smart Atlantic City kid and an upper- crust child, respectively. Meeting under the boardwalk, they find they are kindred spirits of sorts, and thus start a relationship that spans the rest of their lives through letter writing, until both Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey become adults. Finally getting together again, and find their friendship is the only constant in their lives. The prologue, with brilliant work by Cecilia Carol ""C.C."" Bloom [Miyam Bialik] age 11 years old and Hillary Whitney Essex [Marcie Leeds] age 11 years old, gives the film a smart-aleck attitude that helps overcome the more heartstring-pulling moments...for the most part.

From there on out, the two women find life to be a series of struggles, with them switching places, as Cecilia Carol ""C.C."" Bloom [Bette Midler] life explodes into mega-success, and Hillary Whitney [Barbara Hershey] hits roadblock after roadblock. Through it all, they rely on their friendship to carry them through the challenges that love, marriage and family bring. The friendship is tested often, especially by the dreaded presence of men, but it's hard to believe that anyone in the audience has a doubt about what will happen in the end. BEACHES often risks drifting into melodrama, but Bette Middler's irreverent presence keeps the movie on an even keel until the plot becomes too heavy to maintain buoyancy.

Using Cecilia Carol ""C.C."" Bloom and Hillary Whitney Essex's flashback correspondence as the main method of progressing the story along, along with an in-the-now framing device, the film spans 30 years in two hours, which by any measure is moving at light speed. There are some problems with moving the story so quickly, in that the plot can seem unnaturally motivated. But within the structure of the plot, there's no other way the film could have advanced the story. By compressing the lives of these two women, the parallels between them are made obvious and meaningful.

While the story of these two women is the core of the film, Bette Midler's musical moments are some of the most entertaining portions of the film. From her character's start as a jazz singer to her award-winning performances, she gets the opportunity to show off her impressive range as a vocalist. I've always considered Bette Midler to be extremely good, based on her roles in Ruthless People' and Outrageous Fortune' [which I wish they would release on Blu-ray] but BEACHES' goes to show why she gets the respect she receives. Singing ability like hers and an amazing comic wit has combined to make her a true star.

At approximately the halfway point, the film loses its sense of humour and becomes like a sort of soap opera, but not a bad one, especially with Cecilia Carol ""C.C."" Bloom speaks badly about at the time of the change. Life itself is too much for the girls, and the whole film becomes exactly what the first half seemed to strive to avoid. Ironically, it's that turn-around in the second half that has earned the film its fan base and massive reputation. It takes a heap of nurturing to make and keep a friend over the long haul of a lifetime. BEACHES illustrates a few of the challenges, disappointments, and rewards of this worthwhile endeavour. With its mix of drama, comedy, and music, the film leaves behind a rainbow of delectable emotions for all ages.

When BEACHES went into production, Bette Midler was enjoying a wave of success ushered in by her association with Disney's adult-oriented Touchstone Pictures. Bette Midler had made hits like Down and Out in Beverly Hills [1986] and Ruthless People [1986] for Touchstone which many credited for revitalizing her career as a comic actress in the 1980s. With Touchstone Pictures, Bette Midler formed her company All Girl Productions and co-produced BEACHES as her first project.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The very nice 1080p encoded transfer on this disc is remarkably better than the mess that existed on the previous Blu-Ray. That said, it still has some issues, as it's uneven in the handling of grain, with some scenes buzzing and others, mostly darker interior scenes later in the film, looking stunningly clean, to the point where they could have been shot this year. Everything has been given a polish, so the vast majority of the dirt and damage seen on the inferior NTSC DVD has gone with the rare exception of a spot or two. Fine detail has been vastly improved, though there's some softness here and there, and the colour has been made far more natural (and warmer), even if it all looks a touch darker. At its best, it looks fantastic, while at its worst it's much better than the previous release. It's worth nothing that it appears that the image was opened up on all sides on this release, showing more in all directions. The aspect ratio (listed on the box as 1.85:1) seems to be the same between the two, but the framing seems better on the new transfer.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  BEACHES' 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix is pretty front heavy, to the point where surround channels only really kick in when Midler sings. There is some occasional noticeable surround activity, especially the boardwalk scene is a good example, but even then, the bulk of the mix is tilted toward the front channels. There is also widely differing reverb and ambient recording effects quite noticeable in some of the post-looped material, with the van scene with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey, especially when Bette Midler is in the bunny suit, one of the more obvious examples. In scenes like that one, the dialogue sounds overly tinny and boxy compared to the bulk of this track. Fidelity is generally very good, especially in the musical sequences.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Director Garry Marshall: Gary Marshall is always fun to listen to, and he's quite funny through large swaths of this commentary. Gary Marshall is quite gracious in doling out accolades to various people involved in the film. Gary Marshall makes nonstop fun of some of the plot machinations, and that actually helps to make some of the more saccharine elements in the film go down a little easier.

Special Feature: Beaches Bloopers [6:59] We get just over a six-minutes reel. Apparently created for use back in 1988, this one offers the usual goofs and giggles, though a narrator attempts humorous commentary as well. It's typical for its genre.

Special Feature: Mayim Bialik Remembers Beaches [2011] [12:06] This is a very sweet reminiscence of her performance in the film BEACHES by the current day star of The Big Bang Theory.

Special Feature Music Video: ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" Performed by Bette Midler [1988] [4:32] ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" (sometimes titled ""The Wind Beneath My Wings"" and ""Hero"") is a song written in 1982 by Jeff Silbar and Larry Henley.

Special Feature: AFI's 100 Years . . . 100 Songs With Bette Midler [1988] [1:17] This is the segment of this special devoted to ""Wind Beneath My Wings."" The top 100 songs of the past 100 years chosen by the American Film Institute are presented by host-actor John Travolta.

Special Feature: Barbara Hershey Screen Test [1988] [6:18] Shows a scene in which Cecilia Carol ""C.C."" Bloom and Hillary Whitney make up with each other as well as a couple of subsequent sequences. Bette Midler works with Barbara Hershey in the test, so that makes the reel more interesting than it otherwise might be.

Theatrical Trailer [2:12] The Blu-ray disc opens with trailers for `The Odd Life of Timothy Green' and `Monsters University.' These also pop up under Sneak Peeks along with clips for ABC TV series and Castle. We also get the trailer for BEACHES' as well.

Finally, BEACHES' is a wonderful warm hearted true classic, the kind of weepy film everyone likes to curl up with on a rainy Sunday for the stereotypical ""good cry."" It's hardly worth debating the quality of the filmmaking, as it's secondary to the emotions involved for fans of this film. This Blu-Ray is a considerable improvement in terms of the visual quality, and though there are no changes in the contents from the now inferior old NTSC DVD, it offers a decent package of extras, thanks largely to Garry Marshall's commentary. If you're a fan and you've never owned `Beaches' there's not likely to be a better version down the line at this point in time and that is why it is a great honour to add this to my ever increasing Bette Midler Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

 What happens after they meet again in person. is the basis of the story.  Break out the tissues, you will need the whole box.
Bette Midler also performs a lot of songs. This is a 100%  woman's movie.",1385510400,,454,4.183908045977011

1711049,4,B000065V3K,"This movie has everything, a life-long friendship, one of the friends makes it big on Broadway, the other friend marries really well for happiness, great songs, great acting and more!  C.C. meets Hillary when they are very young and become instant friends although they are polar opposites.  C.C. is from a poor family and works as a singer and dancer while Hillary is from old money, lots of old money!  The young C.C. is played brilliantly by Mayim Bialik.  They faithfully write to each other all their lives with visits as often as possible even though they live on opposite coasts.  C.C. is there for Hillary when her husband gets caught cheating and HIllary discovers she is pregnant.  Hillary is there for C.C. at the openings of her shows and for her divorce.

This is a beautiful, sensitive story about two women with rich, luscious characters developed.  Just looking at the looks on their faces makes you feel what they are feeling.  There is so much more to the story, but I hate spoilers, so I won't do that to you.  Just trust me that this movie didn't become a classic for nothing.",1382486400,,1096,4.632124352331606

1711051,5,B000065V3K,"This is a very good movie.  I'm a big Bette Midler fan, film wise and music wise.  I think she is a very talented woman with a gifted voice and a gift for acting as well.  This film is really good, telling the story of a friendship that lasts from childhood to death and beyond, a tale of two friends who write to each other over the years and remain a part of each other's lives through the ups and downs of life.  Bette Midler is such a great singer that I like the movie just for the parts where she sings, but I also love the scenes from plays she does in the film, especially the one about how the brassiere was invented and got its name (that's a real hoot).  This is a good movie for a good price.  It's what I would call a real tear jerker yet it is also a film about love and facing the pain of loss and finding joy and happiness in life even through your heartache.  It's one of my favorite Bette Midler films though ""The Rose"" and ""Big Business"" are my number one and two favorites.",1382227200,,993,4.035714285714286

1711058,5,B000065V3K,"This is a wonderful movie. I think about Midler has been an underrated entertainer for many years now despite her huge success I believe that she deserves more credit for the work she has done in the entertainment industry. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys tearjerkers, dramas, or stories about famous people and their rise to fame. This is a film that has flown under the radar for a long time and received poor reviews upon it's release However, I believe that it is a work of art and a story about lifelong friendship and how pride can interfere with our relationships when we need to focus on the humanity and friendship between ourselves.",1379116800,,659,4.641025641025641

1711063,3,B000065V3K,"I find it rather hilarious that I have friends who outright refuse to ever watch this movie.  In fact, I've had one friend note on a quiz that the one film he will never agree to watch is `Beaches'.  At the time, I hadn't seen the film so I really had no idea why he would refuse to watch anything, but then again I'm one of those people who wants to give everything a fair shake.

Having finally seen the film, I know he'd hate it so he's better off living in his world of ignorance.

This is about as saccharine and dripping with melodrama as a Ron Howard film, and yet it fails to reign in enough to make it feel truly moving beyond simple stock emotions.  Yes, you'll cry (or at least feel sad) but at the end of the day I didn't feel a real connection here.  Maybe it is the structure of the film that fights against it and doesn't truly allow the relationship to develop as a whole.  Instead, it feels very structured.

They embrace, they fight, they embrace, they fight, they embrace, the fight, they embrace.

There isn't much else to the story and so when the finale comes the relationship feels somewhat stereotypical and not very embedded.  When the theme song (Midler's take on `Wind Beneath My Wings') takes over the closing credits we are supposed to be moved to tears and yet there was something that rang false in the delivery.  Still, this has amassed legions of fans, most of which are going to disagree with my review.  This is not a bad film at all.  It is enjoyable in parts, and Midler is a wonderful scenery chewer.  Still, it isn't one that will stay with me.",1376352000,2,1583,4.322033898305085

If you enjoy films that stir deep emotions and make you reflect on your own relationships, then this film is for you.  If not, well, look elsewhere.

I'd heard a lot about this movie.  That it was heartbreaking, inspiring, etc. A feel good but also make you cry type of movie.  And of course the rumours were all true, I just barely kept from crying.

The movie starts with CC Bloom (Bette Midler) receiving a letter and immediately taking off for places unknown despite having an upcoming show (she's a singer) that night.  As she drives, the movie drifts into flashbacks.

The setting appears as a beach and a young girl named Hillary Whitney (Marcie Leeds and then later Barabara Hershey) is lost and can't find her way back to her hotel.  She meets a young CC (Mayim Bialik) who was hiding under the boardwalk smoking and they quickly become fast friends when CC says she'll help her find her hotel.  First though, CC has an audition which Hillary attends and discovers that her new friend is truly talented.  Living on opposite ends of the country, they become pen pals and continue writing to each other for many years until Hillary, now a lawyer, decides she needs a change and runs away to New York where CC, a struggling singer, takes her in.  They become roommates and both start doing what they love, just trying to be happy and enjoying each other's friendship.

Turmoil of course comes when they both like the same man and then Hillary's father becomes sick.  After she returns to care for her father they still write, but their lives drift somewhat apart.  Hillary marries her father's lawyer and tries to be happy despite his wandering ways and CC marries her director, who always carried a torch for Hillary and doesn't know what to do with CC's boundless ambition.  CC becomes successful and Hillary a housewife and when they next meet up they find it hard to like the new people each other has become.  They  don't reunite until Hillary finds herself single and pregnant and CC divorced and her star falling.

They both, with the help of each other, find their way back to success but then discover that Hillary has caught a rare heart disease.  Her daughter is now older and very high spirited and CC finds it hard to get along with her and wants to be there for her friend.  The three must find ways to deal with Hillary's sickness and remain close while discovering what true friendship is.

Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey both do a wonderful job playing the two very different friends in this film.  They both have a lot of character and Bette especially has a vivaciousness that is hard to ignore.  The daughter (Grace Johnston) does an ok job but its hard to recognize her with such acting powerhouses in the movie as well.  The two do a great job of expressing friendship with its ups and downs and how together, two people can be happy and have an everlasting friendship despite their differences.

The music in this film was of course wonderful.  Midler has a great voice and her ever popular ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" really steals the show.  It's a well known song and used for a variety of events (we sang it in school when a beloved principal retired) and definitely expresses a lot of emotion.  Hearing it in the proper context with the movie made it that much more poignant.  The other music was good too although I do have to say I didn't care much for the variety type ""show"" that Bette sang and acted to in the movie.

There are some hard lessons in this film.  Friends can find it easy to betray each other and after doing so, it takes a lot to repair the friendship.  But it can be done.  Its all about choices and I think the movie does a great job of showing how different choices affect people.

The only thing I didn't really like about this movie was CC Bloom some of the time.  I found her younger self obnoxious and couldn't really connect with the older CC Bloom.  I understand that she was supposed to be somewhat self absorbed but that made it hard to understand or relate to her sometimes.  I guess that is just a testament on how well her character was played though and the fact that she had imperfections is a positive.

Sad movie, an absolute tear jerker, but worth the watching.  It seems that it would be appropriate for all ages.  I don't see viewers who prefer action or horror type films liking the movie too much, but it is perfect for those who like chick-flicks.

1711173,5,B000065V3K,"Miss Midler is at her very best here...warm, touching, sentimental.. and Miss Hershey is no slouch either.. Highly recommended.",1286582400,,127,5.7368421052631575
1711174,5,B000065V3K,"When Bette Midler finds a script that grabs her she dives in head first and it shows in her performance. No director can bring out what she feels more than that first impression she had when she reads the script in deciding whether or not to take the part. Of all the movies she's done there are two that shine through as classics in her pantheon of performances and I would humbly submit that ""The Rose"" is the first and ""Beaches"" is the second.

Her participation in picking Mayim Baylik as her 11-year-old younger self was exhausting as Garry Marshall later admitted but Bette is a perfectionist and wanted someone who emulated her as closely as possible when she was that age.

I absolutely hate it when someone slams the classification ""chick-flick"" on a movie. Does that mean that every action-adventure is supposed to be for men only? I love a good action-adventure as much as any man does so why can't a man admit that sometimes it's okay to see the softer side of a friendship between women? I know plenty of men who enjoy Beaches and Steel Magnolias. It's ridiculous to classify films as ""chick-flicks"". If anything you can classify Beaches as a ""friendship"" movie that runs deeply into the human condition.

It could have become deeply maudlin and caused people to flinch with an almost deadly pain but Garry Marshall's direction coupled with the skillful acting of the ensemble cast caused this story to be crafted into a fine woven fabric like antique tapestry that you just have to own. By the time Hillary Whitney is sitting on the deck at the beach waiting to die and the notes of ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" start playing, if you don't feel tears on your cheek then you aren't human. If this is a chick-flick then why is it that a man directed it so skillfully?

I remember seeing an interview with Bette Midler at one time that she and Garry Marshall were talking about a sequel to Beaches and how CC Bloom coped with raising Hillary's daughter but I guess that never happened. That's a shame because I would have dearly loved to have seen that.

Beaches is a ""must-see"" movie if you want to let out those built-up emotions over a hard month. Your problems will just melt away when you see it and you'll feel better after a good cry whether you're male or female.",1282953600,3,2277,4.557457212713937

1711184,5,B000065V3K,"In Atlantic City two eleven-year-old girls meet on the beach. One is very loud and brassy, very show businessy, and the other more sedate and ladylike. The two become instant friends and mug for the camera as they have four pictures in a strip taken by one of those olden days coin-operated machines in an arcade. They tear the strip in two, and each girl keeps two pictures. The movie is bookended by two beaches, one in Atlantic City at the beginning and the other on the Pacific outside of San Francisco at the ending.
 Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey play the parts of the two women. Bette becomes a big singing star, the other becomes a lawyer.
 There are some good songs in the movie, but I wish Bette Midler had been given a few more really good numbers to sing to show off her talent. She and Hershey do good acting jobs in this movie. It's a real tear-jerker, heartwrenching, targeting the audience's tear ducts, but the film does have an aura of sincerity and authenticity.
It has an interesting and well-constructed plot. The friendship has its ups and downs. Bette is selfish, egotistical, and envious. Her friend is better looking, better behaved, but has marital problems. Bette has marital problems too but because she puts her career first.
A worthwhile movie, sentimental, touching, original and entertaining, but it's more than a chick flick.",1216339200,3,1361,4.762711864406779

1711208,5,B000065V3K,"""Beaches"" is a film about two best friends from two very different worlds. Barbara Hershey plays the role of a well-to-do young woman, who on summer vacation at her father's beach house, as a child (played by a child actress), befriends another little girl played by the girl from ""Blossom,"" who is from Brooklyn and is from the ""wrong side of the tracks,"" but has dreams of making it big someday in show business as a singer.

Fast forward, they grow up, become succesful in their own right, but take very different paths--only to be reunited again.

Sadly, one of the characters develops cancer and passes away leaving her best friend to raise her daughter as her own.

I highly recommend this film to anyone, who enjoys a heart-felt drama, but be prepared to have the kleenex box beside you because you will definitely shed some tears, at least, I did.

The good thing is that it's only a movie and not based on a true story, which is how I coped with it, but still cried.

Buy it or rent it, but either way, make sure and view this delightful, heart-warming film because you'll be glad that you did--I know that I am.

Incidentally, ""Did you ever know that you're my hero"" is the main song played by the unforgetably-talented Bette Midler.

1711209,5,B000065V3K,"Good friends are hard to find. Some people go through life finding real friends. There will be friends but there is only one true friend who'll stand by you through thick and thin. Beaches is an example of friendship that started from childhood until the death of one friend.

Hilary and Claire met in Atlantic City when they were children and kept in contact with each other through letters until they were grown. Hilary shows up in New York and stays with Claire. Their relationship is tested when a man enters their lives. He helps Claire with her career but their marriage doesn't last. Claire is too wrapped up in her career to be focused on a real relationship. But Claire doesn't go astray from her dreams unlike Hilary.

Hilary wanted to break from her elite roots but she found herself returning when her father died and she married a lawyer who cheated her out of a marriage with another woman. She was forced to return to law when she got pregnant with her daughter and no husband to support her. Then tragedy strikes.

Bette Midler is a multitalented woman who can display her acting and singing abilities. She evolves into her character who is pretty much a diva. Barbara Hershey is innocent yet strong as her character who displays manners of old wealth.

This is a movie that will make the viewer value the meaning of friendship and why it is important to havae people in their life.",1135036800,6,1398,4.602409638554217

Romantics will love the film, which should also appeal to anyone who likes a good story well told. The performances are spot on and the script doesn't miss a step. As one of the characters is a singer, there are some great songs and musical numbers, memorably performed by Bette Midler. The extras include a director's commentary and outtakes as well as on interesting and entertaining interview where Mayim Bialik recalls her experiences of the making of the film (and boy, can she talk). The Barbara Hershey screen test is interesting in that it takes place at locations other than those in the film, thus providing in effect, alternative takes. The packaging is however a let down. The cover art is unimaginative and a leaflet contains only chapters, surely a waste of time if scene selection is available on the disc.

1711214,3,B000065V3K,"Trust, communication, and care are three key ingredients when two individuals form a friendship, as these components maintain and foster mutual respect and understanding.  Trust entails two individual's ability to share secretive and personal information without limitations, as there is no fear of harm and judgment.  Listening is the vital portion of communication while the other shares his or her personal information.  Without this kind of communication it becomes hard to share information, and difficult to form friendship.  To provide the best possible attention through good communication and trust one displays that one cares.  If two individuals care it becomes possible for the most unlikely individuals to form an improbable friendship, as C C Bloom (Bette Midler) and Hillary Whitney (Barbara Hershey) do in Beaches.

C C rehearses for a performance at the Hollywood Bowl when she receives a message, an unknown message to the audience, but the audience can decipher the social codes that are important as C C drops everything including the evening performance in order to get to San Francisco.  This opening directs the audience into the direction of something immediately threatening.  The question is what can be so important to C C, as she leaves everything behind and rents a car to drive in a rainstorm to San Francisco.  Two lengthy flashbacks deliver the reason for why it is important to C C to drive through the storm.

The first flashback begins decades earlier in Atlantic City where Hillary has lost herself along the boardwalk, as C C notices her while hiding in order to smoke a cigarette.  Helpfully, C C emerges from underneath the boardwalk, as she tells Hillary that she knows the hotel where she is staying.  This moment brings the two together, as C C's mother appears to tell her that she has received an opportunity to audition for a Hollywood film director.  C C asks, or more like tells, Hillary to tag along, as she get to witness C C's star quality, which bedazzles her. T his seems to be the moment when Hillary discovers that C C has confidence to do what she pleases-something that is foreign to her.  However, it is the beginning for a long friendship that seems to be held together through long letters of reciprocal sharing of thoughts and feelings, as the two girls mature into women.

The story makes several leaps, as it skips years at a time.  These leaps cause a hurried effect in the story, which do not seem to emphasize the emotional character development.  This hurts the cinematic experience, as story does not offer a genuine feeling for the characters.  Both women seem hollow and empty in their emotional portrayal, which is supposed to be the strength of the film.  To further the lack of emotional quality, the film presents a quantity of cinematic clichs that are supposed to provide emotional tension and affection.  Nonetheless, there are moments in the film where the story grabs the audience with heartbreaking and joyous tears.

The friendships between C C, a spoiled and ditsy self-centered diva with a Jewish heritage from the Bronx, and Hillary, a well-mannered aristocratic lawyer with a well-established background from outside San Francisco are an unlikely alliance.  These two women beat the odds and remain friends far into adulthood where their friendship gets tested, as their trust and communication are broken leaving them careless of each other.  Nonetheless, it is expected that these two women will mend their friendship, as they go through marriages and divorces and through years of joy and sadness.

Beaches offers a melodramatic tale that temporarily displays moments of great drama, but often regresses into the genre of television soap operas.  At times the film seems like the lines were written and never spoken, and at times the characters seem awkward with the lines.  This furthers the difficulty in the film.  In addition, the film plays with the audience's empathetic side, as it purposely manipulates the audience's affection in a crude manner.  This crudeness leaves the audience with moments of tears, yet it also leaves a feeling of having been cheated of genuine emotion.  Despite the poor depiction of the story it offers some valuable lessons worth pondering, which at the end leaves the audience with an ok cinematic experience.",1113782400,9,4332,5.044943820224719
1711215,5,B000065V3K,"Honestly, I would give this movie three stars, but with Bette and Barbara Hershey's heartbreaking performances, it deserves two more stars! I saw this Fabulously Entertaining Tearjerker at the theater, and have rented it at least twice over the years. It's the kind of film that I can embrace myself with emotionally, that's why it's always a touching experience. Anyone who hasn't had enduring friendships and are emotionally ""locked up"" will not like this movie. If you are a fan of Bette like myself and loved her in For The Boys, The Rose, or Stella, then this is a must see. Barbara Hershey is great, but it's ultimately Bette who dominated the viewers with her sassy and funny performance, and of course the songs in this movie, especially The Wind Beneath My Wings have been heard a million times, but it's still one of her best and most beloved!

It's a perfect vehicle for Bette to showcase her multi-talent as singer and actress delivering a funny and touching performance. It's so enjoyable to watch her whenever she plays a woman in showbiz. The everlasting friendship between Bette and Barbara Hershey's characters are very real representation of many ordinary lives. It takes a lot of unconditional love, respect, trust, and faith to maintain a long distance friendship for decades. No matter what happened in their lives, they know they would still have each other to share their struggles and happiness. Never let time and distance wash away their best intensions and promises.

1711217,5,B000065V3K,"BEACHES, based on the novel by Iris Rainer Dart, is a fantastic and emotion-driven drama/comedy.  Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey turn in fabulous fully-realised performances as two best friends who share an amazing relationship.

On the beach in Atlantic City, 11-year-olds CC Bloom and Hillary Whitney strike up a friendship that will endure beyond all obstacles.  Through letters spanning the years, the two women vent their frustrations, hopes and dreams.

Bette Midler is mesmerising as the brash CC Bloom (the 'Otto Titsling' number is alone worth the price of admission).  Barbara Hershey wisely downplays the role of Hillary though she never is upstaged by Midler.

Supporting roles from John Heard, Spalding Gray and Lainie Kazan (as CC's mother Leona) are right on target.  Mayim Bialik (TV's ""Blossom"") plays the younger CC.

Watch Bette as someone is talking to her in a scene, her facial reactions alone are just hilarious. She is a comedic genius. There are few movies that actually make me LOL, Bette's performance makes me laugh everytime in this film. The child who played Bette was also wonderful...
Barbra Hershey pulls off the other half of the film OK, but it is Bette that makes this movie. Great soundtrack too! I always get teary eyed when Bette is singing ""The Glory of Love"" at the end of the movie, and waves up in the air to heaven at Hillary.
But why is this a barebones DVD release? This was a huge movie. there are no extras? WHY? Not even a trailer? The DVD gets only 1 star. The movie gets ***1/2. Boo to Touchstone for putting this classic film on such a cheap DVD.",1061769600,7,868,4.331288343558282

I enjoyed very much seeing Bette showcase her voice in the movie because she has such a strong and beautiful voice, not to mention she is so hilarious. The scenes in this movie are emotional, uplifting, comedic and poignant. This film reminds of a special friendship that I have, and just watching the movie reminds me a lot of my relationship with my friend. It depicts that all friendships aren't perfect, everyone has their differences but that in the end that one special friend will always be there for you. In this world today, it is hard to find a friend like that. There were also some stellar performances by John Heard as the love interest of Bette Midler, Laine Kazane as Bette's mother Leona. What a wonderful movie, a real tearjearker and call it a chick flick if you want but this is a movie that was made for both men and women.",1052870400,6,1019,4.396825396825397

1711234,3,B000065V3K,"""Beaches"" is the story of two little girls, Hilary Whitney (Barbara Hershey)and C.C. Bloom (Bette Midler)who develop a life long friendship under the boardwalk in Atlantic city that sees them through their respective good times and rough spots. Yes, it's over acted and full of schmaltz.  Yes, it's terribly contrived and not very realistic. But word to the wise: bring Kleenex in advance.  You'll wind up crying by the end.  This is one of those slick packaged and even more slick marketed Touchstone films from the mid-eighties that proved irresistable to the general public.  Midler gets a chance to sing some truly awful tunes and one real show stopper - ""Wind Beneath My Wings"".  If you haven't heard it I've one question for you - ""What planet have you been living on?""  Yes, the film is maudelin in its premise and execution but the syrup works and has proven to be a highly durable in the intervening decades.
Disney Inc. gives us the movie in anamorphic widescreen and that's pretty much it.  While the colors have dated and slightly faded, the transfer is generally smooth throughout, with minimal edge enhancement.  There is no aliasing or fine detail shimmer.  The soundtrack is typical 80's 2.0 surround.  There's some nice spread during the musical sequences but overall this is a very dated sounding soundtrack.  No extras.  Perhaps we'll see this as a Vista Series double disc one of these days.  Bottom line: Good movie, mediocre transfer - still worth the price and your time.",1048809600,9,1494,4.880952380952381

Two very different people, but a bond that would carry them through a lot. In the beginning as children they meet under the boardwalk. CC is very different from Hilary, an aspiring child star, whereas Hilary comes from a high class background. Two differing lives are told through letters to each other over the years, when finally Hilary rebels and decides to visit CC and live with her. They both meet a director, CC falls in love with him but he falls for Hilary. CC ends up marrying him, and Hilary goes back when her father is ill and ends up marrying a lawyer. When the four meet up again, Hilary and CC fight an awful lot and CC tries to make up by writing letters to her, which are sent back unopened. Hilary finds out her husband is cheating on her, and finds out she is pregnant as well. Hilary goes back to see CC and they make up, Hilary was jealous. Hilary gives birth to her daughter, and finds out she has the same heart disease that killed her mother when she was a child. Sadly Hilary ends up dying, and leaves her daughter to be taken care by CC.

This movie can definitley pull the heartstrings of anyone with any sense of compassion as is a reason why many of the male critics bashed it. As I was a young preteen when I first saw it, I cried rather easily. THis movie is about Bette who is a famous performer who is friends with a rich lady Barbara Hershey. They go through their ups and downs as they find out that Barbara has a fatal disease. She isn't married and her child could possibly lose a mother.

Now, Joyce and I are still friends, and I will never forget what this movie had shown to me.
BEACHES, I would recommend it to ppl whose friends have passed away.  To me, this movie cured the 'sickness' when Joyce left.  Now, we both are in P.6, and we still write to each other.  I guess this has helped a lot of people, not just me.

I  particularly loved the way this movie grows with the characters; the story  evolves over much time, and, unfortunately, spends too much time, and the  film's most overrated song (Wind Beneath My Wings, which has a bizarrely  self-involved lyric) in its final half hour wallowing in suds.
