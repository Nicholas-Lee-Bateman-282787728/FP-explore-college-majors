2922510,3,B000RAJZEU,"For anybody who has never seen la Merm strutting her stuff, this is an excellent opportunity to see why she was the toast of Broadway for decades.

But, for fans of the play, this version has been chopped and clipped and cut and sewn into something that barely even resembles ""Anything Goes."" It's a shame that, with each of the versions of the Cole Porter classic, there has yet to be a filmed version of the actual play with the intended songs and dances.

Frank Sinatra sings pleasantly - though his being the love interest of Merman - easily 25+ years his senior - is a little ridiculous. Sheree North as the gangster's moll does a very credible job in another role that has been cut up and blue penciled into oblivion. Bert Lahr is Bert Lahr - yes, that means very funny and very professional.

I'm giving this production three ''s. Really, just one star for the production as a whole. But, it is definitely worth seeing for Ethel Merman's performance. There is nothing like seeing Ethel face forward, plant her feet, and belt to the balcony! She's a real theatrical legend and deserves to be seen.",1301270400,35,1103,4.5606060606060606
2922511,5,B000RAJZEU,"The ""Anything Goes"" from eOne is GREAT! This is the 1954 episode of the Colgate Comedy Hour that featured a much-abridged version of Cole Porter's 1934 Broadway show (later made into a movie and with many revivals on, and off-, Broadway. This ""hour long"" show starred Ethel Merman and Frank Sinatra with Bert Lahr and Sheree North filling out the cast. It was ""Produced"" by Jule Styne.

The show was done live but kinescopes were made and were circulated among collectors in poor condition for many years. After Merman's death, a relative called theatre writer Stephen Cole and said she found Merman's original kinescope print. Its from this print that eOne - and the Archive of American Television produced this DVD. Its in pristine condition!

Like many versions of the musical, other Porter songs are inserted into this production. At least eight full-length versions of ""I Get a Kick out of you"", ""You Do Something to me"", ""All Through the Night"" and the wonderful ""Blow Gabriel Blow"" are here in addition to two versions of the title song. When Lahr was asked to join the cast, he insisted that he and Merman reprise their duet - ""Friendship"" from their run of DuBarry Was A Lady. It's wonderful! As you will hear in the ""bonus interview"" with the show's musical arranger - Buddy Bregman (who was Styne's nephew) - Lahr often flubbed his lines. Look out for when he refers to Merman's character as ""Annie Oakley"" (when her character is Miss Oakley.).

The show is presented here with the commercials deleted, so it only runs 47 minutes. When the show originally aired the director thought that it might run ""over"" so they cut one song. The cast found themselves with four minutes to fill at the end, so we get an impromptu encore!

The ""bonus interview"" I noted above is with Bregman and is not dated - but is apparently fairly recent. It lasts nearly 25 minutes and Bregman does nearly all the talking. He is certainly engaging and has great stories to tell, skipping ahead in school so that he was in college when he was 16 (and living at the Beverly Hills Hotel while attending school. He has some great stories about Judy Garland too! I won't spoil the fun. You need to hear these for yourself.

The set has a nice 20-page booklet with lots of history from Cole. If I had one small complaint it is that the show itself is presented with nine chapter stops but none are at the beginning of the 10 musical numbers. It wouldn't have taken much to index the DVD so that viewers could return to selected performances. But that's not enough to even drop my rating one notch.

This DVD belongs in EVERY American Musical Theatre collection!

I couldn't help but notice that Sinatra seemed a bit overwhelmed at times; maybe he felt uncomfortable playing with that Broadway leviathan.  Perhaps there wasn't quite enough rehearsal time, since Sinatra messes up lyrics now and then.  However, such flaws belong to the days of live tv, and it is wonderful to have still around some of those shows: Julie Andrews in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"", Rod Steiger in Paddy Chayevsky's ""Marty"", the original ""Amahl and the Night Visitors"",  Piper Laurie and Cliff Robertson in ""The Days of Wine and Roses"", to name but a few.",1390003200,,752,4.7984496124031

I became bored with the Bert Lahr shenanigans and Sinatra was never one of my favourites. This version was 'interesting' as a curiosity piece. There is a film version of 'Anything Goes' under another title, from1936 if I correctly recall, which stars a very young Ethel Merman, Bing Crosby and Charlie Ruggles. I have not, as yet, viewed this film version in total but what I have seen of the clips it certainly would appear to be a better bet for your money.

That was when she first did ""Anything Goes"" with Bing Crosby. This made-for-TV production from the '50s has her cast in a role that is now unsuitable for her, and the producers completely wrecked the plot, probably to serve the needs of Sinatra.

small sets. But this really is an Ethel Merman showcase--she gets solo
star billing even over Sinatra--and it is a very valuable preservation
of what Merman was like on stage. Her movies, after all, are films, which
call for a different performing style than Broadway demanded, smaller in

2922566,5,B000RAJZEU,"""Purists"" of Broadway musicals had best look elsewhere for anything resembling a complete and faithful production of Cole Porters song-rich ""Anything Goes.""

This is a remarkable and rare opportunity for the present-day viewer just as it was for an early '50s national television audience to witness the vocal technique of a legendary Broadway star (Ethel Merman, the runaway favorite of composers like Cole Porter and George Gershwin, who trusted her to make every syllable heard above the loudest orchestras) alongside the decade's comeback kid, Frank Sinatra, who was about to take the new long-playing record format ""to the max"" with a repertory of ""Great American Songbook"" numbers extending back to the 1920s but elevated to timelessness by his unique personal interpretations and Nelson Riddle's cutting-edge orchestrations (but not on this performance).

In other words, the show is an unlikely combination of voices (Frank and Ella? Yes!  Ethel and Frank? Maybe--at best.) along with snippets of crisp Broadway choreography plus uneven acting (given the fragment of a script, does it matter?), plus no small number of goofs (poorly lit characters; a flubbed song verse; a movement missed by the camera, etc.); and finally a couple of scintillating performances of Cole's songs (Sinatra's ""All Through the Night"" is a reminder of a wonderful song heard all too infrequently).

Even the ""sinkers"" aren't ""stinkers"" (how can you begrudge Bert Lahr's Lion Man (from ""Wizard of Oz"") stealing the final verse of ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" from Sinatra's mouth?

Above all, this is a moment in time for which modern viewers are only the poorer should they miss it.  Nothing like it will ever be seen again.  This is LIVE TV at its ""livest""--mistakes, warts and all, including ""real"" audience applause (covering actors' lines). It's not the live performance of a polished, rehearsed production but a performance so live that no one--in the production or audience--could know in advance exactly what to expect.

Finally, the episode is sufficient to demonstrate the unstoppable, unflappable, self-contained dynamo that was Ethel Merman, a singer and talent who was a human amplification system, the personification of ""the show must go on"" even if there was no show.  But no less determined was that skinny guy who seemed determined to become the century's most critically acclaimed, all-around best entertainer. He deserves the lion's share of the credit for matching his lungs against Ethel's--though the unrehearsed reprise/curtain call featuring Ethel, Frank and Bert doing ""Anything Goes"" is a hoot: only Ethel knows the words!  (At least Frank is with her on the off-beats while Bert flails his arms to some drumbeat heard only by himself.)

It must be observed that neither Ethel nor Frank had especially noteworthy careers on television.  Ethel was sonically ""too loud"" for the medium.  Frank, too, had an outsized star-image along with an explosive persona that simply went against the soft and warm, fuzzy-sweater images that audiences preferred to see on their smallish 17"" screens.  Sinatra would excell in the 1960s with his periodic ""specials"" featuring him alongside giants like Ella Fitzgerald and Anton Carlos Jobim.  Still, it's hard to reconcile his acceptance of this 1954 television spot opposite (and beneath) Ethel Merman with his subsequent refusal to accept the lead role (opposite Shirley Jones) in the motion picture version of ""Carousel"" (1956).  But as Sinatra was reclaiming the top spot that he had enjoyed as the 1940s' most prominent matinee idol, a mere two years amounted to a huge difference.  In that brief amount of time, he had risen to a position that enabled him to be ""choosy"" about his offers.

2922567,1,B000RAJZEU,It sounded great with a good cast but the execution is so amaturest that it was difficult to watch. Merman is Merman and Sinatra was fine  but the script was terrible and the songs were rewritten for some reason. Maybe to make NBC or the sponsers happy but it sure wasn't Anything Goes. Even the Crosby version was better but not much. It's time to make a new film with the current Broadway script and the original Porter lyrics.,1333152000,,429,4.430379746835443

2922569,1,B000RAJZEU,"Any similarity between the hit broadway show and this Ethel Merman vehicle is purely unintentional. Since it was broadcast in the early days of television I can overlook the tacky sets and cheesy costumes. It follows none of the original story, Porter songs have been inserted willy-nilly and Frank Sinatra looks totally lost and out of place. The idea of Sinatra & Merman as a couple actually turned my stomach. Lyrics have been changed ("".....you're Crosby's salary"". Crosby was not around in the 20s) and Sherri North seems to serve no purpose than to strutt her ""stuff"" and add to the scenery. Bert Lahr may just as well be in his Cowardly Lion costume from ""The Wizard of Oz"" because his shtick has nothing to do with anything.

I thought it was going to be a movie and you stated in the Information that Bind Crosby was in this and he was not. This was a live TV show and it was terrible. The singing was great but everything else was not good. You could see that Frank Sinatra whom I am a great fan of was not comfortable in this show.

2922571,4,B000RAJZEU,"This is a 50-minute TV musical from the 1950s, set in the Roaring Twenties. It's built around Cole Porter songs, some of which are from his 1934 Broadway musical of the same title.

The plot and dialog are radically different from the Broadway original, though there are some common points: it's still a shipboard comedy, Merman again plays a nightclub singer named Reno Sweeney, and there's still a comical gangster named Moonface (played beautifully by Bert Lahr) and a pompous nobleman named Lord Evelyn. But the script was largely new for this TV version.

It's a great cast and the program is fun, as long as you're not expecting the Broadway show. One highlight for theater buffs: Merman and Lahr singing ""Friendship,"" which they originally introduced together in another Porter musical in the 1930s.

The picture and audio quality on this DVD release are a pleasant surprise: they're much clearer than any of the earlier video releases I've seen of this live broadcast.",1308614400,10,976,4.975460122699387

8213783,2,B000RAJZEU,"Review of Anything Goes
Hot Toasty Rag, September 13, 2017

Anyone, even a musical lover, will tell you that Anything Goes is a pretty silly story. A bunch of colorful characters are stuck on a boat together, and while he loves her and she loves someone else, and shes marrying that guy, and hes pretending to be someone elsewell, its a hodge podge of musical comedy interrupted by Cole Porter standards and some tap dancing.

While Ethel Merman starred in the original Anything Goes on Broadway in 1934, she reprised her role for Hollywood in 1936, with Bing Crosby by her side. Almost twenty years later, she made a live television adaptation, this time with Frank Sinatra. Two years after that, in 1956, Hollywood ditched Ethel but kept Bing and made another filmed version! Anyway, the 1954 version was severely condensed to fit into a television event on Colgate Comedy Hour. While the plot is pretty truncated, I don't think anyone is really watching it for the dialogue. Theyre watching it to see Frank Sinatra and Ethel Merman sing live versions of Anything Goes, I Get a Kick Out of You, Youre the Top, and Blow Gabriel Blow. The two stars didn't get along, and its pretty obvious when you watch it that they have zero chemistry together, but if youd like to see them performing live, you can give it a watch. Its only an hour long.",1505260800,,1341,4.630252100840337

It is a condensed version of the original, done on live TV with low-budget sets, some flubbed lines and commercials. While it is kind of cool to watch Sinatra, the show as a whole is a dud if you want to see Anything Goes in its entirety.",1497744000,,359,4.142857142857143

8213788,2,B000RAJZEU,"I was very disappointed, this is the old NBC Colgate variety hour production of ""Anything goes"" not the broadway one and I was totally bummed. I managed 22 minutes and then turned it off. I have to learn to read the descriptions better.",1484179200,2,236,4.511627906976744
