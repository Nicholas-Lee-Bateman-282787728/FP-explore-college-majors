I gotta say, it was one of my most favorite VHS videos of all time.

(Though what REALLY stinks is I've got the theme song stuck in my head.  "".... how do they build that, build that, building so high, how do they build that bridge so wide.....""  and I CANNOT find the full lyrics for it nor even the name of the song.  If anyone DOES have a copy of the tape and does find the name of the song, I will be in your debt forever.)",1410307200,,509,3.7641509433962264
8275964,5,6304199473,"I'm pretty fussy about which TV/videos I'll let my 3-year-old watch, but this one's clearly worth it.  He loves it and I think he'll continue to be intrigued for years.  Okay, it may be a little corny, but also has fascinating content for all ages.  I showed it to a 15-year-old recently, who also enjoyed it.  I have similar comments about the Popular Mechanics spaceships video.  I'm planning to buy a couple more in the series.",1055030400,,430,4.605263157894737
