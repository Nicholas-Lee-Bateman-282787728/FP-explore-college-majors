1197207,5,B000009CLV,"Really a good film for a RKO release, this also has a All Star Cast:
Frank Sinatra, Jack Haley, Victor Borge, a very young Mel Torme, Mary Wikes, and more. Very entertaining, and a sweet love story. Very New Yorker Theme movie..",1247097600,,228,4.4523809523809526
1197208,3,B000009CLV,"I watched part of this fun film on TCM early this morning, and missed the opening titles.  Was Oscar, the piano player, Oscar Peterson, the well known jazz musician?  He had a speaking role, unusual for a Black actor/musician in 1943.",1229040000,,234,4.682926829268292
1197209,1,B000009CLV,"Mr KILLIAN is quite right about TIM WHELAN. I wouldn't blame RKO for the failure of that movie who had enough money for a cheap screenplay(Jay Dratler and Ray Spence) RKO had paid 15000 dollars for the rights of the Rodgers and Hart musical, a flop in 1940. Only one song was kept and Adamson-Mc Hugh were paid for four new songs. No question about money there. Whelan was also producer on that one. The cinematography by Robert de Grasse was good, as usual.
But Leon Errol does his Leon Errol thing. Victor Borge plays the piano, as Borge is expected to do. Haley plays Haley. Sinatra plays himself, so there is no character in the movie. He looks over made up and very tired, and just sings not so good songs. Our own Michle Morgan looks old and not attractive. The Edward Stevenson gowns even look without style.
Only Marcy Mc Guire, as a servant chasing Sinatra is her usual dynamic self.
It is really too bad as the beginning looks promising: a song around the kitchen table by all the servants, and the same for another song in the dining hall. Then everything and everybody falls asleep.
The DVD transfer is very good, as all the Sinatra transfers in the box (the best being IT HAPPENED IN BROOKLYN) The DVDs are inexpensive and there is no chapters list in the box, which is now usual. Unfortunately there is no list either on the DVD, which is a bad move for a musical.",1226534400,,1378,4.429133858267717
1197210,5,B000009CLV,"This movie is awesome. If you love romance and musicals, you should add this to your AMC movie collection.",1220832000,,106,4.631578947368421
1197211,4,B000009CLV,"I absolutely love this movie. Sinatra is too sweet and too flippin' adorable for words! It's hilarious watching him play himself in a film, where only one or two other characters recognize that he's not just another ""singing hack."" The songs are classics - ""I Couldn't Sleep a Wink Last Night,"" ""The Music Stopped,"" ""I Saw You First,"" and ""Lovely Way to Spend an Evening"" are all top-notch examples of Sinatra's early singing style - lush orchestrations and an irresistibly romantic delivery. While this is definitely not the best musical ever filmed, it's one of my favorites from RKO. It's filled with a slew of well-known actors, among them Mary Wickes (always hilarious) and a very young Mel Torme. My favorite actor sightings in the cast have to be a young Barbara Hale (a.k.a. Della Street on the Perry Mason show) and Victor Borge of all people (he was actually kind of dashing back in the day!). Frank really doesn't get a chance to stretch his acting chops in this movie (his first starring role), but his singing more than compensates for any lack in the acting experience department. The movie provides great documentation of how and why Sinatra made bobbysoxers swoon in the 1940s. My one quip with the storyline (*spoiler*!) is that Frank is turned down for Jack Haley, a.k.a. THE TIN MAN from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000ADS63K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. That's absolutely insane! :P The DVD doesn't have chapter selections, but the picture is crisp and clear and sounds great. The film is sweet and funny and a great document of a young Sinatra at work.",1213315200,2,1713,5.324723247232472
1197212,4,B000009CLV,"If this weren't Frank Sinatra's first film it might better be remembered as another sprarkler from the Hollywood pro Tim Whelan, who made dozens of great films in the 1930s and 1940s.  He started out in Indiana, then in Hollywood worked as Harold Lloyd's gofer on several of the comedian's silent films.  His great learning curve came after his relocation to the UK in the early 1930s, where his expertise with sound film was desperately needed by a foundering British film industry.  In short time he was one of the most sought after men working behind the camera.

Whelan directed the stunning version of George Eliot's THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, with Geraldine Fitzgerald and James Mason as the doomed brother and sister, long before either went to Hollywood.  He worked with Olivier on several movies, including Q PLANES and THE DIVORCE OF LADY X with Merle Oberon, and gave us Vivien Leigh, Charles Laughton and Rex Harrison in THE STREETS OF LONDON, and many more.  He is even co-credited for the work he did on THE THIEF OF BAGDAD, though today most of us consider it a Michael Powell film.  Indeed, it has been Whelan's fate to stand totally in the shadow of such directors as Hitchcock, Powell, Anthony Asquith and a host of others, yet his slate of British films is second to none.  Perhaps one of the reasons for his relative obscurity is his refusal to be pigeonholed.  He could direct comedy, drama, thrillers, ""action,"" melodrama, so-called  ""women's pictures,"" and the outright farce.  In the USA he only broadened his reach, extending his oeuvre to musicals, although RKO's paltry budgets sometimes hampered his good efforts.  Still, there is gold in them there hills, and maybe one of these days we will get a complete Whelan retrospective.  He made many fascinating films (why, even his misfires are worth watching), and if HIGHER AND HIGHER isn't the best, it has some wonderful character work and some smooth transitions between different planes of farce.  Like Mitchell Leisen, Whelan was an expert at combining otherwise irreconciliable elements; in any other movie Sinatra might have been an excrescence shoehorned in at the insistence the boys at the front office.  Here he's perfectly blended in, like vermouth in a Martini, the whole concoction perfectly smooth.

It is sort of odd the way Sinatra is married off to Della Street.  Made for each other?  I don't think so, but it adds to the film's goofy charm.",1130198400,3,2431,4.859223300970874

1197216,3,B000009CLV,"Pretty light fare, but entertaining mostly for the young Sinatra.  Frankly the Michele Morgan and Jack Haley romance doesn't work too well and they would've been better to take a splash and given Sinatra the romantic lead too.",1405814400,,226,4.947368421052632
1197217,4,B000009CLV,I enjoyed this movie very much. It was entertainment. No bad words and with something for the imagination. It was mostly upbeat with a good ending. And my uncle was in it.,1389312000,,171,4.375
1197218,4,B000009CLV,"A musical with a wacky story line that includes some now-classic tunes sung by both Frank Sinatra, then 28, and Mel Torme, then 18!  I purchased the DVD to see what Mel's film debut was.  It turned out that it was Frank's debut too.  You also get Victor Borge.  Fun!",1385251200,,266,4.26
1197219,5,B000009CLV,"What a fun, well-cast movie.  From beginning to end, the dialogue, facial expressions and body language are priceless, making this a comedy classic.  The music is also exceptional and it is wonderful to own a copy of Frank Sinatra's acting career debut!!",1381363200,,254,5.023809523809524
1197220,4,B000009CLV,"This is one of the first two films made by Frank Sinatra (the other was Step Lively) for RKO in 1944. Sinatra was then at the height of his singing career in the Tommy Dorsey and Axel Stordahl era (his fame declined in the late 1940s only to rise again in the 1950s thanks to Capitol Records arrangers Nelson Riddle and Billy May). So in this film he had little to do except sing a few numbers as himself - five of the eight songs by Jimmy McHugh (mus.) and Harold Adamson (lyr.) in the score. His principal co-star was Barbara Hale, whose career also resurged as Perry Mason's secretary Della Street on T.V.

The title of the film was borrowed from a poor 1940 Broadway musical by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, but there were no Rodgers and Hart numbers in this reworking. The plot here (I use the term loosely!) was still based on the same book as the Broadway show by Joshua Logan and Gladys Hurlbut, with amendments. It's a sort of Cinderella or Eliza Doolittle story with a scullery maid (Michele Morgan) being transformed into a debutante. The best-known of the McHugh and Adamson numbers were `I couldn't sleep a wink last night', `This is a lovely way to spend an evening' and `The music stopped'. As long as you're not too stuffy about these things, there's also an upbeat version of Boccherini's famous minuet.

Also of interest in this film: there are appearances by Victor Borge, Mel Torme (at the start of his career leading the Meltones vocal group for Artie Shaw), Mary Wickes (the long-suffering maid in the Doris Day/Gordon Macrae musicals and in the Father Dowling TV series) and Dooley Wilson. A very enjoyable frothy 75 min entertainment.",1345075200,,1661,4.627118644067797
1197221,5,B000009CLV,A song brought this movie to mind so I thought I would check Amazon.  Again they did not disappoint.  This movie would be shown on TV many times a year but no longer.  I thought I would never see this movie again.  Quality is very good. I love this movie -- it's funny and the music is great.,1324080000,,292,3.9827586206896552
1197222,5,B000009CLV,"How tired I am of watching so many of the present day movies that are so ugly, perverted and twisted and making no sense, oh those writers!  Go back to the days when people cared for each other and were happy to sing and dance and love...not lust. Oh how much you young people have missed..so sad. This movie showed Sinatra at his Loving Innocence and his voice was the same, Beautiful & Sweet. The storyline was interesting and had a lot of cute scenes. No it's not a Gone with the wind but Sinatra sings his beautiful Heart out and what a wonderful trip back in time..no, as they say, they don't make musicals like this anymore, not in this world.",1285027200,3,649,4.319672131147541
7905354,3,B000009CLV,"Review of Higher and Higher
Hot Toasty Rag, September 13, 2017

A very rich man in a big, beautiful house with lots of servants is broke. He cant afford his big, beautiful house, and he hasn't paid his servants in months. Collectively, the servants come up with the idea to pass off a maid, Michele Morgan, as their bosss daughter, since his real daughter is abroad in Europe, and then to marry her off to a rich man to save the household. The problem is that Michele is in love with the valet, Jack Haley. He doesnt know shes alive, but their singing neighbor next door, Frank Sinatrawho actually plays himselfsure notices her!

Its very silly, but there are some cute songs and funny jokes, and the romances are very entertaining. As silly and corny as this movie is, I actually liked Higher and Higher. Just make sure you're in the mood for that combination before you rent this black-and-white musical.  The cast works well off each other and the plot is very funny. Plus, its cute to see a very young Frank Sinatra, but don't expect any acting chops on him yet; all he does in this one is sing.",1505260800,,1099,4.45771144278607

7905358,5,B000009CLV,"The plot is outrageous but not important in this funny, sensitive, charming movie, the likes of which will never be reproduced again.  The actors are superb, the humor original and hilarious, the music enjoyable, and ending satisfying.  What more could you want?  Jack Haley is blind to the doe eyes of Michelle Morgan, but everyone else knows she adores him.  It is a unique blend of humor, mistaken identity, and all the other ingredients of the screwball comedies plus early forties crooning of Sinatra.",1476921600,,506,4.988095238095238
