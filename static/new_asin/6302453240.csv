470603,5,6302453240,"This documentary was made back in 1992, and does a very good job of detailing the history of MGM. Part one starts in 1924 with the opening of the studio in 1924 and and ends with the death of wonder boy Irving G. Thalberg in 1936. Part two concentrates on what are considered ""the golden years"" from 1936 to 1946. Part three is about the decline of the studio after 1946. Patrick Stewart narrates, and there are some particularly interesting although not surprising revelations, such as Helen Hayes describing studio head Louis B. as a gentle yet evil person.

I guess I enjoyed part one the most because I really disagree about 1936-1946 being MGM's peak years. I think they were at their best from 1924 up to shortly after the death of Irving Thalberg. His foresight and creativity are what fueled the silent film and early sound projects that really put the studio on the map. At any rate, if you enjoyed the much shorter ""Universal Horror"" documentary on the Carl Laemmle years of Universal Studios, you'll enjoy this one too. Highly recommended.",1224288000,18,1050,4.706521739130435

470608,5,6302453240,This documentary is utterly breathtaking. A fine tribute to the rise and fall of Louis B. Mayer's epic film empire. Curiously little is said about Samuel Goldwyn who who was a major player in the studio and instrumental in it's early years.  Another issue is the documentary gives little coverage to the bitter labor stuggles MGM had with leftist union agitators who often targeted the studio.,1135987200,4,393,4.954545454545454

""Breaking Glass""-no DVD except in England.

""The Hanging Tree""-no DVD. Gary Coopers best?

""Resurrection""-no DVD. Ellen Burstyn's best?

""Rich Man Poor Man""no DVD except in England. For God's sake this was a major AMERICAN mini-series! I could go on.

You can walk through any Blockbuster and see 90% garbage released on DVD but many of the classics (so maybe the Hazel O'Conner movie, Breaking Glass, wasn't a classic but it was damn good) have never been released on DVD.

And of course, as has always been the case, the degraded sound, vision, and longevity of tape costs twice as much as a DVD.

So I defer and will wait until someone offers this series on DVD. At that time I will be the first in line!",1133222400,4,903,4.403614457831325
470610,5,6302453240,"Better than any tour available MGM When The Lion Roars takes you back in time and see the roots rise and lamentable downfall of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. The presentation of the film is perfect using a series of film clips, outtakes, archival footages and  interviews as it will take you behind the scenes to see why MGM was once a legendary movie studio whose venerable roar brought us screen classics and all those lavish technicolor musicals. An added bonus is that MGM filmed some of their films using the exterior of their studio so you get to see some of the studio's landmarks (notably the Thalberg Building and the colonnade), the two backlots and an overview of the MGM Studios at its height.

This collection is perfect for classic film buffs, movie historians and those people of who wants to see a glimpse of Hollywood's golden years or curious of what MGM used to be since MGM has long been converted into a hotel company, although it still continued its movie operations, it is no longer a major player in Hollywood.

Hosted by Patrick Stewart (of Star Trek Fame) each tape focuses on a different era  spanning 7 decades of the studio's glorious history. A brief summary;

Part One - The Lion's Roar (1924-1936)

This era feautres the genesis of MGM- from the silent era to its successful transition to sound to the untimely death of Irving G. Thalberg.

Part Two - The Lion Reigns Supreme (1936-1946)

The big MGM productions, the family oriented films, to wartime America and the Golden Age of MGM musicals.

Part Three - The Lion In Winter (1946-1986)

The downfall of MGM, the firing of Louis B. Mayer the emergence of television, the decline of the studio system, Kirk Kerkorian who single handidly butchered the studio, its transition from a movie studio to a hotel company and Ted Turner.",1117497600,8,1812,4.76038338658147

I am a technical person and appreciated the stories behind the screens.  Motion pictures have to go thru a lot of competition against other entertainment medias.  The biggest one was television.  Color films, Cinemascope and Stereo Sound were the answers made by the film industry to the new television sets.  Some film actors were able to withstand the transitions and some were not able to change.  I heard that Charles Chaplin was paid a salary of $10,000 per week (he was both a director and actor) when the admission to most theatres were 5 cents a person.  People crave entertainment.

470744,4,6302453240,"This is a documentary that presents, in a very stylish way reminiscent of golden era MGM productions, the history of the studios through it's movies and personalities both on and off the camera.  The production itself is almost too distracting.

Despite the 6 hour running time, viewers should be aware that they are going to get as much about the office politics as about the movies that were made.  As a consequence, all of their favorite films may not get covered to the degree that they would like.  This is more about the overall business of making movies, rather than in depth reporting on the technique of any particular film or artist.

We also do not get the early history of Metro Pictures, nor of Sam Goldwyn Studios, that were merged by Loew's under Louis Mayer in 1924.  The storyline ends with the acquisition by Ted Turner of a company burdened with so much debt that he kept the film library, sold back the name, and turned over the studio facilities that were left to Lorimar Tele-Pictures.  (This documentary was produced by Turner Entertainment.)

This is still rewarding to get through, though you might want to watch over several nights.",1360800000,,1158,4.755

470748,5,6302453240,"This documentary remains the DEFINITIVE study of the rise and fall of Hollywood's greatest dream factory - Metro Goldwyn Mayer.  Hosted and narrated by Patrick Stewart, film lovers will enjoy the generously-packed clips and insightful interviews with surviving stars.  We're lucky to have the inclusion of Freddie Bartholomew (""David Copperfield""), for example, who sadly passed away shortly after his participation.

The main drawcard, for many, will be the interviews.  For example, it's fascinating to hear the stars' differing views of studio head Louis B. Mayer.  Some absolutely adored him (Mickey Rooney, June Allyson); whilst Helen Hayes quite calmly describes him as ""evil"".  Esther Williams is even more cutting (the ""uneducated"" son of a ""trash-cart"" tycoon who used ""intimidation"" to get what he wanted out of his stars).  When Mayer was ousted in favour of up-and-coming producer Dore Schary, the gloss of the ""classic"" MGM, for all it was worth, exited with him.

You'll witness the studio's beginnings in the silent era, through the industrious war years, the glorious era of the ""MGM musicals""; and finally the last great gasps of the lion as the company was sold off to a Las Vegas hotel chain in the 1970's.  In between, there are TONNES of clips and classic moments from the films in question, and candid remembrances from the stars, plus those on the other side of the camera.  For my money, this is still the one-stop port of call when it comes to classic movie documentaries.  Endlessly fascinating.  Six hours of classic movie heaven!",1283731200,,1557,5.1106719367588935

470750,5,6302453240,"For the first time viewer who enjoys anything historical, ""When the Lion Roars"" is a superb documentary about the growth of Hollywood as an entertainment capital, through the eyes of its largest movie maker, Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Actor, Patrick Stewart hosts and narrates the rise of the MGM lion in one lavish costume after another with an overly lavish set that is supposed to project the glittering image of the movies as a growth industry. His commanding baritone does the rest.

MGM becomes a reality in 1924 after a merger with Loew, a theater owner, and the hire of a genius who would be dubbed the Boy Wonder--Irving Thalberg--a sickly fellow who suffers his first heart attack at 26. This was the age of the silent film and the story dutifully records the demise of stars whose voices did not meet audience expectations, and measures the rise of new ones under films that debuted at the rate of one per week with Thalberg as producer who was known for his ability to select topics and genre that would become box office successes.

Like the baseball player who could be traded, the stars of the day were under contract to Louis B. Mayer making appearances where required and receiving weekly paychecks. Patrick Stewart takes us through many stars, their temperment and pecadillos that were a rage on screen and off. By the second disk in this set, the glory of MGM starts to go downhill with the advent of television, the death of its foremost producer, divestiture of movie theaters by consent decree, corporate in-fighting and a more finicky post-war audience. This was the most difficult one to watch because it goes into detail about the end of an era.

As noted in earlier reviews, clips of Fred Astaire were deleted, but so were nude and sexually provocative scenes that led to the Legion of Decency. (I'm a very visual person)! And I felt that too much time was spent on Judy Garland. Nevertheless, it was interesting to learn how one actress detested the love scenes with her leading man, and was rumored to chew on a piece of garlic before every one of them. Interviews with actors and actresses are excellent.

This is a worthwhile experience to learn about the studio that had more stars than where in the heavens. It is also entertaining and informative. It is about a studio that made movies for profit but also as Ars Gratia, Artis--art for art's sake.

You should at least see it before it's gone with the wind.",1273536000,3,2434,4.690866510538641
470751,4,6302453240,"I was lucky enough to see this documentary when it first aired on TNT in the early '90s. I never bought the VHS set, but after reading a wonderful new biography about Irving Thalberg decided to get When the Lion Roars on DVD. However, I was disappointed to find out that some footage was cut from the second part. The first part ends with the death of Irving Thalberg in 1936, and originally the second part starts ""the day after"" Thalberg's funeral. But the DVD's second part starts with The Wizard of Oz and Judy Garland. This wouldn't be so bad, except that Jean Harlow's death has been eliminated. I'm sure that other parts were cut as well, it's just I don't remember them like I remember Harlow's demise. Jean was a huge star and she is still a fan favorite almost 80 years after her death. Shame on Time Warner for snipping away this documentary's tribute to Jean!",1269302400,2,871,4.484276729559748
470752,5,6302453240,"MGM: When The Lion Roars is an extremely well done two DVD documentary about MGM hosted and narrated by Patrick Stewart. The two DVDs tell the story of the birth of the company, its rise and benefit from the ""studio system"" and the ""star system,"" its heyday and the company's slow but sadly inescapable decline beginning in the late 1940s/early 1950s as government rules ended the studio system, TV competed for their audiences and much more. The documentary proceeds at a very good pace and film buffs will not be bored! The archival footage from both the old MGM movies and the MGM ""get-togethers"" for MGM stars is very well done and these add to the artistic value of the documentary. I love the interview footage we get from stars like Van Johnson, June Allyson and George Murphy, too. We also learn about power struggles within the company as egos clashed and people with honest disagreements fought; we get quite a bit of information about Louis B. Mayer, Irving Thalberg, other MGM big wigs and Nicholas Schenck who was president of Loew's Inc. in New York, the parent company of MGM.

I particularly enjoyed the segments of the documentary that are devoted to one major MGM star at a time along with any remarkable movies in which they starred. For example, we get a fantastic segment on Judy Garland along with footage of her in ""The Wizard of Oz"" and even some of her other films as well. They also have a wonderful segment on the great Clark Gable and his role in ""Gone With The Wind;"" this is so well done and the rest of the segments are so nicely presented that it's bound to warm your heart.

On the second DVD there is the end of part two of the documentary; and we also have the third and final installment of the film. The final installment does an excellent job of finishing up the depiction of MGM's glory days especially as a studio that could make superlative musicals including ""Singing In The Rain"" and ""An American In Paris;"" the film clips throughout are incredible and the interview footage we get with Vincente Minnelli is fantastic. Then we see how MGM fell from its lofty position with actors leaving at the end of their contracts--Nicholas Schenck in charge at Loews's back in New York thought that the MGM office in California was simply spending too much money. Sadly, to some extent Nicholas Schenck was right. MGM starts to lose money and they stop turning out one full length feature film per week which had always been one of their many claims to fame. Under Dore Schary, Louis B. Mayer was eventually let go by Nicholas Schenck despite the fact that people sometimes cringed at Schary's ""message pictures."" Of course, the studio also lost steam because people were staying home to watch television. The documentary also shows us the effects of directors wanting more creative power and Kirk Kerkorian buying MGM so that he could essentially demolish it and sell the picture library to Ted Turner.

In short, this is an outstanding and rather comprehensive documentary about MGM, one of the greatest Hollywood motion picture studios that ever was or ever will be. I highly recomemnd this two DVD documentary for film buffs and fans of the actors of the glory days of MGM. In addition, newcomers who want a springboard to start learning about the old Hollywood movie making system and MGM will find this to be a fine place to start.",1247529600,2,3368,4.676222596964587

470782,2,6302453240,"This documentary about the history of Hollywood's premiere dream factory--MGM--is good for someone wanting to learn what all the fuss was about when MGM ruled the dream factories.  Yet, I was greatly dissapointed in what the documentary didn't include--and that's at least a few frames of the golden silent gods and goddesses who put MGM on the map during the Roaring Twenties.  I wanted to see something about Mae Murray, voted the number one female movie star in the world, for several years. There was nothing about Barbara LaMarr--The Woman Who Was Too Beautiful--another world famous star.  William Haines was also a Number One Box Office Star for several years. None of them received even a frame of footage. The documentary also included several worn-out sequences that we've all seen over and over again--Judy Garland singing ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" from Wizard of Oz...Judy singing ""Dear Mr. Gable"".

Then there were other worn-out sequences--from ""Gigi,"" ""An American in Paris,"" etc.  This documentary is entertaining in many ways but it could have been more fascinating, again, if we were given fresh, never-before--seen footage of other MGM greats who put this fabulous studio on the map during its early history.",1235433600,13,1230,5.191919191919192
470783,4,6302453240,"I first discovered ""MGM: When the Lion Roars"" on PBS about 5 years ago. Even then I only saw part of the documentary- and out of order, the last section first. I didn't know how much detail of the MGM history it actually covered until I saw the complete, 3-part documentary on Turner Classic Movies 18 months ago. When I finally digested even part one, I was flabbergasted. The documentary, lovingly narrated by Patrick Stewart, starts at the beginning (to coin a phrase from one of MGM's great fantasy films). We see the formation of Metro, Goldwyn, and Louis B. Mayer's ""Mayer,"" starting from 1924 and the silent film ""He Who Gets Slapped."" We see the union of the brilliant young Irving Thalberg and Mayer as they concoct a bona-fide production factory- replete with school, hospital, police force, fire department, and commissary. The New York stockholders (headed by Marcus Lowe, later by Nicholas Schenck) are the magnates who actually oversee MGM, as well as the theaters who distribute the films made by MGM. And part 1 introduces MGM's first stars: Garbo, Gilbert, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery, Marie Dressler, Helen Hayes, the Barrymores, Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Norma Shearer Thalberg, and the studio logo- the MGM lion. Remembrances by many of MGM's staff- including Samuel Marx, King Vidor, William Tuttle, and Margaret Booth- give a no-holes-barred outline of just how the studio made (and in some instances broke) their stars.

A lot of the veterans interviewed seem almost hypnotic in their praise of the factory and the tyrannical Mayer- which is curious because there are a few pointed recollections by actors (including double-Oscar winner Luise Rainier and swimming star Esther Williams) who did not particularly care for the bullying, manipulative showman- a man not above fainting on cue to get what he wanted, or reminding his contractors that they were his property to do with as he liked. Part 1 ends with the untimely death of 37-year-old Thalberg, and part 2 dives into the 1940's and the war years when Mayer decrees wholesome, pious, family-oriented film only. The child stars are introduced: Jackie Cooper, Mickey Rooney, June Preisser, Freddie Bartholomew, and most of all, Judy Garland (given a particularly long testimony by Rooney, who then curiously denies that MGM held and responsiblity- even in part- for her substance addiction). A sobering begins to creep into the dream factory as stars- particularly the females- are unceremoniously dropped (or at least not picked up) as they begin to age. The new contractors- Lamarr, Allyson, Van Johnson, Greer Garson, James Stewart, Elizabeth Taylor, Tracy & Hepburn- are introduced. A lot of MGM's male stars enlist and fight in the war, which annoys Mayer (of course) to no end. Producer Dore Schary (Mayer's political and spiritual opposite) is brought into the fold as ""a new Thalberg,"" thought to improve movie quality while paring the ascending film costs and tolerate the emergence of the new medium of television.

Finally, MGM's legendary musicals make up a significant part of Act 3. One of the most pointed revelations is the contrast in musical film styles between sophisticated Arthur Freed and schmaltzy, sentimental Joe Pasternak (and they're absolutely right). The 1950's arrive and Mayer's 20-year feud with boss Schenck reaches an unimaginable climax when an ""office coup"" of sorts terminates Mayer from his own studio- replaced by Schary, who puts an end to all the sweetness and virtuosity and concentrates on gritty message dramas. Many wonderful, stupendous film clips are shown- but amazingly, none of dancer Fred Astaire in the DVD release. (Despite having made some of the greatest musical films from 1948 to 1957- it appears that his widow holds the release rights to all his images, decreeing license fees for the use of his image. Consequently she had all his footage removed from this documentary, which is unforgivable.) The studio shifts management several times in the next dozen or so years, until the factory is more or less liquidated in 1974 and turned over to the MGM Grand Hotel project of Kirk Kerkorian. A particularly sad image is seeing the MGM sign removed from the executive office building in 1986. But what a time it once was.",1235088000,8,4254,5.075714285714286

Beginning with the inception of MGM, a merger of Metro Studios, Sam Goldwyn Studios, and L.B. Mayer Pictures, the story takes us magically from one era to another as we view clips from classic films and watch and hear interviews from some of its most famous stars, directors, and others who  were instrumental in creating the MGM look. Especially commendable is Samuel Marx, who provides the link from start to finish: he was there, and his behind-the-scenes stories are nothing short of fantastic. This is no hack job; When the Lion Roars is a sumptuous retelling of one of the most amazing stories in Hollywood history.",1234569600,3,819,4.978102189781022

470806,5,6302453240,"There has never been a more fascinating TV program for movie lovers than MGM: When The Lion Roars (despite that title).  One thing that has always puzzled me though:  In the second part Jackie Cooper is talking about his short subject ""The Christmas Party"" (1930).  I saw Clark Gable and a lot of other MGM stars in there but suddenly out of the blue a very young Bette davis shows up.  I always thought that Davis NEVER worked in the early days at Metro, only Warners and Universal.

This program is well worth watching for the often hilarious comments made by Cooper and by the glorious Freddie Bartholomew.  I had NEVER seen the latter ever give an interview and once you get over the shock of seeing him as an old man, you'll really appreciate his wit.  I also loved Luise Rainer, William Tuttle, and Maureen O'Sullivan.  Thank God that Ted Turner did this before most of these folks (like Freddie and Sam Marx died).  And Rainer is still going strong at 99. Her comments about L.B Mayer are priceless as are Cooper's about Wally Beery.

470807,3,6302453240,"Back when TNT aired this series in the early 90's, it was one of the best documentary series that was produced.  However, almost immediately after its broadcast, Robin Astaire (Fred's wife) forbade the usage of any of his clips on ANY documentary, suggesting that his image in such capacity will ruin his integrity- or a facsimile there of.  So, when issued on Laserdisc in the 90's, all the Astaire sequences were either cut or replaced- i.e., the clip from Ziegfeld Follies, the Babbit and the Bromide number with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly was replaced with Judy Garland's The Great Lady Has An interview.  The version released on the DVD, unfortunately, is still that one.  While TCM aired the series right before the DVD release, it was indeed the original version with Fred Astaire intact- you can either keep both, or just keep the TCM recording, since it would be more complete... such a pity for a great documentary.",1232755200,102,926,4.80503144654088

470809,5,6302453240,"Indeed MGM was the Tiffany's of the old classic movies studios of Hollywood. The studio was known for it's superb craftsmanship in creating films for the masses that were jewels of popular entertainment. Other studios in town each had their specialties, Universal had its monster movies, and Warmer's had the gritty hardboiled edge with its gangster films and social epics. Twentieth Century Fox had musicals mixed in with its films that dealt with social problems; Paramount had C.B. DeMille and glittering comedies. What set MGM apart was its Stars; more than there are in the heavens. MGM more than any other studio was responsible for Hollywood glamour of the Golden Age, for great musicals that no other studio could match. Family films and adventures with great heroes like Gable and Tracy. Epics like nothing we will ever see again and wonderful dramas from Broadway brought to the screen in the 50's and 60's. MGM was all of this and much more. It was the stuff of our collective dreams.
  This documentary covers the glittering history of the studio with tons of great clips and behind the scene footage. And many of the stars of its golden age share their reminiscences ranging from wistfully sweet to the bitter and amusing.  Patrick Stewart is a fine host who guides us through the decades. This is a must have for any fan of movies, film buffs will love it, and for anyone just discovering the history of Hollywood with will open doors you never even dreamed existed to a world of astonishing entertainment. No there will never be a studio like MGM again, nor the stars it created. It is only a golden dream now, a dream that is gone with the wind.",1232323200,4,1661,4.720689655172414
