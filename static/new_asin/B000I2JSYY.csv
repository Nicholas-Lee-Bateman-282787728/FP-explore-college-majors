8143752,3,B000I2JSYY,"I found this DVD to be quite good, an excellent collection from a TV series that has not been seen in decades.  The quality of the images and sound is a definite improvement from my earlier DVD's that I've bought in the various local dollar stores.  For my money, I think it's definitely worth it.",1199404800,3,297,4.381818181818182
8143753,1,B000I2JSYY,"This is yet ANOTHER incomplete copy of the popular Ronald Howard/H Marion Crawford 1954 Series that has been released ""IN ITS ENTIRETY"" by Mill Creek and that I bought elsewhere (but is now available here for only a few bucks more than this set).  Why do these inexpensive labels keep trying to up each other, when 1 manufacturer has finally done us the favor of putting out all 39 episodes on an inexpensive 5 disc set?  Buy the Mill Creek set and get the whole series (see my review for its good and bad aspects) at once, and let's tell these dvd manufacturers who don't have the guts to kick the extra point what they can do with their incomplete editions.  Sorry for the cruel tone folks, but I'm sure die hard fans of this short lived imported series will agree with me.",1160784000,9,775,4.405594405594406
