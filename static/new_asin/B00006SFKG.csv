Yes its an interesting documentary but can you imagine how the victims family felt knowing the images of their loved one being violently stabbed were being shown to people? Personally, I think you've got to have a strong stomach to watch it.",1144368000,9,418,4.2375
1793231,1,B00006SFKG,"I saw this recently and was to say the least, very disturbed by the video surveilence of Kell KILLING Blackmon. It is a very sad true life story of one very disturbed individual.

Troy Kell comes from Nevada, he has, now, no life..he has not had one since he was 17. He was incarcerated for a BRUTAl murder of a Man who was ""stalking and harrassing"" his childhood friend, ""Sandy"".

He committeda brutal crime, shot a man 6 (SIX) times in the head at close range. This documentary shows the real inside of prison life, allbeit through the eyes of a very disturbed young individual. Kell is articulate and comes across as highly intelligent. But is he really?, he is now on Death Row.

Very good documentary but also very disturbing.",1119225600,10,731,4.564885496183206

1793234,5,B00006SFKG,"Troy Kell is very charming, intelligent, .... yet also A cold blooded killer.  It is a very realistic look into the US prison system.  The death in this movie, is hard to watch- you'll be blown away that it was allowed to contuine for so long.

1793235,4,B00006SFKG,"A shocking look at crime and punishment. Never before has there been a documentary so real and graphic in its look at prison life. Troy Kell, the assailant, killed a black prisoner in a Utah prison in 1995. The attack was caught on tape, and depicts the horrific stabbing of the prisoner by Kell. What's perhaps just as fascinating is that Kell is an articulate, intelligent, smooth talking young man who could just as easily have become a doctor, lawyer or something comparable. But ultimately we realize that Kell is one thing -- a natural born killer. A fascinating piece.",1048204800,10,575,4.76

Frankly, I don't give a damn if they are kept in cages and are only given food and water.  Many of the cable stations broadcast Prison ""Soaps"" daily.  The shock value of their crimes and their lifes behind bars has become every day drama, and soooooooooo repetitive.

I didn't find this documentary exceptional in any way.",1262304000,,450,4.792207792207792

As someone that was placed in an adult prison at age fifteen, I can relate to a lot that Troy says about being a man and standing up for your self. What I disagree with is that the murder was racially motivated. Someone that hasn't done serious time will never understand that it was mutually agreed between his victim and Troy that one of them had to die. It's just that Troy was more devious and effective. He would have done the same to a white opponent that challenged him. His reference to the guards about watch this act referred to his testimony at the trial not the apology to the victim's family. A real convict does not give an apology unless he means it. That was an act of respect.",1240185600,7,855,5.202898550724638

1793308,4,B00006SFKG,"I am always a sucker for a good prison story and this DVD definitely manages to present an intense and grim real-life story of a young man who managed to screw his life by getting a life-time prison sentence and then proceed to ""shank"" another inmate to his bloody death.

Along with the actual story I really enjoyed viewing the prison riot scenes that truly shows how tense and dangerous prison life can be. Some of the interview subjects, such as the D.A. guy, I found to be a little irritating and boring.

Anatomy of a Prison Murder is an intense and involving story that presents the dire realities of prison life and how one young man chose to take the darkest route to the pits of prison hell.",1225411200,2,701,4.426356589147287
1793309,5,B00006SFKG,"Gladiator Days: Anatomy of A Prison Murder, an HBO documentary - where a film crew visited multiple prisons throughout the United States, interviewing inmates, prosecutors and guards - many of the clips displayed at the beginning will be quickly recognized as they have aired on national news outlets. (The ""Yard Fights"" in California, the prisoner being attacked by a dog while offering no resistance, rioting, etc., etc.)However, the documentary focuses on an inmate on inmate assault and subsequent homicide, captured by the Central Utah Prison security cameras. (Central is located in Draper, Utah)

Troy Kell, at the age of 18, was originally sentenced to life without parole, for a murder that took place in 1986, in his home-state of Nevada. A friend of his, Sandy Shaw, asked Troy to stop a man from harassing her & her family, b/c he wanted her to pose nude. Troy Kell, nor the second boy, William, knew the victim - had never met him and would have had no reason whatsoever to attack the man had it not been for the female codefendant. William, had stolen the gun used in the crime from a neighbor's home, made it available to Troy the night of the crime & it was subsequently located by Las Vegas PD in his home. The murder of 21 year old Cotton Kelly, in the desert, became known as the ""Show & Tell Murder"" because the female co-defendant, Sandy Shaw, returned to the seen of the crime multiple times showing the corpse off to her friends. One of the people that had seen this horrific scene reported it to the police.

Kell was transferred to Central Utah Prison as part of a prisoner exchange - and that is where he met Eric Daniels - a white supremacist, with multiple tattoos reflecting his personal ideologies - Daniels was initially sent to prison on a minimal forgery charge. He participated in a riot, was placed in solitary  confinement& six months later he actively participated in every aspect of the attack and subsequent homicide.

The security tape that captured the attack is chilling, albeit incomplete - and at first seems to have nothing more to offer than a grotesque view of what humans are capable of doing to each other under certain conditions. However, there's much more to be discerned from the tape, as well as, the documentary as a whole, if it is viewed with an unbiased, neutral opinion. For example, the extenuating circumstances that allowed three high risk inmates to be left, unsupervised in such close proximity of each other, the hand cuff key, the forged request, allowing an inmate that is on ""lock-down"" out of their cell, and lastly the amount of time that elapses before any authority figure intervenes - is absolutely reprehensible. (Considering the guards had access to multiple forms of non-lethal weaponry - and yet, not a single voice calls out over the intercom for the inmates to separate, ""rack in"", get prone, nothing....Look at the time on the video - the difference between when the first blow was struck and when the victim receives CPR is well over an hour....)

Yes, there are parts of the video that are hard to watch, making it all the more important to not look away! Turning away, shielding ourselves from that which is ugly, unsightly and harsh is what allows this inhumane environment to exist in prison. Placing a non-violent criminal in a supermax facility, sentencing an 18yr old young man to LWOP set all this in motion. What possible good could come from such sentences? When a person is given no chance to do anything positive or constructive...when all hope has been forever erased... what is left? For those in prison...it's simple - become the meanest, baddest, toughest individual in the house...why? To avoid being abused, defiled and degraded in the worst, most inhumane manner imaginable. And with 90% of inmates eligible for parole at some point in their lifetimes, these hardened, hardcore people will return to our communities and live in our neighborhoods,bringing with them all the hate, anger and bitterness the system instilled in them during their incareration.

I recommend anyone that is interested in ""true crime,"" human behavior, criminal justice, etc., and all parents should view this documentary, to familiarize themselves with the reality of the prison system - so as to better educate and hopefully deter their children from pursuing a similar path. An excellent tool for alternative schools and programs to utilize - without saying a word, with the simple push of a button the instructor can open the eyes of at risk youth...erasing the glamor and mystique so often associated with criminal behavior.",1216166400,10,4604,4.8961538461538465
1793310,5,B00006SFKG,"I first saw this compelling, often gruesome and very enlightening documentary on HBO. I have realized that in these maximum security men's prisons, most of the inmates either have to gang up for survival or they become the prey. If they are in fear of their lives, they either have to deal with it themselves or go to guards and wardens and risk being labeled as a ""snitch"" and killed for that. This documentary also first revealed to me facts that indicated Sandy Shaw, Kell's childhood friend, was railroaded into prison even though all he was supposed to do was fistfight a guy who was stalking her when she was a terrified 15-year-old, with no stalking law to protect her. Unbeknownst to anyone else, Kell brought a gun to that supposed harmless fistfight and shot and killed the adult stalker who was pursuing a minor child. In his effort to help her, Kell made his friend Sandy Shaw his second victim. Getting into the mind of a killer who grew up with a decent life and then snapped makes for fascinating viewing.",1179705600,4,1020,4.6098901098901095
1793311,5,B00006SFKG,"As a part-time criminal justice instructor, I make this DVD required viewing. As someone interested in the subject matter I think it addresses a variety of issues: racial issues, delinquency, juvenile housing, gang violence, lockup procedures,and criminality in general. I think it also addresses some of the stereotypes concerning criminals and criminal behavior. Troy Kell is the perfect example of someone who came from a decent family, educated and had all the tools for success, and yet ended up on death row (1st killing a guy over some foolishness and then committing a murder while in prison). I think even to the average person, they would find Kell charasmatic, charming (oops, that is the same thing), with no regrets or excuses. Bravado or not we will never know, but Kell is definately someone to be studied for years to come.",1176768000,4,839,5.0
1793312,4,B00006SFKG,"To be honest, I really don't see why people say this is that shocking. Perhaps I'm a little desensitized, but the attack is shown from quite a distance away. Overall, I liked the documentary. I thought it was interesting and very well done.",1149984000,,240,4.604651162790698

7973167,4,B00006SFKG,"If you can stand a realistically grim and gritty view of both a superficially charming racist psychopathic killer and the penal system that supported his cold-blooded killing of a black inmate, this is a rewarding movie.  Anthony Kell's murder of the black inmate says at least as much about the racist institutional support for the killing as it does about Kell.  Listen carefully to how the victim was set up to be sent to hospital infirmary even though he was not ill; listen carefully to how the prison guards watched without intervening as Kell's friend held the victim down and Kell stabbed him over-and-over during the prolonged course of many minutes until he gradually bled to death.  The guards, instead of intervening, were filming the murder - the video of the killing is the grisly highlight of this movie - but doing nothing until after Kell rose in exultation and started celebrating.  No guards were disciplined, and the in-prison cooperation to make the referral to the infirmary was never addressed.

The young Tony Kell and his ""philosophy"" is briefly but fruitfully explored, and then there is a telling narrative of the very vacant inner man.  In a wonderful moment Kell reflects upon his motives for committing the murder that put him in prison in the first place: Kell doesn't really know why he did it.  He was just going to rough up a man who was hounding a young neighborhood female friend of his, but brought a gun to the event, and then well... things happened.  You can see how loosely connected most of the group of murdering youngsters were to social consequences; the crime would have gone unsolved but for the fact that one of the killers kept bringing friends back to see the body to prove his boast of what he had done. The female friend, herself convicted as co-conspirator, adds a poignant contrast.  She is neither evil nor violent, and if she hadn't complained to Tony about the man harassing her she would have grown up fairly normally and not have spent most of her life behind bars.",1363996800,,2024,4.743589743589744
