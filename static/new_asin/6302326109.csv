451972,5,6302326109,"I loved this movie.  Jodie Foster is amazing in everything she does.  She pulls off the Brooklyn accent to perfection.  This film should have had more press, it is a great, heartwarming movie.  The actor who played ""Fred"" in the movie is rather good for his age (he also shows up in an episode of NYPD Blue).  He interacts well with the cast and is believable.
Basic plot outline; Mom, Jodie Foster, learns early on that there is something special about her little boy.  She has a hard time coming to terms with the fact that this child is, quite possibly, one of the smartest kids on the planet.  Some one tries to take him away to a better school, and she is offended that she cannot give him the intelectual stimulation he needs. So, she makes things difficult.  The rest, you will have to see.
The movie is very good and well worth purchasing.  I only have the VHS, so I don't know if the special features are anything special, though I doubt they would be very impressive.  It doesn't have special effects, therefore, there probably aren't fifteen ""behind the scenes"" documentaries.  It generally drives me a bit crazy when ""the making of"" of a movie is longer than the movie itself. Ex. The Matrix.
Gentlemen: this is a good movie to share with a ladyfriend.  You'll look like a hero, and you will actually enjoy the movie.  And, you won't even have to pretend you got something in your eyes. . No real tearjerking :)

452259,2,6302326109,"Jodie Foster directed this movie - a child prodigy's search for social acceptance. Fred Tate is a precocious fourth grader who has no problem with the most complex mathematical problems or in banging out a Rachmaninoff concerto on the piano, but is totally inept at playing baseball or dealing with children his own age. His mother Dede is a cocktail waitress who cares passionately about her son. Fred comes to the attention of child psychologist Jane Grierson who runs a summer camp for child prodigies called Odyssey of the Mind. She invites Fred to attend the summer session, creating a rift between Fred and Dede. Fred decides he's not interested in genius things like attending a university class, and would rather play pool and have friends. The movie is a poor waste of nearly two hours.",1314403200,3,795,4.852941176470588
452260,3,6302326109,I thought this was a charming story about a very talented boy... it definitely explores the human side of being so gifted. Foster as always is quite good. I particularly liked the scene where the kid reads the bottom of the plate...,1291680000,,232,4.5476190476190474
452261,3,6302326109,"The lead-in to this movie was so spectacular I went to bed late rather than pause play for the next day.  Dianne Wiest' crisp performance is above even her typical great work.  The film illustrates the alienation of a gifted child in a manner I never could find words for.  Even the child's frustration with his own parent -- that was stark-raving visionary.  You want to love and detest the child all at the same time.  All the elements are there, exactly where and when they need to be.

The problem is in the final scenes.  It's as though three chapters are missing.  Suddenly the boy is liked, respected and admired, and this time there's a crowd at his birthday party.  No clue is given how all this happened, no behavioral revolution, no epiphany, nothing!  Children tend to be mean to anyone different -- it doesn't matter that their peer got an A grade on his class project.  What made everything suddenly change?  Viewers young and old need at least a suggestion so they can take something away from the story.

You won't suffer any pain from seeing this movie.  The characters and the story line are pleasant.  I just hope you don't come away quite so disappointed as I was.",1266451200,,1184,4.545023696682464
452262,5,6302326109,This is the very best Jodie Foster effort....I Loved this movie...It's one you can watch over and over.,1239667200,,103,4.777777777777778
452263,4,6302326109,"I recently watched this movie again - I had seen it about a year after it came out, when I was about 11 years old.

I like the idea behind this movie - while I was (or am) not by any stretch as intelligent as Fred, the main character in this movie, I was more intelligent than many of my peers and thus experienced a lot of the same sorts of conflicts that Fred did. As such, I enjoyed this movie in that I could relate to it.

On the other hand, there were a lot of areas in this story where the psychology could have been explored in a fuller and more meaningful way. While I would not go as far as some of the other reviewers who have stated that the characters were two-dimensional, I would say that the portraits of the main characters could have used a couple more coats of paint.

Of the main characters, I think that Dede, Fred's mother, was best represented. Jane, on the other hand, who runs the Institute where Fred winds up attending, is a fascinating case in psychology and this movie only scratched the surface. There is a certain pathology that comes with highly motivated and successful people that has to be consciously worked through to be able to have a full sense of humanity. There are aspects of a balanced, fruitful life - such as a meaningful relationship with another person, and/or raising children - that are not dependent on intelligence, success, etc. Without them, even the most successful life feels hollow and empty. We see somewhat of a glimpse of this in this movie, but I think a little more exploration of this would have been welcome. Of course, there's only so much you can do in a two hour movie.

What makes this movie interesting, and again, it would have been nice to have this more fully explored, is Fred's observation of Jane's situation and his realization that he is heading down the same path, and doesn't want to. Through his experiences with his mother and later with Connick's character, Eddie, he knows that there is more to life than merely being intelligent and motivated. It is this balance that he is searching for, and it drives him to near-madness. I think this situation cleaned itself up a little too neatly in this movie. But, again, there's only so much you can do in two hours.

With respect to the production side of things, this movie was excellently directed, and the cinematography was superb. The soundtrack was above-average. The main character actors each did a respectable job. Overall, I would recommend checking this movie out.",1207353600,,2500,4.571428571428571

Let us not forget who discovers Fred, Jane Grierson played by Dianne Wiest.  His mother loves him, but Jane sees his potential and requests that Fred join her program.  He fits in better with the gifted children, and is happier with the new setup than he was before.  There are some special effects in this movie, to show you how Fred's genius mind works.

452297,3,6302326109,"Any director worth his or her "" salt "" would have taken advantage of all the missed opportunities in this movie. First, the characters are merely two dimensional and portray little to no genuine human emotion. The character developments in this film are really poor. Things just move too fast in this movie and from the beginning to end it feels lost amid a sea of turmoil with no light-house close by. I wish more would have been acknowledged about the "" mentors "" lonliness and her coming to grips with her inner pain, of which we see little of. Also the mother, Jodie Foster, seems to be acting by "" numbers "". This was one of her worst roles both in acting and script. There wasn't enough dynamics in the movie.

452300,3,6302326109,"I disagree somewhat with the reviews I have seen here.  Although the main character is a genius, I think the main plot is about finding your place in life.  While some children are lucky and slide right in, here the genius child is out of place with his surroundings.  With a teacher and mom who cannot stimulate him intellectually, and the other children who make fun of him.

Soon he has the chance to be in a school with other geniuses, but does he fit here?  I'll let you find out.

I think the boy is engaging and believable as the child genius.  And as always Diane Weist does a terrific job as the head of the 'genius institute'.  Jodie foster gives a good performance as the off beat mom.  And I think she does a good job as director, although some movie seems predictible.

Overall better than most of the movies out there getting 4 stars by critics.",1100995200,8,859,4.345911949685535
452301,4,6302326109,"In her first job as director Jodie Foster shows us more than competent ability with a willingness to tell a story that's not formulaic.

Jody plays Dede Tate, who could have been her character from ""Taxi"" all grown up.  Her only child is Fred.  She tells Fred she doesn't know who his father was.  She works odd jobs delivering drinks in a bar and ""dancing"".

Fred is seven years old for most of the movie, and he's a genius.  Not a little bit of genius - Fred has ""Good Will Hunting"" or maybe above when he grows up kind of genius.  He plays classical piano on the clunky upright that Dede sells at one point because finances get a little tight.  Fred writes and composes poetry and when other kids are playing kickball on the playground Fred makes chalk drawings that look like they belong in the Louvre.

What Fred would REALLY like is to play kickball with the other kids and not be considered a ""freak"".  When other kids are playing Fred is worrying about the ozone layer and the rain forests and fossil fuels, and Fred worries about it so much that he already has ulcers.  He's enrolled in a public school where class is so boring it takes awhile before his teachers realize he's not retarded.

Dianne Wiest plays Jane Grierson, who was another ""child prodigy"" and played violin in the symphony at age eleven before growing up to head an institute for other hyperintelligent children.  She hears about Fred and invites him to come join the group.

Much of the film deals with Fred being torn between biological Mom Dede and intellectual Mom Jane when he still REALLY wants a playmate.  Fred sees that despite her super intelligence, Jane is nonetheless alone and lonely.  He knows that his intelligence has long since surpassed Dede.  The other children at Jane's institute are the kind who get giddy over spelling words backwards and doing differential calculus in their head.  One of Fred's early role models, Damon, is nick-named ""The Mathemagician"" and goes everywhere with a big black cape.  Damon admits to Fred that he doesn't have any friends because he's ""an a--hole"".

At one point Jane takes Fred away with her to the University where she is lecturing and he takes Quantum Physics.  In a silly scene Fred enters a full classroom on the first day of class where 80% of the students leave upon discovering that the class is Quantum Physics.  Did they not know that when they registered? In a nice touch a little later the Quantum Physics students left behind are straining to look over Fred's shoulder at his notes as he is clearly ""getting it"" where they are not.

While at the university Fred gets bonked on the head and winds up meeting Eddie, played by Harry Connick, Jr. in a little movie interlude that adds almost nothing to the movie other than a scene where Fred gets a grown-up playmate.  Fred the classical pianist watches in awe as Eddie the jazz pianist tickles the ivories.  Fred has so much fun that he comes over to Eddie's the next morning. Eddie's fraternity brothers are only too happy to guide young Fred to Eddie's room where he has a young woman in a compromising position.

You don't have to understand Quantum Physics or be able to do complicated math in your head to enjoy this movie - it's about the characters, NOT the academics.  We're told over and over that, in addition to his incredible genius, Fred is also super perceptive and ""sensitive"".  He's the kind of kid I hope grows up to be President.  Then maybe he can SOLVE global warming, the rain forests, etc.",1100736000,8,3507,4.602254428341385
452302,4,6302326109,"Genius does not herd with genius, said Oliver Wendell Holmes, but come to think of it it does not herd with anyone at all. Little Man Tate charts the solitary prodigious existence of  a pint-sized 6-year old, gifted beyond the regular rations allocated to ordinary men.

The story is as hackneyed as can be: a working class mother fiercely protective of her little brainiac, wants him to do well, so despite sparks with school psychologist lets him take part in bigtime contests for special kids, where he meets people of all kinds, etc etc. You get the picture.

Or may be you don't. The proof is in the pudding. Debuting as a director, Jodie Foster nails the production quality. The cinematography is fabulous. While parts of the script are predictably cheesy, all the characters are generally pleasant, the emotional scenes are moving, and all the interactional contretemps resolve neatly in the end.

And the message is heartening: even if he is more ""grown up"" than the rest of his Peter Pan peers, Fred is not special in every way. He is just as needy of a mother's affection, a teacher's direction and the companionship of regular social groups.

Plain stuff, but very efficiently delivered. Recommended rental.",1091750400,11,1218,4.893203883495145
452303,4,6302326109,"Jodie Foster is known as one of the best actresses in these days, but with LITTLE MAN TATE she proved that she is capable of direct a good movie. LITTLE MAN TATE is a simple story, but it has many interesting angles.
Basically it's the story of Fred Tate, a prodigious kid (expert in mathematics, physic, music and painting, among many other things), and the struggle of his mother Dede (Jodie Foster) to give his little son the possibility of enjoy a normal life without significant worries, like most of the 8 year old kids have. Eventually they meet Dr. Jane Grierson (Dianne Wiest), who sees in Fred a reflex of herself, and she tries to develop even more Fred's abilities and intelligence.
LITTLE MAN TATE is a movie with interesting and multidimensional characters, even though this is a little movie, almost independent cinema, it's interesting enough to see Jodie Foster's solid directional debut. The best performances in LITTLE MAN TATE are: Adam Hann-Byrd as the little Fred Tate, he is the centerpiece of the plot and the movie, also Dianne Wiest is fine as Dr. Jane Grierson, her presence changes the life of Fred and his mom Dede. In LITTLE MAN TATE Jodie Foster is adequate as an actress, but as a director she is even better.",1078617600,4,1241,4.697247706422019
452304,5,6302326109,"The first time I watched this movie, I knew I was going to love it.  Jodie Foster is a *superb* actress and director.  In fact, ""Little Man Tate"" is her directoral debut.  Dianne Wiest also gives a wonderful performance in this movie as the psychologist with whom Fred Tate (a stunning performance by Adam Hann-Byrd) studies.  A little overbearing at times, she really gave her character life.  Dede Tate (Foster) is Fred's Mom who doesn't have a steady job and feels like she is competing with Jane (Wiest) for Fred's affection.  She finally comes to the realization that her son is looking for one thing and one thing only: a Mom.  So now it's up to her to prove that she is a good mom.  This movie is definitely meant for anyone who likes these actors.  I say that because they are all at their best in this brilliant movie.  The commentary by Jodie Foster is also a great addition to the movie.  This is one movie that I will not get tired of anytime soon.",1059436800,,960,4.3977272727272725
452305,4,6302326109,"An excellent movie detailing the trials and tribulations of a grade school genius.  Jodie Foster does a super job of acting and directing. Its nice to see her warmth and concern when trying to look out for her son's best interests.  Also intriguing is Jodie Foster's struggles in relating to her son.
But beyond the fine acting is the story which depicts young Fred's struggles with fitting into a mainstream society.  In spite of his great mental prowess, all young Fred would like is a playmate.  While waiting to go on a television show, his most innocent bonding is with the makeup artist's little son.  Fred is curious and genuine and wants to make friends.  Unfotunately there are many difficult people out there who certainly try to limit his confidence in developing relationships.  Its a series of attempts and little successes and failures that enable Fred to grow interactively.  He sure has the intelect.
Anyway, engaging and charming this movie certainly is.  Try it on to get perspective on what its like to be a child prodigy.",1051574400,2,1041,4.836158192090395

The plot elements are extremely unrelated - be prepared for alot of confusion! While watching the movie you simply get many not-so-related facts thrown at you. I also wished they had a better conclusion.",1040947200,,373,4.666666666666667

7824145,4,6302326109,Good movie but has one inappropriate scene when the little boy goes into a Dorm and finds his adult friend with a girl in his bedroom. Not sure how much they showed because I fast-forwarded the scene. The rest of the movie was about the little boy's mother (she is a waitress) and the mother's friend (a bit on the wild side) has a hair-brain idea for both of them that turns out to be a disaster. The little boy is very smart but lonely when he goes along a trip with a lady professor and some other high-IQ kids that are a bit strange.,1479686400,,537,4.123809523809523
