2225227,5,B0007P0Y7W,"Elektra was not a bad movie. jennifer Garner is the only one that could have done this role. She is amazing and i liked her so much better in this movie than Daredevil since she did not show what she could do in it, but now she had the chance to show everything and i must say i was very impressed. The Fight scenes are great and Garner is even better. Buy this DVD, you won't regret it..",1108944000,2,388,3.9871794871794872
2225228,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Jennifer Garner (Catch Me If you Can, Alias) returns as that sexy clad knife swirling Elektra we loved in that stinky DareDevil movie with tht Ben Affleck guy. Elektra returns, back from the dead and kicking major (...) in a movie directed by Rob Bowman (The X-Files movie, Reign Of Fire) The Hand is a evil society waging a war on the good people to find the treasure, which is a young girl with powers they want to bring to their team, but Elektra won't let that happen as she highkicks it into overdrive and goes on a karate chopping adventure. The badguys consist of a whiterobed/faster then lightning guy who years ago when Elektra was little killed her mother. There's a woman who you don't wanna make out with, a big buff black guy that cant be penetrated and a tatoo freak in which animals come out of his body. Elektra kicks ass and doesnt take names as she goes on fighting these baddies to bring peace and save the little girl. Some good action set pieces spark this sometimes corny plotted movie but its a notch higher then DareDevil at least thats in my mind. Jennifer Garner is smoking!! Also starring Terence Stamp (The Limey, Poor Cow), Gorn Visnjic (E.R., Close Your Eyes) and Jason Isaacs (The Patriot, Event Horizon). For diehard Garner fans.",1108771200,,1261,4.584070796460177

2225230,2,B0007P0Y7W,"What a shame what a miss,

The special effects were mildy entertaining, the fight scenes lacking, in addition they tried to make Jennifer into a dark moody/broody kick butt woman. Sorry Jennifer you did not pull it off. DEARDEVIL was ok but this was LESS than OK.

A definite let down in the ""comic book to movie"" category.",1107907200,,323,4.551724137931035
2225231,3,B0007P0Y7W,"This is a spin-off from 'Daredevil' as a combination of fantasy and science fiction, with a female ""urban legend"" of comics who is a lost soul with no place to go, nowhere to turn. That's as close as this movie gets to real life.  As I recall, 'Daredevil' in his red leather outfit donned his disguise to help mankind in his mission to avenge his father's death. In this production of Regency Pictures using Marvel Comics, the female protagonist in her skimpy red outfit is a high paid killer with an analytical mind who seeks to avenge the murder of her mother. Thus, the tables are turned.

In this allegory of the ancient war between good and evil, he chose the good, she the evil. She was told by her teacher, a member of the group HAND, that some lessons can't be taught; you must live them to be understood. He is convinced that she is poisoned by hate but has a 'pure' heart.  Terence Stamp made a good leader named aptly 'Stick' who is a holdover from ""Daredevil' where he taught the hero how to fight. Here, he does the same for Elektra and later young Abby Miller.  Mark Miller was played by Goran Visnjic of ER fame, a dead-ringer for the young, handsome Robert Downey, Jr., whose star has faded. He was the only character seemingly human. His daugher, 13-yr-old Abby, has a criminal mind and believes the adage that nobody tells the truth about themselves.

All humans make mistakes, but these demonic comic-book characters were not human. I have the theory that this movie is not totally fantasy: there are such demons among us in plain sight.  Apparently raised from the dead in 'Daredevil,' she does the same for Abby. She had become emotionally involved with Mark and saw in rebellious Abby the 'young girl she once was.' She knew firsthand that life was not always going to be a bowl of cherries, nor would it turn out to be a bowl of sour grapes either.

There are some unusual special effects, and the machinegun violence and weird confrontations were a little much. Tatoo was all snakes, just one of the demonic assassins sent by the Council of the HAND to finish the job Elekta chose not to do and find the 'treasure.' He almost demolished what he was sent to do.  Location shots at a monastery (indoor and outdoors) were lavish. Everything was foreign to me, since I've never read this genre of comic books (I debate the connotation 'comic' in this type of violent illustrated media.) and I was shaken to the core. The director did his job well, as did the actors, but I doubt I will attend this type of production again. To me, comic means something to make you laugh and feel good. This film had the opposite effect.",1106179200,,2640,4.519916142557652
2225232,1,B0007P0Y7W,"It can't be pretended that ""Elektra"" is anything but a cash-in on ""Daredevil"" and star Jennifer Garner's popularity as an action star. And the spinoff film as as soulless as that would suggest -- it has some pretty special effects, but is brought down by a half-hearted script that aspires to be a mix of Chinese wire-fu and ""Kill Bill.""

Elektra (Jennifer Garner) died at the end of ""Daredevil."" But in the comic book world, death is less restricting than a sprained knee: Elektra is resurrected by the magical mystical powers of Terence Stamp (okay, his character is ungracefully called Stick). She is now a contract killer, and is sent to off a father and daughter in some remote place.

It turns out that there is a Chosen One (hello, fantasy cliches!) who will be a pivot in the battle between good and evil. And the girl Abby (Kirsten Prout) is that Chosen One. Beset by childhood traumas, Elektra decides to protect the two of them from the Hand, a magical bunch of Japanese evildoers who have decided to kill Abby.

When a movie is a cash-in spinoff of a cinematic disaster like ""Daredevil,"" you can't expect it to be good. Especially if the lead heroine -- as in the howlingly bad ""Catwoman"" -- wears silly leather bondage gear and utters moronic quips. Can't there be a heroine who wears something that would stay on during kung-fu ation scenes?

Rob Bowman better stick to sci-fi suspense, because he can't do action. It feels as if he wanted to make a cross between ""Kill Bill"" and ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"" with a bit of ""Zatoichi"" (the blind master) thrown in. The script teems with cliches -- the tortured tough gal! The sensitive love interest! The precocious, poorly-acted kiddie! The wise Yoda clone! Throw in a few high-kicks and you have ""Elektra.""

It's impossible to really gauge Garner's acting, because the character is as deep as a hamster's footbath -- okay, her mum died when she was little. Very sad, but it doesn't give her character depth, and Elektra Natchios shows no real personality except a few strained quips. Her love interest barely registers, and the villains are just there to do special effects and inconsistent stunts. (One minute you can stab them, the next they're invincible. Huh?)

""Elektra"" is a heartless, dull mess of flips and quips -- and that's just the character. The movie is even worse, second only to ""Catwoman"" for comic book badness.",1105660800,2,2398,4.766265060240964

she is hired to get rid of someone but she has to go to the place and wait a few days before,
the job is to be done, in the meantime, she stays in a nice beach side house that has been leased for the week end
she meditates and works out by herself to get ready,  as she does her thing
on the beach,  a  man comes up to her who she does not know and ask if she had
seen his mis behaving daughter and she replies yes and tells him that she broke in her house earlier,
when the job is reported to her who it is to be eliminated, she finds out , its the man and the daughter she had just met
so, that made it difficult to kill them, come to find out neither of the two are who they say they are,
so she decides to protect the two instead of killing them, now remember the daughter,
because she accidentally shows Electra she has special skills in the Marshall arts as well
her dad does not, but , they are all are in danger from the hand, another group of Asian assassins,

2225355,1,B0007P0Y7W,"Great movie for insomniacs! I often have difficulty falling asleep. During this movie I had difficulty staying awake. And this is after a good night's sleep.

The occasional fight scenes are unexciting. During one fight, the scene switches repeatedly between a couple seconds of other characters fighting and 3-4 seconds of Elektra running through the woods. Then a few seconds of others fighting, followed by what might as well be the same footage of Elektra running. This repeats several times, until you wonder if she will ever finally get to the fight. The anti-climax of a final battle between Elektra and a bunch of laundry is just bizarre. It is somehow unusual, unexpected, and yet completely uninteresting.

In my opinion, a good action movie not only has good fight scenes, but also has good character and plot development. This movie has none of the above. It appears that the script did not have enough material to make a full movie, so they took everything that was not a fight scene and drew it out as long as possible and interspersed it with dull training scenes. This appears to be successful because, although the movie only reaches a 99 minute running time, it seems Much longer. Elektra has a lot of strange hallucinations and flashbacks during the movie. Despite any attempts at character development and background, it fails to make me care about any of the characters.

I am a fan of Daredevil. I would like to see his character and other characters from the comics (including Elektra and Kingpin) developed in movies. Unfortunately, this is one of the mindnumbingly dullest movies I have ever seen. I only recommend it to someone in search of a cure for insomnia.",1492646400,,1687,4.850694444444445

As a movie, this is a typical plot we've seen time and time again.  Good vs. Bad, ""I'm retired"" only to take ""one more assignment"".  Barring all that and knowing it's really a predictable movie, it WAS good.  It wasn't fantastic but it was a strong flick that's worth seeing more than once.",1464220800,,530,4.22

2225608,5,B0007P0Y7W,One of my favorite adventure movies.  Superior to many of the current Marvel movies. Good acting; great fighting scenes and rarest of all a well written intelligent plot.  Jennifer Garner absolutely inhabits the role.  Too bad there was no sequel.  Makes Ben look sad in his latest Batman role.  Any fan of action fantasy needs to ignore the comic book fanboys.

2225669,4,B0007P0Y7W,"Elektra has a common redemptionary theme where she herself doesnt even realize that she has changed. Through the use of the directors film making tactics and the color schemes throughout the movie, Elektras character is introduced and portrayed as an emotionless hired assassin. In the very first scene, Elektra dressed in her scarlet red outfit, kills a man without showing any sign of regret or indifference about it. Later, when the young character Abby is introduced, Elektra doesnt allow any kind of relationship or connection to form, which leads the audience to infer that there must be a traumatic incident that would cause her to act this way towards another person. We learn later that Elektra had witnessed the murder of her father and when she was a child, her mother was killed. The death of her mother acts as the catalyst for her emotional paralysis. Her father also scarred her with his terrorizing ways of parenting which she has numerous flashbacks to through the entire movie.
 The director of the movie Elektra, Bob Bowman, uses a flashback tactic to allow the audience to be shown why and how Elektra acts the way she does. This is a similar tactic used with the Marvel Superhero; Hulk. She is constantly haunted by these flashbacks from when she was a young girl. In these flashbacks, she never grows up, representing that her psychological development stopped due to the traumatic event of finding her mother dead. The little girl in flashbacks almost acts as a cheerleader back to innocence to the assassin for hire, grown-up Elektra. We start to see the change in her when she is sent to kill Abby and her father but instead tried to protect them. She forms a sense of compassion for these two characters which triggered her first step to a change of hearther first step in healing.
 Elektra was originally featured in the film Daredevil usually wearing all black. The change in color from black to red symbolizes how Elektra switches her life path and is now and assassin for hire. Elektra fights with sias, it isn't that she has a superpower. This could be important, especially because being a woman, showing strength and superiority. Everyone that she comes in contact with have a supernatural power of some sort and Elektra just has her twin sias!
 Elektra is supposed to be an action, thriller film with even a hint of romance in there between her and Mark but it is too surface levelthere are not many large, intense fight scenes and her and Mark share maybe two intimate kisses. The climatic event which is the war or fight against The Hand was not that effective because the film lacked the building up of tension and conflict and emotional connection for it to be as intense as it should have been. The fight scene with Elektra and The Hand was none-too-thrilling even with Jennifer GarnersElektrahot outfit. The only emotional moment in this film was when Elektra cried over Abbys dead body. The film itself didn't lead it to be as sentimental as it could be but it was the best that was going to come from this unexpressive heroin.
 A key turning point in Elektra was during the fight scene where Elektra and Kirigi are fighting and through his powers tries to confuse and destroy the concentration of Elektra by lifting all of the sheet-draped furniture and sent it flying up in the air, swirling around in the room. Her fighting through all of the white sheets symbolizes the internal fight within herself about giving up the bad guy, assassin for hire, behaviors and returning to the innocence that the child in her flashbacks encourages her to return to. In the middle of this fight scene after Kirigi throws a powerful blow towards Elektra, she is pitched backwards across the room being wrapped in a white sheet while in mid air. At this moment, all the red from her outfit is covered up. In the flashbacks showing Elektras mother, she was always buried under a white sheet. When she hits the ground a white sheet drifts over to her and folds directly over her entire body. This is a representation of her becoming innocent and pure again. Her getting up and returning to the fight was a rebirth.
 Elektra never was able to realize how much of an internal change meeting Abby and Mark had on her. By the end of the film she had transformed into a no longer selfish, cold-blooded martial arts fighter. In a way, Elektra healed herself. She was a woman who lived a life full of guilt and remorse and lacking the ability to become emotionally connected with another person since her mother had died. After her rebirth, she became a woman with new strengths and a sense of peace within herself. This creates a broader implication of the stepping stones in progression for all female heroine with Elektras ability to overcome the barriers setup so early on in her life.",1446508800,,4807,4.724672228843862

2225701,3,B0007P0Y7W,"THE FILM: Even by pre-MCU standards, ELEKTRA is pretty bad. You have a nonsensical script, flat characters, uninspired dialogue, and equally bad delivery. DAREDEVIL was no prize, but this spin off failed in a large part to even be entertainingly bad. I can't really claim to know much about Elektra since I've never read any of the comics, but I have a hard time believing that the interpretation here was in any way faithful, except maybe cosmetically. If there's one thing the film has going for it, Jennifer Garner looks stunningly attractive in the character's trademark red costume. Even the filmmakers seem to be aware of this fact, as they spend an inordinate amount of screen time devoted to her movement in slow motion just looking sexy. Aside from some hackneyed backstory, though, Elektra is barely as fleshed out as the supporting cast around her. Even more to its detriment, no attempt is made whatsoever to explain anything whatsoever. The only thing that is clear is that The Hand is after some teenage girl who is ""The Treasure,"" and Elektra somehow gets caught in the middle of it. Other than that, it's the same old ""antihero who finds the good within themselves"" hokum that we've seen dozens of times already. But, one must give credit where credit is due. The production design and art direction on this film is pretty darn good. Costumes, sets, and effects were all done quite well. Even the action, though edited in a slightly irritating way, was effective enough. Too bad there wasn't more of it, though. The best scene is arguably Elektra's (re)introduction, but after that the pacing takes a nosedive and doesn't really recover until the last 30 minutes, and by then it's too late. Plenty of time is spent with Elektra and the two people she's originally tasked with killing, but the villains are left out in the cold as far as development is concerned. They all look cool and have some cool abilities, but their goal is ill-defined (as is the human MacGuffin they're after) and the actors playing them were risibly bad when they decided to open their mouths. If there's anything else to say to the film's detriment, it's that the pacing is so lethargic in the middle portion it becomes boring. When it comes down to it, I feel like only the Marvel completist would enjoy this in the slightest. Even as a DAREDEVIL apologist, I must say that ELEKTRA is non-essential when it comes to the Marvel canon. There is visual appeal to be had, but that's about it. Thank goodness the rights reverted back from Fox to Marvel Studios, because I feel like the Netflix DAREDEVIL show will finally get her right.

THE EXTRAS: One interesting thing about special features is that can allow you, particularly for less successful films, to see where things went wrong. While it didn't go too deep into specific issues with the filmmaking process, the two-part documentary (roughly 130 minutes in total) on the making of ELEKTRA did allow some potential problem areas to come to the fore. The biggest issues appear to have been the script, which should have gone through more revisions, and the rushed shooting schedule. Part of this is probably due to director Rob Bowman's experience working in television, but Marvel also has some blame because they wanted to get this made so quickly off the heat of DAREDEVIL. The making of the film was surprisingly well-documented, featuring a lot of behind-the-scenes footage and dailies (some with director commentary). The first part deals with filming, and the second part with post-production activities like editing, sound design, VFX and scoring. Of the features directly relating to the film itself, the deleted/extended/alternate scenes were perhaps the most enlightening, and in some cases I thought that they would have been artistically and thematically stronger choices. Those scenes can also be watched with director commentary. There were also a couple of shorter features which pertain to the character of Elektra. The first was about the history of Elektra in the comics, and it goes into quite a lot detail as to how comics are made, which I found fascinating. There is also a shorter featurette on Elektra in Greek mythology. Finally, there are a couple of trailers, and a feature audio commentary. Being that this is the director's cut, I did try to keep an eye out for changes/additions. To be honest, I couldn't tell that much different, and this version is only 3 minutes longer. The major changes seem to be some flash-forward sequences and slightly more graphic kills. The special features are also different than those included on the theatrical cut's release.

OVERALL: It's taken a while for comic book movies to find their footing, and ELEKTRA came at a time when they hadn't quite found it, despite successes like X-MEN and Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN. ELEKTRA may be a failure but, at least combined with the supplementary material, is an interesting failure. Rob Bowman and Jennifer Garner should be recognized for at least going into the project with the intention of making a good film that was more character than action-driven. The real fault lies with the writers and corporate meddling, in my opinion. On its own, I would say that ELEKTRA is not worth buying simply because it's not that great of a film, but the healthy supply of special features make it worth a purchase for the most ardent of Marvel fans.",1437091200,2,5389,4.888524590163934

2225766,2,B0007P0Y7W,"Like many others, I suspect, what I know about comic book superheroes comes from the movies.  So I hadn't heard of the character Elektra until Jennifer Garner was cast as her in the 2003 DareDevil movie.  When this spin off focusing on her character was announced, I was excited, until the reviews started coming out.  While it dropped off my must see list, it stayed on my radar because of my love of Jennifer Garner.  I finally got around to seeing it.  The amount of time and money I spent not rushing out to see this turned out to be just about right.

After dying (in DareDevil), Elektra (Jennifer Garner) has been resurrected and trained in martial arts.  She can manipulate time, making her a deadly assassin.  But while Elektra travels from one assignment to another, she is haunted by nightmares from her past.

Nearing Christmas, she wants to take a few days off, not to spend them with family, but to try to fight off her personal demons.  But she gets a job that pays more than she can turn down, so she settles into a cabin in the middle of nowhere to await her target.

After befriending the neighbors, Mark Miller (Goran Visnjic) and his daughter Abby (Kirsten Prout), she finds out her mission is to kill them.  But her heart awakens instead, and she winds up protecting them from others also sent to kill them.  But there are even more powerful figures after the Millers.  Can Elektra keep them safe?

The problem with this movie is it truly has no heart.  No matter how absurd the story, we need to identify with someone to get into the story.  But that never happens here.  Elektra would be the obvious choice, but she is so cold, we just don't care.  Mark isn't developed enough, and Abby is annoyingly stupid.  The end result is that we spend 97 minutes watching stuff happen to people we don't care about.

I'm not going to put this completely at the feet of the acting, but it could have been better.  I do think the cast was trying, but they didn't have much to work with script wise.  Goran Visnic and Kirsten Prout certainly do what they can to make their characters come to life.  The rest are pretty much one note characters set up to be moved around by the plot.  A cardboard cutout would have done just as well as the cast.  Please note, I'm not saying the cast was bad.  I'm just saying they didn't have characters to portray.

Even Elektra falls into the one note trap.  I get the fact that she is dealing with some pretty heavy stuff.  But Jennifer Garner seems to be sleepwalking through the film.  I'm sure she was told to play her character emotionlessly, and as such she did a great job.  But it was a poor choice since we needed emotion to connect with her.

Then there's the director's weird lighting choice.  Almost every scene involves heavy use to shadow.  I'm sure it was supposed to set the mood and be symbolic, but all it did was annoy me to death.  I spent much of the film trying to see what all was happening.  If a character ever got more than half of themselves properly lit, it was unusual.  I mean, really, if you are going to put Jennifer Garner in a tight red leather outfit, let us see it.  Please!

If you are just looking for some action scenes, you will be rewarded.  There are some nice edge of your seat scenes scattered throughout the film.  One of the villains has some very cool tattoos, and I loved any time he was on screen.  Granted, most of the action wasn't realistic, but it was fun to watch.

Unfortunately, those action scenes weren't enough to save an overall dismal film.  If you absolutely must watch Elektra, wait until you can see it for free.",1430870400,,3620,4.418181818181818

After coming back from the dead and trained in the deadly art of Kimagure, Elektra Natchios is a killer-for-hire. Upon receiving her new contract, she goes up against a band of ninja assassins known as The Hand, who are also after the same target: a young martial arts prodigy with a potential for greatness. Elektras past meets her present as she seeks to protect this young prodigy while also facing demons of her own.

I was in the minority of people who liked Daredevil, in which Jennifer Garner also played Elektra. When I heard she was getting her own spin-off movie, I was really excited because, while Im not an expert on the Elektra character, I know enough to know that a film version would be awesome. We didn't quite get that with this flick, but thats not to say it was utterly terrible. However, what audiences expected and what they got were different things.

Lets see . . . I was happy that Elektra sported her famous red costume in this as opposed to the black one in Daredevil. Though technically totally impractical in real life, having her very-similar-to-comic-book-costume on screen was cool for fanboys and fangirls alike and, no, not for the reason youd think. Just something about seeing a comic book character as they are on screen brings a thrill.

The fighting sequences were not bad and Hollywoods version/perception of the martial arts is always interesting as they tend to add all sorts of legend and mystique to them as opposed to their reality.

They got the gist of the character but didn't get hardcore into it, and it was clear this was just a way to cash in on the Daredevil movie that came out a couple years before. A solid story of Elektras assassin exploitseven if you want her to fight mercenaries with a similar agendawouldve been a great help, but this flick seemed more introspective and slower paced versus something that shouldve been geared toward the action-and-suspense genre (i.e. a high profile target, like a president or something, then have that person tie into Elektras mythology. Set her on the run while also giving her history and what its like to be someone who was supposed to be dead, some in-costume Daredevil universe cameos, and youd have a solid story). Just ideas.

In the end, if they ever went back and rebooted the character, Id definitely check it out as the potential is there, but wasn't fully exploited with this outing.",1422662400,,2409,4.710213776722091

I don't really know how this is supposed to fit in with the rest of the Marvel movies.  The only real connection it has to them is ""The Hand,"" and Elektra herself.  Oh and I guess they had someone in it that could be Typhoid Mary if I squint hard enough.  Other than that, this story doesn't really have that Marvel feel to it.  And just a side note, I don't remember from any comics I've read that Elektra was OCD.  But in this one she is constantly scrubbing and cleaning her living quarters and arranging her bathroom supplies so they are perfect.  It's just odd to me.

Also I have realized something as I watched this movie.  You know how many movies have top secret spies or secret assassins or mystical warriors for our heroes to fight?  Well, ever notice how they kinda, well, you know... SUCK!?!  I'm serious!  Who in their right mind would be afraid of these ninjas?  They seem like they die easier than the red shirts in Star Trek!

The story is just bland, and right away I knew that her targets were going to be the father and daughter she was hanging out with.  And I'll admit that the fight scenes were okay and they kept my interest as I was watching.  Well except for the part where we had sheets flying around in the last fight scene.  What was the point of that?  Also the scenes with Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa in them were cool.  He actually gave a pretty good performance.

His scenes and the fight scenes are the reasons this movie gets 2 stars instead of just 1.  If you like Marvel Comics or Marvel Comics movies, you can skip this one, it's just a stinker and not really worth watching.  Then again if it's raining and you have nothing else to do, it'll keep you entertained for 90 minutes.",1421193600,,1773,4.293051359516617

2225934,1,B0007P0Y7W,"For many years, I would have said that the movie ""Batman and Robin"" with George Clooney was the worst superhero movie, or perhaps I would have cited Halle Barry's ""Catwoman.""  But after recently seeing ""Elektra"" for the first time I can now submit that ""Elektra"" is, without question, the worst superhero movie I have ever seen.

For those that don't know, let me explain that this film was a spinoff of the 2003 film ""Daredevil"".  Jennifer Garner gave a memorable performance as Elektra (Matt Murdock/Daredevil's love interest) in that film, so someone had the idea to give Garner her own movie where she reprises her role.  While I personally don't think that the film ""Daredevil"" is nearly as bad as many suggest, it looks like a flawless masterpiece when compared to ""Elektra"".  This is a real shame because I'm a Jennifer Garner fan as well, and even she couldn't save this movie.

I could go on and on enumerating just how bad this film is.  The overall pace is slow and boring; the characters are forgettable; one of the main villains is defeated in an extremely implausible way (defying the laws of gravity to do it); and there are no references whatsoever to Elektra's past relationship with Daredevil (did he really mean that little to her?).

The most irritating aspect of this film is that it was too much in Elektra's head.  Take this bizarre scene for an example: Elektra has resolved to protect a father and her daughter.  Assassins are closing in to kill them and Elektra knows it.  So she stops and closes her eyes, in an apparent attempt to help her focus on the impending task.  The villains subsequently break in and quickly shoot Elektra, and then they murder the daughter.  But then we suddenly cut back to that same shot of Elektra's closed eyes.  The whole scene was just in her head.  Why she chose to imagine the worst case scenario before fighting is beyond me.

Furthermore, the film gives us numerous flashbacks from Elektra's mysterious past, both while she sleeps at night and when she is awake.  The problem is they are so random they stop holding your interest after a while; they actually became a distracting nuisance to me.

In conclusion, there are some superhero movies that are so bad you love to hate them; ""Elektra"" is not one of them.  This film is so bad you just keep asking yourself how much longer until it's finally over!  If you are a superhero fan, I would suggest that you steer clear of this film.  Once again, in my opinion, this is the worst superhero movie ever.

MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.

Elektra, the sequel to Daredevil, has a very good trailer, a great opening action sequence and of course, Jennifer Garner, but that was basically it. There's a scene in the trailer which is not in the movie for some reason, and the plot is basically chopped up, like an appetizing Big-N'-Toasty that looks great when advertised on television, but the actual meal is a let-down. The actual storyline was good, but it could have been much better. Barely a reference to Daredevil and some fleeting glimpses of the death of Elektra's mother, the latter of which barely has any significance to the plot, beyond explaining why Elektra wants to protect Abby. More plot was needed, and what is it with almost every movie made these days in which the Lord's Name is taken in vain? ""Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain."" Hence the three stars.

See it once.

As a big Marvel fan, I had some epxectations of what I wanted to see out of the Elektra movie.  What we got is a B-movie like story but wiith a great actress Jennifer Garner.  I like the fight scenes, but I wish the director kinda pulled more elements from the comics such as the Elektra Assasin story.  Jennifer Garner is absolutely stunning in this movie.  But even her acting could not save this movie.  I still gave it an okay review due to the movie being Elektra.  I hope in the future, a movie studio will reboot this character and give it a edgier and more mature story such as her Assasin story.  I am sure most fans from the Daredevil movie will watch this.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed at how this story and movie turned out.",1350432000,,836,4.341935483870968

2226073,3,B0007P0Y7W,"There is more emotion and drama in this film than one would expect from the type of movie this is represented to be. I can see why those who are dedicated to unstopping carnage would find this one too introspective and reflective on the emotions and much too short on action. At the beginning the viewer is advised of the ongoing battle between the forces of good and evil and then the movie proceeds to explore its manifestation in the lives of a small group of people on both sides of the conflict.

There are a lot of flashbacks that show the circumstances surrounding the development of Elektra's personality and priorities and show the internal battles she is waging between anger and love. The horrible circumstances surrounding her discovery of her mother's body when she was a child continues to haunt her and serve as a catalyst for her anger. The movie is primarily about Elektra's development as a fighter for good as she discovers her true nature is more inclined toward good than toward evil. In the course of this discovery she places herself in great danger protecting two people who will have more significance in her life than she ever expects.

If one can accept the required assumptions the movie can be entertaining. It is something of a departure from the norm but may be acceptable to some. I rate it not too bad.",1335916800,,1335,4.6525423728813555

2226122,2,B0007P0Y7W,"I was watching the director's cut of the film and thinking, ""Wow, this is violent"".  People were getting pierced through the chest, blood was seeping in the weapons, and there was a brief decapitation, yet why were the bad guys turn into green smoke when they're killed?  The movie never explained why they evaporate into green gas, so there's no point for the violent director's cut to not just leave them as corpses.  It's about as pointless as the making of this movie.

""Elektra"" is an underwhelming, unnecessary spinoff to a below-par superhero movie.  There isn't much to tell about Elektra that I should care about, it's just another boring revenge/redemption tale that's already been told in ""Daredevil"".  It started off with a pointless entry scene when she assassinated some guy, and then she was tasked to kill a family of two but then she suddenly had a change of heart due to mommy issues and thus she's defending them while fighting against the one that killed her family (or at least her mother, it never showed what happened to her pappy).  I never really liked the daughter and father of the targeted family, the daughter comes off as selfish, even after the revelation about her was given, while the father is for the most part irrelevant.  These two are mostly there to intrude Elektra's actions, and characters who interfere are never likable.  As for the villains, members of The Hand, it's amazing how they're initially portrayed as a powerful force and the organization became less relevant as the plot goes on, leading to only a few baddies taking action.  The supervillains actually look cool in design (except for that Poison Ivy rip-off), that Tattoo guy given special notice, but how they're defeated was very anti-climatic.

The plot is secondary to special effects, and even then, the special effects were poorly done.  They tried too hard to show off, and a couple of effects were blatantly obviously like the bracelet attack by a certain character.  Most of the effects are even impractical, like how that main villain can quick-dash which leaves a trail and yet why doesn't he used that technique AND attack his foe at the same time.  A lot of characters used that quick move to appear and reappear on screen, yet I find that to be a lazy effect.  As lousily-written and below-par ""Elektra"" is, it does have one incredible moment worth mentioning: an evil ninja breaking his own neck without using his limbs; that was the best part of the whole movie.",1276300800,,2484,4.7981220657277
2226123,5,B0007P0Y7W,"This is one of Jennifer Garner's finest movies. Made as a sequal to ""DARE DEVIL"" which stared both her and her now husband Ben Affleck, she goes well beyond the first movie. This tells how she was brought back to life (she was killed by Bullseye in the first movie) and the progression of Elektra's carreer past that point. Her martial arts moves go way beyond what you saw of her on her TV series ""ALIAS"" and she has put her heart and soul into the role. Shot on a very short schedule due to Miss Garner's availability (she was in between shooting of Season 3 and 4 of ""ALIAS"" when this was done)the Director none the less put together an outstanding film with a really great cast. Also Miss Garner brought along her personal Stunt Double from ""ALIAS"" so all the tough stunts were pulled off really great. They put together a really good behind the scenes video in the extras menu so you can see how it was all done. I highly recommend this Blu-ray version of the film and also recommend that you get ""DARE DEVIL"" as they compliment each other greatly.",1275696000,7,1053,4.4051282051282055

2226125,2,B0007P0Y7W,"Elektra: 4 out of 10: When people said Jennifer Garner, as Elektra, was the best thing in the movie Daredevil. I'm pretty sure they were mostly damning with faint praise. After all Jennifer, while certainly an attractive female, came across as a sorority pledge playing dress-up on S and M rush night.

In Elektra she looks even more ridiculous. There have been plenty of great female assassins over the years from the camp of a Bond villain, to the seductiveness of Linda Fiorentino, even the girl next-door deadliness of Bridget Fonda in Point of No Return. Female assassins are a wonderful staple of filmdom, seductive yet deadly. Garner is neither. ""She looks like she is thinking of puppies,"" claimed one reviewer I read and I concur. If the Smurfs were X-rated ninja's, then Garner would still be miscast in Smurfette: Deadly Blue.

Her costumes certainly don't help her cause. You almost have the urge to tell her to put some clothes on and bright red Victoria Secret lingerie just doesn't scream stealth or deadly. Lord knows the rest of this mess doesn't help Garner either.

While Terrance Stamp can do no wrong every else seems either miscast or afraid of stealing Garner's thunder. Add on poor special effects, villains that turn into family friendly yellow smoke when killed, ninjas that crash through windows like Army rangers, gas stoves that explode like nuclear weapons, laundry fu, Japanese villains out of a World War 2 propaganda film and my personal favorite the warmest Christmas in Canadian history.

The movie clearly takes place in the northwest United States or Vancouver. The days are long, everyone is in short sleeves, and Garner takes recreational swims in the lake. (Canadian Lakes are notoriously cold even in August mind you) So when a cherub faced character asks Garner over for Christmas dinner Elektra isn't the only one surprised.

2226127,1,B0007P0Y7W,"Finally got to see this and I can say it was definitely NOT worth the wait.

This movie has the production values of a bad pilot and the story is about as dull an uninteresting as that same dull pilot. I first encountered the character in the Daredevil comics back in the day and this version of Elektra bears no resemblance to this character.

Shoveling in the relationshippy/mother-daughter angle into what is supposed to be an action movie about a ruthless assassin turns Elektra into a ""kick ass chick flick"". Well, I've nothing again kick ass female characters. I enjoyed the original issues of Daredevil with Elektra, heck, I even enjoy Xena, but this movie is so poorly made that everything about it just bores one to death. It's by the numbers movie making and hits all of the cliches dead on: grimacing Asian assassins, the stoic blind teacher, the tortured female hero torn by love and family and a desire to ""settle down"". Yawn.

It's exactly this type of mundane super hero movie that WATCHMEN was created to counter.

2226129,5,B0007P0Y7W,"The style of this movie reminds me of adult Japanese animation in the Samarai tradition.  I liked the surrealistic montages and found them to be well coreographed.  There were some interesting plot twists that added to the story, though sometimes the plot was a little hard to follow.  Without having seen the end of the Daredevil movie and figuring out that they were bringing Electra back to life, I would have missed an important piece to the plot.  Even so, the visuals are very beautiful, the camera work was excellent, the music fit the scenes like a glove, and there was enough time devoted to human interaction to get a sense of most of the characters.  I have found most modern action film is too much on blowing things up and too little on the human interaction part.  This movie is more balanced in this sense, though I would have liked a little more time on some of the side characters.  Although the plot is interesting and reminds me to classic comic book type plots, I felt that the plot was mainly to give some coherence, continuity, and meaning to some fairly long scenes which were done very well.  It is not the action, conflict, and resolution formula of a usual Hollywood film, but more of a surrealistic montage of images and scenes that highlight the psychological angst of the main character.  I found the martial art scenes to be well choreographed and was happy that they did not go overboard with too much fighting.  I liked that pacing was slow and communicated a more dance like quality to the fights.  I was impressed with whatever training Jennifer Garner got that made her shine in those scenes.

The shadows that twists and turns the soul of Elektra are not heavily delved into, as the focus is on action. Garner has a striking presence, but is underutilized due to the character never fully stepping away from the comics.

The bonus material is outstanding, with a documentary on the character - which includes an interview with Frank Miller - and an in-depth ""making of"" documentary and film commentary by director Rob Bowman and editor Kevin Stitt.

Ben Affleck was effectively blind and dysfunctional as Daredevil; Christian Bale much less appealing (in my humble opine) as a wimpy Batman.  But when it comes to a super hero who can simultaneously kick arse and hold a guilt-ridden pity party, no one can hold a candle to sleek bombshell Jennifer Garner; not only that, she wears a red outfit that makes Viagra a mere breath mint, and she moves and grooves in ways that make ELEKTRA serve its very own call of the wild.

The plot is campy and goofy, but name me a super hero plot that isn't.  Garner's Elektra is a professional assasin (what a way to go), only she's taken a gig she can't complete; meanwhile, she's pitted against some supernatural ninja-types (talk to the Hand) who share a commonality with her high-drama past.  She fights, she pouts, she swims to relieve her guilt, then--like all action heroes--she comes back from near-death to become an invincible villain mauler.

Garner makes this film so much fun to watch; she's beautiful, graceful, exotic, and deadly, and I want to take my next vacation in her dimple.  Heck, in that outfit she could just stand in front of a camera and read the phone book; I would not be entertained any less.  Jennifer, sweetheart, you are my alltime favorite super hero as ELEKTRA.  And you've got the costume to prove it.

I thought that this movie would be an intense, butt kicking, action packed film with a hot chic superhero cutting her way through obstacles.  This movie has not left as strong of an impression in my mind, as most films do.  I only vaguely recall the plot and some rather boring scenes.

2226149,4,B0007P0Y7W,"The main reason I watched this movie was because Jennifer Garner was in it.

Jennifer Garner does not disappoint with her multifaceted portrayal of the emotionally scarred Elektra. During the movie we see tiny snippets of her past - a past that caused her to end up using her powers as a hit woman. She ruthlessly carries out hits until she is ordered to kill a single father and his 14 year old daughter. Instead she becomes their protector.

I think the only thing that made this movie watchable was Jennifer Garner's portayal of Elektra. It made an otherwise dull action film, more multi-dimential. We see her character heal and grow and that is ultimately the satisfying part of this movie.",1194998400,,694,4.7272727272727275

2226183,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Before watching this movie I did not know much about this character from the Marvel comics. Elektra died in ""Daredevil"", but she was brought back from the dead by the Masters. The problem is that now both sides, good and evil, seek her out. She is currently working as a gun-for-hire and is asked to go to an island and wait for instructions regarding her next mission. While she is waiting, she meets a father and daughter living in isolation and trying home-schooling. As soon as Elektra starts to get close to this people, she finds out that they are her target!

Compared to ""Daredevil"", I would say that ""Elektra"" walks more into the fantastic side, with elements of future seeing, the use of animals to see distant events and other supernatural powers. In this sense, it is more in line with other Marvel comics, like X-Men. The action scenes are not at the level  of ""Daredevil"" though, which is a shame, since Jennifer Garner is the perfect choice for this type of scenes.

Elektra has flashbacks from her childhood and we also get to see some of the events that developed between the time she was brought back from the dead and the current moment. This gives us some information that is helpful for understanding this character, but the development stops there. I would say that overall the film is OK, and allows us to spend some time entertained; but that is all there is to this production. If you are a fan of Marvel, then you definitely have to see it, but for the rest of you I would say do not bother.",1187308800,,1517,4.509090909090909

I have heard it is much better than the original. OK now back to Electra. This movie is boring, stupid, poorly acted and.....do I need to continue? They should have worked on Daredevil 2 instead of this piece of garbage! Unless your a completest Marvel movie nut,avoid this one at all cost!",1182038400,,613,4.63302752293578
2226185,1,B0007P0Y7W,"If you liked the theatrical cut of Elektra, you might be wondering: is it worth the money to buy the director's cut? I would say no. Differences in the two cuts are minimal. If you've seen one, you've pretty much seen the other.

Director Rob Bowman writes that he spent approximately 14 weeks ""personally handcrafting the movie [director's cut] for home theatre"" in that he ""re-color-timed every shot, changed some of the music, added in new footage, added visual effects"" and remixed the sound specifically for a home theatre system. Maybe when you're as close to the work as Bowman all that makes a great difference, but as the end recipient of all that effort, honestly, I can barely tell the difference.

So if the director's cut itself isn't worth the price of admission, what of the special features on the second disk? They're fairly lame. I was especially disappointed by the history of Elektra in comics. On several Marvel movie DVDs lately an ""extra"" has been an in-depth history of a particular comic book/character, from its beginning to the present, and interviews with many of the creative folk who've worked it over the years. In particular the retrospectives on the Punisher and Avengers were both excellent.

That is not the case with the Elektra retrospective. The interviews with important creators (Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, Bill Sienkiewicz, Brian Michael Bendis, Greg Rucka) are all there, but the material is presented in an extremely disjointed fashion, and there are many obscure references to other creators, other storylines, other industry personnel spread throughout that are never followed up on or explained. This will all be horribly confusing to anyone but a long-term, hardcore comics fan. I've been collecting comics for decades and have read most of the stories featuring Elektra so I was able to follow what was said; actually there was little here that was new to me. But as I watched this thing I was struck, again and again, by the thought that, had I been simply the average, non-comics-geek moviegoer, there were so many moments when I would have had no idea what they were talking about.

As to the Elektra movie per se, I liked it. And that surprised me because I despised everything about the Daredevil film including Jennifer Garner's Elektra. The Elektra movie is much better. I have to give Garner credit, after the critical drubbing and mediocre box office response accorded Daredevil, for having the guts to revisit the character. Having now watched her play Elektra in a decent movie, I realize that in Daredevil, along with everyone else in the film, Jennifer Garner was simply the victim of a bad script and director.

I give the theatrical cut of Elektra four stars. Not a great movie, but a pretty darn good little super-hero flick. I give the director's cut one star, not because it's any worse than the theatrical cut, but because it's not significantly different, thus can't justify its own existence.",1180483200,6,2962,4.9397590361445785
2226186,4,B0007P0Y7W,"I put off seeing this movie for over two years because it had been so widely panned by both critics and moviegoers.  But, I  rented it as part of a two-for-one deal at my local videostore and was glad I did.

Is Elektra a great movie?  No.  But it's good.  Make no mistake, Batman Begins was a better film all the way around, but Elektra had similar elements, particularly in the back stories (both heroes lost parents when they were young, both were trained in ninjitsu and other martial arts.)  Elektra was a bit darker, for lack of a better term, than other Marvel comics-turned films such as The Hulk, X-Men or The Fantastic Four.

In essence, Elektra is a martial arts film.  It has many asian elements and themes.  While many comic book superheroes acquire their powers by mutation, radiation or some other technological disaster or circumstance, Elektra's powers are mystical and learned, giving the story an eastern, not western, flavor.

The action sequences are well done.  The scenes are nicely shot.  Very little of what takes place is so unbelievable as to be silly or ridiculous.  Jennifer Garner brings much of Alias to this role but it works.

I'm not sure I would buy this movie but it's worth a rental, especially if you like action/adventure films.",1176681600,5,1267,4.7214611872146115

2226191,4,B0007P0Y7W,"It is unfortunate that this movie was not given a closer look in the theater.  Thankfully, DVD is a perfect place for fans and newcomers alike to discover Elektra.  The director's cut is a subtle and yet effective recut of Elektra.  I think that the theatrical release was disappointing to some because they were expecting a total action movie - more ""four color,"" and what they got was more of an emotional character study of Elektra.  The director's cut emphasizes this even more.  The commentary is very interesting - it reminded me of the Daredevil commentary.  It seems that directors often do not have the control that we might think they do over the movie, and Elektra was no exception.

I thought this was very well done.  OK, it's no ""Spiderman 2"" or ""X-Men"" but it's not a bad film.  The movie looks great - providing a second disc for the extras means the film looks really sharp.  The extras are plentiful.

2226227,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Director Rob Bowman's latest film gets a lukewarm review from me. It seems that Bowman's real talent lies in television sitcoms where his abilities have been exemplified in over 30 X-Files episodes, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Quantum Leap, and various other (forgettable) shows (like Baywatch).

I'm not sure what the screenwriters were thinking when they conjured the screenplay up. To be honest, upon one viewing of this film, I'm unsure as to whether the screenwriters even read up on the character of Elektra and Frank Miller's work in molding the character.

Ever since Frank Miller took over responsibilities with Daredevil issue #168 (1981), he created one of the darkest, emotionally evocative, and moving characters ever created in comics. And with the comic series that premiered in 2001, she even took a darker turn. Elektra is a troubled individual, an assassin, hired hitman, one who lives for violence seemingly to replace missing puzzle pieces in her life.

...this movie seems to ignore ALL of those things. The Elektra I'm used to barely has a conscience; the film Elektra is pretty soft-core. The Hand in the comics are a band of hellish, devious ninja-types; the Hand in the movie are a bunch of Hollywood-style souped up dorks. There are more things akin to this...the film just misses the mark.

My other grumblings are as follows: the pace of the film was sluggish, picking up at times, but dragging for the most part. The other nitpick is the film is overly short for a 21st century non-family type film! It's 97 minutes long!!! By the time the action starts to pick up a little toward the end, it's already almost over!

I thought it was a little weird how in Daredevil, it seemed to suggest that had a sequel been released Matt Murdock would definitely be included. But I suppose we should all be happy that Ben Affleck decided to sit this one out. (I would compare his skills with that of Tom Cruise.)

Elektra proves to be an entertaining movie in the face of its sluggish and mediocre nature. But if you're not doing anything, it's pretty neat to check out although you probably won't want to ever watch it again. As a former avid comic reader, I don't know if it's just me, but it seems as if Marvel's movie company has REALLY been slacking lately, ever since The Hulk (which was absolutely TERRIBLE), and the lackluster Fantastic Four.

In 2004 along came Hollywood. In this movie Elektra falls in love with a nice single dad and teams up with his 14 year old girl to kick butt. The gritty comic book is so watered down I kept expecting them to have a slumber party and maybe even a pillow fight before taking on those pesky ninjas!

To be fair, there really is some good stuff going on here.  The effects are generally good, it's well shot, the action sequences are above average.  The acting, I'd say, is acceptable; but that leads me to my next point, the writing is just poor.  There's not much of a story at all.  That forces the film to commit the mortal sin of being just dull, unengaging and completely uninteresting.

Garner has been critized on 'Elektra' for seeming like she was just phoning it in, I differ from popular opinion on the point that I think the cast seemed to do the best they can.  I just don't think there's anything here to really work with or for the audience to get behind.

When all is said and done, the whole film just has no real substance to it and comes off feeling more like a contract obligation then anything else.

The girl is physically fit and has the body and the moves but she is just a poor actress and does not fit the part of the Greek assassin. That said, Terrance Stamp is good as Stick her mentor but they do not portray him anything like the character in the comics. The character of Stick was a foul mouthed mentor who would as soon cuss Elektra or anybody out as look at them. They add Typhoid Mary, a really cool character and played by a beautiful actress, that wasn't even in the Elektra comics but in Daredevil. They also don't portray the character as she was written, a homocidal schizophrenic who is a mousey Mary and then turns into a crazy serial killer Typhoid who hates men. Stone, is portrayed as an indestructable hulk of a man but again they go against the comic by making him part of The Hand, the evil Ninja clan, when in the comic he was with Stick and The Chaste. Garner is just not right for the part. She doesn't have the look and the costume is weak.

A demon with skin of rock, a demon with living tatoos and a woman with a poison kiss...hmmmm. . . . identical.

You can also delve deeper: Kimaguri (closest I'll get to spelling it right) in Elektra is an art that allows its masters to bring the dead to life.  Sounds a lot like the reincarnation skill that Lord Genma possessed as well.

But, that all being said, this movie is as good as a movie that could have been done after the Daredevil fiasco.  Personally I had more fun picking out the Ninja Scroll similarities than actually watching the film.  Definetly a renter not a keeper.

This movie on the other hand has clear, crisp cinematography, fun well-choreographed fights that show off Garner's martial arts prowess, efficient and quick storytelling that never feels long and drawn out and nice decent-length takes during the fights that aren't afraid to be over-the-top, unlike Batman which seemed to try to hard to make the fights too realistic.

2226258,4,B0007P0Y7W,"Away with the negativity because ELEKTRA is truly not that bad a movie. Its worth four stars in my opinion.

I guess people complained about the long times where action was not shown, but rather, character development. I am truly saddened by this because people can't seem to look past the flare moves and look for a believeable, well made character. The movie shows human growth in Jennifer's character, particularly finding her conscience and her purpose. She started as someone who just killed no matter if she worked for the good or the bad to being someone who can make choices between good and evil, and knowing how to use her skills for the betterment of someone else's, not just herself. THe paradoxical idea of helping someone to regain her life made Elektra regain her own life is beautiful to know. I hope that someone finds this truly a beatiful theme.

Another is that Elektra is shown as human as possible. She has no super human powers but rather, she learned her talents. She was not born to know kimagure or the usage of sais. She had to learn them. She doesnt' have super human abilities like jumping extreme heights or having mutant powers. She was very much human and her actions reflect that human physics, true physics. When she jumps, she jumps in a humanly possible way, not zooming up the air like other superheros. She is grounded to that humanity and that is quite impressive to see.

Cinematography was okay. The direction wasn't all that but the tone is. Its the first superhero movie with that sullen, dark, consistent tone that is beautiful to watch. It made me focus on Elektra and her humanity. The movie isn't about how a hero saves others. Its about finding that hero's purpose and growing as a person. It is not about being someone who can save others or do great things but rather, it is about Elektra and how she was able to find herself and straighten out her life.

WIth that, I hope I have convinced everyone that the movie is not that bad. After I watched it actually, i sort of stopped a while to digest everything in, the philosophy, the moving elements. Other superhero comic book movies don't give me that. THey just give me brainless eye candy that leaves me unsatisfied.",1137024000,4,2218,4.621827411167513
2226259,3,B0007P0Y7W,"After seeing the theatrical version of Daredevil, I was a little skeptical when I thought about seeing ""Elektra"" (see my Daredevil review for further explanation). However, after seeing the flick I have to admit that it wasn't bad. The story was pretty decent and the action was cool. Jennifer Garner did a pretty good job too, although I could have done without the annoying and obviously fake green contact lenses she wore. At any rate, Elektra is an entertaining movie not a bad comic adaptation at all.

This DVD Director's Cut has very nice extras as well. I especially loved the Frank Miller interview in the ""Elektra the Comic Book Character"" documentary. It is interesting to hear how he first developed the character how she has evolved through the years. The ""Elektra in Greek mythology"" documentary is really good too.

All in all, this movie is a good purchase; I think you'll like it. Caesar says thumbs up!",1136332800,6,920,4.8164556962025316
2226260,4,B0007P0Y7W,"Because of the lukewarm critical and box office reception to this film I went into it with diminished expectations.  Much to my surprise this film has incredible depth.  The action scenes and special effects seem perfunctory compared to character developement here.  Elektra (Jennifer Garner) begins the film as an either indifferent or amoral assassin for hire accepting any assignment that pays.  It's when she accepts a job where she is to terminate a seemingly innocuous father and daughter that she examines the choices she makes for good or evil.  Garner is excellent in a low-key way in portraying the conflicts and contradictions that are Elektra.  The best way to approach this film is to divorce from your mind that this is a spin-off of ""Daredevil"", another underrated film, or that it has it's origins from a comic book.",1136073600,4,832,4.992753623188406

2226263,4,B0007P0Y7W,"If you are looking for a Jacky Chan style constant fight scene, then look elsewhere. But if you want some humor, subtlety, and brains with your brawn, then you might want to consider this unusual action movie. While some call the pacing slow, I actually very much like how the story unfolded and built up momentum. There was some very good character development and real tension between Elektra's old life, and where she might go next. Jennifer Garner's acting is nothing short of amazing. There are only a few negative things I found about the DVD, and they didn't really hurt my viewing enjoyment much. First, there seems to be way too much material to make a plausible single movie about Elektra.  I would rather have seen them do a trilogy. In particular, I think it would have been very interesting to see more of the earlier Elektra in action, rather than have some character describe what she was like. Given that they could only make one DVD instead of three, then I think they did a pretty good job. Second, some of the editing on the fight scenes is a little choppy.  I understand what the editor and/or director were trying to achieve with this approach, but I would have rather seen them use different speeds rather than lots of cuts. As a DVD viewer you can overcome this problem as I did by playing the big fight scenes at half speed after watching the whole DVD at full speed.  At half speed you can really appreciate the wonderful fight choreography and the skills of those performing the fights. Aside from these minor problems, I found this DVD very entertaining, even more so than Dare Devil, which had some flawed computer animation which broke the otherwise cool feel of the movie, because I think Jennifer Garner makes a better lead character, and because I actually like this script better. That being said, I wish they would make more Dare Devil and Elektra movies as it would be fun to see more of these interesting and complex characters.",1134172800,6,1964,4.637931034482759
2226264,4,B0007P0Y7W,"I was surprised how well this movie was. I watched the movie Daredevil, and loved it. Then when Elektra was made I just had to see it. I was sort of confused though because I thought Elektra died. She came back to life though. I liked the movie and thought it was made very well. It was definetely action packed! I thought it was cool how Jennifer(Elektra) kicked the other people's buts! If you haven't seen it, you should!",1133222400,6,424,4.379746835443038
2226265,3,B0007P0Y7W,"""Elektra"" is one of the weakest entries into Marvel's recent string of films based on their comics.  I'm basing that statement on the fact that I've seen all of these films (from ""Blade"" to ""Fantastic Four"" and all of the adaptations and sequels in between, including both ""Punisher"" flicks).  Although it is a step above ""Hulk"" and miles above Dolph Lundgren's version of ""Punisher,"" this film isn't quite as good as the film that it was born from, ""Daredevil.""  Granted, ""Daredevil"" wasn't a real gem compared to its peers, but the character did have a lot more development than found in this film.

""Elektra"" starts off fine enough, with a high body count that is sure to get any action fan a little giddy.  However, after this initial look at Jennifer Garner's title character at work, we are dumped into a long, drawn out and quite dull series of flashbacks and a sad attempt at the development of a plot.  When the action is on, this film is at its best, although some of the kung-foolery gets a little silly at times (especially the fight involving way too many bedsheets).  There are plenty of villains, but no one ultimate baddie.  Collectively, the villains are known as the Hand.  I'd love to have seen Elektra go at it with Cary Hiroyuki-Tagawa's character, who really seems to be a bad guy in the wings.  Instead, Garner tackles a motley crew of a tattooed warrior, a chick with really strong breath, and a murdering ninja with lightning-fast moves, as well as a number of other, lesser villains.

In the end, the viewer is left wondering just exactly what happened.  Why was Elektra so quick to protect the young girl and her father?  She had no clue why the Hand were after them initially.  Why couldn't she finish off some of the Hand while they were tracking their target?  She finished many of them off quite quickly when she put her mind to it.  There are a few other questions I could mention, but they may reveal too much.

In closing, this is a ho-hum flick that tries too hard to be both an intellectual film with all of the flashbacks and an action flick.  What you end up with is a fluffy action flick with almost no plot development and zero character development.  In fact, this film had an advantage over other first films for comic characters:  no need to develop the main character.  That was done in ""Daredevil,"" which I have to give credit for building up two superheroes in one film.  That's the one thing that all comic flicks have to fight with initially.  ""Elektra"" didn't even use that to its advantage.  Instead, it played out as if it was looking for a plot, or at least a good reason, for our heroine to do what she did during the film.

I only recommend this flick as a purchase to hardcore ""Elektra"" fans.  You may want to buy it if you, like me, are a completionist and just have to have every Marvel flick on DVD.  Otherwise I'd rent this film before laying any cash money down for it.  It's okay, but there are plenty of better comic flicks out there to purchase.",1133049600,,3008,4.5
2226276,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Elektra was a fun movie after all was said and done but it seemed kind of empty in many parts.

First off, the plot and emotionally disturbed main character seemed a bit thrown together. It happened so quick and seemed overly rushed.

Elektra began protecting the little girl and the ER doctor without having a clue why. The man could have been a serial killed for all she knew but yet she was saving his life!

Only later on does she find out that the little girl with the Wonder Woman lasso is the so called 'Treasure' that everyones after...

And the dialogue? Ouch!

That little girl was so annoying and her father had as much dialogue and lines as a table stool. The bad guys didn't have any memorable lines either...

Still, the movie was fun largely because of the varied cast of enemies. I thought the bad guys had awesome powers and uniqueness between them. The tattoo guy and female Typhoid were particularly awesome.

Still, in the end this was a short and fun movie. Be sure to watch it on cable if you can or pick it up on dvd if you can get it for cheap. You shouldnt be too dissapointed. :)",1133049600,,1105,4.334951456310679

When the DVD come out I ran off and bout it right off. I was again disappointed. There like very little on the DVD other then the movie. And in the deleted scenes we see a Matt/daredevil dream that was not in the movie for time. I don't buy that the movie is less then two hours.

When I saw a Director's cut was coming out, I had to hope for something more. I am much happier with this cut. It all makes a little more since to me.

I thought it was a good film it just had a lot of plot holes. So now here's the new and improved ""Elektra"". I watched the revised film and it honestly felt just like the first version. The changes weren't drastic. There are some extended and reimagined scenes. But the same questions still remained like why do the Hand ninja go up in smoke? More information on ""The Treasure"" please? And I would've taken the opportunity to cut out some uncessary scenes like that pathetic fleeting romance fling between Mark Miller and Elektra. On the plus, the new scenes do improve the quality of the film. Check out the enhanced ""kimigure"" scenes and a nice extended scene at The Hand's headquarters. It's also not the gorefest that some people rumored it would be. It's just as bloodless as the original version. Overall, this director's cut version is a good improvement over the original version.

I have not seen the special features yet but the fact that it's on a seperate disk means that there are bigger and better documentaries than on the original DVD release.

I bought ""Electra"" and then learned that a special edition would be forthcoming... and it would also be an unrated edition. So, the question came up in my mind as to if I should go ahead and buy this ""extended"" cut and after reading what other people had to say abut it, I came to the conclusion of ""no.""
Don't get me wrong, the movie Electra was decent fare. I enjoyed watching Jennifer Garner face off against some intersting, yet underdeveloped, bad guys. The special effects were pretty cool(although the sheets in the foyer scene was a bit much for me to accept beyond CGI fakeness) and I think that the story was really not all that bad. This hero was a conflicted one... torn between doing bad things for money to people who actually deserved their fates and actually doing some good by standing up against those who would normally hire her. But...
Why do Hollywood execs feel the need to take more money from fans who bought the movie because they liked it so much. I did enjoy it... but let me tell you... not enough to buy it twice. This has become a sad money stealing trend... releasing films and then shortly after cutting a ""diectors cut"" or ""special edition"". Sin City is a good example... a new edition is set to be released soon... Or even LOTR which now has three different variations to it.
Why can't these ""Expanded"" or ""Unrated"" editions be made available right away? Or... maybe on the DVD released there should be a sticker that says ""Special Edition forthcomming"". Something!

What I want to say is that I am not a filmaker so I think I can't say that a movie is bad. It must be a great effort to do it so I think that everymovie has something. Elektra is a great movie because it was designed to give you fun and to give you a little bit more than that. It's not an art movie. I can't expect something more than entertainment and fun. The story is not bad -in fact, it has great moments- and altough it's very different from the comic-book, it's a pleasure to see her in the big screen.

The problem with Elektra is Not jennifer's acting ability, she's great.. the problem is the storyline itself...there's no depth there just one straightforward plot and goal and that's it and this was the movie's greatest downfall. I'm not saying that the movie was completely bad but more delopment could have been done to create a deeper story to engage the audience more.

True... in the movie there are a few great scenes but just when you think things are gonna get real good the fight's over.... what's with that?

The movie was very slow at times... and then a great scence comes up and finshes too quickly.... there should have been more work done on this movie in terms of scrpt devlopment.

However the enjoyment of the villains ends too soon viewing Elektra an almighty being cannot be killed so with a simple throw of her dagger she can kill all the villains.

Yes, Jennifer Garner looked spectacular, but she sort of wandered through the film with a glazed look, probably wondering when the real script was going to show up. The ""bad guys"" where cliche, and some of them seemed straight out of X-Men and Spiderman. I am usually a Marvel fan, but honestly, I'm hoping that DC will bring us a really good Wonder Woman movie to redeem woman superheroes.

It had terrific fight scenes, a cool plot, grand villains, and Elektra herself was so beautiful it's not even funny! There was quite a lot of humor in it, as well. One of the best. See it and you'll have done yourself the greatest favor this side of female movies!",1122163200,6,351,4.0285714285714285
2226328,4,B0007P0Y7W,"For pure entertainment value, I thought this was a great movie.  Good vs. Evil, female superhero with hot red costume, villains with magical powers, martial arts action, dreamy fight scenes a la ""Hero"" and a valuable treasure to be protected.

On the surface, this movie swept me away with its action sequences and special effects, but then I got to thinking, and that kind of spoiled it for me.

Elektra (Jennifer Garner) at the beginning of the movie was the coolest thing in red ever.  She was like Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) from the first Matrix movie, unstoppable, inhuman, focused and deadly, plus she looked darned good in that outfit with her hair swinging around.

As the story goes, suffering from a bit of burnout, she accepts one more assignment, and then suddenly has a change of heart when she receives her hit list.  From here on, the writers strip away her intrigue and mystique, and it was disappointing to see a superhero suffer from OCD and insomnia, depend on an agent instead of a trusty butler, and generally get less and less super and more and more vulnerable.  She doesn't even don the red body hugger again until the end of the movie.

The bad guys then begin pursuing her new acquaintances, and she assumes a bodyguard role without even asking why one man and his daughter would be worth the effort.  After a lot of ta-da, she ends up back at the training camp of her sensei, who although blind like all good mentors, is not an inscrutable Asian with a long moustache, but a cranky white dude named Stick (Terrence Stamp).

This brings us to the best part of the movie, with a group of villains with real superpowers, who of course choose to attack one by one so that the good guys can save the day. Kirigi (Will Yun Lee) is a real martial artist, and two-sworded leader of the bunch; Typhoid (Natassia Malthe) can kill with a touch, and she almost sucks the life out of Elektra with a lingering kiss; Stone (Bob Sapp) is like The Thing, skin like armor and built like a barn; Kinkou (Edson Ribeiro) comes and goes quickly, and Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) is by far the most magical, with body tattoos with lives of their own.  These guys make the movie worth watching, and it's really sad to see them go.

Kirsten Prout handles herself very well as Abby Miller, the young girl that looks up to Elektra, and has a secret of her own, but Goran Visnjic doesn't have the satisfaction of a solid role to stand on.

Enjoy this one for the action, but don't pause to think about the plot.

There is very little exposition and what there is not very logical, but mostly the film functions as a live action storyboard with minimal dialog. The supervillains are pretty cool, though it's hard to understand how Stone was so easily dispatched. Jennifer Garner is lush to look at of course. Terence Stamp chews up the scenery effortlessly.

2226333,2,B0007P0Y7W,"Frank Miller's writing, drawling, and creating ablility was astounding, as with Elektra. Now the elektra portrayed in his comics is excellent. A charecter with emotional depth, you actually care about her. However, Unlike the comics, the elektra movie which taints his creation, the movie was that bad.

  This seems to be a trend in comics movies, as witht he recent FF movie. Guys, stick to the comics. That's how they were sucessful at first, don't go rewriting the whole orgin and look. And you wonder why it sucked? It was amazing Hollywood let it out of the editing room, (but they let Gigli out too, so no surprise there.)

  It looks promising from the opening credits, but goes downhill from there. i think they tried to pull too many elemnts on what made the Alias series sucessful for Jen and tried to recreate it here. Alias is good for the show, not for a totally different charecter.

  The cameo for Ben Afflect doesn't help, since Daredevil wasn't all that great and Ben Afflect, again, can't act. He's been in a long string of bad movies. You would think that Ben Afflect has a enemy like Bullseye is picking the worst movies out there for him. I haven't seen the directors cut, but it could not be thta much beter.

2226354,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Spin-offs are something of a rarity in Hollywood. Well, let me clarify that statement for a moment, spin-offs occur frequently in television, but with feature films they are far less common. When they have occurred in the movies they tend to not be as successful as the film or film series that inspired them. A few examples of spin-off feature films that had varying degrees of success or lack there of, are as follows: ""The Scorpion King"" (moderately successful), ""Supergirl"" (massive flop), and ""Catwoman"" (even worse than ""Supergirl""). So, with only a couple of decent successes with spin-offs (""U.S. Marshals"" would be another one), it strikes me as odd that 20th Century Fox would choose to make one based on their 2002 smash hit ""Daredevil"", instead of going with a direct sequel. Whatever the motivation, the decision was made to move forward with ""Elektra"", and the final product we were given was an average action movie, mixed with elements of other assassin-themed films, and almost no connection to the original film that introduced the titular character.

""Elektra"" picks up essentially where Elektra's story ended in ""Daredevil"", with her death at the hands of Bullseye. When all hope seemed lost, along comes a mysterious man named Stick (Terrence Stamp), a blind martial arts instructor that hopes to train and recruit Elektra to join him in an ongoing war against the evil organization known as The Hand. The Hand is also aware of Elektra and her abilities, and is just as interested in her joining their side as Stick is for his. However, Elektra's death and resurrection has left her cold, and she now uses the training she received from Stick as a means to become a world-renowned assassin. It's only a matter of time before Elektra's destiny catches up with her, and she will be forced to choose which side she will stand with.

As I said before, I doubt I'll ever understand the reasoning behind going with a spin-off such as ""Elektra"" over making another ""Daredevil"" film. I know that Jennifer Garner's character of Elektra was popular, especially amongst male audience members; however, I have a hard time believing that the response to her character was so overwhelming to inspire the suits at Fox to believe in moving forward with a movie focused solely on her. I know that critics were unkind to ""Daredevil"", although movie audiences were much more in favor of the film; but based on box office returns and an almost universal panning by critics, I don't believe ""Elektra"" faired nearly as well as a ""Daredevil 2"" would have among moviegoers. So, I wonder now, can anyone at 20th Century Fox say the words ""Colossal faux pas""?

The problem with ""Elektra"" isn't only the fact that it didn't make all that much money, but that it just wasn't on the same level as ""Daredevil"" or anything else that Marvel was placing in theaters at the time, or since then for that matter. The storyline was very simplistic for the most part, and truthfully, when the story stayed simple, that's when it entertained the best. When the story broke away from the simple plot and tried to get too complicated, that's when things first began to suffer. This was caused by the writers attempt at including a paper-thin psychological sub-plot for Elektra to deal with. Another set of problems for ""Elektra"" were caused by the lack of originality, brought on by borrowing heavily from other assassin-themed movies such as ""The Replacement Killers""; and lastly, all but severing all possible ties to the original film ""Daredevil"" that allowed this movie to happen in the first place. Now, the first two problems were troublesome enough to cause ""Elektra"" to lose points in my opinion; however, the almost complete omission of all things ""Daredevil"" bothers me the most. I know that many times spin-offs will not really do much to reference the original film(s) that created them, but most of those do not pick up part of their storyline wherever the original film left off. For that reason, I believe ""Elektra"" should have contained more than just a fleeting reference to the events of ""Daredevil"", and had they done so, I probably would have enjoyed this movie a lot more than I did.

I'm sure after reading that previous paragraph that you are probably thinking that I barely enjoyed ""Elektra"". Well, for some unexplained reason (and that's the God's honest truth, I have no logical explanation for why), I actually did moderately enjoy ""Elektra"". It doesn't make sense to me at all, but there's just something about it that still appeals to me, regardless of all the problems I have with it, several of which I listed above. I'm sure the appeal of this movie has something to do with the fact that Jennifer Garner (""13 Going on 30"") stars in it, but I know that can't be the only reason, because if that were the case, I'd enjoy ""Catwoman"" due to Halle Berry (""X-Men: The Last Stand""), and believe me there is no enjoying that movie at all. The only thing I can come up with is that ""Elektra"" is simply one of my ""Guilty Pleasure"" movies and nothing more.

Speaking of Jennifer Garner, she is one of the few bright spots for this movie, and I appreciated that she chose to reprise her role. Not to mention donning the bright red, skin tight leather costume this time around. I'm sure that the writers of the film, and probably even director Rob Bowman (""Reign of Fire""), had good intentions of giving Jennifer more to do than just appear somber and angry throughout the movie, in her defense she did always look great while acting as if she could kill you at any second, and no doubt the inclusion of the muddled psychological story for her character was an attempt to challenge Jennifer. However, even the best intentions can't always make things right, because aside from receiving a paycheck and having fun kicking butt onscreen again, based on what little else she had to do in the movie, I can't see any reason Jennifer would have for returning to this role.

Alongside Jennifer Garner, the rest of the performances in the film were a mixture in quality, with very few worthy of note; and almost all across the board everyone appeared somewhat disconnected from the material. I don't know if a majority of the cast was given instructions to be flat when giving their line readings or what, but something definitely did not feel right much of the time. The only other cast member, besides Jennifer Garner, that I enjoyed having in the movie was Terrence Stamp (""Superman 2"") as Elektra's mysterious mentor, Stick. For some reason, I enjoyed watching him, and it wasn't that he did a whole heck of a lot; it's just the way in which he carries himself, just seems to command attention.

One thing is for certain though; ""Elektra"" is by no means a great movie, in fact there were moments when I watched it that I found myself wondering if it's just barely above average. But, in the end I do feel that the movie does a decent job of entertaining me, and for that reason, as I said earlier, it warrant's itself a place in my favor as a guilty pleasure and not much more.

On a side note, 20th Century Fox did give ""Elektra"" the same treatment they gave to ""Daredevil"" by releasing a Director's Cut of the film on DVD. Truthfully, I don't know how much was added or was different from the theatrical release, but it does seem like there is slightly more story included, and the movie seemed to work just a little bit better.

""Elektra"" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
""Elektra: The Director's Cut"" is unrated and contains violence and language.",1120694400,,7556,4.744292237442922
2226355,5,B0007P0Y7W,"One of the best, most exhilirating and purely Enjoyable movies around.  Admittedly it's not as plausible as some of the other comic book adaptations have managed to be (the ""X-Men"" movies and especially ""Batman Begins"", for example), requiring a couple of suspensions of disbelief here and there (though I'd contend that it comes off as more believable than, say, the James Bond or Rambo series).  That's not a putdown on those movies but they're not trying to be ultra-realistic, and neither is this.  What it is going for, and succeeds at much better than most action movies in my opinion, is to be a rocket ride with a plot and engaging characters.  It's sexy, it's intense at the right times, sweet and tender at the right times, mysterious at the right times, and explosive allout action at the right times, with a welcome romantic angle and with good humor without becoming an unfortunate self-parody.

To be honset, it's not really accurate to the comic book version of Elektra (neither was her portrayal in ""Daredevil"") but that wasn't a fatal flaw with me like it would be with some other comic adaptations - the first four live-action ""Batman""s for example - five if you count the 60s one - were technically well done (uh, 3 of them were anyway.  The other 2 I felt missed the mark even on a technical level) but were disappointing because I wanted something far closer to the comics (and finally got it this summer!)  Elektra, on the other hand, I've read some of the books she's in and want to read more (I really must get around to the run of the series Greg Rucka wrote) but she's never been a personal favorite, and in fact I like this movie version of her quite a bit better.  Those who are really into the Elektra mythos from the comics the way I am with Batman or the Hulk or The Spectre or certain others may be disappointed by the differences.

I knew next to nothing of the plot of this going into this and liked it this way, as almost everything was unexpected that way.  People have complained that it was a slow starter; I prefer that it took the time to build itself up.  I'm going to opt not to say too much about the storyline - the box description is deliberately vague and I think it was intentional that people not know where this was going to take them when they watch it (too many movies today, including some of the greatest, give away far too much in their previews) although that may have cost it at the box office.  Personally, I'm inclined to wonder if it's part of a trend where action movies with female protagonists aren't taken seriously.  Not many seem to do the same mega-business as the big budget action movies with bigname male stars.  It doesn't seem to be like that with other fields of movies - horror, comedy, drama, etc. - but action with a female on the marquee seems to be a bit of a hard sell lately.  I thought it was a very good change of pace to have the female be the central figure this time around, instead of the backup.  If I, for one, was in death-defying danger, personally I think Jennifer Garner in tight red leather would be a fine individual to come to the rescue.

But as for who rescues who and who endangers who and what the sides are, not everything's immediately clear in this one.  There are some unexpected turns, and some great characters to take the those turns.  Speaking of characters, some of them I did recognize from the books, others I'm not sure if they were created for the movie or not.  Either way, there are some compelling players in this show.

I loved this, hope it does enough on DVD to warrant a sequel, and whole-heartily recommend it.  As noted, it's not the most true-to-the-book adaptations of late, but it's one of the best, and that's saying quite a lot considering the bumper crop of comic-derived movies over the last few years.  Excellent.",1120694400,6,3841,4.4949640287769785

- The Baltimore Sun

A Sleek Action Adventure!

- Chicago Reader

Here you have the box reviews for Elektra. But let's face it. Everyone but the box seems to hate the movie. The question is will I?

Well, it came of to a pretty slow start. So far the only thing I can tell is she has a bit of an obsessive compulsive disorder. Even JG in a bikini wasn't making this part of the movie all that good.

The flashback dreams to when she is a kid seem to serve no purpose whatsoever. I have to give her props on her strength and endurance though. She's able to do one arm pull-ups, and I can't even do two of them with both arms.

We're now twenty-seven minutes into the movie and this is extremely slooooooo[...] I thought this was supposed to be an action flick!

And the plot thickens! I now see the issue! I knew that sort of before it started but didn't really seem to care.

Okay, the first real action scene and it was pretty bland. Really short fight, a pair typical kung fu get your butt kicked loser dudes. Question is, when they disappeared into a plume of smoke, where did they go? They looked like real people to me. Another question is why would a bunch of Asians hire an American/Greek to learn their arts and try to take out someone? It makes no sense. I should point out I don't know the backstory behind Elektra, as to whether or not she debuted in DareDevil before spinning off into this.

Oooh, billiards! Best part of the movie so far! Well, the tattoo that flies was pretty cool.

Well, I just hit token funny part of action movie. Now a little bit later on, what I'm noticing in the thriller part is that the action is not even shown because of the rating of the movie (PG-13)

Well, it's a wonder we had the girl-on-girl kiss in a movie like this. Oh well, it so far hasn't even been enough to make this a decent movie so far.

I have issues with the dojo. Why would a blind white guy run a martial arts instruction school? He likes to speak like a proper English speaking Yoda as well. We learn that it was all a plot to get the kid into the school. Kirsten Prout looks like she could play a younger Jennifer Garner, which quiite possibly could be what they're going for here. I really don't think it's a subtlety.

Okay, these flashbacks to when she was a kid are really getting annoying. They better actually serve a purpose or this will prove to be a pointless waste.

Ooh, battle scene. Double sai vs. double katana. I wonder how many takes it took to get all the sheets to fall and not hit the main bad guy. Wow. Gotta love a guy whose tattoos can come to life.

Oooh, I know what it is! They're all vampires! They disappear when you kill them. Eh, maybe not.

And... movie over. Not even Jennifer Garner in red leather could make this one good. I'm certainly glad it was only a rental. They could have done more action scenes and supply us with a little more backstory other than ""she died in Daredevil."" People said Daredevil was crap, but I liked it, so I thought I might like this one. I didn't. I don't even want to waste my time with the special features.

I sat  waiting for it to ""start sucking"" and it never did. It was amazing.  Upon second viewing it reminded me a lot of  ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" but other than that (and the fact that it was too short) I felt that it was one of the best and most satisfying films I have seen in a long time.

The movie involves Elektra who having died in Daredevil, is brought back to life. She is an assassin for hire. However her job as an assassin seems to be more due it's all she knows what to do, than any simple desire to kill.

There is a wonderful scene near the beginning involving Elektra scrubbing the floor of her apartment. She claims she is doing it to get rid of her DNA. But one can really argue that she is doing so to get rid of her sins.

The creators claimed that they have taken from Frank Miller. But personally I think they used the revamped version done by Greg Rucka.  Millers' Elektra was a bit of nut and a femme fetal. Rucka's Elektra was lucid woman but clearly a woman with issues. And in this movie we can see Elektra struggling with her  demons and trying to reconcile her past (like Xena).

I felt that Garner did a lot better in this film than she did in Daredevil. While not conventionally attractive, her beauty shines through in her personality.

As is evidenced by her starring role in ALIAS. The woman is clearly meant to take center stage. She should be playing second fiddle to no one. Especially not an actor like Ben Affleck.  She has a wonderful presence.

Kristen  Prout  , as Abby is really terrific. She's so lovable as a bratty teenager. It's fascinating to watch her character develop as the movie progresses, and see how integral she is to the film.  And Goran Visnjic as Abby's father and Elektra's love interest. Was really good as well, he had a great ability to temper Elektra's restless and temperamental ways.

The DVD contains 3 deleted scenes. Which were wisely left out. Two because they would have given away a major plot twist. And the third, with Affleck, because it would have looked cheesy.

Anyway this is a great film. Don't listen to nay sayers, this is a great film for those who are open minded and are looking for a good time.",1117843200,3,2315,4.381733021077284
2226384,2,B0007P0Y7W,"I'm not a big comic book fan, but I was really looking forward to seeing Jennifer Garner in 'Elektra.'  Spin-off or not, it doesn't matter, for if you have seen 'Alias' series, you know Ms. Garner has star quality, and that she can not only act, but do great action stunts herself.

But ... oh dear, what happened?  Though Jennifer Garner's Elektra in sexy tight red costume is brought to life (thanks to her sensei Terence Stamp), the actions are not exciting as they should be, so-so at best, and the script is simply awful.  Tedious flashbacks showing Elektra's trauma as little girl?  Ninja-like villains whose mannerism is based psuedo-Japanese culture, and masterminds played by typecast Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Will Yun Lee?  I thought ninja characters are dead in Hollywood back in the 80s.

Besides the lifeless characters surrounding Elektra, the martial arts action scenes are heavily cut and edited, so all you see in action parts is a series of short bits (like 2-5 seconds), or creepy animals created with CGIs.  It's the worst type of editing, too fast, too MTV-like.

I find the unique team of the assassins -- Stone, Tattoo, Kinkou, Typhoid -- are very interesting (more so than Goran Visnjic and his daughter), and surely they could have provided exciting fight scenes, if pitted against Elektra effectively.  Well, they fight each other, Elektra and killers, but the fact is Rob Bowman fails to make good use of the assassins' abilities, and they vanish from the screen too quickly.  The only original thing about thrie fight is the deadly kiss -- of Elektra and Typhoid -- a sort of guilty pleasure.

The only good part of the movie was Jennifer Garner which put some flavor into the movie and was in fact perfect for playing the part of Elektra!!! I place all blame on marvel who basically focused too much on setting up for the sequel and less on the action!!! This movie had so much potential but in the end it was barely amusing!!! If you want the truth the only reason I gave this movie 3 stars was because, of pitty and Jennifer Garner!!! It was a nobel effort but there are way better movies than this!!! The special features aren't that special either and not worth buying the movie over!!! Some hardcore Elektra fans will have a special place in their hearts for this movie!!! Don't buy this movie because of Jennifer Garner, if you want to see more of her just watch Alias/ or buy the first season!!! Marvel used to be about making comics and pleasing their main fan group, but now they have turned into a bunch of corporate business investors trying to make a profits!! The movie ""Hulk"" was even worse than this, which makes this look good!!! If you are looking for good movies from marvel here are some suggestion:

Spiderman
spiderman 2
X Men
X Men 2
The Punisher
Daredevil
The Incredibles

I hope Marvel is wise and makes more movies like the one's listed above!!! I suggest you rent this movie first to see if you truly want it!!! If you are a action fan like me you will probably not like it!!! Better luck on the sequel!!!

Right about towards the end of this movie you start feeling like did I miss a scene because I just went to the bathroom for a second and boom elektra's fighting the last battle to save the treasure, for example in the beginning elektra is very tense and unable to show any type of emotion and then about 15 maybe  20 minutes into the movie without showing any interest or feelings she's kissing Goran Visnjic. I really think that elektra was put together a bit sloppy because it seems like the cast was willing to give everything they had and the crew just wanted to get everything done before lunch. The acting in this movie wasn't great it was like they were shooting elektra the tv series episode 15 not the movie and it seemed rushed.

Between the way the film is shot and her lack of moves, she comes off more as a model than an actor in this role. She was better in Daredevil... what happenned?

2226406,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Admittedly not a fan of Marvel comic hero stories or films, this viewer reluctantly watched the DVD of ELEKTRA as a trade-off for lack of other available films to rent. That being said, this vehicle for Jennifer Garner as the title comic book heroine is full of surprises.  Certainly none of the surprises are associated with the formulaic plot, a plot made worse with some mediocre script writing.  The pleasures are in the cinematography which detail elegant views of what appears to be the Pacific Northwest, in the presence of some very fine actors chronically underused (Terence Stamp, Colin Cunningham,  Goran Visnjic so memorable from THE DEEP END, and American Korean Will Yun Lee voted one of the world's most beautiful people in 2002), and in the nicely choreographed martial arts sequences which unfortunately are marred by victims swirling into sulfurous dust in demise.

The story is simply Good versus Evil, the Good being Jennifer Garner's pouty-lipped Elektra, Terence Stamp's dignified mentor Stick, and father daughter team of Visnjic and Kirsten Prout and the Bad being the Hand of Asian guys headed by Roshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), Kirigi (the dashing Will Yun Lee), and some truly obnoxious creatures such as Tattoo (Chris Ackerman) whose body art comes to vivid life as various demons, and the well-named Typhoid (a truly awful Natassia Malthe) who is a parody of the entire comic genre.

The thing that makes ELEKTRA work is the grounding of the film in natural settings instead of the usual hokey castles and dungeons replete with flying monsters and disintegrating planets. Though it will not make a believer out of those who have a low tolerance for the Marvel folk, it has its moments that satisfy the eye.  Grady Harp, May 2005",1116028800,,1755,5.013745704467354
2226407,4,B0007P0Y7W,"ELEKTRA suffered the same fate as DAREDEVIL. The studio took an R rated film and mangled it. The DAREDEVIL Director's Cut helped to save that film's rep to some degree. I hope the same thing will be true of ELEKTRA one of these days. I liked parts of the mangled cut a lot, but a Director's Cut is what I really want to see.",1115856000,,324,4.078125
2226408,2,B0007P0Y7W,"If there was an award handed out to the film with the most wasted potential, there would be several winners this year, but one of the runners up would be the film Elektra.  While there were some decent action sequences coupled with some very impressive villains, it was ultimately the unrealistic story and constantly changing characters that will leave your head lost in the clouds.  Throughout the film, Garner's character of Elektra is never defined.  As often as the scenery changes in this film, as does Garner's portrayal of Elektra.  One moment she is this heartless killer, and within a few short minutes, she is the most compassionate creature to be released by the comics.  It literally made no sense.  Who was she?  What was her true purpose?  Why (this is always a good question)?  Was she looking for compassion and love?  I have no clue, and this film took no effort to disclose the truth.  Instead, we are forced to jump back and forth trying to decipher these basic elements that were never covered in this film.  Couple with this some evil villains that were aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but that is all and you have the butchered comic release of Elektra.

My initial thought about this film was that director Rob Bowman didn't do enough research on this character to correctly bring her to life.  I have personally never read any of the comics, but I did see the film Daredevil, and I must admit Garner did provide the perfect opportunity to avoid looking at Ben Affleck, and I must say that I was interested in seeing how she was going to expand her character.  Let me tell you how she did it ... she took away any boundaries and borders.  Garner created this character that floated through each scene without creating any substance.  At one point she would be ruthless, then mere seconds later, Garner would show some sympathy towards one of the characters that would surpassingly seem out of character, because instantly she would transform back.  There was no definition with her Elektra, which allowed for confusion and miscommunication to those involved in watching this film.  Perhaps Garner wasn't quite comfortable in this role, or maybe the writing just didn't allow her to fully define herself.  Whatever it was it transformed Garner from this encrypted character to just a fumbled mess of thoughts.

With this said, one can also complain that this problem also occurred with the villains of this film.  I was so excited to finally see colorful and purely evil villains, that my excitement slowly died upon witnessing nothing happening with them.  There was no story, there was no moment of evil, there was nothing except a short glance of their faces followed by no lines coupled with impending death.  These guys were tough, and they had some superhero powers that Garner didn't even acknowledge.  It was yet again another glowing example of Rob Bowman not following through with the image of the comics and giving us ""dead"" characters.  After witnessing the ""flip-floppery"" of Elektra, I wasn't expecting it from the villains, but somehow they just appeared.  It then became apparent what Bowman had done wrong.  His focus was not on Elektra or her arch-nemesis, but instead of the graphics that were being created.  The story was weak, and I think Bowman knew that, so he spent a majority of his money on the CGI aspects of the film.  Which, strangely, worked.

I must give this film some credit, and that would be solely to the special effects crew.  I thought visually this film was entertainment, but when you opened your ears, the remaining element just forced this film to crash and burn.  Bowman knew how to make a visually appealing film, and he succeeded, but if he could have continued to add a very exciting and unfaltering story line, then he would have had a masterpiece.  Instead, we are left with a horrible portrayal of Elektra by Garner, coupled with the cheesy Terrence Stamp moments that seem to all-so-well accompany the weakest, yet visually stunning, baddies this world has ever seen.  It was just a hodge-podge of troubles, and at the helm was director Rob Bowman.

Overall, I wasn't impressed at all.  There were moments during this film where I thought it was going to go to a whole new level, but instead it just created a double negative effect.  In essence, the ""fun"" scenes were cancelled out by less important, nearly muted scenes.  Garner tried, but ultimately failed as this superhero.  She had the potential to really take this character to new levels, but thanks to the backward mind of Rob Bowman, she was unsuccessful.  I truly believe that the focus in this feature was pointed in the wrong direction, do not give us the best camera shot known to man, but instead powerful characters and a believable (and less Hollywood) plot.  This will give us a stronger character in the long run.  The largest disappointment to this film was the characters that felt as if they were forgotten about.  While I will never say that Daredevil was a better picture, but there are plenty of comic book films that do a better job of bringing their images to life.  Skip this one and go see Sin City.

The movie is SO FAR removed from the essence of Elektra as potrayed in the comics.  She's an assasin based in the city. And this movie is more Amityville Horror than about an assasin.

Don't get me wrong, the acting, direction, CGI is great, but if you are a comic book fan and looking for Elektra the assasin (who's in this weird love/hate relationship with Daredevil), look elsewhere.  This movie is a standalone, Jennifer Garner fantasy CGI action film.",1115683200,,622,4.627272727272727

""Yeah.""

""Why?""

""It's what I'm good at.""

""That's messed up.""

""Yeah."" - Abby finds out that Elektra puts the ""ass"" in assasin in ""Elektra""

Based on the  Marvel character from the film &  Marvel comic book ""Daredevil"", ""Elektra"" has Jennifer Garner reprising the role of the ninja assasin in this lame followup.

After her unspecified ressurection from ""Daredevil"", Elektra is contracted to put a hit on a young man & his daughter during the Christmas season. But when she gets to know her targets and the girl reminds her to much of her youngerself, Elektra can't go through with the assasination and calls her contractor, calling off the deal. The contractor, unhappy of this sudden announcement, sends supernatural reinforcements to dispatch the trio, & no, its not Santa Claus. Its up to Elektra to save her and the pair & make it to the New Year.

""Elektra"" has quite a few plotholes. The main one is how Elektra was healed after the sadistic beating, & severe stabbing she recieved from Bullseye during the last half of ""Daredevil"".

The acting is lame & half hearted. Garner trys to come across as tough, but, is unconvincing. Terrence Stamp is Elektra's master, Stick (as ""in the mud""). He reminded to much of Splinter from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to even care about his problems.

As for the character herself, ""Elektra"" was always a supporting chracter to ""Daredevil"" & only recieved her own book after she got a cult following. The stories are o.k., but, nothing groundbreaking. Just like this film.",1115337600,5,1561,4.849056603773585

I rented it this week, and I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It was much better than Daredevil. More character-driven. And Jennifer Garner did a fantastic job with the fighting. I enjoyed it as much as Alias, much more than Daredevil, and as much as any other martial arts movie I can think of off the top of my head. If you like action movies, this is a good one.

Daredevil was a far better movie and I think they should have brought some of that movie into this, even if it just meant her remembering ben affleck's character. All it showed was her childhood and nothing concerning that part of her life in daredevil. It didn't really make a lot of reference to her coming back from the dead either.....I think this movie should never come out with a sequel.

2226435,1,B0007P0Y7W,"Although forewarned, I was not totally prepared for just how staggeringly bad this thing actually was. But in fairness I had to actually see it to believe it, because the suck level is beyond anything I could have imagined. Think about the producers of the second ""Charlie's Angels"" movie doing a remake of ""Enter the Dragon"" (with the Angels cast) and you get some idea of ""Elektra"". Wherever the $40 plus million budget ended up, it was not on the screen.

Even from its inception the idea was suspect. Since ""Daredevil"" occupies pretty much the lowest rung on the superhero ladder, that makes ""Electra's"" status subterranean; they truly were scraping the bottom of the barrel. Add to this a really lame script (most cartoons have more subtle story lines and better dialog), uninteresting production design, poor lighting, and really bad direction and you can at least figure out why it is so bad.

But that leaves the mystery of why a studio, whose goal is to make (not lose) money, ever gave a green-light to the project. In may be that since comic titles like ""Elektra"" are basically sexploitation, the money people looked at the casting of Jennifer Garner and Natassia Malthe and saw huge sexploitation potential. Unfortunately someone forgot to tell this to the director and the DP because the filming of the two actresses is totally sterile (and they wonder why this thing lost money).

The movie's fight scenes suffer from ADD; each shot is a nanosecond long which negates any need for stunt work. choreography, or effects. There's even a showdown sequence where a bunch of laundry fights with the actors. At least this is original although it might have been used once in a ""Charlie Chan"" movie.

Jennifer Garner looks confused most of the time. Like they did a lot of tight shots on her face in the studio and then cut them randomly into action footage produced by the second unit. These reaction shots just make her look totally clueless. I was  surprised by how old she looks, hard to believe she is only 33. She has clearly outgrown this type of role and I felt embarrassed for her.

It seems inconceivable that ""anyone"" would find this entertaining although apparently a few people actually liked it.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1114732800,6,2263,4.7698209718670075
2226436,4,B0007P0Y7W,"I was sitting with a female friend of mine looking over a selection of DVDs to check out and we came across the latest martial arts superhero flick ""ELEKTRA."" Turning to me and pointing at the cover shot of Jennifer Garner she said to me ""Now, I'm not into girls - but she is HOT!""
And that is a major draw for this movie - that and the impressive action scenes in which Garner puts her ALIAS tv show fighting chops to practice once more in a heart pounding series of set pieces.
But the main attraction (acknowledged reluctantly by Garner herself in pre-release publicity) is Garners super-sexy physique, nicely accented by the skin-tight red outfit she wears in the movie.
Serious and thought-provoking drama this is not - but to its credit it doesn't pretend to be. Sure there is character angst on the part of Elektra dealing with the death of her mother and the inner turmoil over being assigned to kill a young girl and her father. There is a lesbian subtext most visibly illustrated by the main female villainess giving Elektra (quite literally) the kiss of death and some character struggles on the part of the father and daughter. But for the most part the entire cast realize that this is pure popcorn fodder and act accordingly.
The plot (for what it is) revolves around the title character. An assassin for hire, she is a seemingly ghost-like figure who can evade high-tech security systems to get to her prey. Then while waiting for her next assignment she befriends a precocious young girl Abby (Kirsten Prout) and her protective father (played by Goran Visnjic). Eventually the orders arrive - the targets are the two. Feeling a connection with the young girl Elektra decides to protect them and the race is on as she attempts to keep one step ahead of the mystical criminal organization known only as The Hand.
Not surprisingly the actor who impressed me the most is the venerable Terence Stamp who plays Elektra's mentor Stick, also turning in a wonderful performance is the young Prout, who steals almost every scene in which she appears.
Directed by Rob Bowman, who proved he could direct action well in the excellent modern-day dragon picture REIGN OF FIRE, this movie moves along at a fair clip and does not outstay its welcome. Its not high drama or a romantic comedy - it's a no nonsense action flick that will appeal to ALIAS fans and most alpha-males who appreciate suspenseful, tension filled action scenes and shots of Garner in navel-revealing outfits.
The DVD includes three deleted scenes that  were ""deleted"" for good reason, a rather EPK fluff making-of documentary that includes both interviews with Bowman and Garner, a piece on Garner's time at the Comic Convention a rather nifty editing-room feature and the trailer. Hopefully one day when this movie has passed into cult-favorite status (as it is bound to become) they will get Bowman and Garner together for an audio commentary.
Until that day, sit back and enjoy some straightforward, good natured Jennifer Garner fun.

Blu-ray update:
The video quality of the high definition Blu-ray is quite good and not surprisingly easily bests its standard def DVD counterpart, even if its blacks are little too dark at times. The Elektra costume is a nice cherry red while the foliage is a rich green, and the detail is extremely textured. The audio presentation on the Blu-ray is also simply excellent, with a rocking DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround track that will put your sound system to the test. There are a number of cross-channel effects and the LFE channel positively throbs with energy. All around, an extremely effective audio presentation that is definitely better than its DVD counterpart.
The supplements are headlined by ""Reign of Fire"" director Rob Bowman and an interestingly making of documentary that is significantly longer than the film it covers. In two parts, the ""Relentless: Making of Elektra"" clocks in at 2 hours 20 minutes. But, there's more, we are also treated to a 52 minute ""Elektra: Incarnations"" documentary that examines Elektra in the comic books. There's also a 15-minute ""Elektra in Greek Mythology"" which details, variations of the Elektra story in mythology. Rounding out the supplements is over 13 minutes of alternate or extended scenes, 5 minutes of deleted scenes, 2 trailers and a 2-minute + multi-angle feature of the fight scene at the well.
So, the verdict. If you are an Elektra fan, or a fan of Jennifer Garner at her sexiest, this Blu-ray as a purchase is a no brainer. The movie itself is popcorn fun, if terribly written, and the supplements are probably the most extensive you are likely to ever see. If the price point is right you should add this Blu-ray to your collection.",1114473600,3,4711,4.850931677018633
2226437,4,B0007P0Y7W,"I liked Elektra for its intrigue, action, martial-arts motif, and, yes, the acting. Maybe I'm just soft on Jennifer Garner. She portrays her characters so well and with such a great heart, she elicits sympathy and support. You really, really want her to win every fight. And she does!

In comparison with recent comic book films, Elektra is not quite as good as Spidey 2 but much better than Daredevil. I didn't miss Ben Affleck a bit. The film is on par with Xmen 2. In fact, the viewer will recognize very similar handling of both special effects and special ""super"" powers of the villains: Stone, Typhoid Mary, and Tattoo, courtesy, I suppose, of the same director for both films.

Jennifer Garner is a heart-winner. She is beautiful, talented, and winsome. And so sweet. I must admit, playing a cold-blooded assasin like Elektra is a bit of a stretch for her- even her solid acting skills can't cover up that great heart and sweet spirit.",1114387200,4,942,4.703030303030303

I thought Elektra used cinema reasonably.  Still, I felt afterward that comicbook-superheroes-sent-to-film are a waste of time, and critically here is the case again.  I can even accept that a movie should create its own premise, but still this plot seemed to fling things at me just because they were cool, rather than because they had any justification.  Why make this story supernatural?  Because comicbooks can do what they want?  Illogical thinking.  When making a movie, the plot needs to have an internal association with the viewers.  If that association is not clear, you aren't doing them any good.

c) She's witnessed her mother's execution from what looked like a ""Goat Pagan-man"" reject from the 1987 Tom Hanks - Dan Aykroyd remake of ""Dragnet"".

d) She's been kicked out of ninja school because she's too good and her sensai is tired of her beating up his students.

e) There's an evil organization called ""The Hand"".

f) When you need a ninja sensai, go to your local pool hall; he's hustling the tables for change when he's not fighting the forces of evil.

g) And finally, there's a tribe of ninja rangers, dressed in white, which hangs out in the woods, and cannot defend themselves from a 13-year old kleptomaniac.

At this point of the film, you are saying to yourself, ""My God, how bad can this movie really get?"" Then something completely unexpected occurs. A band of villains are introduced, who have been employed by ""The Hand"" to recover ""The Treasure"". They look like a group of Circus Carney misfits; however, from this point on, the film makes a dramatic turn around.

The group is commanded by Roshi, an upcoming lieutenant in ""The Hand"" organization. His fellow accomplices include: Stone, Tattoo, and Typhoid. Stone is basically your impenetrable being, impervious to guns, bullets, or knives; however, he is quite susceptible to huge sycamores. Tattoo, by far my favorite of the clan, can morph the creatures which are stenciled on his body into life; and Typhoid, who possesses the Kiss-of-Death. She's quite bitter because at one time she was once ""The Treasure"".

These characters are far more interesting than Elektra, and in my opinion, single-handedly save this picture. I would have been far more entertained in watching this band of freaks try to take over the world, than having to suffer through the first thirty minutes of this film. My suggestion is walk into the movie late. Definitely a movie to be seen on the Big Screen; I felt I missed something having to watch it on my computer.

2226455,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Elektra entertained me for an hour and a half. Garner knocked my socks off. The whole thing seems a bit rushed since they snipped much of it down from an ""R"". The finished product isn't too bad considering how much this went under the knife before we got to see it. We could really use the lengthier ""R"" version of this one. There was clearly a better movie made involving these scenes.
Let us have it.",1113436800,2,402,4.302631578947368
2226456,3,B0007P0Y7W,"This movie wasn't bad, though I didn't feel the need afterward to kick myself for skipping it in theaters and waiting for the DVD.  I'll say one thing, ""Elektra"" is a busy little movie.  While entertaining you with the immediate (and fast-paced) story at hand, it also finds time to explain and update us on many aspects of Elektra's past, including how she acquired all those amazing fighting skills she displayed in ""Daredevil"", how she came back from the dead after the end of said film, how and why she eventually had a falling out with her life-saving benefactors and became the assassin for hire she is at the beginning of this film, etc., etc.  So, the movie does all that AND relates her big battle with the evil, mystical group known only as The Hand (the movie's main story), thus paving the road to her redemption.  And it does all this in a shade over 90 minutes.  Whew!

A longer, more epic-like movie- with a little more breathing space- might have been better, but who knows for sure?  It's important to remember, after all, that many comics fans weren't all that keen on Elektra's return from the dead in the comics, either (after her memorable death in Daredevil #181), and that some comics readers enjoyed her post-resurrection stories and some didn't.  So it feels kind of appropriate that the movie also generates ambivelent feelings along the lines of ""yeah, it's a good enough movie, but did they really need to bring her back from the dead?""

The often-talked-about (""it's in the movie... no, wait, they changed their mind and took it out!"") cameo appearance by Ben Affleck's Matt Murdock / Daredevil character is finally available for your viewing pleasure in the deleted scenes section, and it's very brief.  Essentially it's Elektra seeing Matt in a dream where he says ""Come back to me"" and she replies ""When I'm ready.""  That it's, fifteen seconds tops.  It was so brief that it was silly that they cut it.  It would have provided a nice bit of continuity while also demonstrating that Elektra hadn't completely forgotten or blown off her previous experiences with Matt Murdock.  Oh, well... at least the moment can been seen in some fashion now.

The amount of DVD extras are pretty much just right for an entertaining but ultimately- let's be honest- marginal film like this one... you get a few deleted scenes, a couple of featurettes, and a commentary (which I haven't checked out yet).  This may sound like a weird complaint, but I think that too often DVDs give you way too much in the ""extras"" department, more than most films actually warrant.  To me, that's almost as bad as DVD's that give you little or no extras.  The extras offered here, which are interesting and to the point, feel just right.

So, in the end, if you keep your expectations in check, I think you'll generally enjoy watching Jennifer Garner take on a variety of colorful villains for an hour and a half.  So go ahead, give this a whirl.",1113436800,,2944,4.679611650485437
2226457,1,B0007P0Y7W,"But I was hoping for to much.  The opening scene builds her up to be this super assassin that is unstoppable, this later proves to be fraudulant.  She stinks.  They say in the beginning that she whispers in the ears of all her victims....well she doesn't when she's about to assissinate the dude and that anoying chick by plugging them with a crossbow.  It's like they spent all the effort on the first 10 minutes and called it a day.  The fights seems are kinda meh.  It ends all stupid and luvy duvy.  I do kinda like the way that the hand ninjas(is that a parody of the foot?)turn into poison gas when they die.  I wish I did that, that would rule.  Don't see this movie because just like daredevil and ben affleck....it sucks real bad.",1113264000,2,739,4.335766423357664
2226458,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Being a comic book fan, I was never really into Elektra until I had heard rumors of production on a Daredevil movie.  I then began to re-read old Daredevil comics to get some history on the characters.  With this background research, I was ready for Daredevil.

I was ok with the Elektra in Daredevil since it was basically an origin film.  It showed her background and training, the death of her father, but rushed to her death without ever showing her as the assassin that she was in the comics.

Fast forward to this film, I was hoping to see that assassin in action.  Sure we got a glimpse of that assassin in the first five minutes of the film, but how cool would it have been to see just a little more of that, just to define the character and to gain further insight into the redemption that takes place in her life throughout the movie.  This has always been a problem with these Hollywood productions in that they don't think the audience can root for a villain.  I strongly disagree with this notion since some of the greatest onscreen characters and performances have been portrayals of villainous characters.  Just look at Marlon Brando or Al Pacino in The Godfather films for example.  Yet, Hollywood does not seem to get it.  Why else would core fans go to see an Elektra flick if not to see some cool assassinations and martial art fight scenes?

I will say that Jennifer Garner looked great in this movie and she came off as if she took this role very seriously.  That is the only way one can make a fantastical movie like this and not look like a complete fool.  Much like Tom Jane in The Punisher, Garner looked well trained and comfortable in her role as Elektra.  The special effects in this film were pretty neat and were seamless in appearance.  Especially in regards to Tattoo's character (Chris Ackerman) and the death that followed Typhoid (Natissia Malthe) wherever she went.

Much of the action in this film comes at its end but I did not find this to be a major problem.  All in all, Elektra is not a bad film and did not deserve the critical drubbing it received during its theatrical run. The best I can say is if there were a sequel to this movie, I'd go and see it.",1113264000,2,2197,4.422885572139304
2226459,2,B0007P0Y7W,"The inevitable spin-off of Daredevil, Elektra had gone through so many script re-writes that the final version hardly has any resemblance to Frank Miller's cold blooded assassin for hire, and instead we get a jumbled, fantasy-esque, predictable actioner with Alias star Jennifer Garner returning as Elektra.  There's really not much to say about the story, because there really isn't much of one, other than Elektra is resurrected and is soon protecting a man (Goran Visnjic) and his teen daughter from the Hand.  Fans who are familiar with Frank Miller's monumental Daredevil stories, in which he created and introduced Elektra, will be familiar with many of the characters; including Stick (Terrance Stamp), Typhoid Mary (Natissia Malthe), and Kirigi (Will Yun Lee), but those same fans will no doubt be wondering what those Daredevil characters are doing in Elektra.  I expected better from director Rob Bowman (Reign of Fire, the X-Files movie), but he probably didn't have much say in the matter.  All in all, Elektra is worth a look for comic fans, but don't expect anything good from it.",1113264000,,1094,5.129213483146067
2226460,5,B0007P0Y7W,"I loved this movie for its style, very serious, hardly any comedy in the movie. One of the things i respect this movie for is the less use of blood compared to other Marvel flicks, because while the other movies are good, they use way too much violence to try to appeal to fans. Elektra is very dark, in fact when i compare this to the rest of Marvels movies, this is the darkest. Jennifer Garner is stunning as Elektra, and so is Kirsten Prout who plays a very well done Abby Miller. You have to have an imagination to watch this film, because everything is exaggerated when compared to reality, like Elektra getting kicked in the face and flying through the air for about 20 feet.

Will Yun Lee and Jennifer Garners fight scenes, in my opinion, outdo most of the Marvel movies. Because not only are they using real weapons, but they are also doing their own stunts. The CGI is simplistic compared to Spider-man and Daredevil, but i think that is why it is so good. Because it gives the movie a very comicbook look.

A very low budgeted film, well atleast it's cheap compared to some of the recent films in theaters. Just breaking 43 million dollars to make, the low budget was mainly due to the fact that a lot of the enviroments they are in are real, some is stage, but most is real. Average box-office, 24 million in the U.S. I think it was mainly due to late advertising of the movie, but it did manage to gross 30 million around the world, same as the Punisher. But overall, box-office gross does not mean this isn't good, this movie is really good, in fact i think it is superior to some of Marvels other films.",1113177600,17,1618,4.354304635761589
2226461,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Okay.  I went into this movie expecting total stupidity, boredom, and pain (my wife insisted on seeing it.)  I'm pleased to say, however, that I was wrong.  But before you get your hopes up, it is by no means a great show, it's just isn't horrible.

Before the movie really starts we are given a little historical recap about the fight between good and evil, the leaders of each, and the ""chosen-one"" over whom they are fighting.  This little scene, along with the initial fight scene when Elektra sneaks her way into a secure compound and kills a bad guy, are so horribly trite and clich that I was worried about the rest of the movie.  But it got better.

Jennifer Garner does a great job of playing the hired assassin haunted by her childhood and troubled past.  The standard martial arts fight scenes, thankfully, are few in number and tastefully done.  The bad guys are flat characters, but are still really cool.  They're all daemons who explode into green dust when they die and sport cool features such as bullet proof skin, tattoos that come alive, and the ability to kill people by blowing them a kiss.

All in all, a fun film.  Nothing smashing, but worth watching once.

Enjoy!",1113091200,4,1189,4.578199052132701
2226462,5,B0007P0Y7W,"I'm usually a big fan of the more realistic superhero movies, looking back at Batman and Daredevil as examples. When I saw the trailers for the spinoff, Elektra, it threw me off because of the characters' abilities in the trailer.  That's one of the reasons I decided to not go see it.  After renting the movie, I'm sad that I didn't give the movie more of a box-office look.

Jennifer Garner returns as Elektra, who was untimely slayed in Daredevil. Being brought back to life, she now has become an assassin for hire and a lot colder as the result of the events in her life.  She almost shows no point of return up until she decides not to kill the new targets. Jennifer Garner did a great job playing this character.  She seemed to really be into it. The action sequences are great, one of which Garner suffered a pretty nasty injury in.  It reminded me of Daredevil, but it had an X-Men flavor to it.  Whereas the villains of Daredevil were more realistic, the villains in Elektra are more fantastical as far as abilities. But they made sense because of the storyline presented in the movie.

They left the movie open for a sequel, but I doubt it will given its box office gross.  The only hope it has is a big DVD/VHS account, or that a Daredevil 2 happens.  God knows Ben Affleck could use a big movie right now.  Jennifer Garner however has been undamaged by this movie.  In fact, her work in this movie can only help her growing career.",1113091200,4,1444,4.407547169811321
2226463,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Something to chew on...in Greek mythology Electra was the daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon who, with her brother Orestes, avenged the murder of Agamemnon by killing their mother and her lover, Aegisthus.  In terms of the comic book (or graphic novel, whichever you prefer) and the 2003 film Daredevil, Elektra (slightly different spelling) was a character who started studying martial arts at an early age, lost her mother much sooner than she should have, and began using her skills to become one of the world's deadliest assassins....in a nutshell (it's been a great while since I've read the comics, so this comes more from the film).  Directed by Rob Bowman (The X Files, Reign of Fire), the film stars Jennifer Garner from the popular television show `Alias'.  Also appearing is Goran Visnjic (Dr. Luka Kovac on `ER""), Kirsten Prout (The Love Crimes of Gillian Guess), Will Yun Lee (Die Another Day, Torque), Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Licence to Kill, Mortal Kombat), and Terence Stamp, whom many may recognize from any number of films including Young Guns, Alien Nation, and The Limey, but I'll always know him as the ruthless General Zod from the Superman movies...'Come to me, son of Jor-El! Kneel before Zod!'

The film begins by relating a whole bunch of stuff including how there are two organizations, Kimagure (good) and The Hand (bad), vying for the same thing in that of some sort of treasure that would ultimately shift the power balance one way or another (The Hand is interested in it for world domination purposes and stuff like that while the Kimagure are content with having it if only to keep it away from The Hand).  We also learn Elektra (Garner), who died the last time we saw her in the film Daredevil, has been brought back to life by her once martial arts Stick (Stamp), and has now become an assassin for hire, with her skills in high demand.  After taking on a lucrative contract, she discovers something within herself lost since thought lost, and can't follow through.  Not only that, but soon she finds herself in the position of protector, perhaps as an effort of redemption, as those who took out the original contract have since decided to bring in some big guns to finish the job in a team of deadly killers each with their own, unique power.

In terms of a movie based on a comic book character, I enjoyed Elektra, but that's not to say it didn't have some flaws.  I think the thing I was most impressed with was how the film looked overall, filled with stunning, rich, vibrant, and beautiful visuals.  Also, I thought the action very well done, the fight scenes sharp and exciting, and Garner sure looked good in that red outfit.  There were a few things about the film I didn't like...I thought the action through most of the film somewhat sporadic, loaded towards the latter half of the film.  Also, the actions scenes often seemed short and less comprehensive than I would have thought.  At some point in the movie we're presented with a fearsome group of killers in Stone (in RPGs he/she would be classified as a `brick', or a character whose size and strength usually dictate his/her actions), Typhoid, whose touch is death, Tattoo, who can bring to life the various deadly creatures inked onto his body, Kinkou, whose ability seems to be limited to being able to balance really well (what's the point?  When special powers were being handed out, this guy missed the boat), and Kirigi, their leader, master of marital arts.  They seem like a very formidable group and are feared by even those they work for, but they're quashed with relative ease at various points in the film.  And here's something else that disappointed me...near the end we're set for a huge battle, one chock full of ninjas, but then all the ninjas get popped as they're caught trying to enter through the same area, in one stupid bunch, and Elektra makes short work of them, barely lifting a finger in doing so...I thought the real `final' battle pretty good, but I found the inclusion of the swirling sheets rather annoying.  The dialog was pretty predictable, but maybe that's because I've read so many comic books when I was younger...and the character of Elektra...I thought Garner did very well, but maybe it was just the way it was written as I felt it never quite made it from what I remember from so long ago in that of an extremely serious character, focused and determined, not easily swayed by emotions or sentiment.  Ultimately the story is kinda weak (I never got the sense this was the `ultimate' battle between good and evil, and the `treasure' was really worth all the trouble), and not really deserving, but it was fun if you're not expecting too much, and if a sequel is made, I'll see it...

The anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture on this DVD looks excellent, and the audio, available in English (DTS 5.1) and English (Dolby Digital 5.1) is just as good.  There are a number of special features including a `making of' and Inside the Editing room' featurettes, a bit Garner filmed for some Comic-Con (comics convention) presentation, sneak peeks, and three deleted scenes, one featuring Ben Affleck as Matt Murdoch aka Daredevil.  Can anyone tell me what is the deal with some companies using cardboard slipcases over the DVD case itself?  Is there a purpose for this extra packaging?  They're nice and shiny, but the one for this film featured a giant hole in the back where the UPC code once resided.  This didn't really bother me, but others might like to save this part, and might be disappointed if all are the same.  Something else that bugged me...20th Century Fox slapped on this advertising that plays once the DVD is put into a player, one against pirating films from the internet and other sources...why in the world are they advertising to those of us who bought the damn movie?  If they're so concerned about it, go after those who do it and leave the rest of us alone to enjoy the movie.

2226476,3,B0007P0Y7W,"It's got pretty much everything I'd want in a comic adaptation - some fair fight/action sequences, over-the-top characters and effects, and Jennifer Garner's babe appeal. It's all safe stuff. The ""action violence"" is quite bloodless, since vanquished bad guys vanish in a puff of smoke instead of bleeding all over the place. Garner's ""Elektra"" costume does good things for her figure and for 14-year-old boys, but still covers better than what you see at the beach.

The plot moves along well. Elektra is hired to kill a man and his teen daughter. After meeting them, she decides not to finish the contract but to save them instead. Then the chase is on - and it turns out that Daddy and daughter are a bit more than Elektra signed up for. The whole assassination contract was a bit more than she signed up for, but you'll have to see that for yourself.

The bad guys are OK, but sometimes uninspired. Typhoid, for example, has the super-power of fatally bad breath. Tattoo has (you guessed it) tattoos - but his tend to wander away. Then there's a guy whose evil super power seems to be in being big. Not super big, just big. Also, there's a lot of detail, but not all of it seems to serve the plot. The OCD thing - how does that explain anything we need to know? The flashbacks were generally good, but a few failed to move the plot forward.

It's a good comic book movie, no matter what the critics said. If there had been fewer stray strands and bit stronger action, it might have been great. Still, it was good.

He also trained her to become a more powerful fighter, and she was stronger and better by the time she headed out on her own again. Jennifer Gardner is impressive, and it's obvious that she's done a lot of training for the title role this time.

Elecktra is haunted by traumatic past events and she's depressed and isolated. She came across a Abby, a teenaged girl and her dad in an remote island where she lived. Abby is the ""treasure"" meaning she's a martial arts protegee, and is being pursued by The Hand, a group of powerful evil people with special black-magics. Stick and his team is also secretly trying to protect and take the girl in for training. While protecting the girl, Elecktra had no idea of her identity until much later when the girl started to fight the villians.

The first half of this film is rather slow, and had very little fight scenes. The good battles are concentrated in the second  half, which had some good special effects. The villians all took their even share of screentime and fight scenes, and Elektra took on them on a at time. Terance Stamp is vastly underused in this movie, he didn't even have to do any fight scenes. Goran Visnjic(The Deep End) played Abby's father, and had love scenes with Elektra. His role was unfortunately underwritten and irrelevant to the story that he's best effort was not even working here.

A couple of years later, she is an assassin, killing for money. We have already seen her slaying a target. She boasts an impressive array of powers, leaping, kicking, stabbing and running her way through out the whole exercise. While clearing away the evidence of her massacre, McCabe her agent walks in carrying a massive bag of cash. He asks her whether she wants another job, offering A LOT of money two hundred thousand infact, at first, she is reluctant to do it, as she is pretty run down, but later agrees.

We learn that Elektra is plagued by nightmares, of her mother's brutal and timely death, and also when she was brought back, her previous troubles re emerge. When a kid, Elektra suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and since her resurrection, the disease has come back with a vengeance.

For the job, Elektra is living in a spacious, but cold apartment over looking the sea. Again, while swimming in it, sudden memories emerge of her father making her swim in a pool, for hours on end. When, she stops swimming, she goes back into her apartment and notices a shadow running along the corridor. She instantly assumes that it is a robber and hunts it down, but when she finds the culprit it is only a thirteen year old girl named Abby.

When Elektra and Abby meet again, Elektra is invited into her home for Christmas dinner. But when the house is invaded by demonic ninja's the friendly meting quickly turns into a fight for survival. Elektra has to ask herself, whether she is going to go along with her job, or help, these seemingly helpless friends.

The Hand is an evil organisation, who has been around for centuries. The only thing that could possible stop them is a special power that possesses one woman alone. As you can imagine The Hand, don't really want her to live much longer as they don't want her to have a chance at killing them. The demons that invaded Abby and her father's house are members of The Hand.

It quickly becomes apparent that Abby is not all she seems, and Elektra is going to have a hard time protecting her. The Hand latest assassins to try and defeat Elektra are Typhoid Mary, a women with the kiss of death (literally) Tattoo a man whose tattoos are really, really realistic, Stone, the heavy weight wrestler and the leader of the gang Kirigi a uber strong Japanese warrior.

What is Abby's deadly secret? Will she be able to bring The Hand to its knees? Does Elektra's tragic past have a link to her immediate future? You will have to pop down to your local cinema to find out.

I am a fan, of anything Jennifer Garner does. I think that her work on Alias is truly amazing, and in 13 Going On 30 she was instantly lovable, but it was when she first donned her black suit in Daredevil, that I first thought she was perfectly cast in a role. She does seem to ooze all the sexiness that the character needs, as well as being warmly affectionate and perfectly moody and glum. Also she has the body for such a physical role. I think her performance in Elektra is better than her one in Daredevil, as her character is allowed a lot more screen time. As an audience, we delve really deep into the whole persona and history of her character and Garner relishes that. It really did secure my belief that she is the best actress for the role. Garner turns herself into a bad ass heroine will the click of a finger and perfectly transforms into the role she is cast as. What was a glimmer of hope in the dark, and dismissed Daredevil, is now a fully blown flame in Elektra.

I can honestly say that I think this is a lot better than Daredevil, script wise. At least Zak Penn tries to delve as deep into Elektra's history as possible. I thought that it was written very well, especially at the beginning as it doesn't dive into action straight away, it lays down the rules, of the fight between The Hand and just about everybody else. I also thought it was fuelled by emotion, bringing in the aspect of Elektra's Obsessive Compulsive Disorder was a clever move as it buries the fear, that maybe her illness will stop her from winning a fight.

Rob Bowman, the driving force behind X files. Directs this film, with a lot of vision, and establishes, again emotion into the movie straight away, as he always plays on the audiences minds. I wasn't ever sure, what was going to happen next, and that goes as credit to him. He obviously has a talent for drawing good performances out of his performers. He brings in good pace, and always makes it a treat to watch.

Visually Elektra is clever. Using colour very well. For instance a lovely touch was when Elektra reveals her tight red suit, and all this long draping white cotton swirls menacingly around her. Always establishing a fear, that something unexpected could happen at any minute. The special effects are above average, but not stunning. Again a nice touch, was when instead of their being blood in the baddies, a scary green midst emerges in its place.

I thought that Elektra, although not extremely thrilling was one of the best comic book adaptations in a long time. Jennifer Garner was perfect, visually it was quite exciting, and a rocking soundtrack makes it a really big treat. I loved it.",1112918400,5,5451,4.534079348931841

2226481,2,B0007P0Y7W,"Elektra brings the audience down the beaten path of the fight between good and evil.  The struggle between good and evil is an infamous theme in storytelling, as it teaches moral values that emphasize kindness, forgiveness, and compassion.  Despite being a frequently recurring theme, it has a solid value to its audience, as it provides new perspectives of the wolf in sheep's clothing and continues to foster goodness in people.  Elektra tries to offer such a lesson through a troubled woman, who still lives in the past, as anger clouds her thoughts.

The good are represented by an organization led by the blind martial arts master Stick (Terence Stamp) who once taught the main character, Elektra (Jennifer Garner), to become a lethal killer that she is.  This might sound counter-productive, but the good side once tried to turn Elektra to one of their leading fighters against the ancient battle against evil.  This evil is led by Roshi (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) who is the leader of the feared organization called the Order of the Hand.  Yet, they are not as fearsome as one wishes in order to generate a suspenseful atmosphere.

Once the audience settles down with the main theme, the film introduces a myriad of side plots.  For example, Elektra has a troubled past, her obsessive-compulsive disorder seems like a way of survival, her job is as a hired assassin, and other character's have secrets.  There is also the Hands' pursuit for warriors to tip the balance in their favor such as Elektra while puzzlement surrounds Stick's relationship to Elektra.  These are many of the plots provided in the film, which reminds the audience of a crossroads with several directions to choose.

Unfortunately, the director does not develop these side plots or the characters. Instead, the filmmaker brings the audience through a rapid succession of images that are supposed to suggest ideas, thoughts, or something.  It feels as if much of the potpourri of thoughts diverges into a messy conundrum where much makes sense, but does not finish or offer any kind of message regarding how Elektra reaches her final solutions.  Much of it feels as if it is grabbed straight out of the air leaving the audience with a hollow and fabricated idea.  In addition, Elektra's choices occasionally seem to go against her character, and she does not seem to be the strong person that she is supposed to be.  This truly hurts the cinematic experience, as it does not provide a vision or meaning behind Elektra, the Hand, or others in the film.

The films is nicely shot with some intriguing cinematography, yet some of it will remind the audience about films such as Hero (2002) and House of Flying Daggers (2004) by Yimou Zhang.  There is also a little of Matrix (1999) slow motion in the film, which does not provide any real unique experience.  Ultimately, Elektra will make the audience experience a trivial super hero film while the character Elektra deserves a much better developed story that does not feel cluttered, or borrowed.",1112745600,,3020,4.932806324110672
2226482,4,B0007P0Y7W,"I walked into the theater expecting the worst from this movie, but hoping for the best. Being an avid Alias and Jennifer Garner fan, I wanted to the movie to succeed all of my expectations, and surprisingly it did. Although unrealistic, the action sequences were enticing and amazing to watch. The characters were unusual, yet interesting and despite being fictional, still faced the normal human emotions like jealousy and fear. The acting by Jennifer Garner was superb as always, but the acting of the young girl was what really surprised me. She was very convincing and believable. This was a great movie despite what the critics said and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action films.",1112745600,4,696,4.906779661016949

But she is going through a rough time in which she doesn't see the HUMAN inside herself.  AS an assassian she is given the job to kill a man and his daughter only to find out that she is the next generation of people who will save the world.  SO Elektra can not kill her because of that.  During the rest of the film we find that ELektra has indeed found her Humanity and self-respect again.  She now is able to live life as she was meant to.  With dazzling special effects and decent acting this movie is a more than entertaining film about self discovery.  However, it is choppy at points and never truely pushs its ideals onto the audience in which it is trying to please.  A movie that is good for fans of Comic books and an average entertaining movie for everyone else.",1112745600,3,881,4.290909090909091
2226504,5,B0007P0Y7W,"Elektra is a spinoff of Daredevil, in which she is resurrected from the dead and now lives as an assasin for hire. Within the first 10 minutes, we learn that she is a cold-blooded killer with no remorse and is in it for the money. But after her next mission goes awry when she becomes attached to her targets, Abby and her fathers, things get nasty as members of The Hand themselves go after them.

What really suprised me about Elektra that some superhero films lack is its emotional depth. Elektra not only faces a crisis of conscience, but we see her transformation from a killer to a warrior with a heart, which can be seen with her relationship with Abby. Also, the movie maintains a consistent dark tone throughout, and with it, creates feelings of suspense and intrigue. The action scenes are beautifully shot (the fight with Kirigi used no stunt doubles!), and the cinematography and special effects are definitely achievements worth mentioning in the comic book genre.

Jennifer Garner, however, reminds us why Elektra was made: because she's so darn good in the role. Her dedication to the role is non-stop, and I think she has done an amazing job. The rest of the cast fairs well, especially Kirsten Prout, who has a bright future ahead of her based on this performance.

Elektra is easy for me to recommend as it's the best movie of 2005 so far (with Sin City), and should not be missed for those looking for a worthy action thriller with a good mix of drama and suspense.",1112745600,3,1484,4.613636363636363

2226507,3,B0007P0Y7W,"I know shame on me for liking this movie, well sorta did anyway. It's a mess but an enjoyable one. Garner never mentions Daredevil once, never mentions her dad who was killed by Bullseye either. Hell she's even wearing the chain she left for DareDevil to show him she was alive.  It's only mentioned that...she died once ""which happened in Daredevil"".  Since Elektra is such a tough girl you'd think she'd go right after Bullseye once again. That would've made a better movie instead of the one with the silly plot we get. I mean if you saw the DareDevil director's cut or watched the scene in the credits you'd see that Bullseye never died.

  Anyway after she was killed by Bullseye she was brought back by a blind warriar named Stick (Terrence Stamp). This movie almost basically just acts like Daredevil never happened despite explaning how she is alive. That's a flaw that is hard to look passed. Maybe the movie would've been better if Daredevil was never made. Then again you'd still have those silly bad guys with tattoos that come to life. They even burst to dust when being killed like they're vampires or something. Anyway Elektra becomes an assasin and starts to kill with no feelings what so ever. Then she's assigned to kill a girl and father neighbors who she just got to know and like. She can't do it and then replacements are sent to do it instead "" I know, sounds straight from the Replacement Killers"" and she's forced to protect them.

  Garner is hot as always and is gonna probably be the next Julia Roberts but here she seems lost at times. She was probably thinking about how one episode of Alias even has a better plot than this whole movie. She still is one tough chick and it's fun watching her kick ass. Although it is silly how she moves super quick from one place to whisper in a guys ear and then moves back to where she was so she could throw a knife in his back.  The action still is ok and the movie looks great as well.  The director Rob Bowman who also did the X-Files movie and Reighn of Fire could've possibly made a better Elektra movie if the script was better.",1112659200,2,2102,4.4363636363636365

They seem to have no respect for Miller's character on any level. Take her wardrobe as an example: Miller's Elektra wore a red outfit and so does the movie version. Some negative reviewers have attacked the outfit! I can only assume those reviewers don't give a damn about the comic character. I also suspect that those reviewers don't give a damn about girls. Elektra's red outfit is perfect and is inspired by the comc books. She also looks damn fine in it. Some have complained that the film is too grim. Miller's work is even more grim than the film! I think the film deserves more credit for being one of the darkest PG-13 films I've ever seen. The film suffers from being cut down from a longer R rated version, but that's the only major problem I have with it. That should be fixed when the director's cut is released. Those who find this too dark or grim are ignorant of the comic character and are not fit to judge something they are clueless about.

2226524,3,B0007P0Y7W,"I thought Daredevil was an absolutely pointless film with anonymous direction and an unappealing, non-unapalling lead actor. Thankfully, Elektra has a prettier lead and stronger direction from Rob Bowman, who seems to have ditched the slimy creature effects he seemed so fond of in X-Files and Reign of Fire.

Daredevil is nowhere near as popular in the collective public conscience as Spiderman or even the Hulk. So imagine why Elektra failed at the Box Office. The whole world saw the poster and thought 'Who is she supposed to be?'. Either that or they saw the horrible, highly cliched trailer that totally misrepresented the film.

The resulting critical mauling by just about everyone wasn't completely fair nor was it completely unexpected. The film reeks of deleted scenes and subplots that have been completely cut out. It fades out at the 90-minute mark, leaving us wondering why they even bothered.

However, what we do get is a mild, but nonetheless entertaining action movie with an almost constant spooky atmosphere. The plot is meagre and many of the subs and tangents are never explained or developed. Or they were then got cut out in the editing room (along with Ben Affleck, thankfully)? If they got Frank Miller (he did create the character after all!) to write the script instead of 3 nobodies then it could have been something special.

The DVD is in crisp 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with loud, sometimes dynamic Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. Besides a trailer for the new Family Guy series the extras are of the usual 'whogivesadamn' lot.

Perhaps a future directors cut will improve the film, but as it is Elektra is hardly brilliant, but definitely an above average brainless movie.",1112313600,42,1698,5.00709219858156

I love comic books.  I have loved comic books for almost thirty years.  It pains me to see bad comic book movies because I know these movies contribute to negative public perception of comic books.  Elektra was a bad comic book movie.  I feel bad for Jennifer Garner.  She demonstrated a lot of enthusiasm for the character and was not shy about telling interviewers about how she enjoyed reading the Elektra comics.  But this movie is plain awful.  The story plods along with very little action.  It is just plain boring.  I saw this movie with three fellow comic book fans and we were all bitterly disappointed.",1111881600,5,949,4.719512195121951
2226529,4,B0007P0Y7W,"All I can say from reading the reviews above is that some people do not understand the character of Elektra portrayed in this movie.  Someone above listed that Jennifer Garner cries too much on Alias and in this film.  I'd just like to add that she is very good at portraying emotion on screen and the fact that she cries on Alias a lot and in this movie is to show that she is still human and can still somewhat feel for other people.  Regardless of that, she is a complex character.  At the same time, she is very emotionally disturbed because of the death of her parents. (Evil better hide itself.) I believe that Garner plays this character extremely well.

Another note I read was saying that this movie did not surpass Daredevil.  I would say that it does on many notes.

1.) Ben Affleck did not nail the role of Matthew Murdock and is not a very talented actor.  Rarely have I seen him in a film where he has been ""stunningly impressive"" with his acting ability.  Jennifer Garner is a very talented actress who definately nailed the role of Elektra.

2.) Daredevil lacked more action than this film.  It took over an hour to get started, and was wrapped up in half an hour.  Elektra, on the other hand, started slowly and gradually picked up throughout the movie ending in what I would consider a great confrontation of evil and royal whoopin of it's butt.

3.) The visual effects of Elektra really added to the action and mystical presence of the film.  The battle in the room with the sheets was amazingly well thought out and directed.  Daredevil did not raise the bar on anything.  In fact, I found it very similar to Spiderman considering the close release date of the original Spiderman and Daredevil.

Overall, I would have to say that Elektra was one of my favorite Marvel movies to come out so far.  Jennifer Garner is a very talented actress and should not be ""slammed"" for anything about her performance.  And I am so glad that Ben Affleck was NOT in this movie.",1111276800,10,1980,4.4804469273743015
2226530,5,B0007P0Y7W,"I had heard some reviews after the opening weekend that left me disheartened and thinking that one of my all-time favorite comic book heroines must have been sorely mistreated in a movie I have waited for since before Daredevil even hit the screen (though afterward it actually became a realistic possibility).

I was pleasantly surprised to find that some of the criticisms I heard turned out to be some of the best portions of the movie. And the rest were just false. While I do agree that more action would have been phenomenal...I don't think I could have asked for a better character adaption of Elektra.

There was obviously a lot of thought that went into this and the script. The depiction of Elektra's personality was priceless. The OCD actually made me laugh out loud as I wondered how you could portray Elektra's more neutoric tendencies without making her look completely crazy (Elektra: Assassin, but toned down for the mainstream). And showing her growing increasingly impatient, aggitated, and otherwise put out by her 'downtime' was also perfect and absolutely spot on.

And the relationship with Stick? Couldn't have been portrayed better. As multi-faceted as it's been, they managed to get it all across very well.

Another thing I had to add to this review, and I can't believe I forgot it at first: The Treasure. Let me say that I'm beyond pleased they made sure to include the concept of the Spirit Warriors. Granted, not a lot of background on them, but I'm glad they got some recognition.

I think this movie did a wonderful job staying true to the character and be adaptable to a wider audience. I can see where someone not familiar with the character and her history might be put off (or worse, not quite so drawn in). In the case of anything like this, the more you know, the more you tend to get out of it (or sometimes, the more you tend to dislike it.) But in my case, I'm not someone who will criticize because everything is not exactly as it is in the comic. Nothing ever is. The main point is did they do a good job with what they had? And here, the answer is 'Yes'.

There is room for improvement, namely adding some more action and making the sequences flow a little better. But as a long time fan, I'm happy with how this movie turned out.",1110931200,4,2274,4.574938574938575

Garner as Elektra is basically an assassin who doesn't like what she does. It's not like I wanted her to be a blood thirsty killer, but she looks so pained that it's hard to get into the movie. Of course her character had a traumatic experience in childhood. Goran Visjnic is handsome as the obligatory love interest, but we don't really learn anything about his character. I didn't feel anything towards him or his daughter. It made some sense that Elektra felt a kinship with the daughter because of their obvious similarities. I think that if this movie had went in a different direction it could have been much better. If the movie had been more about Elektra mentoring the daughter I would have been more interested.

2226558,3,B0007P0Y7W,"Ever since 'Spiderman' and 'X-Men' rocketed to success, Marvel Comics has rushed as many of their properties to be developed as feature films as time allows. Unfortunately for Marvel, most superheroes who are cultural icons were created by DC Comics, and so we've been treated to films about relatively obscure comic books like ""Daredevil,"" ""The Punisher,"" and now ""Elektra."" These films seem designed to fail; only comic-book geeks will recognize the names and show up on opening weekend, yet these same comic-book geeks will complain very loudly when the films deviate from the comics.

I don't know how closely ""Elektra"" follows the comic-book and, quite frankly, I could care less. When ""Elektra"" works, it's due to the chemistry between Jennifer Garner as Elektra and Terrance Stamp as her blind mentor. Garner's a talented actress with a real knack for action sequences, but she needs to have a strong cast to play off. Outside of Stamp, absolutely no one provides Garner with what she needs, and so we have one meaningless action sequence after another. The villains are forgetten as soon as the film stops running, and the central conceit of the film - yet another martial arts ""chosen one"" story - is as cliched as they come. The result is a by-the-numbers action flick with occassional above-average characterizations. An average episode of ""Alias"" has better choreographed fight scenes than this movie. ""Alias"" also has far better writing, music, production values, and direction.

If you're a Jennifer Garner or ""Alias"" fan and approach this movie in that light, you probably won't be badly disappointed. Just as in ""Alias,"" Garner gets to confidently strut her stuff wearing fetish outfits and prove her mettle in multiple fight scenes. Although the suits at Marvel might have hoped this would spark a new franchise, ""Elektra"" is really just a side-project for a popular television actress.

as for the plot, despite needing a beefing up as i said before, it really does do pretty well... the good vs evil doesn't come across as too cliched, though it is a bit overstated at times... and the side-plot of elektra's mother's death is interesting, if not a bit strange... still, the journey of her character is well done and fun to watch along the way :)

all in all, i saw this movie in the theatre 3 times, and i plan to buy it on dvd, so i'd certainly say this movie was quite enjoyable :)",1109030400,7,1643,4.336601307189542

If you like comic book movies or girl-fighter movie, you need to get this one.",1525478400,,252,4.382978723404255
