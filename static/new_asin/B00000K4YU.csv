If you like things exploding then it is not for you, but if you like shows with out all the bad verbiage and  something a little different then you might like this one.",1380240000,,329,4.140625

7914280,3,B00000K4YU,"THE DARWIN CONSPIRACY smells of a t.v. pilot, but I'm not sure if it was or not?

Anyway, an iceman frozen for millions of years, is found in Antarctica.  It appears he was far advanced for the time, and NSA honcho Kevin Tighe wants the DNA from this specimen to create his own ""perfect man.""  Enter idealistic Jason Brooks (Killer Buzz, Days of Our Lives, I'm Dangerous Tonight) who has a mentally deficient younger brother, played with a quiet intensity by Robert Floyd.  He is approached to work on reanimating this DNA, but he doesn't know the reason.  Stacy Haiduk (The Beneficiary) is another geneticist who is also employed by Tighe, but she doesn't know his dastardly motives either.

The movie offers us little novelty, although the impassioned monkey who demands his banana and then drives away in a van, is unique and fun.

Certainly not the best of the lot, but not the worst either; it entertains.",1095552000,,910,4.7215189873417724
7914281,3,B00000K4YU,"I am a fan of Jason, what can I say? Have you seen him in 'Days'? He's awesome, and while in this movie he doesn't get to exercise his acting skills too much, I think you will still find it entertaining. The actor who played his brother was a joy to watch...he almost stole the show...I was quite impressed! The plot is imperfect but what plot isn't. Screenplay writers have so many people to answer to. The special effects were completely low-tech but fun. I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, and I wasn't expecting much seeing that this is Sci-fi. I give it 3 stars because with a little more work, it could have been great.",1093478400,,634,4.336134453781512
7914282,1,B00000K4YU,without a doubt one of the dumbest pieces of junk i've ever seen. but almost entertaining because of how bad everything in the movie is. not a bad compilation pseudoscience and theres a delightfully insensitive portrayal of a dna scientist's mentally disabled kid brother in there. terrible terrible terrible. the guy who gave this a good review mustve had some relationship with the son-of-a-producer who had the means and gumption to put together this junk. reminded me of some equally silly 50s B- movies that also had labcoat dudes calling chimps 'monkeys'...,1083024000,,563,5.130434782608695
7914283,4,B00000K4YU,"""The Darwin Conspiracy,"" is a good film which deserves recongnition.  I was expecting a ""B"" grade movie, but was surprised with its fairly good acting, nice plot twists, and decent musical score.  It was good, clean entertainment with a facinating storyline concept (which could have been developed a little more however).  Despite some slight flaws, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and was left wanting more at its conclusion.",970444800,,425,5.220588235294118
