7067276,5,B00UQW29VU,"If youve read my other reviews on Amazon, youll know that I hate spoilers that appear in reviews (especially with a warning.  Thats really important in mysteries. While this film is NOT a mystery (in the crime sense), it is layered in such a way that things are revealed at the directors pace and that made it very enjoyable for me. You will NOT find any spoilers in this review and, if you really want to enjoy this independent French film from 2013 (just released by Cohen Film Group in a beautiful print), I suggest that you be careful in reading reviews with too much detail. As an example, there is an occurrence in the first two minutes of the film that seems totally unrelated to what occurs over the next 60 minutes, but, it is becomes very relevant in the last third of this 95 minute film.

The story is about independence, dependence, family relationships and, yes. Love. Thats all Im going to tell you. I didn't even know that much going in and I was truly drawn in. There is only one bonus on the DVD  the theatrical trailer  and, yes, its okay if you watch that, as it will not give away the plot points.  I was unfamiliar with the cast members but felt they were excellent. And the English subtitles were easy to read nearly all the time.

If you like modern French films, and are willing to take a chance on one that you have never heard of, Im pretty sure youll like this one. I did.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7067277,3,B00UQW29VU,"Going Away is a romantic drama focusing on loner Baptiste (Pierre Rochefort), a gifted substitute elementary school teacher in the south of France. Hes adept at making schoolwork come alive for his students, yet never remains in the same job for more than a semester. Left in charge of Mathias (Mathias Brezot) one weekend by the childs negligent father, Baptiste accompanies the boy to his mother, Sandra (Louise Bourgeon), a fragile woman who works on the beach. An erratic parent eager to make amends, Sandra welcomes Baptiste and her son into her bungalow. For one magical day, they are united into something of a family. But the peaceful idyll doesnt last. Sandra owes money and her creditors are pressuring her. She is once again forced to flee. To help her, Baptiste must return to his own roots and to dark, painful secrets within him.

The film is partly about the attempt to return home, only to discover old wounds and bad blood. Director Nicole Garcia elicits strong performances and creates a moody setting for the characters journey of discovery. Sandras debt seems out of left field  a handy plot point to introduce conflict. The cinematography of the south of France is breathtaking, and is vital in sustaining the films atmosphere.

The only bonus feature on the unrated DVD is a theatrical trailer. The film is in French, with English subtitles.",1466467200,3,1363,4.917391304347826
7067278,5,B00UQW29VU,"Excellent, emotionally charged drama, beautifully photographed with naturalistic tones, and directed, and showcasing some very fine acting work: i found Louise Bourgoin exceptionally beautiful and affecting in her role, and Pierre Rochefort , the son of the director and of great French actor, Jean Rochefort, a very talented and truly handsome young actor, i hope to see more often in films as he makes for the perfect romantic lead. A great surprise was to see iconic star Dominique Sanda finally back to work after quite a long time, i believe, perfectly cast in the key supporting role of the sensitive yet ambiguous wealthy mother of the troubled lead, delivering a great performance and completely engrossing the screen with her presence, and, even though definitely aged, still perfectly luminous, and  clearly a natural. The movie is not as well known as it should be, and, that's too bad. I had to buy the Pal version, since there's no American distribution (a shame) and fortunately i have both systems DVD players. A real delight, from beginning to end, unfolding a bit like a mystery, but it is an insightful psychological drama, that argues family's values,and recent European society as well, it turns out to be haunting and extremely sweet, shot also on gorgeous different locations in the South of France (mostly). Highly recommended, and, hopefully, one fine day, available also in the States, who knows?",1441584000,8,1421,5.098712446351931

7067281,4,B00UQW29VU,"Gah!  Nobody does put upon, displeased, disaffected, exasperated, and unnerved in dozens of different shades and ranges like the French.  I find it bemusing in moderate doses, but it gets tedious and wearing when it expands throughout the entire run time.

Traveling schoolteacher Baptiste, the prodigal son, returns to his family on the holiday weekend of Pentecost Sunday.  Good themes explored about the nature of loyalty and the narrative unfolds in surprising turns.  The premise that he would show such a level of commitment or generosity (it's left open-ended as to which end of the spectrum) to basically a stranger in Sandra and her son, Mathias, I don't know how plausible that is to me.  Yet, I did stay engaged to the story and enjoyed how it unfolded.",1488672000,2,764,4.9296875

Then there were many other things that happened in the story that were very interesting and awe-inspiring. The story just kept moving right along from one incident to the next.

7067342,3,B00UQW29VU,"Guy travels around France being a substitute teacher. One day a kid in his class doesn't get picked up after school for a long weekend. He drives the kid to its dad's. One thing leads to another and the teacher takes the kid for the weekend but winds up at the kid's mother's house who works as a temp waitress on the beach at a beach resort.

What did I personally get out of this? France's famous beaches are just like ours--tourists show up and so do the temp workers with good weather. Not so glamorous but nothing really is. Also there has been this push in American society for people with mental and emotional disorders to be treated just like every one else. Sounds good on paper. But then in reality it is just a disaster. These two people just drift around because they have similar issues. Sad. But says a lot about their behavior and the results on people around them. And just think ... not everyone knows the medical reasons behind their behavior. They just have to move on thinking about and wondering about what a horrible encounter they had. Reminds me of an a girl I went to school with. She was a terror. Found out after I graduated she was seeing a psychiatrist all those years as she had very bad mental/emotional issues. Not a good situation to put another sane kid in . . . to be around such people. Seems tilted to the sick person's favor. Anyway the actress in this movie shows promise. She was in the Brosnan comedy movie a year or two ago as the spoiled air head bride.

Yeah so he is supposed to be reserved, but he did not convey the beliveability of the rest of the cast. He was just flat, but overall I like the film.",1472342400,2,458,4.464285714285714
7067347,4,B00UQW29VU,"Baptiste, an intelligent compassionate (it doesn't hurt that he's exceedingly good looking) substitute teacher makes certain that he doesn't stay too long in any job or place.  We don't know why. He intervenes, minimally to start, in the life of his young student Mathias, who's father has forgotten him at school. Baptiste develops more than an affinity for Sandra, Mathias's mom, who is aggressively pursued by loan sharks. To tell more detail would spoil. A key theme: Who is the arbiter of success? By what criterion do we measure it--  money, social status, the highest levels of academic achievement, integrity, compassion, loving relationships, forging a good enough life while managing difficult impairments?  And surely I'm not the first to notice that this itinerant teacher bears the name of another itinerant, in that case, preacher, suggesting that this modern Baptiste has some wisdom to impart. The directing by Nicole Garcia is solid, as is the acting by Pierre Rochefort, Louise Bourgoin, and Mathias Brezot.  Good job all around.

7067348,4,B00UQW29VU,"The movie showed one of the main reasons for not getting involved with people who ""want to have fun"" proceeding to promote poisoning with the brain and liver lethal toxic chemical All Co Hell which the male lead absurdly consumed and promptly demonstrated severe All Co Hell allergies.  Contrary to felony religionist preachings that money is the root of all evil (unless their criminal gangs possess it which in fact is the one clear demonstration of the point) and related fraud and thief efforts to ""steal candy from a baby"" and anyone else who has anything of value (whether financial or beauty), it is known NOT to burn any holes in pockets that have any (all of which are burned by external frauds and thieves not by the money itself).  There is no sense in which having money in his own pocket or within arm's reach would interfere with the male lead's teaching or anything else he might want to be doing with his life.  The male lead's refusal to accept the positives that the universe provided for him, except when needed by the female lead, showed probable cause for the earlier ""commitment"".  However, as a case study in silliness and questionable motivations, the story was well written, mostly well photographed but for a few unduly dark segments, and well produced.
