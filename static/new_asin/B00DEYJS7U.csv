Juan Diego is , as usual, fabulous",1399939200,3,118,4.363636363636363
5795558,2,B00DEYJS7U,"The booklet tells us how pressured for time was Rossini when writing this opera; how he resorted to borrowing from his other works and perhaps even persuaded Pacini to compose some of the music.  To me, this situation comes through very clearly.  There is so much music which sounds familiar or perfunctory and which one can finish singing even without seeing the score.  Very little of it is fresh and new.  I was also interested to notice that the performance runs for 215 minutes of music, in comparison to 222 minutes for both Lohengrin and Semiramide.  Insufficient inspiration does not justify such length.  In addition, there are miles and miles of recitative.
The superb cast spares no effort to make something of this effortful work.  If these people can't make Matilde work, no one can.  The sets and costumes are wonderful.",1396396800,2,834,4.865248226950355
5795559,5,B00DEYJS7U,"Great Performances by all!!!  Florez shines as the villain and his conversion is very humorous.  And the rest of the cast are truly exceptional!!!!  The minimalist set works here, even though I like more elaborate sets as a rule.",1393372800,2,229,4.82051282051282
5795560,5,B00DEYJS7U,"This is a performance for the ages.  The utter virtuosity of Florez in this florid music is expected, but everyone in the cast is equally fine.  The two Russian women (soprano and mezzo) are a revelation.  You can't help joining in the ovation at the end.  Amazingly delightful.",1386288000,11,278,4.729166666666667
5795561,5,B00DEYJS7U,"Juan Diego Florez is my favorite tenor.  Did not know the soprano, but she is fabulous as well.
Too bad Amazon sent me the opera with two identical discs # 2 in it, instead of disc 1 and 2.
After returning it, Amazon promptly sent me another copy with the same problem: 2 discs of Act 2
instead of one disc of Act 1 and one of Act 2.  Even Amazon gave up, because they sent me a refund.
I had to order this opera through a different vendor.  It has arrived in the meantime with the correct
disc 1 and disc 2.  It's a lovely opera, great singing, great acting!",1384819200,7,559,4.009009009009009
5795562,4,B00DEYJS7U,"I bought this opera because of the singers and they didn't disappoint. It was a real pleasure to listen to them all and not a weak link. Of course, Florez was in his milieu and let out all the stops, as usual and he had fantastic music to do so. However, his acting, especially when he tried to be a meanie, left a bit to be desired. It's probably not in his nature just like I could not imagine Pavarotti to ever having acted ""mean"". (Fortunately for posteriority, Pavarotti's ""Otello"" exists on CD only.)
Unfortunately, Rossini seems to have lavished truly great music on a very dumb libretto. Given the opera's length, it can be trying. Although the plot of ""Il babiere di Siviglia"" is just as predictable, its wit is sorely missing in ""Matilde"". Not Rossini's fault - but there it is. Otherwise the traditional production was exactly the way I like it.
I also always appreciate Italian subtitles although I must admit I had a bit of a hard time dealing with the Neapolitan dialect. But that is my fault, not the opera's.",1383091200,9,1024,4.54054054054054
5795563,5,B00DEYJS7U,"Yes, the story is ridiculous. From that point of view (only), Rossini's Matilde di Shabran deserved its years of near total obscurity. But what wonderful music! In the hands of real artists, the opera comes alive and transcends its story line to reveal truths that could never be discovered simply by reading the text.

Matilde is anot alone in this. How many opera librettos are transformed by the music of Gluck, Handel, Mozart, Verdi and even Wagner from melodrama to music drama?

Don't pass up the opportunity to experience this Rossini rarity sung, directed and produced by consummate Rossinians. Such a transcendent experience will not come again soon.",1381881600,8,659,5.092592592592593
5795564,5,B00DEYJS7U,"One of my most favorite operas and having seen several version going back to the very early quite bizarre Pesaro production with a young Florez - this one is a delight to watch.  There are no poor performers in the cast - both in voice and acting.  The staging is the recycled double helix stairs set from several prior Pesaro productions but this version moves with more confidence and slickness.  Florez is in commanding style and being that much older - more believable in his role, but the Neapolitan poet role of Isidoro is very well handled as is Matilde and Edgardo.
People say the story is odd - but not really. It's essentially a reverse Taming of the Shrew but also a parody of characters with exaggerated personality aspects.  The 3 CD Decca recording of 2006 if superior musically as some of the music on this DVD is a wee bit muted and less energetic, possibly a result of the live recording pick-up.
There are English subtitles but speaking Italian I enjoyed watching with the original words and trying to pick up the Neapolitan dialect pieces - very enjoyable.
Florez was recently selected as one of the top 10 tenors of all time (sound recorded history I assume!) - this is a must see as he is his usual fantastic self with a voice that is just a gift so rare.",1378252800,20,1276,4.487068965517241
5795565,5,B00DEYJS7U,"After three Rossini Opera Festival releases were marred by questionable staging, it is a huge delight to have one of Rossini's last Neapolitan opera seria available in an exciting, more traditional staging. And sung to near perfection, as well! In fact, not one member of this cast did less than a five star job on some extremely demanding music.

Osborne (""The Bel Canto Operas"")refers to the plot as ""senseless and complicated"", which it is, truth to tell. But the music, gentle reader is sublime, in the main, but demands a first rate cast to realize the beauty and complexities of the score.

Juan Diego Florez is a favorite at our home; whether on CD or (preferably) DVD, JFD has the range, skills and intelligence to bring life to roles that have been abandoned for decades, in part, because there was no one who could handle the tessatura and coloratura demands they present. Tenors who sing Verdi, Puccini and the later great Italian composers simply cannot navigate in this vocal stratosphere. Listen to Gedda's or Pavarotti's valiant efforts in William Tell or I Puritani. Here, JDF's entrance is marked by some of the most demanding music Rossini ever wrote, and it is executed flawlessly, as is the balance of the role. He is performing in William Tell at the 2013 ROF this month (August) and a release of a DVD of Tell is promised ""soon"" (whatever that means). (One might also wish for a DVD of May's ROH La Donna Del Lago, as well!)

I had not previously heard Olga Peretyatko, but she matched JDF for vocal beauty and agility, as well as an intelligent portrayal of Matilde. The finale of the second act, beginning with ""Ebben - Son tua, son tua per sempre"" is about 17 minutes of non stop, free wheeling coloratura singing, with Mme Peretyatko ranging  from deep chest tone to stratospheric highs. She is a stunning performer.

I had also no experience with Anna Goryachova, who sings the en travesti role of Eduardo, long held captive by Corradino. Hers is the only role permitted 2 arias and she executes both perfectly. From bottom to top and all places in between, with all the runs and other coloratura demands fully realized, she's superb!

Paolo Bordogna sings the poet Isidoro very well. He has a noticible but not intrusive vibrato, but great stage presence to realize the buffoon character he sings. (For those who lack experience with the concept of the ""semiseria"" opera, it demands one character to sing in the Neapolitan which has enough variatio from ""mainstream"" Italian to be noticable.) Very enjoyable performance overall.

The remainder of the cast maintain a very high musical and dramatic level throughout, including the chorus. Matilde reflects a maturing of Rossini's compositional skills. There are only three solo arias but a lot of rich and frequently complex ensemble pieces fill out the score, so the ability of chorus and soloists to interact effectively is critical, and fortunately, all do.

The opera has an interesting performance history, starting from the premier, where Paganini had to fill in for both the conductor, first violinist and horn player, substituting a viola solo for the French horn one originally written. The performance here is based on the ""new critical edition"" of the score, wherein a lot of scholarship was needed to get to what Rossini wrote.

Disc quality is stunning, both visually and sonically. Prior ROF DVDs have been  criticized for the poor microphone placement in what is a sports arena in times other than August when the ROF occurs. There is no sign of that here. The DTS surround mode really brings the performance to life.

This is a long opera, running 220 minutes, with no extra features. Subtitles are in European languages only.

It is a splendid performance, gentle reader. I got mine from Europe, where DVDs are relesed earlier than in the US and, frequently for less $$.

As they say, ""Run, do not walk ...""",1375920000,23,3901,4.856927710843373

8592704,5,B00DEYJS7U,"My comment is directed at those who know only enough to put the disc in the machine and watch as one would the latest Sondheim musical. While over the considerable number  of years that I have been around I have seen some of the best and heard many others, I remain simply a watcher-listener to opera as I am to British and American mysteries and ballet.
This is a good one, who cares about the plot? The singing is gratification for the ears as the stage produces sufficient action to maintain one's interest. I admit that I rarely listen to a full opera....or any other lengthy feature......at one sitting......more than four score and seven years have weakened my ability to do so..............so listening time is irrelevant. I have almost given up entirely.........except those with a few artists in productions that were never recorded otherwise.....and am satisfied with those found on this one.
So...to other amateurs, I can with clear conscience commend this one as a happy choice.",1508371200,,990,4.92814371257485
8592705,2,B00DEYJS7U,"I received two copies of disc 2. If anyone out there received two copies of disc 1, let's trade. I had to give it at least two stars because, well, it is Juan Diego Florez. When I get the complete opera we'll see if it gets more stars and more of a description.",1480723200,,261,3.943396226415094
8592706,5,B00DEYJS7U,"Magnificent singing. JDF is stunning. The rest of the cast are absolutely top-notch. But let's not forget the orchestra and the conductor. Besides,there's some beautiful horn-playing which absolutely matches the virtuosity of the singers and who should be credited. Who is this great artist?",1466812800,,291,5.636363636363637
8592707,5,B00DEYJS7U,"This is an excellent production, with a superb cast.  I found the lead soprano's timbre slightly veiled - she has an edge to her voice and it never seems to open up completely.  It didn't sound ""effortless"".  Annick Massis is FAR better on the CD recording - she almost sounds like Sutherland.  The mezzo-soprano playing the male role is far better.  All of the men are above average and Florez is remarkable.  He really has it all - good looks, charm, and an extremely unique and flexible voice.  His high notes ring out with ease and strength.",1460419200,,545,4.556701030927835
8592708,5,B00DEYJS7U,"Absurd libretto, but who cares?  This is not even semi-serious opera, it is opera buffa!  What matters is the performance, and the singers involved.  Juan Diego is awesome beyond plus and so are the two Russian sopranos.  I am always amazed at the amount of silly plots wrapped in glorious music (Sonnambula, Puritani come to mind).  I am quite glad I got it!",1426550400,2,359,4.634920634920635
8592709,5,B00DEYJS7U,"This is an excellent recording of a lesser known masterpiece by Rossini.  The plot, a mixture of the serious and the comic, is ridiculous even by the standards of 19th century opera (including Il Trovatore).  But what glorious music and what glorious performances!  Rossini here is at the top of his game;  for me, Matilde is in the same league with The Barber of Seville and La Cenerentola.  All the singers in this performance are in fine voice, especially Florez and Peretyatko, both of whom are dazzling.  The ensemble pieces at the middle of each of the two acts represent spectacular music making and offer opportunities for spectacular listening.  Highly recommended both to fans of Rossini and to lovers of great opera.",1408924800,3,727,4.909836065573771
8592710,5,B00DEYJS7U,"With these performances at Pesaro Juan Diego Florez establishes himself beyond a shadow of a doubt as one of the great tenors of all times. He is not Caruso, Bjoerling, Tucker, Corelli or any of the other immortals. But I know of no tenor today or ever who gives the kind of performance Florez does here. It is vocal and dramatic virtuosity that belongs on the same plane as that of the immortals. The opera itself too is in a class by itself as a biting yet hilarious satire on male misogyny. It is Rossini at his peak as a commentator on the foibles of us mortals.",1407974400,2,566,4.299065420560748
8592711,4,B00DEYJS7U,"The singing of the principals was, as expected, quite good (especially FJD).  However, the picture quality was less than satisfactory.  The photographs that accompanied the album were bright; the colors vivid.  On the DVD, on the other hand, everything was rather dark.  Singers who were on that staircase (?), were hardly visible.",1406160000,3,331,5.3076923076923075
