8010185,5,B0001CLYXE,"A ripper of an Italian exploitation movie from Lamberto Bava, who lurks under the pseudonym John Old Jr., an in-joke referencing his dad Mario Bava who used the name 'John Old' on a couple of films. This action potboiler is a rip-off of 'First Blood' and 'Ruckus' with a refreshing ecological perspective, considering the Italian track-record of animal treatment in the cannibal and mondo movie cycles.

Big city cop Tiger Sharp (great name!) retires to his home town where he grew up after doing time for blowing away a scumbag who killed his wife and his partner. He also brings with him some supercharged assault rifle which can shoot all sorts of bullets, grenades etc. It's not too long before he tangles with the local rednecks, led by childhood pal and D'Amato regular George Eastman. Sharp and Eastman used to hunt together when young, but Eastman's brother and minions shoot the wildlife to deliver to the local Asian who wants them alive for 'medicinal' purposes.

Sharp is enraged by this practice and assaults the 'chink' and berates Eastman, as well as throwing a few hicks through store windows. Then his estranged daughter shows up and it's not too long before she is raped and killed by Eastman's thugs. After a bit of a drag in the middle, Sharp finally gets out the super assault rifle and the final fifteen minutes or so see an army of hayseeds and shitkickers blown away and a final showdown with Eastman. There's a pulsing electronic score, a dodgy hippy-ish theme song and a reprise of the 'First Blood' scene where Stallone is hanging off a cliff being shot at from a helicopter.

My copy I bought from the new-ish Denmark DVD label Another World Entertainment (AWE DVD) who have released a lot of great trash and cult movies. It's in a nice widescreen 1.85:1 print and in English with optional foreign subtitles. Also includes a few trailers.",1424217600,,1866,4.7708978328173375
8010186,5,B0001CLYXE,"My pickup's full of dead rednecks
I guess you can say that's a good start
Even though that will lead to a drop in folks
Hangin' `round this old bar
All I wanted was some peace and quiet
In my hunting cabin in the woods
But the good ol' boys kept a-hasslin' me and look what I had to do

Chorus:
Linin' up rednecks!
Shootin' `em down!
It's so easy!
With my gun and a half!
Linin' up rednecks!
Shootin' `em down!
It's so easy!
With my gun and a half!

I didn't start the killin'
They did!
They killed my pet deer, my daughter's fianc&eacute;e and my pal
When they came from my daughter
I killed `em all and fled to the woods

Chorus

My former best buddy tried to cut a deal
But his brother shot my daughter dead
Got my gun from under my front porch
Gonna' fill `em full of lead!

Chorus

Redneck death screams are the best!
If I have any trouble with it
I just tell myself it is one less right-wing voter
Or Klan member on the Earth

Chorus

Now I'm off with my former best-buddy
To the sheriff's office
Got some splain'n to do
My `gun and a half' is wrapped around a tree
I think I'm in the poo!

Chorus

WITH MY GUN AND A HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALF!",1282953600,6,1147,4.057777777777778
