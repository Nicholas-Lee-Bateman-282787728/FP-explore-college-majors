479015,4,6302559251,"...The only complaint I have of the movie is that the sound editor needs to be shot, because in many places where the actors are speaking quietly (and even above-whispering voices), you can just barely hear them!  At times like that, I'm glad to have closed captioning capabilities on my TV.  But other than that, a wonderful movie.  One of the few movies over 3 hours long I will sit and watch from beginning to end.",1024012800,,417,4.4605263157894735

I ordered it in 2015 but just got around to trying to watch it recently; that's when I discovered the problem.  How do I exchange it for a DVD made to be played on equipment manufactured for use in the USA?,1500854400,,351,3.9857142857142858

The original was two parts. This one is only one. Quality of sound a bit distorted also.  Otherwise an excellent movie. Much more historical correct that others I have seen.",1258243200,,332,4.610169491525424

7827401,5,6302559251,"Just wondering why this Mini-series is not available in USA. Maybe due to licensing(foreign) issues of the production. This mini-series has an all star cast and is seemingly accurately based on Columbus's journal notes. In my opinion it would sell! I vividly remember it and Do have a copy on Beta of the oringinal 1986 broadcast and on VHS from the History channel Re-broadcast years later which did have commentary by Sander Van Oker,probably from 1992(QuintiCentennial Celebration). Just obtained the Dutch DVD,which is ok on my all region DVD player,but,I seem to detect that Byrne's#Columbus) voice is dubbed in by a no-name actor...Oh well.more licensing and conflicts I imagine.",1249084800,,685,5.293577981651376

Dear Sirs:

I am writing this letter to urge you to release the 1985 mini-series Christopher Columbus starring Gabriel Byrne on DVD. Although this excellent mini-series was nominated for two Emmys (Outstanding Art Direction for a Limited Series or Special and Outstanding Costume Design for a Limited Series or Special), it has never been released on DVD for the North American market. Its only video release has been a heavily-edited two hour VHS version from Warner Home Video in 1992 and 1998. This release doesn't do the film justice when its full length is almost six hours.
When you do decide to release this mini-series on DVD, please restore and re-master the original, un-cut, un-edited version that aired on the CBS television network. I'd really appreciate it if you could include the original CBS promotional trailers as well.

Many thanks,

Your name and

Also vote for a release of this mini-series on DVD by registering with tvshowsondvd.com. The more letters that are sent and the more votes that are cast, the sooner we will see this mini-series restored and re-mastered on DVD.
If it worked for ""North and South"", it can work for this mini-series as well.",1151020800,5,1593,5.1

7827404,2,6302559251,This movie is good but leaves much to be desired. The original movie had to be close to 5 hours long this one is only2 hours and 15 minutes. The original was played on TV in the late '80's and was a great 5 Star movie. This one is the cut version and leaves out alot of the story.,1090195200,5,280,3.76271186440678
