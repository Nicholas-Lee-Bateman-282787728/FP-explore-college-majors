3093963,5,B0012QCZ54,It is way better than the first one.  much better dancing.  Why would anyone rate this a three,1210464000,7,94,4.166666666666667
3093964,3,B0012QCZ54,"...and dance they do! And they do it very, very well.

4.5 stars for the jaw dropping moves these kids are able to do but a mere 2 stars for everything else, so let's round that to 3 stars shall we.

Though it's been said over and over again about other movies of this ilk, there has to be more to a movie than the dancing and as far as Step Up 2 the Streets goes, the other stuff just doesn't really cut it.

The film chronicles - did I say chronicles? - sorry, no, this movie doesn't chronicle anything, it's about a young street dancer named Andie (Briana Evigan). She's beautiful, out of this world talented and certainly doesn't want to be shipped off to Texas which is where she's headed if she doesn't stop getting into trouble.

Andie gets accepted into the elite Maryland School of the Arts (MSA) where she attempts to widen her dancing scope to more classical styles. Her street dancing crew the 4-1-0 - all but one of whom does not know Andie is now enrolled in the school - become sick and tired of the excuses she gives as to why she isn't able to attend practice with them and they eventually kick her out of the crew.

This is where I find the character flaws in the movie to be really apparent...these kids are obviously in their late teens and 20s, however they spend all day dancing in the streets, Have they no jobs?? No responsibilities?? How do they pay for the cost of living? Don't they even take a break to make some deals or turn some tricks?? It's not just that they are sooo devoted to dancing and preparing for a dance battle called ""The Streets"", the writers make it seem like they genuinely solely exist to practice their dancing 24-7. No one has to go home because their baby-mama is always nagging, no one has goals or dreams, their only purpose in the film is to dance...and still with all that practice they still don't have what it takes.

Fortunately, all these annoyances are seasoned with superbly choreographed and exceptionally performed dance numbers that make the knot in my forehead relax until the plot gets back underway.

Andie decides to put together her own crew made up of static, clich outcast kids that go to MSA. There's the Asian girl who thinks she's ""down"" but you can't understand a word she says, the tall-loner girl no one hangs out with, a guy who's supposed to be the nerdy guy, but this isn't really developed, a few others not worth mentioning and the other main character, Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman).

When we first hear of Chase, we are immediately led to believe that he is MSA royalty but living in the shadow of his older, more talented MSA faculty brother and also that his dancing skills have given him a sense of entitlement making him something of a playa with the ladies. This would be all well and good, for Chase would be a well-developed character and even have opportunities for growth as he tries to redeem himself from his philandering ways and woo our heroine Andie. However, as soon as we get to know Chase, he's not like this at all, in fact none of the earlier descriptions of him are mentioned again or developed at all - he's just a regular boring guy with nothing extraordinarily good or bad about him. But, like everyone else in the film, he's great looking...and man, can he dance!

Alright, so the ""plot"" eventually brings us to the ultimate street battle called, no less, ""The Streets"" between the new crew and the old crew in a rain-soaked climax I won't ruin it for you (really, if you have to ask who wins you just don't get how formulaic this film is). This dance-off is well worth the wait as the choreography is spot-on. The scene could not have been shot with more skill, you can see how fluid the dancing is, nothing is chopped up which leaves the viewer in awe at how many laws of physics are shattered by the moves these kids are able to do!

Another thing worth mentioning is the supposed-nerdy kid named Moose (newcomer Adam G. Sevani) who befriends Andie at MSA, he's a kid who we see is stuck in the wrong major once we see his entertaining freestyle moves. He makes the most of the character given him and probably saves the story that falls flat in between dance numbers. Maybe, just maybe, one day he'll be the Jason Biggs of a new generation.

In summary, don't get me wrong, when I left the theater I was smiling and wishing I had those mad skills. You just have to know what to expect before you see the movie or you may wind up being too disappointed to really appreciate how superb the dancing is. Thus, if dancing is your thing, do lower your expectations as regards plot and characterization and do cop this disc and you too will be wowed and blown away by the dancing as these kids Step up 2 The Streets.",1209945600,4,4722,4.422324510932106
3093965,3,B0012QCZ54,"Yes, this movie is cheesy and totally lacks a plot line, but the dancing is amazing.  I was especially blown away by Moose.  I never expected that nerdy character to bust out ""Michael Jackson-style"" on the stairs.  Dancing in the rain is also totally unbelievable, but it doesn't make the choreography and soundtrack any less entertaining!",1209340800,,339,5.017857142857143
3093966,5,B0012QCZ54,"I thought this movie was really good, but that is probabaly because I love to watch street dancing. If you didn't like the first one you probably won't like this one.",1208736000,,166,4.387096774193548
3093967,1,B0012QCZ54,"I'm not the only person who saw the cultural insensitivity of this movie! I think it's in ""fluff pieces"" where stereotypes are particularly dangerous: The story claimed that it wanted to showcase how dance and hip-hop transcend cultural and class divisions, but it only served to highlight and exploit these barriers. I hold the writers more responsible for this missed opportunity than the director, though. A few simple plot changes could have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves.  It's easy to believe that observations like this will fall on deaf ears, but I hope that people (in audiences and in the movie industry) will be more considerate before they decide to patronize such ignorance.",1208563200,5,742,5.132231404958677
3093968,5,B0012QCZ54,I have seing this movie like 3 time in theater is so good if you have loved the first one but think that it need more dance in it you have to see the second. In the first movie you have more story and less of dance and in the second movie you have less story and more dance so go see it!!!!!,1208304000,,291,3.634920634920635
3093969,5,B0012QCZ54,"The fellow below me is, in all aspects, correct. If what you look for in a dance movie is to be highly distracted by a shabby plot. Me, I loved Step Up 2 for this very reason...

Most dance movies aim too high: they want killer dance scenes -with- an excellent plot. What do most wind up with? Trite, familiar plots they still try to execute even though we've seen them before (so we know well enough to follow along) while still delivering a sliver or two of dance sequences... but nowhere near the amount the usual viewer wants to see.

Now, Step Up 2 says a big ""yeah right"" to that entire idea.

There is next to NO plot. Yeah, it's there, barely. Enough to pretend that it's not one long music video. But, it really IS like one long music video--and that's wicked awesome. The dance scenes are long and intricate, the music is great, and it delivers on everything I want to see in a dance movie: less talking and more dancing.

So if you're into these sorts of movies for the chick flick value, it might be a skip or a rent. But if you're into it for, well, the dancing--I give it 5 stars.",1205452800,41,1094,4.220095693779904

DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT.  THE POINT IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO ""GET IT"".  JUST WATCH AND APRECIATE THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY.
DANCE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL THE ARTS BECAUSE IT IS ART ITSELF.  THE WHOLE SERIES OF ""STEP UP"" IS A GOOD EXPERIENCE.  YOU MAY WANT TO CHECK OUT STEP UP 3 WHICH IS THE BEST OF THE SERIES!",1425254400,,416,4.15

3094408,1,B0012QCZ54,"So--as many people have said, the dancing in this movie is great. I mean, it's beyond great. It's phenomenal. But the plot? Oh wait, there isn't one. And there is NO WAY that lead actress came from the streets (even her eyebrows were manicured). Her co-star came off as a cheating jerk of a boyfriend, as opposed to a romantic, and both looked way too old to be in high school. This movie lived and breathed in cliches, from the ""transformed underdog from the streets"" (who is, as always, played by a white lead) to the dorky loner with a secret talent for dance. This movie is not worth watching. Skip it and watch the dance sequences online.",1424044800,,643,4.4576271186440675

Getting just one of these routines right would take longer that the whole time period of the movie.  Still,that's part of the entertainment and I love the dancing.",1361145600,,451,4.973333333333334

The first one wasn't that good and neither was the dancing, but I still wanted to see the sequel. I'm glad I did. It makes the first look even worse. Everything is 10x better. The characters, the music and the dancing. The plot isn't something you have not seen before, but that's okay. The film is pretty much about the dancing more than anything else and that is okay. The two leads are charming and have chemistry. Moose is also charming. He has become a fan favorite. To me he made part 3 decent. The ending is one of best endings ever. None of the other SU films can top it. ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" is a fun and entertaining film. I believe all ages will enjoy it. It would've been nice to see an interracial couple as the main couple in one of these films considering the subject matter.",1343692800,,899,4.202312138728324

3094823,4,B0012QCZ54,"""Step Up 2: The Streets"" is a sequel to ""Step Up"".  This movie features different characters, but continues similar themes of urban teens navigating relationships and expressing themselves through hip-hop style dance.

I wonder if anyone watched ""Breakin"" 1, 2, ""Krush Groove"" or ""Beat Street"" in research. Know your history.. (on a side note, it would have been interesting to get Adolpho Quinones and Michael Chambers to play some bit parts.)

The film is surprisingly effective. It's clearly a formula film, broadly in the underdog-youth-team-of-misfits genre. Whatever the various plot holes, it is very professionally shot and put together. Excellent choreography and cinematography.  There is also plenty of hip-hop dance music by contemporary artists of the genre (a bonus CD soundtrack would have been nice for the DVD release.)

That the main point-of-view characters/romantic leads were Caucasian was somewhat to be expected for a major studio film. To the filmmakers credit, they did feature a multi-cultural cast, though only a few of the characters are given personalities.
It's unclear how much of her own dancing that Briana Evigan did, but she's sympathetic and compelling as the tough-but-sensitive Andie.

Some quibbles: Several of the characters here don't rise above stereotypes, (the talented dork Moose, the bullying rival crew leader Tuck.) It's curious that the director, John Chu, is Asian-American, and the one prominent Asian character is a foreign exchange student with a choppy accent who speaks in clipped catchphrases. And does anyone from the 'hood dance crews go to school at all? (To that point, I suppose it was nearly unavoidable, but many of the actors/dancers featured here skew too old to pass as current high school students. Though I'm sure this is neither here nor there with the target audience for the film.)

The main reason I love this movie is the dance sequences are amazing especially the one on the train and the final part of the movie.

3094843,3,B0012QCZ54,"All of the dancing movies I've seen so far have been weak in everything but the dancing, and this one is no exception, especially when it comes to the plot and character development.  That might not be a problem for immature teenagers, but anyone beyond that level will strain to suspend their disbelief in the face of the steady stream of flaws this movie presents.  On this basis, this movie is lucky to get 2 stars.

On the other hand, I watched this movie primarily because I love dancing, and the dancing in this movie was pretty good - not amazing, but still pretty good.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the dancing doesn't really show up until the final showdown scenes of the movie, and in fact perhaps the best dancing is to be found while the final credits are rolling, as well as in the bonus materials.  Particularly egregious in this regard is putting the JabbaWockeeZ performance in the bonus materials and only showing a small sample in the movie itself.  The director, John Chu, makes the excuse there wasn't time to include this material in the movie, but I don't buy it.  Given that this is a *dance* movie, all of the best dancing should have been included in the movie, and the resulting omission of non-dancing nonsense would have improved the movie, not worsened it.

Nevertheless, I can still give the dancing 4 stars, so 3 stars for the movie overall.  Considering that lukewarm rating, I wouldn't say that I wasted my time watching this movie, but I can't really recommend it either, unless you're able to overlook its weaknesses.",1282348800,,1551,4.672794117647059

3094848,2,B0012QCZ54,"Saddled with a screenplay that wouldn't earn a passing grade in a Cinema 101 course, ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" is an urban fairy tale about an orphaned crew dancer (Briana Evigan) from the 'hood who is accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts.  But can she find a home with the assortment of geeks, preppies and classically-trained arty types who attend the school?  And can she succeed as a student without turning her back on her ""homies"" from the old neighborhood?  Or will she be forced to form her own crew from dancers at the school to compete with the Big Boys out on the streets?

You can write the script yourself, but the key selling-point of this sequel to ""Step Up"" - sort of a mash-up of ""Fame,"" ""Footloose"" and ""School of Rock"" - is clearly not the storytelling but the dancing.  And in that respect it delivers the goods.  So ignore the predictable plotting, the tinny dialogue, the corny inspirational speeches, the wafer-thin characters, the obligatory montage sequences and the amateurish acting, and simply revel in the moves, street-dance or otherwise, that permeate the film.  It's not much in the way of compensation, I know, but at least it's better than nothing.",1259193600,6,1189,4.742718446601942
3094849,4,B0012QCZ54,"Okay, so these new wave dance flicks are a dime a dozen, and half of them are just mediocre offerings with one impossible dance move after the next.  When `Step Up' came out I really expected nothing from it, but I got a sensational and really, really great movie that had enough heart and chemistry to make it stand out amongst the onslaught of trashy teen dance movies.  Really, you need to see it!  So, I was excited about the prospects of `Step Up 2: The Streets', but after seeing the trailer I was afraid it was going to be nothing more than a rehash of the same story with different actors.

So I waited.

I am happy (so happy) to say that `Step Up 2: The Streets' does not have the same story, even though it is slightly similar.  It does lack the chemistry that made the original so charming, but the lead actress, Briana Evigan, carries enough saucy charm to make up for Robert Hoffman's lack of everything (the guy is kind of gross creepy here).

Andie is a teen with no real purpose.  Her mother dies when she was young and she's been living with her mother's best friend.  She finds herself at a crossroads when her ties with the infamous 410 (a dance crew) leave her with two options; a prestigious dance school or Texas.  Now, I live in Texas, so I understand why she opted for the school.  She doesn't fit in (of course) but she finds herself flirting with even more danger when the school legend Chase Collins takes a liking to Andie, and her dance style, and convinces her to join forces with him, and a slew of talented yet overlooked students, in order to take on a street dancing competition.  Love develops, feelings are trampled, rivalries are started...and dancing HAPPENS!

Like I said, Evigan is great.  She is sensual with a kick of edge that keeps her interesting; and that smoker's voice is just, UGH, so Scarlett Johansson...me loves it!  Robert Hoffman is the opposite.  He is supposed to be all charming and sweet and lovable but he comes across creepy.  The rest of the cast is really just a collection of moving bodies, and they all work well in that respect.  Miss Ventura is stunning to look at whether she's moving or standing still, I'll give her that.  Black Thomas (yes, that is his name) is respectable as the token gangster (very clich, but whatever) and Danielle Polanco is quite engaging as the street-smart and genuinely sweet Missy.

But this is not about acting, believe me.

The dancing is insane here, and the final dance scene, in the rain, is just UGH, WOW...that was hot!  Yes, I said hot, and I meant that in like every possible way.  I did want to mention Adam G. Sevani (who looks like `Year One' version Michael Cera) who is your typical `nerdy kid who befriends outcast' here.  The reason I mention him is because his Michael Jackson inspired dace sequence at the end is phenomenal and easily the most memorable part of the entire movie.

So, if you want a fun and entertaining film with lots of dancing then this is the one for you.  It doesn't have the `everything' factor that the original had, but it makes up for it in other areas.

See them both.",1255305600,11,3109,4.476021314387212

3094864,1,B0012QCZ54,"This movie did not present ANYTHING new. It is as cliche'd as a film could get. The only thing different was that this time the poor chick was a white girl instead of a black or hispanic. I guess that was thrown in to score points but it didn't matter.

There are many reasons to skip this film. First reason is that there are a gazillion other movies out there JUST like it. Second reason is that many of those other films are much better than this in terms of acting and the dancing. Third reason is that this movie was just too cliche' to be interesting.

Supposedly Andie comes from ""the streets"" but she is no more street than John McCain! She's an unattractive tomboy who is trying too hard to be tough and the actress doesn't fit the role. She looks ten years older than the age of her character and so does the blond guy who is the supporting star. They both look at least early 30's trying to pass for teens. Their romance was unbelievable because they didn't have any chemistry at all. This movie would have been better if it centered around Andie's old crew that was ""really"" from the streets. They kept this film alive through all the boring and draggy spots.

The main characters are wooden and they cannot act. They are obviously professional dancers and not actors. The dance moves are cute (at times) but nothing new. If you're gonna do another dance movie, the moves should be different than anything that's been done before. This film copied all of their dance moves from films like ""Stomp The Yard"". NOTHING was new! The only difference was that Stomp The Yard was much better and the dancing was fierce.

I don't know why Step Up 2 was made but this is definitely a sequel that shouldn't have been. This is a ridiculous movie. I admit it's entertaining on a low level if you're not expecting much or if you haven't seen a dance flick before. If you haven't then you might think these moves were new but they weren't. There was nothing original about the dancing, actors or the plot. I've never seen so many cliche's in ONE movie.

This movie was also unrealistic. The worst part was the street dance competition in the end. There would be no way that these clean cut wannabes would have even been allowed to go into an inner city club or participate in an innercity dance contest! They would have been beaten up if anything. That was too fake for words. The film didn't properly address the racial tensions and how serious street dancers are with their turf. Everyone is not welcomed and not just anyone can participate. If this film was gonna truly show how things are with the dance groups of the real streets, then they should have done some research. In real life they would have eaten those white kids up for lunch. I understand that the message of the film was to ""bring people together in the streets through dance"" and that's great but they should have tackled the rougher issues in the film to truly show the importance of that message. The characters should have been confronted with real hardships and struggles and they weren't.

Please skip this one if you are spending money. Watch it on Starz for free like I did. The economy is too bad to waste money on a movie like this that you can predict from the time it starts to the time it ends. If you want to watch a GREAT dance film that will blow you away  with some good acting and some folks from the real streets, then check out, ""Stomp The Yard"". Now that's how dancing is REALLY done in the streets!",1248220800,6,3486,4.4375
3094865,2,B0012QCZ54,"I will be part of the limited few who probably say that this movie just wasn't really good. I for one was bothered by the fact it had NO story line or real plot, because other than that, what did we really have? Five minutes of genuinely good dancing and 1+ hours of no real relationships between the characters. My first question was watching this film: Who is Andie? I did remember that she was the adopted sister of Tyler in the first movie? I guess that must've been it. Realistically, it did not tell me in the movie itself. Tyler shows up in one scene, but it still does not tell me, what happened to him? What happened to his girlfriend? How many years have passed? What happened to the other people they were living with? As I remember Andie, and Tyler were not the only people living with the foster parents. That's where my question started. Now onto the next part: where were the original teachers from MSA? The original principal? These were left unanswered. Apparently Andie became a street dancer with the four one O crew. The story line never told me what the relationship was between her and the leader? Was he her ex- boyfriend? Why did he care who she was hanging out with? When was the group formed? Generally, throughout the movie, too many questions were left unanswered for me and I failed to see the relationship between this movie and Step Up. I also found it strange that originally when Andie formed her new crew, they were BAD at dancing, and after 2 miraculous practices (that's what the movie showed) they became AMAZING. What I am trying to say is: this movie did not focus on the parts that it should have focused on. Like building relationships between characters or showing that these dancers practiced day and night to become good. To be honest, none of the dance moves were all that great. The ending 5 minutes in the rain where they dance was where I could say, good movie. The rest just wasn't really that good. Is it a bad movie? No, I have seen worse, was it worth getting on DVD? Probably not, because this is for me one of those watch once movies unless I want to learn a few dance moves.",1241913600,4,2129,4.433673469387755

Or when Chase gets jumped, and receives four--count 'em--four kicks to the ribs, but is dancing up a storm the next day.

Also, quite possibly the most formulaic movie ever, with traditional old-school Christian values as the controlling force.  Pleasantly moralistic.

3094885,5,B0012QCZ54,"It seems many people were disappointed in this movie due to the lack of plot or, at best, a very simple one, and the sub-par acting. In fact, I was so convinced after reading all the reviews that I would not like it as much as I thought I originally would. Regardless, I saw it used and decided to give it a shot and, I have to say, I am keeping this one.

Yes, the acting is not the best and the plot was the way to keep it together, so they could call it a ""movie"" and not a ""music video,"" but I have absolutely no complaints or problems with that at all. If you search for any of the main ""actors"" their first occupation is not acting, it is dancing or choreography and, Sarah, the guardian, used to be a slam poet and Cassie (the source of conflict) is a professional singer and dancer by trade. Needless to say, they are not actors and it shows, but I wouldn't call their acting horrible, it was decent. Yet, the thing is, I don't think this movie would be half as good if they cast actors and tried to teach them how to dance, (they have reality shows for that) what really made this movie great was the dancing and you can tell that these guys are professionals in that respect, because I have never seen such phenomenal dancing in my life. Between the catchy and upbeat music and the amazing ""popping,"" ""Krumping"" and raw street dancing this movie is definitely one I will watch again and again. In fact, I cannot stop watching the final dances in the street, especially Adam Sevani (Moose) with that awesome routine to Timbaland's ""Bounce.""

Anyway, despite what people are saying, if you like watching people dance to upbeat, high-energy music then definitely do yourself a favor and check this movie out.

Lastly, to comment briefly on the Blu Ray version. The picture quality is amazing, so much so, you can read what is on the shirts of those in the crowd and the sound is phenomenal. I can't tell you the exact specs, but what I can tell you is the picture is clear and vibrant and when they kick up the water during the dance scene in the rain, you truly feel as though you are going to get hit by the splash :) And, the sound is very clear, I have a 7.1 system set up but this DVD only does 5.1, but it makes up for it by giving me TrueHD.

All in all, if you are not concerned about a weak plot and poor acting, but really like watching phenomenal dancing, this is the movie for you. It definitely is for me.",1231545600,5,2425,4.23110151187905

3094888,4,B0012QCZ54,"STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, man, it's a clumsy film title and hearing it probably won't make you catch your breath in anticipation. But hold up. This is a pretty good musical drama. It's also a sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Up-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000J3OTSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Up (Widescreen Edition)</a>, the 2006 Channing Tatum/Jenna Dewan surpriser which made enough duckets in the box office so that, now, we get a return visit to the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts.

A wave of public disturbances has hit Baltimore, public disturbances in the way of sizzling street dancing, baby. This time out, the troubled kid is Andie (Briana Evigan), an orphan who gets in trouble because of her street gang affiliation but who then gets a second chance when she's accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But it's not all about Andie. When her time spent at the MSA gets her booted out of her street crew, the notorious 410, she forms her own crew, consisting mostly of misfit students at the MSA. And, of course, there's an ongoing underground dance competition. And, of course, there's an exhilarating, stop-the-presses dance battle at the end. Naturally, the dance-off is between the MSA crew and the 410.

It's a straightforward, by-the-numbers story, but we all know that the story is just there to prop up the spectacular dance sequences. The acting by the kids is serviceable, with Briana Evigan, daughter of Greg Evigan, holding the viewers' attention with her sexy, spirited presence. The other standout, to me, is scene-stealer Adam G. Sevani, who plays the gangly, geeky Moose. On the other hand, that guy who plays the stuffy dance director is awful.

This is a PG-13 flick, so it's got pretty tame street cred. One of the kids gets roughed up a bit and a dance studio is vandalized. The tough talking, keeping-it-real smack the kids spout here is about as tough and keeps it about as real as a 1970's Kurt Russell Disney movie. Near the end of this flick, does anyone really buy into that boisterous crowd being swayed so easily by Andie's ""We call this a battle, but what are we fighting for"" speech? Yikes!

There are some good-looking folks in this cast, so if you're wondering about the raunch factor, well, there's a kiss at the end, which I guess is smoking enough that it won the 2008 MTV Best Kiss Award, for whatever that's worth. But most of the lascivious stuff pops up in the dance routines.

Apologies to the bellylicious Briana Evigan, but the backbone of STEP UP 2 is the electrifying street dancing. While the plot here is as anemic as that of the first film, the dance elements in this sequel are even more dynamic and definitely more street-centric. Breakdancing, krumping, popping, locking, you name it, it's here. Briana herself shows off some skills, but, really, the sickest moves are demonstrated by the 410 crew, by Adam Sevani and by the actors who play Monster, Cable, and Missy. Robert Hoffman (Chase) doesn't have Channing Tatum's magnetism, but he contributes with some nifty popping. Speaking of Tyler Gage (Tatum), he drops in for an extended cameo, to add continuity and provide a link to the first STEP UP. His one-on-one dance battle with Andie happens to be one of the movie's showstoppers.

The music is so key to movies like this. The STEP UP 2 soundtrack, aggressive and with plenty of head-bopping hooks, is a crucial supporting character. Viewers be cautioned, as these songs  may induce manic bouts of getting down (or attempts at getting down). Just don't hurt yourself. Some of the hot tracks included are Flo Rida & T-Pain, ""Low,"" Missy Elliott's ""Shake Your Pom Pom,"" and Digital Underground's classic ""Humpty Dance."" This last track, by the way, is perfectly, hilariously used in the MSA crew's online prank.

STEP UP 2: THE STREETS isn't as sanitized as HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but neither does it come close to the gritty reality of, say, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rize/dp/B000ARFPOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rize</a>&nbsp;documentary. Still, the focus here is on the dancing. And, when it comes to that, the pulse of the street beats in this film.",1223769600,3,4241,5.127351664254704

So when I heard there was a sequal coming out I was fearful it wouldn't hold up to the first but I must say I shouldn't have worried I think I LOVE it even more! Channing's still in it, (his co-star from She's the Man) Robert's the new leading man and theres more dancing then the original. What else could you ask for?",1217635200,,451,3.967032967032967

That's what a dance movie should be, shouldn't it?  Rather than making the antsy viewer wait 'til the finale to enjoy some real dancing.

To comment on the acting and directing - in all honesty, it was not too shabby at all.  Obviously, they weren't going for the oscars but then the movie IS about kids from the streets who have passion for dancing.  The movie generally stays true to the spirit of that - and the credit goes to the actors and the director.  I was especially impressed with Rob Hoffman and Cassie.  Rob Hoffman, known for his edgy pranks, was very believable in his role.  Cassie, singer turned actor, also surprised me with her portrayal of Sophie - I thought she would bomb like many other singer turned actor.

Back to my point - step up and watch this movie!",1217548800,,957,4.505813953488372
3094911,3,B0012QCZ54,"Okay.  I am one of those people that when you say a movie part 2, I can only say, seriously?  Now granted Step Up was an average movie. Did not get blockbuster ratings or hit the box office hard.  I liked it though.  Channing, stud muffin.  Jenna, amazing.  Together made an average movie, with sterotypical dancing.  Step Up 2 is a less than average movie with crazy dancing.  The dancing, along with the music in this movie is nuts.  Rob whatever his name, is just rippin it in this movie.  The female lead however I wish we could see more of whatever type of dancing she does.  To me it was a showcase of the stud muffin Rob as opposed to the apparent life trials of Briana.  Then you get the person who they want to play the nerd sidekick.  Except they forgot that Adam is sicker then the chick he plays opposite of.  I really don't know how the chick dances, but in the movie everyone out shines her.  That Adam kid is crazy good.  He plays Moose, and it threw me way off when he started rippen it.  However, the dances are freakin done.  They are sooo crazy.  Granted they have their continuity errors, but still, everyone is crazy in it.  Check out the Jabowakeeze and then Rainen from them in the 410, What. When the dudes are up in the scene, they are KILLIN it!!! It is the best s!@# ever.  So whould I say watch it?  Sure.  But, I would say watch only the dance sequences.  I can promise you the music and the dances are crazy.  I would only watch the movie for the dancing.  Acting, not so good.  Dancing, worth it.",1217289600,,1527,4.229965156794425
3094912,4,B0012QCZ54,I was absolutely blown away by the dancing in this movie.  The acting is fine and I was drawn in by the characters.  The rain dance scene at the end is in itself alone worth the price. Absolutely astounded!,1216425600,,206,4.256410256410256
3094913,5,B0012QCZ54,You always wonder if the sequal will be as good as the first one I will tell you this it was that and then some lol :) I loved it Channing Tatum is not only hot he is also in this movie at the first part of the movie. He is a great dancer all the choreography in this film is as good as the first film. The soundtrack is even better:),1216339200,,334,3.6527777777777777
3094914,4,B0012QCZ54,"Step Up 2 was so much fun, I think I was smiling the entire time I was watching it, not to mention on the edge of my seat wanting to dance.  I thought the first Step Up had some amazing choreography, but the story line was a bit slow and got bogged down for me by the stale romance and the whole death thing.  Isn't there a  tragic gang-related death that spurs the protagonist to dance as he has never danced before?  I guess I was so underwhelmed, I don't even remember the details.  I certainly don't need to see Step Up ever again, but I am eagerly awaiting the DVD release of Step Up 2.  I went to Step Up 2 because I go see all teen dance movies, but I was pleasantly surprised by the innovative dance sequences, the likeable characters, and the engaging storyline.  Whatever was missing for me in the first movie was there in abundance in the sequel.  It's so nice when a movie that could be another teensploitation piece of corporate money-making junk is actually well-crafted and clearly made by a group of creative people who really care about it.  I am a bit of a film snob myself, but I strongly believe that commercial film can be good and innovative, not to mention great fun.  Step Up 2 is a fine example.",1215907200,,1220,4.288209606986899
3094915,5,B0012QCZ54,"I loved this movie.  I was afraid it would be low budget like some sequels are, but I was plesently surprised.  I loved everything about it.  I will definatly buy it when it comes out.",1215475200,,184,4.2
3094916,5,B0012QCZ54,"Everything about this film FAR exceeds the first in the series. First of all, the actors are way more talented, in both their dancing and acting skills. Where Channig Tatum was practically robotic in the original, Rob Hoffman is charming and funny.  Brianna also adds a good element, because where Nora was the goody two shoes, Brianna's more tough, and fights for what she wants. And the dance sequences will absolutely blow you away.  Rather than looking overly rehearsed, the moves come across as smooth and amazing.  The plot as a whole seems to be less cliche-y as well.

I think that this is a movie that anyone can enjoy, but it seems that people are split on which is better.  Some think the first is better, while others prefer this newer, more hip version. Either way, this movie is DEFINITELY worth checking out!",1215475200,19,823,4.6875
3094917,4,B0012QCZ54,"The music and dancing just blew me away. Way cool! The story itself is quite nice, but just watch the way all the actors can move! I was strapped in my seat because I watched this movie in the airplane, but if I was at home, nothing could have stopped me from dancing along (or kind of). I love Andie, the heroine. She had skill in acting, dancing, and always had a cool outfit (not to mention).

This movie is kind of different from the first, but not any worse. Go ahead and buy this movie, or rent it at Blockbuster. But first make sure that when you watch it, you have the speakers on loud and have plenty of space to dance!",1214611200,,628,4.105691056910569

3094920,5,B0012QCZ54,I thought it was a lot better than the first because there was a lot more dancing and I think these characters are easier to relate to.,1212451200,,135,4.037037037037037
3094921,2,B0012QCZ54,"Okay, I'm from Baltimore where both of the Step Up movies were filmed, not to mention that Jenna Dewan (Nora Clark) is my FAVORITE actress.  So as an absolutely HUGE fan of the original movie I was ecstatic when I found out that they were filming a sequel.  Then I found out that they were filming a sequel ... sort of.

Don't get me wrong, Step Up 2 is a decent movie, but it unfortunately suffers from the proverbial curse that says ""the sequel is never as good as the original.""  Now it COULD have been, there was HUGE potential in a sequel if it was taken in the right direction.  But in my opinion, the failure to have both Channing Tatum AND Jenna Dewan back was a mistake.  I would have loved to have seen the sequel present Nora (Jenna) as an instructor at the Maryland School of the Arts.  Maybe Tyler (Tatum) as a student.  FOLLOW THE STORYLINES OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE!

But no, Channing Tatum was in the sequel for all of about ten minutes and Jenna's character was only barely mentioned.  Maybe there is hope f or a third movie that would bring back the REAL star of what could have been an amazing movie franchise.",1211846400,7,1126,4.319047619047619

3328461,3,B0012QCZ54,"...and dance they do! And they do it very, very well.

4.5 stars for the jaw dropping moves these kids are able to do but a mere 2 stars for everything else, so let's round that to 3 stars shall we.

Though it's been said over and over again about other movies of this ilk, there has to be more to a movie than the dancing and as far as Step Up 2 the Streets goes, the other stuff just doesn't really cut it.

The film chronicles - did I say chronicles? - sorry, no, this movie doesn't chronicle anything, it's about a young street dancer named Andie (Briana Evigan). She's beautiful, out of this world talented and certainly doesn't want to be shipped off to Texas which is where she's headed if she doesn't stop getting into trouble.

Andie gets accepted into the elite Maryland School of the Arts (MSA) where she attempts to widen her dancing scope to more classical styles. Her street dancing crew the 4-1-0 - all but one of whom does not know Andie is now enrolled in the school - become sick and tired of the excuses she gives as to why she isn't able to attend practice with them and they eventually kick her out of the crew.

This is where I find the character flaws in the movie to be really apparent...these kids are obviously in their late teens and 20s, however they spend all day dancing in the streets, Have they no jobs?? No responsibilities?? How do they pay for the cost of living? Don't they even take a break to make some deals or turn some tricks?? It's not just that they are sooo devoted to dancing and preparing for a dance battle called ""The Streets"", the writers make it seem like they genuinely solely exist to practice their dancing 24-7. No one has to go home because their baby-mama is always nagging, no one has goals or dreams, their only purpose in the film is to dance...and still with all that practice they still don't have what it takes.

Fortunately, all these annoyances are seasoned with superbly choreographed and exceptionally performed dance numbers that make the knot in my forehead relax until the plot gets back underway.

Andie decides to put together her own crew made up of static, clich outcast kids that go to MSA. There's the Asian girl who thinks she's ""down"" but you can't understand a word she says, the tall-loner girl no one hangs out with, a guy who's supposed to be the nerdy guy, but this isn't really developed, a few others not worth mentioning and the other main character, Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman).

When we first hear of Chase, we are immediately led to believe that he is MSA royalty but living in the shadow of his older, more talented MSA faculty brother and also that his dancing skills have given him a sense of entitlement making him something of a playa with the ladies. This would be all well and good, for Chase would be a well-developed character and even have opportunities for growth as he tries to redeem himself from his philandering ways and woo our heroine Andie. However, as soon as we get to know Chase, he's not like this at all, in fact none of the earlier descriptions of him are mentioned again or developed at all - he's just a regular boring guy with nothing extraordinarily good or bad about him. But, like everyone else in the film, he's great looking...and man, can he dance!

Alright, so the ""plot"" eventually brings us to the ultimate street battle called, no less, ""The Streets"" between the new crew and the old crew in a rain-soaked climax I won't ruin it for you (really, if you have to ask who wins you just don't get how formulaic this film is). This dance-off is well worth the wait as the choreography is spot-on. The scene could not have been shot with more skill, you can see how fluid the dancing is, nothing is chopped up which leaves the viewer in awe at how many laws of physics are shattered by the moves these kids are able to do!

Another thing worth mentioning is the supposed-nerdy kid named Moose (newcomer Adam G. Sevani) who befriends Andie at MSA, he's a kid who we see is stuck in the wrong major once we see his entertaining freestyle moves. He makes the most of the character given him and probably saves the story that falls flat in between dance numbers. Maybe, just maybe, one day he'll be the Jason Biggs of a new generation.

In summary, don't get me wrong, when I left the theater I was smiling and wishing I had those mad skills. You just have to know what to expect before you see the movie or you may wind up being too disappointed to really appreciate how superb the dancing is. Thus, if dancing is your thing, do lower your expectations as regards plot and characterization and do cop this disc and you too will be wowed and blown away by the dancing as these kids Step up 2 The Streets.",1209945600,4,4722,4.422324510932106

I never expected that nerdy character to bust out ""Michael Jackson-style"" on the stairs.

3328464,1,B0012QCZ54,"I'm not the only person who saw the cultural insensitivity of this movie! I think it's in ""fluff pieces"" where stereotypes are particularly dangerous: The story claimed that it wanted to showcase how dance and hip-hop transcend cultural and class divisions, but it only served to highlight and exploit these barriers. I hold the writers more responsible for this missed opportunity than the director, though. A few simple plot changes could have given the storyline the level of emotional intelligence that even a cartoon deserves.  It's easy to believe that observations like this will fall on deaf ears, but I hope that people (in audiences and in the movie industry) will be more considerate before they decide to patronize such ignorance.",1208563200,5,742,5.132231404958677

In the first movie you have more story and less of dance and in the second movie you have less story and more dance so go see it!!!!!,1208304000,,291,3.634920634920635
3328466,5,B0012QCZ54,"The fellow below me is, in all aspects, correct. If what you look for in a dance movie is to be highly distracted by a shabby plot. Me, I loved Step Up 2 for this very reason...

Most dance movies aim too high: they want killer dance scenes -with- an excellent plot. What do most wind up with? Trite, familiar plots they still try to execute even though we've seen them before (so we know well enough to follow along) while still delivering a sliver or two of dance sequences... but nowhere near the amount the usual viewer wants to see.

Now, Step Up 2 says a big ""yeah right"" to that entire idea.

There is next to NO plot. Yeah, it's there, barely. Enough to pretend that it's not one long music video. But, it really IS like one long music video--and that's wicked awesome. The dance scenes are long and intricate, the music is great, and it delivers on everything I want to see in a dance movie: less talking and more dancing.

So if you're into these sorts of movies for the chick flick value, it might be a skip or a rent. But if you're into it for, well, the dancing--I give it 5 stars.",1205452800,41,1094,4.220095693779904

And there is NO WAY that lead actress came from the streets (even her eyebrows were manicured). Her co-star came off as a cheating jerk of a boyfriend, as opposed to a romantic, and both looked way too old to be in high school. This movie lived and breathed in cliches, from the ""transformed underdog from the streets"" (who is, as always, played by a white lead) to the dorky loner with a secret talent for dance. This movie is not worth watching. Skip it and watch the dance sequences online.",1424044800,,643,4.4576271186440675

The characters, the music and the dancing. The plot isn't something you have not seen before, but that's okay. The film is pretty much about the dancing more than anything else and that is okay. The two leads are charming and have chemistry. Moose is also charming. He has become a fan favorite. To me he made part 3 decent. The ending is one of best endings ever. None of the other SU films can top it. ""Step Up 2: The Streets"" is a fun and entertaining film. I believe all ages will enjoy it.

3329320,4,B0012QCZ54,"""Step Up 2: The Streets"" is a sequel to ""Step Up"".  This movie features different characters, but continues similar themes of urban teens navigating relationships and expressing themselves through hip-hop style dance.

I wonder if anyone watched ""Breakin"" 1, 2, ""Krush Groove"" or ""Beat Street"" in research. Know your history.. (on a side note, it would have been interesting to get Adolpho Quinones and Michael Chambers to play some bit parts.)

The film is surprisingly effective. It's clearly a formula film, broadly in the underdog-youth-team-of-misfits genre. Whatever the various plot holes, it is very professionally shot and put together. Excellent choreography and cinematography.  There is also plenty of hip-hop dance music by contemporary artists of the genre (a bonus CD soundtrack would have been nice for the DVD release.)

That the main point-of-view characters/romantic leads were Caucasian was somewhat to be expected for a major studio film. To the filmmakers credit, they did feature a multi-cultural cast, though only a few of the characters are given personalities.
It's unclear how much of her own dancing that Briana Evigan did, but she's sympathetic and compelling as the tough-but-sensitive Andie.

Some quibbles: Several of the characters here don't rise above stereotypes, (the talented dork Moose, the bullying rival crew leader Tuck.) It's curious that the director, John Chu, is Asian-American, and the one prominent Asian character is a foreign exchange student with a choppy accent who speaks in clipped catchphrases. And does anyone from the 'hood dance crews go to school at all? (To that point, I suppose it was nearly unavoidable, but many of the actors/dancers featured here skew too old to pass as current high school students. Though I'm sure this is neither here nor there with the target audience for the film.)

""Step Up 2"" earned even more money than its predecessor at the box office.  It is a technically proficient film and hits the right notes for its genre.  Children and teens will get the most out of watching this.",1329004800,3,2065,5.195783132530121

Briana Evigan (Baby Bear since she is the Daughter of the star of the old TV Show BJ and The Bear) is beautiful and can really dance. The main reason I love this movie is the dance sequences are amazing especially the one on the train and the final part of the movie.

John Chu keeps making movies with the greatest dancers around - including the least expected people. Moose, for example, is my favorite out of this entire show.

3329340,3,B0012QCZ54,"All of the dancing movies I've seen so far have been weak in everything but the dancing, and this one is no exception, especially when it comes to the plot and character development.  That might not be a problem for immature teenagers, but anyone beyond that level will strain to suspend their disbelief in the face of the steady stream of flaws this movie presents.  On this basis, this movie is lucky to get 2 stars.

On the other hand, I watched this movie primarily because I love dancing, and the dancing in this movie was pretty good - not amazing, but still pretty good.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the dancing doesn't really show up until the final showdown scenes of the movie, and in fact perhaps the best dancing is to be found while the final credits are rolling, as well as in the bonus materials.  Particularly egregious in this regard is putting the JabbaWockeeZ performance in the bonus materials and only showing a small sample in the movie itself.  The director, John Chu, makes the excuse there wasn't time to include this material in the movie, but I don't buy it.  Given that this is a *dance* movie, all of the best dancing should have been included in the movie, and the resulting omission of non-dancing nonsense would have improved the movie, not worsened it.

Nevertheless, I can still give the dancing 4 stars, so 3 stars for the movie overall.  Considering that lukewarm rating, I wouldn't say that I wasted my time watching this movie, but I can't really recommend it either, unless you're able to overlook its weaknesses.",1282348800,,1551,4.672794117647059

3329345,2,B0012QCZ54,"Saddled with a screenplay that wouldn't earn a passing grade in a Cinema 101 course, ""Step Up 2 the Streets"" is an urban fairy tale about an orphaned crew dancer (Briana Evigan) from the 'hood who is accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts.  But can she find a home with the assortment of geeks, preppies and classically-trained arty types who attend the school?  And can she succeed as a student without turning her back on her ""homies"" from the old neighborhood?  Or will she be forced to form her own crew from dancers at the school to compete with the Big Boys out on the streets?

You can write the script yourself, but the key selling-point of this sequel to ""Step Up"" - sort of a mash-up of ""Fame,"" ""Footloose"" and ""School of Rock"" - is clearly not the storytelling but the dancing.  And in that respect it delivers the goods.  So ignore the predictable plotting, the tinny dialogue, the corny inspirational speeches, the wafer-thin characters, the obligatory montage sequences and the amateurish acting, and simply revel in the moves, street-dance or otherwise, that permeate the film.  It's not much in the way of compensation, I know, but at least it's better than nothing.",1259193600,6,1189,4.742718446601942
3329346,4,B0012QCZ54,"Okay, so these new wave dance flicks are a dime a dozen, and half of them are just mediocre offerings with one impossible dance move after the next.  When `Step Up' came out I really expected nothing from it, but I got a sensational and really, really great movie that had enough heart and chemistry to make it stand out amongst the onslaught of trashy teen dance movies.  Really, you need to see it!  So, I was excited about the prospects of `Step Up 2: The Streets', but after seeing the trailer I was afraid it was going to be nothing more than a rehash of the same story with different actors.

So I waited.

I am happy (so happy) to say that `Step Up 2: The Streets' does not have the same story, even though it is slightly similar.  It does lack the chemistry that made the original so charming, but the lead actress, Briana Evigan, carries enough saucy charm to make up for Robert Hoffman's lack of everything (the guy is kind of gross creepy here).

Andie is a teen with no real purpose.  Her mother dies when she was young and she's been living with her mother's best friend.  She finds herself at a crossroads when her ties with the infamous 410 (a dance crew) leave her with two options; a prestigious dance school or Texas.  Now, I live in Texas, so I understand why she opted for the school.  She doesn't fit in (of course) but she finds herself flirting with even more danger when the school legend Chase Collins takes a liking to Andie, and her dance style, and convinces her to join forces with him, and a slew of talented yet overlooked students, in order to take on a street dancing competition.  Love develops, feelings are trampled, rivalries are started...and dancing HAPPENS!

Like I said, Evigan is great.  She is sensual with a kick of edge that keeps her interesting; and that smoker's voice is just, UGH, so Scarlett Johansson...me loves it!  Robert Hoffman is the opposite.  He is supposed to be all charming and sweet and lovable but he comes across creepy.  The rest of the cast is really just a collection of moving bodies, and they all work well in that respect.  Miss Ventura is stunning to look at whether she's moving or standing still, I'll give her that.  Black Thomas (yes, that is his name) is respectable as the token gangster (very clich, but whatever) and Danielle Polanco is quite engaging as the street-smart and genuinely sweet Missy.

But this is not about acting, believe me.

The dancing is insane here, and the final dance scene, in the rain, is just UGH, WOW...that was hot!  Yes, I said hot, and I meant that in like every possible way.  I did want to mention Adam G. Sevani (who looks like `Year One' version Michael Cera) who is your typical `nerdy kid who befriends outcast' here.  The reason I mention him is because his Michael Jackson inspired dace sequence at the end is phenomenal and easily the most memorable part of the entire movie.

So, if you want a fun and entertaining film with lots of dancing then this is the one for you.  It doesn't have the `everything' factor that the original had, but it makes up for it in other areas.

There are many reasons to skip this film. First reason is that there are a gazillion other movies out there JUST like it. Second reason is that many of those other films are much better than this in terms of acting and the dancing. Third reason is that this movie was just too cliche' to be interesting.

Supposedly Andie comes from ""the streets"" but she is no more street than John McCain! She's an unattractive tomboy who is trying too hard to be tough and the actress doesn't fit the role. She looks ten years older than the age of her character and so does the blond guy who is the supporting star. They both look at least early 30's trying to pass for teens. Their romance was unbelievable because they didn't have any chemistry at all. This movie would have been better if it centered around Andie's old crew that was ""really"" from the streets. They kept this film alive through all the boring and draggy spots.

The main characters are wooden and they cannot act. They are obviously professional dancers and not actors. The dance moves are cute (at times) but nothing new. If you're gonna do another dance movie, the moves should be different than anything that's been done before. This film copied all of their dance moves from films like ""Stomp The Yard"". NOTHING was new! The only difference was that Stomp The Yard was much better and the dancing was fierce.

I don't know why Step Up 2 was made but this is definitely a sequel that shouldn't have been. This is a ridiculous movie. I admit it's entertaining on a low level if you're not expecting much or if you haven't seen a dance flick before. If you haven't then you might think these moves were new but they weren't. There was nothing original about the dancing, actors or the plot. I've never seen so many cliche's in ONE movie.

This movie was also unrealistic. The worst part was the street dance competition in the end. There would be no way that these clean cut wannabes would have even been allowed to go into an inner city club or participate in an innercity dance contest! They would have been beaten up if anything. That was too fake for words. The film didn't properly address the racial tensions and how serious street dancers are with their turf. Everyone is not welcomed and not just anyone can participate. If this film was gonna truly show how things are with the dance groups of the real streets, then they should have done some research. In real life they would have eaten those white kids up for lunch. I understand that the message of the film was to ""bring people together in the streets through dance"" and that's great but they should have tackled the rougher issues in the film to truly show the importance of that message. The characters should have been confronted with real hardships and struggles and they weren't.

Please skip this one if you are spending money. Watch it on Starz for free like I did. The economy is too bad to waste money on a movie like this that you can predict from the time it starts to the time it ends. If you want to watch a GREAT dance film that will blow you away  with some good acting and some folks from the real streets, then check out, ""Stomp The Yard"". Now that's how dancing is REALLY done in the streets!",1248220800,6,3486,4.4375
3329362,2,B0012QCZ54,"I will be part of the limited few who probably say that this movie just wasn't really good. I for one was bothered by the fact it had NO story line or real plot, because other than that, what did we really have? Five minutes of genuinely good dancing and 1+ hours of no real relationships between the characters. My first question was watching this film: Who is Andie? I did remember that she was the adopted sister of Tyler in the first movie? I guess that must've been it. Realistically, it did not tell me in the movie itself. Tyler shows up in one scene, but it still does not tell me, what happened to him? What happened to his girlfriend? How many years have passed? What happened to the other people they were living with? As I remember Andie, and Tyler were not the only people living with the foster parents. That's where my question started. Now onto the next part: where were the original teachers from MSA? The original principal? These were left unanswered. Apparently Andie became a street dancer with the four one O crew. The story line never told me what the relationship was between her and the leader? Was he her ex- boyfriend? Why did he care who she was hanging out with? When was the group formed? Generally, throughout the movie, too many questions were left unanswered for me and I failed to see the relationship between this movie and Step Up. I also found it strange that originally when Andie formed her new crew, they were BAD at dancing, and after 2 miraculous practices (that's what the movie showed) they became AMAZING. What I am trying to say is: this movie did not focus on the parts that it should have focused on. Like building relationships between characters or showing that these dancers practiced day and night to become good. To be honest, none of the dance moves were all that great. The ending 5 minutes in the rain where they dance was where I could say, good movie. The rest just wasn't really that good. Is it a bad movie? No, I have seen worse, was it worth getting on DVD? Probably not, because this is for me one of those watch once movies unless I want to learn a few dance moves.",1241913600,4,2129,4.433673469387755

Or, when Andie gets an audition to the traditional ""stuffy ballet school"" in less than 24 hours.  Or when Chase gets jumped, and receives four--count 'em--four kicks to the ribs, but is dancing up a storm the next day.

Also, quite possibly the most formulaic movie ever, with traditional old-school Christian values as the controlling force.  Pleasantly moralistic.

Anyway, the interesting thing about this movie (to me) is that Hip-Hop dancing is no longer for the amateurs.  Hip-Hop is now learned in schools, with training as rigorous as ballet.  And it shows, for this movie is over-charged with great dancing.  Quite amazing!",1235174400,,792,5.077519379844961

3329382,5,B0012QCZ54,"It seems many people were disappointed in this movie due to the lack of plot or, at best, a very simple one, and the sub-par acting. In fact, I was so convinced after reading all the reviews that I would not like it as much as I thought I originally would. Regardless, I saw it used and decided to give it a shot and, I have to say, I am keeping this one.

Yes, the acting is not the best and the plot was the way to keep it together, so they could call it a ""movie"" and not a ""music video,"" but I have absolutely no complaints or problems with that at all. If you search for any of the main ""actors"" their first occupation is not acting, it is dancing or choreography and, Sarah, the guardian, used to be a slam poet and Cassie (the source of conflict) is a professional singer and dancer by trade. Needless to say, they are not actors and it shows, but I wouldn't call their acting horrible, it was decent. Yet, the thing is, I don't think this movie would be half as good if they cast actors and tried to teach them how to dance, (they have reality shows for that) what really made this movie great was the dancing and you can tell that these guys are professionals in that respect, because I have never seen such phenomenal dancing in my life. Between the catchy and upbeat music and the amazing ""popping,"" ""Krumping"" and raw street dancing this movie is definitely one I will watch again and again. In fact, I cannot stop watching the final dances in the street, especially Adam Sevani (Moose) with that awesome routine to Timbaland's ""Bounce.""

Anyway, despite what people are saying, if you like watching people dance to upbeat, high-energy music then definitely do yourself a favor and check this movie out.

Lastly, to comment briefly on the Blu Ray version. The picture quality is amazing, so much so, you can read what is on the shirts of those in the crowd and the sound is phenomenal. I can't tell you the exact specs, but what I can tell you is the picture is clear and vibrant and when they kick up the water during the dance scene in the rain, you truly feel as though you are going to get hit by the splash :) And, the sound is very clear, I have a 7.1 system set up but this DVD only does 5.1, but it makes up for it by giving me TrueHD.

All in all, if you are not concerned about a weak plot and poor acting, but really like watching phenomenal dancing, this is the movie for you. It definitely is for me.",1231545600,5,2425,4.23110151187905

3329385,4,B0012QCZ54,"STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, man, it's a clumsy film title and hearing it probably won't make you catch your breath in anticipation. But hold up. This is a pretty good musical drama. It's also a sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Up-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000J3OTSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Up (Widescreen Edition)</a>, the 2006 Channing Tatum/Jenna Dewan surpriser which made enough duckets in the box office so that, now, we get a return visit to the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts.

A wave of public disturbances has hit Baltimore, public disturbances in the way of sizzling street dancing, baby. This time out, the troubled kid is Andie (Briana Evigan), an orphan who gets in trouble because of her street gang affiliation but who then gets a second chance when she's accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But it's not all about Andie. When her time spent at the MSA gets her booted out of her street crew, the notorious 410, she forms her own crew, consisting mostly of misfit students at the MSA. And, of course, there's an ongoing underground dance competition. And, of course, there's an exhilarating, stop-the-presses dance battle at the end. Naturally, the dance-off is between the MSA crew and the 410.

It's a straightforward, by-the-numbers story, but we all know that the story is just there to prop up the spectacular dance sequences. The acting by the kids is serviceable, with Briana Evigan, daughter of Greg Evigan, holding the viewers' attention with her sexy, spirited presence. The other standout, to me, is scene-stealer Adam G. Sevani, who plays the gangly, geeky Moose. On the other hand, that guy who plays the stuffy dance director is awful.

This is a PG-13 flick, so it's got pretty tame street cred. One of the kids gets roughed up a bit and a dance studio is vandalized. The tough talking, keeping-it-real smack the kids spout here is about as tough and keeps it about as real as a 1970's Kurt Russell Disney movie. Near the end of this flick, does anyone really buy into that boisterous crowd being swayed so easily by Andie's ""We call this a battle, but what are we fighting for"" speech? Yikes!

There are some good-looking folks in this cast, so if you're wondering about the raunch factor, well, there's a kiss at the end, which I guess is smoking enough that it won the 2008 MTV Best Kiss Award, for whatever that's worth. But most of the lascivious stuff pops up in the dance routines.

Apologies to the bellylicious Briana Evigan, but the backbone of STEP UP 2 is the electrifying street dancing. While the plot here is as anemic as that of the first film, the dance elements in this sequel are even more dynamic and definitely more street-centric. Breakdancing, krumping, popping, locking, you name it, it's here. Briana herself shows off some skills, but, really, the sickest moves are demonstrated by the 410 crew, by Adam Sevani and by the actors who play Monster, Cable, and Missy. Robert Hoffman (Chase) doesn't have Channing Tatum's magnetism, but he contributes with some nifty popping. Speaking of Tyler Gage (Tatum), he drops in for an extended cameo, to add continuity and provide a link to the first STEP UP. His one-on-one dance battle with Andie happens to be one of the movie's showstoppers.

The music is so key to movies like this. The STEP UP 2 soundtrack, aggressive and with plenty of head-bopping hooks, is a crucial supporting character. Viewers be cautioned, as these songs  may induce manic bouts of getting down (or attempts at getting down). Just don't hurt yourself. Some of the hot tracks included are Flo Rida & T-Pain, ""Low,"" Missy Elliott's ""Shake Your Pom Pom,"" and Digital Underground's classic ""Humpty Dance."" This last track, by the way, is perfectly, hilariously used in the MSA crew's online prank.

STEP UP 2: THE STREETS isn't as sanitized as HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but neither does it come close to the gritty reality of, say, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rize/dp/B000ARFPOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rize</a>&nbsp;documentary. Still, the focus here is on the dancing. And, when it comes to that, the pulse of the street beats in this film.",1223769600,3,4241,5.127351664254704

To comment on the acting and directing - in all honesty, it was not too shabby at all.  Obviously, they weren't going for the oscars but then the movie IS about kids from the streets who have passion for dancing.  The movie generally stays true to the spirit of that - and the credit goes to the actors and the director.  I was especially impressed with Rob Hoffman and Cassie.  Rob Hoffman, known for his edgy pranks, was very believable in his role.  Cassie, singer turned actor, also surprised me with her portrayal of Sophie - I thought she would bomb like many other singer turned actor.

Did not get blockbuster ratings or hit the box office hard.  I liked it though.  Channing, stud muffin.  Jenna, amazing.  Together made an average movie, with sterotypical dancing.  Step Up 2 is a less than average movie with crazy dancing.  The dancing, along with the music in this movie is nuts.  Rob whatever his name, is just rippin it in this movie.  The female lead however I wish we could see more of whatever type of dancing she does.  To me it was a showcase of the stud muffin Rob as opposed to the apparent life trials of Briana.  Then you get the person who they want to play the nerd sidekick.  Except they forgot that Adam is sicker then the chick he plays opposite of.  I really don't know how the chick dances, but in the movie everyone out shines her.  That Adam kid is crazy good.  He plays Moose, and it threw me way off when he started rippen it.  However, the dances are freakin done.  They are sooo crazy.  Granted they have their continuity errors, but still, everyone is crazy in it.  Check out the Jabowakeeze and then Rainen from them in the 410, What. When the dudes are up in the scene, they are KILLIN it!!! It is the best s!@# ever.  So whould I say watch it?  Sure.

Isn't there a  tragic gang-related death that spurs the protagonist to dance as he has never danced before?  I guess I was so underwhelmed, I don't even remember the details.  I certainly don't need to see Step Up ever again, but I am eagerly awaiting the DVD release of Step Up 2.  I went to Step Up 2 because I go see all teen dance movies, but I was pleasantly surprised by the innovative dance sequences, the likeable characters, and the engaging storyline.

Where Channig Tatum was practically robotic in the original, Rob Hoffman is charming and funny.  Brianna also adds a good element, because where Nora was the goody two shoes, Brianna's more tough, and fights for what she wants. And the dance sequences will absolutely blow you away.  Rather than looking overly rehearsed, the moves come across as smooth and amazing.  The plot as a whole seems to be less cliche-y as well.

Don't get me wrong, Step Up 2 is a decent movie, but it unfortunately suffers from the proverbial curse that says ""the sequel is never as good as the original.""  Now it COULD have been, there was HUGE potential in a sequel if it was taken in the right direction.  But in my opinion, the failure to have both Channing Tatum AND Jenna Dewan back was a mistake.  I would have loved to have seen the sequel present Nora (Jenna) as an instructor at the Maryland School of the Arts.  Maybe Tyler (Tatum) as a student.  FOLLOW THE STORYLINES OF THE ORIGINAL MOVIE!
