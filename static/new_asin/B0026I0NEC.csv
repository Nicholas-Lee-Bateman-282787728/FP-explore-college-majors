3853387,5,B0026I0NEC,"I sat with a contented smile for most of this movie and really loved it. It is a fable and fairytale. Girl (Anushka Sharma) has married a not very attractive reserved nerd (Shahrukh Khan) in what is an arranged marriage. He decides to bring happiness into her life with the help of his hairdresser friend (Vinay Pathak) by reworking his image and becoming her dance partner. Like Lois Lane she falls for the cute trendy full of life dance partner but doesn't see it is her husband (also a Kent like figure in glasses!)
For him the dilemma is who is she in love with-his real simple self or the part he is acting- and can she only be truly happy if he exits the stage as her husband and chooses the fun version. If I see one place they could have tinkered it would be that the `cool dude' act wasn't just an act to be left behind or chosen between. It was also an unlived side of an inhibited male who could have eventually brought more of this into his `real' side and loosened up more.
I really love the colour, dance and music of this one. It is in the best tradition of good-hearted Bollywood fable and it suits me completely.
I have no quibbles at all with Shahrukh who can play tenderness and openhearted love with great depth and sensitivity so I don't mind when he goes a bit into over-the-top or mischievousness (which he doesn't do that much here anyway).I don't think he does this too much here though some others have thought so. I agree with someone who pointed out that if an awkward nerd tried to act 'cool' it would have an overdone look to it as it feels false and unfamiliar. That's all I saw here too.
There is also an item number where he dances with a string of major starlets: Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Rani Mukherjee,  Preity Zinta and Lara Dutta.
This was just a thorough entertainer and one that did fairly well in India after a generally lacklustre string preceding it. It is of the family entertainer style and doesn't pretend to be anything else so if you like that style you are likely to like this. If you are one for reality and art it may not be for you.
Elsewhere on the Net it gets above average ratings (e.g. 7 out of 10) but with many giving it a 10 out of 10 so it depends on your taste. But my co-viewer and I who are in quite different age-groups both gave it the 5 out of 5). With so much bleak and reality-heavy offerings around recently this is a little shining light that will remain a favorite with us.
I think those new to Bollywood would find it very entertaining but for someone for me who is now quite familiar with the genre this is one I feel very warm and fond about as it represents what Bollywood has become for me.
Highly recommended for romantics and lovers of this sort of entertainment.",1240790400,3,2737,4.304263565891473
3853388,4,B0026I0NEC,"To most, a Yash Chopra production is synonymous with big doings - of storytelling done on a lavish scale, of an extravagant love story, and the brightest talents in Bollywood. RAB NE BANA DI JODI happens to falter on several of these elements. But while it may not be on the same tier as past Yash Chopra classics (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dilwale-dulhania-le-jayenge/dp/B0016GOJM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dilwale dulhania le jayenge</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Veer-Zaara/dp/B0009XBR5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Veer-Zaara</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fanaa/dp/B000I0RW80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fanaa</a>, etc.), it's still very much worth watching. Bollywood megastar Shahrukh Khan, as expected, carries this romantic comedy.

On her wedding day Taani (Anushka Sharma), young and vivacious, receives the shocking news that the bus carrying her fiance enroute to the wedding had crashed, with her fiance numbered amongst the casualties. Taani's professor father, upon learning the news, suffers a massive and eventually fatal heart attack. On his death bed, her father, not wanting Taani to be alone, talks her into entering a marriage with his favorite student Surinder Sahni (Shahrukh Khan).

Surinder is a nondescript-looking guy, one of those unnoticed types who toil in his cubicle, working as he does for the Punjab Power company, responding to all phone calls with what I think is a pretty neat company motto, ""Punjab Power, lighting up your life."" Surinder (or Suri)  is bespectacled and quiet and kind, and becomes instantly smitten with Taani. But he understands that his marriage to her is only one of conveniece, Taani frankly declaring that she could never fall in love with him, even though she vows to fulfill her wifely obligations. Suri, never expecting someone like Taani to enter his life, professes himself content.

Things go on like this for a time, with Taani continuing to mope and with her and Suri sleeping in separate bedrooms. One day Taani sees a flyer for Dancing Jodi, a dance school competition, and she decides to participate. Suri, longing to see her happy and dancing again, pays for the dance classes and then dons a disguise so that he could be near her, not in a pervo way but so that he could enjoy the sight of her having fun. For the introverted Suri, things are about to get ridiculously out of hand.

It doesn't really make sense, but somehow Suri's best friend is this outgoing, macho salon owner (yes, I said ""macho salon owner!"") named Bobby Khosla. Bobby does a makeover on Suri and transforms him into this hip, happening cat named Raj Kapoor. Raj wears tight clothes, has poofy hair, and tends to be loud and obnoxious. Thru the luck of the draw, he ends up being Taani's dance partner. Taani dislikes him within moments, but, then again, you know how these movies go. Soon enough, thanks to Raj's antics, Taani is laughing and feeling alive again. And Suri, trapped in a web of his own making, soon finds himself in a fight for his marriage, with his alter ego as his rival. It's all very twisted, but fun.

Fun, because the tone doesn't ever get to that dark place. Shahrukh Khan plays the strutting Raj Kapoor as a caricature, exagerrated and over-the-top. Raj isn't very likeable, but then I don't ever think he was meant to be. It's weird, even keeping in mind that Raj and Suri were the same person, I still could not warm up to Raj. As Shahrukh says in an interview: ""The essence of the whole thing is, that you're going to love only one guy - and that is Suri."" That's one dichotomy in Shahrukh's dual roles. I don't think much of his portrayal of Raj, even if Raj's resulting traits were deliberate on Shahrukh's part (I'm guessing he intended him to be this aggravating). Obversely, Shahrukh's self-sacrificial Suri is sweet and heart-breaking and thoroughly endearing. As Shahrukh also says, ""Ninety-nine percent of the people are Suris,"" and so many of us Average Joes see ourselves in Suri. With due respect to the showstopper number ""Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte"" - in which Shahrukh gets to dance with some of the most famous actresses with whom he's co-starred in the past - it's the terrific ""Haule Haule"" which really captures my attention. ""Haule Haule"" embodies Suri's gentle spirit and the depth of his feelings for Taani. In the song, when he beams with happiness and does that little dance, one simply cannot help but be won over.

The subplot to all this, of course, is the Dancing Jodi competition. You can probably guess how it ends. RAB NE BANA DI JODI (which I think means ""A Couple Made By God"") has its flaws but the effervescent tone, the romance, the nifty songs, and the touches of humor should have you overlooking those failings. It certainly made a killing at the Indian box office. This is Anushka Sharma's cinematic debut, but you wouldn't know it by her self-assured performance and her chemistry with Shahrukh, especially when Shahrukh is playing Suri; it's these two characters whose moments together construct the crux and the romance of the story. And Shahrukh Khan is Shahrukh Khan, in Bollywood the star of stars and his Suri having become one of my all-time favorite roles which this actor has ever brought to life.

What I didn't like? Okay, I initially had some trouble buying into Taani's Lois Lane complex, with her just being unable to pierce thru Suri's fairly simple disguise, but I eventually shrugged it off. Because, I guess, since she doesn't spend a lot of time with her husband (only at breakfast and dinner and the occasional movie date) and since the man is habitually so reserved, I can see where it may be difficult for her to put two and two together. In her place, would it occur to you that someone so internal could put on such an audacious act? Another nitpick is that I just found ""Raj Kapoor"" to be so annoying and not once did I feel that he was a character in his own right. And then there's Taani's late epiphany which, to me, simply smacks of the quick fix resolution.

What I have is the nice two-disc set with the glossy 3D hologram cover, although it's not cool that Disc 1 sits right on top of Disc 2. Disc 1 offers the feature film (which is 2 hours 44 minutes long) with English sub-titles and the typical song selection option. Disc 2, with the sizable special features: the Making Of RAB NE BANA DI JODI featurette (45 minutes long); the Making Of the musical number ""Haule Haule""; the Making Of the musical number ""Dance Pe Chance""; the Making Of the musical number ""Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte,"" which in addition to featuring five of Shahrukh's past female co-stars is also an homage to different eras of Bollywood (although I think the musical number """"Woh Ladki Hai Kahan"" from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dil-Chahta-Hai/dp/B00007LZ79/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dil Chahta Hai</a>&nbsp;did this better); 6 minutes of deleted scenes (no sub-titles); Shahrukh Khan Unplugged - 62 minutes of SRK - and his ego but with that wit and that twinkle in his eye as a saving grace - as he reflects (mostly in English) on sundry topics like this film's director Aditya Chopra, SRK's film preparation, his dual parts Suri and Raj, the importance of getting newcomer Anushka Sharma as his romantic leading lady, his tight relationship with the Chopra family, etc.; Shahrukh and Anushka In Conversation (43 minutes, chunks of it in Hindi), but definitely get around to just before the 32 minute mark to hear an utterly fascinating bit as Shahrukh answers Anushka's question: ""Who is Shahrukh?""; and the theatrical trailer and promos.

Despite Raj Kapoor, I ended up really liking RAB NE BANA DI JODI. The ending is very good, even though you do see it coming. The movie has its good share of funny moments, although, as usual with Bollywood, sometimes the humor is forced. But do keep an eye out for the hilarious Dhoom sequence, in which Taani finds umbrage with two fellow dancers on a motorbike and goes tearing off in pursuit thru the tiny streets on Raj's own motorcycle (with Raj on the back). Then there's the funny epilogue to that scene, as Raj fills in his disbelieving but still macho best friend Bobby on that story (and remember that Bobby knows that Suri is Raj):

- Bobby: ""So your wife was riding the bike?""
- Suri: ""Yes.""
- Bobby: ""At the speed of 120?""
- Suri: ""Yes.""
- Bobby: ""And what were you doing?""
- Suri: ""I was sitting behind.""
- Bobby: ""What were you doing at the back?""
- Suri: ""I had to hold the handbag, right?""

It's funnier in the movie.",1240617600,50,8680,5.015961138098542
3853389,4,B0026I0NEC,"I just saw this movie last night and despite my reservation about the typical stereotype of Bollywood movies, I watched this film just because Shahrukh Khan was in it. I know he's kind of average actor, but he is always entertaining to watch. Plus I find him to be really cute! Anyways, for once, I find his acting to be quite good in this movie - not over the top like in his previous earlier films. Perhaps he has matured throughout his acting career? I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The music song and dancing is - as always - great.",1240444800,,537,4.38
3853390,4,B0026I0NEC,"I've been a fan of Bollywood films for almost eight years now and I can say that most of them, perhaps 98% of these films are not great due to actors who are way overrated and simply cannot act, stories that go on forever, childish dialogue, over the top melodramatic scenes, and so on. But they sure are entertaining. Even though I find Shahrukh Khan to be a mediocre actor, he does a great job of entertaining in this film. He takes on two different personalities and expertly portrays the dimensions of the characters. The music is fantastic.

3853401,4,B0026I0NEC,"Vivacious, beautiful Taani (Anushka Sharma) suffers a catastrophe on the eve of her wedding, and at her father's request, she marries his trusted student Suri (Shah Rukh Khan).  Serious, nerdy Suri fell in love with her at first sight, but Taani tells him she'll never be able to love him, nor be happy and light-hearted again.  Suri takes on the role of a fun-loving Raj in her dancing class, hoping to make her laugh again, and hoping to use Raj to help Taani fall in love with Suri.  Things don't work as Suri had hoped, and he sees his chance of happiness with Taani become slim.

In this romantic drama, Khan plays an average man as Suri, and brash and loud as Raj, neither the handsome or charming character that is his usual role. This he does suprisingly well.  Sharma, in her first role, was excellent, and fully believable in her emotions. While the songs and choreography were average, the cinematography, locations, and sets were lovely.

I was conflicted as to the credibility of Taani's reaction to the truth, but otherwise found this to be a sweet and enjoyable film with a beautiful message, celebrating unselfish love.",1505520000,,1135,4.7360406091370555
3853402,5,B0026I0NEC,"This movie is another special piece of work by a fabulous actor, Shah Rukh Khan. I am an elderly anglo-American  who has just this past few months met and fallen in deep admiration of one of India's National Treasures in his man. He is a fabulous actor, humble and amazing person, and great family man and all around human being. The duel parts he plays in this and Fan, Don, and Duplicate display his really wonderful acting skills with each one of those films offering a slightly different take on the notion of one man playing two parts. But there was something really special about this film. From the dorky young man who marries Anushka's character in order to rescue her from being alone when her father and fiance both die on the same day to the hip flirtatious dance partner who teaches her how to feel and laugh and love again, SRK really hits a winner with this one.",1504396800,,876,4.475

If I could marry this movie and have its children, I would. 30 minutes in, and I knew it was one of my favorite films and 2nd favorite Bollywood film (nothing will ever beat ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"" for me). This was so sad and so sweet, and it was funny without deviating into hammy slapstick humor, which Bolly films are sometimes want to do. The songs are some of the best Ive seen, and Shah is amazing as the lovesick nerd. I just wanted to cry at how adorable he was. This was some of his most honest acting. Hes a great actor, but he usually just plays differentiations of a hero character. His alias ""Raj"" was sort of that, but you kept believing it was Surinder in disguise. I think despite how good his films always are, this one has a lot more tenderness and believability in regards to the heartache hes feeling. Im devastated that no one I know will see this. Im sad that Bollywood films aren't more common. I used to think they were just silly dance films, but then I started watching them. These films ""render our grief and happiness on screen and give us a golden reason to live"" (stole that from ""Billu Barber""). They make me feel so happy, and have the power to make you believe in true love, happy endings, heartache, family, God, being ridiculous, singing and dancing. Im so glad that the message of this film was that even an ordinary man can be the hero of his life. (Also KAJOL has a cameo in a dance sequence, which keeps happening in Shahs films, and I don't know about them, so when it happens, Im immediately shot straight to Heaven).",1474934400,13,1576,4.327702702702703
3853442,4,B0026I0NEC,"Surinder is a meek, awkward office worker married to the beautiful Tania.  While he deeply loves her, she does not return the feelings and only married him after the death of her fiance.  So Surinder adopts a new identity as the outgoing, motorbike-riding, Bollywood dancing Raj and creates a love triangle with himself!  The film handwaves the unlikely idea quickly as 'God's will' and jumps right into the story.

It's an absurd premise requiring us to suspend a lot of disbelief, (maybe Tania is really, really nearsighted?) but the delivery more than makes up for it.  In his double role Shahrukh Khan manages to breath life into both Surinder and Raj.  The musical numbers deserve special mention too, even among Bollywood musicals the spectacle in Rab Ne, is incredible.  One show-stopping number, Pher Milenge Chalte Chalte, contains homages to fifty years of Indian film with a half dozen major sets and production numbers.

If you accept the premise, Rab Ne is a great love story and a fantastic musical.",1474848000,,1013,4.952662721893491

I loved it from the beginning; a beautiful story. You have to give it a little tolerance when he takes on his 'incognito' role and all, at first, but this movie will most probably win your heart completely well before the end, and is so full of great songs, music, and scenes, clothing, sacred in places, loving and surprising, tender, alive moments, plenty of great dance (but not the usual Bollywood style dance since this is partially a dance class type movie). It may seem a bit over-acted if you're used to Western movies, but give it some time and maybe you'll love it, too. This is one of my top 5 favorite Bollywood movies and it's unforgettable; surprise ending. Shahrukh Khan is so loveable in this; and his acting range was never more apparent in the way this movie plays out at least at the time of this review.",1467936000,,962,4.471590909090909

I have watched about forty of his films which is about half of his body of work. So I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly! And yes he does sometimes over act. And yes he can be over the top emotional at times, but as a line in a Hindi movie put  it "" no one does a love story like Shah Rukh Khan!"" So having said all that I love this movie because it is a different twist on the story of an arranged marriage, it has fun music and dancing, it introduced the very talented and charismatic Anushka Sharma, and it is SRK playing a double role! I love how he is the ultimate performer and show off, never afraid to play the dorky Suni or the exaggerated, over the top character of Raj.
For me it is just clean entertainment  plain and simple.",1443484800,3,848,4.011834319526627

I don't get it at the end though, when his wife falls in love with the packaging and heart of her husband's alter ego, that he continues to wear his nerd ware. Since he was willing to develop the altar ego, why not look as good as he can? Anyway, I'm not a fan of musicals, but I loved the music and the dancing in this film. There was a lot of variety in the dancing which I recognized in Michael Jackson's Thriller and other music videos. This movie had humor, romance and a little mystery thrown in. The religion side of it and the crude scene where he is joking around in his bedroom, made it impossible for me to recommend the film. But I did like his character's humble, sincere and giving personality. The acting was good from all parties. The main actress made the film entertaining as well.",1427241600,,985,4.387978142076503

SPOILER ALERT

This is a story about an arrangement. A couple is married under circumstances of tragedy (the death of her fianc and father). Surinder is a man a few years older than his wife Taani. He is simple, reserved, and more of an introvert. Taani is from a younger generation and enjoys the pleasures of youth, but still has great morals. They live in separate bedrooms and hardly interact at all. Surinder longs to be closer to his wife and hatches a plot to woe her, but this goes wrong when he takes on the identity of Raj, a carefree auto-mechanic. He expects that when he plays Raj that it will push his wife towards him (her husband) and not Raj (fake identity that she doesn't know is her husband). This backfires as she falls head over heels in love with Raj.

What started out as a man who wanted to become more interested in his wife's interests, turned into a battle to win the heart of his wife away from his fake self.",1417478400,,1040,4.350515463917525

SRK, it seems, can do no wrong. No wonder he is the second wealthiest actor in the world (Seinfeld No1-imagine that). As the self proclaimed shy geek,  Surinder Sahni (and his alter ego the extroverted Raj) woo the wonderfully talented and beautiful Taani (Anushka Sharma). This is just a wonderful love story.  (Hey, she is actually Taani Sahni..........).

Dance, colors, choreography, music-all brilliant.

Jodi as best as I can tell, means couple or pair. Tried to translate the title, but could not-Anybody know?  As best as I can tell-
""There is an extraordinary love story in every pair........."" .

Bollywood films (at least that I've seen) don't get popular success by relying on gratuitous violence. There's actually a great script here.

For a superb film buy this talented actor, SRK is brilliant in the more serious leading role in ""My name is Khan""-a 5+ star movie. (I do not rate all films that highly).

Surinder is a quiet, hardworking man who visits his favorite past teacher while the teacher's daughter is planning her wedding.  Tragedy strikes and crushes Taani's heart which also deals a hard blow to her dad's health.  On his deathbed he asks his favourite student and his younger and less experienced daughter to marry so as to relieve worries that she will be left without someone to take care of her.  The two agree and they are quietly married. Taani believes she will never be able to love again and so expects to fulfill her wifely role without love. Surinder (love at first sight) enlists the help of a friend to win her heart.  He has to jump out his comfort zone and appear as someone else.  The following bumbling adventure changes both of them.  I love shows that show marriage as something where you work hard together and for each other's happiness, so this is right up my alley.

Yes, the story is corny and predictable but the way it is shown, is so sweet and tender. Watching it just makes you feel the heart wrenching wanting that SRK's character feels, knowing his new wife (marriage not by her choice) does not love nor likes being in his company. It is heartbreaking seeing how he tries so hard to make her comfortable and happy, even though she doesn't appreciate it or him. Then you experience the joy and laughter as he becomes another person, just to be near her and experience a side of her that she will not show to him.
My favorite part was when they went to the temple, mosque and church and he sang to her, ""I see God in you"" from 2 perspectives. Such a beautiful, beautiful song; I love all the songs in it. As usual, the predictable happy ending with a twist. I loved this movie and just about anything with SRK in it. I love him to death and slowly collecting as many movies with him as I can get!

3853556,5,B0026I0NEC,"Why I chose this rating?  My goodness, all the actors worked so well together!  I got 2 cds, one was about the behind the scenes.  I was not familiar with the female lead, but the director said that he was looking for someone pure.  This young lady pulled it off.  She was able to hold up her own against Sharukh.  It was an amazing interplay of emotions, as deep as Devda, only with a better ending.  The gentleman that played the barber was really good at setting up Sharukh's character and explaining the plot or the intricate complexity of their little ruse drawing more emotional anguish and suspense as opposed to just letting you figure things out yourself!  You must see this to see what it means to be a brilliant supporting actor.  As for Sharukh himself, his ego is a little up there. He brags about the wrong things, see behind the scenes.  He just simply did a good job at being humble not at forgetting he was famous.  The scene involving the mustache was hilarious.  His voice, his aura, his mannerisms were unbelievably refreshing and comical... Nay nay nay, don't touch the mustache, as they were trying to figure out a disguise.....  And then when he's swaggering back from the river as she prays to see God .  He is in his humble outfit  but his walk now is more confident.  All these subtle details her peculiar spooked reactions of deja vu are what makes this a fun movie to watch!  The song ties the whole theme together, seeing god in someone.

3853560,5,B0026I0NEC,"TOOK the Blu-ray of Rab Ne Bana and I'm still enthused of the film even 14 months later. This is a certified classic, its not just a SRK vehicle but a Blu-ray collectable. The recent BDs I owned featuring SRK are disappointments, most notably Yash Chopra's very last film Jab Tak. The male lead has done almost nothing in at least 60% of the film but show this cloying sweetness in all the scenes with Katrina Kaif. That's the same annoying cloying sweetness shown in Dil - SRK's film that's shoot entirely in New York, with some effeminate/gay hints inserted to spice things up - but has only added to drag the film downward to an embarrasing & much-deserved obscurity. But Rab depicted SRK as a totally believable chameleon, when he acted the part of the ultra-cool pretended alter-ego, he didn't essayed that as an Indian cool dude but as a Sikh bachelor with a coolish attitude. The female lead on the other hand is unendingly enchanting, a triumph for a neophyte for her first film. The only other comparable performance from Sharma is Baaj Baraat - another topnotch BD collectable in Hindi cinema. Sharma is wasted in Jab Tak, but Rab Ni has portent what she could capably do doing musicals.

The finale is sumptuous & superb, in fact I spare this precious film from being watched ""merely"" on the family's Kuro TV. I screened it on a 90"" projector screen beamed from an aged Yamaha front projector, where the enchanting Jodi dance - and the awesome ""discovery"" - is glorious. I need not tell more, this is money well spent, as well-spent as Farah Khan's Om Shanti Om on BD, and on a lesser scale, Pyaar Impossible and Love Aajkal. This is one instance of an ""almost-perfect film"" - as if the stars just align together on that season when they helmed this (just like how Sound Of Music, Wizard Of Oz, Vertigo turned out), all filmmakers wants to evoked a magic to each & every picture, but oftentimes that magic is elusive and couldn't get duplicated handily on the next picture....",1381276800,2,1987,4.612994350282486

In Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Surinder Sahni (Shah Rukh Khan), a quiet, unassuming man, is attending the wedding of his former Professor's daughter, Taani  played by Anushka Sharma, Debutante.  Surinder, the Professor's most favourite student, agrees to marry Taani after the unmitigated and disastrous  circumstances on the wedding day.  Was it love at first sight that made Surinder agree to the arrangement or was he fulfilling the Professor's deepest desire?  Regardless of his decision, it was undeniably a bittersweet pact!  Taani, surrounded by devastation, agonized with grief and disbelief, with the power to love seared from her heart,  concedes to her dying father's wishes.  After performing the funeral rites she weds Surinder, then leaves with him for Amritsar to start her new life.  Surinder works for Punjab Power - lighting up your life ji, so the telephone greeting goes.  Will Surinder be able to light up Taani's life after the numbing  pain of loves lost? Will Taani be able to love again after admitting she had no more love in her to give?  Can Surinder live without love she asks?  Surinder decides as  the song, Haule, Haule describes, to take it, Slowly, Soft, Slow.  Life settles into a routine then one day Taani sees an advertisement for dance classes and Surinder gives his consent.  There at the dance Hall, Taani meets Raj, colourful, loud mouth and flirtatious whom she considers cheap!  They have involuntary become dance partners.  Taani could never have imagined how the power of love by another could work its magic and awaken love in her again.  Can Surinder who she finds dull and boring open her heart to his innate good nature?  Could she love him for who he is or will he lose her to his alter ego?  ""Tigh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai"" heartrendingly sung by Roop Kumar Rathod and Shreya Ghoshal  begs to be recognized and to see within, the Divine!  Will Taani see through the facade to the true self?  In her dream scene of the song and dance sequence Phir Milenge, Chalte, Chalte, sung by the resourceful Sonu Nigam, Shah Rukh pays homage to 5 Bollywood super stars of the past, Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Shammi Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and Rishi Kapoor!  Shah Rukh Khan's versatility as an actor knows no bounds.  He gives another ingenious and dynamic performance.  The songs, the lyrics and the music make this a memorable film not to be missed!

A Special Edition, the set comes with 2 DVDs, one of the film itself, the other with Special Features, such as the making of the film and songs, along with Shah Rukh Khan's interview with co-star, Anushka Sharma.  The behind-the-scenes features gives rare insight into Shah Rukh Khan's character and of his consideration, kindness and gentleness with his co-stars.

Eventually I decided to buy the movie, although I generally don't have the patience for subtitles. However, I was instantly drawn into this movie by the colors and production quality of it. While the premise of ""man and woman aren't into each other until one takes on a new identity and hilarity ensues"" is relatively old hat, the musical interludes, thematic discussions, and actors' commitment to the roles makes this movie an exciting romp through a different culture.

The most exciting thing about this movie was how familiar and alien it was - the plot was pretty classic American romcom/updated Shakespearean dilemma, but the presuppositions, activities, sights, and culture were decidedly Indian. That made this surprisingly educational, thoroughly engrossing, and ultimately relatable.

I would recommend this to anyone with the ability to read subtitles and the maturity to see the world differently than you see it.",1358035200,2,1149,5.233695652173913

3853602,5,B0026I0NEC,"If you like love stories you will love this one! I loved it.

This movie is about an ordinary working man and his love for his wife.  Shahrukh Khan is wonderful as both Surinder Sahni and Raj. As Surinder Sahni (Suri) he is a regular working man.  Suri is quiet to the point of shyness. Raj is brash and bold to the point of being over the top!

Suri goes to visit with a former teacher. When he sees and meets Taani (played by Anushka Sharma) he falls in love with her. Taani is so vibrant and happy. The day Suri meets Taani is to be her wedding day.
As Suri is enjoying just watching Tanni's joyful anticipation of her coming marriage to the man she loves there is a commotion. Suri can tell the commotion is not good. As he watches Taani runs into the house crying. Taani's father collapses clutching his chest!
Taani's father is rushed to the hospital. Suri also goes to the hospital. You find out the Taani's father has had a major heart attack.

Taani's father is sure he will die. He asks Suri if he will marry Taani so she will have someone to take care if her.
After they are married Suri wants to make Taani happy so badly that he and his friend Bobby create an alter ego Raj. Raj is the exact opposite of Suri. Raj is flamboyant and so cocky that Taani thinks he is cheap kind of guy.
On the way home from the market Taani sees an advertisement for a dance competition. She loves to dance so she takes flyer home and asks Suri if he would mind her entering the competition. He doesn't answer her at first, but  later when she looks at the table he has left her the money for the competition.

Raj shows he has heart after he sees just how much it means to Taani to win the dance competition. You see Raj can't dance. Raj tries to dance, but remember in his everyday life he is an ordinary working guy.  Raj says to her ""Taani partner I think you should change your dance partner.  See I know that my dancing is even worse than my talking...but you are just the best! You will surely come in first. But if I am your partner you will certainly loose...and I really won't like to see that happen. So then it's fixed that from Monday you'll find a new partner.""

This is when Taani starts too really like Raj.

When Raj doesn't show up on Monday Taani goes looking for him. She convinces Raj to learn to dance. He responds with all the love in his heart.

Taani and Raj are chosen in the top ten for the dance competition.

In the mean time Suri's heart is breaking because he can tell Taani is falling in love with Raj. Suri's friend when he learns of this twist in the love story he is so upset he tells Suri it is no wonder Taani is falling for Raj! Raj is very bold in telling Taani how he feels while Suri ""keeps his love in a Tiffin box."" Bobby tells Suri that we are all human and want to be loved.  Bobby tells Suri that he needs to express his love for Taani loud and clear with all his heart, and then Taani will never look at another Raj!

Suri tries to by fighting a Sumo wrestler for tickets to take her to Japan, but what is the result?!

Will their love story continue...who will she love Suri or Raj...watch and see!",1305676800,,3140,4.1652892561983474
3853603,4,B0026I0NEC,"I have no idea what ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" means.  It should be ""A Tale of Two Husbands.""

A young, life-loving woman (Taani) loses her fiancee and her father in the same week. On his deathbed, the father asks her to marry steady, dependable, and bland Suri, one of his previous students.  They marry, but Taani makes it clear to Suri that she will never be able to love him, because her previous experiences with love remain too painful.  But Suri is in love with her, and develops a plan to crack open Taani's shell.

With the help of his best friend, a male hairdresser, Suri (Shahrukh Khan) develops a new persona, Raj, a hip macho man ""living on the love train.""  Taani (Anushka Sharma) begins taking hip-hop dance lessons, and Raj (Suri) joins in, ending up as Taani's dance partner.  The make-up artists are very good here, because there was a huge difference between the looks of Suri and Raj, and certainly in their behavior.  Now, will Taani fall in love with Suri or Raj?

That is the story.  You'll get it with great songs and dance, humorous scenes, touching events, and a little help from Sui's good friends.

Fun movie.  Mostly in Hindi (?), with occasional English phrases thrown in as well.

3853609,5,B0026I0NEC,"This was the second Bollywood movie I ever saw. The first was Bride and Prejudice, which I call my gateway movie; it suckered me in by my Austen addiction and then delighted me unexpectedly - India has had far, far longer to learn to incorporate (rely on!) music and dance to tell a story (rather than interrupt or stretch it) than Hollywood or Broadway. It even proved to my musical-despising husband that not all musicals are poorly-paced, irritatingly interrupted by pointless songs, and boring.

If Bride and Prejudice was the bait, Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is the hook, and it was weeks before I realized how deeply it sank. I kept watching it as a Netflix Instant Play, but by fifth time, I realized I should probably just buy it outright.

The most basic plot premise: man falls ever more deeply in love with his own wife, tries to win her love in return. Awww!

<<--minimal spoilers-->>
The details: Attending the wedding of his favorite teacher's daughter, the reserved, almost expressionless Surinder Sahni falls in love at first sight with the ingenuous and carefree laughter of the much younger bride, Taani. The plot takes a couple of sudden turns and she ends up marrying Surinder instead, but is so traumatized that she tells him, ""I will never be able to love you. I will be a good wife to you, but my heart is dead and I cannot love again."" Surinder tells her he has never known love and feels no need for it in his life. Of course, he has lied; he does know love. He fell in love with Taani the first time he saw her, of course. But, as the song ""Haule, Haule"" (""Slowly, Slowly"") explains, he believes that love should develop ""soft, sweet, slow"", and is prepared to give Taani all the time and space she needs to heal and recover herself. Surinder's love begins selfless and becomes self-sacrificing, wanting only to see Taani happy and laughing again, asking nothing in return but the possible rebirth of her smile. Meanwhile, her tiniest dutiful actions (packing his lunch, making his breakfast) bring a complicated, sweet, touching smile spreading across Surinder's frequently immobile face -- in private, when nobody is around to see. Outwardly, he treats her with expressionless deference and distance, asking very little of her and sacrificing much for her comfort and happiness; he moves himself into the attic (claiming he always sleeps there) to give her the bedroom to herself.

Taani emerges from her state of shock and begins to respond to his gentle, considerate care with ""dutiful"" actions that make Surinder feel pampered and cared-for in return; even if she does not love him as she had her fiance, he tells her that her small actions are enough love for him, and we witness his understated, reserved glows of happiness in response. He comes home from work and the dusty, cluttered, cobwebbed attic is clean and spacious, decorated, with fresh flowers on his nightstand. This example, and several other developments, happen in a few seconds each during ""Haule, Haule"" -- you have to watch the action during the songs, because plot and character development happen there too, in a manner so condensed and dense with implication I can only compare it to poetry. If you get up for a snack during the song-and-dance bits because you can still *hear* from the kitchen, you will miss much of the depth of the movie. Surinder's love does develop, softly, sweetly, slowly, from crush-at-first-sight to the adoration expressed in ""Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai"" (""I See My God In You""). Taani's feelings remain locked away, frozen and unchanging. Everything she does, she does dutifully, mechanically, because it is what she owes her husband. (That sense of debt becomes pronounced late in the film, almost wrenching in another brief scene far too easy to miss the significance of.)

Yes, there is the surface plot - Taani joins a dance class/competition, and Surinder undergoes a radical makeover and dozens of dubious quick-changes to pose as the brash, loud, and frankly irritating Raj during the evenings, in order to attend the classes with her. ""Raj"" is able to flatter, flirt, and romance brazenly in a way Surinder never could without the anonymity of disguise. There are faint resonances with Cyrano de Bergerac as Raj tells Taani all the things that meek, awkward, almost shrinking Surinder could never bring himself to say. They are partnered together in their dance lessons, and gradually a ride home on ""Raj's"" motorcycle becomes after-lesson dinner and a birthday date. Despite spending hours every day dancing, dining, and laughing with Raj, Taani never suspects that her colorful, swaggering dance partner is actually her mousy, quiet husband. Surinder suspects that Taani is falling for Raj, becomes jealous (of himself!), and despite a friend's advice that ""Either way, it's you she's loving!"" decides to force the issue and find out who Taani *really* loves -- the man she laughs for, or the man she cooks and cleans for.

Yes, it's full of holes in the description; it seems questionable that Raj spends so much time with Taani while Surinder puts in a full workday, even if the dance classes are stated to be ""in the evening"". It strains belief that a woman wouldn't recognize her own husband just because he shaved off his mustache and dresses differently. There's a lot to question here, if you expect the movie to force-feed you each and every explanation, Hollywood-blockbuster style, and it's then only a 2- or 3-star movie depending on how badly inconsistency and spasmodic character development grate on your nerves.

But if you're willing to watch closely, follow subtleties of expression, ask yourself how things are changing and why, and put yourself in the characters' shoes, you will see that the ""Match Made By God"" is in the details, and the movie flows gorgeously. The smallest things, the nuances of Shah Rukh Khan's performance as Surinder (and unguarded moments as Raj), the song sequences, show a rich, mature exploration of different kinds of love, different styles of self-expression, different ways to say ""I love you"", and ultimately the wealth of emotion and interdependent partnership that can grow between two very different people. Taani believes she loved her fiance so deeply, so passionately she will never feel again; Surinder's love runs so deep it hardly shows at all.
<<--end spoilers-->>

This was also the first Shah Rukh Khan performance I had ever seen; I'm now a thorough addict. His talent shines through brilliantly, even in the (intentionally) shallow characterization of the ridiculous and abrasively over-the-top Raj, and especially comparing that to the restrained, complex, nuanced expressions of Surinder. I was amazed I had never seen or heard of this actor before. I understand entirely now why Wikipedia says ""Khan is today considered to be the world's most successful movie star, with a fan following numbering in the billions..."" He deserves it, and I am picky about actors. He holds his facial muscles differently for each character, so that their faces have different shapes, and that makes the implausible deception easy to play along with. His dancing is excellent, but borders on divine if you notice how he manages to bring the body language of the two different characters into the dances as well -- Surinder's dancing is graceful and precise in contrast to his awkwardness, while Raj is still all broad sweeps and jerking motion -- and how it's in dance that Raj and Surinder reconcile and merge as their distinctive movements blend. Just. Seriously. Brilliant.

Or maybe I'm reading too much into it by now, having seen it so many times... no, you know what? There's no such thing. It's there to find. The first time I watched this movie, I found it sweet and touching; as I catch more details, I find it heart-wrenching and buoyant. I can no more resist tearing up at the first few notes of ""Haule, Haule"" or ""Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai"" than I can on hearing Leonard Nimoy say ""...and will always be... my friend."" It's far from all-tragic; I have to laugh in pure joy whenever I hear ""Taani-partner!"" as much as on hearing Christopher Eccleston say, ""Everybody lives, Rose! Just this once, EVERYBODY lives!"" (No, Bollywood is not my usual fare, why would you ask?) The more I watch, the more I see, understand, and love in this movie, and that there *is* always more to find, between the sterling direction and outstanding performance, is what turns the plot into an all-time favorite must-own comfort movie instead of a paper-thin slice of Swiss cheese. And if you wish they'd followed the story a little further, make sure to watch the closing credits.

My ONLY complaint, not worth even a quarter of a star, is about the DVD rather than the movie itself: I cannot find any way to get subtitles on the end credits (though the rough meaning comes through regardless) or the special features on the second disc. (Roughly half the interview content is English, mixed into the Hindi, and the deleted scenes are completely Hindi with maybe a loan word or two, and my Hindi is so far limited to ""(Ji) haan"", ""(Ji) nahin"", ""Kyaa?"" and ""Namaste"".) Oh, well. Maybe I'll find that detail in here too, someday.

If you have any doubts, rent the movie. If a week later, the thought of a man laying a single rose next to his wife's breakfast plate, then reconsidering, deflating, and putting it back in the vase, isn't etched into your mind's eye with a poignant mingling of hope and regret... well, watch it again. Soft, sweet, slow, the implications will unfold.",1288224000,17,9552,4.879235982747997

It is a moving love story, a story of two best friends - yaars, and of a professor/mentor and his student.  I cry every time I watch it.  SRK in his too tight pants versus his awkward hand gesters and tennis shows an average guy working in a cubicle for Punjap Power - lighting up your life.

The plain guy can find love and beauty but it will probably not happen to every plain Jane and Suri.  It is a sad fact of life.  This movie tells of a success story for the non-SRK in real life.",1284681600,2,598,3.9008264462809916

I love a movie that can both make you laugh and move you to tears. Anushka Sharma delivers a great debut as this was her first film. She is believable both as the enthusiastic young bride to be at the start of the movie and as the broken young woman we lament with through the remainder of the film.

3853616,5,B0026I0NEC,"A great performance always seems, falsely, on the precipice of failure - and then soars, bringing us along. Something astounding like this happens with Shahrukh Khan in ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi,"" Aditya Chopra's blockbuster hit that earns every bit of its fame. Watching Khan, you lose track of the narrative, because the movie works so much off movement. Essaying a man who assumes the identity of another into order to make his new bride (Anushka Sharma, who holds her own) happy, Khan expresses his alter egos almost completely physically. What Khan has lost in muscle as he ages, he has gained in tone and supreme agility - mentally and physically, he has become a dramatic dancer. This is an actor who has embraced expression of character above speed, in sharp contrast to his contemporaries. Movements take on breathtaking fluidity -  he is part Astaire, part Kelly. With the mid-mannered Suri, the husband, the limbs curl inward and the man literally feels compact, contained. As the flamboyant Raj (Kapoor, no less), the self-proclaimed ""hero"", the body blossoms, so that even his fingers seem to open up. For Raj, show-stoppers abound, particularly the golden-era Bollywood pastiche ""Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte"", and I was petrified that the movie would ultimately extol Raj over Suri, because that is what movies do. It's not clear what the song sequences with Khan and some of Bollywood's biggest names are at first - homage, perhaps parody?  It turns out they're critique. The director, Aditya Chopra, takes the iconography of Bollywood conventions, milks them, then jettisons them. I can't think of another Indian movie in which the ""hero""'s bravura moves are only half as impressive as those of an alter ego. (Astaire wins.) Because the movie has the courage of its convictions, what you're left with is the purity of Khan's brave performance, and the whole movie is as radiant as the sunflower yellow that dominates its palette. ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" babbles plenty, even piously about the primacy of god, but it proves an entirely different thesis -  the supremacy of human beings in the creation of art.",1279238400,5,2116,4.9886685552407934

The plot seemed dead, almost annoying on the back of the DVD when I first read it. However, actually watching the story unfold, brought along a sense of depth with a smile.

This story would have remained airy if it wouldn't have been for its cast. SRK is almost unrecognizable and humbling as Suri, while funny yet sensitive as Raj. Anushka Sharma, a newcomer actress does a great job as Taani. Her performance is 95% believable, a breath of fresh air from those overacted, dolled up Indian actresses.

The soundtrack is -in my opinion- the soul of this film. Tracks such as Haule haule and Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai are beautifully arranged with deep lyrics. I mean what could be more beautiful than to be able to see God in that person you're with?

3853621,4,B0026I0NEC,"So says the father of the lead actress in this delightful musical on his death bed, and this also forms the central theme in the movie. Humble and unassuming Surinder Sahni (played by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan) is attending his former professor's daughter's wedding when tragedy strikes. The bride-to-be's fiance dies in an accident and the professor suffers a heart attack. On his death bed, the professor pleads with Surinder to marry his young daughter Taani (newcomer Anushka Sharma) as he fears for her future. Surinder who has already fallen in love with Taani at first sight, agrees and Taani too agrees as a means of placating her father, who dies soon after.

The wedded couple arrive in Amritsar where Surinder works for a utility company, Punjab Power. Taani is initially in a deep state of grieving but she soon rouses herself, though she makes it plain that she has no love left to give, and will be a good wife (but not a 'real' wife, the couple sleep in separate quarters).Surinder is very accepting of the situation as he feels he can win Taani over with his love for her, but his ways of showing love are so subtle that Taani is initially non-responsive to his gestures. Taani in the meantime develops an interest in a dance competition and once Surinder gives the OK, she begins lessons which leads Surinder to come up with a plan - he'll transform himself into Raj, a cool and carefree guy who will go watch Taani dance without her knowledge. But events take a dramatic turn when Raj aka Surinder finds himself being partnered with Taani in the dance competition, throwing them into close contact. This being a Bollywood drama, romantic complications ensue, leaving Surinder pondering on the wisdom of his double act.

Shah Rukh Khan or SRK is amazing as the unassuming Surinder, and this unglamorous role showcases his acting repertoire (though he has done other low-key roles before). But then, he gets the best of both worlds in this story as he also plays the free-spirited  and romantic Raj, which is closer to the roles SRK usually plays. Of course, the viewer needs to suspend disbelief here as the transformation from Surinder to Raj is not very dramatic, and one can't help wondering how Taani can't seem to recognize Raj as her own husband Surinder. The only explanation I came up with which seems plausible is the fact that Taani, being in her own world most of the time (thinking of the past, coping with her grief and sadness) does not really 'see' her husband, even when interacting with him, but clearly 'sees' Raj and gravitates to his unique brand of humor and spirited  gestures. Newcomer Anushka Sharma holds her own against veteran actor SRK and seems genuinely at ease in her role, and it helps that the lead pair share credible chemistry.

The songs are incredibly catchy and are definitely one of the highlights of the movie - look out for a medley scene where there are cameos by some of Bollywood's leading ladies such as Kajol, Bipasha Basu, Lara Dutta, Preity Zinta, and Rani Mukherjee. They sing and dance with SRK to a medley of Hindi songs from classic Hindi movies of yesteryears which were truly entertaining. The cinematography is beautiful, especially the scenes set around the Golden Temple at Amritsar, which is one of the most sacred shrines and places of worship for the Sikhs. This is a light-hearted movie that will have viewers smiling, and enjoying the catchy beats, and the delightful performances by the leads. Recommended!",1272585600,3,3495,4.80865224625624

I tried watching a little more of the movie, but really couldn't stomach it, flipped past that, and went over to the public television station, and it was a special of Indian Pop music, and the song being performed was in Hindi, titled ""I See God in You"". I looked up a video of the song on YouTube... Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai

You Ease My Spirit
Tu Hi Akhiyon Ki Thandak

You Knocked On The Door Of My Heart

3853624,5,B0026I0NEC,"There's nothing like a long, dark winter in western Montana to help you fall in love with the warmth, color, music and love stories of Bollywood films, and ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"" is one of my favorites.  It's a more recent film, and the quality of directing, acting, and choreography is terrific.  I especially enjoyed seeing Shahrukh Khan play a different sort of role in this movie in the character of Suri.  Quiet, shy, thoughtful, and respectful, Suri is also alluring, and the new actress, Anushka Sharma as ""Tanni"", plays very well alongside him, making their situation completely believable.

I love the storyline of this movie.  Of course the music and dance are wonderful, and part of the genre, but there is also something special and different about this film.  I've read other reviews of this movie, and few have mentioned the spirituality of the story.  Perhaps it's because I come from a culture that doesn't publically display faith, but I was touched by how faith played a role in every big decision, and especially in matters of true love.

I highly recommend this movie.  If you don't like long movies, then you probably aren't a fan of Bollywood anyhow.  For me, the time just flys, because I'm in a completely different world.  I know you can't judge a country by its films, but I now have a deep desire to learn more about India, and to someday visit that big, varied and complex land.",1268006400,4,1405,4.670731707317073

3853626,5,B0026I0NEC,"I wish I could give this film more than 5 stars. I'm a big Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) fan after seeing several of his movies, and this one is my favorite by far, due to the HIGH QUALITY ACTING. Shah Rukh plays a dual role in this film and the movie is unforgettable.

Regarding the features:  This 2 disk set is excellent quality. The movie is on the first disk, with a great feature of being able to play all of the songs in a row. Most of the time you can play one song, but then the movie continues after the song is over. Not so with this special feature, where it will take you to the next song rather than continue with the movie. There is also an easy to work scene selection for the movie itself so you can jump around as much as you want, from scene to scene.

The second disk contains some very revealing interviews with SRK and Anushka Sharma. I loved that the SRK Unplugged interview is mostly in English and it's lengthy, so it gives the viewer the chance to see Shah Rukh as himself. In the second interview on the disk, when Shah Rukh interviews Anushka, it is mainly in Hindi with no subtitles and only a little bit of English, which is disappointing. HOWEVER, you MUST stick with it until towards the end of the interview, Anushka asks SRK, ""Who is Shah Rukh Khan?"" That's when you will get a real treasure, in English, of how he truly feels about himself as a person and his acting abilities. It is quite revealing and touching to hear.

Regarding the movie:  This is a beautiful love story, and it is beautifully acted by SRK and newcomer Anushka Sharma. I found it a real credit to Anushka's acting abilities that she was able to hold her own so well when acting with such an incredible actor as SRK. Anushka was very believable and portrayed her grief over her losses very well throughout the entire movie. I especially enjoyed her acting in the scene when she suddenly ""gets it"" -- when she finally understands her connection to her husband, Suri, and all that he's done for her. When she sees God in him.

Of course it was very easy to love Suri and root for him right from the start of the movie, because he was the common man, the underdog. Suri constantly revealed his love for Taani in the way he did things for her. He was so loving as he cared for her and did everything he could to make her feel comfortable and happy. Taani, however, was too caught up in her grief and anger towards God for taking her loved ones, that she couldn't see what was in front of her face. When she finally expressed an interest in something, it was natural that Suri would want to share in her happiness, which is what led him to transform into Raj. I found it incredibly brave of mild and meek Suri to be willing to change into a completely different person just so he could spend time with his wife, Taani.

Some reviewers of this movie didn't like Raj, but I did. I could see Suri underneath the surface most of the time, which demonstrates SRK's wonderful skill as an actor.  He is absolutely hilarious as Raj, but he also shows his humanity, like in the heart-wrenching scene where Raj is drunk and talking to himself (a dummy with Suri's clothes on it) about his fears. As Raj, Suri gradually revealed his love for Taani to her, which made Taani have to finally face what was really going on in her life. The incredibly tender scene with Taani asking Raj ""What do I do?"" was just exquisite acting by both.

There are some wonderful musical numbers in this film, including some real show-stoppers. My two favorites were Haule Haule, which is Suri singing about his love for Taani, and Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai, which is Raj/Suri singing to Taani about his love for her. SRK's acting and dancing in the number Tujh Mein Rab Dikhta Hai (loosely translated ""I see God in you"") is just superb. This is the one song that I play over and over again because it's just so beautiful.

This film is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. This is the one movie I will make my adult daughter sit down and watch with me to see if she likes Bollywood. Because if you don't like this movie, you just don't get it.",1266624000,34,4114,4.345052083333333
3853627,5,B0026I0NEC,"This film is another example of SRK's excellence. A lot of people try to compare him to Amitabh and waste their time. Some say he's too formulaic while some say he's arrogant and not as good as a human being as Salman while some say he does safe films while some just love him. I belong to the last bracket of people and with this film restore my never-once dwindling faith in him.

SRK's energy in this film as a youngster trying to dance is infectious, youthful, catchy, charming and above all bloody entertaining. The film made me cry atleast twice because the music is just so sweet. There is not one thing I disliked about this film. Truly under-rated despite it's success. I expected this to be a terrible, terrible film after I saw the trailer.

So Suri hides his love, and creates an outrageous alter ego, Raj, so he can draw close to his new wife. Hilarity ensues.

Taking a ridiculous premise and making it into a hilarious and touching film is no small feat, but Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi triumphs. I have read some reviews trashing this film - ignore them. SRK shows why he is loved by a billion people in this film; his turn as Surinder is something we've never seen before, playing a humble, nerdy, sweet office worker. On the other hand, he manages to brilliantly send up his previous hero roles as Raj, an obnoxious, loud extrovert. Anushka Sharma shines in her debut; she is a pleasure to watch.

The music is great, particularly Raj's love song Tujh Mein Rab Dikta Hai and Surinder's love song Haule Haule. The dancing is perhaps not the best I've seen, Sharma seems a talented but unpolished beginner, and SRK seems to be restraining himself (which he needs to - in this film, he is only just learning to dance).

Ostensibly, Surinder marries her as a favor to his friend, but he's secretly smitten with her. Taani agrees to the marriage only because she has no other options and she misconstrues Surinder's kindness as pity. Surinder doesn't understand the first thing about women or the ways of the heart and he disastrously sets out to make her happy--and make her fall in love with him--by disguising himself as ""Raj,"" a caricature of the modern Bollywood hero--a brash, hip, cocky Casanova--a character type that Khan himself has shaped over the course of his career, and the exaggerated self-referencing is comical.

3853634,5,B0026I0NEC,"Have you ever seen a film where a really great actor or actress pulled the weight of a miscast but beautiful/handsome partner?  Sometimes it flops, sometimes it flies. In Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, it flies. Surinder (Shahrukh Khan)'s love interest, Taani (Anushka Sharma) offers a relief from the parade of Bollywood film actresses that have airbrushed, transitory good looks, with questionable dancing and acting abilities. She does an excellent job of portraying genuine happiness. However, she falls a bit short of believability with portraying ""flamboyant, fun-loving, and vivacious"" portraying rather, petulant, erratic and careless behavior ... sometimes puppies just aren't that interesting.  To get to the heavier acting, she's also not that convincing with grief, unless you believe having someone sit on a bed and feign crying and gazing off into the curtains suffices for a portrayal of the loss of a loved one. She possesses a beautiful smile, a Bollywood-ready figure and she really pulled off her happy dancing moves!

She's a new talent, and may be going places after this smash hit, too soon to tell.

The fact that the lead actor, Shahrukh Khan, is much older than his leading lady is muted and explained by the initial sequence where his mentor makes our hero promise to marry his daughter. It helps that Shahrukh Khan looks so young and is in great shape, otherwise its Harrison Ford-land with an incredibly young starlet swept off her feet by daddy/granddaddy. Surinder Sahni passes as a credible ""love interest"".

Our hero, Surinder Sahni is a very dull but loyal character. He falls for Taani instantly, and offers us glimpses of unrequited, painful love. He's got a great guy friend, Bobby (Vinay Pathak) who gives Surinder great outfits, hair styles, and how-to-be-macho advice, as well as the loan of his smokin' motorcycle. Surinder stumbles upon the path of dual identity, and becomes polar opposite as a braggart, flashy annoyance named Raj. The charade ultimately results in resolution and a merger of the personality split. Love conquers all, no giving-away-of-the-story here.

The imagination of Bollywood leaves behind all the grime and grit of the streets, offering up filmi set scenes, and people prancing around in outfits, that I've never seen anyone in India, ever wearing, oh except when Brittany Spears went hang out with her choreographer, Sandip Soparrkar, in Dec. 2008, when Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was a smash hit in Mumbai theaters.

The beautiful Golden Temple scenes, and the devotion of the characters praying lends quite depth, not to be found much in similar fantasy films from the West. The ""dark night of the soul"" when Surinder gets drunk with his guy friend, Bobby, and talks to a mannequin, comes off as vapid, and clichd; a potentially soul-filled moment is lost.

The film would be a five-star film in the theatre with all the glitz and glamour. As a DVD, it retains the five stars because of the Disc 2 extras. In addition to being able to watch the dance scenes again and again, the special features include a magnificent interview with Shahrukh Khan candidly describing his mental process with his character, his relationship with the other actors and director.

3853635,5,B0026I0NEC,"So far, the names of Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra have been behind some of India's most beautiful, romantic movies in the past decade, and this latest production lived up to my expectations, even though it is significantly different from earlier box-office hits like ""Mohabbetein"", ""Veer-Zaara"" and ""Dil to Pagal Hai"", to name a few.  The two main aspects which struck me as being most different about this lovely new film, ""Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi"", are the realistic and traditional Indian settings and the unusual story about an unlikely couple.  In most popular romantic movies, the stars are young and attractive, and although Shahrukh Khan, the star of many such popular romantic movies, also plays the lead role in this film, his character is quite different from previous roles.  In fact, he plays dual roles in this movie, which he has done to perfection several times already, and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi is yet another opportunity for Shahrukh to shine and show us even more facets of his limitless talent and abilities.  Wearing glasses and a moustache, he is almost unrecognizable as a stiff and boring middle-class working man, but as soon as he speaks, the viewer can look beyond the outer appearance and see the kind, gentle and loving soul within.  This is actually the underlying message of this story, and Shahrukh brings it out very skilfully so that the audience follows the plight of this awkward and clumsy geek who is desperate to make an attractive young woman love him for the person he really is.  With so many handsome and macho film stars to dazzle the girls, he finds this a daunting task, but is driven by love and faith in God to persist in his quest.

The situation is immediately more intriguing and complex, especially for the Western viewer, because the young woman in question is his bride whom he met only a day before the wedding, according to Indian tradition.  The first few scenes are already loaded with deep emotion and drama as we learn that the young woman's happiness over her `marriage of love' - a luxury not everyone experiences -  is shattered on her wedding day when her groom is killed in an accident.  This causes her father to suffer a heart attack, and on his deathbed quickly arranges his bereaved daughter to marry an old and trusted friend, Surinder, to take care of her.  Already in love with her at first sight, Surinder feels the pain of love for the first time in his life when she tells him she has no love left in her heart for anyone after the tragedy, but will do her best to be a good wife nevertheless.  And so begins a charming and delightful story, like a fairytale, yet real enough to tug firmly at your heartstrings, as Shahrukh, playing Surinder the geek, disguises himself as a handsome, carefree and manly dance partner in his wife's evening dance class.  Even though Shahrukh looks like his usual self as this attractive young man, his acting moves into new heights and dimensions as he plays Surinder the awkward geek pretending to be Raj, the sophisticated ladies' man.  Despite still being awkward and clumsy, she appears to gradually fall for him after all, with never a suspicion that he is in fact her dull husband,  which becomes a dilemma for Surinder:  does this mean his wife would leave him for Raj because of his outer appearance, or would she eventually see beyond the geek exterior and come to love Surinder's fine qualities?

Newcomer Anushka Sharma plays the role of Taani, the sad and lost young woman, with apparent ease and with a manner pleasantly different from the usual popular female lead.  In fact, both lead roles are deliberately different in order to create a story with a special deeper meaning to inspire audiences, even with spiritual concepts such as whether this match was made in Heaven.  For the romantically-inclined, this movie will surely be very satisfying, if not inspiring, and for Western viewers it will be an emotion-packed adventure through India and the traditions and mentality of India's people.",1247184000,28,4013,4.773121387283237

I love the part  where Anushka and SRK were on the bike immitating Dhoom. I felt some of the scenes were too melodramatic, especially towards the climax. Songs were good, especially Dance Pe Chance. A good watch with family!",1246838400,,357,4.758064516129032

8352612,5,B0026I0NEC,I enjoy Bollywood movies already but was unprepared for this gem. This movie incorporates so many different threads and weaves them into a beautiful tale of love and loss and friendship. It well deserves its five-star rating here. The dance scenes were incredible and the lead actors pulled hem off beautifully. The story line seemed to incorporate all of the usual tropes but it works. You cannot go wrong with this movie if you enjoy Bollywood at all!,1519257600,,453,4.82051282051282
