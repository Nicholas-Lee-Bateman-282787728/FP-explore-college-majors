8047440,5,B0007GP7SC,"I really like this movie.  Every bull rider at heart is a cowboy,  Bo Derek announces as she hosts this intimate, and often heart-warming, inside look at a truly rare breed of men.  They are both athletes and cowboys, competing in one of the most extreme and brutal of all sports, professional bull riding.  From the rookies struggling to make it through the challenger ranks, all the way to some of the biggest stars of the sport competing on the PBR Cup Tour, Adrenaline Cowboys is an in-depth look into the heart's and mind's of men who have the courage to chase their dreams no matter what the cost.  Featuring personal stories and behind-the-scenes footage along with some of the most bone-crushing extreme ride entertainment ever - guaranteed to take you into the arena and straight to the heart of the action.",1109721600,,816,4.71830985915493
