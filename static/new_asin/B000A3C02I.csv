8073881,5,B000A3C02I,"Quentin Tarantino's fans - this one is 4u! Gangster movie with raw power and breathtaking ferocity, Russian style with sarcastic flavor, newly born genre of ridicule targeting crime and criminals. Too bad this movie does not have English subtitles...",1156896000,2,250,5.435897435897436
8073882,5,B000A3C02I,"This movie is on par with Goodfellas and Pulp Fiction, only with the Russian flavor. Lots of black humor and totally unreal scenes involving scores of revolting characters that leave no chance to those who insist that Russia is a civilized society. The language is totally funny without being centered on minute nuances and should be almost just as funny in translation.

Recommend to ya all, keep the kids away!",1146700800,,412,4.885714285714286
