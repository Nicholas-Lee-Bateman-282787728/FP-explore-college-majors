8204132,5,B000S2XCZA,Fun movie for younger kids. We parents enjoyed it too. But it is kind of corny and geared more for younger kids.  It's not as high quality movie making as say Diary of a Wimpy Kid for example.,1498003200,,192,4.052631578947368
8204133,5,B000S2XCZA,This movie is very good and is well-acted even though this premise has been done before in other movies. The characters are believable and the movie was very enjoyable.,1442793600,,168,4.827586206896552

8204135,5,B000S2XCZA,"I really love this movie! so many people said this is a repetitive, annoying movie that only kids will like. Well, I do NOT agree with that at all. Yes it is repetitive, but it gets funnier every time. It's not like they do the same exact things over and over again. It has the same base every time, but after the second time, luke notices he's living the same day over again. So it changes a little each time.",1311206400,,410,4.1375
8204136,3,B000S2XCZA,"This enjoyable, fun movie ended up being one of my favorite movies aimed at the tween crowd.  The pace of the movie is very good, the main character is very engaging, and the situations seem pretty age-appropriate and realistic (given the movie's premise) and handled with a good helping of humor and fun.  The 11-year old protagonist experiences bullies, skateboard gods, dealing with a teacher as a human being, an antagonistic older sister, coming to grips with feelings toward a girl in his class, and most important: facing things he's afraid of.

  The movie borrows its premise from the movie ""Groundhog Day"" where the protagonist finds himself waking again and again to the morning of the same day, but for everyone else, the day has never happened before.  In ""Groundhog Day"", a jaded newscaster is forced to relive his least favorite day over and over until he learns humility and caring.  In this movie, a boy anxious about starting middle school wishes that the Last Day of Summer would never end - and he gets his wish; the day continues to repeat until he learns some valuable lessons about friendship and how to deal with things that he's afraid to face.

  The movie is humorous, sometimes a bit over the top, but always good fun.  Unlike one reviewer, I didn't find the movie too long; I was always curious to see what the protagonist would try next.  I don't think it's up there with the great movies of all time, but it's definitely a good one and worth a look.",1298592000,,1480,4.65
8204137,5,B000S2XCZA,"Your kids will love this one. It's a fun movie and maybe you will even watch it with them! The main boy is adorable and his friends are pretty funny. For a Nickelodeon movie, this one is a gem.",1294012800,,193,3.9743589743589745
8204138,3,B000S2XCZA,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Day-of-Summer/dp/B000S2XCZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Day of Summer</a>&nbsp;the last days of summer was wonderful. the idea of suspending time so the same day is repeated over and over again is a very imaginative idea.  however, what brings this movie down is that  the filmmakers did not know when to call it quits.  after a while watching the same events being repeated over and over again just begins to wear one out.  what this movie needed to be was twenty minutes shorter.  they could have told the same story in less time, then it would have been far less tedious to watch.",1268352000,,670,5.594059405940594
8204139,5,B000S2XCZA,"This is a really fun family movie.  I especially liked the character ""MEAT"" played by Daniel Samonas!  I am sure we will be seeing more of him in the future...",1196208000,,159,4.266666666666667
