The pyro is stunning and the light show of of this world. Till has the main focus of the show  (as always), but you actually get a look at everybody else as well. I have  watched the video countless times since I got it and have not grown tired  of it. The Bueck Dich scene is as always funny, but could be onffensive to  some people. I showed it to several of my freinds and they are all buying  it. The video just rules.",939772800,3,551,3.9727272727272727

1244860,5,B00000K501,"Grrrrr...When you attend or watch a Rammstein show, you have to take it as a total package.  Buck Dich and all.  A rammstein live show is a theatrical experience, made more so by the fact that they don't really pause between  songs, there's no political diatribe or ""Hello Berlin Are you ready to  rock"" crap.  They come out, assume their characters and play.  Buck  Dich is one of the most fascinating parts of the show, and it must be  experienced.",937267200,,450,4.5375

Rammstein's music is amazing by itself, but listening to Rammstein and watching their insane stage show together is outstanding! Till Lindemann (vocals), Richard Kruspe (lead guitar), Paul Landers (rhythm guitar), Oliver Riedel (bass guitar), Christoph Schneider (drums) and Christian Lorenz (keyboards and synthesizers) are extremely talented musicians, combine that talent with a stage show that included smoke, fire, explosions and much more, and you have a performance that cannot be beat!

1244919,5,B00000K501,"Live Aus Berlin is an amazing concert to have by Rammstein. If you live in the U.S. though I'm warning you now, the best song in the whole concert was removed because the US Government is so strict on shit like that they had it removed on US copies. Buck Dich was removed. So if you want to see the whole concert WITH Buck Dich on it, you gotta get the VHS copy.

Why Buck Dich was Removed:
In 1998, Till Lindemann (Rammstein's vocalist) and Flake Lorenz (keyboardist) performed the Buck Dich act in Worcester, Massachusetts. The performance led to the two being arrested, hence why Rammstein never came back to the US after. Both were fined $200 and spent the night in jail.

I say its ridiculous. You can also find the performance (Live Aus Berlin version) on YouTube. Just search ""Rammstein Buck Dich Live Aus Berlin""",1377475200,3,820,4.533783783783784

1244921,2,B00000K501,"Rammstein is arguably the greatest live concert experience on the planet.  The band's performances here are awesome indeed...but having said that:

Regarding this video release (recorded over two nights in Berlin), the split-second cutting between the cameras is INTENSELY irritating, to the point of being unwatchable.

C'mon, folks....let us SEE the performance without sending us into an epileptic fit! Is it really THAT terrible to linger 6 or 8 seconds on a single camera shot?!?

A CLASSIC example of why I actually prefer audience-recorded videos posted on YouTube to the official releases. The audio of the audience recordings is often poor, but at least I can watch the performance without going into seizures!

I have the same complaint with most of the official concert video releases of many of my favorite artists....Paul McCartney and The Rolling Stones included.  The ""strobe-light"" effect of the camera changes is IMMENSELY disconcerting.  Get your act together, people!!",1372550400,,987,5.411764705882353

Unfortunately, my husband is dying and my son has a form of Autism so we won't be going home to see any concerts anytime soon. I was told this was the next best thing to being there. NO.

Why is Bck Dich taken off the DVD? It's fishy! If the government or record label demanded it be
removed from the recording on DVD after the VHS was released why then does it read, ""Uncensored Version""
on the VHS tape? Also shouldn't the Parental Advisory Explicit Content label be removed from the DVD
with no Bck Dich? I'm sure it's only a marketing strategy and there's nothing wrong with that but there!

1244965,2,B00000K501,"I'm just going to get straight to the point and say that if you want a live Rammstein CD or DVD you should definitely pick up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volkerball-Special-Edition/dp/B000JLPMEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volkerball (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;instead of this. The problem with Live Aus Berlin doesn't lie so much in the performance, it's just the quality of the filming and the audio is beyond terrible.
First off, the video looks like a bad VHS recording (faded milky look and all) and the camera rarely focuses on anything for more than a moment making it almost unwatchable. The audio might be even worse than the video, I'm not sure how they recorded the audio for this performance, but it certainly isn't a soundboard recording. For whatever reason Till occasionally sings in a very low voice at live shows and that, combined with whatever method they used to record the audio makes it nearly impossible make out a lot of the vocals. In the DVD's defense, Live Aus Berlin was released in 1998 and the DVD format was still pretty new so perhaps that excuses its problems, but if you're watching with today's eyes and ears you're more than likely going to be disappointed.",1270512000,4,1239,5.326530612244898

I consider these my old millenium and new millenium Rammstein show disks.  This disk has a wonderful show intro, with the boys appearing in poofs of spotlight.  Then Flake strikes a keyboard motive and Till descends to the stage in a shower of sparks.  The song Spiel is started.  The boys are in silvery makeup, lending eerie backdrop to the onstage fireworks.  There is a lot to love in this concert: the firebrands held on the stage set during the song ""Wilder Wein"", fabulous-looking Bobolina in the cage for the song ""Engel"".  Finally, the closing and extro with the song ""Seeman"", while keyboardist Flake sails the mighty mosh pit.  And I must not fail to mention: fireworks, flamethrowers, synchronized searchlights.  It looked like one great evening in a park in Berlin.",1237852800,,926,4.695652173913044

Members of RAMMSTEIN could PLAY first and then got together to become the definitive HARD ROCK GODS of the 20th century!  This is the best live show I've ever witnessed.

1244994,5,B00000K501,"So basically totally opposite of 99% of the bands out there today. If you don't like Rammstein your scared of reality.

 There is no harder working band in music today, they push through the weight of the crowd unlike any other band in recent memory.

 Of course when you have that kind of strength to transform your audience you are lifting up rocks underneath which the sun hasn't shined for a very long time. This explains a lot of the strong themes of their music, they see things in the audience they don't even see in themselves.

 The theatrics of the band add a lot to the show, some of it is the band just having a bit of fun but a lot of it contains symbolism and meaning.

 Also despite their reputation for being insane, profane, and antisocial a lot of their music is in fact very touching and emotional.",1161648000,3,817,4.364238410596027

Three, Bck Dich ('bend over') is NOT on the DVD version, regardless of the censorship.  So if you are looking for that live performance, you need to purchase the VHS version of Live Aus Berlin.  Also, don't even look at the main review, because it's obviously a one-sided opinion made by someone with no taste for this type of music.  Look at the customer reviews, which are written by people who appreciate the music.  Having the DVD reviewed by someone who doesn't like the music is like having the KKK commenting on the Family Matters sitcom; it's not happening.

As for what I think, if you like Rammstein, you need this.  Period.  I have shown people who were saying ""I hate Rammstein, they suck, they have no talent"" and have had them say to me ""Holy crap, that's got to be the best live show I've ever seen anyone perform.""

I've watched this DVD multiple times, and I have to say that this is an exceptional concert. The band has great energy, Flake does a dance, and Till does somersaults in boots that shoot sparks. On the ending track, Seemann, Flake gets an inflatable boat and crowd-surfs on it. They didn't play a few songs I wanted them to play (Der Meister, Eifersucht), but overall it's an amazing show.",1159660800,,534,4.8791208791208796
1244997,5,B00000K501,"This requires a bit of a German lesson to fully understand.

The verb 'haben' mean 'to have' in German and the verb 'hassen' means 'to hate.'

Germans conjugate their verbs by changing the endings.

We do this in English as well. Take the verb be: I am, he is, we are. Or have: I have, he has, we have.

The way you conjugate haben for you have would be du hast.

For you hate it would be du hasst.

Since du hasst and du hast sound the same, and even though the lyrics say du hast, up until Till says ""du hast mich gefragt"" (you have asked me) it could be either one. This gives the song a double meaning.",1146960000,6,606,4.008333333333334

If you want to be entertained, watch a great show and not try to ""guess""  or debate or assume what they're saying this is deffinately for you, it has everything you would never see in this country,the band gives 100% into their performance and the enthusiasm and feedback from the crowd is something not to be missed.

The pyrotechnics are wild. For one song, the lead singer is on fire. For another, he's spewing flames from a flame thrower over the audience. But, Rammstein is so much more than pyrotechnics and theatrics. They can play. Rammstein keeps their audience in a frenzy for the entire show.

They growl and sing. They pound and play their instruments. There's passion and anger. I was blown away. They put a lot of American super groups to absolute shame.

The DVD itself is well produced. The audio quality is excellent. The visuals give the viewer an beautiful perspective on how massive a Rammstein show is. It's incredible. I sh-- you not. This DVD is worth every penny and then some.

1245001,5,B00000K501,"This is a great DVD that is very entertaining and without a dull moment. I don't like to watch concert footage because they are boring and the music usually doesn't sound as good but this is Rammstein and they know how to put on a show. They are playing to a soldout stadium in Berlin. The audience is consevative looking and the age group is mixed which is interesting to see because Rammstein is an industrial metal band. If this was in America the audience would be smaller and they would all be young and wouldn't understand what they were saying. The band members are in costume and have silver stuff in their hair which you don't see too much from rock bands who usually go on in a t-shirt and a pair of jeans. The pyrothectics rage from sparks coming out of boots, drum sticks, a bow and arrow also microphone stands and the singer are on fire and the singer shooting a flamethrower over the audience. It also has some humor to it like when the very skinny keyboardist tries to dance and the singer thrusting his hips and when he wheels himself around  during the song Heirate Mich. Sometimes the keyboards are little bit louder than the guitars but I didn't  mind it because it gave it a different sound. The song Wilder Wein is much better here than the studio version because it isn't as long and the accoustic guitars and violin give it a nice touch. There is also an interview at the end with subtitles for those who don't know german.
Now for the things that weren't that good. They show the same clips of the audience members over and over, some of the parts are slowed for a second and when the singer slams a microphone stand on stage they show it from different angles. The reason I didn't like all that was because it took away from the live feeling but it's easily ignorable. I find myself watching this DVD all the time and it never seems to get old and watching this DVD will either make you a fan or a bigger fan of Rammstein like me.",1127865600,8,1956,4.341530054644808

When you know Rammstein better from some Interviews, you will see, that they make a show when they stand on the stage but in real life they are very funny guys and worlds apart of their life on stage. I love their music and that they have a very good sense of sarcasm and irony. In the music and on stage they create their own world - the dark cornors of life.

And know to the translations:

Du hast can mean both you hate and you have. It's the same word in german and so even germans doesn't know, what is meant.

1245004,5,B00000K501,"Sam Sutherland's mistakes are inexcusable for a professional critic. As another reviewer pointed out,Mr. Sutherland's translations are incorrect and distort the meaning of the songs. In addition,there is no ""forcible rape""in the video. There is a rather campy scene of simulated consentual S&M anal sex. Till wears an obviously fake exaggerated rubber dildo that spews liquid around the stage and over himself. The scene is definitely played for laughs.
Is this suitable for children? No. But it is not meant for children. It is meant for teens and other adults.
I am a 54 year old grandmother who NEVER watches anything with sadistic sex or sadistic violence of any kind, and I am VERY strict about following age/content guidelines with children.
That said,this video is just incredibly good. The music is first rate and the stage performance is electrifying. This is the best performance I have ever seen and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates great music and superlative theater. You will not be disappointed.
I envy anyone who has ever seen Rammstein live, but at least we fans are fortunate that this video is available.

1245005,5,B00000K501,"Okay, I was hung-ho to purchase the CD version until I read the amazon review about the difference between the CD and the original VHS tape - they had cut out Buck Dich from the CD version because of an alleged SM Homosexual Rape scene that did not please our 'higher society' Decency Patrol who determines what we sheepish tax-paying citizens should view and not view, the puritanical and un-adulterated delicate flower pedals that we are. As a Rammstein fan, and an educated adult not stranded in church, naturally curiosity got the better of me and I had to buy the VHS tape instead and witness the aweful rudeness for myself. I don't like being jipped of my hard-earned money either, so the tape was the accurate option for me anyway. Well... I'll be damned! Cursed be oh gaga thee, what moron deemed that particular spectacle a horrid rape scene to be banished from society is truly an idiot and should cancel their HBO subscription, head for the hills right away and hang his/herself from the tallest tree. Because if that scene made 'em reach for their good book, wait til they see what's on ordinary TV next season. Get a grip people. It is a spectacle alright, and I laughed myself silly when the scene came up, but it's nothing of the sort of a ""rape"" scene (I'll even admit I was a tad wee dissappointed there wasn't more to it from all the hipe than the 30 some seconds of mere sexual 'gesture'). I knew there wouldn't be anything harsh to it already, even German audiences (who are apparently ions more open-minded than our government gives us credit for) have their limits and Rammstein is no fools, they're not going to alienate their diverse audience with truly crude stuff. This ain't porn after all. Rammstein is known for their spectacular shows, and unlike most bands they're not afraid to venture beyond mere love and loss themes in their songs, duh. But that's the beauty of Rammstein, and it's not like they gear their shows, or their music for that matter, for the lite-hearted. They're geared for us, the rest of the vast population of adults who have been around the block, and those who haven't yet but are clearly geared to no matter what anybody says. If you intend to pamper us in 'decency', then stop showing Sadam in his underwear already and put Jerry F back on prime time to show us the righteous way to salvation!!! In my opinion, their playful and non-threatening momentary stage venture into the world of Gay SM sex (which is no more depraved than anything heteros reckon doing on HBO on a nightly basis), and no penetration involved blessed be between the lead with a plastic dildo spewing vast amounts of white liquid throughout the audience as well and the keyboardist on a leash and his pretty little glutus maximus exposed briefly (hey, the audience cheered on, they were not offended), is a play in comedy and hardly a reason to omit Buck Dich, which they executed as beautifully musically as the rest of their performance here and to omit it takes away from the entire performance. Shame on the decency patrol who denied this segment from the CD version, and to save whom from stumbling down the path of sadomasochistic depravity and shooting up a McDonalds? I mean, really folks. What a joke. Even if you're offended by minutely sexual displays, and if you are do cancel your Showtime subscription as well, forget buying the CD version - act on your freedom (and morbid curiosity) to choose what you do and watch and go for the VHS full version, you won't be sorry. Even if you don't like this particular display of comedy, the tape is already a collector's item and will one day be entirely unavailable but to those who can afford paying a hefty price.",1116806400,9,3698,4.63013698630137

1245009,4,B00000K501,"As other reviewers have stated, the Amazon review has INCORRECT translations of German.  ""You hate"" is NOT spelled ""Du Hast"" but rather ""Du hasst"" (or hat).  ""Heirate Mich"" means ""marry me"", not ""worship me"".  Anyone in a beginner's German course could translate the lyrics and understand the context, or barring that, use some minor effort to look up English translations of the songs on the internet.  Not only that, but the Amazon review focuses on rather old news of controversy rather than the merits of the music and performances.  The current Amazon review is not only dated, but seems to attempt to associate Rammstein's leanings with that of the Columbine killers.  Anyone familiar with R.'s music and interviews would know that they are quite ""Left"".  The Amazon review doesn't tell potential buyers enough about the Rammstein DVD, but it does rather illuminate the ignorance of that particular author.  Amazon needs to replace that review with something more apropos.  Considering the number of folks who have called Amazon on these errors, why hasn't the review been updated?  Shame on you, Amazon.com!

Oh BTW, I did very much enjoy the DVD.  However, I would recommend the Lichtspielhaus DVD as far superior.  I'd never even heard of Rammstein until a friend told me about them and loaned me the DVDs.  Sure, they're not everyone's cup of tea, but don't let phrases like ""industrial metal"" (or whatever lame label people use) scare you off.  I generally do NOT like ""metal"", but these guys are something else!  It's very richly textured music, very distinctive, thematic (and sometimes near-Operatic) and I also think the lyrics are worth the effort to understand.

1245010,5,B00000K501,"This is a fantastic concert with one caveat.  The DVD release omits the song ""Bueck Dich"" in its entirety because of some pseudo sexual antics the band engaged in onstage.  What was the logic here?  It already existed on the VHS version of the tape, but the U.S. release of the DVD it was censored/edited out.  Why?  The DVD already bears the ""Parental Advisory"" label, so what the heck?  It's a little disconcerting to me that that no mention of or warning is given of number(s) taken out, so you may (I did) feel a little shortchanged of the full concert.

Having said that, what we do get on the DVD is nothing short of spectacular with Deutschland's ber band putting on a show that rivals easily the very best super stadium productions here in America.  Rammstein does it with more flair and theatricality than anyone - and their pyrotechnics are the best in the business.  What lead singer other than Till Lindemann can make an entrance completely engulfed in flames?  The show is spectacular and the audience goes nuts, singing along through this great, great night.

1245011,5,B00000K501,"I remember when my copy of LaB DVD first came in...I had chills, I couldn't WAIT to get it in my DVD player and on my screen.  My anticipation was amply rewarded.  From first song to last, each one was far more intricate and beautiful than their 2-D album versions.  You could tell the band was giving 1000% of themselves in every note they played, especially rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, who was so sick with flu during the recording of this DVD that he had to be iced down between songs to bring down his raging fever.

I was especially blown away by the live version of Wilder Wein.  The original, demo version I'd previously heard was tinny, and was all synth and lead singer Till Lindemann.  Nevertheless beautiful, but made breathtaking when the three guitarists (the previously mentioned Landers, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, and bassist Oliver Reidel) joined in on accoustic guitars.  Gorgeous.  Even with sombreros...

This DVD is a MUST HAVE for any Rammstein fan.  To not own it, is like a Christian without a Bible, pointless.

And the extras are unbelieveable!  I especially liked the alternate camera angles option.  To watch my favorite member, up close, through a whole song, without cutting to the others?  GLEE.

In closing, I'd like to make a quick commentary on Amazon's review.  I am deeply disappointed.  I would think a site as well-established as yours would do your reasearch before so grossly mistranslating their song titles.  For shame.

My listening experiences have ranged from the San Francisco sound, to progressive/art rock, to fusion jazz, to bluegrass/finger-style guitar, with a little classical and symphony thrown in.  Let's not forget Trans-Siberian Orchestra.  I actually play classical guitar.  When I first heard Rammstein on the radio (Du Hast), I thought it was Megadeth singing in German.  When I saw the opening segment in the movie ""XXX,"" I couldn't believe it.  I decided I needed more ""footage."" I ordered Live Aus Berlin on DVD, and can't quit watching it.  From the ""space-men"" intro, to the final note, it just totally blows me away.  My effort to categorize it fails, but images of Kiss, Devo, Ozzy, Kraftwerk, and Sparks all materialize, though nothing nails it.  It is way over-the-top.  What impresses me nearly as much as the performance is the audience.  My image of a Rammstein concert in the US would be attended by gothic, punk, or broom-headed mohawk types, which in total may fill a small theater.  When the ""Live"" camera view panned the stadium, revealing the huge Berlin audience, there were high-schoolers, working stiffs, war vets, real people, even over-50s like me.  This would be a Bruce Springsteen audience in the States.  What this tells me is that music like this is ""mainstream"" in Germany.  If this is indeed the case, about Germany and the music they embrace, then surely these are my people!  I'm really tempted to book a flight right now to see a live show...

The dvd contains 17 tracks from their albums Herzeleid and Sehnsucht(done live)and the extra features you get the concert with german subtitles and you get a multicamera mode for the 3 songs Tier, Du Hast and Rammstein. With the multicamera mode you get a choice of 6 angles which lets you decide what you would like to mostly see e.g. directors cut, guitars, drums, bass and keys, wides and vocals. Another extra feature you get is a 14:30 interview with the band. The interview allows you to have a choice of subtitles including English, Spanish and French, and if your computer can read dvd's you can insert this dvd and you view a rammstein trivia fan contest containing 140 questions.
The performance was great. Rammstein perform with a great deal of colourful lights and mist and there is a great use of fire at the concert. The dvd lets you see all the action including the violence and as a special treat for the fans, rammstein use explosives, flame throwers, flaming arrows and fireworks and the main highlights of the dvd are the tracks Rammstein were Till Lindeman(singer) performs on fire(using safety clothesing) and another highlight is Engel were the guitarists daughter plays as the girl in the cage with fire. My favourite performance is Du Riechst So Gut were Till Lindeman(singer) shoots flaming arrows at the beginning of the song. Another great thing about the performance is that Till Lindeman(singer) didn't just stand there and sing, he sang while acting like that people can understand the message he is trying to get across.
The crowd is good aswell, they are very loud. They jump up and down or nod their heads for most of the time and they join in on the choruses and before and after every song they show their respect by clapping or whistling, so if you like metal dvd's with big crowds then this is for you.
The subject of the songs are mainly about various types of love(even says in interview) and there are a few songs about religion. The disturbing songs about love include Du Riechst So Gut which talks about stalking and Spiel Mit Mir talking about gay love(in an explicit way which is why its bad). Ok, now onto the the nondisturbing songs about love. The nondisturbing songs about love include Wilder Wein which is about love including a bottle of whine. The songs about religion include the song Engel and Asche Zu Asche and yes Rammstein do include violence in some songs including Weisses Fleisch which is just about mindless violence, so if you have a faint heart and are thinking about getting this, i suggest you not look at the lyrics translated which may put you off.
Ok, i've basically told you a fair bit about the dvd, so now i shall chucck in some reminders. The song Bueck Dich is censored from the dvd seeming people thought not only the lyrics but the performance was explicit, though in my opinion i though the performance was silly and in the dvd there is a hidden track called stripped, i havn't tried it, but i hear you press 23 at main menu and you then press enter. Overall thankyou for your time reading this review. I hope it gave you more of an idea of the dvd and hopefully you may buy it.",1057536000,26,3348,4.56312292358804

1245044,5,B00000K501,"Because I live in a place where concerts, especially those by European bands, are virtually impossible-- I had never seen Rammstein actually performing before I watched this video.  I have no cable, and I have no MTV.  At this point, I have been able to acquire music videos...but Live aus Berlin was my first experience beyond a CD.  And I think that I fell in love the night that I watched it.
Rammstein is a lot of things, but one thing they are not is boring.  It is a great shame that a lot of American music fans cannot appreciate this video because the intelligent lyrics are lost on those who do not understand them.  The music is good-- yes-- but not surpassingly so.  It is indeed moving and deep, but it's the lyrics, the fact that much of them are in archaic languages and rife with allusions to great poetry and culture; and, of course, the intensity with which they are performed that makes Rammstein truly great.
Firstly, I do not find them at all offensive.  Even their sexual antics on stage are silly at worst, not upsetting, and they generally are amusing and witty.  The lyrics don't strike me as unpleasent.  Yes, they sing about unusual themes that are not generally accepted by the fragile norm.  People don't like to be rattled into thinking a little harder.  People don't like the suggestion that aesthetics can also lie in what they themselves find disturbing; like pain, fire, and yes, even death.  But we all need a little disturbing.  We have grown too static in our thinking.  Our only disturbances are typically of the annoying-- yowling bands that spit youthful anger and hate at us-- not deep, macabre suffering tinged with irony and dark humour.  Sometimes what is misunderstood about Rammstein is that a lot of Rammstein's songs are sarcastic social commentaries; not personal opinions.  Weies Fleisch is not promoting rape or assault-- it's expressing the horror of such mindless violence.  After all, the mere mention of it in a song unnerves people!  The problem is, so much time is wasted in attacking Rammstein for daring mention what people don't want think about on their own...that time could be spent in doing something about the very real issues of violence, rape, and racism.  It doesn't go away if you ignore it.
Rammstein claims to want to cause a little trouble, but I don't think that that explains everything about them.  My own mother (yes, I'm one of the restless 17's) dislikes them because she finds them frightening.  But fire is an expression not just of destruction, but of passion; and also of love.  It is the raging of unstoppable, immense emotion-- like the sun, it can warm the heart or it can burn down to the bone.
And I am not comparing Rammstein only to the other goth bands and rock bands and metal bands of this era, but also to the bombastic glory of Beethoven, the youthful madness of Wolfgang Mozart; and even to the melancholy operas of Verdi.  All these things are not Rammstein-- but Rammstein do share one thing with the masters of music:  majesty.",1042416000,53,3024,4.683712121212121

Unfortunatly, I had just purchased the greatest live dvd in the history of music: And All That Could Have Been, by Nine Inch Nails.

1245051,5,B00000K501,"Live Aus Berlin (LAB for short) is by far the best live show I have ever seen.  Rammstein fans will not be disappointed.  If you have seen the beginning of the film XXX, then you have witnessed a sampling of a Rammstein performance.  Rammstein performs with pyrotechnics like a Kiss concert times ten, costuming on par with Gwar, and lights and set right out of musical theater.  Yet, for all this, Rammstein is distinctly German. The songs are taken from Sehnsucht and Herzeleid, but the highlight of the show is a stunning performance of the single, Wilder Wein.  During this beuatiful ballad, all three guitarist step onstage dressed in oversized sombreros as each strums the haunting melody as a kind of mariachi band.  It is unlike anything I have ever seen, both humorous and eerie.  The only downside is that the vesion I own had the song Buch Dich (Bend Over) cut from the show.  However, an extensive interview with scenes from Ramstein's videos and other live performances made up for this minor setback.  All in all, I highly reccommend this DVD for any fan of Industrial/Heavy Metal music.  Rammstein shows their appreciation for their fans by putting on one helluva show.",1028937600,2,1184,4.816831683168317
1245062,5,B00000K501,"I have been a huge fan of Rammstein (And Megaherz, they deserve mentioning, if you like Rammstein check them out) since the album Sehnsucht came out.  Ever since i first heard their music i was blown away by the sheer power of it.  I bought the VHS of Live Aus Berlin when it came out and their visual performance is appropriate for the music which contains such a roller-coaster ride of mixed emotions.  The DVD is even better than the VHS of course because everyone knows the quality is higher but the added bonus features are very nice too.
  I don't however see why they had to censor Buck Dich, it was a comical gag and was not meant to be taken seriously.  I mean they preformed it that way live in Europe and never had and problems as far as people complaining about it being ""dirty and homosexual""  but when they preform it in USA they get arrested for it,  and the song gets edited from the DVD but its still on the vhs?  .  How pointless is that, i mean if you don't want to see it you can just push a button and then - WOW - you are on the next song.
  But aside from that it is still a worth while purchase if you like Rammstein even the slightest.  However, the ""Official amazon review"" that is at the beginning of this page is, in a word - pathetic.  I mean of the 2 song titles the guy tried to translate he got neither of them right.  ""Du Hast"" means ""You Have"" NOT ""You Hate"", and ""Heirate Mich"" means ""Marry Me"" How could anyone mistake that for ""Worship Me""? (obviously no research was done for this article).  So since the reviewer didn't know exactly what they are saying he just assumed for the worst, and made their lyrics sound even more fitting to his relating of Rammstein to the little angry kids at Columbine and Nazis.

The video available from Amazon is the censored version, this annoyed me because I had no idea that there was an uncensored version. Apparently the censors don't like the stage show for Buch Dich. This is a real shame because it is one of the (many) highlights of the show!!!
Buy this DVD at all cost's Rammstein may never tour again and everyone who has ever heard their music and liked it should see them live.

That's easy.  If you listen to a band more than once, it's good.  If you listen to them more than ten times, twenty, thirty, etc...it is just that much better.
  With Rammstein, you get just that.  It's funny, how can a band be so popular in the United States, when more than half of the people that like it don't understand what their saying.  It's funny that this is so, but that's the world for you.  Rammstein is not one of my favorite bands, but every time I listen to them, I get a feeling of adrenaline.  I do understand some German, and I get what they are trying to say, but that's not why I listen to them.  I listen to them becasue I like them.  Just that simple.
  This DVD makes me want to see them in Concert Live!  I bought this from Amazon.com for a friend as a Christmas gift.  He let me watch it with him, and now I wish I had bought it for myself.  I might just do that.
  It's hard to say anything else on this, but i suggest that you buy this, or buy this for someone who enjoys Rammstein.  If you buy this as a gift, you will be one of their favorite friends or relatives for a while to come.",1008374400,3,1292,3.96875

Trying to protect our children who see enough crap anyways, at the expense of the die hard fan who really wanted to see Flake and Till...The sound was very good, and I basically have Live aus Berlin on daily. I love the fact that I can watch Richard the whole time during Du Hast and Tier, but what's up with sticking footage from different songs in there????? Oh well. I was satisfied with having the interview; Richard is quite passionate and expressive and the interview as a whole really clears up any misconceptions people may have about the guys. You technically can't misunderstand them, really, if you listen and give the time of day....Buy if u are lazy and prefer being able to skip songs, or if u want the interview, buy the dvd.

(...) There is no naziism in rammstein's work at all. 'Du Hast' means 'You Have' and Heirate Mich means 'Marry Me', quite a sharp contrast to the review's 'You Hate' and 'Worship Me'. In no song do rammstein touch upon the concept of naziism or any other political point for that matter.

From the opener, 'Spielt Mit Mir' to the closing 'Seemann', Live Aus Berlin is packed with footage from Rammstein's stop in Berlin in August of 1999. This DVD catches all of the violence, the emotion, and the fire of Rammstein. Unfortunately, the DVD version cuts Buck Dich out, but the extras and improved picture and sound quality make the DVD the overall better purchase. Rammstein uses a lot of stage theatrics, from costumes, to flamethrowers, fireworks, and slick lighting, to make the show more exciting for the audience. Till Lindemann even sets himself on fire (wearing a special suit, of course) during the song, 'Rammstein.' I don't know what's cooler than that? Their musicianship is tight and top-notch as ever, just as good live as in the studio. The extras include an interview with the whole band, as well as multi-angle views of 'Tier', 'Du Hast', and 'Rammstein'. If you're a Rammstein fan, this is an essential to own, a real Rammstein fan would be hard-pressed not to have this in his or her collection. It's a much better buy, in my opinion, than the 'Live Aus Berlin' CD, the visuals are half of Rammstein's show. Available on VHS and DVD.",999302400,7,1231,4.757009345794392

As an avid concert/music fan, i have to say that while being unfortunate in that ive never seen them live, this dvd has made sure ill catch them on their next tour. The show is a performance in itself with the pyrotechnics like youve never seen before(scenes include rockets shot into the air, Till setting himself on fire, flamethrowers, huge spotlights, an industrial metal fan)....and all of this is done without making the show.....cheesey.
The music is pure Rammstein, Heavy, Raw with a techno beat to keep you firmly planted in the new millenium. Unlike hair metal bands of the 80's and 90's, rammstein supasses the ministry's and NIN's of the world by giving us more raw, heavy guitar riffs which take me back to the sabbath of yesteryear. I was surprsied that the audio was as good as it was as a lot of concert dvds and videos lack a clear sound but this was like listening to them on a record. Make sure youhave surround sound and watch this in the dark for full effects. The extra features were cool with interviews of the band and the songs with subtitles in german....although an english feature wouldve been nice too.

There aren't many bands out there these days who put as much into their shows as these guys.  Their concert is more of an experience rather than just seeing some band jam.  I would really love to see them in person.  Oh yeah, they sound just as good (if not better) live as they do in the studio.  If you get a chance, pick up the cd.  It will not dissapoint.

Anyways, there's a few problems  with shimmer and artifacting, but who really cares?  This is mostly about  the sound.  In fact, who cares when you get Rammstein in a nice widescreen  format and dolby digital 5.1.  Hell you can even turn on the German  subtitles!  Video = A-
Bonus:  Alright.  Bonus material.  You get a 15  minute interview with the band and you can watch it with subtitles in  english, french or spanish.  There's even a hidden video  (""Stripped"" from the Depeche Mode tribute album) that you get as  a bonus when you solve all of the triva on the DVD-ROM portion... oh yea..  the DVD-ROM portion that everyone seems to be forgetting about.
This is  also NOT a single layer disc as mentioned in another review.  In order to  attain the 9GB of data that's on this disc, it's a specially made  dual-layer single-sided DVD.  Similar technology was used on stephen king's  ""the Stand"" to fit on one DVD (18GB dual-layered, double-sided)

1245115,5,B00000K501,"Considering everything you get - 17 tracks of live music (3 with 5 additional camera angles to choose from), 14:30 of interviews, 5.1 Dolby Digital sound (the Amazon info doesn't say it's there, but it is), and an  additional hidden track for the controversial ""Stripped"" video  (as previously mentioned here, hit 23, then Enter on your remote at the  main menu) - fans of Rammstein can't afford not to have this DVD.
The  ""Buch Dich"" track has been edited out of the DVD version, but  this is not a censored DVD; it's just the only one available, at least in  Region 1 NTSC format. The only way to see ""Buch Dich"" is by  picking up the VHS tape. If you're trying to decide between the two  formats, I'd say the DVD is tops, hands down. I have both, and since I've  gotten the DVD I haven't picked up the VHS even once. The video and audio  are superior to that of the VHS, and the VHS doesn't have any of the  additional features you can find on the DVD.
Speaking of video and audio,  they're both pretty good, but not great. There's some minor artifacting in  the video due to the onstage smoke effects combined with the fact that this  is just a single layer disc. The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound seems to be a bit  lacking in bass (though the band never has been all that heavy on it) and  the rear channels mostly only play crowd noise. But again, this DVD is  definately the best way to enjoy a Rammstein concert, aside from actually  being there.",957484800,93,1449,4.343283582089552

1245120,5,B00000K501,"For the Longest time i have hoped for a radical change in musicand yearned for more inventive and original bands rather than themainstream Hip-Hop/Rap style/corporate junk of MTv(which decides to exclude certain styles/bands much like that of Rolling Stone magazine in the past).  Since i have searched for better ideals, my desire for grander music has reversed my outlook towards the 70s and to such bands like Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones,Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, or anything pertaining to classic rock.  Not until recently have i looked away from these bands and looked ahead at others.  From Garbage to Rammstein, i have found new hope in their musical prowess and that Hip-Hop won't ever be mainstream and will die out like disco.
For a band like Rammstein to become the scapegoat of a massacre like that of Columbine is absurd.  Rammstein didn't place demented thoughts in those boys mind's - besides how could they understand truthfully what the lyrics are about?  Rammsteins' music is in German.  Translations can lose their meaning.  For instance, ""Du Hast' is continually misinterpreted as ""You Hate"" which is a fallacy.  ""You have"" is a more exact translation Mr. Sutherland.  And to back up an above review, ""Heirate Mich"" doesnt mean ""worship Me"" and, however, means ""Marry Me"".  The association to the Third Reich Mr. Sutherland is an insult to Germans everywhere and is racial in some aspects.  Stereotyping Rammstein because they are German is very racial and unacceptable. If you don't like Rammstein Mr. Sutherland just say so rather than insulting them and the German people.
As for RAMMS+EIN's music, it is completely original and entertaining, which is the purpose of their ""Live Aus Berlin"" video release.  This video should be obtained by anyone who is a fan of Rammstein, regardless of what Sutherland has mentioned. If you would like to know more about Rammstein, go to their website the website is in English and German.  There you will find adequate translations to their music as well.  ENJOY!

I could watch it forever! Till Lindemann is a great  Singer and has a great stage performance, as does his Keyboardist and  Guitarists. All I can say about the Drummer is: Wow!  Of course, I cannot  comment about the movie without commenting on their performance during  ""Buck Dich"" At first I was a bit shocked by what they did, but  then I couldn't stop laughing about it. It was more funny that perverse. I  will be laughing about that for God knows how long. Overall, this was  great!  The whole show had me mesmerized as it held most of my friends on  my Reservation. RAMMSTEIN RULES!  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys  dance/heavy metal music in a very awesome language, German, and for those  who have an open-mind and can laugh.",949449600,8,906,4.412121212121212

However, in all fairness, there is one song missing from the DVD -  ""Bck Dich"" has been omitted.  This song is included on the  uncensored version of the VHS (USA release and Euro PAL format).  The  following is a summary of some of the special inclusions on the DVD  version:
Multi camera shots of the individual members of Rammstein for  the songs ""Tier"", ""Du Hast"" and ""Rammstein"".  An interview is included (translated sub-titles) with clips from all  Rammstein videos. A contest to challenge your Rammstein knowledge  (consisting of 140 questions) is playable from your CD-ROM using Windows.  As a bonus track, the entire video for ""Stripped"" is  included.
Convinced?  I hope so.  Because if you have never experienced  Rammstein Live - this is the next best thing to actually being there!",943315200,49,941,5.0855263157894735
