8421095,5,B004AXFPZS,"TCM and Universal did a great job on putting some great Douglas Sirk movies from the 50s. First of all, the quality of the movies is pretty good with a lot of bonus features on each movie. All movies do include an introduction by Robert Osborne which is like your watching the movie on TCM channel. Only ""Thunder on the Hill"" is in B&W and in Full frame format and the other three movies are in color and Widescreen.

-""Thunder on the Hill"" (1951)
Claudette Colbert, Ann Blyth, Robert Douglas, Anne Crawford and Gladys Cooper
-""Taza, Son of Cochise"" (1954)
Rock Hudson, Barbara Rush, Gregg Palmer, Bart Roberts and Morris Ankrum
-""Captain Lightfoot"" (1955)
Rock Hudson, Barbara Rush, Jeff Morrow, Kathleen Ryan and Finlay Currie
-""The Tarnished Angels"" (1958)
Rock Hudson, Robert Stack, Dorothy Malone, Jack Carson and Robert Middleton

Bonus features on each disk does vary, but the majority of the are usually the same thing, which are: movie posters, publicity stills, lobby cards, scene stills, behind the scene photos, TCMDb article, pressbook, publicity publications and Douglas Sirk bio. Overall this is a great collection to have and I would recommend this.",1366329600,5,1165,5.0310880829015545
8421096,3,B004AXFPZS,"This is a decent collection of Douglas Sirk's more minor works.  Don't generally expect these to be as good as ""Imitation of Life"" or ""All That Heaven Allows.""  I personally really love the movie ""The Tarnished Angels,"" which is similarly melodramatic and ironic, but these other works aren't much to write home about.  They're well directed, of course, but their pulse is somewhat lifeless.",1343433600,2,391,5.078125
8421097,5,B004AXFPZS,"Very nice collection. I'm glad that finally a few Douglas Sirk movies are available on DVD.
But when will ""Never Say Goodbye"" (1956, with Rock Hudson and Cornell Borchers) be available on DVD (not to be mixed up with the older 1946 version)?
This is a true little gem and one of my favorites, almost as good as ""All that Heaven allows"" and in any case much better than ""Magnificent Obsession"".
It's never on TCM and I check if it's available on DVD year after year, but so far in vain.",1296777600,9,485,4.34065934065934
