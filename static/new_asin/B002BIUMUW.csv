8361487,5,B002BIUMUW,"This is one of my favorite TV Series and this season is THE best. It is completely different yet tied in with the others. I LOVE it!

I special ordered this as a DVD set, after years of begging Jonathan M. Shiff to release it on DVD in the USA. I think he heard my e-mail pleas about introducing this show to the next generations. I have this season both on DVD as well as Amazon Video. The DVDs require an all regions player, and mine broke. As I love this season best of all I could not resist getting the Amazon Video set as well, till I get a new DVD player. I will be purchasing the first three seasons in the future as well.

This series has the Ocean, David Hoflin, a whale, aliens, pyramids, mysteries, did I mention David Hoflin, submarines, an island, wildlife, with hints at Stargate and possibly The X-Files (though I haven't seen much of the latter).

I like all of the regular cast. Marzena Godecki is wonderful as Neri. David Hoflin and Jeffrey Walker as Jason and Brett Bates are key elements since the beginning. Alex Pinder as Dr. Winston Seth has puns and words of wisdom, as usual. Tharini Mudaliar makes a good counterpart to Neri as Shersheba. And Lauren Hewett returns as Mera.",1486252800,,1200,4.396396396396397

8361493,5,B002BIUMUW,"Ocean Girl is imaginative and wholesome.  I am especially pleased to have it in my families collection. I would suggest others too, like Cybergirl, The Secret World of Alex Mac, and Wolf Blood.",1413504000,,193,4.848484848484849
