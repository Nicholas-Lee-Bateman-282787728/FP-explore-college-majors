8316691,4,B001KZVQ7K,"I am a fan of the History Channel's ""Automobiles"" series and this is one of those shows originally aired on that cable/satellite channel.

This DVD highlights the 1955 Chevrolet midsize cars that changed Detroit styling and performance. The video does a good job of setting the stage for the car's appearance on dealer showroom floors. It shows the viewer that Chevrolet was viewed as the economy or low-end automaker, low on style and performance. The leadership at GM felt that unless they could change that perception, they would lose to Ford in the present and future.

The car's styling was influenced by Cadillac and performance was enhanced by a new V-8, one that would power Chevrolets for decades to come - the small block Chevy V-8. The video does a very good job of showing that the increased affluence of Americans in the 50's led to the desire for more styling and performance under the hood. The video did a good job of showing how the cars evolved over several years as well as how Chevrolet used racing to boost interest in the new car.

On the whole, it's a good video. A couple things I didn't like: first, it's only 47 minutes long. Second (and worse), the price is simply too high for a 47 minute video. Not to worry. There are Amazon sellers (look under ""buying options"") who will sell you this video (both new and used) at a far lower price. I give this HC production four stars.",1295568000,,1401,4.573705179282869
