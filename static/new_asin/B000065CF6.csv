7960976,1,B000065CF6,"This was a truly horrid dvd.  I thought it would be entertaining to watch anything Victor Borge did, because of his gentle comedic genious, but this story-reading is awful and boring for kids and adults alike.  I really couldn't watch the whole thing.",1148428800,9,251,4.813953488372093
7960977,1,B000065CF6,"Even a die-hard Borge fan such as I, must wonder why Mr. Borge did this...very boring, very slow.
There is none of the classic Borge wit, or sparkle, which can brighten even the most drab of stories.
This DVD would be ideal for one purpose, and one purpose alone...the cure for insomnia...(with profound apologies, to the Master, Victor Borge).",1125878400,18,344,4.8474576271186445
