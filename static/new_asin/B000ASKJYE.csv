8447183,5,B000ASKJYE,"I saw ""Saigon, USA"" on my local PBS station some time ago, and just ordered the DVD.  It's a terrific documentary all about the town of Westminster, California near Los Angeles.  This is where many of the boat people and refugees from the Vietnam War chose to settle...  In this impressive profile, we see the progress made by these robust, tough people and learn about the inter-generational issues.  It's an especially poignant film for anyone who ever wondered what happened to the people who escaped the collapse of Saigon and the Killing Fields.  It also teaches some important lessons about integration or the lack thereof, in this ethnic enclave.  The plight of a Vietnamese-American video store owner, who wanted to display a picture of Ho Chi Mihn and was the subject of a mass-protest a couple years ago, is used as a lynchpin to reveal the complexity of feeling surrounding the Vietnamese government and Vietnam War.  It's alternately heartwarming, disturbing, moving, and incredibly interesting.  I strongly recommend it.",1124582400,7,1033,5.107142857142857
