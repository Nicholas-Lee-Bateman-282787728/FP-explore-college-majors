3513,3,0764004581,"BOTTOM LINE: IF you're a fan of big screen toughguy Lee Marvin, director John (DELIVERANCE) Boorman, or legendary Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, then you may enjoy this. The slipshod script is the real villain of this WWII-flavored take on THE DEFIANT ONES. If nothing else, the gorgeous South Seas location scenery is worth gawking at. Some solid bonus content adds value. The nice hi-def transfer helps make this a marginal recommend. 3 STAR film, 4 STAR Blu-ray

THOUGHTS: With a couple of top-notch stars like this film has, it should have been a singular masterpiece. Instead, the scattershot screenplay has so many inconsistencies and head-scratching lapses in logic that it makes what otherwise could have been a great motion picture merely an interesting diversion. For instance: these guys spend how many months/years together, and yet neither one bothers to learn at least some of the other fellow's language? Basic communication is essential to increase the odds of survival and/or rescue, not to mention simply making their co-existence more bearable. Instead, they spend the film's entire running time screaming at one another in their native tongue. For cryin' out loud, they never even bother to learn each other's names! Really?!? Sorry, not buying it. Totally unrealistic. There's also a very unfocused transition as they go from enemies who first try and kill each other, then just try to annoy each other, then capture one another and torture the other guy... to just suddenly being too exhausted to fight, so they become tolerant acquaintances. Huh??? The downbeat ending is a nice try at poignant irony, but also falls flat in its execution. (The alternate ending, equally as depressing, isn't much better.) Again, I blame ALL of this film's problems on its script, which should've had another two or three passes, at the minimum, in order to eliminate the annoying incongruities and make the narrative flow better. Both actors are excellent, the direction is steady & solid, the cinematography is outstanding and the minimalist musical score is good. However, none of that can overcome a bad script and HELL IN THE PACIFIC has a muddling, mediocre script - at best.

THE BLU-RAY: Now the good news for fans of this film. The hi-def release of HELL IN THE PACIFIC sports a really nice transfer. The picture is crisp & clean, with solid blacks, strong mid-tones, and not much in the way of artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). The original film grain is also wonderfully evident, (no DNR tampering/overscrubbing!). The audio portion is clear and the soundmix is level. There are a half dozen or so bonus features, including interviews with the director and the art director, and a full-length audio commentary track, which help make this Blu-ray a solid bargain. If you love this film, this Blu-ray is a must-own. Casual viewers will still find much to admire, and lots of beautiful scenery to hold their attention. A nice hi-def effort from the crew at Kino Lorber.",1503187200,7,2997,5.052525252525252

3520,5,0764004581,"A terrific third feature from director John Boorman (""Point Blank"",""Excalibur"", ""The Emerald Forest"", ""Deliverance"", ""Zardoz"", ""Hope and Glory"" and the excoriated ""Exorcist II: Heretic"" which crashed and burned so badly that it damage his career for a time ) uses a premise that has been mined for other movies (most notably ""Enemy Mine""). Two enemies (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune ) on opposite sides of the war end up stranded on a deserted island together. At first they fight for resources before realizing that they need each other to escape back to civilization.

Boorman does a terrific job setting up his compositions (with legendary cinematographer Conrad Hall), working with the actors. Both Mifune and Marvin were old enough to serve during World War II so, no doubt, brought some of the memories of the racist view that the Americans and Japanese had of each other during that time. I have to say that I prefer the alternate ending to the one that played in theaters as it doesn't pay off on the journey these two enemies make to becoming friends as they work towards a common goal.

The Blu-ray release from Kino does a good job of presenting the film. The film looks a bit soft in its presentation but I don't doubt this is what the film probably looked like originally during its theatrical run and the intent of Hall. It's always hard to judge because memory can be unreliable. The depth is a bit problematic at times while detail and colors are pretty good.

The audio is presented in 2.0 channel and sounds solid enough.  Lalo Schifrin's score sounds quite nice. We get subtitles in English only (although the Japanese dialog is subtitled in English as well).

Kino provides some interesting and very good special features. Unfortunately, we don't get a commentary track from Boorman but there is a 30 minute interview with him discussing the film. The commentary by Film Historians Travis Crawford and Bill Ackerman is quite good covering the history of the production and various tidbits. The alternate ending is seamlessly branched so you can choose that ending (which I feel is superior but you may have a different opinion if you saw this when it was originally theatrically released). Art director Anthony Pratt  weighs in the production design for the minimalist film in a 11 minute featurette. Kinko also provides five trailers (but curiously not one for ""Hell In the Pacific"").

""Hell In The Pacific"" is an exceptional film. It's a pity that we don't get any sort of surround mix for the sound (it could be that the 2.0 mix is the only remaining version of the soundtrack). I would give this 4 1/2 stars for the alternate ending version and 4 stars for the original theatrical version.",1498608000,10,2713,4.821505376344086

3540,4,0764004581,"Quite a strange movie actually, at once appearing simple but also complex, and the nihilist ending will not please many.

Strictly a ""two-hander"", (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune), the latter speaking only Japanese throughout...no subtitles. You have to rely on Marvin's dialogue, and Mifune's expression. Now this is not as hard as it may sound.

It's also burdened with what has to be the weirdest selection of music as the soundtrack, varying from full church organ, loud discordant atonal concrete music and what surely has to be the sounds of air being allowed to escape from the stretched neck of a rubber balloon at one stage!

A basic story on the surface, just the two men from opposing armies, enemies marooned on an otherwise deserted Pacific island, struggling not only to survive, but hold each other at bay.
At first the motivations seem to be to kill, but gradually that changes to a power play for dominance over and degradation of the other.
The upper hand changes, but gradually realisation sets in that they will have to work together to survive, or even just get along.
The astute may note that as the two are gradually stripped of the trappings of civilisation, they in fact eventually become more ""civilized"", ....and when later some of the outward comforts of the civilised world are available to them,such as clean clothes, shaving and alcohol/cigarettes/magazines, they then fall back into barbarism.
Performances are good, ....although Marvin is perhaps a little too old for the character he's playing. The settings are genuine and their misery well-portrayed as they fight off thirst, starvation and the elements, ...even the sheer boredom.
There is a somewhat odd scene where Marvin tries to teach Mifune to retrieve a stick as a dog would....Mifune is tied most uncomfortably to some sort of a large branch at the time as well as  being hobbled.
Just who is teaching whom is open to interpretation as Mifune refuses and remains mute and impassive.....while Marvin continually demonstrates the demeaning task.
Realising that no one is coming to rescue them, eventually the two begin to tolerate each other, then go further to co-operate enough to build a raft substantial enough to get over the surrounding reef.
This being achieved, they sail off on the open ocean in search of rescue.
A plane is heard, but when Marvin tries to use an old whistle to attract attention, Mifune grabs it and throws it into the water. Just why he does this is unclear.
Eventually the raft drifts to some islands and upon coming ashore the two discover what seems to be a large abandoned military fortified gun emplacement. There are tense moments trying to discover whether it is Japanese or American, and tellingly, Marvin becomes concerned that the eagerly exploring Mifune may be shot by some American forces due to his being Japanese.
Marvin repeatedly cries out ""Don't shoot...don't shoot....he's my FRIEND!""
Mifune appears suddenly from the debris, frightening Marvin who exclaims ""Oh I thought you were a Japanese!""
The point being that although he IS Japanese, Marvin has begun to think of him as something more than just a racial type with whom his country is at war.

It becomes clear that the base is now abandoned after what must have been some heavy fighting, but the two find clothes and saki to salvage, and also clean themselves up, then begin to enjoy some camaraderie over a few drinks.

Another weird scene ensues with Marvin drunkenly asking Mifune why the Japanese don't believe in God.
Marvin himself, (the actor) appears very ill-at-ease performing this bit and it's not entirely successful.
Nor is the reason for this uncomfortable scene at all clear.
Then the pair suddenly become estranged again as Mifune sees some very graphic pictures of slain Japanese in an old Life magazine and wartime hatreds emerge once more.
Then, ...just as you think we will see if their hard-won friendship from the island and the raft journey will last or they will once again become sworn enemies......BANG! That nihilistic ending I previously mentioned happens and that's it.

Many will feel they have sat through a long movie where not a lot of action has happened, only to be denied a proper denouement.
I must admit it looked to me like they didn't quite know how to end it, and so went with the Apocalypse.
You may of course feel differently, but the movie as it stands remains largely a psychological study of two men, rather than any war-action piece.

WARNING: Do NOT watch if the title has you hoping to see some Audie Murphy/John Wayne heroics, with intense battle scenes.
You will be MAJORLY disappointed!

I enjoyed it for the power struggle and the humanity emerging over the nationalism, along with the performances, but must admit to finding the ending far too sudden and a most unsatisfactory way to dispose of two characters you have come to know over such a long movie.
Does it all count for nothing?
I wanted to see what they would do back in a world at war. Would they remain friends, or return to the roles that the war demanded they perform?
I believe some copies include an alternate ending. Mine does not but it is available on You-Tube, and is only about a minute long.
It too is enigmatic, not really telling you all that much about what happened next.

Four stars overall for me. (One off definitely for the ending.)
I have the MRA DVD, ...transfer is good (but not brilliant) and the sound quite loud.",1466467200,,5445,4.84516129032258

I remember standing up in the theater and yelling, ""WHAT?"" People looked at me like I was nuts! I asked the theater manager how the heck can this be and he had no clue.
So, now searching for a blu ray edition of this great Lee Marvin flick to no avail. I sure wish they'd release a nice blu ray version. I love this movie.
I've had the DVD for years now and it's a good version but with these new flat screen OLED (LG has them and this year Panasonic will too) sets that are out now, even a 4K version would be really cool.

Both Lee Marvin (who actually served as a Marine during the war in his youth) , and Mifune, a Japanese ""star"" of quite respectable dramatic stature give fine, necessarily muted performances.  But the plot sort of drifts lazily back and forth in the Pacific Palau, in a dreamy would-be interpretation of individual land-ops which one-on-one combat most assuredly should not  (cinematically) at least) be.  To do Boorman credit, Marvin does eventually bring the subject of the (Christian) God into the confrontation, but it's pretty much too late, and the audience leaves with the somewhat dull effect of having watched a war fought between business boardrooms, one democratic and one fascist, and who really needs that kind of history, if only merely dramatic?

We want our teenage sons to watch it, and decided we will have them see it the same way.

I highly recommend you watch it without subtitles first.

The only part neither of us liked was the ending.  Here was a wonderful movie that had us on the edge of our seats and even after watching the alternate ending, we both though ""What dummy couldn't figure out how to end this?!?!""  Very jarring.

3645,4,0764004581,"I greatly enjoyed 'Hell in the Pacific' and it was more than I expected. I watched this movie the other night and got a lot out of it.

It's a very involving story set during WWII about an American pilot (the great Lee Marvin) and his Japanese counterpart (the equally great Toshiro Mifune) at odds with each other after they are both unknowingly stranded on the same small, uninhabited island in the vast South Pacific Ocean. They fight and quarrel for a good first half of the movie, but ------ realizing that they are both going to have to rely on the other to get out of their situation or to even survive ------ they gradually form an uneasy alliance.

I thoroughly appreciated John Boorman's obvious commitment to realism on this movie. As the film opens up, it just jumps into the story right away, beginning immediately with the image of Toshiro Mifune sitting alone near the beach and Lee Marvin in the jungle, likely just recently dropped in by parachute. The movie wastes no time with set-up or any explanation as to how they both got there. We don't know and don't need to. The editing is done at a smooth, flowing, non-hurried pace which gives the movie a definite real-time feel to it. The scenery and cinematography of the authentic Palau locations is simply stunning and I'm rather amazed by how good this movie looks for its age. The picture quality and clarity of this film is jaw-dropping for a 40 year-old movie.
The performances from the sole two actors in the entire film are passionate, inspired and thoroughly believable. The setting and plot is almost enough to make one forget for a moment that the two are sworn wartime enemies and we almost immediately empathize with both characters.

There are no subtitles. It puts us more inside the two's struggle since neither can understand what the other is saying. Even though those of us who don't speak Japanese can't understand what Toshiro Mifune's character is saying, we know EXACTLY what he is feeling and thinking through actions, body language, and forcefulness of expression. Watch for the scene when Toshiro Mifune's character catches a real, giant clam and proceeds to crack it open to get to the real, soft mollusk inside just for the sake of a meal. After they are finally able to put aside their differences for the sake of their mutual survival, they collaborate to build a rather impressive wooden and bamboo raft to escape the confines of the island.

My only grievance with this movie was its ending. I will not spoil it, but I will say that I did feel it was inconclusive and didn't provide me with adequate closure for the two characters' ultimate fates. Even the alternate ending still left me feeling a bit unfulfilled but I will leave it up to each individual viewer to decide for themself. The ending just didn't quite work for me and was the only element that prevented me from giving this film the full five stars.

Overall though, this is still an excellent and vastly underrated 1968 gem from one of the best directors of all time, John Boorman. A unique cinematic experience in the fact that it features two prolific, unparalled actors each playing anonymous characters who are the only two in the entire movie in such a huge, isolated setting. A fasinating encapsulation of a very human story set against the backdrop of the WWII-era campaign in the Pacific.

17 years later in 1985, this film would be reimagined with a science-fiction twist as 'Enemy Mine'.",1221350400,10,3460,4.720198675496689
3646,4,0764004581,"I find Boorman's direction to be fantastic. As others note two military officers from opposite sides recognize each other. Mifune especially seeks with all his cunning to kill Marvin while the latter struggles very hard just to fill his canteen with drinking water. The tensions, very strong at the beginning slowly dissipate as both realize taking out each
other might be very difficult but via cooperation--even despite the language barriers--two heads can equal the results of three. Mifune shows
his tenderness first. But both play outstanding roles. While trying to develop the peace, Marvin reads a military manual that mandates troops always to kill the enemy.  Their keen attention to the nonverbals, even as both seem not to be observing is a case study for those intererested
in interpersonal communication.  Marvin brings in new vitality once he
recognizes there is bamboo on the island.  Yielding to each other in
a collaborative manner, the raft is built and launched.  Then I got the impression they had to fight high waves without food on the ocean for perhaps four days. Both are exhausted. Discovering the new island is a
dream, that neither perhaps thought would occur.  They forage through
the deserted military hospital, each finding things of special interest  and then dressed neatly as military professionals toast each other
countlessly with a big bottle of booze.  I wasn't ready for the end but
tried to foresee possibilities.  For those who can take a movie with very
limited dialogue, scores of nonverbals and two superb actors, this movie
is a must. Those who enjoy more group drama or romantic entertainment would be bored.  I am glad to have found this movie in my collection. The VHS version plays very well.",1218067200,,1740,5.034843205574913

Yes, it's a product of the 70's, and the visual style embraces that, but the acting is superb.  These were two of the best actors of their generation, and the collaboration must have been an actor's dream for both.  No more spoilers.

3649,4,0764004581,"This is both a serious movie and a parable.  Toshir Mifune plays Captain Tsuruhiko
Kuroda, a proud Japanese Naval officer and Lee Marvin plays a downed American Pilot.  They both end up on a deserted small island.  They are mortal enemies, but somehow when you are both staring death in the face, it is easier to make common cause against it.  The story of the movie is how they overcome their hatred for each other (in the generic - wartime sense) to find a way to be found, signal for help, or get off the island somehow, someway.  Both actors are superb.

The parable is appropriate for a world ravaged by two-world wars the previous sixty years and now facing nuclear annihilation.  We need to pull together or we will die at each other's through for no good reason.  While I don't want to reveal what happens, it is instructive how vanishing cooperation and friendship are once the immediate threat seems to be past.

As I watched the movie, I could see how the Cast Away  and Enemy Mine both seemed to learn and use things from this film.

I think it is a pretty good film that should be seen yet today.

3660,5,0764004581,"Mifune Toshiro once said of himself that he was only a great actor when being directed by Kurosawa.  It is undeniably true.  However, he was always a good actor, and even though only Kurosawa could pull the greatness from him, any Mifune performance is worth checking out.  His American-directed attempts are usually even poorer than his quickly-done super-samurai slugfests, but ""Hell in the Pacific"" is an exception to the rule.  This is good stuff.

The story is not exactly innovative.  It was done four years earlier in the Frank Sinatra flick,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/None-But-the-Brave/dp/B00143XE0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">None But the Brave</a>, which was also a Japanese-American collaboration.  However, whereas Sinatra had an entire platoon to back him up when making a tentative truce with the stranded Japanese castaways, in ""Hell in the Pacific"" there are only two, Lee Marvin and Mifune Toshiro.  Lost on an unpopulated island, the two enemies must first fight, then carve out a grudging respect as they realize the desperateness of their plight, and how little wars mean when there are only two people in existence.

This is a brave and innovative film.  Marvin and Mifune are the only two actors, and everything was filmed on location.  There are no mourning wives waiting for a hopeful return, no platoon of buddies still out looking, no volleyball sidekick.  We aren't even entirely sure how they both arrived there.  None of Mifune's lines are subtitled, so the frustration of communication is powerful, both for the viewer and for Marvin's character.  However, for such a sparse movie, director John Boorman is innovative in his use of location and props to suggestive a broader world.

The ending of ""Hell in the Pacific"" is a story in and of itself.  There are two versions.  One, demanded by US audiences, is a ""happy ending"", although ambiguously so.  The other ending, released for overseas audiences such as the UK and Japan, is explosive to say the least, and far bleaker.

 Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune (The BEST Japanese actor ever), are the perfect team for this unforgettable war story from WW2! An American and a Japanese soldiers are stranded on an isolated island... they are enemies, trying to survive each other, the nature, the isolation from human beings. This movie wakes up all the feelings, that a man can feel- love,fear, pity, anger, compassion, sadness, happiness..., hate- one moment you hate Toshiro's character, then you hate Lee's... ""It's only the two of you, why can't you just live and let live, forgive..."" Very intense,like a roller coaster ride. I saw it as a kid and never forgot it, and at last I was able to find it and GET IT FOR MY OWN MOVIE GALLERY! This movie is priceless and never gets old. And it is too short!

Featuring only two characters throughout---a Japanese officer and an American officer marooned together on a otherwise unpopulated Pacific island in 1944---the film puts us immediately into the difficulties facing the two men, who are enemies by their circumstances and literally cannot understand each other. The story of how they deal with their plight unfolds in ways that make perfect sense, and both Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune as the two exiles give performances that are both believable and affecting. In fact, the only thing that keeps this from being a five-star movie for me is the very end, which, as I suspected, was grafted on at the behest of the studio heads [cf, director John Boorman's autobiography, ADVENTURES OF A SUBURBAN BOY].

In comparison to his other films, I found Hell in the Pacific to be quite boring. I can cleary understand the dialogue between Lee Marvin and Mifune yet the film could have pumped up a notch with at least a shred of Budo action from Mifune. Its evident from their first encounter on the beach that Mifune's raw talent could have produced a dramtic fight scene but they are left standing there, fiercely gazing at one another with no climax.

Telling the story of two pilots, one Japanese (Toshiro Mifune) and one American (Lee Marvin), stranded on a small, deserted tropical island during World War II it's at once fascinating and somewhat flat.  Mifune and Marvin are two of my favorite actors.  Their plight on the island, coveting or guarding precious limited resources against the `enemy', more or less drives home the point that war is a futile exercise.  Of course the question arises as to whether we can conquer our distrust before we conquer, or are conquered by, our enemy.  HELL IN THE PACIFIC is thought-provoking and beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Conrad Hall.

  After a while, though, with all the attacks and counter-attacks, I got the feeling that I was in the middle of a Road Runner cartoon with no exit.  This feeling was exacerbated by such scenes as Marvin trying to teach captive Mifune (the balance of power changes a number of times) to fetch a stick like a dog.  It was an ill-conceived scene, brutishly funny if the intent was humor, but added onto the ridiculous ending HELL IN THE PACIFIC seems to have expended its creative energy well before the final credits run.  By the way, I strongly recommend watching the `Alternate Ending' in the Special Features after watching the movie.

As time goes by they realize their very survival depends on a truce. Eventually they work together and build a raft. After days on the Pacific Ocean they find another larger group of islands. The uneasy truce becomes shaky again when they find remnants of Japanese and American occupation on the main island. Up to this point an excellent movie. In fact I was say close to flawless movie since the acting, sets, scenery, music, directing and all the rest are incredible.

You will be enthralled with the wonderful acting and really care for these two characters. Then to suddenly watch their lifes snuffed out just so some writer or director could make their point that war is bad didn't impress me. If someone didn't think we get that point long before the ending of this movie, they don't give much credit to the audience.

3677,4,0764004581,"""Hell in the Pacific"" is a fairly early film in the career of  John Boorman, a sort of stealth director whose name rarely occurs to you  right away as one of the greats but who has done excellent work over many  decades.  ""Deliverance"" was four years off, ""Excalibur""  and ""Hope and Glory"" further out, and the clean and sharp  ""The General"" a full three decades away.
Lee Marvin is an  American pilot washed up on the shore of a small Pacific island in the  waning days of World War II -- only to find the one other inhabitant is a  Japanese officer played by the awesome Toshiro Mifune.  Although they carry  on the larger war between them for a time, they gradually realize the only  way either is going to survive and get off the island is if they work  together. But can they do it?
Mifune's dialogue is all in Japanese and  not subtitled, so he is as mysterious and threatening to the viewer as he  is to the Marvin character, but we can tell by his actions, self-built  fortifications, and survival schemes that he's a smarter, more disciplined  man than the American. For a time, all the Marvin character can think to do  is pick away at the former's elaborate survival arrangements, and there is  quite a bit of humor in that.
Leonard Maltin and the other Amazon  reviewers complain about the ending, which comes as an abrupt and  dissatisfying shock, but I think it offers the viewer a choice of  interpretations. It could be taken straight, as the objective fate of our  two heroes, or it could suggest a metaphor for their (and our) inability to  get along together, an image of humanity's potential ultimate fate --  something more in the characters' heads than on the ground....
Anyway, a  fine, tight little movie.",958521600,,1729,4.568627450980392
3678,4,0764004581,Although it may not have been the BEST ending to this otherwise fascinating look at the humanity of war. Nonetheless this is a very enjoyable and intriging look at an awkward turn of events for two enemies forced to confront their foe on solitary terms. The ending was war itself.  Irony. Tragedy.
