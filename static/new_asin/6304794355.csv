925079,5,6304794355,"What a touching movie about a father and son.  This is one movie that dispels the African American stereotypical movies that degrade the African American race.  It was Most Excellent.""",1139097600,7,184,5.1

925082,5,6304794355,"Both Louis Gossett, Jr. and Robert R'ichard are very good in their respective roles.  R'ichard, who won an Emmy for his performance, exhibits a wide range of emotions, befitting his character's coming to terms with the death of his father and the realization that he is the ""carbon copy"" of his father.  This is one well-made film that is great for the entire family and should promote discussion and understanding about the importance of all members of the familial unit.",970963200,31,472,4.8875

925200,5,6304794355,Robert Ri'chard was such a good child actor. The range of emotions that he exhibited in this movie was genuine and heartfelt.,1367452800,,125,4.7272727272727275
925201,3,6304794355,"I finally received the movie. I just knew that I had purchased a wide screen version, but received a full screen version. Plus I looked all over for the free music CD and never found it. I can't seem to get an option to contact the seller to discuss this with them, but I really would like the music CD. When the DVD first came up, it stated one price, but when I went to purchase it a different price would come up. I could not seem to get it for the price which was listed during the search. But I love Louis Gossett, Jr. and felt that I would love the movie with the CD, but only received half. I was hoping that once I played the movie, that the music might be part of the DVD, but it was not. There were not even any special features. I would really like to rest of the purchase.",1360800000,,784,3.9683544303797467

925244,5,6304794355,"This little boy stepped into his dad's shoes...constant were the grandparents and his mother.  An underlying theme is that of values in the '50's and '60's when his dad lived and flashing back into a future generation later...This brought tears to my eyes because it brought closure not only for him, but it brought out feelings that just weren't said back then when his dad was growing up.  Baby Boomers MUST see this movie.  My high school chums and I are about to embark on a retreat weekend so I am going to purchase this for all of us to watch!  One of our friends died a few years back, and another one is fighting through her cancer...so there WILL be tears!  There will be great memories from our growing up, too because of the music.  I think all generations would benefit from watching this because they will get to see the '60's in a different view because the dad's friends did not know the meaning of racial discrimination. They became friends based on the values they shared together!  One of the best movies I have seen!  Bravo!",1347062400,,1043,4.51063829787234
925245,5,6304794355,"Kind of a Back to the Future with a pair of shoes.

925246,5,6304794355,This is an excellent movie....I haven't seen it in years and I nearly cried when I saw it. At first when he puts on the wingtip shoes he doesnt know what is happening and everytime he put them on he was in a different part of his fathers life. But when he finally stands up to his Grandfather for his Father made a really connection between Fathers & Sons. ****I LOVED IT!!! EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!****,1316649600,2,413,4.376623376623376
925247,1,6304794355,this was a terrible movie. it was slow and didn't make a whole lot of sense. i wanted to return it for a full refund but because i opened it it was to late.,1295395200,,156,3.6176470588235294

7877301,5,6304794355,"If you are looking for a heart-warming film, this is perfect! I use this movie in my 8th grade classroom when discussing mood for writing/reading/viewing.  We also discuss character development.  Usually the movie produces some tears from students who don't always like to show emotion, and I have never had a single student complain about ""having"" to watch this movie.  Very good movie.",1468022400,,387,5.111111111111111
7877302,5,6304794355,"I Love this music, and remain so frustrated that I can't acquire by any means, the music that accompanies the Final credits, which I believe may be named ""Goodnight"". This song, puts the emotional dagger into ones heart that was already beating strong for the ordinary, if a boys greatest daily quest, TO AVOID GETTING HIS BUTT KICKED"" LOL. This song is one of the most beautiful songs ever to enter my ears, and I have been into music, since I was in 3rd grade.

Without doing any spoiling let me say that the little boy in every man, or dare I say the little girl in every woman, will tug at the heartstrings to undertake just such a quest.... where do I sign, and where do I get my shoes, I've read every credit in BIG, and nowhere in there do they list the location of a Zoltar nowadays. : )

Ahhhh to go back to when playing was real playing, that would be circa pre-Atari. The adventures that our hero herein were even more difficult because due to the requirement to wear Dad's shoes, otherwise I think he would wear P.F. FLIERS to run harder and jump higher if  I recall the MADMEN wording correctly.

Someone please give credit to the closing song, and of all the substandard slow jam music these days, this song would stop traffic. I Highly recommend giving this movie a looksee, and if buying rather than streaming is what we're reduced to it will be wort it just to get the tune at the end, as if the movie wasn't already touching every emotion. Goodnight!! ; + )",1459728000,,1475,4.352727272727273
