hope it gets better",1371772800,,150,4.0
8100890,4,B000CR7R70,"So this is an indie film about the idea that there is a water contaminant that hits the L.A. water supply.  Interesting idea.  Then I heard that the band Dredg did the soundtrack and I was even more interested...

...overall, the movie looks good, the story is good, and the acting is good, but overall, the way the story flows and pieces together was not that well executed.  There is a scene with two of the main characters who are like best friends, but then when they cut back to them later the two are fighting and we were all like, ""What the heck was that?""  I think we missed something...

It is kind of funny to watch the actor that was ""Uncle Rico"" in Napoleon Dynamite try to act like an military leader.  I just could not buy it, but that is me.  Haha.

So overall, it was a decent film, but the overall execution of it was not as well done as I was hoping for.",1214956800,,872,4.142857142857143
8100891,4,B000CR7R70,"""Waterborne"" is one of those films that start a bit slow, but meshes together rather well right up to the end. Chris Masterson does a fine job, though I half expected Jane Kaczmarek to appear, admonishing her son! Shabana Azmi (City Of Joy) and Ajay Naidu do well as mother and son, trying to make a living, as Asian ""foreigners"" in L.A. Mageina Tovah (Spiderman) plays the girlfriend, an outsider that has fallen in love with the son.

What happens when major water supplies become contaminated, and only bottled water can be trusted? What would you do, to secure this precious commodity for yourself, and your family? Not only that, but how would it be, if a ""foreigner"" told you that the price went up, or you could only buy so much, and no more? How does a populace face this crisis?

""Waterborne"" gives us a possible scenario as to what might happen, were that situation to arise. It's not pretty. It's a bit odd that thirst wasn't a big part of this film. Hatred was. Hatred of authority, hatred of other Races, hatred of a system that when the going gets tough, doesn't address the most simple of needs. Look also, to the location. Los Angeles was a desert before some greedy developer (or developers) decided to drop a few buildings and houses, and call it good. This all adds up to the situation you see in ""Waterborne"".

The events you will see in ""Waterborne"" are plausible, if not probable, if this scenario were to become fact. In the post-911 world, panic and fear are the only commodities to be counted on. Sounds pretty bleak, eh? In this film, a lesson IS learned however, about being a member of the human race. An uplifting finale is the reward.

In all, a very fine film. Highly recommended.",1207612800,4,1711,4.563517915309446
8100892,4,B000CR7R70,"I caught this movie back in 2005 when it was shown at the SXSW festival and even after all these years, it still stands out firmly in my mind. There aren't too many movies that do that for me. The writing is incredible, the acting is never dull and the soundtrack is just haunting. I am glad that this movie finally found its way onto DVD so that more people can experience it.",1206921600,,377,4.178082191780822
8100893,1,B000CR7R70,"If you enjoy a thought-provoking disaster DVD with lots of  fu** and sh** words you will only be happy about the cursing.  OK, OK, you might overlook the bad language if not for the mediocre acting, low budget effects, and a plot you could guess long before the end.  It was so bad that I skipped the entire middle of the movie to see the last two scenes.

Sure glad that I only rented this.  Now, the Poseidon, that is a good disaster flick.",1157500800,8,442,4.214285714285714
8100894,5,B000CR7R70,Really original and potent. A little too much cursing for my taste and the some picture clarity comes out a little amateurish. Good Acting and plot saves the day.,1156896000,2,162,4.620689655172414
8100895,3,B000CR7R70,"A movie made using a very interesting subject...water. But what is scary is that it could happen to any city....Terrorism...

Interesting enought to not put it down halfway thru

The movie follows the action of differrent individuals instead of

using a big scale scenario.

This works, but it feels more like a TV movie.

Good to watch...at leat for one showing...but thats about it.",1155168000,,384,4.9375
8100896,4,B000CR7R70,"This movie is a journey into the minds of several random, good-hearted people in a time of crisis.  The plot could call for a big-budget Hollywood disaster movie, but this is the opposite.  Ben Rehki wanted to create a movie that had not been done before.  Mission accomplished.  This film essentially predicted the disaster that was the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  Water is no longer available.  How long can you stay sane without any liquid in your system while fighting the balmy, hot summer of Los Angeles?  Not long.  Good acting, unique cinematography, and an extremely relevant plotline.  Not to mention one of the best movie scores ever composed from the most important rock band in America, dredg.",1143244800,5,721,4.991596638655462
8100897,5,B000CR7R70,"In this psychological thriller, in the tradition of Crash, a series of interconnected stories reveals the emotional cost and real devastation that happen when LA's water supply is attacked with a biological agent. People everywhere are dying, and the water is so unsafe it can't be touched, let alone drunk. Soon all the bottled water is gone and over the next 72 hours, everyone must decide what's really important to them.

This movie is quick, smart, and the cast works well together. It not only addresses issues of global import, but peels back your eyelids to make you see snippets of human interaction, some of which are touching, some of which are caustic, and all of which smack of truth given the situation. It's the kind of film you will want to watch with friends and family, because you'll want to talk about it afterward.

Rent this movie if you feel like investing a bit of yourself and thinking for a long time afterwards about everything.

If you liked Crash, you'll like this.

Recommended.",1143244800,5,1008,4.775862068965517
8100898,3,B000CR7R70,"WATERBORNE is thematically linked to this year's surprise Oscar winner, CRASH.  Both movies use interchanging characters who undoubtedly will somehow connect by the end of the movie.  While CRASH's screenplay and acting are impeccably better, WATERBORNE does have a good cast of relative unknowns working their hearts out to be convincing, and it does have the best of intentions in showing what could happen if a water supply became tainted and how we would react.  We have our prejudice examined in the form of an Indian family (or Pakistani?  they never really say) who runs a market and are trying to ration the sale of their water supply.  The young son also has fallen for a Caucasian girl who teaches yoga and is quite nice in fact.  Next we have two cousins whose vocabulary basically consists of the ""F"" word in every other sentence.  One is a mature responsible dude while the other is a ticking time bomb waiting to explode, which of course he does.  We also get a couple of National Guardsmen who find themselves facing normal American citizens who are breaking the law by stealing water; tragedy ensues of course.

WATERBORNE is a noble effort and is to commended for its unusual theme.  Sometimes the situations aren't really credible and the reactions of some of the leads is tenuous but for a small indie film, WATERBORNE is worth a see.",1141689600,3,1353,4.76824034334764
