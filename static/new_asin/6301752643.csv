350319,5,6301752643,"I remember owning this as a young kid & watching it innumerable times every year around Christmas, I loved it! There are some classic Disney Silly Symphonies on this, such as, ""Winter"", ""Santa's Workshop"" & ""The Night Before Christmas"" just to name a few. Luckily for those who don't have VCRs anymore, like myself, people have uploaded the videos onto YouTube, yay! Watching the Silly Symphonies really takes you back, it's so much fun to watch them again.

I highly recommend watching this with the family, it's one that everyone will enjoy, it's cute & funny.

If you like this, I also recommend Disney's Halloween Treat for whenever Halloween comes around.",1370476800,,660,4.936936936936937
350320,4,6301752643,"I remember this movie/show being aired on television as a kid. This VHS was not exactly it. I believe they took from this film, and created a somewhat different version to air on television.",1358121600,,190,4.617647058823529
350321,5,6301752643,Used to watch this every year on a vhs my mom had it recorded on. Wish they wld make it in dvd. Nevertheless bought it for my 2 yr old to watch with me. She is hooked. Watches it over and over and sings the songs. It makes me so happy.,1355184000,4,235,3.627450980392157
350322,5,6301752643,"I was four years old in 1984 when the Disney Channel was brand new, and even though we didn't have a lot of money at the time, my mother saw fit to get that ""premium"" cable channel for us.  I can tell you, it had one of the most lasting effects on me personally, and certainly on my family, as a whole.  Those were the good old days of Disney tv programs.  The cartoons, films, programs, and even the original Disney Channel movies were all classics that we looked forward to every day.  For me, they all represented the imaginative humor of Walt Disney and were nothing short of magical.  Alas, those days are gone!

This video (along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jiminy-Cricket-s-Christmas/dp/B000ANEU6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jiminy Cricket's Christmas</a>) was one of the excellent programs that would air on Christmas Eve throughout the mid- to late-1980's and early '90s.  Right before it started, my younger sister and I would hurry to turn on the Christmas tree lights, quickly snatch and curl up with a blanket, and be absolutely mesmerized for 47 fun-filled minutes.

There are some great Disney choir original songs on the video in between some classic Disney Christmas cartoons and snippets from feature-length films.  During the songs, it shows some really neat antique Disney character toys under a tree.  But that's just the cool edge that you'd expect from this company.  The real meat of this video is the compilation of some great hard-to-find cartoons.  I won't put a complete list of the cartoons that are featured on this review, but a couple of my favorites are ""Once Upon a Winter Time"" (1948) and the 1933 color Silly Symphony rarity, ""The Night Before Christmas"" showing jolly Old Saint Nicholas visiting a house full of sleeping kids and filling their stockings.  Of course, there are several classic features including Donald Duck and other familiar characters.

If you love any of the old-time Disney cartoons (which -- let's be honest -- are actually TRULY funny, unlike most of these newer programs), then you will love this old VHS.  Get your hands on a copy.  (While we're on the subject, why doesn't Disney come out with a ""Disney Classics Channel""?!  I'd be the first in line!)

Now that I'm in my late 20's with our first child due a few days before Christmas, I am SO excited to share future Christmas Eves with him, carrying on the same tradition of watching this program the night before Santa comes, just as I did 20+ years ago with my little sister.",1260144000,9,2544,4.973995271867612
350323,5,6301752643,"A Disney Christmas Gift is the Holiday equivallent to Disney's Halloween Treat. It starts out with the wonderfull music only story of the young couple and the young rabbit couple. It also boasts the family favorite where Chip& Dale end up in Mickey and Plutos Christmas tree and Twas the Night before Christmas in which the Old Disney Santa stops to play with the toys until he wakes up the 8+ little kiddies all out of one bed. It also has clips from Bambi, Peter Pan, Cinderella, and Sword in the Stone. My kids watch it spell bound, just as I did 20+ years ago. No it isn't some new fangled animated digi-fied anything. It is just good old fashioned family quality Disney. What can I say... My favorite!",1251072000,9,706,4.48062015503876
350324,5,6301752643,"I have grown up watching this video. My family has watched it so much that it is nearly worn out. This video has scenes straight from other Disney movies such as Bambi, Cinderella, and Peter Pan. Some people may not appreciate the cuts from other movies but the scenes relate to the joy of Christmas. In Disney tradition, there are cheesy little songs that help the transition from one clip to the next, but i think its neat. I treasure this film and I'm buying another one to show to my children some day.",1099180800,2,506,4.3936170212765955
350325,5,6301752643,"A Disney Christmas Gift is a whimsical and jolly Christmas video that deserves a place in every family's collection. This fantastic movie contains Christmas clips from a few of the greatest Disney masterpieces ever made and even some scenes that do not take place on Christmas but delight hearts of all ages. Each clip is introduced with a special Christmas song that will soon have you singing along. With classics such as Bambi and Peter Pan to everyone's favorites Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, and Chip-an-Dale, your whole family will enjoy watching this movie at any time of year, especially around Christmas.",971395200,19,618,5.068627450980392
7814562,5,6301752643,"In honor of Christmas in July, here's another review on another great Disney Christmas compilation, in this case A Disney Christmas Gift from 1982! It was originally seen on TV in 1982 and released on VHS at least 1 year afterward, and reissued any number of times until 2001, when it was finally vaulted. Throughout this video are bits from the following classic Disney shorts; Once Upon A Wintertime (1948/'54), Pluto's Christmas Tree (1952), The Clock Watcher (1944), Santa's Workshop & The Night Before Christmas (1932/'33), as well as a few of Disney's major animated features (besides Melody Time, #10, in the case of Once Upon A Wintertime); Bambi (#5; 1942), Peter Pan (1953; #14), The Sword in the Stone (1963, #18, which debuted on Christmas Day that year!), & Cinderella (1950, #12); all wrapped around with live-action footage and the famous choir's singing that made this special so great to this very day! It's a crying shame this and many other Disney holiday compilations will never surface on authorized DVDs, only by bootleggers! Not even Sony's DVDirect's can transfer ANY of Disney's videotapes to DVD, regardless of the tapes' age or condition, not even the Disney Movie Club's videotapes made after Bambi 2 in 2006, all the way up to Cars 1 and Cinderella 3 in 2007! Just be thankful for what you still have, as I keep saying! Merry Christmas in July, everybody!",1500940800,,1384,4.8936170212765955

7814565,5,6301752643,I bought this when my daughter was little and we always enjoyed watching it. She is now 31 and has a 3 yr old daughter that she is going to watch this with. I was on here looking to see if there is a DVD available and thought I would add my thoughts. One of the best and brings back so many great memories and I know it will be the same with my daughter and her daughter. I hope sometime it will be re-released like so many of the Disney movies are. It is  great to watch at Christmas.,1481414400,,485,3.85

7814570,5,6301752643,"Growing up my sister and I would watch this movie every single Christmas.  As you can imagine 20 some-odd years later our copy was nearing the grave.  I have been searching for this on DVD for many moons...never found it.  I did however find this awesome used copy.  I normally do not buy things that are used from amazon but...sometimes for memories you must take a risk.  It arrived in the mail in adequate time, the cover was in great condition and the movie was as well.  I was very impressed with this and I am so grateful to have a spare copy in such great condition.  The tradition shall carry on for hopefully another 20 years.",1390608000,,635,4.3760683760683765

MY daughter and I will camp out in her room with popcorn and several Disney videos like this one and watch them.  The short videos on this paticular tape are wonderful.  We do and will always look forward to watching these at Holiday time !",1373846400,,397,3.876543209876543
