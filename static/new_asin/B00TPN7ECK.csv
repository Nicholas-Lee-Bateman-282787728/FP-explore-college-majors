7015593,5,B00TPN7ECK,This is a review by a 6yo kid. I love this show because they can shrink and I would love to have a magic school bus. When I start going to sleep I imagine that I was one of the kids in Magic School Bus and that I was shrinking with them. I have watched Season 1 and about a quarter of Season 2.,1439942400,,294,3.609375
