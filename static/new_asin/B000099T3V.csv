1881692,5,B000099T3V,This was a great dvd except sometimes they are off beat and the fact that beyonce was missing an earring and nobody told her and her solo perfomance took a bit of a long time but overall it was a great dvd,1083196800,,205,3.9047619047619047
1881693,5,B000099T3V,"I don't understand all the complaints about Beyonce and Kelly's hairstyles in the reviews- both ladies look more than fine to me in this DVD. (Michelle looks great too, I wouldn't turn any of them down). I love the way they do a gospel medley and proclaim their devout Christian beliefs, and then go straight into a most sinful performance of ""Bootylicious""! Beyonce, Kelly and Michelle look extraordinarily sexy throughout this DVD, which climaxes with the ladies going barefoot and in jungle bikinis for ""Survivor"", then doing a mini-striptease for ""Happy Face""! Amazing!",1068681600,2,573,5.172043010752688
1881694,5,B000099T3V,"you know how some artists don't sound as good live? Destiny's Child proved in this astounding DVD that they can sing just as well in a concert as they can in the studio. It's true that, live, this group has a somewhat different sound, but in my opinion, the effect of a new sound to their songs is excellent. The harmony is still as outstanding as it is on their CD's, if not better. Beyonce, Kelly, and Michelle also have commendable solo performances, proving that each member of this group can hold her own. The stunning special effects and the screaming audience showed me, at least, that these girls really try to make fans feel they got their money's worth. Besides the concert, there are also some bonus videos, including Kelly Rowland's heart-wrenching ""Stole"", and Michelle Williams's smooth, jazzy first single, ""Heard A Word"". So, if you love DC or just a good show, you won't be disappointed!

1881696,4,B000099T3V,"This DVD is really worth it...it is the first Original DVD that I bought..and it is a real good buy. The concert is real good and although a lot of ppl say that beyonc's 'fro doesn't suit her...any Destiny's CHild fan would say that doesn't matter. It doesn't suit her too much but she still sings the same. Kelly's hair I hate! It is simply atrocious...it looks like she hasn't even run a brush thru it. IF Kelly's hair was better, it would have achieved 5 stars. Michelle is jus' the same
If u a DC fan...get it!",1061510400,,514,4.255102040816326
1881697,5,B000099T3V,"The world tour begins telling the ""Story of Destiny"" and then Destiny's Child sings Independent Women, which is usually ALWAYS their opening act. They all look good, except for Beyonc's hair, the fake afro.  I hate that hair so much. Newayz they do a excellent job performing their songs together.  Most artists don't sound good when they perform, but Destiny's Child sounds just like themselves.  The Europeans got a performance of ""Get on the Bus"" which was the first song Destiny's Child ever recorded and one of the hottest.  The after they performed their cover of ""Emotion"" they do solo performances.  Kelly sings a cover of ""Ooh Child"", Michelle sings her single ""Heard A Word"" and Beyonc sings ""Dangerously In Love"" the title track of her solo album, her best song vocally, that she wrote and produced herself.  Then Kelly and 'Chelle come back on stage and join Beyonc for a performance of their ""Gospel Medley"".  Then they do my favorite performance of the night, ""Bootylicous"". Then anothere #! hit ""Say My Name"".  Kelly and 'Chelle leave stage and Bee sings her song ""Work It Out"" from the Austin Powers 3 Soundrack. Then they join again and sing ""Proud Mary"" and Bee dances crazy again and on their next song ""Jumpin', Jumpin"" Beyonc becomes noticably out of breath.  Then they go change into the ""Survivor"" outfits which is a grassy skirt and grassy top which they rip off and have jean shorts and tops on that have happy faces on them when they sing their finale song...""Happy Face"".  The DVD contains Kelly and 'Chelle's solo videos along with Bee's sister Solange's video.  Overall this DVD was definatly worth my $$.",1058140800,3,1634,4.8
1881698,4,B000099T3V,"I'm not a Destiny's Child fan, but I've always liked most of their songs and the DVD was really inexpensive. As a concert DVD addict and drummer, I was curious what quality show they put on. The answer is: Rocking! They have a ton of energy and the performance is tight. The girls can sing and they know their stuff. The coolest part for me was the band, particularly the rhythm section (which is the most prominent part of their music besides the vocals). The drummer (Khari Parker) is amazing and the bass/drum combo is locked in together incredibly tight. It's awesome. My biggest complaint is that they use alot of vocal tracks. The lead vocals are always live, but many of the supporting vocals are recordings (as far as I can tell). The girls have a few songs where they obviously are singing together as a trio and it sounds good. It's kind of cheesy that they feel they need to use non-live vocals, but I can understand the rational. Most of the fans probably don't know the difference and prefer to have the vocals sound just like the record. My other complaint is that they don't show the musicians except in the brief (but very cool) solo sections. I can understand that, too. Regardless, it's a great concert. Highly recommended...",1058054400,2,1243,4.603603603603603
1881699,4,B000099T3V,"THE DVD IS SIMPLY AMAZING, THE OPENING IS TYTE TO DEATH, THE SONGS AND THE ENERGY IS SO HIGH, U GET SUCKED INTO THE SHOW... AND TO BE HONEST, THIS WAS ONE OF THE OKAY SHOWS, EVEN THOUGH THEY STILL DELIVER. BEYONCE EXPLODES WITH PASSION ON DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE, AND MICHELLE TEARS IT UP ON NASTY GIRL AND HEARD A WORD, KELLY'S OOH CHILD IS SO BEAUTIFUL. COSTUMES ARE GREAT, HAIR COULD HAVE USED SOME TOUCH UPS..... BUT NONE THE LESS THEY DELIVER FROM BEGINNING TO END.

1881700,5,B000099T3V,"michelle, beyonce, and kelly all give the performance of their lives. actually, the tour of their lives. just oiver a year after their world tour, music world music and sony dvd have released this dvd featuring their 2002 concert set.

the show starts with independent women, featuring amazing fire effects and dancing. the shiny gold costumes accompany dc as they perform imdependant women, no no no, bills bills bills, get on the bus,and nasty girl (their dancers dressed as ""nasty girls"").
when they return to stage, they are wearing stunning red and diamond gowns, as they peform emotions, heard a word (michelle solo), ohh child (kelly solo), and dangerously in love/work it out (beyonce's solo's). after an acappela gospel medley that blows you off your seat,a dance break featuring the male dancers is on as the ladies change.
as they dance and sing bootylicious, say my name, jumpin jumpin, and a rendition of missy elliots ""get ur freak on"", michelle, beyonce and kelly all wear purple and silver tassled mini skirts and silver diamond bra tops. their dancers are leather clad.
when they re emerge for the finale, dc wear jungle grass skirts and amazon tops, and their dancers are all wearing jungle themed clothes too. they all blow you away with the dance for ""survivor"", and a bongo drum solo buy the 3 of them tops it off. then, onstage, they remove the jungle clothes to reveal graffiti, diamond denim mini shorts and tops to perform ""happy face"", the huge finale featuring happy faced balloons falling from the roof.
dc do a great job at this concert tour, which features live vocals, live band, and dancers, along with special stage effects and lighting to die for. there are also costume changes and solo songs.
add to this an array of special features, and you have a PERFECT dvd. but this dvd, you will not be dissapointed :-)",1053648000,19,1845,4.80188679245283

7990244,3,B000099T3V,"I was at this concert in Rotterdam, and I absolutely went crazy when they made their first entrance!! But throughout the show I was a bit bored ,especially because they didn't showed the energy that I am jused to see of them. It also seemed like they weren't giving it their all and their were doing a rehearsel instead of a show. Compared to the Destiny Fulfilled and loving it tour DVD,this one was a allot less creative and energenic. Overall it isn't a bad show,but it certainly wasn't their best. I love the Gospel Medley though :D Hopefully this was a helpfull revieuw for y'all ;)",1154390400,2,587,4.4953271028037385
7990245,4,B000099T3V,"This concert, from a 2003 performance in Rotterdam (The Netherlands), is full of energy and features a great mix of vocals and music that will please any follower of Destiny's Child or fan of R&B music concerts.  The show has an exciting opening with ""Independent Women"" (gets me off my seat every time), followed by a half-dozen more jammin' dance hits, then calms down in the middle with some slow grooves (featuring Kelly and Michelle as leads), and resumes with more dance jams through to the end.  It's a well-paced show.  The girls look and sing great, the band is tight, and the dancers add a nice ingredient to the funk-party setting.  If you're a DC fan or a collector of concert videos, you'll be happy buying this DVD.

With a run-time of around 80 minutes, it's not a long concert.  The good news is that the time is filled pretty well since there isn't an excess of mindless chatter or audience sing-alongs.  The tunes are very much the same as recorded on CD, and the girls do a nice job with their renditions of ""Emotion,"" ""Ooh Child"" and ""Proud Mary.""  The stage is set up to give lots of room to the girls and the dancers, and the sound and picture quality are very good.

Just a few minor criticisms:  1) too frequently, the editing was overly rapid, to the point where there was no way to get a decent look at the choreography, which is one of the things I focus on in shows like this; 2) save for the solo features, the camera shot selection was heavily biased in favor of Beyonce; don't get me wrong, she's a gorgeous lead, but I wanted to watch Kelly and Michelle more because they're good performers too; 3) the short run-time could have been complemented by behind-the-scenes footage or artist/musician interviews to produce more of an entertainment experience.

DVD extras include three bonus videos:  hits by Solange (Beyonce's sister, and a talented artist in her own right, who does ""Feelin' You, Part II""), Kelly (""Stole"") and Michelle (""Heard A Word"").  They're good.",1137369600,4,1997,4.639204545454546
7990246,4,B000099T3V,"I love the fact that my favorite group of all time has a DVD! Although it's a bit outdated, it still doesn't get old. Destiny's Child prove that they have what it takes to get a crowd pumped up in this energy filled DVD. Michelle and Kelly are great crowd pleasers, but of course, Beyonc steals the show!

7990247,2,B000099T3V,Considering I found this dvd in Walmart for $10 I thought I was literally in for a treat. Not likely. First off my main problem with the girls is that they lip synched too much throughout the whole show. They could've at least redid the backing vocals instead of them obviously sounding like Beyonc. I saw the same exact show live and it had way more energy than this excuse of a performance. It must've been taped during the end of the tour because all 3 girls looked tired. If you literally want your money's worth I suggest you pick up Beyonc's Live in Wembley show because her performance of Dangerously in Love was weak compared to a more matured version on her dvd. Don't even get me started on Michelle's song Heard A Word. Babygirl was straining to hit the high notes towards the end and I'm surprised it wasn't edited out because she sounded bad!.I love the girls to the heart but this was a bad idea.,1129248000,6,910,4.390532544378698
7990248,5,B000099T3V,This is the best dvd concert i ever saw the concert its awesome and the three music vids make it better go ahead and buy it believe me you will enjoy it,1121558400,3,152,3.78125
7990249,3,B000099T3V,"Destiny's Child is one of my favorite female R&B groups, just behind The Emotions and En Vogue.  That said, I really expected this DVD of their 2003 world tour to really captivate my attention.  On some points, it did, but on many others it left a lot to be desired.

I did enjoy a few select performances of their classic hits.  My favorite was their ""Gospel Medley"", in which the girls really blended well with each other and shows you that they can really SANG!  ""Happy Face"" was an added treat, for it looked like they had a lot of fun doing it and singing it.  I loved the interlude of ""Proud Mary"", in which the girls' harmonies were sounding really good.  Also worth mentioning is ""Get On the Bus"", in which they ended with a new spin on the chorus, and it was funny to see Beyonce' take over Kelly's lead with Kelly standing there with an attitude and Beyonce' rolling her eyes looking like ""what?!"".  That was TOO funny.  Also, the end of ""Nasty Girl"" was too funny with Michelle in her usual comedic element.

Beyonce' actually amazed me with her control over her voice when she sang ""Dangerously In Love"".  I have never heard her sing so LOW.  She really got down there at the end of the song.  Also, the bonus music videos were an added treat, although I would have liked to see ""Get On the Bus"" and ""Nasty Girl"".

There is just too much wrong with this DVD for me to thoroughly enjoy it.  First, I have nothing against DC, but I don't like the fact that they were blatantly and obviously lip-synching the choruses in their songs.  I say obvious because the background vocals sound far away while the leads are loud, and on a couple of songs the background vocals sound really karaoke and not very DC-esque.  Also, I really saw no real point for the few solos that were included.  ""Ooh Child"" was a horrible remake, and I expected it to be a lot better, a la DC's performance with Cyndi Lauper on the Rock Against Breast Cancer TV special a few years ago.  Also, Michelle sounded a little off on her solo song ""Heard A Word"".  And, on the solos, I really would have loved to see the other members on stage singing the background vocals to each others' solo songs.

Another problem I had was the lackadaisacal feel of the concert.  DC really didn't give us much energy -- I've seen more energy from them on talk show performances.  Oftentimes, Beyonce' looked as if she didn't want to be there but had to be, and it painfully showed in a lot of her singing or lack thereof.  Also, the DVD is obviously edited because in the scope of ten seconds the girls went from skirts and shorts on ""Nasty Girl"" to evening gowns on ""Emotion"".  Huh?  I deperately wanted to see the Michael Jackson routine on ""Bootylicious"" but that was edited out as well.  And, I would have loved to see some type of interview or something instead of the printed biography that was given.

Hopefully, if DC releases another concert on DVD, it's unedited and actually has the girls singing a lot more and with a lot more energy.",1116201600,10,3009,4.411978221415608
7990250,3,B000099T3V,DC those are my girls and the concert was okay. Beyonce looked like she was tired but still gave a good performance. I have seen them perform with alot more energy. It was an entertaining DVD.  I liked the ending when they sang Happy Face. I wanted to cry b/c I was feeling down at the time and you have to put on a happy face. I liked how they had the little kids on stage singing and dancing with them. That was great.,1097452800,,420,4.0
