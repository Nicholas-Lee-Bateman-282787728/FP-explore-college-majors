I used this in conjunction with ""Gorillas in the Mist"" in my High school Biology class particularly when I was gone and had a substitute covering the class.  I would include a writing assignment to go along with the viewing.",1418860800,,246,4.6976744186046515
8235502,5,B000ZIZX40,"Good presentation of efforts in saving and preserving the life of
the mountain gorilla family. These efforts are the results of many
people and contributors. Wildlife conservation and prevention of
cruelty should be our life time focus for the future of our fragile
planet.",1372723200,,273,5.2272727272727275
8235503,5,B000ZIZX40,I work at the zoo with the Apes.  I am always looking for something on DVD or in book form to donate for our silent auction every year.,1290988800,,135,3.8214285714285716
8235504,4,B000ZIZX40,"I bought this documentary with expectations and doubts, but now I can assure is really espectacular!... I enjoyed very much the good quality of image and sound and the story itself. If you are curious and interested in documentaries about wildlife conservation, this is one for getting. It is shown in the new format (widescreen), very far from those bored documentaries related to wildlife... In conclusion if you are interested in mountain gorillas and to know the reality around the conservation of these creatures, if you like to see beautiful landscapes, as well as to enjoy a good story beside natalie portman in a different face to her traditional work in the cinema... I recommend you this documentary 100%...",1255737600,2,717,5.033613445378151
8235505,4,B000ZIZX40,"I thought Gorillas on the Brink was well-produced with beautiful shots of Africa and good information on the things that people are doing to save the gorillas. Natalie Portman is an interesting, sincere host. If you like her as an actress, you will probably like this DVD.

The only reason that I give it 4* instead of 5* is that I wish there was more footage of the actual gorillas. There are a significant number of segments where Natalie is interviewing/having conversations with conservationists and experts, but there isn't a gorilla in sight. Since this isn't shot in a zoo, you have to remember that the camera-people are trying to get shots of the gorillas in their natural habitat, and sometimes it is hard to get close enough to get that perfect shot. That said, there is an especially interesting segment where Natalie, Jack Hanna, and Natalie's mother are standing and observing a group of gorillas (in very close proximity). Great shots and also great tension during this segment!

If you are interested in gorillas, this DVD provides plenty of information and perspectives, and it will give you some memorable footage of them, but it isn't jam-packed.",1249344000,4,1165,4.908629441624366
8235506,5,B000ZIZX40,"Thought I tend to watch documentaries more then anything else (at least in preference), I'll admit to staying on this film as opposed to skipping past it because of Portman.  She strikes me as genuine.

The film does what is supposed to. It shows that these animals seem to have qualities that mimic our own. It shows they are suffering like many of our own. It shows that it doesn't take many people to really make a difference in the world.

These gorilla's are in essence becoming Refugees.

4 stars for the film + 1 star for the host
