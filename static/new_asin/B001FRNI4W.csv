8302448,3,B001FRNI4W,I was stationed at Tuy Hoa from1968-69 and thought this would be a nice DVD to have.  It does and does not really show the complete construction of the base and the base defense as it progressed or of all the units that were stationed there by the end of 1969 and the structures that were finally built.  There was a TV documentary in 1968 that showed Tuy Hoa's construction and the first sorties that were flown from it and the living conditions in tents.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't show more but it did bring back a lot of memories.  Thank-you for the effort.,1474070400,,578,4.324074074074074
8302449,4,B001FRNI4W,"A good friend I was with in Vietnam told me about this video product. I could not get into the sellers web-site, my security software told me there was something wrong but refered me to Amazon.com for the product. The video is as good as what the military did. I wish the video had provided some sound during the USO show because I was in the video presenting Martha Raye with flowers at the end of her show. I like the product. You can't do better than Amazon.com.",1278633600,3,465,4.295454545454546
