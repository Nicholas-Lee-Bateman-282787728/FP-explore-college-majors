7914764,2,B00001U0I8,"The Heist was your typical big holdup caper movie; you have your gang of well-dresssed, well-armed bad guys (explosives man, safe cracker,  electrician, sexy killer girl, psycho guy and McCarthy, the leader who  might fall for the pretty employee); you have your high tech, your dumb  guards, and of course, lots of dead employees and cops. You might rewind  after 15 minutes if it weren't for Cynthia Geary's performance.  A  pathetically lean script (McCarthy says about 100 words in the whole caper)  guarantees lots of overacting. This movie is hard to take seriously, but  with popcorn and bad weather you can make it to the credits - well worth it  for the great closing soundtrack song.",964396800,,693,4.905172413793103
