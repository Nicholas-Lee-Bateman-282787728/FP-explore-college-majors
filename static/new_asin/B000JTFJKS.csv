My big silly 4 year old Friesian/Andalusian cross managed to get his hind leg wrapped up in some electric fence tape (turned off luckily, although he would have never done this if it was on) and basically tied his hind leg to a t-post.  Your average horse would have freaked out and hurt himself, possibly badly.  He just patiently stood there waiting for me to come out and cut him loose.  He hadn't even rubbed off any hair, so he hadn't struggled at all.  I'm sure a big part of this comes from him knowing how to be hobbled, which I learned from this DVD.  Clinton Anderson's Method works, on this and any of his other stuff.  Clear cut, black and white, the horses understand it and it is easy to train.  This DVD set also shows how to lay down a horse.",1389139200,2,850,4.236024844720497
