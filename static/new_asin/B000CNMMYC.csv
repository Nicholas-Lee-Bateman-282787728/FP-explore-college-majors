Not like today, when music videos all look pretty much the same. Of course, the Christian music industry, which always seemed a step or two behind, wanted a similar product, but low budgets and a small market with rigid expectations led to a limited number of video releases that tended to be a little bland.

Then along came Steve Taylor. While a few Christian artists would occasionally dare to release an album with one mildly satirical track, his albums were crammed with satire that was not only biting, but so witty, you couldn't help laughing at the hypocrisy he exposed, whether it was on the left, right, or anywhere else. Next thing you know, he's producing music videos. Not the typical bland Christian fare, but videos so ground-breakingly original they get airplay on MTV. (Yes, kids, MTV started out with an all-music video format.)

After three outstanding albums, Taylor outdid himself with I Predict 1990. Tracks ranged from his trademark satire (I Blew Up the Clinic Real Good, Since I Gave Up Hope I Feel a Lot Better) to cogent questions (What is the Measure of Your Success?) to yearning (Babylon) to hard rocking combined with storytelling (Innocence Lost) to the hauntingly beautiful (Harder to Believe than Not To) and visited numerous unexpected places in between. The video album contains eight of the ten songs on the CD.

I bought I Predict 1990 on CD when it came out in 1987. Its predictions about the next decade proved painfully accurate. I couldn't afford the video album at the time, but I heard and read that it lead to his being so in demand as a producer and director for other artists that he spent more time working on their projects than his own. He became known as a director, stopped making ground-breaking Christian music, and started making mediocre Christian movies.

I found I Predict 1990 - The Video Album used on Amazon. the price was reasonable, so I bought it. It was interesting to see how Steve envisioned the stories behind the songs I knew so well. There are elements here and there that look a bit dated, but compared to other videos made 25 years ago, these videos hold up very well.  I see Steve's talents in these videos. I also see where his movies went wronggreat directing can't save a cheesy story or a bad script. These are not just music set to scenery; each video tells a story that couldn't be completely expressed in music.",1399248000,,2559,4.703125
