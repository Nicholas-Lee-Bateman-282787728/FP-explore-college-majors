i only have one critisicm, as they say the words and sentences chinese writing does appear for it but they don't state if it is traditional or simplified chinese writing. while english subtitles are available, unforetunately pinyin is not provided if parents want to make themselves familiar with the word pronounciations.",1224288000,6,559,4.88421052631579
3048916,5,B0010GWP2Y,"I'm amazed by the quality of this program and it's ability to sustain  children's interest. There is an alternation of scene with a cartoon character, Little Pim a friendly Panda, and scenes made with real people. A succession of little scenes, mostly played by children or babies and some close adults are narrated in a very clear and and friendly voice. A little gap after each word or sentence enable the child to repeat it or keep the sound resonating in her hear. Bright colors and friendly babies and children faces or pet catch their interest.
I'm so thrilled this program exists for such a hard language as Chinese. I've  Majored in Chinese in college and spent over a year in China and I'm  fluent. But when I ear my kids repeating after Little Pim or exchanging a couple of words with my Chinese friends, I have to admit that they already master this hard pronunciation and the tones better than me after so many years of hard work.",1222128000,13,942,4.562130177514793
3048918,4,B0010GWP2Y,"This was purchased for two little ones, ages 2 and 1. The content features Pim, an animated panda, intermixed with footage of children and parents in everyday situations. Basic objects and actions are introduced then repeated several times before being used in simple phrases and sentences. There is a menu option to see English subtitles. It would be great (for adults) if there was also an option to see the Chinese vocabulary spelled out phonetically in English. However, the kids are obviously the target audience and they seem to really enjoy the videos.",1359158400,,559,5.021505376344086
3048919,5,B0010GWP2Y,"My child loves these videos. He's 15 months old. He's been watching them along with Mandarin Elmo dvds since birth. He watches them with extreme interest and gets pretty grumpy if you try to take them away before he's ready. I'm thinking if nothing else, they have to be stimulating his mind. I watched a show about how the synapses in a baby's brain die away if not used very early on, and they lose the ability to learn languages fluently. I'm planning on buying Mandarin Muzzy when he's a little older.",1350691200,,505,4.5
3048920,1,B0010GWP2Y,"1) Ridiculously expensive.
2) The idea is good (showing what's going on and telling what's happening in that foreign language) but telling it in a narrative way was a stupid idea. I wouldn't say stupid IF you would be able to see the person, and her mouth/lip/tongue moves.
3) The toddlers get bored sooooo quickly.
4) It's way too fast for a toddler to memorize the words.
5) Sometimes (even with the drawings) it is not clear where the toddler should focuse. Is it the eyes, the face, the nose...
6) Buy it for yourself, you can follow it easily, stop and rewind it, take notes then it works, but this is not good for a toddler.

I recommend The Journey to the East: Thr River Dragon King and better Ni Hao, Kai-Lan series.",1327622400,7,725,4.41044776119403
3048921,5,B0010GWP2Y,My 1 1/2 year old has watches this video many times and still wants to watch it. Better than most mandarin videos as it includes no english and captures a toddlers attention throughout the program. I bought the three pack and consider it well worth the purchase. $50 dollars cheaper through Amazon.,1320278400,,298,4.75
3048922,5,B0010GWP2Y,I'm a Chinese mom but cannot speak the language. My son is 12 months and watches the DVD once a day and loves it. At the end of each episodes little pim says good bye in Chinese and my son actually waves bye to him. It's also great for the adults.,1302652800,4,247,3.8627450980392157
3048923,3,B0010GWP2Y,"The content is minimal, which I like, but I agree with other reviewers about three points:

1) This is not pure Mandarin, but is a Northern/Beijing accent.  A spoon is a SHOU ZI, not a SHARRRRR, etc.
2) I would like to see a real person's mouth move rather than a cartoon panda, although I understand why they do it with a cartoon for reusability across languages.
3) The sound quality was such that sometimes it was hard to hear which consonant was being spoken.  For this reason I really really wish that in addition to the English subtitles and the Chinese characters on the screen, that they showed the pinyin Romanization of the word on the screen.  That would have been sooo helpful.

If #1 and #3 were resolved, this would be 4 stars.",1297296000,60,741,4.45925925925926
3048924,4,B0010GWP2Y,"I'm quite pleased with this set; it's a great level for our two-year-old twins. It clearly uses the excellent Pimsleur ""Graduated Interval Recall"" method, adapted for small kids. There's a lot of material here, presented in a way that the kids like to watch, though there's only so much you can capture in 3 DVDs and I hope they continue to produce more volumes.

I refrained from giving 5 stars only because I think that there's more that could have been done with the medium. The production seems to have mostly been done from the technical point of view of how to present the material and match it with some visuals. I think that they could involve some more artist types and make the material really ""come to life.""

That aside, however, this is currently the best material for children that's out there, by a long shot.

Seeing someone say the words is also important, and, no, an animated panda does not count.  Maybe this is less important for older kids, but then don't say the dvd is appropriate for babies as well.  I can still use the dvd's for all the positive reasons other reviewers have given, but this seems to me to be a major downside.",1261440000,11,446,4.402439024390244

8237839,2,B0010GWP2Y,"I agree with the criticism voiced by other reviewers of this product.  These Chinese language videos have a lot of faults, such as:
1) it teaches a Beijing/ Northern Chinese accent rather than a more general Chinese accent understandable by most Mandarin Chinese speakers;
2) it lacks English subtitles to create word association between Chinese characters and English words, and
3) it is structured in a boring manner not engaging to my child to continue watching the video.

The gold standard for me in having my child learn another language is Baby Signing Time, as it has taught my child American Sign Language starting at age 3 months.  He still is signing today despite the fact he talks like a machine gun.  :-)  Baby Signing Time was very engaging to my child to learn to sign.  That is because the producers of the product made it fun to learn a new language with music, a good storyline and showing the English word, the sign, and item visually.

As a person who spoke Mandarin to my parents while growing up and worked in China, this is a waste of money.  My child is not interested in the video which makes it useless.  But if he was interested in the video, he would be learning a dialect of Mandarin which would not be universally understood.  I gave this product 2 stars rather than 3 stars because it is more harmful than useful in learning Chinese.

Unfortunately, I do not have an alternative Chinese language product to suggest.  But if I find one, I will be sure to post it here.",1369440000,8,1499,4.552238805970149
8237840,5,B0010GWP2Y,"My husband is a native Mandarin Chinese speaker and he said that the Chinese words and sentences were all accurate.  Other brands that we looked into had totally inaccurate Chinese.  So please please do not allow your child to view Chinese DVDS unless you are certain that the Chinese is accurate.  Chinese is a tonal language so a slight change in tone changes the meaning all together!
Little PIm allows for your child or yourself to learn Chinese with English & Chinese subtitles.  The routines on the DVD are the same as your child's routines.  It is as good as having a native Chinese woman in your home tutoring your child!  My toddler son loves the kids and the cartoons.  It's a great reinforcement to the Chinese language since he only sees his Chinese speaking grandparents once a month.  This product can also be downloaded on the Little PIm website.  I downloaded all 6 of the Chinese DVDS for $80!  The downloads can be cut and pasted into your Itunes account.  This allows you to view the videos onto Ipad, Iphone, & Apple TV.  For those of you with Roku devices, you can view the DVDS on Roku through PLEX.  Best of luck!!!",1368230400,3,1138,4.54679802955665
