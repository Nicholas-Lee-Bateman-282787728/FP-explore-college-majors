8148946,5,B000J3EYSC,Excellent video with all I wanted to see!,1441324800,,41,4.25
8148947,3,B000J3EYSC,A little dated and not in HD.  Looking forward to seeing it in person when we finally get there.  Gondola ride is a must.,1378512000,,121,4.0
8148948,4,B000J3EYSC,"This video was required for a study abroad program to Australia. It was a good high level video to explain the high-lights of Cairns. Great narration, photography and information! Renting was really easy and a good value for the money.",1363046400,,235,4.9
8148949,2,B000J3EYSC,"Video quality of this DVD was extremely poor.  The lighting was off, stagnant photography, and wonderfully grainy.  This should have been a promotional free-bee for the Cairns area.  You should have to pay the $3.95 S&H fee and be done with it.  Appears a rental car group was in the production of this DVD but there were no obvious references to any car renting.  Marginally informative on the Cairns area and attractions.",1174780800,,423,4.819444444444445
