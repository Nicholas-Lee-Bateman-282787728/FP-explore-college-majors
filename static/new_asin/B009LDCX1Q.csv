5347245,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I love this show! Vampire Diaries is probably one of the only reasons I bother to watch television anymore simply because I love the story line. I hate to compare it to Twilight, but the plot to Vampire Diaries is way stronger and more stable than Twilight's books and movies. I have a major dislike for Twilight, and I was skeptical watching a different vampire themed production, but this series has turned out to be one of my favorites. Love it!",1350518400,3,448,4.54320987654321
5347246,5,B009LDCX1Q,vampire diaries are my all time fave shows ever i absolutely love love love it.

5347248,5,B009LDCX1Q,"This show NEVER disappoints!  Season 4 looks to be the best one yet.  I have been a fan from Season 1, Episode 1.  Just enough twists and turns to keep you interested but not so much as to make your head spin.  It's been fun to see how the plot and characters have changed and developed over time.",1350086400,5,297,4.068965517241379
5347249,5,B009LDCX1Q,"The season starts right where it left off and answers in the first episode many of the questions we were left with in the season 3 finale. Will Elena complete the transition and become a vampire? Will she have chosen Damon after remembering everything? What will happen to Tyler and Caroline now that Klaus is possessing Tyler's body? Will Damon kill Rebecca for her part in Elena's death? It is a very satisfying first episode for fans of Team Stefan, not so much for fans of Team Damon. But for fans of TVD who watch the show for all characters and love the high quality and consistency of the writing and acting on this show , it was fantastic.",1350000000,82,647,4.445378151260504
5347290,2,B009LDCX1Q,I love this show and all its  characters. But Alinas character is one of the most aggravating ones in the season. They make her  such a nervous wreck in this season.,1516320000,,165,4.290322580645161

5347400,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I bought all 7 seasons on Blu-Ray and I must say the packaging and the disc qualities are very good.
As a review of the show itself, I grew up watching The Vampire Diaries and I still think it is the best show out there. Especially the first couple of seasons, you will be very addicted and so driven into their world, you will fall in love with characters and hate others, but the plots and twists are just insanely good. Must watch!!",1477612800,,435,4.253012048192771

5347406,5,B009LDCX1Q,Loved this show.  Was a huge buff and angel fan before this glad I manage to find the bluray+DVD+ UltraViolet.  I still think Elena was being a little dirty and knew ahead of time she was gotta dump the sweet brother for the dark and nasty Damon.  Alot of great stuff here but I wish I had more time to watch these shows.  Just got a bunch of supernatural or other cw shows to catch up before the last season of Vampire Diaries show up.,1474761600,,436,4.094117647058823

5347441,1,B009LDCX1Q,"This review is for the item sold by Mediaflix not the season, this season was AWESOME. There is a reason this season from Mediaflix is such a good price. All of their stock may be refurbished items. I say this because I ordered this item twice and both times the case had a cut through the barcode all the way through the cardboard sleeve into the case and through the jacket cover. There was no cut through the shrink wraping or the label over the barcode so these were obviously repackaged after the deliberate damage. If the damage had only been to the cardboard sleeve I wouldn't have had a problem with it since I toss those anyway but I won't accept damaged cases or jacket covers in my collection. Suggest getting this at Best Buy for an undamaged copy.",1470009600,4,760,4.435714285714286

5347445,5,B009LDCX1Q,Love the series but the one thing that is annoying on these discs is that you can't pick the first one and it keeps going to the next.  Each episode ends and goes to the main menu where you have to start all over again.  Same thing if you let the disc sit while taking a break - it won't pick up where you left off in the show.  You have to start all over.,1466553600,,356,3.72

5347588,3,B009LDCX1Q,"This is my least favorite season so far. I stopped watching mid way when it was airing. I cannot stand how Elena is acting like a child. It is really annoying. The morals have completely gone out the window. I am sooo sick of hearing about ""the cure"" that's the only thing that the end of the season has been focused on. There is no romance between anyone which used to be a huge part of the show. I am going to continuing watching in hopes that it gets better. The best element of the show is the characters such as Stephen, Damon, Caroline and Matt. They are the reason I continue to watch and hopefully Elena snaps out of it the next seasons are better.",1447286400,,656,4.214285714285714

5347795,3,B009LDCX1Q,I gave The Vampire Diaries Fourth Season 3 stars because of the quality of the sound. Almost every episode in the set had some kind of glitch in it where it sounded like it would skip. I have seasons 1 through 3 and that didn't happen to them so I'm not sure what was wrong with season 4. I also watched them all on the same computer so it wasn't an equipment problem on my end. Other than the sound quality the acting and story line was awesome as usual. If I had purchased this item at a store as a boxed set of DVD's I would have returned it because of the quality. I will still order season 5 but I hope it's quality is better than season 4.,1425081600,,645,3.9692307692307693

5348163,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I like this season because things took a darker turn (although TVD has always been dark which I like). The interaction between Elena and Katherine is great this season. I love having Blu-Ray discs of the show because they look so much better than streaming. I also love the fact I can binge my favorite show with no commercials and if you know TVD you know there are a LOT of commercials. So, if you are new to TVD - get started. This show will not disappoint. Season 4 is action filled and gives you many new angles to explore in character development.

5348330,3,B009LDCX1Q,"Season 4 just had WAY TOO MUCH going on. It just couldn't seem to stay focused on any storyline. And it seemed to contradict itself and the previous seasons several times. It's like the writers would just change the history or the ""rules"" whenever they needed it to fit with the current story. Heck, they couldn't even decide on how to pronounce the name, ""Ketsia"".  Giving the Originals their own show should help thin things out a bit. I bought this as a gift for my sister. But my wife and I are still trying to decide if we want to purchase it for ourselves. We probably will just because we have the other seasons. But I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this one. Season 5 has been better. Guess they all can't be winners!",1391817600,,725,4.330882352941177

5348358,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I totally agree with your descriptions of the the first four seasons. I just loved the first 3 seasons and very disappointed in the fourth. I knew exactly where they were going when the started this love triangle between the three main characters. I knew eventually that Elena would become a vampire and I think that really kind of ruined it for me. What made it special was the fact of a compassionate love between Vampire and Human. Don't understand why writers always do that. There are other ways to expand on the actors wanting to do more and evolve. If they don't like the characters they are doing and get bored, then just leave the show. Now it appears that Elena is just another actor and nothing special. She's just like all the others. Let's pay Stefan and Damon, Drink lots of blood, and kill if need be. Oh, let's not have to much humanity. I think it would have been better if she stayed with Stefan. Can you imagine the true love, compassion!!! Why not find another lady friend for Damon that they could explore and embellish on. Guess I'll stop for now. Very disappointed in the direction the show is taking. There's hardly and humans left. It's all about a love trianle. Damon doesn't compare to stefan. I don't see any real romance in him with Elena. It's more of a lust. It's turning into just another usual Vampire TV show.

5348384,3,B009LDCX1Q,"This show is admittedly a guilty pleasure for me. Unfortunately, Season 4 was my least favorite season. It wasn't as fast paced as Season 3, so I was a bit let down. The story arc wasn't quite as interesting either. But obviously it was good enough for me gobble up every episode rather quickly. The story lines dragged on and on, while also skipping details that could have made it interesting. This season also lacked the cliffhangers from episode to episode. I've continued to watch the show, it's just that this season was not as good as the others. So while it wasn't great, it wasn't all bad either.",1389484800,,605,4.559633027522936

5348416,5,B009LDCX1Q,"This is my all time favorite show. I just ordered it on Friday, with a Christmas Visa gift card, and according to tracking, it should arrive tomorrow. This season is probably my least favorite of the 5 seasons, because it started a bit slow....but about mid season, it picked up again and became TVD that we all know and love!!!! Who could forget Klaus dripping in Hybrid blood in the Christmas episode?? Or Damon and Elena FINALLY getting together one very steamy night? The introduction of Stefan's doppelganger? Learning that Katherine was not the first doppelganger? Seeing Elena slaughter innocent ppl? Matt's face when he saw Jeremy dead on the bed? Bonnie dying to bring Jeremy back to life? Seeing the gang graduate....watching Klaus behead a witch (that was back from the dead) right b4 they killed Caroline....Damon talking at Alaric's grave, and more importantly, Damon and Alaric's reunion....and, at the end, Elena finally choosing the RIGHT brother, the very sexy Damon....so many good moments!!!! And when it arrives tomorrow, I can't wait to rewatch the entire season and ALL the special features!!! I already own seasons 1-3, and have watched them so often, I'm surprised I haven't worn the DVD's out!!! I can't wait to own season 5, the season on air right now.....its shaping up to be possibly the best season yet!!! And getting season 4 tomorrow is the perfect (and only) thing that will make this oh so very long ""mid season break"" bearable!!! Why do they have to have a 6-week break in the middle of the season??? I remember when shows would break for the week of Christmas and New Years, but return the next week....I dunno how I'll make it until Jan 23.....oh yea, I do!!!! Watch season 4!!!!! And then maybe start all over again with the pilot episode through season 5 episode 10 (I have this whole season to date on my DVR and my boyfriend knows the punishment of erasing even 1 episode is DEATH)!!!!!! So, I can't wait!!!! This is really the best show on tv, so full of twists and turns, cliff hangers, love, sex, death, passion....God, such a great show!!!!",1388361600,,2085,4.762430939226519
5348417,4,B009LDCX1Q,"Well well well another depressing season - Hahaha. It was just so boring and depressing I had to turn it off on disc 4. Which was nearly the end. The quality and the extra little features are a nice perk. My gripe is about the show - Oh how I wish I was writing for it and could make some changes - much needed. Elena - The eternal victim - human and even vampire. Bonnie - Annoying but tragic in a way. Caroline - MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER. Tyler - Eh.... Matt- Eh.... Klaus - Mmm-hmmm! ;) Stefan - Still <3 him; the brooding and the hair. Damon - hot diggity dang. Katherine - I like her waaaaaaaaay better than Elena, yet they are played by the same actress. Hahaha - its interesting; just means she is a pretty decent actor. :) The set was well packaged and the discs are neat in the plastic casing. I just took one star off for the damn storyline - which was so depressing. LOL!",1388361600,,880,4.152046783625731

5348454,1,B009LDCX1Q,Okay I'm sorry but this show is so sad it makes twilight looks amazing. Season 4 of the vampire diaries is now looking like breaking dawn part 2. Elena is a vampire I saw that from season 3 episode 1. Like I said this is trash stop with all the 5 star reviews this stupid little fake ass sjow would never be without L.J. Smith's books once again all L.J. Smith's vampire diaries are way better the show is turning into a really sad twilight knock off.,1383955200,,451,4.195402298850575
5348455,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I do not know what it is, but this series used to literally hold my attention like crazy. Perhaps it was the damon/elena love story that so appeared to want to hatch and yet never did, and it kept you wanting it, begging for them to come together as one... and then maybe when they did, it lost that connection, that yearning is missing. So... that story was beginning to hatch with klaus and caroline, and you will watch that vanish due to him leaving at the very end for his own series... which I love... however, without klaus I do not see how season 5 will survive.
But beyond that season 4 was like watching my favorite show slip, and I can almost sense an ending coming, which of course saddens me.

This season was not awful, but it felt forced.",1383868800,,752,4.295774647887324

5348516,4,B009LDCX1Q,"I love the Vampire Diaries and have been watching since the first season. First two seasons the show was building its character, as well as the actors. Season three was when it truly came together. Season five is on the CW now, and though it has changed with Caroline and Elena off at college the dynamics are the same. However season five is all about Delena, whereas seasons three and before where about Elena and Stefan. If you enjoy supernatural shows about vampires, werewolves, and witches this is one which does so with young adults, other shows don't do so well as this for the young adult audience. Also Caroline and Tyler arc is getting tired. The original vampires featured in season four, however since they have their own show they probably won't be taking up much of season five. Katherine a prominent figure, though, in season five has been given the cure and is vulnerable as a human. Since season five just started the season is developing itself, it started off well but needs a plot twist soon, relying on Stefan's memories as he is trapped while Silas impersonates him.",1381708800,,1089,4.706806282722513

5348522,5,B009LDCX1Q,"From the first season this show, is a show with twists and action-packed episodes, its not a chick-flick even though it has some romance in it, its mostly action and twists.

The fourth season was better than expected, so awesome that I wish it could have 23 more episodes to watch...I would recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of series...",1381622400,,347,4.596774193548387

5348525,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I have been watching this show since the Pilot episode back in September 2009. I have to admit, nerdishly, that I have NOT missed a single episode in the last four (4), well, now beginning, five (5), years. Every summer, I wait eagerly, (and shamelessly,) for September/October to arrive, making my own imaginative scenarios for the new season... I freely admit that I am a Vampire Diaries junkie. I love ""True Blood"" and ""Twilight"" (the books MUCH MORE than the movies,) but The Vampire Diaries is not even in the same league, to me. In between seasons, I've kept myself busy reading and re-reading L.J. Smith's ""The Vampire Dairies"" books; ""Shadow Souls"" is by far my favorite, and I've lost count the number of times that I've re-read it; although I am also a fan of the TVD inspired books ""Stefan's Diaries"" series. I love how I get to indulge in reading about my favorite characters whilst I become enthralled at the completely different storyline. Of course, for those of us who HAVE read all the original four (4) books,(""The Awakening"", ""The Struggle"", ""The Fury"", and ""Dark Reunion""), as well as the resurrected and re-vamped (pun intended) books that L.J. Smith has so graciously written for us die-hard fans: *THE RETURN* :: ""Nightfall"", ""Shadow Souls"", ""Midnight""; then *THE HUNTERS* :: ""Phantom"", ""Moonsong"", ""Destiny Rising""... And the ""novellas"", of sorts, loosely based on the Vampire Diaries TV show on the CW: *Stefan's Diaries* ~ ""Originis"", ""Bloodlust"", ""The Craving"", ""The Ripper"", ""The Asylum"", ""The Compelled"" ~ the latter books written in collaboration by L.J. Smith, Kevin Williamson, and Julie Plec",1381449600,,1624,5.063432835820896

I never watched it while it was actually airing on T.V so I always waited and bought the DVD set when it came out. The last 3 seasons I finished very quickly but this last season it took me awhile to finish. It wasn't that I didn't like it because I did but it was the lack of keeping me interested until the 4th disc. I really hope season 5 will be better and won't be so different because of Klaus, Rebehka, and Elijah won't be on it due to them having their own spin off maybe they will make guest appearances. All in all I am glad I purchased the Series it's a nice addition to the collection.",1380672000,2,720,4.041958041958042

Elena's trite and ongoing sympathetic looks along with the run of the mill human associations make the show boring. Thank goodness that the producers developed the other characters. She can no longer carry the show and I would rather watch the show without her. Stefan's character is becoming stale as well, and Bonnie is getting ther. In short, the orignial cast need to be replaced. Only, Damon and Klaus (sometimes Rebekah) are the worthwhile reasons to watch.",1380499200,2,585,5.168421052631579

Damien is my favorite but quite honestly I'm getting sick of Elaina's character. She is like watching a bad soap opera now. It's just the same thing over and over.

5348713,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I LOVE Vampire Diaries.  The 4th season was great.  This review is for the combo pack itself.  I have been growing my UV collection and have been only buying movies and shows with UV codes lately.  I generally watch my UV collection  through the VUDU on my TV.  So, I decided to spend a little more to get the version with the UV code.  Well, that was pointless.  It seems the only place with the proper license to allow access to the UV copy is Flixster.  I have no issues with Flixster, but you can't watch your collection anywhere but online or on a mobile app.  I contacted VUDU and MGO.  Neither have the license to let you access the UV copy of the show through their apps.  I did not contact Cinema Now, but it's not available there either.  I assume that's for the same reason.  Both VUDU and MGO said they may get the license in the future.  But, it's not available now and, they don't know when it will be.  I assumed season 4 would be easily accessible through VUDU since season 3 was.  But, it's not.  So, don't waste the extra money if your main reason is for the UV access.  It's not worth it.  I did also write to WB to complain about the lack of UV outlets that they've given license to.  Maybe if more people do the same, that will help.  So, if you want digitial access for your television through a smart tv or other smart device, I suggest you buy it straight from a source like VUDU, who, ironically, does have the license to let you buy the season through them.",1378512000,,1483,4.2214285714285715

5348748,4,B009LDCX1Q,"everyone is caught up in IAN;s steamy affair w Nina but that's because in real life they are a couple and if you follow their real live , their acting together ONLY became layered and more REAL with moments that were memorable ONCE that hooked up in real life.

DUE TO PAUL'S ACTING CHOPS , he started the SERIES W His INTRO monologue and it was HIS INTERST LOVE for ELena that WE ALL FELL FOR , even after evil Damon showed up.

Lets be real. We wanted him to get Katherine back not ELENA.  PAUL has the acting training to turn each plot twist BELEIVABLE which is the job. Whether he had to save Damon by being Klau's side kick as a ripper for a season, or the slow well played difficult self punishing way he played out his return to his less evil self that his acting training allowed him to know ONE KISS OF DEATH TO AVOID< NEVER PLAY ALL ONE NOTE!

AS IAN DOES many times. YES DAMON is the bad boy BUT no person had one layer to their personality and IAN lazily played that evil note to boredom till they wrote in his turn of interest to Elena once thinking Katherine wasn't in tomb.

His moment that SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SHOW STOPPER WAS WHEN ALARIC WAS DYING. IAN THE ACTOR BLEW IT.

There in that scene ,  he had ,over the  seasons truly befriended this one Human.

So HE Blew the Chance all actors yearn for, the chance to play a new color or layer to their established ""expected"" bad boy character.

He should have dug in ,reached deep and shown humanity because at that time,  he and Rick were closer than he and his own Brother!

Cmon Ian !
What a memorable scene that would been to see Damon flip a bit and he shed a tear over ROSE whom he met for 2 days!!

BUT not for ALARIC whom saved Damon so many times despite him killing turning his wife!

We have seen Caroline, (accola) Grow so so much and Matt and Jeremy, but /IAn Damon is stuck on middle C , over time greta thing about episodic TV principal roles is you get a chance to grow in your role.

Hes the same Damon all 4 seasons, except from switching his obsession from Katherine to Elena.

whereas in Pauls acting we have seen the pain of her rejection and feel  it.

We feel /see Bonnies fear of her own power and her joy too. Caroline turned from whiner to heroine many times and is strong on any plot thrown at her .

PAUL carries the show , as he started it out and I believe he and ELENA need to reunite before its over, or I will consider the show a waste if she chooses Damon.

As Damon has told her  , ""stop trying to make me into Stefan , ill never be him""  And its true,

 Pauls talent will lead to many film roles when done.

Ian seems unfocused, as model -turned actor shows.  Look at Joe Morgan's training  and work...I bet it was Actors studio or Meisner, and Elijah's too, .

Seems we are under a Brit invasion in prime time , Jax of FX Sons of Anarchy a Brit also.

Our best talent is hailing lately from UK acting w/ American accents done very well. Even in True  Blood.

Sookies brother Jason (Chris Bauer) his accent is brilliant as a good ole boy in LA,  I was amazed to hear his thick Brit accent when he sounds more authentically southern than southerners are,

Elena is great as 2 roles but should be careful that her vampire self,  doesn't take on too much of Katherine style or the opposing characterizations she worked hard to create will be ruined.

 WE need Elena to somehow stay  w humanity as a vampire , or the 2 will become one , inevitably,  if  writers keep Nina playing humanity off too long,  she will lose the differentials with Katherine and blend , she worked hard to create that It would ruin the show if that happened

Id like to Ian Evolve to where his work is as varied as his one liners.

love the show.

Stefan and Elena as a couple I totally bought and fell for but Elena and
Damon other than the physcail scenes which have reality as a couple in life behind them to add the steam..i don't buy into them as a good fit on show.",1378166400,,3942,4.1519154557463676

5348865,3,B009LDCX1Q,I have been enjoying this series. This last season was a bit disappointing perhaps because they focused less on the romantic leads and classic love story of the first few seasons and perhaps because this was also setting up the spin off; The Originals.,1375315200,,252,4.75
5348866,4,B009LDCX1Q,Slow at times but overall a great season! This was not my favorite season but I enjoyed seeing how the characters developed as the season progressed. The season gets better in the second half so don't give up on it after the first few episodes.,1375315200,,244,4.444444444444445

However, I started watching it again randomly, and once I got over the fact that it is ridiculous by nature, I found myself really enjoying it, especially the fourth season. I am huge fan of Damon's character and this season did him justice. Also, I think originally I was just tired of Elana always being the victim and constantly crying and everyone dying for her and this season changed that in a good and entertaining way. If you're into vampires, the supernatural in general and love stories, this is probably for you.",1374624000,2,671,4.508196721311475

The characters just kept getting better with each episode. With other shows that are similar, you can pretty much guess what will happen; NOT in the Vampire Diaries; it keeps you guessing the whole time.",1374451200,,362,4.671875

5348916,5,B009LDCX1Q,Crazy about this show - the fourth season fosters an astrominomical change for the series and it's characters introducing new obstacles AND a spin off (The Originals).  This season might be a little harder to get through.,1374192000,2,221,4.972972972972973

5348930,5,B009LDCX1Q,Finally Elena and Damon get together and what a hot combo. Makes sense they show such great chemistry on screen since they were dating in real life during the filming. Writers are doing a great job keeping this series interesting. Hope the series continues. Definitely not just another tweeny vampire love triangle story.,1373932800,,321,5.0754716981132075

5348959,5,B009LDCX1Q,"The fourth season of TVD was AMAZING. If you're a fan of the show, this season still has all the horror, mystery, twists and the endless love triangle. But what made this season so special was Elena's transition as a vampire (I was looking forward to see how that change would affect everyone), and it made it so interesting. There was not a boring episode this season, and a lot of things (sad and happy things) happen, so be ready if you haven't seen the season, because the unexpected twists make you wanting more and more of this show!

I just think that The Vampire Diaries is one of the best supernatural shows on TV right now. If you love a mix between horror, love and mystery, this show is for you. And I can't wait to get this set! The bonus features look great, and I'm looking forward for season 5, and The Originals too!

Update (09/14):
Now that I bought the DVD, I was so excited for the bonus features, they all sounded really interesting and they ended up being that and more! The featurettes show the most important things that happened during the season with commentaries of the cast and crew, they were really great made. The other bonus features like the gag reel, deleted scenes and the fan features were great as well. The quality of video and audio is amazing as usual!",1373500800,,1293,4.451476793248945

5349018,5,B009LDCX1Q,I was hooked on this series by the 3rd episode of season one. Good characters and story lines. I look forward to season five-at least there better be a season five.,1371945600,,164,4.32258064516129
5349029,5,B009LDCX1Q,"This is the only ep of the season I downloaded, because I don't want to wait until the DVD comes out in order to be able to re-watch it. I have loved TVD since it started, and I'm a fan of all the main characters like Damon and Stefan. But the Originals, especially Elijah and Klaus, have just become my absolute faves! Especially Elijah. I absolutely adore Daniel Gillies, and I love how towards the beginning of this ep we got a bit of a throwback to the ""old"" super-powerful, scary, badass Elijah, ripping out hearts. That was awesome! That being said, I am super excited about the new spin-off series! This episode, in my opinion, was one of the best-written and had the best atmosphere of any in a long time. And I say that with no disrespect to TVD, because I will always love that show passionately. Ep 20 has ""the big twist"" that upset many people, with Klaus and Hayley, but I think it has the potential to be a VERY interesting storyline. Can't wait to see what happens next in New Orleans!",1371859200,,1000,4.381720430107527
5349030,2,B009LDCX1Q,"I have watched TVD from the moment it premiered. The show was showing signs of going downhill with season three, but it was not bad enough for me not to buy it on DVD like I did with the other previous seasons. This season I'm not going to waste the money, I came out watching the season as though I totally wasted my time when I could have watched something better, but throughout the season I was hoping that it would get better, but it didn't, it just got gradually worse.

The most appalling for me (Spoiler) is the death of Bonnie! They sacrifice her so they can bring Jeremy back? whose not even a character in the books. I like Jeremy, but I like Bonnie better, and getting rid of her was a dumb move, and I'm not the only one who thinks this.

Season 4 was mixture of crappy plotlines, recycled plotlines- nothing in this season was original at all. Some of the plotlines have all been used before. No Character development. I recommend if you have forty bucks to spend, not waste it on buying this, buy something you like, this would definitely be a buyers remorse.",1371772800,3,1074,4.365

5349032,5,B009LDCX1Q,i REALLY WAS ENTERTAINED BY THIS SEASON WITH ALL OF THE TWISTS AND TURNS! THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO SPEND A RAINY DAY!,1371686400,,115,3.8333333333333335
5349033,5,B009LDCX1Q,"SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED STARTING IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH. In my opinion, the third season got a little offtrack, so I was nervous about what season four would be like. Typically, the fourth season of a series is when it begins to stumble a little bit (hi there, Buffy), but, in my opinion, that wasn't the case at all for TVD. It is in TVDS4 that the show has really hit its stride... and without Kevin Williamson, which is a feat in and of itself. Don't listen to the hate. This season is the best (just an OOMPH above the second, which I thought would always be my favorite) of the series, specifically because the amazingness that encases episodes 4x14-4x23. Okay, yes, some episodes at the beginning feel a little slow, but they're just planting the seeds for the absolute awesome that comes about halfway through. Not only does TVDS4 feature one of the most radical, unforeseen character transformations ever, it also comes with one of the best season finales you'll ever see and one of the most devastating TV episodes to ever air, ""Stand By Me,"" 4x15. This is really the season of destroying Elena's life and showing off how incredible an actress Miss Nina Dobrev is... No one cries like her. No one. Ever.

It's also, at last, the big season for Delena fans. Though I was once a Stelena shipper, Delena won me over sometime in the third season, and I've loved their undeniable chemistry ever since. That said, the Delena storyline is probably why a lot of reviewers are ""downvoting"" this season. The sire bond infuriated many because it meant Damon and Elena couldn't immediately stroll off into a glorious sunset, but, really, that would have been boring. When have things EVER been easy for TVD romances? Oh! That's right... Never. Of course, Elena and Damon do get their happy ending in the finale, and it is BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, why do all good Delena moments happen in front of that fireplace or on Elena's (now quite gone) front porch? But anyway...

Besides the sire bond, people also complained about the cure storyline. Personally, I find this amusing. In TVDS3, people complained that the story was too choppy and all over the place. They said the season didn't really have a specific story that it was telling, like the second did. Well, TVDS4 remedied that... and people were bold enough to whine that the season had a specific story it was telling and got tired of it. I swear, I love this show, but the fandom never ceases to infuriate me.

My favorite part of the season, as I said earlier, was the aftermath of Jeremy's death. Elena turning off her emotions was incredible and exactly what TVD needed to do. Though I liked Elena, I had grown a little tired of her and was slightly disappointed that becoming a vampire hadn't really tested her morals. And then the TVD writers basically told me to shut up and threw at me a storyline so amazing I couldn't even handle my life. Bad Elena was, in my humble opinion, the highlight of season 4... especially whenever she was with Katherine (my favorite character). 4x18, 4x21, 4x22, and especially 4x23 featured brilliant Elena/Katherine scenes that really showed off how tremendously talented Miss Dobrev is.

Well, I guess my ramble is over. I could go into how much I love Klaroline, how excited I am for the Originals spinoff (oh, the baby... that's another story I love that some people are whining about... But, let's be real, when have the TVD writers EVER done a story that didn't turn out to be full-fledged awesomeness? Never. That's when.), but Teen Wolf is about to come on and I love it so. #sterek",1371427200,,3579,4.6761904761904765

Initially, my wife brought it to my attention and it came off more of a Twilight clone (but on warner bros), but after the first few episodes of season 1, I discovered it was it's own animal.

5349102,2,B009LDCX1Q,"So, despite the monumental disappointment of season 3, I decided to give this show another chance because back in season 1 and season 2, it was such a fantastic show.

Well, sad to say, but this season was a million times worse.

Character development was thrown out the window along with relationship development. To be honest, I'm legitimately confused at the shift from Stelena to Delena because it was not developed well this season at all and it left me wondering what I missed. And the characters? Yikes. Everyone's development was tossed out and so many character were unbelievably dumbed down this season.

As usual, characters were killed off. However, this time they weren't killed off with a purpose. They were simply killed off for shock value, which shows just how downhill this show has become.

There were some small highlights of this season such as Kol's brief storyline (which, in my opinion, should have lasted longer) and Bonnie's storyline. Everything else was either boring and disjointed and made no sense.

All I can say is that unless this show gets a major overhaul, some new and better writers, and a new and better executive producer, it's simply not worth watching anymore.",1370217600,3,1202,4.930693069306931

5349107,1,B009LDCX1Q,"This season was very disappointing. It was very disjointed. The mythology was all over the place and never did make any sense. The heroine is no longer a ""heroine"". She was reduced to a prop for a ship and all of her morals were stripped. At this point she was more of an anti-hero. This was not the Elena that we have grown to love. She was acting very childish the entire season. Stefan became a background character and Damon only whined about his ""main-pain"" over not getting the girl and not being chosen the ENTIRE season.

If you loved the first 2 seasons it is unlikely that you will like this season. There was no moral compass at all. There was nothing to really route for. The sire bond and cure story lines were the worst in the series yet. No viewer would be rooting for our hero's. The main character has no free will yet her view point was ignored. If you prefer darker vampire stories you might like this season better than the others. I have loved the vampire diaries to obsession level. This season not only turned me off from buying it on DVD but also from the entire series in the future. I wish I didn't watch this season. I'd rather have it erased from my memory so it doesnt taint the show for me.

Delena fans: If you are a delena fan and don't care about the integrity of their love story (as many who are delena fans did not like how they were protrayed this season) then you might love this season.

Stelena fans: If you are a stelena fan I recommend buying 4x01 and making that the end, because that was a better than anything they can do in the future at this point.

Non Shippers or ""Elena"" fans: If you aren't a ""shipper"", but didn't really like S3, then you definitely won't like this season. If you preferred Season 3 over S1 then you ""might"" like it. The series is definitely going down hill with character development.

Lastly, what they have reduced woman to in this story is disgusting and I can't believe a woman wrote it. If you cant stand woman having to be controlled by their men that ""know better"" because they ""love you"" then you are going to hate this season.",1369958400,14,2104,4.343511450381679

I imagine that season 5 might be able to pick up the slack since they won't be as tied to the town and the whole high school drama. However, as good as this show has been, I suspect it has reached the point of a downward spiral. All great shows eventually do, it seems. Unless they add new characters, I just don't really see what more they could possibly do without it seeming forced. I still recommend this season, just don't start with it. If you're just trying this show out, start with season one and give it a few episodes to pick up.

5349148,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I want to start out by saying that I believe the first three seasons of ""The Vampire Diaries"" are absolutely phenomenal. This season, however, came as something of a disappointment. The first stumbling block came in the premiere episode in which the cliffhanger of Klaus having possessed Tyler was resolved way too quickly. There was an awful lot of potential in that storyline that just wasn't realized. Then, there's Elena becoming a vampire. It all started out well enough, only for another stellar idea to not be developed properly. Not to mention the contradictions of her sire bond to Damon. It all became a very frustrating experience to watch. Exactly what was the purpose of the new character, April? She flitted from episode to episode without any real purpose, only to be forgotten about altogether. Another missed opportunity was this season's MacGuffin: the vampire cure. When the cure was finally obtained, why did no one think to hand it over to Dr. Meredith Fell and have her attempt to synthesize more of it? Despite this season's many flaws, the talented ensemble cast never gave less than 100% throughout. I only wish they'd been given better material to work with. I'll definitely be buying the DVD release. Only I'm not sure if it will be as re-watchable as the previous seasons.",1369440000,18,1300,4.913636363636364

Funny thing is that I couldn't help but ""check in"" at various times to see what the characters were up to - I'd get upset when they did dumb things and cheer when they resolved them.  I finally had to admit that I was hooked and went back to Season 1, episode 1 and caught up to her (3 seasons) in 3 weeks!

5349234,3,B009LDCX1Q,"WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (but hopefully not too many major ones).

DISCLAIMER: I do actually like this show and plan on sticking with it, because I'm OCD and must see things through to the end. That being said, every show has a bad season - Buffy had the snooze-fest of season four, Angel had the truly terrible baby plot line in season three, Smallville had a dull-as-dishwater-Zod in season nine, and ... well, this is TVD's bad season. (I hope, because it's a mess and I'd hate to sit through another one.) The thing is, when the show is good, it's really good, and when it's bad, it's incredibly bad.

Watching this season reminded me of reading ""Breaking Dawn."" It started out promising then turned into total crap, but I kept reading hoping for the EPIC RESOLUTION that would make up for 500 pages of self-defeating, totally illogical bull that preceded it. Lo and behold, instead of an epic resolution, I got 40 pages of pontificating and vampires standing around glaring at each other, before everyone went home; a big buildup, the promise of epic violence, and ... no payoff.

In a nutshell, this is how season four of ""The Vampire Diaries"" plays out: a promising start, an epic build-up, some decent character moments, the threat of deathly peril and then... total crap. Not only is the pacing way off (long gone are the days of the series actually being creepy, and having episodic cliffhangers), it breaks all its formerly-established ""vampire rules,"" spends way too much time on unimportant things and not enough on its villain, introduces pointless characters for one or two episodes rather than using and developing existing ones, and the finale, while ""good,"" is so rushed, I felt most of it SHOULD have been a three or four episode arc at the end of the season.

The wasted opportunities this season are endless, particularly the finale: the writers bring back a bunch of vengeful hybrids, werewolves, vampires, and dead witches, and you don't really see them DO ANYTHING BAD in town! Where's the hell-raising Kol promised us? Where's him capturing Elena and torturing her for days? Where's Klaus having to face down his twelve angry, undead, can't-be-killed hybrids? It's a MAJOR LET DOWN, and worse, a missed opportunity. Sadly, it didn't shock me because the entire season is like that.

Breaking established ""rules of the universe"" in a series (or book, for that matter) is lazy, sloppy, and convenient, the epitome of bad writing. Here, they do it multiple times - baby vampires get the upper hand on much older ones (including an Original), a hybrid-werewolf baby is conceived, the sire bond isn't as rare as they said, and for that matter, neither are doppelgangers. Relationships are convenient rather than developed; characters are underused; consistently, the writers promise us something great and fail to deliver. Kol promises us hell on earth if Silas is freed - it never arrives; Klaus promises vengeance for Kol - it doesn't happen; Klaus swears vengeance on Tyler - and does nothing.

None of the originals care when one of them is killed - and Elijah even goes so far as to comfort his brother's murderer, with nary a mention of his senseless death (and no, the show's justification is invalid, since there's a witch in Mystic Falls capable of stopping Kol). The writers then have him turn around a few episodes later and spend half of an episode trying to convince Klaus how important it is to preserve family. (WUT?)

Granted, it all doesn't suck, and the first half of the season is even good. There's a few standout episodes, such as the aftermath of the Jeremy plot twist. Klaus' presence in the Christmas episode is unforgettable. Elijah continues to be fabulous, particularly when turning up in New Orleans. Damon and Elena have a nice moment together in the finale. Plus, it included the pilot episode for ""The Originals,"" which between Elijah (who, me, biased? Never!) and Marcel (who out-awesome-s Klaus by ten million miles) may be a lot of fun next fall.

Will I be watching it next season? Yes. I didn't give up on Buffy, Angel, or Smallville after their crappy seasons. Hopefully, this is just a stumble and not an indication of the future of the series, because in spite of its faults, I do like ""The Vampire Diaries""... and I want to see it get back on form.

Or at least have some sort of a PLAN next season.",1368662400,81,4373,4.796812749003984

Amazon has a wide variety of items that all of us can use, as well as the new and current movies and streaming movies. We have been doing business with them for several years with no problems.

5349276,2,B009LDCX1Q,"No character development, no interesting plot, keep watching it just because I have watched the previous seasons. I think the show started out great but it is one of the worst now...",1368144000,9,182,4.71875
5349297,4,B009LDCX1Q,"I really hope elana and damon end up together , would be the best cause he truly loves her and really was used by Katherine from the beginning",1368144000,,142,4.107142857142857
5349298,5,B009LDCX1Q,LOVE THIS SHOW...Getting better every episode. Can;t wait to watch the next one.  Good bonding time for me and my daughter,1368144000,,122,4.809523809523809
5349299,4,B009LDCX1Q,The show continues to change and grow its characters in numbers and depth. The continuing changing allows the show to stave off becoming stale.,1368144000,,143,5.0
5349300,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I really like this show and got into all the different characters. I'm also a sucker for a good love triangle. Some of the story lines kind of dragged on and some of the writing is very obvious (I don't know how many times in the fourth season the words humanity switch are used, but you could make a drinking game out of it for sure).",1368144000,,335,4.090909090909091
5349301,5,B009LDCX1Q,I love this show. It's addicting. I read the original group of books before it began and fell in love with the characters. The shower is different but very suspenseful. It always keeps me guessing. I love this show for the awesome character development and the sexiness!!,1368144000,,271,4.787234042553192
5349302,5,B009LDCX1Q,I enjoy the multiple story lines that are occurring at the same time.  Keeps me coming back each and every week.,1368057600,,112,4.333333333333333
5349303,5,B009LDCX1Q,I am a huge Twilight fan.. and for the longest time I would not look it Vampire Diaries ( lol loyal fan) but after watching the very first episode of the first season I was Hooked. I purchase each season 1-3 from Amazon instant video and could not wait until season 4 came out.,1368057600,,277,4.148148148148148
5349304,5,B009LDCX1Q,I really love the series but I am very much in love with all of the characters. So when one gets a bum rap them I get a little huffy. I know it makes for a good story though. So if this happens to you I recommend not watching for a few weeks and then watch back to back episodes. Gives you a better appreciation for what they are doing in the season and is much easier for me to endure the characters' issues if I can see more at a time. Silly I know but I love a good story and I hate having to stop watching when some 'cliff hanger' is at the end. Enjoy.,1368057600,,556,3.7606837606837606
5349305,5,B009LDCX1Q,My daughter is addicted to this show. We were able to buy a couple of episodes she missed so she could catch up. Glad to have this option available. I've done it with another show as well.,1367971200,,188,4.108108108108108

5349307,1,B009LDCX1Q,This video was not up to standards of streaming.  It was very blurry throughout the video and took about 3 hours to watch 45 minutes.  This was a waste of money.,1367798400,,161,4.161290322580645

5349310,5,B009LDCX1Q,Season 4 is full of new vampire crazies. Damon is still delicious and Elena is interesting. I still hope that Caroline and Klaus get together. And Elena and Damon have vampire babies lol.,1367712000,,187,4.696969696969697

5349314,3,B009LDCX1Q,"The teenage angst and drama is getting a little old for me now after 4 seasons. Although I expect that a story like this one couldn't last very long without needing a complete change in strategy.

*SPOILER ALERT*

I think I finally lost interest when the writers decided to kill one of the more compelling characters in the story. I understand that it's been part of the MO since the beginning to not hang onto loved characters, but this time I think they went just a tad to far (or maybe we just got so attached to Jer that it hurt all that worse to see him go).

Plus the promise of new and exciting stories via The Originals has me intrigued.

Honestly, I think it's time for a makeover for TVD now.",1367625600,,702,4.2556390977443606
5349315,5,B009LDCX1Q,Love the series.  Love that it's produced in Georgia.  Fun ride.  Lots of pretty people.  Lots of excitement.  If you like fantasy you'll love The Vampire Diaries.,1367625600,,163,4.888888888888889

5349327,3,B009LDCX1Q,Stefan and damons obsession with elenas well being is really starting to wear thin. decent side plot development with bonnies new skills but the overarching problem of silus' goal is a little soap opera-y for me. strangely I am actually finding myself liking claus - kudos to vd given I have to guess that was the point right? elenas 'new' character development is also so bad it continually reminds me i am watching a show - which for me is disappointing.,1367625600,3,456,4.6419753086419755
5349328,5,B009LDCX1Q,"Best season so far. The characters as we know them from previous seasons are changing, especially Elena. Relationships are evolving and everyone is challenged to see friends & foes in a different light.
Great transitional season as we prepare to watch them leave high school (finally, they're as old as teachers at this point- I'm looking at you Caroline) and head to college.",1367625600,,376,4.984126984126984
5349329,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I just want to comment on the BRILLANCE that is Nina Dobrev!! Her portrayals of Elena (human) Elena (vampire, with and without humanity) and Katherine are truly unbelievable!! She switches from character to character and never misses a beat! I sometimes forget she is the same actress playing Elena and Katherine. This is truly one of the best series ever and I find myself waiting impatiently for each week's episode and feeling ""lost"" when it is on any hiatus. Which is why I buy each season every year~ I always am able to get my ""fix"". I am always pleased with the speed of processing and delivery that I get ordering from Amazon and have never had a problem with any DVD I have ordered from them. If you are a fan, invest in your own copies, if you have never experienced the GENIUS that is TVD~ you are missing out! Oh, and lest I forget, endless scenes of Ian Somerhalder are a BONUS!!",1367539200,,892,4.445121951219512

However, I will have to say that the 4th season was not as strong the previous seasons.  I seems as if the story line is getting a little lost and confused.  Will still continue to watch for the next season.",1367452800,,325,4.366666666666666

5349377,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I've been hooked on TVD from the beginning, when I first watched the ""vampire show"" on Netflix (thank goodness for Netflix, or I'd never have seen it!). Then I later got Amazon Video, so it helps me feed my TVD addiction on a weekly basis.  It really has been a wonderful, compelling adventure. Season 4 has been, in my opinion, a journey through growing pains--not just for Elena, who has had to endure all that comes along with being a vampire, losing the last of her family, and saying goodbye to her humanity--but also to Damon and Stefan, who have both felt not only the depth of Elena's love and compassion, but also her wrath in the wake of that missing humanity. Some people get lost in the love triangle and all that entails, but I'm really more about the journey. While I am Team Delena (all the way), I appreciate what Stelena once shared and how important it was to both of them, and to the journey that is affecting all three of them as they move toward the eventual end of the series. No matter how it all ends (or whom Elena ends up with), I will always love these characters and what they endured and how they loved and how they grew...and I'm just going to enjoy the ride that had me at, ""Hello, brother."" TVD is one of my favorite shows of all time (I'm 46, and it's a very short list of favorites), and that's saying a lot.",1367107200,,1342,4.304347826086956

5349384,5,B009LDCX1Q,Great way to stream. Amazon video doesn't have to stop and buffer in the middle of a show. The ease if purchase directly from the blue ray is awesome. I like nice and easy and with prime the shows and movies I can watch free it cool. Of course vampire diaries is a show for pure brain candy. U have to like the show to want to buy episodes.,1367020800,,340,3.9420289855072466

The only problem I have with serialized TV shows is that if they go off the air for  let's say from the first week of December until the end of January, I forget what's happened. What I do now is Tivo everything & Watch the entire season after it is finished. The writers must have so much fun making up all the stuff.",1366934400,,502,4.070707070707071

I actually accidentally stumbled upon this show when I was trying to watch another show on the CW website. Having been a huge supernatural/vampire/werewolf aficionado, I was pleasantly surprised upon watching it. The characters and storylines were gripping, fun, witty, entertaining, and intelligent. I absolutely love the characters Klaus, Daman, and Esther. They are the reasons I enjoy the show so much. I also like the fact that it takes place in southern Virginia, which is a haven for supernatural/urban legends. I have been to that area many times and have always loved it.",1366848000,,722,4.926229508196721

The price was very reasonable and affordable.  The product was in 'mint-condition' and worth ordering it from Amazon. I would always recommend 'everything' that Amazon.com has to offer.
When I find 'music' books/sheet music and CD's or DVD's (music/music videos') at another 'site'; I would always go 'online' to Amazon.com to see if they have 'used' items. 90% of the time; amazon.com has 'used' items and the 'price' is like half the price or even less and it's like the item is 'brand-new' or very little wear and tear.

It's based on high school kids, but there are story lines involving other older characters make me feel a lot less guilty for being my age (early 30's) and watching this show ;) Not only is there a seriously hot love triangle involving the main character, Elena, and two vampire brothers, but I really like how the other characters on the show also have incredibly interesting story lines, as well. I am always left really looking forward to the next episode. I'm not gonna lie, the violence in this show sometimes seems just a little gross & too much, but thankfully it's usually over pretty quickly, so as to not be a problem. That's my only beef with the show!! It's great show overall and is definitely worth watching. I hope that there's a 5th season and even more seasons beyond that. I really hope that the writing doesn't get too crazy so that the network doesn't consider cancelling it. Oh, and I'm on team Damon for winning Elena's heart!! :)",1366761600,,1032,4.524064171122995

5349485,2,B009LDCX1Q,I gave it 2 stars not because of the show. The Vampire Diaries is a great series for young adults and it had me hooked from the first season. I gave it a 2 because the quality of the video. The video would distorted through out the show so it was blurry and had to make stuff out. For $2.99 a show it was a waste for the quality didn't reflect the show.,1365811200,,353,3.8493150684931505
5349486,5,B009LDCX1Q,"In this 4th season Elena has to learn how to be a vampire, and her feelings for Damon are heightened. The Originals are still around, and there are super bad vampire hunters trying to take them out. It's been a thrilling season, and I can't wait for the finale when we are sure to see a showdown between the first immortal Silas and the entirety of the rest of the cast. Nina Dobrev has reached new heights with her distinctly different portrayals of newbie vamp-Elena and her self-serving narcissistic doppelganger Katherine. Ian Somerhalder's character Damon is still giving us that bad boy charm but has a renewed sense of honor and responsibility, and has stepped up to be there for Elena in many ways. Paul Wesley's character Stefan has redeemed himself after his violent Ripper bender, and may have lost Elena, but while he finds other interesting ways to occupy his time, he still loves her and would do anything for her.",1365811200,,928,4.734567901234568

The actress playing Elana has won awards for the part in the first few seasons, but her character is getting too whimpy in season 4. Even as a vampire there is something that is just not working. Don't want to put in any spoilers... :) Don't get me wrong, I have watched the whole season in a few weeks and will miss it while waiting for season 5.

5349531,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I really enjoy the new season of the Vampire Diaires, because it's always surprising me. Just when you think things couldn't get any more chaotic... they do! We begin the season wondering about the fate of our protagonist. Will she be human? Will she join the vampires? If she does, how will this effect her character and those around her. This is where it all starts off. I think die hard VD fans are going to love this season, and I certainly can't wait to see what will happen next!!",1365465600,,486,4.411111111111111

5349641,3,B009LDCX1Q,"As they grow in life (or vampire-death) everyone's lost their minds. No one has sense anymore, which would make sense seeing most were turned vampires in high school making them perpetually 16 or 17 only that number is enhanced. History keeps repeating itself again, and again, and again, the same mistakes are made over and over and over and now there's Silas who can kill Originals and bring on Armageddon.

  Katharine killed Jeremy, Damon turned Elena's humanity off and that severed something so it can never be turned back on, Damon and Stephan are emotional nit-wits when it comes to Elena, and Elena has embraced her new state-of-being that makes her more of a monster than Katharine and the Originals combined. Caroline has a yen for Klaus but insists on playing the ""I'm a better vampire than you because I have morals"" game; although in reality, each of them are about the same as he is morally but he's been around longer and came to terms with who he is a long time ago. Bonnie's stomping her feet, holding her breath until her face turns blue to get what she wants ranting, ""I'm in control, I'm in control"", but in reality she's everyone's favorite dishrag.

  Don't let me forget the ""Cure"", not the band but something that can turn a vampire human, that has everyone at each other's throats including the Original family who are now bonding together again to work a deal amongst themselves and take control, but there's only one dose and you have to drink the whole thing. At least Stephan, in a heart-to-heart moment with Damon says he's noticing they keep making the same mistakes over and over and he wants to change and not do that anymore. Will there be a light? Stay tuned.

  Where is this season going? You've got me but the one perk is Klaus isn't the biggest-bad bully anymore thanks to Silas. His hybrid-ness is so 10 minutes ago and that's brought him as close as I've ever seen to emotional nit-wittiness.

I must be completely out of it... when did highschool kids start looking like the characters on this program?  Believe me they are all very pretty, but let's face it they do not look 17 or 18.  It is nice to see Steve McQueen's grandson acting.  I also question all the alcohol consumption.  Since when does whiskey, scotch, or whatever lessen the desire for blood... come on.  Not that I abhor drinking, but the audience this program seems to be reaching may not need to see it used quite so liberally.  And... Damon  What can I say?

The pilot episode in the first season was so good that  it got my attention, even if the subject wasn't my favorite.

I have enjoyed the depth of the story and the charactors have all been great especially Damon Salvatore he is the guy you love to hate he he. I do not want to go into any detail as to what the show is about as it would most likly spoil it for anyone that might be interested in a Vampire/Werewolf type drama,but I will say if your curious get Netflix and stream the 1st seasons you will not be disappointed.

5349958,4,B009LDCX1Q,"The actors are good.  Somerhalder is a natural for his role - much better exposure than his previous TV roles.  As with any other successful serials, first couple of seasons are great, then the plot is extended and twisted, characters alternate between Jekyll and Hyde personas - in the end, it either you end up with apathy and move on to other interests, or you remain stuck in the world created by LJ Smith.  I ended up being apathetic.  Recommended for light viewing - not as an addiction.",1362355200,,493,4.568181818181818

5349988,4,B009LDCX1Q,"Some TV shows run out of material after a few seasons and start to turn weird and boring.  I'm happy to say that The Vampire Diaries season 4 does not exhibit any such tendency.  This supernatural romance saga continues to deliver sound story development that follows naturally from its original theme while delivering unanticipated twists and turns that keep you thoroughly engaged.  The scripting is top notch, and the performance of the actors is first rate.

The Instant Video product description for season 4 states that English captions are available, but I have not been able to enable them on my Sony PS3.  I don't know if they are visible when streaming to other devices or when downloading or viewing the episodes on your computer, but if you plan to stream to a PS3, the lack of closed captions (subtitles) should be considered.  This is why I rated the product only 4 stars.  The story itself deserves a 5 star rating, but I am rating the Amazon Instant Video offering of the product as much as the story.",1361923200,,1017,4.679775280898877

5350251,4,B009LDCX1Q,"I'm as much a fan of the exploitation of young people and vicarious sexual gratification as the next sleaze-bag, but, seriously: it's romance, not erotica! I'm willing to tolerate Stefan Salvatore and Tyler Lockwood changing personalities whenever the plot needs it (I'm sure it's more interesting for the actors). I'm willing to ignore the psychology of two 160-something year-old men competing in the seduction of a teenage girl--and I was pleasantly surprised when the script touched on that recently. I'm also ignoring the messages that an abusive, murderous family member is better than no family at all. I hope everyone else does, too.
I'm not complaining about the women in mini-skirts and thigh-high boots or the half-naked men. I understand that's part of the show. I'm complaining of a 16-17 year old character ripping his shirt apart in a manner I might expect to see in a movie with male strippers. I hope that sort of thing does not become routine.
I love the Vampire Diaries! I love the romance and the tragedy and the violence and the love triangles and the vampires. And the script. And the acting. Paul Wesley's face at the beginning of the episode was priceless! And Steven McQueen is a wonderful actor! I hope whoever thought of turning him into a stripper does not have any more ideas in that vein (pun intended).",1359849600,2,1333,4.850877192982456

5350282,5,B009LDCX1Q,"I wasn't sure, at my age, if The Vampire Diaries would appeal to me. I was hooked by the end of the first episode in Season 1. The writers have a good grasp of  creating dialogue that transcends age. The characters are 3-D and unique. The bad guys aren't all bad, the good guys aren't all good, and circumstances sometimes determine which side they're on, making for always interesting viewing. The casting is spot on, introducing some very talented actors. The story line grows with each season and Season 4 promises to keep viewers on the edges of their seats. If you've never seen an episode, go back, start with Season 1, ep. 1 and don't miss a one.",1359676800,,653,4.487394957983193

5350284,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I was ready to give up on the show this season.  I would actually have stopped watching several episodes ago but I bought the season so I figured I should push through it.  It was a chore.  Elena has become this pathetic creature and Damon has become a louse that takes advantage of a woman who is sired, meaning she has ""no control.""  As a vampire lore lover, being sired is a lot more intense than this show is making it out to be and my contempt for these two characters are is very high.  But, finally, finally, finally, the writers take Stefan, who they were turning into a weak individual, and make him strong, decisive and more what a vampire should be.  Love it!  The best line out of any of the seasons was Stefan telling Elena she had never seen him not loving her.  I loved it!  That is a man.  That attitude would make an awesome woman too.  Why would anyone want a wishy washy ""I love you but I love him too"" twit like Elena?  The beginning of this season was too much like the glittery vampires and the indecisive twit of a popular movie series.  Why can't we get real women for the main characters, someone strong like Stefan is becoming at the end of this series?  I will hold out for awhile, simply because Stefan is so intriguing right now but, if they only focus on Elena and Damon, I'm ditching this TV show next season.  I will definitely not be buying the season until I know if they are going to make the characters interesting again or if it's just going to be Stefan saving the day for me.  As much as I love Stefa right now, I'm not watching a show continuously for just one character.",1359676800,2,1611,4.25

5350303,5,B009LDCX1Q,"Amazon needs to add subtitles to it's streaming service.  It's hard for me to hear sometimes (especially with certain dialog) and I have to rewind several times to get the entire dialog. Which is a waste of time. I know this review is for the show and not Amazon's streaming service but I need Amazon to see this review and add this feature to Prime Instant Streaming videos.  Hulu has the feature...why not Amazon?  Or am I just missing something?  Once I get a response from Amazon I'll change my star rating:-)  Show gets 5 stars for sure though!!!

UPDATE!  I just saw that Amazon has captions.  Whether or not they have always been there I have no idea.  It seems it's only for certain shows since I also watch Star Trek Voyager and it doesn't have captions.  I'll have to see if I can get captions through my Roku's Amazon Instant Video app.  I'll update again when I find out if it has caption capability.

Update#2 : I watched Being Human on my Roku (through Amazon app) and found out on the menu where you have the option to ""watch now"" ""resume"" etc..there is an option for captions :)  Whether or not that has always been there I can't be for certain but I'm glad it's there now (at least for that show anyway...I haven't tried many others yet"".

If you tell someone what this is about they will most likely shrug their shoulders.
However there is something captivating about this series, - hats off to the writers.
This is one series that is NOT just meant for teenies, lol, ( I am not - haven't been for a long time!)
It's very well written , very well acted , an absolute Gem in today's TV lame market.
Steff and Damon are as unlike as Sun and Moon, but they do share a bond, I love Caroline for all her faults and the show wouldn't be the same without Tylor and Klaus.
Keep up the writing, please.
I hated losing Alaric and Jenna but I think it was for the good. This show just keeps evolving and I hope it keeps it up! Elena is a bit supernatural in this , but she is able to pull it off without being smotheringly sweet.

This is the first time I have ever ordered a season pass of any TV show but I have a tendency to get caught up in other things right around the time this is on, so it has given me the excuse to be schlumpy and lay around in my pjs all weekend and play catch up. I would usually wait until it is available on DVD but Amazon made it easy and affordable to view as I go and all I can say is it is well worth it.

5351023,5,B009LDCX1Q,I love watching The Vampire Diaries with my twin sister. Stefan and Damon are hot looking guys and great actors. Every part of the show keeps me on the edge of my seat.,1352592000,,168,4.121212121212121

5351025,4,B009LDCX1Q,"While this series may not be as dark as a person might think a vampire series would be, it is still none the less entertaining and if you start from the beginning of the series it is easy to get caught up in the story line. I do enjoy watching it. I would like to see Damon get over on Klaus that is too say actually over power him and I would also like to see him win over Elaina. I think they make a much better couple than Stefan and Elaina.",1352592000,36,444,3.8369565217391304

I love all the depth the characters are developing, Elena is becoming less whiney as a vampire, Damon and Klaus are still hot...but I am anxiously awaiting the return of Katherine!",1352073600,43,265,4.760869565217392

5351059,5,B009LDCX1Q,"This show is suspenseful and full of Drama and Romance and spooky stuff. It doesn't follow the book series at all, but is still a great watch!",1352073600,3,142,4.296296296296297
5351060,4,B009LDCX1Q,"I have a question: now that Elena is a vampire, and all of her senses and emotions are heightened to almost unbearable levels - how is she STILL so easily ignoring her feelings for Damon? At this point the writers are just dragging it out to keep the tension going, which is beginning to be annoying.

I am enjoying the plot and the majority of the characters immensely, particularly Rebekah and her struggle to be more human/make amends. And the secret sharing between Stefan and Klaus promises to be very bad news/interesting.

Elena is starting to annoy me, and I'm in favor of bringing back Katherine - who, having been keeping a close eye on Stefan over the years, surely knows that Elena is now a vampire and will be back to stake her claim and stir up trouble?",1351900800,6,767,4.510791366906475
5351061,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I used to love this show, but I'm actually getting pretty bored this season. I don't enjoy Elena being a vampire, and the storyline seems like it is trying too hard at this point. I watched the first 3 seasons and loved every minute, but I am not attached to season 4 yet ... I hopefully it gets better.",1351814400,6,303,4.1525423728813555
5351062,4,B009LDCX1Q,"My loyalty to this show comes from seasons 1 &2. Season 3's only redeeming quality being the flashbacks that make rewatching the show worthwhile, which in turn make season 3 more enjoyable each time. That said season 4 seems to be back to enjoyable for each individual episode. This episode has the added bonus of Tod Williams and the creation  of the original Vampire Hunters. Definitely a watch over and over again episode!",1351814400,8,425,4.821917808219178

5351077,3,B009LDCX1Q,"I love this show, and so far season  4 is amazing, however this first episode was not very well done. Everyone's reactions seemed to be just a bit out of character from where we left off only hours before in season 3. So far the next few episodes have not disappointed and I can't wait for the rest of this season.",1351555200,,314,4.147540983606557

5351083,5,B009LDCX1Q,"Aside from the fact that Ian Somerhalder is very easy to look at, The Vampire Diaries is the best thing in the supernatural genre since Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  If you're a vampire lover, this series is for you.  The writers are awesome and the actors work well together; that is a quick recipe for success in a TV series!

8542827,4,B009LDCX1Q,"I keep writing the wrong review. What I mean to say keeps getting lost in the sauce, but I have it narrowed down, and this is gist of it. The only thing, or shall I say person(s), that make this show float is Damon...and Elena...and Damon's relationship with any given character, especially dear Bonnie. Damon isn't perfect; in fact he's quite flawed, yet wonderfully heroic and far more selfless than anyone on the show will admit! He's gorgeous (with the most stunning, blue/green eyes I've ever seen) stubborn, determined, and, ok, manipulative. He's also a hilariously AWESOME smart ass. He kills people from time to time. Sad, but he's not without guilt, nor is he any worse than any other ""murderous vampire"" on this show. What irks me the most is his brother. Stefan. No matter what horrible acts he commits, the other characters grant him a pass and pretend he's the ""good brother."" Why? I say it's because he's a smooth talker and likes to ""help people."" So? Damon helps in his own way. In fact, Damon busts his BUTT on numerous occasions FOR his loved ones. Stefan is PIOUS. SANCTIMONIOUS. And a RIPPER. I'll tell you one thing Damon NEVER denies: he is a sinner, oh, what a shocker, and he never claims to be anything other than a ""monster..."" because even HE doesn't give himself enough credit....but Super Damon keeps popping through this so-called monster, while his brother styles his ""hero hair"" and horribly fails to make me feel anything but a yawn rising in his presence. OK, sometimes Stefan makes me feel a little warm and fuzzy, and sometimes I like him. But seriously? SPOILER ALERT.....In season 7, Stefan's ""Personal Hell"" is DAMON? And Damon must learn to face that he is A MONSTER? Whoever wrote this crap needs to remember that the audience isn't stupid. We remember Stefan's BS, and we know that Damon is not just a monster- he is so much more and we love him for it! Ian Somerhalder, AWESOME performance!",1530403200,,1934,4.707964601769912
