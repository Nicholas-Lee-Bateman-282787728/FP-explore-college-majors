4488411,5,B004WO9ORA,This show pops up on the military channel every once in a while and I always try to catch a few episodes.  The dvd's were recently released and I ordered a couple for friends and family.  (9 to 13 year old boys especially love the show).  If you want a example of the show you may go to the host's webpage -- his name is chad houseknecht -- then you decide if you want more.  He is a genius engineer with no formal training.  and he's really really hot.,1343952000,2,453,4.044943820224719
4488412,4,B004WO9ORA,"This was a great show. Mike is very informative and fun to watch while using the traditional weapon. Chad, though quirky, is also fun to watch as he and his assistant (I can't remember his name right now) build and test their modern equivalent. I'm glad Discovery finally gave this show the DVD treatment, since the show isn't being aired anymore. Thanks Discovery!

Edit 7/30/2011:
After receiving the DVDs, I am still glad that the show got the treatment, however, I am disappointed that there aren't any extras with it. Interviews would have been nice, but just having the show on DVD is good enough for me.",1310515200,5,610,4.700934579439252
8445482,3,B004WO9ORA,"Thought the focus would be more on medieval weapons like sword and shield, longsword ect, sadly that is not the case. wish it would have mentioned the weapons being covered in the description, would have saved my wallet a bit.",1513036800,,226,4.675
8445483,5,B004WO9ORA,Arrived on time and as advertised.,1500595200,,34,4.833333333333333
8445484,5,B004WO9ORA,Humorous and informative.  It is fun to learn the history behind these weapons and then see a semi-mad scientist try and better the design.  Love it.,1484524800,,149,4.6923076923076925
8445485,1,B004WO9ORA,not pal system cannot play it here in norway,1474156800,,44,4.0

8445487,2,B004WO9ORA,"This series seems to be more about entertainment than being informative. Also, they review mostly exotic and inconsequential weapons like the atlacatl, or ""semi-automatic"" crossbow which was semi-effective at a few feet and worked only by virtue of the bolt point being dipped in poison.
Also short on in-depth analysis of the weapons that are of interest, such as the composite bows of various armies. i.e. What was the pull weight, effective range, penetration potential with various arrow heads, etc.",1452384000,,503,5.3
8445488,5,B004WO9ORA,"As a History Buff, I find this DVD to be undeniably one of the best investigated materials on the use of weaponry and how it shaped our world. Most of us see a sword as nothing more than a sword, but to those who use them, it meant having the upper hand  in a battle. For it was the means to overcome their advisory and rule a kingdom. It was technology of their time and warfare as they knew it. The shapes, weights, lengths and grips all have a purpose, just as we constantly strive for better weapons today. Whether it be used to protect, or as an aggressor, weapons and the skill to use them are fundamental to our existence.",1447977600,,629,4.198347107438017
8445489,5,B004WO9ORA,A sadly short-lived series. Michael Loades is a real treat to watch as he investigates the nuts and bolts of  unique historical weapons,1443744000,,135,4.869565217391305
8445490,4,B004WO9ORA,"If you enjoy seeing ancient weapons and how they work then you will enjoy this, also great if you want to build your own",1390003200,2,120,4.041666666666667
8445491,5,B004WO9ORA,"super fun show, educational  fast moving well filmed  it will make you think about the advancements that could not have been made
without technology",1369526400,,148,5.125
