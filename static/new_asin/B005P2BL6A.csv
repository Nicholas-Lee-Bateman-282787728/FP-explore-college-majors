8482334,5,B005P2BL6A,"The Coast Guard is a fantastic movie about the frailties of the human mind and what damage prejudice and immaturity may wrought. The Coast Guard features young South Korean soldiers near the border to North Korea, tasked with guarding the waters against attack or infiltration. Putting young men, guns and boredom together is a recipe for disaster and it is not long before tragedy strikes and affects both the soldiers and the locals in ways heretofore unimaginable. Kim Ki-duk is known for painting a picture with our weaknesses and petty prejudices and does so here with a deft hand. This is definitely not a war movie or even an action movie- it is a deeply felt drama that delves into the darkest recesses of mankind's psyche. Recommended for any fan of thought-provoking film.",1374278400,3,782,4.887218045112782
8482335,1,B005P2BL6A,This is one of the worst Korean movies I have ever seen. Most are pretty good or great. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one.,1371254400,,123,3.96
8482336,1,B005P2BL6A,Thought this was going to be a war style movie from the cover..Guess I was hoping korean war...But this movie is depressing watching the main character go crazy and a local girl. I don't recommend this movie. Wished I could get my money back.,1335571200,,242,4.5227272727272725
