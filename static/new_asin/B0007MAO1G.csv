2220030,5,B0007MAO1G,"Great, short little stories for kids to watch.  Each has a moral and they are even entertaining to watch as an adult.",1304553600,,117,4.318181818181818
2220031,5,B0007MAO1G,"This has become my 2-year old's favorite DVD. She asks for it every day when she comes home from daycare to watch while I get dinner ready. It has some good lessons built into entertaining story lines. It auto-plays, unlike most DVDs where you have to get to a menu page first, so she can actually put it in the player and start it on her own. (Which is a good and bad thing!)",1276732800,2,376,4.094594594594595

3. House of Mirrors
4. By the Sea
5. The Stinky Milk Mystery
6. The Big Road Race",1459036800,3,350,4.161764705882353

8048886,5,B0007MAO1G,The DVD's arrived on time and in great shape. The stories are teaching my students while entertaining them. I am using the programs with my behavior disordered students and I am enjoying watching my student remember the lessons and discussing what happened and/or what should have been done differently.
