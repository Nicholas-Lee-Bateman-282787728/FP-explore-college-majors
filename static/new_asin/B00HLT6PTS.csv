8633378,1,B00HLT6PTS,"While there is some interesting information and footage of animals being collected, the author goes beyond the bounds with his bow and arrow ""hunt"" for lion. Why some primitive weapon hunters insist on trying to prove that their weapon of choice can take on any game animal on earth is a testimony to the size of their egos. In this set Mr Young insists on trying for a lion with B&A. First he locates simba, then closes in with bow ready and the hunting car very close, then shoots his arrow and jumps into the hunting car to race away while the lion charges. After the cat gives up and lays down, the hunting car drives back, and the process is repeated until the cat finally lays down to die. Gosh, isn't that sporting? The whole point in sport hunting dangerous game is to put yourself one-on-one against an animal that could kill you if you fail to kill it. Sticking an arrow in a lion and jumping in a car to race away is simply lion killing, not lion hunting.",1410739200,3,966,4.342541436464089
