2840124,4,B000KKK35C,"This movie actually starts slowly and then builds suspense.  It is about political maneuvering in the aftermath of a tragedy.  If dirty politics intrigues you and if you liked Ides of March, you might like this.  The plot is fairly tight.  Character development is plausible.",1379808000,6,275,5.044444444444444
2840125,4,B000KKK35C,"Nordic crime dramas are usually very well done. This is no exception. Amazon need to make more available, such as The Bridge and Borgen.",1373155200,12,136,4.708333333333333
2840126,4,B000KKK35C,"After giving-up the subtitles hang-up, international cinema is well worth it.  This movie is about a seasoned politician hungry for power who jumps to the opportunity of becoming chairman of his party as well as prime minister following a car accident of the incumbent.  There is only a week or two prior to election time an the game is on.  Leaks of possible bamboozling (kispus) of funds by opponent's husband to the press leading to tragic end, victim is kept on life support, wife is hospitalised , son is bought to stay away, all this in an attempt to secur power with all arrogant manners possible.  The real character of this politician is exposed by the journalists but still gets another high level position.  All in all entertaining movie.  Those who likes this type of movie might want to check out Borgen , another danish TV series about political intrigues, similar to previous american White House series.",1347494400,11,919,4.821656050955414
8197154,4,B000KKK35C,"I bought this more because I'm familiar with Lars Mikkelsen's English-language work and since I'm learning Danish, I'm trying to improve my listening comprehension. I'm not overly familiar with how Danish politics work in detail. Luckily, I didn't need too much detail to follow the plot and it was surprisingly engaging. Even if the resolution is a little pat, it has a much less overt moral than the average American attempt at political drama (with absolute good guys and the bad guys punished--the ""dragon"" to the villain, played as almost avuncularly amoral by Mikkelsen, appears to largely skate despite being the manipulating hand behind some very dirty politics, and an event that would bring everyone crashing down emphatically in a US drama is merely one element.)

The major down side is the NordDisk DVD transfer is about on par with someone doing a home-conversion VHS to DVD. No special features, no credits, and at times the subtitles seem somewhat amateur.",1514160000,,972,5.075

8197156,1,B000KKK35C,This comments is on the quality of the digital copy - the film occupies less than half the screen.  What is the point of paying for such poor quality?  Amazon disappointed me.  I wish they would refund.,1473033600,,202,4.405405405405405
8197157,4,B000KKK35C,"I picked this to watch as I enjoy political thrillers and foreign movies. I didn't give this a 5 star review, because it's a bit hard to follow who's who while processing the subtitles (Danish film). I'm not familiar with the actors from any other films/tv series and although that doesn't always matter, here it does matter because the acting wasn't spectacular. The plot was good enough which allows for a 3.5 star rating, hence the four stars.",1426464000,,446,4.730769230769231
8197158,5,B000KKK35C,"I have a short attention span when it comes to movies.  Start then stop and do something else several times before I finish a movie.  This one hooked me.  I watched it straight through. Great story.  Great acting.  If this had happened in the U.S. the main character would have been dead probably by day two.  A good example being Dorothy Kilgallen.  This is a well scripted, well acted, well directed movie.",1424822400,,408,4.583333333333333
8197159,5,B000KKK35C,"A quiet, multi-layered suspense drama that takes place just before the parliamentary elections in Denmark.  Although this will be categorized as ""Nordic Noir,"" the major crime here focuses entirely upon political corruption, and abuse of power. It is not a police-procedural, (like Wallander, Broen (The Bridge), The Killing), nor is the action centered around ""solving a crime"" Instead it takes us into the arena of how alliances between politicians and media moguls can operate to keep citizens misdirected and uninformed about what really goes on in the corridors of power, especially just before an important election, when the stakes are the highest.

The earlier review by ""Tom"" gives excellent background on both the back-story and the film itself.  I can add that I found it to be extremely well produced, with excellent acting and a fine cinematographic 'feel', which lends a sense of realism to the drama.

In Danish, with subtitles.  Highly recommended viewing.

8197161,4,B000KKK35C,"Eleven days before the parliamentary election, the Centre Party's main candidate, who is about to become the next Danish Prime Minister and his wife have a car accident. His situation is critical and nobody knows if he will survive. Even his wife, who is also hospitalised, is not informed. The next day, Torp is assigned to cover the election. Quickly, he is drawn into the internal power struggle in the Centre Party where two very different politicians, Erik Dreyer and Lone Kjeldsen, show interest in gaining power and potentially becoming the next Prime Minister. Torp, the son of a previous justice minister, writes his first front-page story after a tip-off from the Centre Party press coordinator, Peter Schou. The story turns out to be ""planted spin"" in order to damage Lone Kjeldsen (Nastja Arcel) to allow the advantage to Dreyer who benefits from her lost credibility.

The back story to 'King's Game' is said to be the story of an ex-parliament staffer who saw first hand the political games that were played. He wrote a book which then became a film. The film came out in 2005 and won many top prizes. This is the kind of political film that reveals what we only THINK goes on.

Anders W. Berthelsen, plays Ulrik Torp a newspaper journalist promoted to cover the Parliament because his father was a member, and he must have connections. On his first day he is given a 'spin story' after the current candidate for election in the Centre Party is brain dad after a horrific car accident.  Two members of the Center Party want to be the next candidate, and one if them plays very dirty, indeed. Ulrike gets caught up in the lies and intrigue and tries to figure out the real story.  This is intrigue and politics at it's dirtiest and at it's best. One of the better place,it's cal films I have seen.

The rest of the cast seem very familiar, two thirds of them have had parts in other Danish films, 'Borgen' comes to mind.
Sren Pilmark  as Erik Dreyer, Nastja Arcel  as Lone Kjeldsen, Nicolas Bro as Henrik Moll, Lars Mikkelsen as Peter Schou,  and Lars Brygmann as Mads. As Ulrike traces the misinformation to its source, he reveals what he knows to his editor and the paper's owner who turns out to be an old college friend of those at the top. Torp succeeds in some of his mission, but we wonder, is this the real world?

See rating of White House Down. Also well-acted, incidentally. The Brits don't have all the cards on good character actors, etc.",1391212800,,306,5.531914893617022

I had just finished 2 series of ""Borgen"" and found the story line of this ""Kings"" show somewhat similar to ""Borgen"". This was a bit trite. Otherwise very watchable.",1390176000,4,255,4.565217391304348
