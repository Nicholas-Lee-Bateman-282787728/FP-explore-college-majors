but others were more boring, such as when he is hounded by the two nasty men - if I had understood
Italian it may have helped.",1391126400,,226,4.27906976744186
8298221,5,B001EHYEU0,"First of all,  I want to thank the Italian store in Italy that sent me, through Amazon, this Italian TV movie of  Pinocchio with no problems.  The movie is very long, like I believe over 5hrs.  It is in Italian, no English subtittles.  Sorry for those who do not speak the language, they are totally missing out on a real jewel of a movie.  Also,  I must tell you that this TV movie, even though is 40 yrs old,  has been made  into DVD with great colors and picture quality.  I was truly amazed considering how old the movie is.  I hope that this review will help you decide to purchase this real jewel of a movie.",1335571200,3,614,4.162393162393163
