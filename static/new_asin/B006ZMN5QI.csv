5043462,3,B006ZMN5QI,"UPDATE x2: Unfortunately, I've had to deduct a star, and return this review to its original 3-star rating. Acorn (whom I purchased the DVD from) made a very public spectacle of attempting to put things right with me regarding the edited DVD situation. Unfortunately, it's been over 3 months, and they never sent a new, unedited DVD to me as promised. To make matters worse, attempts to contact them via their Facebook page have gone unanswered.

The product itself (""New Tricks"" Season 8) is definitely a 4-star affair, and I don't want to harm its rating. As it stands with the distributor (Acorn), however, that is decidedly a 1-star operation, and so this review once again goes back to 3 stars.

UPDATE: Since this review was published, Acorn have responded (both on Facebook and in the comments section of this review), and have been a class act in their acknowledgement of the issue, and how they plan to address it. I wanted to make readers aware of this, and that I am now bumping the star-rating of my review from 3 to 4 stars. Thank you, Acorn!

I've liked ""New Tricks"" since the pilot episode. The program manages to blend drama, light humor, mystery and suspense quite well. The cast are top notch, and the writing and direction are good. If I could give this set four or five stars, I would. Unfortunately, I am only giving it three. This is due to the fact that, for some reason, the episodes have been edited. Allow me to explain.

Almost all of the ""New Tricks"" episodes have a run time of approximately 58 minutes. The episodes on this Season 8 set run for roughly 51 minutes. I found this odd. I also found odd the fact that the late Trevor Bannister was somehow missing from the episode ""Old Fossils,"" which was his last ever role. As a fan of his portrayal of Mr. Lucas on the venerable British comedy ""Are You Being Served?"" I was looking forward to seeing him one last time. Alas, it was not to be.

Not only was Bannister's scene cut from the DVD, but so was his listing in the closing credits. The Season 8 episodes are available on You Tube, and so I went and watched them there, and lo and behold, there are *several* scenes cut from each episode (about 7 minutes worth), and in the UK broadcast version of ""Old Fossils,"" Bannister's name *does* appear in the closing credits. So, it was actually excised from the version on the DVD (along with his scene, and others).

This sort of detailed editing is uncommon to the prior season sets of ""New Tricks"" released by Acorn (seasons 3-7), and the BBC (seasons 1-2). I'm not sure what's happening with the Acorn release of Season 8, but please be aware that the episodes have been edited, to the point that roughly 60 minutes of total footage has been collectively removed from the set. This is an unfortunate and unsettling turn of events with Acorn, and I cannot award this release more than three stars because of it.

Seasons 1-7 are highly recommended.",1342051200,86,2929,4.557034220532319
5043463,5,B006ZMN5QI,"This show is fantastic!  There's nothing like a British who-dun-it.  They always do things with style and grace.  With New Tricks, you have one gritty, attractive female, Superintendent Sandra Pullman (played by Amanda Redman) who's in charge of three disfunctional, misfit retired copers who don't always like to play by the rules.  In fact, they often ignore proceedures altogether.  But that's part of what makes this show so great.  Actors James Bolam, Alun Armstrong, and Dennis Waterman brilliantly play their characters - Jack Halford, Brian Lane and Jerry Standing, who encounter some strange cases at their ever-moving U.C.O.S. (Unsolved Crime and Open-Case Squad) headquarters.  They solve the crimes no one else wants to deal with.  They may do some unconventional detective work in the process, but these ""old-timers"" are far more ""experienced"", ""clever"" and ""vastly knowledgeable"" - compared to their younger counter-parts.  This is definitely not like American cop shows (thankfully) with all the 'shoot-em-ups' and 'blow-em-ups'... you get tired of that stuff.  Give me a cop who has a head on his shoulders and knows how to use it.  That's what this show is all about.  What a refreshing change.  That's why New Tricks is so great.  From what I've heard and read, it's so popular the BBC is picking the show up for another two seasons.  FANTASTIC!!!",1340755200,21,1365,5.168949771689498
5043464,5,B006ZMN5QI,"It is very hard to come up with a police series which is truly original as the subject has pretty much been done to death from every angle over the years. However, the producers of New Tricks managed to do just that when they launched the pilot in 2003. Not really surprising that the show has run and run and we are now up to the eighth series and it has reached a total of 66 episodes. Good to see that we had 10 episodes this time round as in Series 7, rather than the 8 in earlier series.

Despite the long running nature of New Tricks, the script writers still seem to come up with original and sometimes quite offbeat plots. For example the last in the current series concerned the case of a zoo keeper whom it had been assumed had been mauled to death by a tiger, but whom the team suspect was killed before being put in the tiger's enclosure. As is usually the case, the truth, when it is teased out, is far from straight forward. Also good to see that we were not left with a cliff hanger at the end of this episode as has happened in some previous series and is unnecessary in my view since it tends to feel rather contrived.

A lot of the charm lies with the individual quirkiness of the three main investigators in UCOS - Jack Halford (James Bolam), Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman), and Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong). I thought the first episode in this series was interesting - it concerned the murder of a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum - but was lacking something. However, a lot of the interest does lie in the individual lives of the characters and we missed seeing Jack communicating with his dead wife in his back garden, Gerry with his many ladies and ex wives and daughters, and Alun obsessing and trying the patience of his wife, the long suffering Esther (Susan Jameson who is married to James Bolam in real life). However, happily more elements of their personal lives did creep back into later episodes which was very welcome.

As always Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redman) acts as an excellent foil for the three boys. Fans will be pleased to learn that a ninth series is planned for next year. However, one wonders how many more series will be possible without a change of personnel. James Bolam is a superb actor but he is now 76, and although he is wearing well, seeing him on screen representing the Met is beginning to stretch credibility. I did wonder if a comment at the end of Episode 10 was a hint that the BBC were perhaps thinking the same way.",1339459200,18,2514,4.449023861171367
5043465,5,B006ZMN5QI,"I purchased this from Amanda at the Amazon seller DREAM ACADEMY
This company has consistently fulfilled my orders for DVDs at a fair price with polite communications and timely delivery.
Amanda went out of her way to fulfill this special order and kept me apprised of every step on the order process.
I HIGHLY recommend dealing with Dream Academy
- Oh yes, as far as the DVD series
- This is a Great series, but I figured if you were purchasing the season 8, you already knew that.

5043499,5,B006ZMN5QI,"NEW TRICKS, like the proverbial vintage wine, just gets better and better. Despite series co-star James Bolams concern that the show is becoming stale (the reason for his departure from the show at the end of Series 8though apparently he does appear in the first episode of Series 9 to wrap up his storyline) anyone who enjoys the company of these old salts will find much to please the palate in this new set of ten episodes. And recent news that stars Amanda Redman and Alun Armstrong are leaving the show, though not until the end of 2013 (after Series 10 is filmed), is even more reason to enjoy the newly-released episodes in North America that comprise Series 8. If things are indeed getting stale on the show, we haven't seen it yet. In fact, word is Series 9, which has started being broadcast in the U.K. has some genuine surprises and great drama. Fingers crossed! For now, well enjoy Series 8, Acorn Medias North American release of the popular police show.

Lets face it, the plots on NEW TRICKS, good as they are, take a back seat to the character-driven interplay that is the heart of the show. So long as the beloved UCOS teams collective idiosyncrasies are on hand, all is well.

Things start off with a bang in the first episode, End of the Line, which sees star Amanda Redman giving the background of their current case (read exposition) during a long Steadicam shot that takes the team down a London street and into the Underground (the tube, or subway). Its a very impressive bit of acting, and proof in itself that the show has not lost its edge. It is also a reminder how deserving Ms Redman is of the MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) that she was recently awarded by Queen Elizabeth II. The storyline involves street people and one of the more prominent of these characters is played by the wonderful Tony Rohr, who was recently seen in a similar role on an episode of George Gently. John McEnery is also on hand, playing a role decades away from his troubled Mercutio in Franco Zeffirellis film of Romeo & Juliet.

Fans of the show will recall that Dennis Watermans real-life daughter Hannah has appeared in several episodes. Not to be outdone, Amanda Redmans daughter, Emily Glenister, appears in the episode Only The Brave, though youd never know they were related. Ms Glenister looks more like her real-life father than her gorgeous mother. She comes by her talent honestly though and appears here in one of her first professional gigs having graduated just a few years ago from The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, (this reviewers old training ground). Speaking of this fine institution, actors Cyril Nri and Julia Ford, who were there the same time as yours truly, both appear in the episode Setting Out Your Stall.

The last episode, Tiger Tiger, is arguably the best of the lot. The ending provides an easy segue into the departure of Bolams character, though apparently this is pure coincidence as he did not announce he was quitting the show until two days after the BBC renewed NEW TRICKS for two further series (9 & 10).

Theres an awful lot to enjoy in all ten of these episodes and while there may at times be a little less character interplay than earlier seasons, its still fun to watch and there are some great one-liners now and then to keep things light.

The episodes, for some reason arranged differently from their original U.K. broadcast order, are without exception good. Here they are:

End of the Line  episode 1
Lost in Translation  episode 2
Old Fossils  episode 3
Moving Target  episode 4
Object of Desire  episode 5
Setting Out Your Stall  episode 6
The Gentleman Vanishes  episode 7
Only The Brave  episode 8
Half Life  episode 9
Tiger Tiger  episode 10

Theres also a fun (albeit familiar-looking) behind-the-scenes featurette which reminds the viewer just how much fun the cast has making these shows. Yes, its a shame that some of the cast are moving on. At least owning the series on DVD ensures that NEW TRICKS can be watched again and again. And youll want to, what with the focus on character rather than police procedure. Thats why this approach is so important: once you know who done it, whats the point of watching something a second time? With characters this rich and their interplay so much fun to watch, well, thats a whole different matter.",1397433600,,4339,4.664482306684142

They are led by a once rising officer, who had her career stalled by a very unfortunate incident involving a dog.

The crime drama aspect of the show continues to be quite good, but it is the personal lives of the four lead characters and the organic integration of humor that makes this program stand out. It is indeed rare to find a continuing series in which all of the principal actors work so well together. Of course, the writers, producers, directors, and the other behind the scenes staff deserve much of the credit for the show's continuing excellence.

It's nice to see the actors and characters back doing their thing, but, some serious problems with writing and directing is noticeable. I never paid much attention to the writer's or director's names, but after the brouhaha with Alun Armstrong and the writer/director Simpson, I started to. The funny thing is I have found that the shows written and directed by Julian Simpson are usually rather boring. The plots seem overly complicated and focus on edge of society things, like UFO hunters or some other stupid plot device like that. There is usually some weird or bizarre character or actor in his episodes too, which in itself, is bizarre! The producers seemed to hand over a lot of power to this person and he appears to take the show in a different direction, one which I personaly don't care for. Season 8 isn't a total bust and there are still highlights and good acting to be seen. It's James Bolam's last season so you don't want to miss it.",1375056000,,1059,4.608465608465608

5043549,5,B006ZMN5QI,"Season eight (8) of the superb BBC cold case murder/mystery continues very well written mysteries that are solved by Sandra Pullman (wonderfully acted with loads of humor-- and this season with ""issues"" regarding her mom and love-- by Amanda Redman who  appeared in ""Little Dorit"") and her three (3) retired  ""old fossils""  (as the older detectives are called in one episode in Season eight-8).

Season eight (8,) with ten (10) episodes that are about an hour in length on three (3) discs with bonus features, again has Pullman directing three (3) very ""set in their ways"" older retired cops solving some heinous ""cold cases"" often with current ""tie-ins"".  These older retired cops, with their own ""issues"", certainly have their ""own ways"" of sleuthing--many time, much to the chagrin of their leader, Sandra.  That said, how delightful all of the characters are in Season eight (8).  My god, I do love this series because it is filled with wonderful characters, filled with humor, and filled with some well written mysteries that are solved ingeniously.  I look forward to future seasons.  Season eight (8) of ""New Tricks"" entertained me greatly.

(As a side note:  in this season, the character of Jack Halford, brilliantly acted by James Bolam, seems rather disgruntled a lot of the time and in the last episode, one gets the feeling that he won't be in the series for too long--too bad because the character of  Jack Halford is so very steadfast and wise)",1356825600,2,1459,4.910204081632653

5043568,5,B006ZMN5QI,"It is very hard to come up with a police series which is truly original as the subject has pretty much been done to death from every angle over the years. However, the producers of New Tricks managed to do just that when they launched the pilot in 2003. Not really surprising that the show has run and run and we are now up to the eighth series and it has reached a total of 66 episodes. Good to see that we had 10 episodes this time round as in Series 7, rather than the 8 in earlier series.

Despite the long running nature of New Tricks, the script writers still seem to come up with original and sometimes quite offbeat plots. For example the last in the current series concerned the case of a zoo keeper whom it had been assumed had been mauled to death by a tiger, but whom the team suspect was killed before being put in the tiger's enclosure. As is usually the case, the truth, when it is teased out, is far from straight forward. Also good to see that we were not left with a cliff hanger at the end of this episode as has happened in some previous series and is unnecessary in my view since it tends to feel rather contrived.

A lot of the charm lies with the individual quirkiness of the three main investigators in UCOS - Jack Halford (James Bolam), Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman), and Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong). I thought the first episode in this series was interesting - it concerned the murder of a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum - but was lacking something. However, a lot of the interest does lie in the individual lives of the characters and we missed seeing Jack communicating with his dead wife in his back garden, Gerry with his many ladies and ex wives and daughters, and Alun obsessing and trying the patience of his wife, the long suffering Esther (Susan Jameson who is married to James Bolam in real life). However, happily more elements of their personal lives did creep back into later episodes which was very welcome.

As always Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redman) acts as an excellent foil for the three boys. Fans will be pleased to learn that a ninth series is planned for next year. However, one wonders how many more series will be possible without a change of personnel. James Bolam is a superb actor but he is now 76, and although he is wearing well, seeing him on screen representing the Met is beginning to stretch credibility. I did wonder if a comment at the end of Episode 10 was a hint that the BBC were perhaps thinking the same way.",1352160000,,2514,4.449023861171367

5043580,5,B006ZMN5QI,"If you've clicked on this review knowing that it is the EIGHTH season for this absolutely fabulous BBC detective series, then you have probably watched the previous seven  seasons. If not, I recommend that you go back and find Season One and start from the beginning. There are two reasons for this: 1) though each 59-minute episode (unlike the US, the BBC is non-commercial and does not insert commercials in its shows) contains a different crime to be solved, the four main characters' lives evolve over the run of the show. And 2) You'll be missing some great acting in the earlier episodes.

As I said in my reviews of previous season's DVDs, ""This may be the best TV series ever - in my opinion."" Thanks to Acorn Media in the US, this volume (Season Eight) is available in the US as NTSC format, these were the episodes aired in the UK in 2011 but they don't seem dated at all.

And, I saw that there were concerns on Amazon that these are the ""edited"" episodes shown on US TV (there are some four-letter words that probably were excised for PBS.). I can assure you that the NTSC I viewed had episodes running the full original length.

These episodes are like potato chips; you can't stop devouring them once you have started. (But these shows are healthier for you than those chips - or ""crisps"" if you are in the UK).

I see that my fellow Amazon reviewer, ""Doc"" Wolf, has already provided the plot summaries for each of the episodes (but, thankfully, did not provide the outcomes) so I won't rehash them here, but will add to the info he provided. , Honestly, though, I highly recommend that you DON'T read them in advance. Even when watching I skip the ""plot outline"" shown at the beginning. It's more fun to ""let it happen"".

The last moments of the last episode of each season provide a small ""cliffhanger"" and this season is no exception.

The team from UCOS visit a flea market in, not one, but two episodes. The Natural History Museum and the zoo provide ""field trips"" for the team in other episodes.

There seems to me more concentration on the cases this time around though we do have to watch Brian deal with a sleep disorder and we learn a bit more about Sandra's earlier personal life in the form of an old co-worker/romantic interest and , in another episode, she gets a visit from her mother. Jerry and Jack's personal lives are not part of the scripts this season.
As the series continues and new cases need to be developed, some of the plots in this volume get a bit too confusing - I find it makes me play them again to see how the crime - usually a murder - took place. But these crimes are only there for the four lead actors to use their own unique personalities and expertise to work together. If there is an underlying theme here it is ""teamwork works!:.

Whenever I finish a Season of this show I go through ""New Tricks"" withdrawal, knowing that it will be another six months before the next season appears on DVD. But since the show is already into Series Nine on British TV, I hope we have many more seasons to come.

Beginning with Season Five, Acorn added bonus features. For Seasons Five and Six they consisted of a single  19-minute ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette. Last time we got Three bonuses, including a ""blooper reel"". This time there is one 19-minute ""featurette"" covering ""Sound Post Production"" and the ""Musical Score"" (a father and son team). I felt the detail was a bit more than the average viewer would want to know, but it's nice to have a bonus.

So keep on buying this series so that Acorn will keep releasing them. And ""Thank you Acorn"" for giving us in the US a chance to see one of the best shows on TV.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5043582,5,B006ZMN5QI,"One may immediately understand how this series is now available on DVD in its eighth series, with more series yet to be offered in the future.

Most New Tricks programs are written quite well and they make for light hearted yet true-to-life stories. In actuality, this series probably offers more true-to-life events than most other similar themed programs. Over time, one gets to know the characters quite well and there is always reason to enjoy each and every of the widely divergent personalities that regularly appear in each season.

While these actors may not be the pictures of perfection, the program offers insight to the many possibilities for older individuals to continue finding adventure and discovery in life.

This is a series that one can also enjoy watching more than once, which would seem to be the very reason to buy a DVD in the first place.

I think most viewers will find the series enjoyable and be left fulfilled at the end of each weeks adventures, while anxiously awaiting presentation of the next series.",1345248000,4,1034,4.8914285714285715
5043583,5,B006ZMN5QI,"This a a grand series and I hope they never stop. The characters, all brilliantly acted, are a female leader of an Unsolved Case (UCOS) unit in London, and three formerly retired top-notch old school detectives. They use modern technology and go about solving crimes, bantering, teasing each other. Each character his his or or weakness and foibles as professionals, but they perform terrifically as members of this special unit. If you haven't seen this series, it is simply wonderful. The cast is wonderful and the stories are always believable and engrossing.",1344470400,2,562,5.119565217391305
5043584,5,B006ZMN5QI,I first watched this series on PBS and become hooked on the oddity of the character mix. The crime content and detail is spot on. Very entertaining. Now my wife and I can't get enough of New Tricks.,1344470400,,198,4.2368421052631575
5043585,3,B006ZMN5QI,"NEW TRICKS is indeed a most engaging, entertaining, and enjoyable show.  I too have been a fan since the first show in 2003.  As mentioned in other reviews, Series 8 has been abbreviated.  I have the UK-issued DVDs of Series 1 through 8, and I did notice that in the American version of the DVDs, scenes have been cut sporadically throughout the entire 8 years.  However, no cut is as painful as the removal of Trevor Bannister's last role in this latest series.  I too contacted Acorn but have yet to receive a reply.

I still look forward to Series 9 and 10 even without James Bolam who has decided not to return to the show, but I look forward more to the UK-issued DVDs than the American ones.",1343865600,6,697,4.364341085271318
