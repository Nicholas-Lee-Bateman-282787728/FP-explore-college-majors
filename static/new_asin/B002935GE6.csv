3875809,5,B002935GE6,Great for cooking ideas and love the testing information for future purchases..  I plan to eventually get all the seasons.,1383177600,,122,5.1
3875810,5,B002935GE6,"This is how your mom would have taught you to cook, if your mom had cared enough about you to take the time... but it's NOT too late, because these DVDs ARE available - seriously - buy them all!",1366675200,,194,4.0
3875811,1,B002935GE6,This is the third time I have received books or videos in the mail that I did not order. It was such a nuisance (I am house bound) to return I ended up giving them away and wrote a letter and an email requesting no ATK to take me off their mailing list. I happen to like the cookbooks but the pushy dishonesty way of sending things I did NOT order do not want should be reported to the Better Business if it continues. You guys should be ashamed. mrw,1352851200,,450,4.011111111111111
3875812,5,B002935GE6,"Ms. Pym, the English novelist, wrote wonderful and funny books about maiden Englishwomen, often ""distressed gentleladies."" When her protagnists had difficulty sleeping, they reached for a collection of cookbooks next to their beds, and read recipies until they could sleep. Unfortunately, she lived before videos existed, but had they been available, I feel sure she would have endorsed them. Something of a distressed gentlelady myself, I'm often up in the middle of the night watching Chris and Bridgette fricasee a chicken, saute a porkchop, or whatever. One does what one must.",1351209600,,581,5.395604395604396
3875813,5,B002935GE6,"A must have excellent academic, thorough and entertaining culinary resource for all home cooks and professional chefs who desire to be a step above the rest, and not wasting their time in the kitchen reinventing the wheel. Regardless of which season, America's Test Kitchen takes the guessing out with detailed step by step instructions on how and why a certain ingredient, recipe and equipment is used along with a sleuth of informative factual and scientific tid bits explained in an easy-to-understand manner. Every season covers an array of primal and sub-primal meat cuts, fabrication, best cooking methods, equipment and product testing, ingredient taste tests, authentic to modern variation on many made-from-scratch global and regional soups, salads, appetizers, entrees, desserts, sauces, rubs, marinades and seasonings. Buy the whole collection and you will never be disappointed.",1272153600,,890,5.649253731343284
3875814,5,B002935GE6,"The shows are excellent.  I found the quality of the production to be very good.  The recipes are great, the episodes are fun to watch and they are often humorous.  I personally would prefer more cooking and less equipment and product taste testing, but that is just a personal preference.

[Note: There are no recipes included on these DVD's - of any season - until Season 9.  Season 9 does have recipes.  Presumably they will be included in future editions, as well.  Clearly they wanted to sell the recipes either in the companion book or online, so it is to their credit they have started including the recipes on the DVD's.  Also, there seem to be parts of episodes missing from the DVD's that were part of the actual season.  The web site has all the episodes listed with each and every recipe they did.]

I have copies of all seasons and I would recommend them in spite of these issues because they are very helpful, instructive, and fun to watch.

You can get all old seasons on their web site for 50% off and with quite reasonable shipping costs.",1262995200,4,1055,4.5
3875815,3,B002935GE6,"I would have given more stars, what is lacking is an INDEX of the contents and WRITTEN recipes.  Often they forget to mention quantities on the video, hence the need for the written recipes. You would think they would have been included with the DVD set, without having to join [...] to obtain them. Also noticed that not all episodes/recipes shown on [...] are not on the DVD's, see my index below of Disc 1.

But, I have learned a lot from the videos, just wish they would have included an index and recipes.
