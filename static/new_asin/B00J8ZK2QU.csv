8648810,1,B00J8ZK2QU,"Upon further review.....these appear to be pirates.  Obviously burned on aftermarket media.  Labeled ""Regions A, B, C"" but won't play in either of my Blu-Ray players.  ""Burned"" discs are unreliable.  Sometimes they work, and sometimes they don't.  Beware!",1512172800,,255,5.605263157894737

8648812,1,B00J8ZK2QU,"The cartoon might be great, but these are not standard Blu-ray discs.  These are BD-ROMs, not factory produced, most likely pirates.  Will not play on a standard US Blu-ray player.",1426896000,,180,4.966666666666667
8648813,5,B00J8ZK2QU,The best cartoon of my childhood. So happy they make it on blue ray.,1417478400,,68,3.9285714285714284
