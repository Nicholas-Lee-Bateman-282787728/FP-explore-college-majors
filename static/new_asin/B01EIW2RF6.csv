7736202,5,B01EIW2RF6,"This show is seriously my favorite show of any genre, anime or not. The second part introduces us to the Blue Dragon, the Green Dragon, and a little bit of the Yellow Dragon (but he is getting two of his own OVAs, one of which is already out and the second will be coming out around Christmas), and it is a strong follow up to the first part. Seriously, if you haven't watched this series, give it a try and you will hooked. It's absolutely fantastic.",1475366400,2,451,4.255813953488372
7736203,5,B01EIW2RF6,This is an amazing anime! It is full of adventure and cute romance scenes. My fiance and I love watching it together. Hopefully they will start the next season soon!,1473552000,,165,4.533333333333333

7736206,5,B01EIW2RF6,"*NOTE* - any of the previously listed shipping issues have been corrected. I contacted Amazon prior to purchasing to ensure I'd receive all the correct discs (DVD & BD) and was assured the issue had been resolved between manufacturer and Amazon. Mine arrived via same day delivery when I ordered last week and discs 1 and 2, of Yona part 2.

As for the series itself, it's still just as amazing and funny and immersive as part 1. I had my doubts about Yona of the Dawn before I bought part one but they were brushed aside before the end of the first episode. The artwork is great - including the gesturing and caricatures drawn in for comic relief, making many scenes twice as hysterical. Their mission and the trip along the way is filled with a thousand problems, emotions, laughs, tears, pain, happiness, blood, hard work, dramatic ideals come to life......and so much more.

Yona of the Dawn is worth adding to the collection of any anime fan. I enjoyed it from beginning to end.",1470009600,16,983,4.579545454545454
7736207,4,B01EIW2RF6,I got 2 disc 1 DVDs.  However I have a blu ray player too so I got to watch the whole series.  Was very cute series.  I'm not sure if this is the end of the series.  I would really like to know what happens after the last episode of this set. It's worth picking up and watching.  It's one of the few animes I've watched recently that didn't leave me depressed at the end.,1469577600,7,371,3.8933333333333335
7736208,3,B01EIW2RF6,would have love the series more for YONA OF THE DAWN: PART TWO IF I HAD DISK 2 INSTEAD OF TWO NUMBER ONE DISK...PLEASE TAKE OF THIS MATTER...THANKS JOE,1469404800,3,151,4.241379310344827
7736209,2,B01EIW2RF6,"I love this show, but I was super disappointed when I opened the case today to find that there were two of the same DVD's (part 2, episodes 19-24) and no Disc 1.  Looks like someone made a big mistake when packaging these.  Another reviewer has posted the same issue :(",1469145600,4,269,4.254901960784314
7736210,2,B01EIW2RF6,It came with 2 number 2 dvds missing number 1.,1469059200,3,46,3.7
7736211,3,B01EIW2RF6,I know for most people something like this wouldn't be a big deal but for somebody like me who is a collector this very much upset need to find this huge crack in the side of my case they should handle their products with more care instead of just throwing them into bins like they do...,1500163200,,287,4.142857142857143
7736212,5,B01EIW2RF6,Can't wait for 3rd season. It ended too abruptly.,1499472000,,49,4.555555555555555
7736213,5,B01EIW2RF6,Uhm.....Enjoyed it so very much but i feel like there needs another season...Where is it ;(,1497484800,,91,4.75
7736214,5,B01EIW2RF6,"Fantastic show! It's a little goofy but as the show goes on the characters quickly grow on you and the story becomes much more engaging. Part 2 is noticeably better than part 1 in my opinion, not that part 1 was bad but it's a little slow to get going and Yona could be a little annoying at first but again she quickly grows on you. Highly recommended!",1497225600,,352,4.1911764705882355

7736219,5,B01EIW2RF6,"I understand a few people ran into issues with incorrect discs when ordering this in the past, so when I received mine I immediately checked the disc numbers to verify they were correct. All the right discs were there, so I believe Amazon has fixed whatever issue they were experiencing with their distributor.

So, that being said, I've had no issues with this purchase and everything looks great. I'm so glad I now own the North American release of this anime, it's a fantastic series - my favorite, hands down.",1486512000,4,513,4.7

8758813,5,B01EIW2RF6,"This show was great! It's got action, drama, romance, fantasy. At first the main girl's voice is a bit whiny and annoying but then she gets stronger and becomes a likeable character. My biggest grip is I wish there were more! Please release more of this wicked awesome anime.",1527120000,,275,4.63265306122449
