8532416,5,B000PR0LY8,"This is not only one of the best films on cycling but one of my top films of all time. Not only will cycling fans love it, but those wanting to see the inside workings of cycling teams and dynamics of racing will get quite an education. Even more importantly, unlike other films of this genre, you get to know the individuals of the team as real people, each with problems we can all identify with. You'll learn how really great humans these guys are and how team owner, Bjarne Riis, has helped cultivate those feelings into a bond unlike any other team in professional sports. Some scenes will actually tug at your heart.

If you haven't realized it yet, I highly recommend this film. A very interesting aspect of the film is the weaving of numerous languages throughout which demonstrates the diversity of Team CSC and most other pro cycling teams.

One thing i must warn everyone about is I wouldn't recommend seeing this film on anything less than a high-def television because there are a lot of various text that pops on the screen which serves to add to the dialog during many scenes. This plus the sub-titling would be difficult to read without high-def.

There's a lot that goes on in this film and I have enjoyed it numerous times. Besides great filmography, the soundtrack is great. So much so that I wish a soundtrack CD was available.

So don't let this DVD slip out from being in your collection. You definitely won't regret getting this film.",1201219200,2,1457,4.592307692307692
