7934980,3,B00005A464,"Using cuisine as a sort of touchstone, this documentary explores many aspects of traditional Korean culture, including herbal medicine, Confucian and Buddhist rituals, and celadon pottery making. After a few scenes of crowded Seoul at the beginning, the film leaves modern Korea behind and goes out to the countryside in search of Old Korea. The film, hosted by a rather humorless food scholar named Bruce Kraig, gives a broad overview of traditional culture. Because it tries to cover so much, the documentary lacks coherence, jumping from a family's Ch'usok thanksgiving remembrance ritual to scenes of a Choson dynasty palace, with no obvious connection between the two segments. Throughout the film, one is continually struck by the minute attention to detail in presentation exhibited by the Koreans when it comes to traditional food, art, and ceremony. There seems to be a precise carefulness, even in daily life. The best parts of the film are when the narrator stops talking and lets the Koreans themselves speak about their traditions and foods. Director Jan Thompson (Prof. Craig's wife) nicely integrates traditional music, scenes from nature, and incidental shots of daily life in between comments by the narrator. However, the documentary is cinematographically inferior as it was shot on standard video, rather than on film or high-speed video. This movie is a decent overview of traditional Korean culture; but it is ultimately unable to transcend the mundane didactic travelogue genre.",1044748800,4,1501,5.364406779661017
