2355395,4,B000A2XC7G,"I love Janis Saffell's workouts. I have a lot of them. I tried this one and I did like it. It's not as hard on the cardio, however, in between days where you don't do cardio, this is a good one to help you stretch and really feel your body. Today, my muscles were sore from a new dvd I just bought ""Strike Zone by Janis Saffell"". So I gave this one a try and I feel stretched out and relaxed.",1155513600,3,392,3.8518518518518516
2355396,5,B000A2XC7G,"I do not like to exercise, so a workout needs to have a ""fun factor"" to keep me motivated.  I'm also picky about background and music (I like things brightly lit and good music that I can hear).  This video fit the bill on all counts.  Scott Cole is quirky & funny, while Janis Saffell is genuine & charming.  The set is clean and bright with no distractions and some of the background music was actually identifiable to me.  This workout was my first experience with Tai Chi and, while I didn't understand the meaning of all of the motions, it was easy enough to follow and a pleasant way to pass the time.  I have been trying for some time now to find kickboxing that I can follow, and the slowed down version presented here is perfect for my klutzy beginner capabilities.  I also really enjoyed the balancing  activities towards the end.  This workout probably wouldn't be strenuous enough for advanced exercisers, but for beginners and low intermediates, I would highly recommend it.",1152057600,8,987,4.626436781609195
2355397,4,B000A2XC7G,"Tai Chi Balance Workout is an interesting combination of slow and fast.  Scott Cole and Janis Saffell take turns leading a workout that begins slow and easy with a Tai Chi warmup and kickbox stretch and then moves into moderate activity with showing how Tai Chi moves are adapted into martial arts, and works up to a full-speed cardio kickboxing workout before slowing back down with Tai Chi cooldown and kickbox stretch.  There's also a bit of slow muscle toning and balance work.

When I'm in the mood for something a bit more intense, I go with Janis' Kickbox Strike Zone DVD; but when I want something a little gentler, I really enjoy this mix of tai chi and kickboxing.  It still includes cardio, it just takes longer getting there and stays there a shorter time.

It's interesting to see the differences and similarities between tai chi stances, kicks, etc., and those in kickboxing.  They are very similar in some cases, but different enough that it is helpful to listen and watch Scott carefully during the tai chi segments to be sure you have your foot positioning and weight bearing correct.  One difference I noted is that, in kickboxing, we shifted position using the back of our heel--such as when we are doing a hook punch--but in tai chi, Scott most often shifted position using the front of the foot.  I found this very difficult on a carpeted surface, so continued to use the heel more than the toe.",1145232000,5,1416,4.658634538152611
2355398,3,B000A2XC7G,The workout on the DVD was not what I expected. From the write-up I was expecting a more challenging type of workout. I enjoyed both of the instructors but I felt that it should have been geared towards a beginning/intermediate fitness type of audience.,1142726400,3,253,4.7727272727272725
2355399,3,B000A2XC7G,"The workout was a little slow for me. I really like the Advanced Tae Bo and some other faster workout like that. It is pretty focused, it just doesn't really seem like it gets you moving for a long time because you are going back and forth between Tai Chi and Kickboxing. Overall, it was ok. It's good if you want to do a slow controlled workout or if you want to work on technique.",1142121600,3,382,4.1066666666666665
2355400,4,B000A2XC7G,"I am a huge Janis fan, and this is another great workout from her - depending on what you're looking for.  The fusion of the kickboxing and tai chi is nice.  There is a ton of variety here, and you won't get bored.  It is also relatively low-impact, so for those looking for something without a lot of jumping and jarring, this would be a good choice.  However, unless you are a beginner or possibly intermediate exerciser, you may not get much of a cardio workout.  I consider myself to be at the strong intermediate - advanced level, and during some of the kickboxing sections, just when I just started to get my heart rate up, it was over.  So, if you're above beginner level and looking for a real cardio workout, this may not be what you want.

This is a great intro to tai chi, though, and Janis does a lot of the kickboxing moves slowly, so it is good for checking your form.  On some of Janis' other faster-paced workouts, she assumes a knowledge of kickboxing and other than occasional reminders, she doesn't go into great detail on form.

Although I didn't get much cardio benefit, I will definitely keep it for future use.  I'm thinking it would be a great workout for me on days when I'm a little under the weather or just want something a little lighter if only to get the blood flowing.",1140480000,9,1300,4.379166666666666
2355401,5,B000A2XC7G,"I was reluctant to try a fusion workout but I have practically all of Janis Saffell's workouts and love them, so thought I'd try this out. In the end, I loved the Tai Chi sections with Scott Cole almost as much .. if not more .. than the kickboxing sections!

The workout starts off with a 10 minute Tai Chi warmup led by Scott, with Janis stepping in to do a few quick stretches at the end. They will do this fairly often .. stepping back and forth and changing between Tai Chi and kickboxing. It is not distracting and in fact it was a nice balance as it keeps you on your toes.

Essentially you can call this circuit training as there is a contrast between the fast paced kickboxing and the slow but concentrated Tai Chi movements. It almost feels like you're having a nice stretch or massage after each kickboxing segment. Don't get me wrong, the Tai Chi segments get progressively tougher as we go along and you do work the muscles if you really focus ... so you will build up a sweat pretty quickly.

This 'circuit' goes on for about 28 minutes before going into an 8 minute strength segment. This section is very very tough and it relies a lot on balance with lots of slow movements which really makes you work those muscles. You can really feel the burn, especially in the pose that Janis takes the group through .. a flamingo-like pose where you're on one leg leaning forward with your other leg lifted high up behind you. After all that hard work you have a nice slow 8-minute stretch/cooldown.

It is also a good introduction to Tai Chi .. although I've heard that that itself is not 'pure' Tai Chi but it is a fusion of Tai Chi + aerobics. Personally I found it interesting enough to explore other Scott Cole workouts.

If you love Janis Saffell's workouts .. I'd recommend that you get your hands on this, albeit for something a little different.",1133740800,33,1859,4.408163265306122
2355402,5,B000A2XC7G,"If you have read any of my other reviews you know I am really pleased with Janis Saffell's videos.  This is a slower paced, feel good video, which also makes you sweat.  The combination of Scott Cole with Janis Saffell is really great.  Being new to kickboxing, this really helps to slow down the moves and perfect the technique.  Today I have a migraine, but needing to workout, did this video which actually helped me to feel better, stretched out, relaxed, while still getting in a workout.  This is a good compliment to other more intense strength and cardio workouts.  Janis and Scott are great!",1129075200,22,600,4.666666666666667

8073787,4,B000A2XC7G,I ordered this thinking I'd like Tai Chi but it's way too slow for me. I can see how it'd be good for some people tho. As for me I'd rather do balance with Jane Fonda or at the gym with Aerobics & Zumba.,1381017600,,203,3.6363636363636362

8073789,5,B000A2XC7G,"I like this marriage between Tai Chi and kickboxing.  Very well-done.  Easy to follow for a beginner.  You don't have to get it right the first time.  I like the instructors, and the music is nice.",1219536000,2,197,4.388888888888889
8073790,5,B000A2XC7G,"What makes this workout fun and wonderful,for me, is the slow and fast set of the Tai-Chi and kickboxing routines.  I also enjoy the friendly personalities and the chemistry of the two instructors who alternate leading the routines. The Tai-Chi exercises are the slow intervals , led by Scott Cole.  He is very helpful in describing on how to make the movements work for you. It's do-able for beginners. Next, the lovely Janis Saffell leads the kickboxing routines, which is the fast set.  You should know some kickboxing moves to performs these.  When I'm done, I know I've completed a strength, cardio and stretch program all at once!",1205280000,2,636,4.861111111111111
8073791,5,B000A2XC7G,"This is a good and solid work-out dvd with the great instructions, attitude and motivation one has come to expect from Janis Saffell. In this dvd she is working together with Scott Cole, Tai Chi Master. Janis and Scott refer to the work out as the Jing/Yang, which is very true. I feel very good, emotionally, after I have done this work out even though I am not sweating in the same way as after a regular kick-boxing class. For approx. 54 minutes Janis and Scott alternate between tai chi moves and classic kick-boxing moves. Even though I was not working up a great sweat, I still felt every part of my body afterwards. I highly recommend this as an addition to your work-out library. I do this dvd about 1-2 times a week.",1193184000,,725,4.417910447761194
8073792,5,B000A2XC7G,"I really love this dvd.  I've never done tai chi before, so that part was an introduction for me.  It is a fun, low-medium impact workout.  It is a really nice combination of kick-boxing and tai chi.  I enjoy it, and would recommend it, especially as something a little different.",1192579200,3,280,4.54
8073793,3,B000A2XC7G,"I really like Janis and the kickboxing portion of this workout but i don't like the mix of Tai Chi and kickboxing. Tai Chi is very, very slow (i almost felt like it is interpretive dance) and, of course, kickboxing is very high energy. The mix just didn't work for me. I feel like Janis and Scott were dating and just decided that they should do an exercise video together.",1172534400,2,373,4.3428571428571425
