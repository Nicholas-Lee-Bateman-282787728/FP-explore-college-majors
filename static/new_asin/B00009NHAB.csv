1885705,3,B00009NHAB,"Low budget horror flicks can be delightfully loony.  Low budget European horror can be even loonier.  With that disclaimer, we will proceed.  A deceased spiritualist and his disciples return from the grave to exact vengeance on his unfaithful wife and a host of enemies.  The script claims inspiration in the writings of Edgar Allan Poe.  Well, maybe.  The assertion of source material probably has more to do with the success of Roger Corman's adaptations of Poe than with the Dark Master of American letters.  The bleak B&W photography and the average video transfer of the low priced DVD diminish the impact of Barbara Steele, although her dark good looks still manage to project.  She appears briefly in the bathtub, and another scene displays ample leg and thigh, but don't get too excited.  It isn't that sort of movie.  The monsters are zombies (sort of) that carry the plague in their very touch.  One problem, the viewer never actually sees the creatures.  Hands emerge out of graves, around corners, etc. but the menace is largely unseen, except for the grisly results.  The period detail is okay, but the movie lacks the power punch of a Hammer Films color display.  Despite the limitations, die-hard fans of ghostly horror can have fun with this movie.  Other viewers should creep on by.  ;-)",1104883200,6,1304,4.885844748858448
1885706,1,B00009NHAB,"I want to reinforce the prev. reviewer who said steer clear of the Alpha Video DVD.  I can tolerate a slightly subpar transfer, but this is intolerable.

You can barely tell which actress is Barbara Steele.  Avoid.",1094860800,23,214,4.72972972972973
1885707,3,B00009NHAB,"A lawyer (Walter Brandi) receives a letter from a strange client named Jeronimus Hauff, who wants a will drawn up. Upon his arrival at the dark castle of Jeronimus (complete with a glass case full of mummified hands), the lawyer finds out that Hauff's been dead for a year! It seems that Mr. Hauff was dedicated to the supernatural, especially raising the dead. His castle was once a hospital where plague victims stayed and died. It is of course, cursed. You see, five men (along with Mrs. Hauff) circulated a petition to have Hauff run out of town, so Jeronimus gathered them together and threatened to expose the bad things he knew about each of them. One of the five killed Hauff to the collective glee of the others. Jeronimus cursed them all with his dying breath. One year later, the five men are turning up dead, covered in icky sores. One of them commits suicide by impaling himself on a sword. The lawyer falls in love with Jeronimus' beautiful daughter and must figure out how they can stay alive. There are some interesting sequences in between stretches of dullness. Barbara Steele plays Jeronimus' cheating wife. Her huge eyes are definitely a high point. There's a nice bathtub scene with, alas, too many bubbles. Her Morticia-esque looks and perma-frown are perfect for the gloomy happenings. I just wish it had been more frightening! I mean, a glass case full of mummified hands comes to life, only to wiggle around a little bit? Not even one nice strangulation scene?? Sheesh...",1078617600,2,1496,4.77992277992278
1885708,3,B00009NHAB,"5 tombe per un medium directed by Massimo Pupillo, is a lackluster spaghetti horror (as in spaghetti western?)!  Also known as Cemetery of the Living Dead, this Italian chiller thriller benefits largely from the presence of the stunning queen of horror flicks Barbara Steele.  Generally a bunch of nonsense about a terrible plague, in which the victims are then summoned from the dead by an idiot for some vague reason.  The transfer is good, but then film was dodge and dubbed to begin with so beware.  Still for Steele fans a nice treat at this price.",1067904000,8,553,4.729166666666667

7991995,5,B00009NHAB,"This movie was filmed in 1965, so it is a black and white thriller with a very  high quality in picture and sound. Because many of the old movies lose picture and sound, so it is not the case of this film. Besides has a great atmosphere and special effects for the time.",1473206400,,270,4.09433962264151

7991998,4,B00009NHAB,"This review is for the DVD Terror-Creatures from the Grave - Digitally Remastered, from Mutant Sorority Pictures.  The movie on this DVD is Terror-Creatures from the Grave.  The picture on the box, and the credits listed on the box, are from a movie called Nightmare Castle (aka The Faceless Monster). Nightmare Castle is not on this DVD.

The image quality of this movie is okay, but not great.  I haven't seen any other prints of this movie, so I can't compare it to other copies. The image quality is better than many other ""old"" movies like this that I've seen - it's very watchable.

The sound quality is good.  I didn't have any problem understanding most of the dialog.

I'm only giving 4 stars because of the wrong picture and credits on the box.  Otherwise, all Barbara Steele movies get 5 stars as far as I'm concerned.",1430006400,5,829,4.591836734693878
7991999,5,B00009NHAB,Excellent. Thank you very much!,1411516800,,31,5.4
7992000,4,B00009NHAB,"Yes, you can recognize Barbara Steele in this Gothic thriller. For fans of Nightmare Castle, The Blancheville Monster , Castle of Evil , films of that sort, this one should be right up your alley. Ghosts/zombies/creepy eerie black and white photography...its worth owning..
I own the Alpha DVD and yes the print is AWFUL but its not so bad that you cant see who the actors are. But it's a horrible botched release from Alpha, its blurry , at least in 3 places the sound gargles(like film reels once did).
There is a Sinister cinema DVDr of it and there is yet another release of it paired with the Long Hair of Death..but I heard this DVD is also poor quality.. I suggest for those wanting a better restored release of this movie, contact some of the studios through social networking sites or through the company's own website.. Retromedia would be a good choice , maybe Severin films",1402012800,,885,4.6075949367088604
7992001,5,B00009NHAB,"When a movie is badly dubbed into English with a horrible video and sound transfer and yet still manages to keep you interested, you know you are watching a good film. Barbara Steele stars in this supposed Edgar Allen Poe tale revolving around a plague, revenge, witchcraft and zombies. Stylishly striking shots, creepy Gothic atmosphere, a quick moving, interesting story and some wonderfully gory special effects will keep you straining your eyes and ears while attempting to watch this goodie, which sadly, is only available via a horribly washed out, faded, garbled, splotchy print shoveled out by several discount/dollar DVDs - but its definitely worth the effort. It still boggles my mind that in this day and age, so many of Barbara Steele's classic horror films remain unavailable or only offered in sketchy public-domain ""prints"". Someone please remaster this classic!! Of special interest to anyone who likes Hammer, Italo or Gothic Horror and Barbara Steele fans.",1339977600,2,974,5.25
7992002,3,B00009NHAB,"A ""B"" Horror staple that's OK if you don't expect too much. There's some good work & a story with some that's not quite so good. Not a bad go. Not great either.

Remember that these old horror creations founded the themes today's horror fans love & get with modern F/X. Keep your eye out for F/X in these old ones that was pirated & improved into your modern movies. Worth watching. 3 stars",1264896000,,390,4.27027027027027
