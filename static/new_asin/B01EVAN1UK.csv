I am so happy they decided to release this work; it would have been a shame if it got lost, especially since Paco disappeared two years ago. It makes it so much more special seeing him on top of his game creating magic.

8759623,5,B01EVAN1UK,This is unquestionably the most beautiful and compelling guitar DVD/CD ever released.  Nothing can compare to the mastery of these two musicians.  The extended closeups of Paco and John as they interact is a gift their fans may cherish forever.,1475798400,,244,5.075
8759624,5,B01EVAN1UK,"In some ways,this was easy to review. I am listening to two first class guitarists. I enjoy and learn every time I see either or both or with Al and Larry in the trio format. However,my beef,as a guitarist,is that I wish the cameras would just go back to center stage more often,and show both mens fret work more. I know,I know,I'm thinking like a guy who wishes to study their every move on the fretboard. Do I need to see their faces and backs?All I have to do is listen to these guys music to get an idea of what they are feeling. The music says it all. All you have to do is hear the music,to see how much these 2 guys enjoy each others work. Also,I should say thank you to John,if he was the force behind putting this out,years after the concert was done. Also,may I take a moment to say Paco,you were first class,and may you rest in peace.",1475539200,3,845,4.158536585365853
8759626,5,B01EVAN1UK,"I've followed Mr. McLaughlin closely since the 70's. By far he is my favorite guitarist, musician, and composer. Paco gives my guitar hero a run for the money. This is a great pairing with a great audience. A must have for guitar lovers and fans of Paco and John's!!!!",1471046400,,268,4.489795918367347
8759628,5,B01EVAN1UK,"I guess everyone is different. Just having these performances in both audio and video format is a treasure in my opinion. On top of that, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of both the DVD and the CD's. They sound great. It is refreshing that someone took the time to put this together and ensure a good quality product. I know what the other reviewer means about some of the camera work not focusing on the fingerboards during certain passages but plenty of it does and I didn't feel this took away from the dvds at all. This is Paco and John in their prime and you can't ask for much more than that. They both absolutely burn here. Some of their best arrangements here. If you love jazz, flamenco or any of the guitar trio albums, especially Friday Night in San Francisco, I believe you will be very pleased with this.",1466812800,7,829,4.42483660130719
8759629,3,B01EVAN1UK,"I don't write many reviews, but I had to issue this one. The music is great (CD) but the video (DVD) is terrible. This is one of the worst concert videos I have ever seen. Seconds into the 1st track, the viewer is blinded by reflections from McLaughlin's guitar. It is all down hill from there. The director must have been attempting an artistic statement instead of simply showing the players. Some of the most interesting solo passages are shot from BEHIND the guitarists. Others show close-ups of the faces. When John and Paco finally appear on stage together, we get a distance shot, something like what you would see if you were seated in the back of the venue. I quit after the 5th track. I will take the CDs into my listening room and never look at the DVD again. I can't tell if this concert is available in CD only. if you can get the CDs without payijng for the DVD, do so. The music is identical, it just takes 2 CDs to hold all the tracks. There is nothing extra added to the DVD.",1466726400,10,992,4.281914893617022
