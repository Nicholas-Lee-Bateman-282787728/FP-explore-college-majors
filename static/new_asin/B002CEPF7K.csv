I especially like the many different soundtracks to choose from.  For meditating, I like the Bamboo Flute; for a trip down the memory lane, I recommend the Hawaiian Guitar track;  as background music for my yoga practice or reading, the Meditative is my favorite.  You simply choose the track to fit your activity and mood ... it's like having six DVDs for the price of one.

Every time I play this DVD I feel the tension in my shoulders melting away.  Watching the ocean and hearing its sounds is an effortless way to settle the nerves.  I highly recommend this video to people who wish to bring more tranquility into their lives.",1247616000,,744,4.466666666666667
