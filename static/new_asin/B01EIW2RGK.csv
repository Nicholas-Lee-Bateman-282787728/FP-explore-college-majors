8758904,4,B01EIW2RGK,"Touches of technology and a culture to figure out. Bumbling henchmen, happy-go-lucky women that defy the logic we're learning about. The story reveals more and more of the world, its bright and pastoral designs mixed with both high and low tech in a way both subtle and overt. No fanservice to distract from the ride. Where's this going? But when the shooting begins, the lines are drawn pretty quickly as the answers ro the mysteries pile atop new questions. A well paced anime with good Japanese voice acting and great visuals. The tone feels off kilter, though, and at odds with the art style - people getting shot ""looks good"" like the flying machines, religious objects, town designs, and costumes. Instead of being a light, weird trip, it dares to bare fangs. There's an ugliness here, in humanity, but the ending is good.",1485734400,6,828,4.7972027972027975
