7946000,5,B00005MM74,"Amazon.com sent me an email about The Little Rascals DVD.  I know a lot of people are
making collections of DVDs during their childhood years a lot.  Checked the msg out
and found several different volumes and snatched up several of them.  Now when my
g'children come and say they are ""bored"", I can turn these on and watch them laugh as
I did long ago.  They aren't as expensive as Laurel and Hardy dvd's.",1362787200,,406,4.373333333333333
