200936,5,1602743630,"My daughter and I attended the 50th Anniversay Merrie Monarch Festival to celebrate her 40th. birthday and my retirement.  Neither of us had ever been to Hawaii before, but a friend of hers strongly recommended that we attend Merrie Monarch.  (Our trip was planned around the dates of the festival.)  So glad we did!  We were mesmerized by the hula dancers, and loved the male hula dancers!  I never knew that there were male hula dancers until Merrie Monarch.

The 50th. Anniversary DVD set from Merrie Monarch has allowed us to re-live, and to share with our family, one of the most memorable events of our trip to Hawaii.  Will treasure it always.",1389571200,4,650,4.699115044247788
