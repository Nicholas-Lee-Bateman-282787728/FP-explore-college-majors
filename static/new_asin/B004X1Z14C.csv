4491346,5,B004X1Z14C,"I went into this just looking to be entertained with a movie of this genre.  This film provided that in spades.  It is not a masterpiece by any means, but it delivers the goods for my tastes.  I don't require perfect history to be followed, this film never claims to do that.  I never understand why people want that from pieces of filmed entertainment.  I found the film to be very well paced and the battle scenes visceral and bloody. Yes there is a little too much shaky cam in the action scenes but that lessens as the movie unfolds.  I think they did a fantastic job with a limited budget.  I purchased the film just based on the trailer and not once have I regretted that decision.  I am a fan of this type of movie, and if you don't try to nitpick the historical details and basic script (which is more than adequate to me) you will enjoy it too.",1312156800,,853,4.222222222222222

4491348,5,B004X1Z14C,"James Purefoy is definately the new medevil star of movies. I thought he was great in Rome but seeing how he can turn things around and serve as a Templar Monk for most of his life then come to life as a very tough warrior and still think for himself! Paul Giamatti was also very good in the part of King John, he really made you hate him and wish him ill!!! Regardless what others have written, I thought this was a very enjoyable movie with a cast of mostly new comers or little known actors who did a great job! This is why I don't rely upon others ratings and reviews anymore, too many five star and great reviews have turned out to be duds in my opinion, especially war stories or police movies, those are two that I have a lot of experience in both!  Nick Donvito, Camillus, NY...Ret Police Sergeant and 100% Combat Wounded Vietnam Veteran who proudly served with the 1st Air Cavalry Division in 1968/1969.",1312070400,4,912,4.364705882352941
4491349,3,B004X1Z14C,"Perhaps it would be more accurate to say this was inspired by an historical event, rather than being based upon it. Historically this comes after ""Robin Hood"", and before ""Season of the Witch."" It is certainly more historical than ""Season of the Witch"" and ""Robin Hood.""

Paul Giamatti is a great actor, although previous actors have portrayed King John as being a lot taller. The movie makes statements such as when the knight is talking to his squire:

Knight: ""Have you ever killed a man before?""
Squire: ""No""
Knight: ""It is not a noble thing.""
Squire: ""Even when it is for freedom?""
Knight: ""Even when it is for God.""

The battle really had nothing to do about freedom. The whole Magna Carta was designed to give rich barons more power over the king. It was a struggle within the feudal system as to who would be the boss. The serfs were still serfs no matter who sat on the throne.

This movie takes place after King John is forced to sign the Magna Carta and then he instantly reneges on it. John employs the use of foreign mercenaries to go after and kill each of the barons who signed the document. Baron Albany decides to take a stand with a small group of fighters while waiting for help from the French...who will be their new king, all the while spouting about the ""freedom of men."" The movie climaxes at the siege of Rochester Castle which was initially turned into a battle and included a Knight Templar. The fighting includes blood splattering on the camera lens and a man being cut in half (lengthwise). The King's army manages to erect multiple ladders against the wall, fills them with soldiers, but apparently only 6 or so soldiers can make it over at a time and more can't come over until the previous ones have been killed... only in the movies. To add drama between the fighting, the castle baron's wife is not being serviced properly by the baron. She (Kate Mara as Lady Isabel) has eyes for the Knight Templar (James Purefoy as Thomas Marshall) who has taken an oath of chastity. (Guess how that works out.) The cruelty displayed by King John at the end is historical.

James Purefoy was lame in his character, perhaps by intention. More of Giamatti was needed. Not as good as ""Robin Hood"" or ""Season of the Witch"" but better than Roger Corman's ""Cyclops.""

Brief nudity (not Kate), no F-bombs, brief sex.",1312070400,,2329,4.586538461538462
4491350,3,B004X1Z14C,"Grunts, groans, grime and gore are the key ingredients here.  English definitely wants to be sure his audience understands what thirty pounds of pointed steel can do to flesh.  The rest of the film is basically a by-the-book castle seige carried out in drab dirty-dozen style.  Worst of all, you have to wait over an hour for the sex scene and the stupid director decides to not go graphic after going over the top with all the slicing and dicing preceding it.  Lame.  Cornball performances make sure you don't have much sympathy for any of the casualties.  Definitely a hack job, but at least it's the kind of Medieval entertainment that does manage to get the bad taste of a Summer Renaissance Fair out of your mouth.",1311811200,8,719,4.622047244094488
4491351,2,B004X1Z14C,"Well, the product description had that right: ""A Medieval Magnificent Seven...""

Except not nearly as entertaining. Now I can see why this flick went straight to video.

There were some interesting scenes. When Paul Giamatti was on screen tearing up the scenery as King John, that was interesting. The same with most of Brian Cox's scenes.

Other than that, this flick didn't really have much going for it. A lot of swordplay VERY loosely set in a historical context. A bunch of actors I didn't recognize, many speaking in such deep accents I had a hard time figuring out what they were saying, swinging a bunch of swords around amid a lot of MTV-type jittery camera work.

Ummmm... yeah. If you're really desperate to kill a couple of hours, I guess this beats dental surgery.",1311811200,2,777,4.733333333333333
4491352,4,B004X1Z14C,"""Any action against the throne must be punished ruthlessly, for that is the only way to maintain the absolute power of a king."" In the 13th century King John (Giamatti) signs the Magna Carta, then reneges on it and begins a quest to bring the entire country back under his rule. When he reaches Rochester Castle he meets resistance, and the future of the country rests on this battle. I have never been a big fan of these types of huge epic mid-evil type movies. That said, I really, really enjoyed this one. This is not for those who are disturbed by violence and blood. This is very gory in some parts, to the extent of cutting off someones arm and then beating someone with it. I loved it, but it's not for everyone. The main problem with this movie is that when the action is not going on it movies a little slow. But the action that takes place more then makes up for the slow moving parts. The acting alone takes this movie from a cheesy B-movie that could have been on the Scy/Fy channel into a more legit movie. Overall, very bloody, very gory, very good acting, very good movie. I liked it. I give it a B.

Would I watch it again? - I don't think I would, but it is very good.

4491353,4,B004X1Z14C,"Note, some spoilers follow.

Ironclad is your typical formulaic medieval movie; a motley band of brave warriors makes last stand against overwhelming forces led by evil, despotic ruler.  Warriors are slowly whittled down to just a few, with the hero and the cleavage-baring princess sharing smoldering glances.

Ironclad is unique in the strength of its cast, despite its small budget.  You have Brian Cox, James Purefoy (how far he has fallen since Rome!), Derek Jacobi, Jason Flemyng, Paul Giamatti, Charles Dance (plays Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones), Kate Mara (who replaced Megan Fox), and one of the pirates of the Caribbean who plays a Legolas-type role.  Paul Giamatti is entertaining in his over-the-top role as the murderous King John, bent on killing all who forced him to sign the Magna Carta.  However, even with the star-studded cast, the storyline is insufficient to keep the movie together.  We're left with brutal action sequences, but even the action sequences were only average.  They used too much ""shaky-cam"" footage, leaving this viewer with a slight headache.

It's clear that Ironclad takes liberties with historical events, but I do have to give them credit for at least alluding to those historical events.  For example, historically, the Rochester Castle keep was undermined with fat from 40 pigs.  However, in the movie, whole pigs were burned to undermine the keep (which would have made a delicious barbecue).  Historically, King John did cut off the hands and feet of surrendering rebels, and we certainly see that here in rather gory detail.  Historically, King John starved the rebels into submission, and in the movie, we do see some effects of starvation.

Ironclad isn't an Oscar-winning picture by any stretch, but it's an entertaining movie.  Sure, it might be formulaic, but it's fun watching Purefoy hack through scores of woad-like blue Danes with his historically inaccurate five foot long Zweihander.  I rate it 3.5 stars (more than generous) because the film tried to push the limits of its small budget.

**I had some concerns about the extreme level of gore in the movie.  Most of the violence has digital blood added in, but there are several gory bits that one should be aware of.  A tongue is chopped off, a limb is repeatedly hacked by a blunt instrument until severed, said severed limb is used to beat another enemy combatant, a man is chopped in half, faces are crushed, a man's collarbone is hacked repeatedly, throats sliced, abdomens opened, hands/feet lopped off, and corpses tossed against buildings.  Ironclad is definitely not for the faint of heart.",1311120000,121,2615,5.065420560747664
4491354,3,B004X1Z14C,"I have been waiting for this movie to be released ever since I first heard about it back in 2009.  Back then it was supposed to star Megan Fox, but for one reason or another she did not end up making the movie.  Also, it was originally supposed to be a theatrical release, not a direct to video release.  Despite what the Editorial review says, ""Ironclad"" is NOT a true story. It is a fictional movie based on historical events.  ""Ironclad"" is based upon the siege of Rochester Castle during the First Baron's War (1215-1217).  The war began when King John, having recently signed the Magna Carta, reneged on his promise to abide by the provisions of the documents which would significantly limit his power, and give the nobles the right to override the King at any time using the right of Distraint, and the tenets of The Law of The Land versus the will of the King.  In return for his agreement to the Magna Carta, the Baron's had renewed their oaths of fealty to the King.  When King John refused to honour the document, the Barons went to war against him.  In the movie, the rebels are portrayed as Knights Templar, and King John recruits Scandinavian mercenaries to fight them.  This is pure fiction.  King John conducted the war himself along with Hubert de Burgh, the Earl of Kent; William Marshal, the Earl of Pembroke; and loyal English knights, no Scandinavians.  The rebels were English Barons led by Robert Fitzwalter with support from Prince Louis of France, who subsequently invaded England and was declared King of England by the rebels.  Also, King John relied upon starvation rather than combat to force the rebels to surrender Rochester Castle after a siege from October 15, 1215 to November 30, 1215, but two months of starvation would make for a very dull movie.",1310256000,93,1782,4.676282051282051

There was a three year civil war and John was forced to sign the Magna Carte and give some rights to the common people. The Templers fought against the king and were very helpful in getting him to sign the Carte. A Templar is the main character in this version of history.
King John wants his full powers back and secures the backing of the Pope. He gets a mercenary Danish army to aid him. He feels that if he can take Rochester Castle, he will control the south of England and ultimately all of his country. The film focuses on the horrendous brutal battle at this castle.

4491413,4,B004X1Z14C,"Released in 2011, Ironclad is based on the real-life siege of Rochester Castle by the pompous and loathsome King John (Paul Giamatti) in 1215. In real life the castle was protected by 95 to 140 knights supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others, but in the film there are less than 20 fighting men. I suppose this keeps the social interplay in the fortress less complicated. The main protagonist is a solemn Templar, Thomas Marshal (James Purefoy), loosely based on medieval knight/statesman William Marshal. The others include the historical leader of the defense, Baron William d'Aubigny (Brian Cox), a squire (Aneurin Barnard), and various characters played by Jason Flemyng, Jamie Foreman, Rhys Parry Jones, amongst others.

I won't tell you what happens in the film, but in real life King John takes the castle and the nobles were either imprisoned or exiled. Also, the foreign mercenaries John enlists were mostly Flemish, Provenals and Aquitainians, not Danes, and the French didn't arrive until six months after John took the castle. Speaking of the Danes, they're depicted as decidedly pagan when Denmark was already thoroughly Christianized by that point. Lastly, William d'Aubigny was not an ennobled wool merchant and what happens to him at the end of the siege is fictional.

If you can handle historical deviations like these Ironclad is a very worthwhile medieval film. The action is realistic and brutal and the main characters are decent to strong. The score and cinematography are top-rate. On the womanly front, Kate Mara plays the platonic wife of Baron Reginald de Cornhill (Derek Jacobi), who becomes infatuated during the siege by the mysterious Templar. Will Marshal give-in to her feminine charms or won't he? Also on hand is Bree Condon as the utterly stunning full-maned brunette Agnes. Unfortunately, not enough is done with the women.

Although not as good as King Arthur, Tristan + Isolde and Black Death, my three favorite medieval movies, Ironclad plays better IMHO than (the overrated) Braveheart. Id put it on par with 2010s Robin Hood, Rob Roy and First Knight.

The film runs 121 minutes and was shot entirely on location in Wales, UK.

Set in the year 1215, IRONCLAD (UK/USA/Germany-2011) features Derek Jacobi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-CLAUDIUS/dp/B006JY3OHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, CLAUDIUS</a>) as Reginald de Cornhill (constable of Rochester Castle) and Paul Giamatti (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AMERICAN-SPLENDOR/dp/B0000U0X20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AMERICAN SPLENDOR</a>), who gives an impassioned performance as ""evil"" King John. Background: at Runnymede, a coalition of barons forced John to sign the Magna Carta, a document that assured certain rights to free men, including protection against arbitrary punishments of the king.

According to this highly fictionalized work by writer/director Jonathan English, King John immediately reneged on the Magna Carta's coerced promises. His campaign to retake control of southeast England, with the Pope's blessing and an assist from Danish mercenaries, is disrupted by a handful of men led by a brave knight templar (James Purefoy) who rides a white horse. Their courageous stand at strategic Rochester Castle and keep delay John's advance long enough for help to arrive from France. The rebels were beseiged for months, outnumbered a hundred to one, and most of them perished after a number of battles. The survivors witnessed their liberators' arrival, the scattering of John's forces and his retreat from the field. This all makes for engaging cinema, but reality is quite different.

The rebels within Rochester numbered about 100, not thirteen. The baron leading the castle's defense, William d'Aubigny (who's played by Brian Cox and called ""Albany"" here), wasn't maimed and then brutlly killed. He in fact lived 20 more years and became a loyalist upon the accession of Henry III. Nearly dead from starvation, history says that Aubigny's garrison surrendered to John in November 1215, after a seven week seige. John's hired pagan troops (also incorrect) never fled the field, as depicted in this film. The castle wasn't his for long, however as the barons' new leader, Prince Louis of France, captured Rochester in 1216, but long after its defenders had been removed.

.
IRONCLAD suffers from clichd techniques of modern movie-making, including distorted and spastic camera work during battle sequences, plus an over-reliance on violence and digitally-enhanced gore. Here, broadsword blows split men asunder as if they were pats of warm butter. Wounds are extra-ghastly, yet those ""good guys"" sustaining them continue doing battle until they're skewered on sword blades like so many shish kebab nuggets.

Despite these limitations, and accepting an intentionally inaccurate script, I have to admit I enjoyed this picture, and that's what really matters in the end.",1418860800,,2863,5.939320388349515

Lead by James Purefoy (very intense) and Brian Cox, it is so good to see him as the good guy. The cover blurb says ""Seven Samurai meets Braveheart"" and I agree. Who lives?

Which he in fact took after they surrendered after a 3 month siege. John was the bad guy in this story and in real life as well.  His son abided with the Magna Carta after his death and was a stable and decent king.  John wasn't all bad he created the English navy. But he was a tyrant and the siege had far more barons in the castle than just one!  To make the story more hollywoodish they focus on a small group of soldiers and such.  Why not do the real siege and have some of these cast members in that story?. And the danes were already Christianized by 1215.  SO it was a English on English battle.  Still in spite of that , it's a real gorefest and the story moves fast as they defend t he castle against king john.  Some people have compared this to the magnificent seven and they aren't far off probably.  That is historically inaccurate , but this is still historically good in a broad sense.  This is a pure savage action flick. with first class battle scenes. which are far better than most of these type of films. Watch it for that. Although Giamatti is a great King john for sure.

4491445,5,B004X1Z14C,"I have watched it many times and the authentic feel and the brutality really brings home for me a Veteran that the way we fight war tends to be very impersonal and detached.  We have snipers that compete for the longest kill; currently a Mile and a half. We have smart bombs that kill only intended targets. Targets that are never seen by the Pilot and/or bombardier. I watched footage of a tank killing another tank and several been escaped the destruction and the machine gunner had orders - no survivors so in the dark with no moon and overcast sky's, Generation 3 night vision from half a mile away he sees heat signatures and takes them down. In the middle ages we did not fight war like that.

We chopped off hands and feet in order to elicit a Desired response. We did worse than that Even when we got here to the ""New World"" we took scalps and raped women to death for nothing more than we wanted something we thought the people.  Most Native tribes did not own the land that land owned them. but we did not like this answer so we mutilated, raped and scalped to intimidate them.

It did not help because the natives did not understand the concept of owning land.  No matter how cruel we attacked our disease killed more than our swords, hatchets and muskets. In fact we taught the natives to scalp.  We paid bounties for French scalps and they paid money for English scalps.

We called what was done in the past barbaric.  We are barbarians and when it comes down to it we revert to the same tools of our forefathers, some even worse.  So don't be surprised to here we torture prisoners of war.  War is a dirty business.  That is why we want to keep it off our soil.  Trust me when I  tell you a man who has been against owning guns, comes home and finds his 3 year old son chopped in pieces and you pregnant wife naked, raped and your unborn child removed and obviously strangled with its own cord in front of your wife while she is dying, you will want a gun then.  Then you will want war. Then no price is too high.  And one day you awake and find they you have become what you went to war for.  You may deny it now, but I have seen what a simple murder can do to a man.  War turns us n to what we say we are fighting against. Poets and bards have put much of this in verse and song. Ironclad lets you see this and almost taste what we become when pushed into war.",1400457600,,2376,4.164113785557987
4491446,5,B004X1Z14C,"And it'll make you flinch, unless you're so hardened to graphic violence and torture that this sort of thing is old hat to you.

It's important to know that this movie is based on historical events and takes lots of liberties. Since we have no play-by-play narration of actual medieval events, every movie and book that goes beyond the broad stroke of history to tell a lively story, is in fact, 'based on historical events', so I don't think that's a show-stopper. More, if you have an interest in history, this movie might just get you to do some digging on your own and learn something. All to the good.

Purefoy is brilliant as the Templar, both in casting and performance, and Brian Cox adds the right touch of rakish resignation to the end that has to be coming. This movie is absolutely brutal, and that's a virtue in and of itself. Most movies gloss over the results of running-with-scissors (or swords), Ironclad brings it up close and personal. Most movies portray a medieval setting with modern sensibilities, this one gives you a glimpse into what it was more probably like.

I see some of the reviewers are hatin' on Kate Mara, and their complaints about her acting ability are fair enough. But if you consider her as what she really is; a pretty, strangely beguiling foil to showcase the conflict within the Templar Knight, she's the perfect fit for the part. She's not meant to be a main character, and she isn't.

4491452,4,B004X1Z14C,"Mix together the Seven Samurai and Gladiator, toss in actors from The Game of Thrones and Brother Cadfael, and set it in medieval times, and you've got Ironclad, a not-entirely-accurate but still quite fun romp through a castle siege.

Ironclad James Purefoy stars as the world-weary Templar knight who is just trying to get home. It's the time of the Magna Carta. Evil King John has signed away many of his rights to the nobles. Unfortunately for most of the land, Kind John isn't happy with this situation and enlists the help of a Danish army to squash the nobles who stood up against him. Purefoy gets enlisted for a last-ditch effort to hold Rochester Castle against King John long enough for the French to come and save England. All they can assemble in time is a rag-tag band of fighters, each with his own quirky personality. Including, of course, the young squire with wide, innocent eyes.

I love some of the actors in this. Derek Jacobi has long been a favorite of mine. Charles Dance - aka Tywin Lannister - is also quite good. Mackenzie Crook is another GoT member. I love the medieval setting. Sure there are a variety of issues - for example the siege at Rochester was more about starvation than battle. But they do show the starvation aspect of it, and then ""liven it up"". I've come to accept that movies aren't documentaries and take liberties to get their message across. Hopefully people who are interested then research to find out the whole truth.

And, that being said, the movie does make at least a decent effort to show medieval life for what it was. It wasn't neat and tidy. People didn't wear polyester suits and dance on pristine floors. There was dirt and grime. Running out of food was a real concern in a day without refrigerators and long-distance trucking. But, that being said, these were not ""foreign aliens."" They had the same hopes and fears, loves and goals, that we have today, just from a slightly different vantage point. The woman of the castle wants love and respect. The knight wishes the fighting could come to an end but is willing to do what needs to be done to keep others safe. Jacobi's character is caught between loyalties. There are very few ""pure evil"" or ""pure good"" characters here - they each have their burdens to bear.

The swordfighting scenes are generally well done - a combination of soldiers who were well trained in the art and also real men who did what it took to win a fight. It wasn't always elegant and pretty. Sometimes it was rough and tumble. The swordmaster here was Richard Ryan, who also handled this task for Troy. Note that, for the squeamish, there are some fairly gory parts to the story.

Related to that, and related to the notion that how we see things now is perhaps different from how medieval people saw things, in one scene the Lady of the castle, Lady Isabel, comes to flirt with the knight. She says, in essence, ""it would be useful if you taught me how to wield a sword so I could defend myself."" Most of us modern people would say ""absolutely"" - and given the siege that soon ensues we'd perhaps have been right. But the knight instead says, ""the reason I wield it is so you never have to deal with the burden of killing others."" This was the way most medieval folk viewed the world. As the siege progresses, the men discuss, quite seriously, that they'll kill off the women before the invaders come in. This is the same style of dialogue featured in Game of Thrones during the assault on the castle. Women weren't expected to defend themselves - they were pure and separate from those violent situations. They were to be protected at all costs - even if it meant they died rather than face the situation. So a quite rational view from medieval point of view and sensibility. For some of us modern watchers, we have a different view on men and women, and our reaction might differ :).

I also don't watch films for accurate history lessons but I like when films introduce me to an occurrence from history about which I was unaware.  I was unaware of the events that occurred following the signing of the Magna Carta and will study the period more now.  Ironclad delivered on all those levels.

Paul Giamatti's brutal performance as King John was a pleasant surprise, revealing a side of his talent I had not seen previously.  James Purefoy knows how to play supremely confident characters perfectly.  His internal struggle in the film between his faith, duty, experience, and desire was enjoyable to watch, demonstrated with the tiniest inflections.  Brian Cox, Charles Dance, and Derek Jacobi played solid period roles.  Jamie Foreman was the entertaining scene stealer in the movie.  Watch it and you'll know why.  Kate Mara, an actress I enjoy, seemed miscast in the film.  She played her part adequately enough, even adding a bit of accent, but as gritty as the film and time period was her character seemed Scotchgarded; dirt didn't stick to her at all!

As others have mention the film is physically brutal.  Expect that going in and there will be no surprises.  The shaky camera technique to hide the pre-placement of the battle injuries got a bit tedious but it was effective.

The Blu-ray transfer is perfect.  The description on Amazon shows a 1.77 aspect ratio and Dolby sound.  It is actually a 2.35 letterbox aspect ratio and English DTS-HD Master Audio.

4491457,4,B004X1Z14C,"I actually expected much less of this film when I dropped it in the player, but I was pleasantly surprised. Mostly because it is actually pretty historically accurate. It *is* a movie, so you *have* to have some poetic license to make people even want to watch it, but for the most part, things actually happened the way they are portrayed - Magna Carta was signed that way, the Pope did back the king against the archbishop, King John did hire mercenaries (though not fake ""Danes"" speaking fake Danish), Rochester castle was defended by one of the barons and a small force of men (though not 20, rather 120), they did face starvation during the siege (but for seven weeks, not months), captured traitors did get their hands and feet cut off, they did barrage the keep with siege engines, the keep was undermined that way, one of the towers did fall that way (King Henry rebuilt it, but round instead of square), they did manage to defend the ruins even after the tower fell, and even some of the wording of the king's lines are lifted straight from the mediaeval chronicles.

The ending (of course) is a bit compressed in time to make it a Hollywood ending - the French didn't arrive ""just in time"" like the cavalry, actually King John took the castle (the defenders gave up due to starvation (but were all spared, save for one)), and it wasn't retaken by the French until a few months later.

4491464,3,B004X1Z14C,"Sometimes a girl just wants to watch a movie composed almost entirely of men killing each other in variously gory and disturbing ways. If you're in the mood for such a thing, then ""Ironclad"" will scratch that itch.

Based on real events, though naturally playing fast and loose with history in nearly all other respects, we open with a short introduction that delineates the forthcoming conflict. It's 1215 and the rebel barons of England have just forced King John to sign the Magna Carter, the document that limits his power and protects their rights. Yet within a few months of putting his signature to the paper, John goes back on his word and assembles a mercenary army of Danes to bring both barons and country back under his rule.

Standing in the way is Rochester Castle, a strategically placed fortress that Baron William D'Aubergny swears to hold against John's mercenaries, gathering together a motley band of seven warriors to defend it until their French allies turn up. Among them is Thomas Marshal, a Knight Templar whose bloody history in the Crusades have led him to a vow of silence and chastity, something that is duly broken once he lays eyes on the Lord of Rochester's young wife. Surrounding him are the usual suspects in this type of movie: the naive young squire, the grizzled warrior, the womanizing sword-for-hire, the marksman, and the guy who tags along because their leader pays his way out of the stocks.

Seven heroes? Impossible odds? Siege tactics? Yeah, you've seen this set-up a million times before, but that doesn't mean that the formula of Akira Kurosawi's seminal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Samurai/dp/B004D1CK32/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Samurai</a>&nbsp;isn't still as fresh now as it was back in the 1950s, as the never-ending stream of imitators has proved. And there's a rather astonising array of talent on display: James Purefoy, Brian Cox, Derek Jacobi, Paul Giamatti, Charles Dance... we may never know how they managed to get themselves roped into this, but they all throw themselves into their roles and manage to elevate the script with each performance. Giamatti's over-the-top hysterical meltdown as Prince John confronts the rebels is indeed a sight to behold. Would a film featuring Paul Giamatti be complete without one?

Also involved is Jayson Fleming and MacKenzie Crook (you know, those actors who pop up absolutely *everywhere*, though you can never remember where you've seen them before), and the as-yet unknown Aneurin Barnard. Keep your eye on him, for I suspect he'll be cracking the big time soon. Also on board is Kate Mara, given the thankless task of requisite love interest. Hey, I'm a woman. I like to see a sister hold her own in these types of movies, even if it's just heating hot oil or sharpening weapons. But Lady Isabel is given absolutely nothing to do but partake in a tedious romantic subplot with Thomas, taking any opportunity she can to try and seduce him, even when there are far more important things going on (like say, the slow and gruesome death of one of their men outside). Every time she appears the film grounds to a halt.

Historians may well be reduced to tears by this film's depiction of the Siege of Rochester, though my philosophy is that dramatic license may well spur viewers into seeking out the historical realities of what really happened when films choose to ""loosely base"" their plots on true stories. Just off the top of my head, inaccuracies include: the complete absence of Rochester Cathedral beside the keep, the death of William D'Aubergny, the paganism of the Danish (and the fact that many seem to speak fluent Hungarian), the presence of Marshal's two-handed longsword, and - perhaps most amusingly - the fact that the historical defenders of the castle eventually surrendered to Prince John after starvation drove them out. Prince Louis of France would not arrive until several months later.

There's some gorgeous cinematography at work in what otherwise seems to be an effort to keep everything looking as grim and miserable as possible (with the exception of Lady Isabel's shiny hair and laughably anachronistic battle attire), and a rousing soundtrack as well. As mentioned, the Thomas/Isabel love affair is a misfire, but it's in the action sequences that the the film excels. Despite the dreaded ""shaky-cam"", there is an energy to the fighting that gives the impression that these guys are genuinely trying to hack each other to bits instead of simply going through the motions of a choreographed fight. And when the time comes to hew off limbs, hack off hands and saw off tongues, I can assure you that there is no stinting on all the gory details.

In short, it's a wildly inaccurate portrayal of one of England's most famous sieges, filled with thinly-sketched characters who are identifiable mainly by the actors playing them. But if you came for the gore and the violence (as well as an increasingly rare depiction of a Knight Templar as one of the good guys) it delivers - and does so on a surprisingly limited budget.",1386201600,,5108,5.030732860520095

4491469,4,B004X1Z14C,"Every year Hollywood puts out a handful of action movies based in medieval Europe.  Many of these have some science fiction or fantasy blended into them, such as Season of the Witch, the LOTR trilogy, and Willow.  Then there are the occasional ones that are gritty and bloody, focusing on the history and personal drama.  Great examples of the latter include Braveheart, Rob Roby, and now this film based on the uprising against King John and his attempts to crush it.  Taking part in the castles and villages of medieval England, the movie follows several former crusaders of the Knights Templar order as they cross the country in a political chess match against a resurgent King John.  The latter has brought in a small army of knights from continental Europe to help him subdue the English aristocracy.  Along the way we see great sword fights with limbs getting cut of, people getting stabbed, torture, and fistfights to the finish.  The climax occurs at Rochester Castle as the Knights Templar fight off multiple waves of invaders long enough for help to arrive and drive of King John.  Watching this movie reminded me a little of the Seven Samurai classic from Japan, and the multiple incarnations of it in American cinema.  I arrive at this conclusion due to the fact that the few Knights Templar kill of probably over a hundred armed opponents in displays of fighting prowess.  This is probably the biggest drawback of an otherwise great film.",1380931200,,1451,4.838056680161944

4491473,3,B004X1Z14C,"Why did you like Braveheart?  If it was because of closeup shots of limbs getting hacked and heads getting squashed like mellons, then you'll love this movie.  The limb hacking has been dialed up to eleven.  But if you liked Braveheart because of the acting, convincing dialogue, of epic scope, then look elsewhere.  The dialogue is okay.  The acting is sufficient, I guess.  Brian Cox and Tywin from the Game of Thrones both do decent jobs with some mild drama.  Paul Giamatti does a lot of yelling and some brooding, and is pretty entertaining.  The mousy girl from House of Cards has an ill-concieved role, in which she is unable to keep it in her pants even during a siege.

The epic scope is where this film fails hardest.  Supposedly there's a battle where twenty men fought a thousand, yet it seems more like six guys fighting against fifteen or twenty.  Also, one look at the castle and you'd know that there's no way for twenty men to hold it.  They've got only two defenders fighting on each wall while attackers continually climb over.  A couple dozen men die and then the attackers retreat.  Maybe 100 men could hold the castle against a larger force, but that would have required a bigger budget.  Nothing here is very plausible.  Not historically accurate either, but that's a different complaint.

But if all you want is to watch guys with swords stomping through the mud and either hacking off limbs or getting their own hacked off, then this is the perfect movie for you.  Especially if you loved the torturous ending of Braveheard, you'll enjoy a particularly sadistic scene which seems like 5 minutes of a man being held down and having each of his limbs severed, one after another.

The action scenes were frantic and made it near impossible to focus in on anything for more than half a second.  The non action scenes had characters partially out of frame.

4491480,4,B004X1Z14C,"Set in the year 1215, IRONCLAD (UK/USA/Germany-2011) features Derek Jacobi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-CLAUDIUS/dp/B001FRNB9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, CLAUDIUS</a>) as Reginald de Cornhill (constable of Rochester Castle) and Paul Giamatti (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AMERICAN-SPLENDOR/dp/B0000U0X20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AMERICAN SPLENDOR</a>), who gives an impassioned performance as ""evil"" King John. Background: at Runnymede, a coalition of barons forced John to sign the Magna Carta, a document that assured certain rights to free men, including protection against arbitrary punishments of the king.

According to this highly fictionalized work by writer/director Jonathan English, King John immediately reneged on the Magna Carta's coerced promises. His campaign to retake control of southeast England, with the Pope's blessing and an assist from Danish mercenaries, is disrupted by a handful of men led by a brave knight templar (James Purefoy) who rides a white horse. Their courageous stand at strategic Rochester Castle and keep delay John's advance long enough for help to arrive from France. The rebels were beseiged for months, outnumbered a hundred to one, and most of them perished after a number of battles. The survivors witnessed their liberators' arrival, the scattering of John's forces and his retreat from the field. This all makes for engaging cinema, but reality is quite different.

The rebels within Rochester numbered about 100, not thirteen. The baron leading the castle's defense, William d'Aubigny (who's played by Brian Cox and called ""Albany"" here), wasn't maimed and then brutlly killed. He in fact lived 20 more years and became a loyalist upon the accession of Henry III. Nearly dead from starvation, history says that Aubigny's garrison surrendered to John in November 1215, after a seven week seige. John's hired pagan troops (also incorrect) never fled the field, as depicted in this film. The castle wasn't his for long, however as the barons' new leader, Prince Louis of France, captured Rochester in 1216, but long after its defenders had been removed.

.
IRONCLAD suffers from clichd techniques of modern movie-making, including distorted and spastic camera work during battle sequences, plus an over-reliance on violence and digitally-enhanced gore. Here, broadsword blows split men asunder as if they were pats of warm butter. Wounds are extra-ghastly, yet those ""good guys"" sustaining them continue doing battle until they're skewered on sword blades like so many shish kebab nuggets.

Despite these limitations, and accepting an intentionally inaccurate script, I have to admit I enjoyed this picture, and that's what really matters in the end.",1373673600,2,2787,5.977443609022556

Storyline: Knights rebel against the mad King and hold up in a castle. Majority of the movie is the Knights, and others, defending Rochester Castle against the King and his hired army.

Action: Lots of blood and guts. Good fight/sword scenes. Lots of body parts get chopped.

Actors: They do a pretty good job. There are several top notch actors roaming around in this movie. Derek Jacobi, Charles Dance (Pappa Lannister from ""Game Of Thrones"") also star in this movie.

Adult scenes: Almost none. I remember seeing breast briefly in the beginning.

Costumes/Sets/etc: Nothing looked cheap nor ""B"" rated. The castles, costumes, scenery all looked as it should for this type movie.

Overall, this movie was much better than I expected and it kept my attention from beginning to end. I wanted to see the ""good guys"" win. I will admit, if not for the ""blood and guts"" action, this movie would not have kept my attention for very long. The King was a good villain, you really want to dislike him.

4491495,4,B004X1Z14C,"The Amazon description says this is a true story. Well, sort of. There is a Rochester Castle. King John did sign the Magna Carta and then kind of reneged. A bunch of pesky barons did make his life miserable. And there was a siege. The devil is in the details.

""Ironclad"" is a glorious paen to the days of old when knights were bold and their swords were meant for cleaving.  An opening narration informs us us that King John was a nasty little wretch whose only accomplishments were losing battles with the French, levying punitive taxes, and sleeping with the wives of his barons.  Eventually, we are told, the barons had enough and after a 3 year civil war, handed the king the Magna Carta, a document which severely limited his powers to declare war on France, tax punitively, and sleep with their women.

In the first scene, we see Paul Giamatti as King John holding a pen and hesitating over the odious document. The Baron of Albany (played by Brian Cox, that wonderful bulldog in human guise) swaggers up to the King and tells him to step on it, sign the damn thing, quit stalling.  The King does as he is told, but you can see he doesn't like it.  Next thing you know, he is reneging, having hired a bunch of Danish thugs led by a blonde giant in bearskins with the World's Biggest Battleax to take back his kingdom and wreak havoc upon those who tried to limit his Divine Right.

The Baron of Albany (and they could have called him Duke of Earl or Count of Basie, because there was no such person...the Magna Carta was signed in 1215, and the title did not even come into existence for another 200 years or so), decides the king needs to be stopped, so he gathers six comrades from prior battles and takes over the strategic Castle Rochester.  Apparently you cannot rule England unless you have control of that particular castle. Why?  Didn't we just say it was 'strategic?'  That seems to be reason enough.  A better question is: Why did the Baron decide to fight off the King's Army plus all those hired Danish guys with The Gang of Seven.  I guess you can't remake The Magnificent Seven with an army of 3,000, so it's best we just let it go.  Anyway the Baron has an ace up his sleeve. Sort of.  ""The French will relieve us,"" he tells his men.  ""They are sending an army and bringing us a New King. We must hold Rochester Castle until they arrive.""  Oh yeah.  Wait for the French to save you. There's a plan.  And why a new French king is going to be better for England than the old English king also remains unexplained.

The Baron of Albany's posse consists of one Knight Templar, one doe-eyed young boy squire who is given the task of protecting the Magna Carta, one Big Oaf who, naturally, takes the lad under his wing and teaches him mayhem, and assorted other lovable, embittered, noble and brave stereotypes whom we have met in every other movie of this type.  The scenes where the Baron collects the group are well done...every bit as good as the ones we are familiar with from ""Seven Samurai,"" ""The Magnificent Seven,"" et alia.

The B of A and the Boys march into Rochester Castle and inform the landlord, Baron de Cornhill (Derek Jacobi), that they are going to war against the king, everyone will probably die a hideous and agonizing death if they don't starve to death first in the inevitable siege, and oh, by the way, is that your lovely and much younger and rather sex starved wife over there? De Cornhill is not thrilled, but what can he do?  He's all worn out from avoiding having sex with his young, beautiful wife -- it takes a lot out of him.

The wife, Lady Isabel (played somewhat sedately by Kate Mara), takes one look at Matthew, the studly and celibate Knight Templar played by the mouth-watering James Purefoy (Purefox) and says ""Daddy, buy me that.""  But alas, Matthew has, like all Knights Templar, taken that pesky Vow of Chastity, so he hitches up his knightly skirt and runs like a rabbit. Never has a woman had to work so hard to get so little.  Me, I'd have gone for Brian Cox (the only man on the planet who can make short, acne-scarred, fat and grizzled look gorgeous) or the Big Oaf guy. I mean, who needs baggage?

Anyway, back to the Castle and the scheduled siege.  We do get a nice tour of the property and learn some interesting things about defending a pile of rocks in the middle of nowhere.  A moat is essential, for one thing. Not having one is a headache from the getgo.  We learn what's so good about a portcullis, why the drawbridge became popular, why castles have keeps, why seeing a big bunch of pigs at a siege is bad news for a castle's defenders, how to build a siege engine, and why a very well-stocked pantry is a good idea.  Later we  learn what kind of a noise body makes when it is flung via catapault against the castle wall. In case you were wondering.

The Defenders and another 20 or so men at arms who were already at the castle do a remarkable Masada like job of fending off 1,000 of the king's men, time and time again.  The fighting scenes are wonderfully gory, with men not just hacked into chunks, but creatively cleaved in two, from top to bottom, side to side and, by way of variety, on the diagonal.

But things don't work out very well for the Baron and his boys. After almost a year, the food is gone, they are starving and cold...but they are still resolved to wait for the French (who apparently are crossing the channel on innertubes. ""Hold the Castle...never surrender"" exhorts the Baron again and again. His hungry, wounded and exhausted men display great forebearance and do not smack him and tell him to shut his pie hole.

Semi-Spoiler Alert:  Well, about now King John decides to get really stinky. He not only pulls off a sneak attack, but also mines the castle (this is where the pigs come in, but I'm not spoiling the surprise...go get your own siege if you want to learn their purpose).  The glorious and noble Baron of Albany falls and is captured, giving King John the opportunity to do some really, really mean things to him. (As if we didn't already hate him. Remember, this is the same guy who gave Robin Hood so much grief. Even A.A. Milne, that nice man who wrote Winnie the Pooh had nothing good to say about the guy: ""King John was not a good man, and no good friends had he..."")

More of the semi-Spoiler Alert:  The castle falls, but Marshall-the-Knight-Templar and the girl and the doe-eyed lad survive. The knight (who gave up his vow of celibacy a while ago) and the girl ride off, the Doe-eyed lad shouts ""We Held"" to his dead but still much beloved Baron. A little while later, the French finally arrived. They stood around looking silly for a while and then when no one was looking, they went back home to France and pretended the whole thing never happened. One can still see them there to this day, standing around and looking silly in their natural habitat. King John got dysentary and died, and his son got to be king.

You know, I'm thinking maybe the spoiler alerts were unneccesary...I mean, who in their right mind is still reading?. We're at what...one million words?  Even if you tried, you probably died of old age aleady. Or ennui.  And still, amazingly, I'm not finished.

There is a Rochester Castle. It was the scene of a rather famous siege during the First Barons' War (1215-1217) in King John's reign, but the siege only lasted for seven weeks. The castle defenders were led by Baron William d'Aubigny but the movie subtitles clearly say 'Baron of Albany,' so I went with that title. Albany? Aubigny? Doesn't matter. Either way, he did not get captured nor was he tortured by King John. I think he just went home with everybody else when they ran out of food.

The movie is entertaining, loud, bloody, and full of the kind of Heroics that are good to see every now and then. Four stars for some good actors who did the best they could with what they had.",1368144000,8,7888,4.447916666666667

Some of the comments I've read on other reviews are spot on the mark. Massive amounts of slo-mo violence for little reason other than - oh yes, it's about knights and war, so it must have to be violent! Wait a minute. Isn't a film supposed to have a decent storyline? Not this one, clearly.

Don't get me wrong. I love the premise of a film set in the early 13th century; one with knights, great big battles, 'bad' King John and the Magna Carta; barons who want to rein in his cruel rule.

Instead, we have a risible King John, fighting with an American accent the whole way through the film. That's when he's not throwing temper tantrums in a high pitched voice redolent of Walt Disney's Robin Hood, or stamping his foot like a toddler. The main female actress spends her time swooning over Purefoy, finding plenty of locations in a tiny castle to be alone with him. The mercenaries employed by King John are 'Danes' - Viking rip offs of the cartoon variety. And then we get to the fact that there are only seven men defending a castle against more than a thousand. Seven - like the Magnificent Seven - except this lot are really mediocre. Yet still they manage to hold out for many months. I know that one has to suspend disbelief in films, but not to this extent - and that's just one example.

Don't get me started on the history either. The stories of the time are amazing, and need little changing to make a great film. Why use fictitious Danes? Why pretend that so few men can defend a castle when in fact it was taken by King John? Why make out that after his death that things went back to the way they were, when in fact his son took the throne?

What a shame I wasted my money on this bilge. Avoid.

4491516,3,B004X1Z14C,"""Ironclad"" is a gory historical epic loosely based on a historical event - the attack of Rochester Castle by the armies of King John (intense Paul Giamatti), who was forced to sign Magna Carta in 1215. In the film, feeling humiliated by his subject England's feudal barons, and the Knights Templar who supported them, the king hires Danish mercenaries and lays siege to the castle which is a key strategic point in the region. A Templar knight Thomas Marshall (James Purefoy) and baronial rebellion leader William d'Aubigny (Brian Cox) recruit a ragtag group of fighters and protect the castle, while they are hopelessly outnumbered by the king's army.

There are several major combat scenes, and considering the film's obvious budget constraints, they are impressive. You have to wait pretty long time before each battle begins, but once it does, the film delivers. The hack and slash combat scenes are bloody and violent, and by doing so the film makes a point there is no glory in dying or killing, without losing sight of entertainment value. The camera is sometimes a bit too shaky, but the battle scenes are very good.

Over the course of its two hours, however, ""Ironclad"" lulls at times when following the weak subplot of love romance between Marshal and Lady Isabel (Kate Mara), a young, rebellious wife of Reginald de Cornhill (Derek Jacobi) in charge of the castle. Isabel's presence does not add much to the story and the character of Marshal that could have been more interesting.

The film also includes three veteran actors Brian Cox, Charles Dance and Derek Jacobi. They would have given a dramatic edge to the rather predictable film, but their skills and charisma remain underused.

As a historical drama ""Ironclad"" needs much to be desired, lacking dramatic impact and credible character development. As a historical action movie the film is pretty good with intense combat sequences.",1349222400,,1903,5.012658227848101

hero, a Knight Templar with a weakening belief in his faith. I notice that some reviewers

4491521,3,B004X1Z14C,"What are you looking for in a DVD about the siege of Rochester that took place in 1215, after some of King John's barons rebelled against him? A historically accurate story? Good actors who perform in ways that make their characters look realistic? A lot of savage but realistic fighting? All three or none of the above? Depending on your answers to these questions (and perhaps a few others), you will either love or hate this film, or anything in between.

First, does it accuratly tell the story of the siege of Rochester during which John and his army mostly made up of mercenaries besieged a handful of rebels for several weeks? The answer to this one is both yes and no. The rebels were indeed commanded by Baron William d'Albani, one of the feudal lords that had signed Magna Carta, but there were a couple of hundred of them and many knights among them, as opposed to the handful shown in the film. The presence of a Templar Knight is a pure invention as is having the Templars siding with the rebels against King John. In all likelihood, and since the Knights Templars answered to the Pope, who happened to take King John's side after a piece of skillful diplomacy from the King (who was as useless as he generally is made to be), they are very unlikely to have sided with the rebels. In fact, one of the only Templars mentioned in the sources is one Brother Roger who was used by John to distribute money to the King's mercenaries as and when they landed on the South coast of England to reinforce his army. A related point, concerning John forces, is that these were mostly made up of mercenaries who came from just about everywhere from France (there were Bretons, Gascon crossbowmen, Poitevins and Flemish, among others) but certainly not from Scandinavia or the Isles (whether the Orkneys or the Hebrides), as the film seems to imply, and, of course, they were not commanded by one ""Tiberius"" - a character that is just as fictional as that of the main hero in the film (the Templar Knight). In fact the whole film is a mix of historically correct pieces and others that are not at all historical. The undermining of the walls and of one of the towers is mostly accurate (except for the 40 pigs whose fat was used to set of the mine and which were not burned alive) did happen and King John did have the castle relentlessly bombarded by 5 siege machines for weeks. Some of our hero's equipment is rather anachronistic, such as his two-handed sword which did not come into use before another century or so, or the type of helmet (heaume) that he wears in the film some 50 years to early. Finally, the real story ended in a rather less dramatic way: the defenders finally surrendered and King John, after having had had a couple of them mutilated and executed (but none of them were knights) had the rest of them emprisoned in his various castles and held for ransom, including William d'Albani.

Now many potential customers either do not care too much about historical accuracy, meaning they might not care a rat's behind about it, in more straighforward terms, or at least they do not object when such a film is somewhat inaccurate, as long as the actors are good, the story holds together and it is action-packed with masses of fighting. Regarding actors' performances, I am afraid the film is a bit of a mixed bag, to put it nicely. Some actors, such as Paul Giamatti playing King John tend to make their character look somewhat ridiculous. Even our blue-eyed Templar, who will, of course, go off into the sunset after having renounced his Order with the conveniently widowed landlady, is a bit of a caricature and the normally excellent Derek Jacobi is a shadow of his usual self in this film. So, definitly not a film that would be on the short list for the Oscar of Best Actor.

What is left is a series of savage fights where the Director has - at times - gone rather overboard and attempted to make the story as gory as possible. So, expect masses of limbs being chopped of more or less unrealistically, and a tongue being cut out from an old priest towards the beginning of the film. There is even a case where one of the defenders during the siege picks up a cut off limb and uses it as a club against the besiegers. At this point, I confess I could not stop laughing.

However, even as a caricature, I still somehow managed to find the film entertaining and I have even seen it a couple of times since I bought it a while ago. Nothing to really write home about, perhaps, but still entertaining and enjoyable. Because of that, it is worth three stars for me.",1339545600,,4583,4.5048076923076925

What a group: Bryan Cox (in a lead role, I am happy to say), Paul Giamatti, Derek Jacoby and the truly splendid, James Purefoy.  Great cast, great story - what could go wrong?  Weak, weak screenplay.  The sets were incredibly realistic and all the actors seemed to be working so hard, but there was absolutely no emotional punch - AT ALL.  The fight scenes were vivid and well-staged, but I found myself rooting for ACTORS rather than CHARACTERS.  About the only good thing I can say about the screenplay is that it kept the focus of the story narrow; it didn't veer off into a bunch of muddy secondary storylines.  There was a weak love-interest storyline involving James Purefoy's Knight Templar character, but it added nothing to the film - except of course, to see the gorgeous Purefoy ""in action"" somewhat.

4491525,2,B004X1Z14C,"As with most modern `action' movies it is heavy on the violence but weak in the plotline and in any good quality acting. All of the `memorable' lines seemed like recycled clichs from other movies as did the `moral dilemmas' of the characters. The beautiful young girl trapped in loveless marriage of convenience to older man formula has been used and re-used dozens of times.

The costumes were very good, and there were a lot of good actors, but I do not feel they were at their best. Purefoy's character Thomas, a Templar turned pacifist with religious doubts was unoriginal and lacked depth or any real conviction. Making out the men of the Crusading orders to have been brainwashed drones subservient to an oppressive and militantly extremist ideology was clearly an attempt to be `relevant' but it simply did not ring true.

As a Cadfael fan I was thrilled to see Derek Jacobi in this film, but his character was very much on the side-lines and was relegated to a type casted nasty fat cowardly old man who was always harassing his wife. His suicide for no apparent reason seemed like little more than a neat and predictable plot device intended to allow Isabel his wife and Thomas to have their happy ending.

The heroine Isabel herself was annoying and simply unnecessary. She behaved like a stroppy teenager most of the time, always pouting, whining and saying no when told to do something. This was supposed to make her look 'independent' but really is just made her seem like an argumentative 14 year old. When it came to her 'relationship' with Thomas she simply behaved like a spoiled selfish brat who sulked, had tantrums and hurled insults at Tom until she got what she wanted from him- regardless of his own wishes and desires.

I generally have no particular objection to some unrealistic content in movies it if adds to the story, but Isabel's inclusion in the main battle scene wielding a sword was simply laughable, when a few scenes earlier she could scarcely even pick up the weapon, and she had no opportunity to practice using it. Yet by some miracle she outdoes seasoned soldiers and a squire who has been training for years with her skilled use of said sword minutes later.

Also, for the entire 90 odd minutes of the movie  Isabel  sports waist length loose hair despite the fact that this would just get in the way all the time and prove to a nuisance-  the only apparent reason for this was because as the 'love interest' she had to look beautiful and have maximum sex-appeal.

Of course then she had to be included in battle scenes to avoid offending feminist sensibilities and make sure she was being cast as more than just a sex object for the boys to ogle - that and to ensure that she had something to do other than look sexy for the entire duration of the movie.

The character of King John was more than just the usual tyrant. For some reason the film-makers decided to depict him as a 'godly' tyrant who was a model of religious piety anc claimed a divine mandate for his actions. Nothing could be further from the Historical John- who was the only English monarch to be excommunicated before the reformation. Thus the depiction of John in the movie may well have been another attempt to be 'relevant' to the part of the movie-makers by trying to cast King John as a theocratic dictator driven by fanatical religious fervour like the ones who exist today.

The presentation of Magna Carta as a Medieval 'Bill of Rights' which was intended to free people from the bonds of tyranny, and thus the siege of Rochester as the war which preceded it as some kind of 'war of Independence' seems to have been an attempt to pander to American sympathies- but to do this the movie makers had to give the characters and narrator a level of historical foresight that people at the time would unlikely have had, and impose modern standards upon them.

My final gripe is that whilst it is rightfully stated that King John died of dysentery in 1216, it is also wrongfully claimed that King of France took the English throne after him, when in fact the Barons of England made John's son Henry King. This historical error is likely to confuse and mislead people whilst being totally unnecessary to the storyline. So why include it at all?

Sadly this is another movie that fails because the makers have tried to make a shallow gore-fest into something serious by inserting superficial political and 'moral' themes whilst climbing onto their high horse to self-righteously condemn 'social evils' and promote their own ideology.",1334361600,5,4543,4.677944862155388

In the year 1215, the rebel barons of England have forced the despised and tyrannical King John (Paul Giamatti) to put his name and royal seal on the Magna Carta, a document that upholds the rights of free-men. But with his signature barely dry, John seeks to assemble a mercenary army to bring the rebels to heel, in defiance of his agreement with the common folk. In Rome, the Pope upholds John's claim to the throne, leaving the Archbishop of London (Charles Dance) in defiance when he sends orders that a pivotal castle that controls much of England is to be defended by the Holy Templers. Having lost their prelate to John's barbarity, the remaining Templers provide a distraction so that their leader Marshal (James Purefoy) can escape. Together with the rebel baron Albany (Brian Cox) and an assortment of knights and fighters, Marshal rides to defend the mighty Rochester castle from invasion.

Once there, he finds a certain amount of reluctance toward loyalty in the occupying tenant (Derek Jacobi) whose celibate marriage to the much younger Isabel (Kate Mara) has left her deeply unhappy. But her curiosity toward the Knights Templar is the least of Marshal's problems, as he attempts to defend a castle with twenty men against thousands. From a cinematic perspective, this movie is excellent. It has a surprisingly good cast for being so little known and absolutely beautiful costume design. The execution is skillful and it creates a sense of ominous dread and nobility in its leading characters and their plight. But when it comes to history, this poorly represents actual events, mangling everything from the invading army to how long the siege lasted. It may peak your interest enough to read about the real deal, but also disappoint in the sense that the real story is just as cinematic as the fictional one. It did a marvelous job of making me both like and dislike Isabel in the sense that I enjoyed her as a person, but did not care for her providing an intentional temptation to Marshal, whose vows to the church include celibacy.

In terms of acting, this had a great amount of talent and everyone's contribution is stellar, particularly Giamatti as the resentful King John. I had an inkling early on that this would make an excellent addition to any Robin Hood-leaning movie collections out there but was soon proven wrong with the carnage. Toned down, I would have liked it a great deal more -- but in the end, I found myself fast-forwarding through all the battle scenes. War is hell, but that doesn't mean I want to wallow through it.",1332892800,,2777,4.745341614906832
4491527,2,B004X1Z14C,"I have to be honest. I watched this purely to see James Purefoy, but with Giamatti and a good backstory, I figured it would be at least fairly entertaining. Nah, not so much. I think if you are going to do history, you do history. This faux history crap just was too unbelievable to keep me entertained. Then you have this worthless love interest. I get why the filmmakers figured they had to put it in (because sex sells and you have to have a hot chick in a dark, bloody movie, right?), but if you are going to do it, do it right. This was just silly. I gave it two stars because it did have the dark and gritty look you'd expect from a movie of this time period and despite the horrible story, Purefoy did a great job. :)",1332374400,5,724,4.105633802816901
4491528,2,B004X1Z14C,"I just finished reenacting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor using no more than two bowls of butterscotch pudding, a hyper active Pomeranian and a garden hose.  The end result was both more historically accurate and visually appealing than Ironclad.  Good Lord, people!  Would it have hurt that badly to read a book before making the film?  The blurb on the back of the case claimed this to be the meeting of Seven Samurai and Braveheart.  I will assume that the cast of each movie was on a separate train, one moving east, the other west, on a single track at maximum velocity.  That would explain, at least to some extent, this train wreck disguised as a film...

It had it's moments, hence the two stars.  Paul Giamatti was, in a word, superb.  Brian Cox was able to make the purile nonsense written for him actually sound good.  That, my friend, is acting of the first order!  Purefoy was as good as the medium would allow him to be and Vladimir Kulich, despite the poorness of the script, costuming, fight choreography and direction, was actually subtle and masterful.  Unfortunately it wasn't enough to make the film even marginally worth watching.

Where to begin?  Historical accuracy?  The film resembled the actual course of events in so much as there really was a place called England in which a man named John was king and in which his barons were in revolt against him over the small matter of a document called the Great Charter and, during said revolt, a castle known as Rochester was besieged.  Other names used in the film were used as names at the time of this revolt as well.  That's it.  That is the sum of historical fact contained in the bloody film.  ""The British Crown now belongs to a French Prince.""  In 1216....  Well, the Plantagenet dynasty was, technically, French...  Norman/Angevin anyway.  But in no fashion whatsoever in the manner implied in this epic flop.  Sigh.  I could go on for hours, but I'll move on instead.

Costuming:  Purefoy and Giamatti looked surprisingly period.  Otherwise it was a mess.  Did anyone else notice that the ""Danes"" were all wearing the cast off red-lined, fur-trimmed, black quilted gambesons from the original Conan movies?  Watch 'em side by side and see!  Some years ago the BBC ran a Robin Hood series for which ""Norman"" helmets were manufactured that have a brass central ridge running from brow to nape to cover the seam where the two halves are joined.  These unfortunate head pieces looked inaccurate and incredibly cheap back then and neither age nor familiarity (they have appeared in everything from Braveheart to The Messenger since) has made them one whit more acceptable. And these two examples are the high points of the costuming!  Mara?  Good lord.  Her costuming was taken from the Rivendell printing of the Victoria's Secrets catalogue....  Did anyone in the costume department take a moment to look at one decent authority on period clothing and armor?  One of the Osprey books illustrated by Angus McBride, for example?  Nope.  That would have led to a film with some color in it.  We all know, don't we, that the medieval period was monochrome, right?  Except for blue woad, that is.  Which the Danes were noted for using.  In fact it still figures prominently in all levels of Danish life...  (Did my sarcasm show?  Sorry.)

Fight Choreography:  Dreck.  That's it.  Just dreck.  They could have had a member of ARMA (Association of Renaissance Martial Arts) in to consult, or - better still - Mike Loades,  but they might have had to pay attention to him concerning the usage of weapons during the period so better not.  What a sodding mess the fights were.  Gratuitous blood and gore with no sense of realism or immediacy what so ever.  Gods, but I am so sick of the shaky cam effect.  Take the time to train your actors properly and choreograph the fights realistically and you won't have to try and cover the amateur nature of your production with ""artistic"" use of the camera.  (Or maybe you should just limit your cameraman's caffeine intake so he isn't quite so jittery...)

And now for the reason behind the title of this review:  ""How's your faith now, Templar?""  ""Why don't you come a little closer,"" (Zhwing) ""and I'll show you!""  Cue bad 70's porn soundtrack....  Freud would have a field day with that one!

I wanted to like the film.  I really did.  There just aren't enough (any) accurate medieval films out there.  When the hype started and the early releases from the production stressed the efforts at realism, I was thrilled.  In the end it was a mediocre effort at best.  The script was flawed, the acting uneven and the direction highly questionable.  Add to that the monochrome palette and lighting and top it with a total disregard for anything even remotely approaching factual treatment, and what we have is just another cheap B grade fantasy film.  Sorry, folks.  Do yourself a favor and just set fire to a $10 bill.  You'll get more entertainment value for your money than if you spend it on this DVD....",1330732800,7,5021,4.723699421965318
4491529,3,B004X1Z14C,"The historical premise of the movie is a good one: it is 1215, and King John of England is out for bloody revenge after being forced to sign the Magna Carta. As he murders his way across southern England, a stubborn baron seizes the strategically important Rochester Castle with a handful of men and vows to hold it until French forces arrive to break the back of King John's army. Sounds good, right?

Helping the solid premise along is a cast including such heavy hitters as James Purefoy (HBO's Rome), Brian Cox (Troy's Agamemnon), and Paul Giamatti (HBO's John Adams). With a cast like that you just know the acting is going to be great, and in this regard Ironclad does not disappoint. James Purefoy is particularly good as the morose Templar Knight Thomas Marshal, a man who has seen too much bloodshed and desires to leave his Templar Order for good. And, needless to say, the always excellent Paul Giamatti is no disappointment here either and quickly steals the show as the enraged King John. Brian Cox rounds out the key characters with his typically bombastic performance as the rebelling Barron Albany, the fly in King John's ointment.

With only the briefest of introductions, the movie breathlessly careens into the siege of Rochester, where Marshal and Baron Albany enlist the aid of the castle's small compliment of rank and file defenders, along with a medieval dirty dozen - well, really just a half dozen - made up of a motley bunch of mercenaries, including such tired stereotypes as a good natured wildman, an uncontrollable letch, a stone-cold killer...yawn. It isn't long before the perpetually annoyed King John arrives and begins laying siege to the castle.

What follows is bloody mayhem as the defenders desperately repel one attack after another with abundant carnage (with a subtitle of `Blood. Will. Run.', who would have thunk it, right?). Leading every fight is Purefoy's Templar killing machine who mows down every opponent with the unstoppable fury of a medieval Terminator. As someone who has become increasingly frustrated by Hollywood's insistence on ridiculously extravagant ninja swordplay, it was nice to see the same treatment finally lavished on a medieval knight. Purefoy's character flashes into battle with a great sword that literally hacks opponents in twain, and who moves with such grace that it all makes for a fascinating ballet of death. What is more, it serves to make Marshal's background as an elite Templar crusader all the more believable. This aspect alone had the potential to make this movie a refreshing take on the often staid presentation of medieval warfare that usually involves unimaginative swordplay. I thank Ironclad for finally giving the medieval knight his fare share of martial prowess.

Ironclad also helps shatter the oft all too clean presentation of medieval warfare by splashing around buckets of gore (again, that `Blood. Will. Run.' hint). Limbs are chopped off (and then used to beat another over the head...seriously!), heads are smashed, torsos cleaved in two...it is truly grisly gore right out of a horror movie. In fact, I got the distinct impression that director Jonathan English was watching Kill Bill Vol. 1 one night and said, ""Hey, let's make the same type of bloody movie, but set in a Braveheart-like setting!"" Ironclad even goes for a Kill Bill spaghetti western presentation in more than one scene.

Unfortunately, there are two flaws in this film that I felt really dragged down would should have been an otherwise solid war film; flaws that are becoming so prevalent with this genre that I am starting to really, really sicken of it.

The first flaw is - you guessed it - the ahistorical nonsense that fills this film, from King John's use of pagan Danish mercenaries (who are led by Vladimir Kulich, reprising his Viking role from The Thirteenth Warrior), to...well, I can't tell you about the real end of the siege of Rochester versus what happens here. These major inaccuracies really bug me and here's why: while it is common knowledge that many history films are littered with such ahistorical nonsense, I have found that medieval films in particular are wildly inaccurate to an extent that I find downright disrespectful to the period. Be it El Cid, Braveheart, or now Ironclad, they all take an actual historical event or person as its starting point, and proceed to so twist it that it actually disfigures the actual history to the point that it is almost unrecognizable. And don't give me that lame excuse often uttered by lazy scriptwriters and directors about how it is impossible to make a historically accurate film and still keep it entertaining. That is bunk, and I am sorry to see the public parroting such a specious line of reasoning. Truth is: real history is just as entertaining - and I believe more so - as the fabricated and banal faux history coming out of Hollywood, especially when it comes from this thoroughly fascinating era of European history. No, what is going on here is a combination of laziness and sheer historical indifference, and I, for one, am just sick of it. If you're going to make a history film, bloody well make a history film, or just dispense with the whole ""based on actual events"" nonsense!

My second big flaw concerns the central character of Thomas Marshal, the Templar knight. Before I even saw the movie, I knew exactly how Marshal was going to be portrayed: as a disillusioned crusader who begins to question his faith. Well, not five minutes in and we're introduced to Thomas Marshal: a disillusioned crusader who begins to question his faith. Sigh. This is such a trite idea that it has not only been used by earlier films, but also by video games (when your plot resembles something found in a video game, you're going down the wrong path). It is also particularly silly. What I mean by that is this: Marshal is supposed to be part of the elite of the elite, a crusading Templar dedicated to holy warfare, right? So what are we to believe, that Marshal went through years of rigorous and sophisticated training (btw: the Templars excelled at training for war during this period, all without relying on Roman material no less), only to be shocked by the violence of it all? Somebody really thought this was a believable plot line? Truth is, this is less a reflection of the attitude of professional soldiers - then and now - and more about the modern entertainment industry's inability to accept the idea that tough wars are often fought by men much tougher than those found inside a movie studio. Not everyone is a navel-gazing crybaby, guys.

But it gets even more predictable. Shortly after Marshal gets to Rochester castle, we discover that the castle's elderly Lord Cornhill (Derek Jacobi) is locked in a loveless marriage with the ravishing Lady Isabel (played by Kate Mora). Again...here we go with a trite theme so obvious that I suspect everyone but the dimmest of the dim saw what was to come: that Isabel would fall head over heels in love with the manly but chaste Marshal, forcing him to betray his vows or lose the love of Isabel. And that is exactly what happens, and with little rhyme or reason other than someone clearly decided that there MUST be a love interest in this movie no matter how superficial or ham-handed it would seem. And while it is true that we do get to see Marshal initially resist the temptress, eventually he just gives in to Isabel's endless anti-clerical sermonizing (pun) about how the Templars have twisted his manhood and robbed him of happiness. Marshal does initially defend his order, reminding the fatuous Isabel that but for the training the Templars have given him, she and all in Rochester Castle would already be dead, but that bit of logic never penetrates her thick skull. But here is where it gets so bizarre that I almost chocked on my popcorn: after urging Marshal to break his vows, to turn his back on his order, and even more incredibly, engage in adultery, Isabel self-righteously states ""I am not sin"" when Marshal still has some reservations. Seriously? I mean, if she isn't the living embodiment of sin, no one is! It is simply incredible that neither the screenwriters, nor the director or the actors, had the wit (moral compass?) to realize the incredible hypocrisy in her statement. A woman urges a man to turn his back on every vow he has ever made, yet we are to see her as some sort of champion of purity and wisdom? Really?!? It reminds me of the incredible moral blindness seen in Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven, where Balian murders a priest, leads three dutiful lawmen to their death, flees to a foreign land and promptly has an affair with the wife of his host, and yet is still proclaimed the righteous hero. Unfortunately, we have the same immorality championed here (we live in scary times, people).

I found Isabel's incredible statement to be so idiotic, that I figured the movie had a card up its sleeve; that Isabel was a metaphor, an Eve to Marshal's Adam, and that after tempting him into sin, Marshal would either meet a tragic end (even if he won the battle, he would still lose the war, so to speak), or he would rediscover his faith, move on from Isabel and return to the Templars, all the better for having faced his doubts. Nope. That would be too original, I suppose.

In the end, it is just plain idiocy in the script. Like my earlier comment about how the entertainment biz sees every soldier as a self-doubting wimp, this is an example of how every modern movie sees religion and faith as foolish nonsense that is best dispensed with via some cleansing hedonism. Again, I am sick of this threadbare post-modernist nonsense that appears in every medieval film. Hey guys: if you don't like the Catholic morality of the Middle Ages, then spare us your medieval films because all you ever accomplish is to butcher the period's history, and engage in some tedious, anti-religious blackface theatre. And, quite frankly, it is so tiring at this point that it is not even offensive, just really, really amateurish in the fashion of the old ""the butler did it"" saw. Could we at least get some fresh bigotry? Or, if you're feeling adventurous, perhaps we could actually get a movie where the main character is exactly what he appears to be? You know, authenticity? That would seem to be more realistic, and less cynical, too. But I guess that would be too daring for any filmmaker these days.

BTW: In light of the above, consider this: there is a scene in the film where we get to see Giamatti's King John take some very bloody revenge on the rebels. Afterwards, a blood spattered John makes a very impassioned speech about the necessity of brutality in keeping order. Sympathy for the devil? Certainly seems so. Is immorality the theme of Ironclad? You decide.

As it stands, Ironclad is a blood-filled medieval-themed action film that takes it cues from the like of Kill Bill Vol. 1. With that in mind, I suspect once it hits Spike TV, or whatever your local trash TV network happens to be, it is going to quickly develop a cult following...and not without good reason. Honestly, it is a fun hack and slash war film. Unfortunately, it could have been so much more. By resorting to historical inaccuracies for no good reason, and by indulging in anachronistic anti-religiosity, the movie needlessly stumbles into addle-brained mediocrity. Shame, because its better points otherwise might have carried this film into a loftier status. Still, all things considered, it is a sufferable film that should please anyone who liked The Thirteenth Warrior, Kill Bill or similar fare. Give it a try but keep your expectations spaghetti western low. If you do that, you might just enjoy it.",1330387200,4,11722,4.811910669975186
4491530,2,B004X1Z14C,"I get why people like this movie-given the budget the action when it occurs has a well done realistic POV grittiness-something rarely seen in movies anymore. I also understand why people dislike it-this movie is obviously is not a documentary and it may be offensive to Danish history.  However, I dislike this film for another reason: the dire direction, the lack of editing and the poor pacing.
This movie is 2 hours but there is 19 minutes collectively of action at the start and 16 minutes towards the end. It would be generous to say there is an additional 25 minutes of screen time that advance the plot, enhance the characters and make the story somewhat interesting. Where the poor directing and pacing comes in is during the 60 minutes of this movie where nothing happens. At the simplest explanation: the good guys of 20 or so men sit in the castle while waiting for the 1,000 bad guys to attack again. Why the bad guys are waiting when it is obvious another 2 or 3 attacks will win the keep is never explained. To sum up how boring the middle of the movie is there is a scene where the good guys are starving while fortified in the castle during the course of the winter months. The bad guys are feasting away merrily every night in front of the castle. The Templar decides to steal their food on a solo stealth mission. For 20 minutes nothing exciting or plot propelling has happened on screen so you would think we are due for some action or intrigue. Nope. Instead we only see 3 bad guys chasing the Templar from a safe distance back into the castle after he steals two sacks of food. Next scene we are back to doing nothing plus now everyone is eating and being merry.
What really pissed me off is that this movie is advertised as a Dark Ages version of Magnificent Seven or 13 Samurai. It is not. There is just the one Templar Knight who is too introspective to be relatable on any level above slinging a sword around. The merrymen that accompany him are thinly drawn characters; honorable thieves and ready to brawl bar men who commit their lives, fight clumsily, but don't promote any of the warrior's philosophy that made the 13 Samurai so good. Even 300 had a clear battlefield  philosophy which was exemplified thru the character's interactions and circumstances. Here we see our good guys sitting around doing nothing for most of the movie. There is a super silly scene around the 80 minute mark where our supposedly skillful Templar mounts his horse and blindly charges a cluster of armed men in a very tight space. The horse is bombarded and the Templar clumsily falls to the ground at the feet of the arm men who are about to gore the hell out of him. Before that happens the horse regains its balance magically finds space to escape and drags our not so graceful hero to safety. The sheer absurdity of this made me want to press the DVD eject button but regretfully I was committed to seeing this joke of a movie to the end. In all earnest, stronger direction and not more money would have made this movie an instant classic like Braveheart was.",1330128000,2,3071,4.511669658886894
4491531,3,B004X1Z14C,"England, 1215. Facing rebellion and insurrection, King John signs a formal document outlining the limits of his royal power, the Magna Carta. Within months he has repudiated the document and brought in an army of Danish mercenaries to isolate and destroy the nobles who forced him to sign it, one-by-one. Thomas Marshall, a Knight Templar, and Baron d'Aubigny vow to oppose the invasion and take control of Rochester Castle, the gateway out of southern England. John must take the castle or risk his lines of supply being cut off behind him. So begins a furious siege, with twenty defenders holding out against an attacking army of a thousand with little hope of relief.

Ironclad is a medieval war film, depicting King John's Siege of Rochester in 1215 during the First Barons' War. This siege was notable as John personally commanded the siege and prosecuted the siege with unusual vigour. Unable to simply wait the garrison out, he undertook to take the castle by storm. He employed a full battery of medieval tactics to take the castle, including scaling ladders, siege engines, mines and even burning pigs (used to help breach the keep from underneath). It was a brutal, ugly siege which Ironclad depicts reasonably convincingly.

The film stars the ever-reliable James Purefoy (notable for his stunning turn as the verbose and debauched Mark Antony from the HBO series Rome), cast against type as the quiet, intense and conflicted Marshall, very loosely based on a real historical figure of the same name. Marshall is a Knight Templar who no longer feels he is worthy to be a member of the order, and is tortured by his feelings for women and his inability to keep his vow of silence. He pretty much spends the whole film exchanging scenes of angst with scenes of slaughtering hordes of attacking conscripts (and occasional Danish mercenaries). This structure risks cheese - and a distinct aroma of Stilton starts to rise during the painfully cliched will they-won't they romantic scenes with the lord's sexually-frustrated wife, Lady Isabel (played with enthusiasm but little subtlety by Kate Mara) - but Purefoy's notable screen presence just about manages to keep things ticking along.

The rest of the cast is surprisingly distinguished. Brian Cox is in his element as the old warhorse assembling a team of scoundrels and criminals to defend the castle, whilst Derek Jacobi plays the lord of Rochester Castle who is upset by his peaceful fortress being turned into a warzone. Charles Dance has a sterling turn as Archbishop Langdon, whilst Jason Flemyng gives a solid performance as Becket, the most dubious of the castle defenders. Outshining everyone else, however, is Paul Giamatti who gives a passionate performance as King John. The utter rage John feels at having been forced to limit the powers of the throne (the beginning of a movement which will ultimately lead to the English Civil War, four and a half centuries later) is palpable, and his increasing desperation to burn all trace of Magna Carta to ashes before he is militarily defeated is well-played.

From a production standpoint, the film has to face the challenge of depicting a fairly brutal and savage siege on a relatively limited budget. Director Jonathan English makes the most of his resources, however, creating a superb set for the siege itself. It can be seen where costs were cut during the battle sequences (most notably the use of slightly fake-looking CGI for the flaming siege weapons), but overall the film manages to sell the illusion it is trying to create.

From the viewpoint of historical accuracy, the film takes a fair number of liberties. The number of defenders of the castle was much higher in reality (between 100 and 150) and, although John did succeed in reducing the castle to a ruin, he ultimately failed to take the castle by assault and had to starve the last defenders out. He also didn't massacre the surviving garrison, having been persuaded that to do so would risk reprisals if he was captured in the battles to come. Most notably, the film depicts the defenders holding out hopes for an imminent French intervention, where in reality the French did not dispatch troops until many months later. Arguably the real events could have been used to tell a more interesting and dramatic cinematic story, but the budget and time restrictions of the movie did not allow this.

Ironclad (***) is therefore a movie which has a lot of problems. The romance is shoehorned unconvincingly into the narrative and Kate Mara's character is given little to do outside of it. The film also takes more liberties with historical accuracy than some may feel comfortable with. Against that most of the performances are extremely strong (Giamatti in particular) and the battle sequences are well-staged. Ultimately it entertains, if you can overcome the urge to wince at its failings. The movie is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1329696000,,4951,4.973429951690822
4491532,3,B004X1Z14C,"This is a very focused tale dealing with English Medieval History in regards to the siege of Rochester Castle. King John who was probably better known as brother to Richard the Lionheart and son to Eleanor of Aquitaine is struggling to hold his kingdom together against barons desiring more rights, being denied such and then going to war. Part of these events all led to the Magna Carta of 1215 though it's mostly inaccurate to compare it to the rights of all individuals (as done in the film) as it was basically designed to increase the rights of the lesser nobility. There's lots of gore and grittiness to this picture but somewhere along the makings of this film money promised was not given and you can see that it suffers in certain parts. James Purefoy (best known as Mark Antony in HBO's ROME) plays a cynical Templar Knight who ends up helping at the defense of the castle with some of his other allies. The additional cast was impressive but underutilized: Paul Giamatti (as King John), Derek Jacobi and Kate Mara. Historical inaccuracies (too many to list and I suspect most viewers don't care because who cares about History, right?) bring the grade down for me some but it was still a fun, gritty film. People with weak stomachs will need to turn away during certain scenes. As I said above partly in the defense of this film it's funding fell apart during the making. I suspect there was executive producer conflict as well as 18 people got credits as executive producers. Anyway, the budget for this was $25M and Worldwide Box Office was a disappointing $2.5M.

4491533,4,B004X1Z14C,"I am drawn to movies dealing with Medieval England. It is always brought home to me, however, by every viewing of such a movie, how infinitely more enjoyable present-day life is, with its abundance of indoor plumbing, central heating, and soap - not to mention the relative absence of thugs ready and able to snuff you like a candle.

""Ironclad"" tells the largely-imaginative story of the seizure and siege of Rochester Castle in Kent, England, during the rule of King John. The nobles of England had enforced King John, under extreme duress, to sign the Magna Carta, one of the first Bill of Rights of sorts; John had been running roughshod over England doing pretty much as he pleased, and England as a whole had had just about enough of it. John was allowed to remain as king, as long as he signed the Magna Carta. He took his revenge afterward by systematically doing in many of the men who made him sign it. The Holy Roman Catholic Church, always heavily involved with royal rule, either unaware or turning a blind eye to John's inhumane goings-on in England, sided with the Crown over the uproar he was causing, and things were coming to a head when it was decided by the barons to take control of Rochester Castle - a major military strategic site - to baffle John's access to London.

From that basic historical truth, ""Ironclad"" takes over, putting the occupation of Rochester Castle in the charge of an unhappy Knights Templar soldier, who has seen too much of war but who is suited to little else, and a ragtag collection of mercenaries under the control of William d'Aubigny, the baron who seemed most put out by King John's excesses. The knight, played with pained virtue by James Purefoy, does an exemplary job of knocking off scores of the King's men single-handedly, backed up by about a dozen others, against King John's thousand-or-so (the reality was considerably more than a dozen defenders, but still far short of the royal attackers). D'Aubigny is played with bluster and courage by Brian Cox; he is attended by his loyal squire, Guy (Aneurin Barnard). One face fairly recognizable to Americans will be the bowman named Marks, played by Mackenzie Crook (the eyeball guy in Pirates of the Caribbean), who is well-known as a comedian in England but who plays a pretty competent archer in this movie. The name that drew me to watching the movie is Paul Giamatti, the despot King John (or is it pisspot? He does an admirable imitation of one here), who chews the scenery enjoyably, has tantrums, delivers a long I'm-the-boss-here-and-don't-you-forget-it speech when challenged, and generally behaves badly, to great effect. Also always a welcome addition to anything he does is Derek Jacobi, as Cornhill, the keeper of Rochester Castle. Thrown into the mix is Cornhill's ignored, young, and beautiful wife (Kate Mara), tired of virginity and casting an appraising eye on the self-tortured Knights Templar.

There are gallons of blood. There are many chopped-off extremities. Did I say, in another review, that 'Spartacus' was bloody? 'Spartacus' was a preface to the gore spewed about in ""Ironclad"". They also do a pretty good job of decimating a lovely castle - but it's all in the name of cinema, after all. The real castle was destroyed and rebuilt several times.

The real, true history is not exactly what is rendered here, although the general template is used. If you want the truth, there are plenty of accounts. There was a King John, and he was a pain in the butt (he is the reason that there is some rule - or so I've read - that no future king of England may be named John); many of the others represented here did actually exist. You can't watch this movie to pass a test in English history, but it did absorb me for the time allotted, and reinforced my affection for 2012. Glad I'm here and not there. Watch it for the story.

4491535,5,B004X1Z14C,"I just watched this movie for the first time last night and I must say I am greatly impressed! Though I am unable to speak to the historical accuracy of this film. I can tell you it was executed with gritty realism that we just don't see very often these days.

The story is the retelling of the signing of the Magna Carta by King John and the brave few who opposed him from Rochester Castle. John is not a good man, as you find out from the narrative at the beginning of the film. So his people unite under his nobles and strip him of most of his power. Predictably this does not last as he raises an army of Danish mercenaries with the blessing of the pope to reclaim his lands and kill those who opposed him.

Though this plot seems fairly tried and done. I can tell you with the fantastic cast assembled to see it through it shines well above your expectations. The battle scenes are well done for the budget. Their is some doggy camera work but the end result is satisfying. Like I said before their is a grittiness to this film. The people and environments look dirty and worn and fit perfectly with the story.

James Purefoy and Paul Giamatti sell their roles with colorful enthusiasm and it shows in great ways. All the characters have a sincere quality about them and only a few are not three dimensional and fleshed out as well as I thought they could have been. Giamatti, I must say, is awesome as the villain. He is evil in ways that sends shivers down your spine. And Mr. Purefory, well done sir! He epitomizes the ideals of knight hood and service perfectly not to mention he looks like an authentic swordsman.

With most movies selling sex and special effects it is hard to find one with story and deep characters which one sympathizes with and feels for. Iron clad is a marvelous period piece, which is both believable and entertaining. I say bravo!",1323820800,3,1865,4.397101449275362
4491536,4,B004X1Z14C,"A bravura performance by all concerned, particularly Paul Giammati and James Purefoy. While it is probably not historically accurate, one doesn't watch a movie like this for historical accuracy. Very realistic fight scenes - warning: the scene with the pigs is difficult to watch! However, the sword work, siege weapons,  mines, and dirt, cold, dankness of the life and times of medieval persons is probably pretty accurate. I have a hard time with the female lead's costumes - way too much skin and her hair isn't covered, but other than that it seems that the costumes, weapons, and tactics are pretty accurate.

I'm no expert in movies these days, but I can honestly say that Ironclad was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It had a great story and really good acting by everyone in it.

I was really impressed with the actor that played King John. He was top notch in his performance. I was really impressed with this movie and I think everyone should see it. You won't be disappointed!

4491539,4,B004X1Z14C,"Others have written reviews telling most of this film's plot so I'll not retype what's already been said.  I will say I was very surprised by the higher-than-expected production quality of this movie given that it was obviously not a mega-budget epic.  This is not ""Kingdom of Heaven"" but it does a superb job of looking like a ""big"" medieval movie.  The acting is very good, the story line is predictable but good as well, and the costuming and historical authenticity, as far as wardrobe and weapondry is concerned, is fantastic.  Yes, the Templar does use FAR too large of a sword in some of the fighting scenes, but aside from that, I really didn't see any glaring inaccuracies as far as weapondry and wardrobe were concerned.

Typically, yes, the fair maiden is busty and I am aware that ladies didn't run around with their heads uncovered back then, but, movies for some reason, haven't decided to have all the ""respectible"" ladies wearing head coverings because that's just not what movie goers want to see.  It also does amuse me, since I do medieval reenacting as well, how snug the chain mail is (especially on the arms) in all medieval movies, the speed at which characters can get in and out of it, and how effortlessly it seems to be worn - but, that's something you have to experience before you appreciate the historical accuracy of it.  If chain mail sleeves fit as tightly as they do in this movie (and every other movie I think I've ever seen), no one could ever get into, or out of, their mail.

All that aside, it's a very good flick about a subject that should be better known.  Yes, it is gory as everyone has stated.  In fact, this is probably THE single most gory medieval warfare movie I've ever watched, but, that's the way it was back then.  On the gore-fest subject, however, what you will see here is no worse than anything shown weekly on ""The Walking Dead"" and nobody seems to have a problem with that.  Overall, I highly recommend this one.  Would've given it five stars if it had employed a few more extras for the battle scenes assaulting the castle; that's my only real ""beef"" with the movie.  When William attacked Rochester, I'm certain his army looked a lot more intimidating in numbers than the movie portrays, but, this is a minor point.  If you like medieval history, if you liked ""Kingdom of Heaven"" or ""Pillars of the Earth"" or ""Centurian"" this movie will not disappoint.",1321488000,4,2414,4.594405594405594
4491540,3,B004X1Z14C,"Ironclad is not about warships, or tanks, but rather the original ironclads: armored knights.  Specifically, Templars.  It's also a history lesson gussied up as a grim tale reminiscent of the Magnificent Seven.

King John (Paul Giamatti) has signed the Magna Carta, giving the dukes freedom to govern themselves while at the same time keeping the king's lineage intact.  John and the Pope change their minds as soon as the rebellion is over, and soon the King returns with a Danish army to reclaim the throne.

The bishops and dukes who support the Magna Carta have all gone home.  It will take weeks to rouse them, and help from the sympathetic French monarchy is months away. As John closes his stranglehold on England, a key castle in his supply line, Rochester, is all that stands in his way.

Enter our Templar, Thomas Marshal (a muted James Purefoy).  Sworn to a vow of silence for reasons known only to him, Marshal is to be released from service by a kindly priest.  When John crosses the priest and his Templar brothers, the memory of their betrayal as part of the rebellion still burning fresh, he decides to teach them a lesson by cutting out the priest's tongue.  Violence ensues, Marshal escapes, and soon he is leading a charge of desperate men to take and hold Rochester from John's mercenaries long enough for the French auxiliaries to arrive.

Ironclad is one of those films that equates brutal violence and dirt with gritty realism, but only when it suits the story.  Isabel (Kate Mara), the lady of Rochester, becomes quite taken with Marshal, for reasons that are never fully explained other than that she's looking for a roll in the medieval hay.  Many a longing glance is exchanged, but the film drags and drags before the two finally get it on - and then the camera pans away.

But it doesn't pan away from all sorts of cartoonish levels of violence, from clavicles split to a man being beaten with his own arm.  Torture is on graphic display, interspersed occasionally by a narrator sharing some facts about history.  Somehow I don't think history included a lady wearing a sleeveless studded-leather dress with unblemished features and always silky (clean!) long hair.

The Danes are led by Tiberius, a gigantic Viking of a man (Vladimir Kulich, who was last seen in the 13th Warrior).  Kulich's physical presence is unmistakable, and he plays essentially the same role here - a weary warrior fighting to save his homeland.  The film reserves no sympathy for Tiberius, however - once he steps on screen we know he's there to fight the Marshal in one-on-one combat to the death.

The siege of the castle ranges from thrilling to mind-numbingly boring. Although CGI is occasionally used for long shots, it's clear the movie was filmed on location.  The castle is as much a character as the actors.

Since Marshal barely speaks most of the time (he thankfully breaks his vow of silence early on), it's up to wide-eyed Frodo-esque squire Guy (Aneurin Barnard) to act as the audience's proxy.  Much is made of the horrors of war and Guy's transformation into a warrior.  Unfortunately that's all there is to him. Despite Guy's good looks, he doesn't have much to do.

The centerpiece of Ironclad is King John.  Giamatti clearly took the role for a magnificent rant in which he chews the scenery, pacing and spitting, as he gloats over his enemies and defends the nature of the monarchy.  It's worth the price of admission.

Ironclad could easily have a half hour cut from its two hour running time.  It teaches some important lessons about history, but despite its over-the-top gore, it's unlikely the audience will pay attention long enough to learn anything.",1320624000,2,3680,4.8060413354531
4491541,5,B004X1Z14C,"Writer, Producer, Director Jonathan English has unleashed an incredibly gritty balls to the wall reenactment of the battle of Rochester Castle in 13th Century England and utilizes its terrain and turrets in Kent as its backdrop. Lensed almost entirely in Wales, 'IRONCLAD' is another grand scale epic made overseas and without the CGI hi-jinks of big budget Hollywood no-brainers.  The film will be remembered for its battle scenes but its the brilliant performances by its main actors that makes this film outshine its predecessors. It includes James Purefoy who was an excellent Marc Anthony in the HBO miniseries 'ROME' shining as Thomas, a Templer Knight torn between his allegiances; Kate Mara ,the other woman in AMC's hit series 'AMERICAN HORROR STORY' is emerging as an incredible actress in her own right and excels as a frustrated young wife of an older Baron from an arranged marriage; the always reliable Brian Cox; the venerable Derek Jacobi; and a shattering performance by Paul Giamatti as King John which should give him another notch on his belt of memorable characters.  Although the film tends to sag in the middle, its the superb photography by David Eggby and snap-crackle-pop editing by Peter Amundson which will rattle your cranium.  Add a wonderfully symphonic Celtic score by composer Lorne Balfe and you have a bloody good time for all lovers of Epics and films of honor.  Arcentertainment presents it in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen transfer with 5.1 Dolby Stereo with an audio commentary by Jonathan English and theatrical trailer for the film as its only special features.

4491542,4,B004X1Z14C,"Whenever a film purports to chronicle a historical event (i.e. the First Barons' War in England, which began with the siege of Rochester Castle in the year 1215), and then spends approximately the first 40 seconds giving you the historical background before plunging the viewer pretty much straight into medieval-era dangers and derring-do.... at times like these, it is best to tell yourself, ""It is what it is,"" and just sit back, relax, smile, and watch the blood and severed limbs fly.

Because you're not gonna get the formal, historical, Oxford lecture series retelling of events, my friends. No, not even if you necromantically raise the desiccated corpse of Alexander Scourby in your living room and command his cadaver to read aloud John Milton's `The History of Britain"" throughout the entirety of ""Ironclad."" You're still not gonna get it...

The story: Grim, war-weary Knight Templar Sir Thomas Marshall (James Purefoy, an actor who snags the ""Robert E. Howard"" character roles as quickly as they're written) returns from the Crusades and joins forces with Baron Albany (Brian Cox, that incomparable paragon of stagecraft), who seeks to rebel against the despotic King John (Paul Giamatti, that incomparable paragon of shouting). Together, they take control of Rochester Castle because they know its strategic location will be a decisive factor in the coming civil war. Aided by a half dozen or so of Albany's comrades - all of whom make the ""hardest of the hard"" from ""Braveheart"" look like wimps - plus a few soldiers from the castle garrison, Sir Thomas heroically defends Rochester Castle against King John's army of barbaric Danish mercenaries. Note: Did the filmmakers want to include an exotic, Viking element in their retelling just for the fun of it? That was my first clue to throw 'historical accuracy' to the four winds for this one.

It's true that, taken as a historical drama, ""Ironclad"" doesn't offer much. Taken as a ""European"" martial arts film, however, it merits one's attention.

The bottom line: I've not seen another film in this genre (except for ""Braveheart"") that takes an array of Europe's deadliest medieval weapons and demonstrates to the viewers - graphically - exactly why those weapons were so effective in battle. To give one example, Purefoy's Knight Templar character fights using a two-handed longsword, and at times he grasps the blade to shift and swing the weapon, or reverses his grip entirely and attacks his foes with the hilt and weighted pommel. This is a real swordfighting technique, now almost forgotten, because nowadays everyone is accustomed to thinking of the hilt of the sword as ""the place to put your hands.""  What this technique accomplishes is to turn a (presumably) slow, heavy longsword into a body-length bladed staff, with a heavy, battering weight at one end. And if you think that's cool, watch what the character named Becket (Jason Flemyng) does with the pole-axe/halberd he wields throughout most of the film.

Plus, there are destructive siege engines. And monstrous Viking battle-axes. And throwing knives. Clubs studded with iron rivets, anyone? Right here. Severed limb, anyone? Oh, you betcha, says Ms. Palin.

So, if you should decide to watch ""Ironclad,"" watch it for these reasons. All of the fights look cool and feel real, and overall, the performances are generally as they should be for this type of film. Not much depth of character, in other words, but who really cares when it's mano-a-mano, and steel is crashing against sanguine steel (or thudding into flesh). Ol' Robert Ervin Howard would approve. If you truly want to experience ""the real Middle Ages in Britain"" then go take in a Latin High Mass at Mel Gibson's dad's church, or something, and then drink until you want to fight everyone around you. And besides, who expects bona fide historical accuracy from a hack-and-slash, cheer the heroes movie that casts Paul ""We couldn't afford Gary Oldman"" Giamatti in the role of England's most infamous monarch?",1319500800,14,4004,5.075987841945289

If you want bloody savage Medieval combat, with all the grusome gore that swords, axes, and maces can dish out, ...here it is! The battle scenes are quite graphic, with plenty of shattered skulls, splattered brains, crushed bones, and spraying of blood. And thats what REAL close-quarters fighting with melee weapons was!

In the true historical event, there were far more fighting men defending Rochester. An estimated 190 knights held the walls, with all their sargeants and men-at-arms. Naturally, King John would need an even larger army to besiege the castle. At the time, it was considered the largest siege-operation ever carried out in England.

4491545,2,B004X1Z14C,"Now I do not want to seem too negative, but this film has so much promise but delivered so little.

I love historical hack n slash movies, but this film was nothing but cardboard characters who were playing their stereotyped roles to the hilt.

The dialogue was suspect in a few places but what really let me down was the idea behind the romantic attraction for a young attractive woman's feelings towards an average guy with no social skills, no sex appeal, no romance and no mystique was laughable - and all the way through the film I just wanted them to hump to get it out the way.

It was very much by-the-numbers screen writing and directing, and the fact that it had some well known actors and was by the same studio that did 300 made it all the more irksome.

I had no idea why the Danes came into it, when historically they didn't.

I have no idea why 1,000 men with war machines for months were unable to storm a keep defended by so few, but of course the reason for this is that historically they didn't even try but instead starved them out. The odds for a typical siege were between 2:1 and 4:1, so 50:1 is so absurd that at that point I wanted to switch off and find something more credible.

Overall it was a below average film, mainly because it had the potential to be so much more but it seemed to miss everything that it needed to become a block buster.",1318896000,2,1371,4.253846153846154
4491546,4,B004X1Z14C,I really enjoyed this film! I've waited a long time for a flick that covered a seige in the Middle Ages with any real action. This film well portrayed the true nature of defending a castle. The ability of a few defenders to throw off the attempts by a much larger force was well portrayed. I think every method of beseiging a fortress was demonstated including the starvation method. Well done!,1318809600,,394,4.563380281690141

Let's make the stern Templar an unstoppable killing machine - until he has sex with the uncommonly-clean woman with too much skin showing for the time and then he fails"". (Sampson, anyone?). Burning pigs alive instead of using the rendered oil was just inane. Nice try at historically-accurate costuming and props, but Marshall's sword was a good century off. (I do give kudos for the early falchion, though.) There were no Danish mercenaries involved with the real thing...and the guys in the film weren't even speaking Danish! King John promising the Danish captain the Pope would not Christianize his country, when this had been accomplished already for about 200 years...please.

I really wanted to like this one, but it just didn't cut it.  It makes me quite sad that our cousins overseas have been infected with the Hollywood bug.

Background: at Runnymede, a coalition of barons forced John to sign the Magna Carta, a document that assured certain rights to free men, including protection against arbitrary punishments of the king.

According to this highly fictionalized work by writer/director Jonathan English, King John immediately reneged on the Magna Carta's coerced promises. His campaign to retake control of southeast England, with the Pope's blessing and an assist from Danish mercenaries, is disrupted by a handful of men led by a brave knight templar (James Purefoy) who rides a white horse. Their courageous stand at strategic Rochester Castle and keep delay John's advance long enough for help to arrive from France. The rebels were beseiged for months, outnumbered a hundred to one, and most of them perished after a number of battles. The survivors witnessed their liberators' arrival, the scattering of John's forces and his retreat from the field. This all makes for engaging cinema, but reality is quite different.

The rebels within Rochester numbered about 100, not thirteen. The baron leading the castle's defense, William d'Aubigny (who's played by Brian Cox and called ""Albany"" here), wasn't maimed and then brutlly killed. He in fact lived 20 more years and became a loyalist upon the accession of Henry III. Nearly dead from starvation, history says that Aubigny's garrison surrendered to John in November 1215, after a seven week seige. John's hired pagan troops (also incorrect) never fled the field, as depicted in this film. The castle wasn't his for long, however as the barons' new leader, Prince Louis of France, captured Rochester in 1216, but long after its defenders had been removed.

.
IRONCLAD suffers from clichd techniques of modern movie-making, including distorted and spastic camera work during battle sequences, plus an over-reliance on violence and digitally-enhanced gore. Here, broadsword blows split men asunder as if they were pats of warm butter. Wounds are extra-ghastly, yet those ""good guys"" sustaining them continue doing battle until they're skewered on sword blades like so many shish kebab nuggets.

Despite these limitations, and accepting an intentionally inaccurate script, I have to admit I enjoyed this picture, and that's what really matters in the end.",1317081600,,2787,5.977443609022556

The movie is rated ""R"" and I only saw one hooter that wasn't an owl. Other than that, the rating is for violence primarily, and a little bit of vulgar language.  The language is less vulgar than your Jr Hi School kid hears on a daily basis, and the gore isn't as severe as I'd hoped for since that is the biggest claim of the promoters of this film.  There is a realism to this film though, and you get a sense of the crude and harsh conditions that time period had - and what battle strategies desperate men plied against each other.  There are some brutal sequences of torture and dismembering in ""Ironclad,"" but the suggestive themes of sex and passion are left to the imagination.  If all the film wanted to do is show horror and gritty violence, then it should have dismemberment including sodomizing beheaded throats, and body parts used as phallic substitutes in unwilling participant's body orifices, as well as broadswords impaling from crotch to crown both male and female combatants.  There should be some pitchforks, lance through the eye out the back of the head type stuff, and some better attempts to portray rotting leprosy.  But ""Ironclad"" does the best they can, and still get by the censorship in America.  Otherwise, it would be deemed a foreign film only, and would cost three times as much, not to mention only play on a high tech DVD player meant for outside the U.S. and Canada based movies.  As far as American censorship goes, I suppose ""Ironclad"" is fairly decent for a medieval violent history chronicle allegedly based upon true events.

4491554,5,B004X1Z14C,"This is a British made historical battle-a-thon, It is set in the aftermath of the signing of the Magna Carta by King John. He was more or less forced to sign and as such, felt somewhat aggrieved, so in the true fashion of all absolute monarchs, he sets about killing (gruesomely) every bally person responsible, that is the Barons and their `Monk Knights', the legendary Knights Templar.

King John is found out by one of the returning Crusader Templars played by James Purefoy (Solomon Kane), he teams up with the Baron of Albany played by the ever good value Brian Cox. They realise that in order to stop King John they will need to hold the strategically important castle of Rochester. King John has enlisted the help of the Danes, with the promise that they will be allowed to carry on worshiping their Pagan Gods and not have the Pope stuff Christianity down their throats. I suspect a bit of gold may have been promised too. They then set about taking the castle, but Albany has rounded up a small band of killing machines that like nothing more than a big ruck. They include Mackenzie Crook making another change of direction from his more sombre roles as in `The Office'.

Rochester is owned by Derek Jacobi playing Cornhill, and he is married to Kate Mara (Isabel), she is somewhat neglected in the bed chamber department and soon finds herself drawn to the mysterious and pious Templar. You just know stuff is going to happen. Meanwhile the siege begins, with trebuchets', siege towers and scaling ladders, plus loads of Viking nutters.  They are ridiculously outnumbered but believe that help is on the way from France and so have to hold out.

This is a brilliant film, with blood and guts from the beginning and some excellent performances most notably from Paul Giamatti who plays King John, he was so good at being evil, I found myself swearing at him at one point (very juvenile). The fight scenes are frequent and gory and everyone is covered in filth and grime all the time, the way it would have been, no Hollywood airbrushing thank gawd.

There is some CGI, but it is all done very well, there is a little de rigueur examination of the ethics of faith and the Papacy, but nothing to take this off track from being a blood and gore filled action fest. At 116 minutes, you will feel it is a short film, but you will also feel satisfied, this should have got a much wider circulation and I am so glad I finally got round to seeing it - if you like historical action this is a must see for you.",1315612800,4,2511,4.522026431718062

4491556,4,B004X1Z14C,"""Ironclad"" was met with lukewarm reviews from the press upon it's release. I understand their criticisms but it didn't stop my enjoyment one iota.

Here's the scoop. In 1215 King John is forced to sign the Magna Carta. He's really upset about this and hires a bunch of Danish mercenaries to take over a strategically positioned castle so he can re-gain the country and treat everybody like crap once again. The problem lies in the fact that said castle is being held by a small band of disparate individuals led by a Knight Templar and they are going to put the monkey in the wrench. Will they hold the castle? Will the French arrive in time to save the day? Will the Templar break his vows and get his ashes hauled by the local damsel?

I liked this movie quite a bit. Is it true to history? Probably not, but it's a fun ride nonetheless. When it was originally released in theaters I had reservations about Paul Giamatti as King John. My reservations were unfounded. He's his usual great self and has one scene in particular that is astounding. The rest of the cast is easily as good. James Purefoy as the Templar hit all the right notes for my money. And check out these other names. Brian Cox, Derek Jacobi, Mackenzie Crook, Jason Flemyng, Charles Dance et al are just part of this fine (and expensive) ensemble.

This might be an Historical Epic but it's a guy flick through and through. The fight scenes are intense and there are more dismemberments and cleavings than in any ten other movies. Believe you me, this is one gory outing with buckets o' blood. Some objected to the hand held camera work during the battle scenes but it didn't bother me. It's an expensive movie with a really good ""look"" to it. The final couple of scenes were a bit too 'Hollywood', but by then the movie is over so..... who cares. The music score is great and I liked the script a lot. There are certain scenes, save for those pesky last couple, that were written as well as anything I've seen in any other movie.

For a historically documented event, there was a both good and bad interpretation.  Despite the historical errors (too few defenders, no town, no Cathedral, too long an implied seige, Templars, affairs, who won), there was also good historical detail.  The castle looked good, the castle keep mining, the 40 pigs, cutting off hands and feet, etc...  Anyway, the botton line is simple, if you like this period of history, and don't get hyper mad at dramatic license, then this is a GREAT movie.

4491558,4,B004X1Z14C,"I'm a bit of a sucker for Medieval period films: always excited by the prospect of seeing something that might hew a little closer to history while exploring the origin of some of today's more persistent cultural tropes; often disappointed by the repeated turns to violence and rather cartoonish proclamations. Ironclad lands somewhere in between by managing to find a few moments which straddle these extremes.

Fellini had once made a very compelling point about the way in which we would view peoples and cultures of the distant past. While discussing ""Satyricon"" he pointed out that such peoples and cultures would seem very alien to contemporary perception: their behavior, beliefs and motivations becoming border-line incomprehensible to us. Ironclad does not come anywhere near such a portrayal of the Medieval mind, allowing itself instead to make a rather broad number of interpretations vastly more at home in the present day than would have been likely or even possible during the period in question. But even though the film exhibits many of the usual tendencies, it avoids the pronounced sense of romanticizing either the valor or violence surrounding the aftermath of the signing of the Magna Carta and gives a greater dimension to the ideas behind the events with an unexpected and beautifully executed apologia by one of its principal characters.

And that occurs in the performance Giamatti turns in as King John. In his display of profoundly brutal violence against his enemy -- here portrayed by Brian Cox -- and the breathtakingly belligerent tirade he delivers as his justification, this nearly pro-forma action flick momentarily becomes something that begins to provide us with a credible glimpse into the deep-seated societal conflicts of that time -- some still present today. As King John rails about the royalty's ideas centered on divine rights of inheritance while, in a brilliant directorial turn, seemingly standing on water, the lights begin to come on about how utterly ignorant, self-absorbed, cruel and narcissistic the god-chosen rulers of the Middle Ages could routinely be. Such rulers postponed modernity as long as possible by ignoring human rights while clinging to ideas that consistently stunted the well-being and progress of their citizens in favor of brutality, ignorance and suffering. And all in the name of their personal, greater glory.

Giamatti's walk on the water makes this vile worldview palpable and terrifying in a manner that no historical text can. Had Brian Cox been provided with a counter monologue as eloquent and moving in support of the rights of man -- something more substantial than merely repeating ""Magna Carta"" -- as Giamatti delivered in favor of suppression, birth right and the arrogance of privilege, Ironclad would have made a profoundly long leap forward for the genre, perhaps even becoming capable of a theoretical joust with Bresson's ""Lancelot du Lac"".",1314057600,7,2932,5.260683760683761
4491559,3,B004X1Z14C,"When it comes to medieval period pieces, it doesn't take much for them to get my attention, which is one reason I looked forward to Ironclad.  Featuring a great cast on paper with James Purefoy, Paul Giamatti, Charles Dance, Jason Flemyng, and Brian Cox among others; combined with the fact that the film was rumored to be a gorefest, this was something I looked forward to quite a bit.  Alas, Ironclad delivers on the gore and battle/action sequence departments in spades, but in terms of everything else it pretty much falls flat.  Brutal and tyrannical King John (Giamatti) goes against the recently formed Magna Carta and proceeds to wreck havoc upon the populace, eventually leading to Rochester Castle, as a rag-tag group consisting of a Knights Templar warrior (Purefoy) and others (Cox, Flemyng, and a few others) stands in his way.  In between all this are a handful of ultraviolent and ultra bloody battle scenes where limbs and heads often fly, as well as some excellent makeup effects to boot.  Other than that though, the fairly pedestrian script, inane dialogue with an equally inane love story sub-plot between Purefoy and Kate Mara's character, and stiff acting from practically everyone (save Giamatti who actually seems to be having a bit of fun with the material) really make Ironclad a disappointing endeavor.  Still, the battle scenes make it worth checking out at least if you have two hours to kill, but other than that there really isn't a whole lot here to make it all that worthwhile.",1313107200,,1510,4.901960784313726

4491562,4,B004X1Z14C,"Potent Small Scale 'Braveheart'

One of the better Medieval period-films I've seen. Accurate to the point of being disgusting and I'm more the pleased for it. Bloody, savage and brutal. No singing, no ridiculous troupes of dancing fools, no Renaissance Faires. This is what it was like: Gray, dingy and grim for a vast majority of people.

I'm always amazed at the folks who populate these reenactment camps - happily deceiving themselves by completely ignoring the truth. I want to see a Medieval Festival where urine and feces are randomly dropped onto people, to see streets of mud filled with the same. I want to know that the people there have no dental hygiene as we know it - not even a tooth brush. So how bad do you want to hug someone now? I want to smell insane amounts of perfume in an attempt to cover up rank body odor. I want to know the dry foodstuffs are infested with mites and grubs, and that the wet foods may or may not be rancid and/or infected with bacterial viruses. Clothes and bodies infested with fleas, skin covered in acne pustules, and a general brutality against the weak.

That's partly why I enjoyed 'Ironclad' - it didn't paint a rosy picture. <g>

The other reason: Ever since the cancellation of my much-lamented '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rome/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rome</a>', I've been hoping to see James Purefoy again. The guy is serious kick-ass. If there really were a comet-striking-the-earth-event, Purefoy is the dude I'd want to be around. I honestly see him clawing his way to the top of any primitive heap.

Particularly enjoyed the story, a good one for once, about the righteousness of the Knights Templar. They've taken a pretty mean beating in the media these past few years, character assassination seven-hundred years after they were betrayed and destroyed. To quote Wikipedia regarding the Chinon Parchments, ""It is currently the Catholic Church position that the medieval persecution of the Knights Templar was unjust; that there was nothing inherently wrong with the Order or its Rule; and that Pope Clement was pressured into his actions by the magnitude of the public scandal and the dominating influence of King Philip IV"".

So 'Ironclad' gives us a look at a true Templar. A holy knight of stout spirit and strong arm; a moral warrior with the clarity that comes from purity of vision. And I'm genuinely gratified to the filmmakers for this honest perspective. And, yes, I get the irony of this story sitting dead-center in the continual revisionist histories of King John.

The rest of the ragtag band of warriors reads like an all-star cast of every period film made in the last twenty-years: Brian Cox, Jayson Fleming, Mackenzie Crook, Jamie Foreman, John Pierce Jones, Derek Jacobi and the always enjoyable Charles Dance. Each were superlative in their deliveries; much appreciated and enjoyed.

Now to the weaker elements.

I honestly cannot see Paul Giamatti as anything other than a strong character actor, I can't, and I've really tried. I genuinely like the man. But productions like this proves, at least in my mind, that he's seriously overrated. It's great that a 'regular guy' like him gets to step up and play the big parts (President John Adams comes to mind) but he's just too dang goofy to be believable in so many types of roles. As sincere as his energetic performance was in 'Ironclad', he seemed diminutive in the performance. I enjoy his bad guy efforts so much more when they're fitted to him - not the other way around. If you get a chance to see '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shoot-Em-Up/dp/B000XA5K48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shoot 'Em Up</a>', you'll understand what I mean. As a medieval King Of England, he's just not suited.

One aspect to his character that I found intriguing: In the film, both introduction and curtain call for his character, has John standing and staring into shallow water. I wonder why? Reflective introspection?

And I still don't get how Kate Mara continually finds herself work. I have nothing against her personally, but she just doesn't connote a leading actress presence. Screened nearly a half-dozen productions with her as both lead and supporting actor - everything screams 'average'. Nothing pops, nothing sizzles. She's reminiscent of watching a kid sister in the school play.

Overall, an excellent film done on a small budget. Another $20 million and we would've gotten a larger, more authentic Rochester stage, fuller armies and a bigger splash. But I'm pleased with what they were able to achieve with what they had; filmmakers maximizing their resources is always appreciated.

[Edited Update 7.11.13]...

Despite being an actress of mediocre talent, I have since learned ""how"" Kate Mara has found herself in the middle of so many productions.

Explanation: Her daddy's a billionaire.

<smh> }:-(

If you're better than me at detective work, I suspect you will find any number of production companies that are actually fronts paid for and maintained by daddy.

4491563,4,B004X1Z14C,"This movie was poised to be something great before it went into production in 2009 - it had greater star power and a bigger budget - but many studios in Hollywood were suffering at the time and so this film eventually lost a lot of its backing. The one who stuck with it was actor James Purefoy, a seriously underrated actor known best for ""Resident Evil,"" ""A Knight's Tale,"" ""Solomon Kane,"" and ""Rome."" Most of the actors in this movie give their best, but moments of weak dialogue and story cliches prevent this film from becoming anything great. The director deserves the real credit for stretching a pretty narrow budget and making it look incredible on screen.

The film is fairly historically accurate in its retelling of the siege of Rochester Castle, a not very well known, but important, turning point in England's history - and the history of the free world. This movie begins right after the signing of the Magna Carta and focuses solely on the defense of Rochester Castle and how only a handful of men stood up against King John's army of thousands to eventually humiliate him.

SIDE NOTE: Violence. Holy schmoly! I'm a big fan of medieval films, but even I don't think there's another medieval movie of this stature that is this violent. Not only is it gruesome throughout, but the violence escalates - blood spurts, arms and heads being hacked and hacked until they come off, people being tortured, burned alive. It just doesn't stop in this movie! This is certainly not a film for the easily disturbed.

Overall, this is a pretty great flick. It's a strong, satisfying action film, and trust me when I say that you haven't seen anything until you've seen James Purefoy diffuse a hostage situation with a sword!",1312329600,,1725,4.724252491694352

The only flaw here is an incredibly wooden performance by the love interest, Kate Mara, who seems to have one expression (and I have seen her in other movies so I am not being unkind), while everyone else is acting their hearts out. As the Knight Templar, Purefoy sticks to his vows until he is finally worn down by that pesky Lady Isabel demanding sex - in the middle of a siege with food running out and hordes of Danish mercenaries baying for their blood - because she is married to an old crock (heroically played by Derek Jacobi), who owns the castle. The plot line is thinner than Lady Isabel's veil, the battle scenes are very good, albeit possibly this was a low budget movie. Paul Giamatti is a surprise choice to play the petulant King John who throws a tantrum whenever he can and displays a dreadful mean, low streak of cruelty. However, he acquits himself very well.
