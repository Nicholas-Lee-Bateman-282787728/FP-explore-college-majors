1957372,3,B0000W5J9K,"Notes From the Underground was a three-part story arc that ran during the first season of TMNT (and draws its name from a piece of classic literature about the human condition). When monsters show up on the sensors around their lair, the Turtles investigate and are drawn to an abandoned Foot genetics lab and a mysterious underground city. But something watches from the shadows...

Whats nice about the new Ninja Turtles show is that it has a sense of continuity. While this is a three-parter, it draws from plot points introduced back in episode four, and ends in a way that sets up the next few episodes in the series. The connection to the Foot clan connects this arc to the overall Shredder saga, and later stories in seasons 2 and 3 follow up and conclude the events depicted here. Serialization in children's programming is always appreciated.

My only complaint is that the pacing of the three-parter is slightly off, with part three feeling a bit rushed after the strong build up of the two parts before it. It's nothing remotely damaging, but still worth mentioning.

Overall, a decent saga and good entertainment. If you can stomach paying regular price for only three episodes (like most of Funi's regular discs), this is worth purchasing.",1122681600,4,1252,4.841121495327103
1957373,5,B0000W5J9K,"This is a gem.  I give this tape 5 stars - because I can't give it more.  An interesting, fun, and action-packed storyline from start to finish.  Each Turtle has a part to play, however, Michelangelo absolutely shines.  ""Notes From the Undergound"" is my favorite story arc, so far.  The animation is gorgeous, as usual.  The writers created an interesting story, along with some laugh out loud dialogue.  Kick back, and enjoy the ride.",1099267200,,435,4.797297297297297

1957507,3,B0000W5J9K,"I really LOVE the design of pizza box-set of season 5. It was super-ulator delicious idea. Different than what I am used to. The box-set design look like a pizza mix box inside the small pizza pen box filled with 3 pizza CD discs that has 3 different flavors of Pizza label on them. I have to tell you, You WILL LOVE the box design!!

Only two problems I do have with this design box-set.

Front cover of DVD shows Donatello holding the pizza pen. In my option, It should have been Michelangelo in Donatello's place.  I think Michelangelo fits on the cover of box-set design best because of his personality.  Hey, he is supposed to be the ""party dude."" And I also noticed that Leonardo isn't even on anywhere the box-set cover. It seems Raphael takes most of the light-spots on the box-set design, because he is there on the back of cover and inside a CD case, also, back of CD case as well. I feel that the box-set design should have include Leonardo not just three Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle heroes.

On the Title DVD menu I think they went a bit... well, OVERBOARD with the layout design. I think the pizza design on the box-set and the CD discs is good enough. They don't HAVE TO design the pizza on the DVD menu. I feel it is way too much. Making it harder for me to browse around the menu. I'd get fat and turned into green from eating all those pizzas!!!

TMNT set is classic and enjoyable to watch. I found myself rolling off the bed and laughing. All other episodes; are just, hilarious!

If you are like me, the perfection maniac, and likes to watch things in chronological order. Well, then you may have problem with Season 5 and Season 7. Manually because the episodes from season 5 and 7 is not in the correct order.

Many of you may be confused by this, since most often Volumes usually feature 3-5 episodes each and usually later on they will be made into Season box-sets where will feature those very same episodes from Volume; only that it would features the more episodes. This what got me really confused with TMNT volumes and season DVDs. And soon after that, I realized I had to buy ALL of Volumes as well Season in order to get most of TMNT episodes.

List of each what episodes are in each Volume or Season DVD.

Volume 1
9 episodes (4 bonus from 10th season.)

Episode 1-5

In incorrect order of 4 bonus episode from season 10
(Notice how episode 187 should be put first instead of episode 188... Don't ask me why it is arranged this way.)

188. The Beginning of the End
187. The Return of Dregg
192. Mobster from Dimension X
193. The Day the Earth Disappeared

Volume 2
13 episodes

Volume 3

Volume 6

Note: No, I didn't put 66 episode by mistake. It actually features Episode 66: Plan 6 from Outer Space TWICE in both Volume 6 and Season 4.

Season 9 & 10 Not yet released.

Final thoughts: I'd suggest you to wait to see if they will re-release these TMNT and maybe arrange the episodes and include the missing episodes.

As for the price of box-set or Volumes. I would say about 5-12 dollars is not too bad of deal because some of volume contents more than 8 episodes. Normally, you would pay a lot more when you get Volume that usually only have about 3-5 episodes each. which I think is a worth the deal. I have seen some of used one for under 6 dollars which I'd suggest you to get a used one if you can, just make sure, you watch out for feedback and seller's comment.

And I gotta hand it to Liongate for bringing most of the episodes that you can enjoy again. Unlike the retarded company Shout! Factory; Liongate includes the Closed Captioning that Deaf or Hard of Hearing can read words and able to enjoy this old TMNT show.

This is why I gave this season 5 a set 3.5 stars out of 5 stars. Because of two thing which hurts the rating, is the incorrect order of episode and 4 missing episodes.

And of course, 4-5 stars for volume 1-6, Season 6-8 No missing episodes from these each sets.)

1957508,3,B0000W5J9K,"Now we get another season set of the classic Ninja Turtles show, at least now they're keeping to the season sets that should've been in place in the first place.  While I'm not a fan of the packaging of this season set of the turtles, although its original but at the same time makes it a little uneasy if you put your DVDs on a shelf.  While we got 30 or more episodes from the previous two seasons, this season only had 20 episodes that make up Season 5, but there's only 18 of those episodes featured in this set.  I'm wondering if the people behind in putting this show on DVD are being lazy or just not knowing all the episodes that make up season and properly putting all the episodes that make up each of the seasons that they have put on DVD thus far.  Overall I give this set, 3 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,803,4.095541401273885
1957509,2,B0000W5J9K,"Here we are with may should have been called `Season 3: Volume 3', though it's just called `Volume 5'.  This set I would think that they would try to go about trying to make this set the rest of Season 3, but felt that they needed to keep going with the trend of releasing volumes instead of trying to make season sets.  For example, Transformers got more of a better releases compared to the treatment that the turtles have been getting thus far and which I would like to know why this treatment has got this far for the 1987 Turtles show.  We get the next 12 episodes making up the next batch of the show, while all on one disc, making it hard to try to fit that much information on a disc without having to maybe cut anything out of any of the episodes featured in this set.  Overall I give it a 2.5 stars out of 5.",1279756800,,818,4.09375
1957510,5,B0000W5J9K,"This set has alot of episodes included that alone makes it worth the money, but then they took it even further and created a small pizza box that holds the discs inside but still has an outer case that would still fit with all the other dvds in your collection!",1277942400,,261,4.24
1957511,2,B0000W5J9K,"Season 5 is the shortest single outright season release for the Ninja Turtles thus far. The pizza box design is nice, but the content is flawed. None of the episodes here are of stand-out appeal, the most memorable in my mind being ""Zac and the Alien Invaders"" and ""My Brother the Bad Guy"".

However, the 1-hour special ""Planet of the Turtleoids"", the two final episodes of the season, have for some inexplicable reason been left out. It's not as though they couldn't have fit them into the ensemble. They still haven't been released even with seasons six, seven and eight out, and this is absolutely inexcusable of Lionsgate. ""Plane of the Turtleoids"" is a vital piece of the puzzle that effects storylines later on in the series - not to mention is it awesomely cool. Is it because it broke the 20-minute time lap for each episode? Such petty details shouldn't deter such a respectable supplier.

One star is detracted for the rather low quality of episodes on this set. Two stars are detracted for leaving out Season 5's magnum opus. Lionsgate, Fred Wolf Films, see to it that ""Planet of the Turtleoids"" is released this instant. In the meantime, this is a decent set with a creative packaging (like a pizza box), but surely it had space for the specials? Of course it did!",1261699200,6,1276,4.666666666666667

Then upon looking at the case, I noticed that I was smashed! The DVD itself is great, works
flawlessly. But that isn't the point, the case should be in perfect condition as I bought it
brand new.

I'm really getting fed up of if receiving packages that are not wrapped up in bubble wrap
and end up getting damaged in the process. If this ever happens again, I am going to reconsider
in using Amazon for future purchases.

The quality is a bit less than I expected. Don't get me wrong ; the quality of the episodes are a way, WAY, better than VHS and almost as good as broadcast, but I really thought that something as popular (or once as popular) as TMNT would merit some restoration work. But maybe I'm just spoiled by the Restoration-Team.co.uk work on the Doctor Who dvds ! The only bad thing about volume 5 of the TMNT cartoon is on the second episode. Partway through the episode, there is an audio ""pop"", like a burst of static that lasts only half a second. Otherwise, this is a great dvd. The only thing that could've made it better would be behind the scenes documentaries or commentaries. All in all, if you're a fan of the Turtles, get this dvd.",1215129600,,885,4.242603550295858

1957529,5,B0000W5J9K,"I enjoyed Season 5 of TMNT. Many new mutants were introduced, like Mondo Gecko, Mutagen Man, Wingnut & Screwloose, to name a few. Baxter Stockman also returns as well. As stated, I'm also surprised they didn't put ""Planet Of The Turteloids"" on here; I'm sure they'll have it on the upcoming 6th season, which I hope will be coming soon. I guess I felt a bit cheated, since Season 4 had 40 episodes and this Season has almost half; Nevertheless, it's still worth the pickup (Especially for TMNT fans like myself.) Many of these episodes I've never seen until now (Including the upcoming 6-9th seasons.) There isn't too much of Shredder & Krang in this season, but when they're the focal point of the story, there's some  humorous moments; Especially since they're STILL at each other's throats. It's old slapstick humor of course; But still pretty funny for nostalgic purposes.

My kids range from 23 to 11, and believe me, this is a welcomed gift, to keep fun memories alive, when cartoons were supposed to be Fun to watch.

  Despite this, the packaging this DVD set comes in is awful. First, there is a cheap clear plastic slip cover on the outside; once that is off there is a small pizza box that is made of even cheaper cardboard. Once inside the pizza box, you will find a digipack with the 3 DVDs in it. This is a heck of a lot of trouble just to get a DVD out. Lionsgate did a great job with TMNT Season 4, they had a 5 DVD ""fatpack"" in which the DVDs were easily accessible.

Hopefully Season 6 will include these missing episodes.  It really gets annoying when shows are not released in proper order, or grouped properly.  The episodes are not in proper order on the DVD's, and there is no episode listing included so you have play each DVD to find the episode you are looking for. The background noise volume seems to be turned up louder than when originally aired (at least on the episodes I have watched so far), which sounded horrible on the Tranformers G1 DVD's (simulated explosions added in by Rhino).  This is not as annoying as transformers was, but sometimes the background noise drowns out the voices which irritated me.  Other than that this is a good set in a really cool Pizza box DVD case which was very clever, for one of the best Cartoons ever made!  But the simple things that I posted ruined my experience a little.  But I still recommend buying this set in order to get the entire series released.

1957546,5,B0000W5J9K,"On October 5, 1991, the second season (and fifth overall) of the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" debuted on the CBS network.  Riding a wave of almost unparalleled popularity at that time, the series had truly become a pop-cultural phenomenon.

This DVD set contains, to my understanding, 18 episodes of the fifth season of this series.  However, for reasons that I don't understand, two episodes from the end of that season, a two-parter that aired in primetime -- ""Planet of the Turtleoids"" -- has not been included in this set.  I am assuming that these episodes will be released in a later set (presumably the sixth season), but to not include them here is a shame.  Why Lion's Gate would skimp out on these two episodes remains to be seen.

However, that minor quibble aside, there are some other assorted goodies to feed the senses.  Continuing in the tradition that was set with the previous release, there are three bonus features included in this set:

""Heroes in a Half Shell"" featurette on the Ninja Turtles phenomenon
""Inside the Turtle Shell"" character portrait of Donatello
""Inside the Turtle Shell"" character portrait of the Evil Splinter

On a sidenote, it will be interesting to see if the voice actor behind Donatello makes any references to the other voice actor who sometimes portrayed Donatello in the third season.  I, in particular, have always been intrigued by this; to my memory, only Donatello and Raphael of the Fearsome Foursome ever had different voice actors at certain times in the series.  Donatello and Raphael had notable voice changes in some episodes of the third season (in ""The Turtle Terminator,"" both their voices are different...in the SAME EPISODE!), and a brand new voice actor gave voice to Raphael in the show's final season.  But I digress.

Any fan of this classic series (and I am one of the legions!) will pick up this release come August 7, along with a side-order of peanut-butter and pickled-beets pizza, a dish Michaelangelo would have loved.  There is much to savor in this three-disk set, ""Planet of the Turtleoids"" not withstanding.

This is because so many of the episodes on this volume were written by David Wise and Michael Reeves, who are famous for writing the very best episodes. On Vol. 4 they only wrote 3 episode but on this volume they write a handful of episodes each. This volume marks the first appearance of many new characters who would be regular guests in future episodes. Leatherhead and Usagi Yojimbo are introduced. The Rat King makes an appearance in two episodes and we meet the dangerous but funny Metalhead. Casey Jones appears in 'Corporate Raiders from Dimension X'. The Shredder and Krang are at top form and Rocksteady and Bebop are as hilarious as ever. These episodes are a perfect blend of humor, action and good story telling.

Corporate Raiders from Dimension X
Pizza by the Shred
Super Bebop and Mighty Rocksteady
