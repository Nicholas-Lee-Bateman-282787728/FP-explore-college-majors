2075867,4,B0002CA3RQ,"Columbia Pictures Corporation  presents ""THE GUNS OF FORT PETTICOAT"" (1957) (82 min/Color) -- Starring Audie Murphy, Kathryn Grant, Hope Emerson, Jeff Donnell & Jeanette Nolan

Directed by George Marshall

Cavalryman Lt. Frank Hewitt (Audie Murphy) deserts the Union Army to warn former Texas neighbors of impending Indian attacks triggered by Army massacre. He overcomes initial distrust and convinces the homesteaders (all women whose men are away fighting in the Confederate Army) to take refuge in an abandoned mission. He trains them to fight and shoot in anticipation of the attack. The only other man at the mission runs away o save his scalp and ends up leading the Indians back to the mission. Surrounded and outnumbered, the defenders prepare for the final assault

The cast and characters are interesting, Audie Murphy gives a very good performance letting us in on something that could happen.  Entertaining little gem that all but forgotten.

Good direction by George Marshall, with some of the best supporting cast around Jeanette Nolan, Hope Emerson, Jeff Donnell and Kathryn Grant (Mrs Bing Crosby).

Wonderful character actor Ray Teal, who was one of the most versatile character actors in the business. In his almost 40-year career he played everything from cops to gunfighters to sheriffs to gangsters to a judge at the Nuremberg War Crimes trials. He could play a kindly grandfather in one film and a heartless, sadistic killer.  Was Sheriff Roy Coffee on the long-running western series ""Bonanza"" (1959),

2075874,2,B0002CA3RQ,"This has the reputation of being a nifty little programmer, and it's nice to see Hope Emerson in a lengthier role than usual (although ""Caged""  probably contains her apotheotic performance), but the criminal neglect inflicted upon the great Ernestine Wade tanks the entire enterprise. Ms. Wade's participation was the alluring factor, here, yet she isn't provided with a single line of dialogue until nearly the end, and not even a worthwhile one. She rarely makes it into the frame, and never centrally. The raggedly preserved ""Amos and Andy"" episodes  remain the principal forum for Ms. Wade's fiery yet ever-empathetic presence and indelible comedy, leaving this Petticoat a missed opportunity in promising casting.",1393977600,,718,5.401785714285714

2075877,5,B0002CA3RQ,I have been an Audie Murphy fan for years.  My husband is a western movie fan.  We now have a grandson that is a big fan of westerns with Audie Murphy being his favorite actor.  His favorite movie is GUNS OF FORT  PETTICOAT.  We would have perferred to have a dvd but we are satisfied with the vhs.  I am sure we will continue to enjoy it many many times.  Thank you Amazon for making it available.,1348963200,,398,4.090909090909091
2075878,5,B0002CA3RQ,"Audie Murphy was the most decorated soldier of World War II. Surprisingly, after the war he became an actor in Hollywood, mostly in westerns. Although Murphy was not a great actor, he became a quite competent one. The Guns of Fort Petticoat has Murphy's character helping a group of women who are in serious danger from an Indian attack cleverly and successfully defend themselves. This is not a great movie, but it s a good western for Audie Murphy fans -- like me.",1330732800,3,466,4.626506024096385
8025863,4,B0002CA3RQ,"This is in many ways a typical Audie Murphy film. It is pretty good. The commander of a fort just after the Civil War decides to destroy an Indian tribe solely because the tribe left the reservation for a friendly visit. Audie Murphy, his lieutenant, warns him that Indians will join together for revenge against the whites. He refuses to listen because he was a Union soldier during the war, and so was Audie, but Audie came from Texas. The commander does kill many innocent Indians.
Audie rides from the fort to worn the civilians in Texas to expect Indian attacks. At first they refuse to believe him because he was a Union soldier. After they accept his warning, they join together at a single place. All the inhabitants are women because the men left to join the Civil War. However, there is one man among the many women, a bad man who causes problems. Murphy trains the women to prepare for the Indian attack, which comes. There is also a subplot of two women who want Murphy's attention.",1522800000,,994,4.558659217877095
8025864,5,B0002CA3RQ,"I am a big big fan of Audie Murphy and this is one of his best films outside of To Hell and Back.
The portrayal of pioneer women coming together to protect their stronghold from the retaliatory Indian raids.  Audie Murphy's character Frank Hewitt
warn the women of the Texas territory that, with their men away fighting the Civil War, they are in great danger.  Some 42 women and their children
assemble; Hewitt desperately trains them into an effective fighting force which triumphantly fights off the Indian attacks when they do come.
Frank Hewitt is classified as a deserter in the beginning of the film, however due to his heroism, Hewitt is vindicated at his court martial trial.",1519344000,,684,4.788135593220339

8025866,5,B0002CA3RQ,"This has always been one of my favorite Westerns, and, along with Seven Ways from Sundown, one of my favorite Audie Murphy movies.  Yes, the premise has been used before, but I love to see him interact with the women, and to watch him train them to use the firearms is even more fun than the watching the exciting battles themselves.  I love to watch him use those guns; he was sooooo good at it!  I can just picture him years earlier in actual WWII battle, snapping orders and making critical, life-and-death decisions, when I watch this movie.  (I read his book, To Hell and Back, and the title says it all.)  He is so decisive and quick here, keeping his guard up, so to speak, yet his undercurrent of vulnerability is just visible; the speech made by the older lady (forgot her name) in the heat of battle sums it up perfectly, when she says he yells at the ""men"" because he is afraid for and worried about them all.  Many wonderful character actors, mentioned by other reviewers, so I won't repeat them, round out the story, but my personal favorite member of the cast, next to Audie Murphy, is leading lady Kathryn Grant, who, of course, married Bing Crosby, and so stopped her career just a year or two after making this movie (too bad).  The ending is a little lame--too perfect and cheery, like a too-happy reunion--but overall, a most satisfying story and excellent Audie Murphy Western movie.",1492387200,,1403,4.565737051792829

8025871,5,B0002CA3RQ,"Why this movie hasn't been brought out on DVD in the US I can't imagine; it may be one of Murphy's best Westerns.  (I acquired my copy--in NTSC format--through an Australian seller on eBay and was overjoyed to find it.)  Murphy plays Lt. Frank Hewitt, a Texan who decided, when the Civil War came, that he had to cast his lot with the Union.  Assigned to one of the few remaining units in Indian country, he runs afoul of his CO, Colonel Chivington (an actual historic character), after the latter decides to attack a village of peaceful Cheyennes in retaliation for raids by the other kind.  Hewitt, being a frontier Texan and having more experience of Indians than the Colonel does, knows that this is just the push that will be needed to set off every warrior in the West--and with most Texan men off fighting for the Confederacy, their families back home will be in harm's way.  So he deserts and heads back to his old neighborhood.  The women left behind--including Stella Leatham (Patricia Livingston), whom he had once thought to marry--scorn him as a traitor and possible enemy agent, and it takes the death of one of them to help him convince the survivors that they must gather together to defend themselves; they can't flee to safety, for the Comanches have closed off the valley.  So they assemble at an old deserted mission, and there, like the boys at the Alamo, they make ready to fight.  Hewitt must teach them to act ""like soldiers"" and not panic when the foe appears--Miss Hannah Lacey (Hope Emerson), a graying, rawboned spinster whom he names his sergeant and second-in-command, is a priceless resource--while simultaneously dealing with Emmett Kettle (Sean McClory), the only other man available, who's not too eager to risk his scalp even though one of the defenders is carrying his baby, and a trio of rather slimy bad guys (James Griffith, Ray Teal, Nestor Paiva), who are quite willing to betray the fort to the Indians to save themselves.

This is a wonderful take on the Indian-fighting, we're-way-outnumbered-and-cumbered-by-green-troops motif that has been used repeatedly in Westerns; Miss Hannah is one of the best characters in the film, and one you're likely to remember for years (I did).  There's plenty of suspense, action, and character-driven conflict, as Kettle's lover tries to cope with his cowardice, Cora Melavan (Jeanette Nolan) insists that as a Christian she can't take violent action against others, Hewitt struggles with his attraction to both Stella and Anne Martin (Kathryn Grant), and a saloon singer and an old-line Southern lady are thrown into the mix of frontier farm and ranch women.  There probably ought to be more children in evidence for 20-odd 19th-century women, but that's a minor quibble.  It might be worth the while of Murphy's fans to bombard Universal (which apparently owns the rights to most of his movies) with demands that they make the movie available in Region 1 format.",1437523200,2,2944,4.913306451612903
