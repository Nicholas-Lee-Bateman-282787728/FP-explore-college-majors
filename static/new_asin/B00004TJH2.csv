1351177,4,B00004TJH2,"I loved the DVD, but it was definitely packaged for the bloodthirsty fans.  I am a practitioner of martial arts and while some of the more technical  groundfights may be boring for tourists and WWF fans who want to see a  brawl, there is a lot of strategy and technique involved.  Hits offers  little of the technical fights and provides a ton of the nastiest,  bloodiest fights the UFC has to offer.
While most of the fights are just  big brawls, they are still entertaining to watch.  Some of the later fights  featuring Belfort, Frye and Abbott show the values of cross training. One  trick ponies don't get very far in the UFC.
One big complaint is that the  DVD advertises ""multiple angle's"", which isn't particularly  accurate.  There is one multiple angle fight in the special feature's from  UFC 2, so don't expect to be able to switch the angle's around while you  watch all those old fights.  Won't happen.
The one thing the UFC taught  us is there aren't really superior martial arts so much as superior martial  artists, and this DVD proves it.",965692800,16,1056,4.616216216216216
1351178,4,B00004TJH2,"A good mixture of fights a real must have for Vitor, and Tank fans. There  are a few dodgy ones, but on the whole a great representation of what MMA  is all about.",965433600,,163,3.909090909090909
1351179,5,B00004TJH2,"This is a great, value-for-money purchase for the specific market niche UFC attracts, or martial artists and fight afficionados in particular.  Featuring several of the best (but not necessarily the ""top""  best) fights in UFC history, UFC Hits 1 includes interviews with Frank  Shamrock and Tito Ortiz as well as a multi-camera fight section.  Included  in this collection are fan-fave confrontations between the legendary Royce  Gracie & Kimo, Dan Severn & Mad Dog Macias, Tank Abbot & Don  Frye, Vitor Belfort & Scott Ferrozo, and Belfort & Abbot.
From  what originally seemed to be a showcase of Brazilian / Gracie jujitsu, the  UFC has slowly evolved into a forum which proves that the ""best""  martial art is really, truly eclectic, and one needs the right combination  of punching, kicking, trapping and grappling skills - along with luck and,  of course, a fighting heart - to emerge victorious.  And that no matter how  well one performs, there will always be someone better.
I highly  recommend this DVD not only to the UFC fan but also to anyone interested in  gaining even a superficial knowledge in realistic combat and in defending  oneself - using the martial arts - under life-threatening conditions.",964828800,16,1214,5.0201005025125625
1351180,4,B00004TJH2,"This video was pretty intense and at times it even made me cringe. It doesnt really feature the best fights, but more so the bloody one sided fights. Example, Pat Smith pummeling his elbow into some guys face, or Tank  Abbott knocking somebody out cold. The selection of fights for this movie  were good, though there was a few fights I think they missed. Another thing  is that probably about half the fights are shown already in progress, which  is all right if you just want see the endings of the fights. Showing some  fights allready in progress also made more room on this approx. 2 hour tape  for more fights. While I am reviewing this, I mine as well suggest you buy  this video instead of the second volume. The second one isn't nearly as  good, seems they used all their good footage for this one. As an avid UFC  fan, I was pretty impressed overall with the contents of this video.",964656000,5,892,4.423312883435583
1351181,5,B00004TJH2,"For great Martial Arts action buy this video.  UFC is a full contact  tournament with many different styles competing in one goal, to win by a  knockout or a submission.  Only downfall of this sport is that there aren't  many punchers or kickers to make the fights interesting.  The winners are  usually grapplers who takes their opponents down on the mat to make them  submit.  Not to say grappling isan't an effective style, but realistically  in real fights when your out numbered your not going to be able to perform  an arm bar or a choak hold, because opponent's friends aren't going to just  stand there and watch.  I have yet to see a fighter with a good kicking or  punching technique in UFC, only good grapplers like Gracie and Severn.  Overall it's the next best thing to seeing a real combat without so many  different rules.  So if your into Martial Arts or just fighting, you'll  enjoy this video.",961027200,5,911,4.5875

1351204,4,B00004TJH2,"We do some Gracie Jiu Jitsu at work, and I've boxed and wrestled in the past - these are some tough sons of guns here!  This is a fantastic compilation of some of the finest moments out of UFC history.  I've seen a number of individual UFC tapes that cover single championships, and this does a great job of compiling them.  I would have loved to see some of the Royce Gracie/Dan Severn fight, as it was amazing to see Gracie take 17 minutes of abuse from Severn and still get Severn to tap.  This is the real deal and I recommend it to any martial arts or boxing fan who wants to see what happens when there are virtually no limitations set on what the fighters can do.",1075248000,3,670,4.170542635658915
1351205,5,B00004TJH2,This is cheap as DVDs go but it is packed full of great scenes. If i remember this is 120 minutes and there isn't a lot of talking between matches. It just goes from one match to another. I don't follow UFC at all and i love this DVD.,1055548800,3,234,3.795918367346939
1351206,5,B00004TJH2,"I have both volume 1 and 2, and volume one is definitely the top choice.  Plenty of great action and a good way to see the evolution of the UFC and mixed martial arts.",1039219200,,167,3.911764705882353
1351207,5,B00004TJH2,"Ever seen a fool get his eyeball kicked out of his friggin head? How about watching a man get punched in the temple consecutively over 20 times and drain blood like a broken water faucet? No? That's probably because you've been watching the wrong sports.
This DVD is absolutely brutal. If you've got a weak stomach you won't make it past the first fight. If you don't you'll love this bad piece from beginning to end. People being punched out, kicked out, bowed out, choked out...aw man, it's just maliciously beautiful.
With this you won't see any of those long boring Gracie ""Ho-hum, I want to arm bar you."" fights. This is straight to the point. Hit play...and HE'S UNCONSCIOUS, HE'S OUT, HE'S OUT! I'd recommend watching this with your significant other and when you see Tank Abbott absolutely mangle John Matua and have him sprawled whilst seizing and locking up say ""The next time you act a fool, the Tank Abbott hammer-blow is gonna rain down on you like that.""
This is the party flick of the ages. If you like raw, passionate, angry, just...apocalyptic violence on humans by humans than you MUST own this. Buy now or you'll be visited by me and I will promptly knock you out with a Vitor Belfort Matrix-style Neo barrage attack like the one administered to Vanderlei Silva.",1020556800,5,1281,4.672566371681416
1351208,5,B00004TJH2,"""So far this event has been fast and furious. I did not see any discipline at work, i just saw swinging"". These are the words you hear when you start watching this DVD. They very well stress the character of this DVD. On this DVD you can watch the most brutal and toughest fights from the first events of the UFC. If you like wrestling or becomes enthousiatic when a fighter wins by a leg/arm lock or like chokes, you won't like a lot of the fights on this DVD. There is some action of that kind, but most of the fights show great knockouts, (with bare knuckle fist and in later events with gloves with open fingers), elbows to the back of the head (for example Paul Varelans vs. Cal Worsham) and the most effective low kicking (watch Marco Ruas vs Paul Varelans). You wil also get familiair with 'Tank' Abbott. Telling that he is not really a nice guy is a very big understatement.
The only thing that i regret with respect to this DVD, is the fact that from a few fight only the 'action' in overtime is shown. For example, the Maurice Smith versus Marc Coleman fight is historical in UFC history, but in overtime almost nothing happened. You can see that Coleman is 'out of gas' but how Smith puts Coleman in that position is not shown. They should have shown the action in this fight and from the end of the fight just the judges decision.
If you are an MMA fan and you have missed a lot of action of the first 16 UFC events, i would recommend this DVD to you.",1017360000,3,1463,4.247311827956989
1351209,5,B00004TJH2,"The first time I see this kind of fight was on video game with the same name. Until then, I've tried hopelessly to look for it in my country. No such luck! Until I bought it .... I can not believe that this kind of bloodsport do exist!! Although I am not a fighter at all,and I do not know any fighting discipline,  it is a very entertaining sport to see.
And a lot of my colleages agree with me. We have a ""new thing"" to talk about. I believe this kind of sport will continue to grow. It enriches martial artists and entertains common people.",1013644800,,543,4.122641509433962
1351210,4,B00004TJH2,"Lets go through that title again... a Great compilation of bareknuckle vale tudo developement... which means...
Great - It is great, it's a very well selected compilation of interesting and action packed fights from the early ufc days.
Bareknuckle - Yes, bareknuckles are still allowed in the UFC. Which makes for bloodier fights! If that's what you're into. I'm sure you probably would be a lot LESS enthusiastic if you were the fighter =)
Vale Tudo - Portugese for without rules. This is no rules, this tape shows the early days of the UFC where contestants were allowed to do things that have now been outlawed. Such as hair pulling, headbutts and holding onto the cage.
Developement - MMA fighting has devoloped since it's sudden discovery back in the early 90's in the continental US, and you will see towards the end of the tape, that as the UFC tournaments reached thier teens, all the fighters were cross trainers and most wore gloves to protect thier knuckles. Vale Tudo is still deveolping.
...So who are some of the fighters you're going to see? Well, of course you're going to see all the greats, Royce Gracie, Kimo Lepoldo, Mark Coleman, Tank Abbott, Vitor Belfort, Pedro Rizzo and more.
...And what kind of fights are you going to see? Not the boring ones! Which is why you should buy this great tape. I actually rate it 3.5/5, but hey, it's worth having anyway.",1001116800,5,1376,4.713692946058091

1351212,4,B00004TJH2,You will see.... A guy get kicked in the face when he's down on all fours.... A guy get punched in the noots 10 times by a Kung Fu Master.... A guy get punched square in the face while he is on the ground spazzing out after being knocked out.... And you'll also learn to never be excited watching Boxing again.... This is the most brutal UFC tape you can buy...it's a little on the extra brutal side as their are only about 5 submission victories on their....this isn't generally how matches go but it does show you why developing an effecting ground game will save you in any street fight. This tape features fights from the old days of UFC when their weren't many cross training fighters and we got to see how the different martial arts stacked up against each other...and how quickly it became apparent that Jiu Jitsu was the Kryptonite to the other fighting arts. This tape features tons of great KOs and is packed with fearless fighters. VITOR BELFORT's vs TRE TELLIGNAN and VITOR vs TANK are the two most spectacular fights I've ver seen.

Your service will depend on a lot of things but mine went up to 54mps with the lowest tier internet service.  Once I gave comcast my modem info I was up and running after 5 mins.

Unlike a review above, I did NOT need to give the ""customer serial number.""  However the Comcast reps asked for the ""s Mac"" number off the modem.  I didn't see one- just a hic MAC address so I gave them that and the model number and it worked. Never gave a serial number. keep in mind they can see what your modem is doing.  they could even see that I had a router attached.

7922878,5,B00004TJH2,"This disc rocks.  In reading the reviews here, I knew it would be good, probably more for its historical value than for its unfiltered excitement.  I was only half right.  It nails it on both.  This disc is a Who's Who of UFC, introducing one great fighter after another.  What's outstanding about this perspective is that alot of the clips are complete fights and not just the knockouts or subs.  They show fights lasting just a few seconds to the Gracie/Kimo 5 minute battle to the best rounds of marathon fights.  I can't say enough good things about this.  There's no time for a bathroom break in this barrage.  You will see early no-weight-class Davey/Goliath fights with Tank A. in 1000-seat arenas with a broken Octogon door to modern Vegas matches including IceMan, Ortiz and Randy C.

7922879,5,B00004TJH2,"This edition of UFC Hits takes us from UFC 1 all the way through to UFC 16, selecting choice fights from these events.

Royce Gracie is dominant in the earliest events, employing tactics that people simply weren't prepared to defend against.  Gracie then slowly gives way to new talent as it emerges. There are quite a few Tank Abbott fights included, also.  We get to see some of his most memorable fights and knockouts - but we then get to see the ""end"" of the Tank Abbott era when he meets young Vitor Belfort.  Belfort thrashes Abbott very easily, utilizing his amazing hand speed and power. With Belfort came a new, higher level of talent into the UFC.

The Belfort/Couture fight is one of the best fights on the DVD (if not the very best).  You will appreciate the fight regardless, but even moreso if you've seen their two more recent fights.  These are two truly amazing mixed martial artists early in their UFC careers.

We then see Frank Shamrock emerge toward the end of this DVD edition, at about the same time Tito Ortiz makes his debut (still a college student at the time).  There is a bonus interview conducted inside the octagon with Shamrock and Ortiz, as they were soon to face-off.  This fight is included on UFC Hits 2.

This is a great collection of fights - there are about 40 fights totaling 2 hours of action.  Classic knockouts, submissions and all-out battles... Highly recommended!",1142985600,5,1409,4.637096774193548

7922881,4,B00004TJH2,"Back to the real old days, we see Royce Gracie against Kimo.  That was a classic.  We see the early days of Tank Abbott bashing people.  We see Keith Hackney punch out a sumo wrestler.  I used to watch every pay per view event back then.  In what I consider the second generation of MMA stars, we see Don Frye belt some people out.  He was really very good.  Later on in the film we see some of the more modern stars.

This film reminds me of the days when MMA stars weren't well rounded.  The sport began as a showcase to determine which was the best martial art.  The BJJ guys cleaned up.  They cleaned up to such an extent that nowadays everyone knows BJJ, and there is no such thing as a one-dimensional fighter anymore.

One fight I'm surprised is NOT on this collection is the most important MMA fight of the early days - when Royce Gracie triangle choked Dan Severn despite being about 100 pounds lighter.

To this day, I love the Gracies.  I even took classes with a black belt who received his belt from the Gracies, and I attended a tournament run by Renzo Gracie.  Modern fans of MMA should realize that the point isn't that this or that star can defeat a Gracie in the ring.  The point is that MMA ""IS"" the Gracies.  No Gracies, no MMA.  It was the brain child of the Gracies, and they wrote the book on it.  So what if others took their teachings and can now beat them at their own game.  How can one family be expected to produce the very toughest men in the world generation after generation?  It's unreasonable to expect that.

It is unfortunate that Rickson Gracie never fought in the UFC.  My teacher told me that Rickson used to line up half a dozen Gracie relatives and beat them all easily, one after the other, like a chess master walking from table to table defeating a collection of players simultaneously.

To get films of Rickson, the greatest of the Gracies, you need to check out the Pride tournaments.  My guess is that Rickson in his prime would do very well against today's crop.  I'd love to see him against Andrei Arlovski, Randy Couture, or Chuck Liddell.  I wouldn't bet against Rickson.  I'd make him the favorite to be the greatest martial artist of our time.",1128729600,5,2196,4.368811881188119

Shows how their was at a time, just about no rules, the referee's were poor and missed tapouts and waited too long to stop fights.  Groin shots, headbutts, Hair pulling all legal, and over time, they slowly evolved into more of a sport.  I like MMA, I like old and new UFC.  But I think this is a great introduction to fans of the sport of MMA plain and simple.  Many of the fights are short and complete...some of the longer ones are either clipped or are shown in progress.  But by doing that it can give people a more complete scope of what UFC was and what it was turning into.  From a very dangerous tough man contest to a sweet science style combat sport.
