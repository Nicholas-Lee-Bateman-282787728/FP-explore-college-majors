8601666,4,B00E613LUA,"I have the boxed series (cofanetto) of DVDs of other cantos explained by Benigni. Those were so wonderful that I decided to purchase also these ones. After all, cantos XI, XII, and XIII are among the best of the Inferno. Benigni is good, as usual, at describing and reciting the cantos, but less than stellar in his comments. His pitiless comments against the suicides are unusual for a person as warmhearted as he is.
Also, these three performances were recorded in a studio, whereas the ones in the boxed series were recorded in the magnificent Piazza Santa Croce during a soiree with thousands of spectators. All in all, Benigni's lectures on Dante as still the only ones that don't put me to sleep. The DVDs arrived in excellent condition. --- For Region 2 only. I had to change the settings of my computer to see them.",1421366400,,823,4.6438356164383565
