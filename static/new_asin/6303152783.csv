600821,4,6303152783,"This had the misfortune to be made in the 80s. Charlie Brown specials weren't their best at this time. The music was post-Guaraldi and pre-David Benoit. For some reason, the voices and animation weren't good, either. However, it isn't the worst Peanuts special. (That award goes to ""Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown"")

  If this were made in the 70s, it would be great. The New Year plotline involves Charlie Brown's homework dilemmas and New Year Dances.

  If you want a good Charlie Brown storyline, this is fine. If you want good music and voices, no. I think I only watch this because it's a New Year special.",1104364800,8,620,4.694444444444445

Thanks, Patricia Blount",1196467200,,290,5.1063829787234045
7841300,3,6303152783,"By the 1980's, Charlie Brown's friends had lightend up on him a bit, but so had the dramatic texture of the stories.  This special is filled with cute, if not too memorable, songs and dances as the friends gather for an unchaperoned NYE party.  It is problematic that Charlie Brown is the ONLY one with homework.  Still, it's nice to start the new year with familiar faces.",1109030400,3,373,4.537313432835821
7841301,3,6303152783,"This peanuts video had some cute lines, the animation & music were fair but the voices were ""BADDDDDD"" which made this ""below fair"" video to watch.  Maybe if they tried to use voices closer to the original peanuts the video could have been a lot more enjoyable.

My advice is to rent & watch before you buy this one.",1104796800,5,316,4.338983050847458
