8528498,5,B008IG0E6I,"The Joubert's are the best when it comes to capturing African wildlife. Eye of the Leopard, The Last Lions and now this movie are some of my favorites. I also love their choice for a narrator (Jeremy Irons)and I believe they usually use the same guy. He has an incredible voice which I think adds to the entertainment of the movie. One of their other films, Living with Big Cats is sort of a documentary about themselves and it is what inspired me to work towards a career in big cat conservation. One thing I love about the Joubert's films is that they are educational without feeling educational. They are always entertaining and they don't romanticize anything. They show you the reality of living in the wild and do it beautifully. I've watched many other documentaries about big cats and I always feel like the narrators are either ""dumbing"" everything down or the opposite,  making things sound more complicated than they are. They really stepped up their game in this film. The camera angles are really incredible and very artistic in a way. You will fall in love with this clumsy, handsome leopard. I highly recommend this dvd to anyone with a love of Africa and big cats. I also highly recommend the Joubert's other films as well especially Eye of the Leopard. Check them out you won't be disappointed!",1348185600,12,1311,4.7
