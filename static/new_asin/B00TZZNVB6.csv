8703635,3,B00TZZNVB6,"This is a brief but enjoyable nature film with some very cute scenes of baby and adult pandas and interesting information on China's efforts to protect the few remaining pandas and to even try to expand the wild population with pandas born in captivity. Two warnings. If you want to share this with small children, be ready to do some explaining about the early scenes showing pandas mating as well as artificial insemination of an anesthetized female panda. And this may apply only to the Amazon Instant Video version, but there are no closed captions available. This was disappointing to my hearing-impaired mother-in-law although she still enjoyed seeing the pandas.",1440892800,5,669,5.090909090909091
