You get it.  I really enjoy the old movies, because they had to rely so much on story and acting to be entertaining, and this one did not disappoint.  I think it was even more enjoyable after having finished watching the mini-series, knowing some of the back-story of the relationship between Davis and Crawford.  Both actresses did a terrific job, and the directing was spot-on - they really did so much without all the whiz bang action blowing up pyro-technics which modern-day films rely on.  Good job ladies, thank you for your legacies!",1510358400,,708,4.64

Unlike today's cheap trash, these old movies didn't have to rely on blood & gore & special effects to be scary...just real talent in writing, directing & acting.  There will never be another actress on the level of Bette Davis.  The restoration of the film is also great - it looks like the movie was made yesterday.",1509494400,,393,4.430555555555555

852758,5,6304359721,"You've heard of Daylight Noir?  Well, consider this one Daylight Horror.  Two movie-veteran sisters, one a straight actress and the other a ""daddy's darling"" type from the early years, hold each other captive.  Surely if Joan Crawford and Bette Davis didn't hate each other before Warner Bros. made this shocker in 1962, they did by the time the movie is over.  But the motivations for these sisters are not all we think they are.  This was Victor Buono's first credited movie role, for which he received both Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations.  BABY JANE can be punishing, but represents quintessential psychological horror.",1509062400,,634,5.106796116504855

Betty Davis was the one that made this movie what it is.",1505952000,,299,4.381818181818182
852981,3,6304359721,"A 4 star movie and 2 star transfer. This movie is just owned by Bette Davis, she is wonderful. Joan's quietly suffering saint routine gets a bit annoying, but there it is. It's a little too long, and while I like it I am just of the opinion it's overrated. My main problem is the poor quality transfer. Black and white movies are trickier than color and this one is a perfect example of how NOT to do it. Lots of sparkling grey scale issues. The Universal Monster movies from the 1930's look much better than this. Overall, I would recommend waiting for the 4K version to come out unless you are a total fan-boy or girl.",1505952000,,620,4.3076923076923075

But she brought the whole system to its knees. She's got more balls than any man in Hollywood history. So when they pic up their Oscars on Academy Award night...the first works out of their mouth should be ""THANK YOU BETTE DAVIS!!!"". She was nominated for an Oscar on this on, & should have won it.

Had previously seen some snippets from TV runnings of the movie.  Rating the whole movie, I found it to be average in entertainment value. It got somewhat boring at times. If you're expecting a really high quality entertainment along the lines of say, Double Indemnity or something like that, you will probably be disappointed.

853824,5,6304359721,"After all these decades, this film still holds up as a classic in the horror genre. Bette Davis proves that blood, gore, on-screen violence, and special effects aren't required to create a sense of horror; all it takes is good acting. Davis was nominated for an Oscar for her chilling performance, and had she not been competing in a year that had 5 such outstanding entries, including Anne Bancroft's winning performance in _The Miracle Worker_, she may well have won, Joan Crawford's efforts to the contrary notwithstanding. Crawford is also very good, although she looks a little TOO good for a woman who has been a wheelchair-bound recluse for 20 years. (Her improving appearance as she dies on the beach is particularly odd.) Yes, this film holds up very well and is still among the most bone-chilling horror films ever made.",1496361600,,830,4.8936170212765955

My kids and I happened to be watching the ""Feud"" series on Fox and rented ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" from Amazon to compare it. It was so amazing to see how accurately the T.V. production recreated the scenes, and it's actually a great movie!  What a treat to be able to rent it and watch it contemporaneously with the T.V. show!",1495929600,,393,4.24
853831,4,6304359721,"I had just finished watching Fox TVs series called Feud: Bette and Joan which portrays the lives of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis while they were making Robert Aldrichs film.  It will certainly gather a few Emmy nominations and I thought Id go back and look at the actual film they made.

The film opens in 1917 and Baby Jane Hudson is a 7-year old vaudeville performer who is one the eras biggest stars.  She sings, she dances (think Shirley Temple) and shes also quite a brat.  Her slightly older sister, Blanche winces at Janes behavior, but Dad and Mom put up with it because Jane makes the money.  Twenty years later, the circumstances are reversed.  Jane (Davis), now an alcoholic actress struggles to get parts and when she does, shes terrible.  Blanche (Crawford) on the other hand becomes a huge star, something Jane despises.  It appears the filmmakers were able to splice in real vintage footage of the actresses in their youth.  Crawford was quite stunning, something Davis resented.

The sisters share a house in a well-to-do Los Angeles neighborhood (shot in Hancock Park).  Returning home one night, the electric gate is stuck and one of the sisters goes out to give it a nudge.  Suddenly the driver, puts pedal to the metal and drives into the sister and the gate.  The story picks up many years later in the early 1960s.  Blanche is now confined to a wheel chair upstairs in the mansion.  Jane begrudgingly brings her meals served on a silver tray.  Not only is Blanche chair ridden, but Jane is becoming more and more disturbedmentally, that is.  Jane still wears a blond wig similar to her appearance as a tyke.  She chain-smokes, is constantly pounding down Scotch and Gin in her usual attire of bathrobe and slippers.

Jane decides shes had enough of Blanche and begins to slowly terrorize her, serving up disgusting dinners which eventually leaves Blanche close to starvation.  While Jane is enjoying punishing her sister, she decides to look for a musician to help her restart her career, mimicking her Baby Jane performances.  In his first credited big screen role, Victor Buono plays Edwin Flagg and won an Oscar nomination for his work.  The film tends to have lapses of credibility on occasion as Blanche cant seem to get anyones attention that shes being abused.  Flagg visits a couple times.  The next door neighbors seem nosey enough, but Blanche cant seem to get their attention.  A note of trivia here.  The teenage neighbor is played by Daviss actual daughter Barbara Merrill and like she was portrayed in the TV series, she isn't a very good actress.  But Davis and Crawford are.  Both give noteworthy performances.

Davis has a larger range of emotions and gets an opportunity to go off the rails which got the attention of Academy nominators (Anne Bancroft won and Crawford accepted on her behalf) as well.  Crawfords role as Blanche is toned down and level most of the time.  This is consistent with her character who wishes no ill-will toward her sister, recognizing she has mental issues.  Technically, the film is well made.  Excellent direction by Aldridge and some fine camera work by Ernest Haller.  The movie, began a series of films featuring actresses on the downslide of their careers (including Davis and Crawford).  In some circles the films were known as grande dame guignol.  Less charitable names included psycho-biddy or as studio head Jack Warner called them hag horror.  In any case, the film is pretty good and worth a look.",1495843200,,3480,4.8175675675675675

Two scenery chewing divas in a battle to the finish. Joan Crawford's head must have exploded when Bette got the award. It has nods to the decline of Hollywood (premature).

I guess these two women were so good at their craft, there was no wonder they didn't get along in real life.  I suppose there was only room for one diva? (chuckle) They sure made a great film.

My initial reaction is that it became a bit tedious. Couldn't wait for it to get over. Very predictable. I stayed with it til the end out of respect. Scenes shown on the ""Feud"" series spoiled the ""surprise"" ending but considering the way the opening scenes were shot it wouldn't have been much of a surprise anyway. Very surprised Victor Buono actually received an Academy Award nomination for what was some pretty poor acting. Must have been a bleak year for actual acting. No nuance to his portrayal. Again the ""Feud"" series filled in some of the back story very nicely as Buono was a homosexual who faced getting busted for lewd activity in public but got off from prosecution. Buono went on to play less than memorable roles in the old Batman cornball show and appearances on other forgettable TV shows. Bette Davis really stole the show as Crawford sat in the background. Davis probably should have gotten the Oscar nomination but when have the Oscars not been a political statement.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? [1962] is so much more than a horror film and depending on whom you ask, it's a campy but deadly dark comedy, a chilling physiological thriller, or one of the most disturbing dramas ever made about the fringe of Hollywood fame. Part of the joy of watching the film again and again and again is deciding what kind of film it is, and what is really going on beneath the Hudson sisters many layers of psychological deception.

The two screen divas known for their outsized egos, mercurial temperaments and larger-than-life personalities, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were icons of their day. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? film exploited those notorious personalities and the equally infamous tension between the two screen legends. The pairing of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford was, by most accounts suggested by Joan Crawford herself, who had worked with Robert Aldrich on the film Autumn Leaves [1956] and claimed she had always wanted to work with Bette Davis. Robert Aldrich saw the perfect vehicle for the two stars in Henry Farrell's novel about a bizarre tale that was a chance to resuscitate both actresses' flagging acting careers with a novel, publicity-generating concept.

The story begins in 1917, where Baby Jane Hudson is the darling child star of the vaudeville circuit doted on by her starry-eyed stage dad, while her stern sister Blanche is constantly ignored by him. Their mother promises young Blanche that someday it will be her turn in the spotlight, and when that time comes, she entreats her to forgive Jane her childish spite and spoiled brat antics and follows the melodramatic tale of two rival sisters clinging on to the remnants of the fame of their youth, played by Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. Opening on a Vaudeville stage, we see the golden-curled starlet Baby Jane [Julie Allred], who draws in fans with her cutesy and later utterly terrifying rendition of I've Written a Letter to Daddy. Watching on from the wings is the begrudging young Blanche [Gina Gillespie], ever in the shadow of her sister's stardom.

Then, the narrative jumps to 1932, where Blanche is a major movie star and Jane has fallen out of fashion in part because of her drinking problem and temperamental nature. All of this is laid out in a lengthy scene by two studio executives, before the sisters head home for a fateful night that will shape them both forever.

Another leap in time takes us to 1962, where the Hudson sisters are cloistered in Blanche's mansion, where she is crippled from that terrible incident decades ago and depends on Jane for her every need. But years of resentment, recrimination, and lies have curdled any love between them into a rank and file of hatred that fuels a mind-bending game of cat and mouse. Both women fantasise about a life free from each other; Blanche looks into selling her house and essentially fleeing her sister, while Jane begins prepping costumes and song numbers for her envisioned comeback. However, their years of mutual isolation have inextricably entangled their fates.

The combined screen presence of Davis and Crawford is still one of the film's brightest draws, especially as each discards their typical grace and charm to create a gruesome portrait of sisterhood gone sour. Caked in ugly slabs of pancake make-up, Davis deftly and dramatically spins between Jane's feuding personas of coarse drunken hag and petulant, spoiled child. Hers is the showier role, but Crawford's restrained performance as the shuddering self-made martyr keeps Davis's menacing performance from veering into clownish. They work in tandem, keeping the balance between the heart-wrenching but theatrical drama and the blood-curling yet absurd horror.

Their caustic chemistry is so entrancing those scenes without one or the other feel frustratingly flat, especially because these are mostly filled with exposition-heavy dialogue and largely irrelevant characters talking about Blanche and Jane's backstory. These, plus some hammy supporting performances, cross fades, and awkward zooms date the film a bit. But Aldrich's directing sings in the scintillating scenes between Davis and Crawford that are so layered that each re-watching makes you question afresh what truth is and what a lie is. Ultimately, the film WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is still an incredible tour de force drama that challenges audiences with its twisted game.

Despite mixed reviews in the press, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? film was a box office hit, which eventually grossed $9 million and undoubtedly attracting audiences who relished the campy, extreme spectacle of two former screen diva giants, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, chewing the scenery in this unforgettably bizarre, gothic horror production. And yes, that is Bette Davis' daughter; Barbara Davis nicknamed ""B.D."" in the small role in the film as the teenage girl next door. In Bette Daviss autobiography The Lonely Life, Bette Davis claimed ""Joan Crawford and I got along famously much to the huge disappointment of the Hollywood press,"" most eyewitness accounts tell a different story. Even before filming was underway, the stars reportedly bickered over salaries and who would receive top billing. A great deal of friction was apparently also generated mid-production by Joan Crawford and Bette Davis's very different acting styles, which helped the film generate a big love and affection for this film and of course having it has a massive cult following of fans of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video has once again brought us a stunning 1080p encoded black-and-white image, with an equally impressive 1.85:1 aspect ratio image. The black-and-white picture features inky black levels and impeccable contrast, giving cinematographer Ernest Hallers beautiful light-dark imagery a great presentation. Though fine detail can be a bit limited in some wide and establishing shots, hair, skin texture and fabrics look incredibly well defined. The films native grain structure also appears uncompromised, with no evidence of excessive noise reduction measures. Some of the early title cards are unnecessarily window-boxed, but despite this, overall it is a very good presentation.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video has presented us with a 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono sound track that is consistently clear, detailed and intelligible. The film score and sound effects are firmly centred with the front sound speakers, and the track exhibits a decent sound depth, and the audio recording has strong depth and dynamic range with no signs of strain or distortion. Special highlight is the composer Frank DeVol where the atmospheric music is especially highlighted, and his film music score employs elements of early rock 'n' roll and creepy harpsichords within a melodramatic framework, which really helps bringing the music to the forefront, making its impact even more noticeable, especially with the soothing, melodic, harsh and dissonant tones that nicely fill the sound experience, exuding a newfound fullness and depth. Though at times the music competes with the dialogue, it never overwhelms it and a key point considering the polished nature of the brilliant sharp script.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary by Charles Busch and John Epperson: Here we are introduced to the two acclaimed and legendary LYPSINKA Drag Artists performers to do the film audio commentary, which seems like a strange move on Warner Bros. part, the audio commentary track is actually not bad, at times anyway. The duo is prepared with various background facts and anecdotes, they have a working knowledge of the film industry, and, most importantly, they are of course great fans of the film, but now and again they do wander off in stuff that went right over my head. Die hard film fans probably will not get much out of the audio commentary, but anyone new to the film WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? should find this audio commentary well worthwhile listen. Charles Busch wrote and directed the Bette Davis tribute spoof Die Mommie Die! and John Epperson has performed brilliant drag shows for decades under the stage name LYPSINKA and who is the more chattier, more  gossipy, and more trivia-laden audio commentary this reviewer generally prefers, but nevertheless it offers a fair amount of well-informed and intelligent history, background, and aesthetic information about the film, the process of making the film, and how it works to be both casually enjoyable for giggles, as well lots of gossip and is well worth listening to in its entirety for further knowledge and frame of reference towards this classic film. Charles Busch and John Epperson were very surprised when asked by Warner bros. to do this audio commentary, and they feel they are the NEW Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. They both praise the stunning black-and-white cinematography and especially the lighting and wished more films were made in this process, but they inform us that it cannot be done in black-and-white film stock today; instead films have to be filmed in colour and then turned into black-and-white in the laboratory. They also give great praise about the well-designed clothes, which I suppose is only natural with their business and also praise Bette Daviss clothes, which were perfectly designed for that period. They talk about the famous camp lines spoken in many classic Hollywood films, which they relish in, especially ones by Bette Davis in this film. They also give great praise and love for the character actress Marjorie Bennett who was an Australian-born television and film actress, who worked mainly in Britain and the United States and is the fourth sister to Enid Bennett, Catherine Bennett and Alexander Bennett and also loved her British cockney accent and loved the films that Marjorie appeared in, especially in the Joan Crawford film Female on the Beach [1955] playing Mrs. Murchison the house keeper to Joan Crawford. What really got on my nerves is their total obsession with Joan Crawfords hands, whenever they did a close up shot of the hands and wondering if they were Joans real hands or someone elses hands, to a point of total annoying obsession. As we come to the end of the film, the two commentators Charles Busch and John Epperson thank each other in enjoying watching this film together and hopefully will be asked back by Warner Bros. to do the audio commentary for the film Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte, and they also hope we enjoyed watching the film with them and especially enjoying their camp and barbed comments in general, but of course I would have to leave that ball in your court, as I personally only liked half of their comments, as they tended to wander off into their own little world and talk about stuff that went right over my head.

Special Feature: Bette and Joan: Blind Ambition [2005] [1080i] [1.33:1] [29:50] This special feature documentary, features a very insightful look at the parallel acting careers of the two most iconic film stars, namely Bette Davis and Joan Crawford and how they altered their personalities over the many years with their acting careers. We also get lots of archival film clips, archival materials and interviews. This feature also creates a dual examination of the acting careers of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. It also looks into the early starts in their work and proceeds throughout their years in Hollywood and we hear all about the ups and downs of their careers and the bitter rivalry between these two iconic diva actresses. Contributors include Tom Toth [Film Historian], John Anderson [Film Critic for Newsday], Charles Busch [Actor and Writer], Boze Hadleigh [Author], John LYPSINKA Epperson [American Drag Artist/Writer], Charlotte Chandler [Biographer], Rudy Behlmer [Author/Film Historian], Dr. Drew Casper [Professor of Critical Studies in the School of Cinematic Arts at the USC], Carol Kane [Actress], Paul Clinton [Film Critic], June Springer [Spouse of John Springer: Publicist of Joan Crawford], Karen Swenson [Biographer], James Ursini [Film Historian/Critic] and Glenn Erickson [Film Writer].

Special Feature: Behind the Scenes with Baby Jane [Vintage Short] [1962] [480i] [1.33:1] [6:39] Here we are presented with a very rare vintage black-and-white promotional film, with an interesting look at the moviemaking process for the film WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? and featuring rare on-set footage with director Robert Aldrich examining camera angles, composing shots, and shooting an exterior sequence with Bette Davis. Unfortunately the black-and-white video quality is very bad, but still very watchable for something of this very rare viewing experience and a really great insight into the filming techniques.

Special Feature: The Andy Williams Show [Vintage TV Clip] [1962] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:07] This is a very fun but very short TV and also equally a very rare one where we see a short excerpt featuring the actress Bette Davis on the American Variety Television Series The Andy Williams Show, and it is also equally impressive to be viewed in colour, where we get to see Bette Davis sings a cute ditty set to the rock 'n' roll theme that sporadically plays during the Baby Jane soundtrack, and nearly performs the Twist, which was the dance craze during the 1960s period. Despite it being far too short, it was still great to see this rare item on this Blu-ray disc.

Special Feature: All About Bette [1993] [1080i] [1.33:1] [48:12] Turner Pictures Presents an Ellen M. Krass Production of a special look at the career of actress and star Bette Davis and is hosted by the actress Jodie Foster, who focuses on the long career of the actress Bette Davis, and especially the multitude of films this well-seasoned actress has appeared in and spans the period from 1971 to 1987. We also get to view a few amusing outtakes from Bette Davis's Warner Bros. film career, and especially a very rare television commercial from the 1950s. We also get a 1981 interview with her son Michael and some 1971 statements from her sister Barbara on the Ralph Edwardss This Is Your Life in 1971, as well as director William Wyler, and actors Paul Henreid and Olivia de Havilland. We also see Bette Davis on The Dick Cavett Show in 1969 and 1971 speaking about her life and times of her career in films. We also get to view some rare black-and-white funny outtakes. We also get to see Bette Davis in a rare scene from The American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 1971, also Good Morning America in 1981. But we also get a pleather of film clips from the many films Bette Davis appeared in and there were far too many to list here.

Special Feature: A Film Profile: Joan Crawford [1967] [480i] [1.33:1] [28:37] American film actress and Hollywood star Joan Crawford discusses her 42 years in the film business with Philip Jenkinson [17th August, 1935  11th March 2012] who was an English cinema specialist, journalist, BBC television presenter and film collector and his collection was known as Filmfinders. Philip Jenkinson questions Joan Crawford, who still looked glamorous at age 63, and talks about her films, fellow actors including John Barrymore, Greta Garbo, Elizabeth Taylor, and of course, the infamous diva Bette Davis, as well as the film industry in general. ""You manufacture toys, you can't manufacture stars,"" snaps the regal diva actress Joan Crawford, who is alternately frank, charming, and oh-so-affected during the interview. Lengthy clips from 'Grand Hotel;' 'Mildred Pierce;' 'Humoresque; 'Possessed' and of course 'What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?' and reminds us what an impressive body of work Joan Crawford accumulated during her six-decade acting career. This feature is both a blessing and a curse, because while it is nice to hear so much from the actress, but doesnt remotely approach any candour about the fellow actress Bette Davis. Joan Crawford throws out a few mildly interesting remarks about her performances and her co-stars. Despite such a short interview, it certainly packs in a lot of interesting anecdotes and information. As we get to the end of the interview, I loved the final comment by Ms. Joan Crawford in saying; So much money to be made or lost, so much talent to be made or lost to, which relates to a comment Philip Jenkinson says that when making a film in the 1960s era is almost at a committee level, with so many vested interest and such a lot of money to be made or lost, and there are so many people who want to have their little bit, who want to have their little say, it seems to me that this is a sort of diluting process. Too right!

Trailer No. 1: [1962] [1080i] [1.78:1] [2:24] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for the film WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? which incorporates some of the footage and generally a way of overselling the film's scary thrill factor, but done in a fun way. This is in fact the same item you witnessed in the special feature Behind the Scenes with Baby Jane [Vintage Short] and featuring rare on-set footage with director Robert Aldrich examining camera angles, composing shots, and shooting an exterior sequence with Bette Davis. But of course this time you get to see it in its proper 1.78:1 aspect ratio and a much better quality black-and-white image.

Trailer No. 2: What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? [Dan-O-Rama Movie Mix] [2006] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:21] Here we get to view a very bizarre music video that enhances scenes from different Bette Davis and Joan Crawford films as well, that is done with very flashy video effects, with some colorization effects thrown in for good measure and sets them to a 1960s style Baby Jane rock 'n roll ""remix"" song. This particular Trailer is so totally over the top, gaudy, gimmicky done for the 2006 Special Edition DVD release that incorporates Bette Davis's most famous and worn-out sound-bites from the film and hearing the aforementioned singing duo Bette Davis and Debbie Burton and the only place in this package you can hear that sweet, odd bit of movie memorabilia, that is well worth a look, despite its total over the top silliness.

BONUS: Here we have a beautiful printed 38 page Limited Edition DigiBook, with massive amounts of printed material incorporated into the packaging includes an essay about the film in general, information the actors like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, director/producer Robert Aldrich, also Trivia gems about all aspect of the film, a great deal of numerous gorgeous black-and-white photographs from the films production and rare promotional film posters from around the world.

Finally, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? may be the last film ever made with the beautifully realised dreams of the Golden-Age Hollywood still stuck in its head; since it was conceived and shot in the early 1960s, well after the most glorious true coming of those dreams had last been tenable, it makes for a nightmarish, unhinged, disorienting, absolutely transfixing oddball nightmare of a film whose amusing, light conventional ""horror"" genre masks a disturbing, strangulating decrepitude and a truly shocking, genuine horror genre, particularly for any deep-down film lover who happen to find themselves in its grasp. Fans of classic Hollywood cinema will appreciate the fine details Warner Home Video have packed into this Blu-ray disc WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? and Warner Home Video delivers a fine presentation for Bette Davis and Joan Crawfords late-career psychological thriller, especially Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? that had  a blend of the old and new elements that attempt to honour Baby Jane's reputation as an incredible film as well as a totally over the top camp classic, and the Blu-ray disc's special features are ultimately a mixed bag, but totally fascinating. As to the awesome restoration of the film is done so masterfully and makes this Blu-ray well worth the price of admission. For first-time purchasers of the Blu-ray title, the 50th Anniversary Edition is the best choice available. Highly Recommended!

One thing I knew, if jealousy and hate grow up to be Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, you could count me out! I love my sister dearly and am happy to say, not one iota of jealousy either. Perhaps Miss Davis' performance inspired me to love, who can say? These girls don't hold back! The acting is exhaustingly real, venom and spite are spot on. I sincerely think Botox has robbed us of the intensity of great acting. Note, this is a pre-Botox film.

856376,5,6304359721,"A former child star has been steadily losing her grip on reality to the point of alcoholism, sibling cruelty, hallucination and even murder.

Double billed it with The Uninvited.

Whether this disturbing, but highly enjoyable film should be horror or not is certainly debatable, but it certainly is part of the Gothic horror tradition (set in a decaying, former 'glorious,' manor), and while for the most part it is high camp melodrama, it reaches sublime moments of hysterical horror here and there.
There certainly seems to be no lack of former child stars gone bad (the ones with good lives are the exception for the most part,) and you can make predictions even now in the knowledge that they are certain to become true... What future for Honey Booboo?

Bette Davis is unbelievably creepy... see the moment when she says ""How did she like it?"" mocking her sister's inquiry about her old film. It's enough to give you nighmares. Joan Craword makes it clear that she's hidhng something - no one could be that ""perfect."" And Victor Buono is great as a struggling musician ready to take advantage of the situation.

The film has also been quite influential, it almost has a torture porn vibe and even a novel/film such as Misery owe it quite a bit.

A classic. Not to be missed.",1446422400,,1278,4.713004484304933

Warning: If youve never seen this movie, don't read this review because it contains major spoilers.

If you look past Whatever Happened to Baby Janes horror, suspense and macabre humorwhich is undeniably entertainingyoull find a very fascinating and compelling character study of two women whos bad trips left them cold. Jane and Blanche are definitely very unlikeable (we are not supposed to like them of course) but not so much to the point where I felt detached from Blanches plight or didn't care to try and figure out what was going on for Jane all those years to make her act so crazy.

Jane started out as a child star on stage and screen but lost her appeal as she grew older and couldn't find work in Hollywood. Blanche, on the other hand, cant make it big in childhood but becomes a major star as an adult. Jane squanders her grief in booze and becomes exceedingly jealous and vindictive towards Blanche even though Blanche is kind enough to open her home to her. She embarrasses Blanche in public with her drunken antics and mockery one too many times and one night while they are driving home, Blanche makes an extremely plastered Jane get out to open the gate so she can run her over. Jane dodges the car in the nick of time and runs away; Blanche, on the other hand has broken her spine. Still intent on revenge, she wiggles out of the car and lies on the ground to make it look like Jane did it when the cops arrive.

Twenty years later, they are both out of a job and living off the remnants of Blanches success in a wealthy neighborhood. Blanche is confined to a wheelchair at the mercy of Jane, who takes away her telephone, kills her pet parakeet and puts it in her food as a joke, neglects or delays in bringing her meals and takes her sweet time answering the buzzer when she needs somethinghence the old saying What goes around comes around.

At first Blanche fights to break free of Janes psychotic reign but finally she resigns herself to her fate realizing this is divine retribution for trying to kill her sister. Before the police find her, she tells Jane the truth about the accidentJane was so drunk that night that she didn't remember what happened. Blanche told her and the cops that Jane did it and held this over Janes head all these years. She begs Janes forgiveness for causing her to slowly slip into insanity by making her feel so guilty over a crime she didn't commit. And for a moment, Janedamaged though she iscracks a compassionate smile for the first time, gently strokes her hair and says with all the pathos in the world And all this time we could have been friends.

Jane leaves Blanche for a moment to fetch her some ice cream when the cops arrive (presumably she was tipped off by her pianist who saw a glimpse of what was going on in the house) and ask her to show them where Blanche is. The other people on the beach gather around to see what is going on and Jane, delirious with joy that she is finally getting the public attention she missed so much dances for them. The ending never really explains the fate of the sisters but one can easily infer that Jane will be sent to that nice little place where they can look after me and Blanche will get the medical treatment she needsthat is if she hasn't died yet.

And all because Jane and Blanche choose to eat each other away with hatred and resentment in a constant competition on whom could be the most successful all those years when they could have tried to mend fences and build a meaningful relationship.

Bette Davis and Joan Crawford literally swallow the scenery with their powerful performances. Even though Ive just seen this movie for the first time two weeks days ago, I couldn't help but replay certain scenes just to pay attention to every little detail and nuance of their facial expressions and body language.

Davis plays up Janes senility to the hilt yet there are several moments when she shows soft traces of humanity indicating that there is more than just plain villainy and madness going onno one dimensional characters here! The scene where she picks out one of her favorite songs from childhood is so heartbreakingespecially when you hear the voice she had as a little girl as she is reminiscing on the past and the close up of her face as she slowly walks towards the porcelain dollits an unforgettable expression. She dances and acts in front of the mirror for a moment as if she is still in her Shirley Temple days only for the spell to be broken by Blanche hitting the buzzer for lunch. Her mood immediately changes and she plunges into a creepy yet hilarious rant ALLRIGHT BLANCHE HUDSON! MISS BIG FAT MOVIE STAR! MISS LOUSY STINKING ACTRESS! Press a button. Ring a bell and you think the WHOLE DAMN WORLD comes running don't you! And the slamming of the piano lid with the strings reverberating and Blanches reaction was just icing on the cake. Then Jane fixes her food, looks down at the dead parakeet on the platter with a crafty grin and the camera pans away to the Baby Jane porcelain dolla representation of the sweet little girl she never was. Its a brilliant scenefunny, sad yet scary all at the same time.

Crawford embeds Blanche in an intricate woven fabric of sweetness and gentility but drops several hints throughout that the innocent damsel in distress is not so innocent after all even before the final revelation on the beach. Look how she kept buzzing over and over when once or twice should have been enoughor she could have just wheeled her chair over to the stairs and shouted to get Janes attention. Look at her wimpy, pathetic attempt to get the neighbor ladys attention that she was prisoner in her own rooma crumpled notewhen it would have been so much easier and more effective to holler out the window or throw a heavy object that would shatter as soon as it hit the pavement. Its like she didn't want freedom bad enoughshe wanted it given to her in a nice little box wrapped up with a bow on top instead of fighting for it. However, when Jane quits feeding her for a couple days, her pride is broken and NOW THAT THE PRESSURE IS REALLY ON she finally GIVES IT ALL SHES GOT to get down the stairs to reach the telephone.

The photography, costume and set design are all terrific and look like a series of charcoal sketches and the editing is sharp and crisp with plenty of close ups of the sisters faces as well as effective camera angles like the ceiling shot of Blanche rolling her chair around in circles after getting a dead rat on a platter for yet another dinner prank.

So why four stars instead of five? Well, there are a few aspects of the film that detracted me from fulling enjoying it and giving it March Boy Best Picture and Director Nominations despite all the other technical trophies I threw its way.

The supporting cast is somewhat lackluster and when you're up against the likes of Davis and Crawford, you better kick butt if you want to make a great impression. Victor Buono and Marjorie Bennett as Edwin the pianist and his mother are so flaky and cartoonish you wish they would just leave the screen. Barbara Davis (the neighbor ladys daughter) line delivery is so pathetically poor and monotonous, its obvious the only reason she got the part is because she was Bette Davis daughter.

But since the positives largely outweigh the negatives, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane still gets a solid four and a half stars from me. As for my quibbleswell I always know how to hit the fast forward button.",1445990400,,7834,4.592274678111588

857391,5,6304359721,"Here is the film for anyone who wonders about the cruelty of Hollywood in regards to the sad fate of any Child Star.  In 1962, nominated for 5 academy awards, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis as genuine Icons of Hollywood were sensational in this thriller.  Betty Davis is cast in the role of the ex-child star Baby Jane Hudson and Joan Crawford acts in the role of the crippled sister who had always lived in the shadow of her Sister the Star?!  This is a Hollywood Classic - and haunting in content to compare to the tragic end of any child star in our present age.  The special features included in this DVD enlighten this movie as a shocking thriller.  However, this movie and special features can give insight to the real life tragic end of child stars who grow up and are discarded from the movie scene. Here are two icon actors - Joan and Bette - who display their famous feud on screen to drive such tragic possibilities into probable realities.  Those classics of the 1960s are magnificent and speak to the problems of today in their own idiom.",1420761600,,1050,4.471204188481676

857586,5,6304359721,"This movie really is something.  I had seen Bette Davis once before in The Petrified Forest.  Let's just say this role was a bit different rom that one.  She is outstanding and flat out scary in this role.  What is interesting is that she and Joan Crawford had a real life feud in their day and in the movie, Crawford weighted herself down with rocks I believe when Davis had to drag her across the floor.  So while the acting is great, a bit of it might be real as well.  There are lots of crazy moments, twists and laughs in this one.  A must have for any fan of David or Crawford.",1418083200,,583,4.106194690265487

858130,5,6304359721,"This movie is standard viewing for anyone who has an interest in films that goes way beyond entertainment. Bette davis is the star here and she shows how an ordinary  grand guignol plot can conceal unbelievable insanity.
Davis plays a person so devoid of reason it becomes horrific. Joan Crawford was afraid of Bette Davis on the  set and she should have been.

Watch Bette Davis switch from memory of her past triumph as a child star to roaring madness. She does this many times, and then she  changes more subtly, and at the end it is clear she is baby Jane at 10 years of age or less once more. And then the dance begins.

858504,5,6304359721,"There are certain movies that everyone should view in their lifetime; ""The Godfather"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Citizen Kane"" and""To Kill a Mockingbird"" to name a few. I would argue that ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" should be included on this list.

As the film opens we meet Baby Jane Hudson dancing and singing away on a vaudeville stage in 1917. She's a cute child star cut from the same cloth as Shirley Temple, but we also see that once she's off the stage she's a spoiled brat. Unable to punish his star daughter, Baby Jane's father takes his anger out on his other daughter Blanche. And within five minutes we begin to understand the odd dynamic between these sisters.

Flash forward to 1935, and Blanche has become the big motion picture star, while Jane is now living in her shadow. Because of Blanche's star power, she is able to have written into her contract that the studio must produce at least one movie starring Jane for each film Blanche appears in. The studio heads don't care for the perpetually drunk Jane, and feel she has little to no talent. One night after a Hollywood party the two sisters arrive home and there is a terrible car ""accident"".

Flash forward to 1962. We see a mother and daughter watching an old Blanche Hudson movie on TV, and we learn that they are actually the Hudson sisters' neighbors. We also learn that the Hudsons' are seen as eccentrics, staying behind closed doors, not accpeting visitors, and that Blanche has been crippled by the ""accident"", leaving Jane to be her caretaker.

I don't want to spoil anything about this film, so I will stop there with the detailed plot description. What follows is a tense thriller as Blanche is basically held hostage by her insane sister. We see Jane slide futher and further into lunacy, and it's a frightening journey.

What really drives this film are the performances by Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. Watching the usually strong willed Crawfold play a near helpless victim is amazing, and the film would not be nearly the classic it is without Crawford's presence, but it's Bette Davis that does the heavy lifting here. When Davis is onscreen, you cannot take your eyes away from what she is doing. Every move, every line, every expression is just a fascinating to watch. The direction by Robert Aldrich is wonderful, he creates such tension, and the whole film is filled with an ominous atmosphere.

I honestly can't give this film any higher praise, this is a MUST SEE movie, and one you would want to add to your collection as this is a film you will want to revisit again and again.",1397779200,,2580,4.646929824561403
858505,5,6304359721,"I am so happy to finally have this movie on dvd.  I have the vhs from back in the day but the tracking went bad on me.  True what they say about vhs, some will deteriorate without question.

When I first viewed this movie, yearssss ago, Bette Davis scared the crap out of me.  Talk about hateful and evil.  She was it in this movie.  When Amazon finally got this movie back in stock I jumped on it.  The fact that I am 50 and this is the 50th Anniversary Edition makes having it that much more special.

This movie is a classic and a must have for both Bette Davis and Joan Crawford fans.

I had seen this film several times but it never fails to intrigue. The odd thing is, Jane, as Blanche's keeper of sorts, is somehow sympathetic because the martyr complex of Blanche is annoying and Jane has to carry the heavy meal trays up the stairs, let alone cook all her meals. Of course the rat and the parakeet served up in a covered dish are ghastly. Crippled Blanche, is dependent upon her sister,but  you wish she'd get up the gumption to tell Jane off. Since Jane thinks it was she who crippled her sister, she feels obligated to take care of Blanche but only on her own terms of persecution. The  two old broads agonizing away is nirvana but Davis, slopping around in her slippers, hideous blonde wig and garishly painted lips and eyes remains with you, surreal, like a Dali painting.",1394841600,,915,4.573170731707317

858948,5,6304359721,"What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is a 1962 American psychological thriller starring Bette Davis & Joan Crawford. The screenplay by Lukas Heller is based on the novel of the same name by Henry Farrell.

In 2003, the character of Baby Jane Hudson ranked #44 on the American Film Institute's list of the 50 Best Villains of American Cinema. The film's success led to the birth of the ""psycho-biddy"" sub-genre of horror/thriller films featuring psychotic older women, among them Aldrich's Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte and What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?

It was an open secret that Davis and Crawford loathed each other, and filming was contentious as their real-life hatred for one another spilled over into the production, and even after filming had wrapped. Davis and Crawford get off some amusing and chilling displays of seething hatred and general monstrousness. The irony of two once idolized and wealthy females living in such depravity, and the pathos of their deep-seated envy having brought them to this, wash out very quickly under the flood of sheer grotesquerie.

Although the results heavily favor Davis (and she earns the credit), it should be recognized that the plot allows her to run amok through all the stages of insanity. Crawford gives an quiet, fine interpretation of the disabled Blanche, appropriately emotionally restrained by the nature and temperament of her role.

The neighbor's daughter was played by Davis' daughter B.D. Merrill who, following in the footsteps of Crawford's daughter Christina, later wrote a memoir that depicted her mother in an unfavorable light.

The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one for Best Costume Design. Davis claimed that Crawford lobbied against her among Academy voters. At Oscar time, Crawford was infuriated when Davis was nominated for an Oscar and she was overlooked. She contacted the Best Actress nominees who were unable to attend the ceremonies and offered to accept the award on their behalf should they win. When Anne Bancroft was declared the winner for The Miracle Worker, she was in New York performing in a play, and had asked Crawford to accept her award if she won. Crawford triumphantly swept onstage to pick up the trophy. Davis later commented, ""It would have meant a million more dollars to our film if I had won. Joan was thrilled I hadn't."" As Davis and Crawford had accepted lower salaries in exchange for a share of the film's profits, Davis considered it foolish of Crawford to have worked against their common interests, especially at a time when roles for actresses of their generation were hard to find.

TV Guide awarded the film four stars, ""If it sometimes looks like a poisonous senior citizen show with over-the-top spoiled ham, just try to look away... As in the best Hitchcock movies, suspense, rather than actual mayhem, drives the film.

In the United Kingdom, the film was originally given an X certificate in 1962. In 2004, the film was re-submitted for a theatrical re-release, and it was given a 12A certificate, now meaning persons under 12 years of age could view it if accompanied by an adult. It remains at this category.",1385769600,,3149,5.009560229445507

858952,5,6304359721,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this 1962 mega classic...

What else can be said about What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? (1962)?  Simply put, it's an all-time classic that stars Academy Award winners Joan Crawford and Bette Davis.  Crawford and Davis hated each other in real life, so for them to be together in the same movie...is explosive.  These two actresses each gave the other a hard time during the filming, to a certain extent.  Basically this movie is about two sisters who are feuding, so the real life feud between Davis and Crawford I think provides extra fuel to each actress's performances.  Both Crawford and Davis shine in this movie.  Davis sings and dances a little in this movie.  Davis was nominated for an Oscar, which was her tenth Oscar nomination.  Watch for Victor Buono (King Tut from the 1960s Batman TV show) playing the piano.  This is a highly entertaining, suspenseful, shocking, and at times funny movie that was a huge hit when it hit theaters 51 years ago.  Watch it.  See what unfolds.

This DVD comes with many extras, including profiles of both Davis and Crawford.  They are ""Bette And Joan: Blind Ambition"", ""All About Bette"" (hosted by Jodie Foster), and ""Film Profile: Joan Crawford"".

859087,4,6304359721,"Whatever happened to Baby Jane is a complex yet simple movie that explores the darkest relationship possible between two sisters. It's filled with fascinating tension between two siblings, but beyond that the life of childhood stars and their changes once reaching adulthood and being cast aside. Beyond this, it even explores the themes of jealousy between siblings, as well as how they're affected from the loss of one parent. And...finally, it explores the relationship between the disabled and who they're dependant upon, as well as the problems with two adults living together in general.

 It has to be mentioned that Joan Crawford and Bette Davis had a major rival offscreen, and this may have flavoured their rivalry in front of the camera. Crawford stars as the disabled and sweeter sister, Blanche Hudson, while Davis is Baby Jane Hudson. Basically, the film starts with Baby Jane Hudson as a small child on stage, gathering and reveling in the audiences attention. Her father, mother, and sister Blanche stand by the door, only one of them unhappy. You see, Blanche has a jealousy of the attention Baby Jane is getting from the audience, as well as the favoritism from the father. When Baby Jane throws a hussy fit and proves how spoiled she is, Blanche's mother takes her to the side and gives her a small talk on figuring her sister and how it will all change later.

Cut forward many years and the roles have changed. It's seen that Blanche's career has taken off and that she is now gaining more attention than her sister. Her sisters tantrums have made her too difficult to work with and she now primarily gets jobs only because of her sisters power. Blanche suffers a strange and unexplained accident and ends up disabled and crippled for life. It then cuts forward even farther in the years, where both women live together, single, their parents dead, and without careers. Enter sibling rivalry major time. Baby Jane seems to taunt her older sister, keeping her fearful of what she eats, cutting her off from the world, while dissolving into her own little fantasy that doesn't exist, unable to let go of the past and accept that her childhood charms have abandoned her.

Whatever happened to Baby Jane is a clever tale that is always intriguing, captivating, and even sad. Drama is heavy, character development is the main point, and the ending is a bit of a shocker - tragic.  It shows that who's who may not really be. The saddest thing about the film is that all three main characters in the film (this includes the would be suitor) are all desperate, run-down, and disillusioned by life to the point where they're all severely emotionally disturbed.

The only way this film could have been improved would have been if they played up the cruelty bit. The pacing was slow, which was fine, but showing a bit more wouldn't have hurt it a bit. Overall it's a great movie, very intriguing, and even one Steven Spielberg named as his favorite haunted house flick. Sad, disturbing, suspenseful, you name it.",1379635200,,3022,4.801923076923077

Baby Jane is director Robert Aldrich's masterpiece, and this is the man who made the explosive&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dirty-Dozen/dp/B002M809JK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dirty Dozen</a>&nbsp;and the brilliant film noir&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-Me-Deadly/dp/B004S801YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss Me Deadly</a>. Gothic in it's setting and cinematography, tense and suspenseful in plot, darkly comic and blackly funny, Baby Jane would be considered ""good"" anyday, but it is the two electrifying performances from Bette Davis and Joan Crawford that elevate it into ""great"" territory.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bette-Davis/dp/B004LQEYOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bette Davis</a>, the most fearless actress of the Golden Age of Hollywood, acts as demented ex-child star Baby Jane Hudson. Did I say ""acts""? Bette Davis embodies Baby Jane to the point that every movement, every word uttered from her lips, every word of sneerful disdain, every act of twisted glee, her every aspect is inseparable from the character. Jane is one of the most memorable and twisted villains in cinematic history; cruel, spiteful, delusional, demented, and obsessed; Jane is part&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gloria-Swanson/dp/B003PVPXOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gloria Swanson</a>&nbsp;meets Mrs. Bates from Psycho, only worse. Davis, or should I say Jane, absolutely chews the scenery with every scene! You might think that with her delusions of past grandeur - her girlish gait, her caked makeup and curlicues, her bratty pushiness and stubbornness - that she was a mere delusional old lady, but that is not the case here.

Baby Jane is one of those characters like Harry Powell from The Night of the Hunter or the Shark from Jaws, that are threatening because, no matter what the hero does, no matter where he goes, what he does, or who helps him, the villain never goes away. Jane is always there, and she is always cooking up some new way to torment, torture, and psychologically unsettle her sister...and the audience. It seems there is no length that Jane will not go, and that is also the case for Bette Davis's electrifying performance!

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joan-Crawford/dp/B004WKH4PS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joan Crawford</a>&nbsp;gets passed up a lot in the attention/praise department, but mostly because she has the more subtle, less showy role. In my opinion, her performance is equally brilliant as Davis's, since she manages to show her considerable emotional range and talent as an actress, through a relatively confined and difficult role. Crawford's character is extremely relateable and sympathetic, and director Aldrich invites us to grip the edges of our seats in horror along with Blanche Hudson, the crippled former-star, as we explore her desperate crusade to free herself of her demented sister. Scenes like Blanche's stair scene showcase some of the finest acting ever seen in psychological thriller history. Blanche Hudson may not have had the strength to go up against Baby Jane, but Joan Crawford certainly gives Bette Davis a run for her money!

...

While the two leads seem the most obvious place to level praise, it is easy to forget the incredible cinematography and camerawork. The editing is very tight and effective, and climactic scenes (car runover scene, rat scene) have editing so gorgeous you want to watch it in slow motion. Many of Aldrich's shots are so visually stunning they remind one of Hitchcock and Kubrick, so perfectly framed were they. The shadows would make Billy Wilder jealous, and the lighting gives those eerie shadows, Gothic darks, and glinting eyeballs that makes noir and oldschool horror so effective. We must also thank the screenwriters for their suspenseful, twisty, immensely creepy screenplay, with it's razor sharp, acerbic, and witty dialogue.

The result? An immensely entertaining, gleefully creepy, haunting, tense and incredibly atmospheric psychological thriller film, featuring the gloriously over-the-top performance of Bette Davis, and the understated but brilliant Joan Crawford as two of the most memorable and conflicted siblings ever put to celluloid. My rating? 4.5 budgerigars out of 5.

P.S. The behind-the-scenes conflict between Davis and Crawford was almost as famous and enduring as their onscreen battle. Joan wore a weightbelt during the dragging scenes, and Bette retaliated by whinging and bad-talking Joan behind her back. Joan made her comeback at the Oscars, and Bette retaliated by...how much time do you have? Cheers!",1377820800,,5060,5.950481430536451

As an adult, I can see the dynamic of Joan Crawford competing for the same attention that went to the title role Davis plays.  The action on the screen mimics the antics of both actresses off screen as they compete for the stronger presence.  According to reliable sources, some of the ""screen slaps"" were real and each actress was equally vengeful in trying to ""one-up"" her antagonist.  Crawford and Davis play the theatrical Hudson sisters who were successful at different times in their lives, only the Crawford character (Blanche) has been more successful and therefore, controls the finances. The primary conflict is set on an accident Blanche suffered as a younger adult that has placed her in a wheelchair now at the mercy of her embattled and embittered sister, Jane, played by Davis.  Jane, who is determined to relaunch her career as a dancer and singer, is a convincing foil to Blanche in  ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,"" a good study of jealousy and insanity.",1374710400,,1144,4.661691542288557

859302,5,6304359721,"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE was a pivotal movie for me. I was still in my 'teens when this film was released and all I knew of the real life Bette Davis and Joan Crawford was that they had once been famous movie stars. I had never even seen MILDRED PIERCE or ALL ABOUT EVE. To my young and uninformed eyes, they were only two old ladies who wore too much makeup.

Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO had been a blockbuster a year or so earlier and BABY JANE was being hyped as a new shocker in the same mold. There was a lot of pre-release publicity for this film and it became a ""must see"", especially for the teenagers.

Actually, this film had very little in common with PSYCHO except for the fact that it, too was a charachter study. I remember being completely mesmerized by Bette Davis's performance in this film. I don't remember having ever seen such a powerful portrait of a disturbed woman before. Bette earned her tenth Academy Award nomination for this movie, and it was well deserved. As a dramatic film, it's great.

Thanks to the highly underrated Joan Crawford, it's also a top-flight Suspense film.

I became an instant Bette Davis fan because of this movie. I liked Joan Crawford too, but her part was far less showy and Bette got most of the critical attention. Steve Allen even parodied BABY JANE on TV with Steve as Blanche and comedian Louis Nye as Jane.

This film became my bridge to dramas made before I was born. I relentlessly scoured the TV Guide and discovered a world of great movies and actors that I had been hitherto unaware of. Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Humphrey Bogart, Ida Lupino, GONE WITH THE WIND, THE MALTESE FALCON, REBECCA, and all the other greats were waiting for me to dicover them for myself.

This new Blu-Ray is the ne plus ultra of BABY JANE DVDs. There are several documentaries including a Bette Davis Biography hosted by Jodie Foster, a British interview with Joan Crawford that had never been shown on American TV in its entirety, and interviews with various celebrity critics and movie historians.

Almost The most fun of all is a clip from The ANDY WILLLIAMS show in which Bette croaks out her non-hit ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane"" and does ""The Twist"".

The piece de resistance is a video clip called Dans Baby Jane (I think). It is comprised of clips from the movie re-arranged and set to the single version of ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane"" (the song) sung by Bette Davis and Debbie Burton. Debbie Burton also provided the voice for young Jane's version of ""I've written a letter to Daddy"". It's hilarious.

If you don't already have a copy of BABY JANE on DVD, this is the one to get. Even if you do have a copy of Baby Jane, you might want to upgrade to this.

It's the ultimate Cult Camp Classic movie.",1372982400,,2763,4.519038076152305

Jane and Blanche Hudson were both stars: Jane in vaudeville as a child, Blanche as an adult in movies. Blanche's screen career ended with a crippling car accident and Jane now cares for her in their Hollywood mansion, where both live as virtual recluses while waging psychological warfare on each other. Blanche is constantly demanding servile attention, while Jane's jealousy and loathing of her are amplified by TV reruns of Blanche's films-- she takes revenge in madly sadistic ways. Blanche grows weaker from starvation and is certain Jane's trying to kill her.

(8.0) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) - Bette Davis/Joan Crawford/Victor Buono/Wesley Addy/Julie Allred/Anne Barton/Marjoroe Bennett/Bert Freed

BABY JANE TRIVIA--

Nepotism: Robert Aldrich's son William plays the beachside lunch counter assistant. Bette Davis's daughter Barbara Merrill is the curious teen next door.

Davis had a COKE machine installed on the set to annoy Crawford, who was on PEPSI's board of directors.

Victor Buono's role (Edwin Flagg) almost went to Peter Lawford.

Shakespearean actor Wesley Addy (Marty McDonald) was married to Celeste Holm.

During the kicking scene, one of Davis's kicks caused a wound in Crawford's head that required stitches to close.

Bert Freed (Ben Golden) originated the TV role of Lt. Colombo, on ""The Chevy Mystery Show,"" in 1960.

The scenes of Jane's early flops are from Davis's ""Ex-Lady"" and ""Parachute Jumper,"" both released in 1933.

Davis and Buono were both nominated for Oscars.",1372896000,,2078,6.2020905923344944

I have seen this movie many times and there are a few moments in this version that I don't ever remember seeing. The kicking of Blanche by Jane is trimmed a bit also. The extras are the real delight here. It is everything available about the stars from that time period. There many recordings of Bette Davis on TV shows at that time and in one she sings ""A Letter to Daddy"". If you want just one movie with extras about these 2 great divas then this is the one to own. The bluray also comes with a short booklet where I read that the daughter of the neighbor - Mrs. Bates - is played by real life daughter of Bette Davis - BD.

I first watched this movie in the 70's when it was gaining popularity as a cult classic with lots of campy humor. Upon watching the movie in 2013 I have a different reaction to the movie. I work with many families that are in abusive relationships and this movie is an excellent portrail of that.

Two sisters living a jhorific  life; one in a wheelchair dependent  completely on her nut job of a sister. Betty Davis is living in the past and she's about as nutty as a fruitcake but  a treasure to watch. Joan Crawford is magnificent  as the wheelchair bound sister who is slowly going crazy because of her sister's pranks, mean tricks and generally not-all-there mindset.  These two ladies were two of the biggest stars in Hollywood and these performances may have won them an Oscar (who remembers). The story is simple but a bit scary and at times you're sure Davis has gone over the edge of sanity. Do not miss this movie.

859773,3,6304359721,"The film has some surprisingly good camera work by Ernest Haller, who often makes the most out of scenes that could have been workaday, some exceptional scenes of dialogue between the two screen titans, and some well and judiciously placed scoring, by Frank DeVol. There are some trite scenes and moments, as well as some repetitive scenes. For the former, see the murder of Elvira, where the viewer just knows that when she lays down the hammer she has doomed herself to a braining by Jane. For the latter, see the scenes showing Jane taking Blanche out of their home in a wheelchair- just as she had with Elvira's corpse. Also, the scenes with the sisters' neighbor, played by Anna Lee, add nothing. Another annoyance are several scenes where Blanche and Elvira are `racing against time' to do things before Jane returns in her car, but are things which would take only a few seconds to accomplish versus the reality that Jane's errands would take her far longer to accomplish. This missynchronicity rents the `realism' that the film, by and large, hues to.

  But, other than that, this film largely succeeds, and rises well above the claims of campiness that have dogged it. What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? is not great filmmaking, but it is not a B film, nor schlock. From the obsquiouusness of Buono's Flagg to the taut fear and control neediness of Crawford's Blanche to unexpected shots that subvert expectations, the film has simply terrific moments that derivative films that followed it, like Aldrich's later Davis vehicle, Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte or Rob Reiner's Stephen King penned ripoff, Misery, cannot touch. My recommendation is that anyone coming to the film, for the first time, avoid reading too much about it, as well as any of the volumes written about Crawford's and Davis's egoistic battles, and just let What Ever Happened To Baby Jane? wash over them. Yes, many people will, like critics and fans, imbue their own misinterpretations into the film. But, for that small group of people with a clear mind and an appreciation for great things, even if sandwiched between mediocre moments, the film will be a revelation whose joys reach into not only one's heart and wit, but also into one's mind, that place where humanity begins and ends. Just ask Blanche Hudson. Da Lady done knows!",1359676800,,2312,4.877862595419847

Also,(and this is even MORE annoying)in the same scene, after the nurse says ""Hold on please, I'll see if I can interrupt him"", they completely cut out the shot of Baby Jane walking from her car towards the house....granted, it's maybe only a 5 second shot, but why did they do this?

860044,5,6304359721,"I would be surprised to find that there is someone who does not know of this movie and is actually raeding reviews on it. This is one of favorite movies of all time. I first saw it as a child when I was far too young to apprecaite the subtleties of the psychological thriller. I just gota kick out of Blanche being served dead parakeet and rat.

Over the years I have come top apprecaite that beneath it's cult classic and gay camp status, this movie does have a very subtle level of creepiness and fear built in. The scene where Blanche, confined to her room, can hear her sister's descent into madness as she sinmgs to herself downstairs and then comes out of her fantasy ytoo see her image in teh mirror, is masterfully done. The idea of being helpless ion a dark old house and hearing that maniacal singing echoing up teh stairs followed by blood curddling screams, is just chilling.
Jane being found in the garage by the next door neighbor after she has dragged a body into her car, is another subtle but chilling scene. Out of the darkness, we are suddenly confronted by the white powedered, dark red lipsticked horrible face of a maniac stepping into the circle of light from a an overhead bulb.

One can get so caught up in the camp that it is easy to miss the many quick and subtle scenes that make this a chilling movie.

The acting is superb. Even Joan Crawford's typical, scenery chewing, over the top acting style works for the character she is portraying.

The deep shadows and dark corners of the set and the overwhelming feeling of depression and decay in the old mansion adds to the overall ominous feel of this movie.",1355443200,,1635,4.45819397993311

860050,4,6304359721,"One classic movie that somehow escaped my eyes in the 40 years I've walked this Earth is ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" I know that in many people's eyes, any credibility I have as a movie reviewer just went down the tubes and I'm sorry. Thanks to Warner Bros. and their obsession with releasing every film on Blu-ray I've now had the opportunity to see it in high-definition.

There's no denying the power in the performances of both Joan Crawford and Bette Davis as they spar off each other throughout this brilliant thriller. My only complaint is that the 133-minute running time could have been cut down by trimming some of the fat off the edges.

Two sisters live together in a large house in the heart of Hollywood. Ex-child star ""Baby"" Jane Hudson is forced by circumstance and guilt to take care of her crippled ex-movie star sister, Blanche. ""Baby"" Jane begins to descend into madness as she reflects on her loss of celebrity. She takes her frustrations out on Blanche in many maniacal and cruel ways. The handicapped sibling must find a way to escape the clutches of ""Baby"" Jane before it's too late.

Warner Bros. did a superb job at restoring this beloved film. The black and white picture gives it a moody atmosphere it wouldn't have achieved in color. The shadows and camera angles are key to the tone each particular scene is trying to evoke. The high-definition transfer enhances the viewing experience. It's never looked so clean and vibrant.

Consumers will no doubt be disappointed in the movie's 1.0 Dolby Digital sound. Why Warner Bros. wouldn't give this movie some sort of stereo upgrade is beyond me. It's certainly one of those iconic pieces of Hollywood gold that deserves it. That being said, it does sound as good as it ever has in the past. Viewers will be distraught If they're expecting an immersive experience in which you feel surrounded in auditory bliss.

This anniversary edition contains some wonderful special features. It includes a 40-page booklet filled with cast and crew biographies, ""Making of"" stories, trivia, publicity posters and stills, and pictures from the film. There's commentary by Charles Busch and John Epperson, three documentary profiles entitled ""Bette and Joan: Blind Ambition,"" All About Bette"" (hosted by Jodie Foster), and ""Film Profile: Joan Crawford."" A behind-the-scenes documentary and an excerpt from the 1962 ""Andy Williams Show"" show featuring Bette Davis are found. The ""Dan-O-Rama Movie Mix"" and a theatrical trailer round out the bonus material.

The ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Anniversary Edition"" Blu-ray treats this cherished treasure with the respect it's due when it comes to a visual restoration and interesting extra features. The lack of any sort of sound upgrade is disappointing but this edition still delivers in all other avenues. The movie stretches itself a little thin at times and could have been a bit shorter. A great ending, elegant cinematography and disturbing performances by the lead actors more than make up for that shortcoming.",1351468800,,3037,5.003960396039604
860051,5,6304359721,"I have the 2006 edition and would order the 50th anniversary if there was additional commentary by more serious and better informed people who don't view Bette Davis and the movie merely as ""camp.""  They seemed unprepared. For example,  the two male commentators didn't know anything about B.D.'s biological father, a successful and well-known commercial artist and magazine illustrator?  They often said ""maybe this"" and ""maybe that"" (why didn't they do some research?) and they often talked at the same time or merely mumbled. A positive note: There was some info on the character actress who played Victor Buono's mother. And I agree with them that these kind of horror or psychological-horror movies are much more effective and interesting when filmed in black and white, rather than in color.",1351209600,,797,5.162790697674419

860138,5,6304359721,"By 1962 Joan Crawford's career was at a standstill. Her fourth husband, Al Steele, had died and left her broke so she tried desperately to find a film project that could give her the financial security she needed and to put her back on the A-List of Hollywood actresses. This was by no means an easy feat to achive as Crawford was well past 55 and during the early sixties most films were ""men's pictures"" with women having supporting roles.

 Joan found the book ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and loved it. She went to Robert Aldrich (her director on ""Autumn Leaves"") and told him this would make a wonderful movie. She then went to Bette Davis (whoses career was also in the toilet) and advised her the roles of Blanche and Jane were tailored made for them. Bette, not a true fan of Crawfords by any means, loved the book and immediately signed up to do the picture with Crawford. Bette plays the title role of crazy Jane and Crawford played the crippled sister confined to a wheelchair as Jane torments her with unbridal passion.

 Upon the release in November, 1962 ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" became a certified hit and restarted the careers of Davis and Crawford's although neither would appear in a film as successful as ""Jane"" for the remainder of their careers.

 As for Crawford she hated doing the film with a passion as the role required her to tone down the glamour that she was known for, but knew she had a hit on her hands. When signing her contract she asked for a bit of cash up front, but wanted 10% of the film's profits that were enormous. On ""Baby Jane"" Joan made well over a million dollars. When asked in later years about ""Baby Jane"" Joan would say it was one of the hardest movies she made because she felt ""as if they were filming a newsreel, not a movie"" and she found Davis to be ""a challenge to work with"". Bette also had a few words to say about Joan especially when it came to Joan's alcohol consumption. Bette later said ""Crawford read every line off cue cards because she was so drunk she couldn't remember her lines and that Joan was very arrogant to Bette's daughter B.D Heyman who had a small part in the film. When Bette introduced Joan to B.D. the young girl held out her hand to Crawford who looked horrified and swung her hand behind her back as if B.D. were disease and exclaimed, ""Over there are my two youngest twin girls who have been carefully brought up from the wicked side of the world and you obviously my dear have not. I don't want your influence to corrupt them so please stay away from them won't you dear. Bless you"". Bette's jaw dropped to the floor.

 Despite the problems behind-the-scenes ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is a superb film, well-acted and directed and comes with one of the greatest scripts of all-time. It is so nice to have the movie on Blu Ray finally for a whole new generation to enjoy!

 Bonuses will include Davis singing on the ""Andy Williams"" TV show, a rare 1967 interview with Crawford where she discusses both Bette and the film and much more.

 The only new bonus feature that was not included on the DVD set is the beautiful 35-page booklet which features scenes from the film and neat info!!!

 Simply one of my favorite movies that would lead to two other films that were sort of sequels to the original: ""Hush, Hush...Sweet Charlotte"" (1964) and ""Whatever Happened to Aunt Alice? (1969)"".",1341964800,,3391,4.519607843137255

860192,3,6304359721,"This is a tough nut to crack.  Is it a great film?  Is it a classic?  Is it horrendous?  Is it an embarassment for two Oscar winners?

It's all of the above.  It's ghastly.  It's marvelous.  It's grand fun yet sadly opens the door for tarnishing the reputation of both actresses, as after this neither Davis or Crawford ever made it back to the top.  But here they are, crawling over each other in a vain attempt to do so.

I'M A STAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And they'll upstage each other all over the place to prove it to you.  I'm sure it didn't begin this way, but that's how it ended.

This film has gone down in camp history but as what?  A slatternly and drunken Davis and a tied-up Crawford, being served dead birds and rats.  This isn't acting, but a well crafted train wreck.  And Davis and Crawford willingly and happily tied themselves to the tracks.  And here comes the train.  And there they go.

It's not a great film, but a fun one.  Both were financially hungry and so both decided that this was some sort of comeback.

It's an amazing film, to watch two actresses, three Oscars between them, succumb to the Grade B flack that they had fought for years to avoid.  And here they are, in all their glory.  Ruined and wrecked and who would buy a ticket to see this?

All of us.  It earned a fortune.  And the new ladies of horror cashed in on it for the next fifteen years.  Crawford didn't stand a chance, as her reputation was not one of ""great actress"" and wound up in worse than this; she kind of fell by the wayside.  For Davis, it took at least a decade to put this calamity behind her, and even then, she was cast a loon or a horrifying woman. No one took her acting abilities seriously after this anymore.  Shame.

It's a disturbing film, and the suspense is there, but by and large these two Oscar-winners are trapped with a sometimes faulty, gimmicky script.  But Joan does have a great scene on the telephone ""that was the doctor"" and her fear is palpable.  And in several scenes, Davis' performances is unlike anything she had ever attempted before - she can really deliver the shivers here.

SYNOPSIS--  Jane and Blanche Hudson were both stars: Jane in vaudeville as a child, Blanche as an adult in movies. Blanche's screen career ended with a crippling car accident and Jane now cares for her in their Hollywood mansion, where both live as virtual recluses while waging psychological warfare on each other. Blanche is constantly demanding servile attention, while Jane's jealousy and loathing of her are amplified by TV reruns of Blanche's films-- she takes revenge in madly sadistic ways. Blanche grows weaker from starvation and is certain Jane's trying to kill her.

(8.0) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) - Bette Davis/Joan Crawford/Victor Buono/Wesley Addy/Julie Allred/Anne Barton/Marjoroe Bennett/Bert Freed

BABY JANE TRIVIA--

Nepotism: Robert Aldrich's son William plays the beachside lunch counter assistant. Bette Davis's daughter Barbara Merrill is the curious teen next door.

Davis had a COKE machine installed on the set to annoy Crawford, who was on PEPSI's board of directors.

Victor Buono's role (Edwin Flagg) almost went to Peter Lawford.

Shakespearean actor Wesley Addy (Marty McDonald) was married to Celeste Holm.

During the kicking scene, one of Davis's kicks caused a wound in Crawford's head that required stitches to close.

Bert Freed (Ben Golden) originated the TV role of Lt. Colombo, on ""The Chevy Mystery Show,"" in 1960.

The scenes of Jane's early flops are from Davis's ""Ex-Lady"" and ""Parachute Jumper,"" both released in 1933.

Davis and Buono were both nominated for Oscars.",1326844800,,2588,6.548387096774194

860303,5,6304359721,"Well, what did ever happen to Baby Jane (Bette Davis)?  The 50's generation in this film didn't live long enough to remember vaudeville days, the end of which marked the decline of Baby Jane's career as a child entertainer; they wouldn't know the answer to the question.  ""Who the hell was Baby Jane Hudson?"" one of them asks another. So, that said, the answer to this question is:  Total chilling suspense, leaving the viewer to speculate inside the deteriorating walls of a once fashionable Hollywood mansion and witness some haunting hints:  a room buzzer better left alone, a supper tray with ""suspicion"" written all over it, a hammer, a telephone that's looked upon as though it were possessed, forged signatures, a note tossed out of a window, an upstairs room under lock and key, a photo scrawled over with a black marker, and a mysterious voice out of the past.

This film is the first in a string of suspense thrillers Crawford and Davis were cast in.  The classical, romantic genre of the 30's, 40's and 50's was a thing of the past for both women.  They were getting up in years, and the suspense horrors to come, beginning in the 60's, were just the right material for them especially with the way they attacked these later roles with an eerie, Gothic style.

If you're a fan of suspense thrillers, this film is one of the best in that category.  But it's not for the squeamish and faint-hearted.  It is, though, a must-see for fans of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford as it's unlike anything they've done before.

Also, fans of these two Hollywood divas would be delighted with the bonus CD featuring the making of this film, a short clip showing Davis with Andy Williams, and extra footage detailing the lives and careers of both women.  The price is very well worth it!",1293926400,,1781,4.6369426751592355

Jane and Blanche Hudson were both movie stars: Jane in childhood, Blanche as an adult. Blanche's career ended with a crippling car accident and Jane now cares for her in their Hollywood mansion, where both live as virtual recluses. Jane's jealousy and loathing of Blanche are fueled by TV reruns of her sister's films-- she takes revenge in madly sadistic ways. Blanche grows weaker and justifiably more paranoid that Jane is trying to kill her.

BABY JANE TRIVIA--

Nepotism: Robert Aldrich's son William plays the beachside lunch counter assistant. Bette Davis's daughter Barbara Merrill is the curious teen next door.

Davis had a COKE machine installed on the set to annoy Crawford, who was on PEPSI's board of directors.

Victor Buono's role (Edwin Flagg) almost went to Peter Lawford.

Shakespearean actor Wesley Addy (Marty McDonald) was married to Celeste Holm.

During the kicking scene, one of Davis's kicks caused a wound in Crawford's head that required stitches to close.

Bert Freed (Ben Golden) originated the TV role of Lt. Colombo, on ""The Chevy Mystery Show,"" in 1960.

The scenes of Jane's early flops are from Davis's ""Ex-Lady"" and ""Parachute Jumper,"" both released in 1933.

Davis and Buono were both nominated for Oscars.",1291248000,,1955,6.253731343283582

Blanche was more successful than Jane and was still harboring grudges against Jane from childhood. This is definitely a classic movie and the actors were amazing!

860465,5,6304359721,"""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" marked the first movie I'd seen (embarrassingly enough!) by either Bette Davis or Joan Crawford.  It didn't take long for me to learn that the two actresses were supposed to have been bitter rivals in real life and that many people were fans of one or the other but not both. Whether or not the actresses were rivals and whether or not you're a Bette Davis or Joan Crawford fan, this is a movie filled with drama, camp, humor, horror, and suspense!
This is a tale of sibling rivalry between two sisters, Jane (Davis) and Blanche Hudson (Crawford). The movie begins with their childhood, Jane Hudson is the star of the family due to the relentless, if not shameless, promotion by their father.  The beginning sequence of Jane singing ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy,"" at first seems like an overly-long inclusion, but Aldrich (director) is laying down the foundation for Jane's character.  As she sings, Blanche seethes backstage, both jealous of her sister's fame and the attention given to Jane by their father.  Shortly after the show, Jane throws a temper tantrum in front of the same fans that had come to see her, thus prematurely ending her young career.
The movie flashes forward to the sisters as young women, both actresses at this point, but now Blanche is a star in major motion pictures and Jane is a no-talent(and alcoholic!)only buoyed by her sister's success.
The movie flash forwards again to an ""accident"" that causes Blanche to become paralyzed from the waist down. Flash forward once more and it is now ""tomorrow"" or present day (1962) and Jane and Blanche are living together in a deteriorating mansion, and are now in their 50's. This is where the movie really begins to take shape! Blanche's old movies have recently been released to television to her (and her neighbor's) delight, but causes still-fresh feelings of resentment and jealousy in Jane.  At first, Blanche seems content, much like the caged bird she keeps in her room.  However, her caretaker brings to her attention that Jane has been going through her mail, and has started drinking again ""coincidentally"" around the same time Blanche took steps to sell the house.
Bette Davis is sensational as Jane, a garish creation of pancake make-up and tattered baby doll dresses. However, these are the least disturbing things about this character!  With each scene, one can feel Jane's mounting desperation and depravity as she begins to torture Blanche by serving her ""questionable"" entrees, spouting veiled threats, and cutting her off from the outside world.  Joan Crawford wisely pulls back, balancing Davis' histrionics and gives a restrained, deceptively subtle performance.  Upon first viewing, her character is almost unsympathetic.  There's seemingly plenty of opportunities for escape or rescue that aren't taken, leaving the viewer to ask ""why?!"" But upon second viewing, Blanche's actions make more sense and highlights the subtlety of Crawford's performance, which may have not been as apparent in the shadow of Davis' more meaty role and wonderfully bombastic performance.
For me, the most macabre and disturbing part of this movie is when Jane drunkedly sits at the piano and starts singing ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"" and performs it just as she did as a child until she catches sight of herself in the mirror and screams.  It's a sympathetic and condemning moment for Jane: you see that though she is aware of reality, but prefers the safety of her dream, her childhood.  After this point in the movie, her cruelty to Blanche reaches new heights, and one realizes that Jane is not so much mentally ill as she is self-absorbed and desperate.
Jane eventually tries to revive her career with a broke piano player who is happy to ignore her eccentricities and come-ons for the promise of a paycheck.  Buono is great comic relief in a movie that could've felt claustrophobic or heavy-handed otherwise.  Once he comes to realize that there's no paycheck and what's really going on in the house, Jane realizes for the first time that her actions will have consequences and takes Blanche away to the beach for the shocking ending.  I won't spoil it for you, but it'll make you want to see the movie again I promise you!
Everything works in this movie, Aldrich is at the top of his game, the sets and lighting heighten the drama, and all the actors give brilliant performances.  The most powerful thing about this movie though is its statement about the depth of sibling rivalry and its impact on the lives of these two women (or anyone who had a rivalry with a sibling!).  I highly recommend this movie to not just people who like old movies or these great actresses, but to anyone looking to watch a compelling movie that stays with them long after its over!
Also: the special edition of this movie is fantastic! I've seen a lot of old movies adapted to DVD and sometimes the sound and/or picture is poor, but this was transferred masterfully and the extras are a fun watch!",1265587200,,5001,4.857814336075205
860466,5,6304359721,"The first time I saw ""Baby Jane"" I was 14 years old.  I remember being plastered to the seat in the Mayfair Theatre in Hillside, New Jersey.  I had never seen anything like it before.

To this day, I don't think of this film as a ""Horror"" Movie. Oh yes, it's a rough film to watch.  Some of the situations are severe.  The characters may be outragous, but... there isn't the blood and gore I think of as basics in a Horror flick.  Jane was certainly a sick puppy and Blanche wasn't always the poster child for ""Loving Siblings,"" but it may show them as horrible, but not people in a Horror Movie.

In any case, the entire cast shows their professionalism by allowing the director to make them look their worst (and best) and play the parts of bizarre, obviously mentally challenged characters in a very dark film.  It's wonderful!

Everything melds together perfectly... story, cast, support staff, art direction and director.  Perfection in black and white.

Davis ('Baby Jane') was famous as a child vaudeville star; Crawford ('Blanche Hudson') as a movie star now in a wheelchair. Bette is an unbalanced drinker whom Joan Crawford wants to put in a sanitarium. Bette tries to avoid that at all costs. She thinks she is going to revive her 'Baby Jane' act and be famous again. Davis is superb in makeup and adult-sized little girls' dress.  A total classic. Watch for the teenaged girl next door.  It's Bette Davis's real daughter, B.D.

860468,4,6304359721,"I wouldn't call it 'edge of your seat' - it builds quite slowly - and i wouldn't call it 'black comedy' either.  Certainly there are touches of the absurd - well, the whole story is somewhat absurd, but Leonard Maltin's quote on the back of the box ""Thoroughly engaging black comedy"" is way off the mark.  For most people, I don't think a first viewing will yield much in the way of laughs - unless you found movies like ""Misery"" funny.

Another thing that bugged early on in the movie was the fact that while she was trapped in her upstairs room, with her neighbor working in the garden just below - she can throw a note down to her, yet she somehow can't manage to shout to her for help?  There are 2 or 3 scenes like this in the first half of the movie that seem to insult the audiences' intelligence.  Other than that, the movie is interesting for what it is - a showcase of 1962 theatre of the macabre, and the talents of Betty Davis and Joan Crawford.  Filming and acting are fine all around, and the story slowly but surely builds interest and horror until it reaches its memorable and shocking conclusion.  This is a good movie, maybe even a great one for some.  It will hold more interest for the connesseur of old, unusual or even campy movies - not necessarily for the modern movie thrill seeker - for modern thrills in the macabre, check out Dexter. ;)

As for the packaging and treatment of this movie on DVD, you couldn't ask for better.  Disc 2 puts the movie and it's stars into historical perspective with 3 documentaries, behind the scenes featurette, and an Andy Williams Show segment with Betty Davis.  The Betty Davis documentary is substantial at over an hour giving us Davis's life story with many clips from the vast multitude of movies she made and a career that spanned 6 or 7 decades.  Love that it ends with Kim Carnes ""Bette Davis Eyes"". Jody Foster hosts. The second documentary spotlight on Joan Crawford consists of a BBC interview filmed in black and white in the 60s some time after Baby Jane was made.  The interview captures Joan (and the times) as it recounts her filmography and the latest tabloid gossip.  The special features were great and make this edition a real value for money purchase.  It's great to see movies get treatment like this.",1252972800,,2282,4.491525423728813
860469,3,6304359721,"It must be remembered, when comparing this to the original ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"", that the original book by Henry Farrell contained none of the black humour or camp flourishes that made the original film work so well.
Similarly, these things are not present in the remake, and this should not disadvantage it, in itself. The original film, however, created a gothic, melodrmatic style that fitted the storyline. which itself exists in a somewhat heightened reality. While rooted in real psychology, Hollywood tragedy and disillusionment and the plight of invalids who are abused, the story combines and extends these elements. Without the style of the older film, this film seems a little less thrilling, and, in away, believable. The film did not build and Jane's madness did not increase in the same believable way as in the original.
Having said that, however, I thought the updating was well achieved and the alterations to the story appropriate. I enjoyed Blanche's increased tenacity and resistance to Jane's torment as well as the sequences where they get along along and share memories. Jane is not without sympathy and her madness, while not as believable as Davis's, is authentic. Cudos to the Redgrave sisters for their performances.
This film has the look and feel of a TV movie and I think this is due for a full scale remake under the stylistic hand of someone like Tim Burton.",1250899200,,1402,4.970212765957447

860578,5,6304359721,"Being the huge Bette Davis fan that I am, I am totally in love with this movie.  This is far from her finest performance, or her finest film, but you can tell that Davis is right at home inside the crazy eyes of Baby Jane Hudson; and the mere fact that Davis outshone her rival (in more ways than one) Joan Crawford, and even managed to conjure up a Best Actress Oscar nomination above Crawford is another delicious little tidbit that keeps this film resting at the top of my `Davis Favorites'.

The film tells of two sisters who are eternally jealous of one another.  As a young girl Jane Hudson (better known as Baby Jane) was a star.  She sang and danced and had a doll made in her image.  She treated her sister, mother and father terribly, but they put up with it because she was a star.  Her star fell though as she grew and her sister Blanche became the big Hollywood magnate that everyone adored.  When a tragic accident leaves Blanche bound to her wheelchair, Jane becomes her caretaker.  Resentment sets in though, and Jane begins to treat Blanche as if she were a disease.  She is constantly reminded of her own failure when she sees the success and loyal fans that Blanche has now, and as her mind deteriorates she begins to believe that she could regain her old life with the help of Edwin Flagg, a pianist.

Both Davis and Crawford pull out all the stops, playing polar opposites and quite possibly using their own dislike for one another to create a very believable rivalry.  Crawford is very quite and subdued, her inner turmoil surfacing at just the right moments; while Davis is abrasive and outlandish, allowing the quiet moments to come sporadically as she builds her character.  She knows how to let her characters own sanity simmer, showing us rare glimpses of a strange rationality that makes us question her.

Superbly done.

It's funny, since the roles were most likely reversed in the real world, with Crawford being openly jealous of Davis's career.  It just goes to prove that you have to challenge yourself (play against type that is) to really wow an audience.

The film does have a camp appeal to it, so don't be fooled into thinking that this is going to be a genuinely terrifying drama.  Yes, it is not a comedy and it is tense, but you have to be able to embrace the camp in order to truly appreciate it.  The film is very well done and the acting is all very good, especially Davis who understood very well how to craft her character and not merely craft a caricature (she is fearless).  The script is nicely adapted, leaving a mystery for the audience, with a conclusion that is as shocking as it is appropriate.",1238976000,,2648,4.513626834381552
860579,5,6304359721,"This film is profoundly disturbing because of the realism of the situation it portrays-it focuses on the abuse of a disabled adult by a family member, something that rarely gets addressed in our society. In my view, Jane is not insane, but is selfish and self-absorbed, completely focused on her lack of success in adulthood, which makes her completely responsible for her actions, despite the movie's intention to give the impression that Jane is suffering from a mental illness.",1237420800,,480,5.0886075949367084

860581,4,6304359721,"This was a stunning movie in its day!  Of course, it's a bit dated now, but I think it has well stood the test of time.  Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were off-screen rivals who were not too fond of each other anyway.  But, they had never worked together before!  And here for the first time, these two 'silver screen giants' meet, work well together and both deliver stirring, powerful performances of two sisters whose rivalry matched the actresses' real-life squabble.  Closely following Hitchcock's movie 'Psycho', this movie follows along the lines of a similar psychlogical thriller.  Character anaysis of such deeply disturbed people were just not done in those days.  There were good guy and there were bad guys, and that's all there was to it.  Where Psycho tried to explain why Norman Bates was a nut, this movie explores the deterioration of 'Baby Jane' Hudson, played extaordinarily and chillingly well by the talented Ms. Davis.  Fueled by jealousy over her sister's success, resentment over her own failed success as well as her financial dependence on her sister, and guilt over her sister's afliction...coupled with a sense of power she has because of her crippled sister's helplessness...Jane slides deeper into madness, torturing and victimizing her sister Blanche (played with expert precision by Ms. Crawford).  I think Bette held out for the Baby Jane role on purpose, both so she could 'torture' Joan, but also because it was a meatier, heftier role as far as acting ability, the need to slowly descend into madness takes a keen eye and talent by an actress.  And Bette did it very well indeed!  As I said, this movie is a bit dated now, but it has overall stood the test of time.  Davis and Crawford are both supurb in their roles.  The script and pacing were both very good (but very 1962) but still excellent.  I'll spare you the whole plot description, as I'm sure you've seen it in 100 other reviews.  Suffice to say this was an important, shocking movie in its day.  It is still a great movie to watch today...even if Bette isn't serving rats for lunch!",1222041600,,2081,4.784313725490196

I'm not sure if I would want to see Bette Davis's face in colour because she is butt-ugly in this.  Joan Crawford looked kind of ""ill"" in this movie, I don't know what she normally looks like, this was the first movie I've seen with her.  I heard she was a pill popper so maybe that's why she looked weird.  As for the movie, it kept getting better and better.  it starts off slow, and some of the editing was bad so it definately has it's flaws.  I noticed some of the scenes could have been edited by a couple seconds so they didn't drag towards the end.  The scenes with the fat dude were bizarre, the acting was borderline, he kind of annoyed me.  The acting with joan and Bette was incredible, some parts had me laughing because Baby jane really turned into a horrible b!@#$.  I couldn't believe how evil she became, it was hilarious.

860583,4,6304359721,"""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is a dark and disturbing film starring Betty Davis and Joan Crawford. The film centers around two sisters: ""Baby Jane"" and Blanche Hudson. Both were aspiring movie stars whose careers took off in different directions: Blanche became a famous movie star while Jane fell through the cracks as a forgotten child star. A car accident, however, left Blanche crippled and ended her movie career. It was up to Jane, then, to care for Blanche. One day a local television station began airing Blanche's old movies, which leads Jane to flip out...you can guess what happens after that! This movie ranks with ""Misery"" as a frustrating and disturbing film centered around being trapped in a house with a mad woman. Although there is an important twist in the end, you begin to sympathize with Blanche as she is tortured by her jealous sister. This is sibiling rilvary at its best. What's even more important is the real-life rilvary between Davis and Crawford off the screen...and Crawford's real-life madness (remember the movie and book ""Mommie Dearest""?)... Thumbs up!",1219708800,,1094,5.016483516483516
860584,4,6304359721,"Finally a pairing of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford.  It took over 30 years!  Bette Davis got the Nomination, but Joan Crawford made the Announcement at the Academy Awards Ceremony that year, the Award for Best Actress goes to Anne Bancroft for the performance in ""The Miracle Worker""!  Bette never forgave Joan for this, and made life so miserable for Joan during the filming of their next effort, ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" that Joan had to drop from the filming, and was replaced by Olivia de Havilland, who it must be admitted did give a brilliant performance.  Bette even went so far as having everyone on the set drink COCA-COLA instead of Pepsi just to spite Joan, as Joan Crawford was still on the Board of Directors at Pepsi-Cola at that time.  Fortunately, Olivia De Havilland was exceptional in her performance in this follow-up film to ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane"".

A real disappointment is the overlay commentary that accompanies the film on the DVD.  Generally,  This is done with individuals who either were involved in the making of the picture, or a film Historian. UNFORTUNATELY, the two individuals providing the commentary on this DVD, seem to actually know very little about the Film, admitting that it had been years since they had seen it.  The comments are superficial, and oftentimes the commentators admit to not know much about the Film, other that their own remembrances from a viewing many years earlier.  A definite disappointment, as with Film Historians or individuals who REALLY add actual knowledge about the Film could have proven much more interesting.

One of the Stars in this film is actually seeing scenes of the Los Angeles/Hancock Park/Larchmont Village area, as well as the, as well as the original Western Costume Building, Circa 1962.  Much has changed, but the feeling of life in Los Angeles is well remembered in this film.  The subsequent downhill trend in many of these areas, which had been some of the most beautiful areas of the City 30 years earlier.  The MacArthur Park area and the Miracle Mile on Wilshire Boulevard including the Bullocks Wilshire Department Store Building, which is now a College are no longer to be seen or even recognized from what they had been or looked  like just 30 years previously.

MacArthur Park is now crime ridden and no longer a safe part of the City.  At the time of this Film, this Park and the adjacent areas had been one of the most beautiful City Parks of any City in the World.  The  Famous AMBASSADOR HOTEL, home of the World Famous COCOANUT GROVE Night Club, also is in this area and has sadly recently been torn down by City School Board Officials.  The Los Angeles Conservancy fought for over 10 years to save the Hotel because of its' deep rooted History in the City of the Angels, and indeed a very long History in the City of Los Angeles as the Academy Awards were held here at one time.  Probably no other building in the City of Angels has held the History that the AMBASSADOR HOTEL has held, and yet the City and School Board were insensitive to that fact.  DIANE KEATON and many other HOLLYWOOD STARS staged a Protest at the Hotel the night before demolition was to occur, but to no avail.  The City Administrator's of Los Angeles were determined to tear the Hotel down despite the efforts of the Los Angeles Conservancy.  It is indeed good that this film preserves how beautiful Los Angeles once was prior to the current downhill trend, especially in the Wilshire, MacArthur Park and Miracle Mile Districts.

Another Star not generally mentioned is the classic Lincoln Continental Convertible Bette Davis drives during this film.

What else can one say?  This is one of the Great Classic Films of later Hollywood, with two of the Greatest Women Stars ever to come out of Hollywood's long and impressive roster of Actors and Actresses.  Probably the best the World has ever known.

Views of Los Angeles which now are no longer there to be seen, as well as the comfortable nature of the City is sadly long gone.  This film does preserve this wonderful period of time in Los Angeles that no no longer exists.",1218672000,,4117,4.73352033660589

860650,1,6304359721,"This movie, a TV-remake of a B movie, is pathetic.  The underlying concept of a child star being eclipsed by her sister in adulthood is something worth fleshing out.  Stunning successes in childhood followed by a dramatic fall from grace in adulthood is hard to come to terms with.  Jane's basic resentment is understandable, but the movie -- particularly Lynn Redgrave's ridiculous portrayal of a woman that would have been institutionalized and not around to torment her sister makes it embarrassing to watch.  Still, Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of resignation and desparation -- and forgiveness -- is wonderfully performed.  She is reduced, for much of the movie, to expressing herself through her eyes.  Those incredibly expressive eyes bring to mind her role in ""Wetherby.""

Although Vanessa Redgrave's character, Blanche, has a British accent (she sounds like Vanessa Redgrave), Lynn Redgrave's character, Jane, has an attempt at an American accent that is hilariously awful.  She moves across several states within one sentence, exaggerating her ""r""s, particularly.  This discrepancy is doubly puzzling given that both the characters and the Redgraves are sisters.

The Redgraves and their characters' relationship give this movie tremendous potential, but it is horribly executed.  Only Vanessa Redgrave is saved here.  She did a great job with what and whom she had to work with.",1200096000,,1389,5.409302325581395
860651,5,6304359721,"Robert Aldrich's 1962 Movie Masterpiece, ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is one of my all time favorite films and one of the visionary staples of my youth. I have long admired the ""larger than life"" glamour and  cinematic greatness of Movie Legends Bette Davis b. Ruth Elizabeth Davis, (1908-1989) and Joan Crawford b. Lucille Faye LeSueur, (1904-1977) and this  superbly acted, well-crafted film justifies and further cements that appreciation.
In short, the film is about an embittered, neurotic has-been vaudevillian child-star and actress, and the psychological reign of terror that she exerts over her crippled 1930's Movie-Queen sister. It's about intense and unhealthy sibling rivalry, family dysfunction, jealously, guilt, neurosis, substance abuse and the ""dark side"" of Hollywood Fame.
This film is visually stunning!  Shot in glorious black and white, the film opens with a day in the life (circa 1917) of child star Baby Jane Hudson, a beautiful little girl with an Angelic singing voice and loads of charisma.  Not only is Jane Hudson the ""star headliner"" of the Vaudevillian Circuit, but she's the breadwinner of her family as well, which consists of her brow-beaten, care-worn mother, her sychophant milquetoast of a father, and her sister Blanche, a dour, freckled faced child with pigtails and large, soulful eyes.
In these opening sequences, the viewer can see how early family dynamics contributed to the development of the sisters, their adversarial relationship with one another, and the origin of the dysfunction that facilitated the conditions for the horror to come.
The year is 1935, the girls are now beautiful young women, and Blanche Hudson is one of the most successful stars in movies, by comparison, Jane's star has faded, and she is now relegated to minor roles in ""B-movies"".  Jane's wild, self-destructive lifestyle, fueled by her burgeoning alcoholism, is beginning to render her unreliable and unemployable by the studio system.
Although Blanche is now the ""favored"" sister, a tragic turn of events occur that serves to alter her life's course and that of her sister Jane, as well. The montage of events filmed by Director Aldrich to depict ""the accident"" is a touch of genius.  I mean everything from the stylish luxury car of the time, the costumes, and the music come together to imprint an indeliable impression on the mind of the viewer. There's a shot of an elegantly bejewled shoe on a dainty foot releasing the clutch, a graceful manicured hand shifting the gears of the car, and the rev of the engine and the crash of the car into the gates after almost running over a woman resplendently gowned in evening wear.  A woman screams, then there are sobs in the night, cut to a shot of the car's exhaust, then the life-sized Baby Jane Doll lying on the pavement, her beauty marred by the immense fracture in her head, in a symbolic presentiment of the events to come, revealing the dark chasm of future madness within. Viewing this scene as a child always terrified me, especially with the enigmatic question, the words seeming to eerily come directly out of that doll's head, accompanied by Frank DeVol's thunderous, bombastic score:  ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?""
And that's just the beginning of the film!

This film revived the careers of both Davis and Crawford, who were considered ""past their prime"" as it was politely said in the vernacular of the day.  In fact, this film was a box office success in its initial release, and Davis received her fifth Academy Award nomination for her disturbingly dynamic portrayal of the yowling, grotesque and murderous Baby Jane.  This groundbreaking film (along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) also helped to give birth to a new genre of film, the psychological thriller.  This film  boasts a fine cast and includes such luminaries of the day as Marjorie Bennett, Anna Lee, Julie Allred, character actress Maidie Norman, in a scene-stealing turn as the fiesty ""cleaning lady"" Elvira Stitt, and it also launched the career of  Victor Buono.
I can't say enough about how well this movie was made. Aldrich directs in a style that's very visual, in the tradition of directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, John Carpenter, Steven Speilberg and later, James Cameron. The cinematography for this film is excellent and is highly compatible with DeVol's dramatic, atmospheric and haunting score.  I love this movie, and it's difficult to envision anyone else other than Bette Davis and Joan Crawford playing the Famed Hudson Sisters.  I read the Novel by Henry Farrell when I was in High School, and I can earnestly say that the screenplay was very faithful to the source material.  This DVD also contains two featurettes, one about Bette Davis and hosted by Jodie Foster, the other about Joan Crawford, and a ""Anatomy of a Scene"" featurette consisting of ""on location"" footage filmed in 1962.

Davis is particularly horrible looking, with heavy white pancake makeup, and  painted on lips and creepy eyebrows. Her cackling laugh and voice are very disarming as well.

Crawford plays the invalid with much pathos. Both women portray what can happen to any of us in life. The sad decline of these women into a very weird  life style is a great psychological horror story, that is both fascinating and disturbing.

860656,5,6304359721,"n an unforgettable film, Bette Davis portrays Baby Jane, a drunken, slovenly former child star brilliantly.

Baby Jane Hudson,Bette Davis' character had been an adored child singer and dancer. blond curls, frilly dresses, she is also daddy's favorite.

Her pretty dark haired sister Blanche watched with some envy as Baby Jane sang and curtsied before a wildly applauding audience.

Crawford plays sister Blanche Hudson, a talented actress who achieved enormous success as a talented film star, while sister Jane's former appeal is lost after childhood.

Kindly Blanche refuses offers in film unless Jane is also given a role. Jane's poor acting skills limit her from being in big demand.
The roles are reversed, Jane now envies Blanche.

Tragedy occurs one night in a car crash with the sisters leaving Blanche paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair.

This is where madness and irony set in.

Aging Jane boozes through the days caring for her sister and becoming more and more reckless.

Delusional and demented Jane decides to dust off her career as a ten year old singing sensation. She must practice, it has been at least sixty years since she'd last danced to that role of America's little sweetheart.

Spending money like mad she has original ""little girl"" costumes made up. She rehearses her old songs and even hires a pianist to accompany her singing. Neglected Blanche, sick and helpless in bed upstairs listens to the singing of Jane and Edwin.

Bette Davis keeps the suspense going as she descends into alcohol and madness and you don't even want to blink an eye in the anticipation of this great film.

Long since, a cult classic and the single movie in which the two mega stars appear together.

The rat on the plate for dinner was a scream (no pun intended)!

What was a surprise was Bette Davis singing her song of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" on the Andy Williams Show.  Of course this was way before my time, but I had to chuckle when I saw her doing the Twist ... or whatever ... to the music, which by the way, was rock 'n roll!

860763,5,6304359721,"The last great picture Joan Crawford ever did ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" is simply a classic and the 2 disc DVD is a must own!. Released in 1962 and nominated for multiple Oscars including one for Best Actress for Bette Davis, the film has gone down in movie history as the best in the Grand Guinol genre. More than a horror film the picture depicts the hatred between 2 sisters over many years, ultimately climaxing in an exciting finale. Joan Crawford is simply amazing as the helpless sister being harrased by her unbalanced sister played to perfection by Davis. It's quite a change for Crawford after playing evil women roles and Crawford pulls it off. You can't help but love both leading ladies in these parts. Crawford should have been nominated for an Oscar as well but was overlooked. Wonderful direction by Robert Aldrich, the movie also has a wonderful Supporting cast. The script is perfect and like the trailer says you have never seen Crawford or Davis in anything like this before. The movie also spawned the television movie of the same name in 1991 directed by Aldrich's son William starring Vannessa and Lynn Redgrave. It would be nice if this movie was put out on DVD because it too has become a classic and a hard to find film. Also knowing how much Crawford and Davis hated each other in real life makes watching this film that more enjoyable. They were also both to star in another film 2 years later but Crawford was let go because she was too ill.
 The DVD set of the film is splendid. Picture and audio are prefect and the dics come with a slew of bonus features including the trailer, Bette singing the title song on the ""Andy Williams"" TV show the month after the film came out, and I think the crowning jewel in the set is a rare interview of Joan Crawford from British TV talking about the picture.

The gorgeous black & white photography gets its due on this two-disc DVD, which features a sharp, clean print of the film and a variety of notewothy extras on the second disc, some produced for the DVD and some drawn from cable programming.  In particular, a 44 minute or so retrospective on Ms. Davis' career, hosted by a radiantly dressed Jodie Foster, is worth one's time.  Laced with film clips, numerous moments from Ms. Davis' many appearances on TV talk shows and interview programs in the 70's and 80's, and lots of poster art, this candid but ultimately admiring look at this great actress is a great companion piece to the film, which the retrospective spends a generous amount of time discussing.  One caveat: The Jodie Foster piece also cites many examples of the many ""routine, mundane"" films Ms. Davis was forced to make while under contract at Warner Brothers, but I think many of those films (""Marked Woman"", for example) are actually pretty good.  Oh, well-- to each his own.

Special features about Joan Crawford and an anecdote-laced commentary track are also included in this generous package.  I really enjoyed spending a couple of evenings with this DVD and I think you will, too.",1191974400,,1608,4.99625468164794

Jane was once a cutesy childhood performer, groomed and dresed up like a little doll. Like Shirely Temple, her performances probably made pedophiles grin. An embittered, nasty woman who never quite grew up past being a spoiled child, Jane is eager for any audience. Bette Davis really nails the part of Jane, as viewers are given no choice but to simply HATE her character. She really steals the show. Crawford is also very good too, as viewers feel pity for her, hoping she'll make it in the end. The ending is ambiguous.

I mean this was a time when the ""b"" word and terms like ""bunny boiler"" were yet to enter proper English conversation... and America was supposed to be a safe happy place... enter Bette Davis in the role she was born to play - - a wicked witch of the witch of the west out to carrying sibling rivalry to an extreme as scene by scene her cruelty and ""campy"" behaviour show no ends - - and even though there is almost no graphic violence, this is definitely one film that will mess with your mind and make you squirm....  ""macabre"" is an understatement.  - - on the other hand, Bette Davis is so over the top, the film is just as funny as it is horrifying.  The only downside of this film is you'll probably never want to eat poultry again -- ouch!

860859,5,6304359721,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" opened the floodgates for low-budget black-and-white psychological shockers in the early 1960s. William Castle's ""Homicidal"", Hammer Films' ""Paranoiac"" and ""Nightmare"", and Francis Ford Coppola's ""Dementia 13"" were just a few of these gritty and grisly films. Robert Aldrich, known for making rather macho films such as ""Kiss Me Deadly"", decided to produce a film based on Henry Farrell's book ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" and had a gimmick of his own that gave Hitchcock and Castle a run for their money: he cast 2 legendary Oscar-winning actresses whose ""glory days"" were, for the most part, behind them...Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Davis' and Crawford's careers had fallen on hard times, and the two, to put it mildly, detested each other. Who better to play a crippled, former glamourous movie star and her sister, an alcoholic, demented, former vaudeville child star? Miss Davis gives one of her most outrageous performances as Baby Jane Hudson, chewing the scenery with relish and looking almost unbearably ugly (Miss Davis, in her own words, ""Laid the makeup on with a shovel""), wears unflattering, grotesque outfits (deliberately made a half-size too small to emphasize her dumpy figure) and a blonde Mary Pickford-style wig, which, unknown to her, had been worn by Miss Crawford in one of her early MGM films! Miss Crawford plays her role of Blanche Hudson with equal gusto, suffering and emoting grandly, as if her very life depended on it. This is a grande dame battle royale, there's no mistaking it!  ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" became a smash hit, garnered Davis an Oscar nomination, and launched a new trend of films which starred older actresses in a variety of low-budget shockers. DeHavilland, Stanwyck, Fontaine, and Tallulah Bankhead all went the ""horror hag"" route. Warner Brothers has reissued ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" in a special 2-disc edition, and is a real treat for Davis and Crawford fans. The film itself looks wonderful, with excellent picture and sound quality. The extras? They are a-plenty, tho THIS hag wishes there had been even more! A new documentary entitled ""Bette and Joan: Blind Ambition"", features interviews with various film scholars and biographers, including the brilliant drag artiste/playwright John ""Lypsinka"" Epperson, and actor/playwright Charles Busch. The other features include the Turner documentary ""All About Bette"", hosted by Jodie Foster; a segment from ""The Andy Williams Show"" featuring Miss Davis singing ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" (in which she looks like female impersonator Charles Pierce!); ""Star Profile: Joan Crawford"", an interview for British TV filmed at the time Miss Crawford was filming ""Berserk!""; and a short feature entitled ""Behind the scenes of Baby Jane"", made during the filming. Also on the DVD is an audio commentary by Mr Epperson and Mr. Busch, who provide a lot of witty and interesting anecdotes concerning the film. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were larger-than-life ladies who had long careers in a male-dominated industry. They had drive, talent, and b***s. And so, my hat's off to both of them, they should be happy to know that they're still famous, and people are still watching their movies and getting immense enjoyment from them...and that's not even including the ""straight"" people!",1151539200,,3340,5.290018832391714

But it is unforgivable that Warners has used two commentators whose ONLY qualification to comment on this film appears to be that their flaming queens.

They don't know who Dave Willock is (he plays the sisters' father) except to know he was on TV a lot.  (Gee, couldn't they look it up?)  They do not seem to know ANY inside stories or Hollywood history connected with the stars or the film production.

This is a great disservice.  Warners should have hired either people who knew the stars or who took part in the production, or real reviewers, like most classic DVDs have, or a combination of the two.  At least a serious student of the movie who actually did some research would be infinitely better that these 2 birds.

860920,5,6304359721,"Why doesn't Hollywood make movies like this anymore? ""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"" stars Bette Davis as former child star Jane Hudson and Joan Crawford as Jane's crippled sister, Blanche. Like her sister, Blanche also had a career in Hollywood, and she ended up becoming much more successful than Jane. Now that Blanche is confined to a wheelchair, she must rely on Jane to take care of her. Jane is also dependent on her sister, though, because both women are living off of the money Blanche earned from her film career. Unfortunately for both sisters, Jane has slowly been losing her mind and the bitterness that she has always felt towards Blanche finally escalates. Jane manages to sever all of Blanche's ties to the outside world by forcing her to remain in an upstairs bedroom, unable to use the telephone or have any contact with other people.

Eventually Jane starts serving Blanche dead birds and rats for dinner and becomes physically violent. In addition to holding her sister hostage, Jane is busy with her absurd and pathetic effort to revive her childhood career, complete with a curly-haired wig and girlish dance routine. Blanche resorts to drastic measures to get help, which pushes Jane over the edge. The sisters' maid finally figures out what's been going on, but unfortunately for her, Jane sneaks up behind her before the police are called. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, but the final scene with Jane holding two strawberry ice cream cones while dancing on the beach is something you'll NEVER forget!

This film is a great example of a brilliant psychological horror story. Both of the leading actresses are superb in their roles, but this movie is all about Bette Davis. Her portrayal of a drunken psychopathic nutcase suffering from multiple personalities AND a ""daddy's little girl"" complex is truly horrifying.

860922,5,6304359721,"Long time rivals, Bette and Joan, may have been less than cordial to each other in real life, but they made a spectacular horror film. I do not see this in any way as a comedy, black or otherwise, it is far too dark for that designation...it is a genuine horror movie and Joan and Bette prove their respective merits in this one. I saw this when it first came out, and marveled at the fabulous acting and atmosphere throughout. You are naturally, at first, entirely on Joan's side; it is she who suffers the tortures of Tantulus at the hands of her malevolent sister, Bette. Imprisoned in her own home, and it really is hers, her money, her former stardom that pays for everything, a reality that further enrages and inflames the already overflowing hatred raging in Bette and dooms Joan. It isn't until the last minutes of the movie that we finally find out the real circumstances of this tragic pair and how it came to be. You are on the edge of your seat for most of the movie, rooting for Joan and there is not one minute of slack or tedium, all is pertinent and achingly suspenseful. Bette's daughter (during her pre-Mommy Dearest angst) B.D., plays the daughter of the next door neighbor who worships Joan but is not allowed to see her favorite movie star. Another reason for the reality of this movie is, you can believe it absolutely, it is entirely plausible for this to really happen, and it seems so very real, filmed in black and white, almost a documentary. When Bette tries a comeback she appers, grotesquely, in her childhood costume of Baby Jane, and this is the most horrifying shot you will ever see of Ms Davis; her heavily made-up face, combined with the singing of her childhood song ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"" will give you nightmares for days to come. Two sisters, one neglected and the other the breadwinner and the star in the spotlight...a recipe for murderous sibling rivalry without doubt. If you haven't seen this, you're in for a treat; if it's been many years, see it again, but whatever your circumstances, see it...they don't make them like this any more; simply no stars today who have the charisma of Bette and Joan, two unique and fascinating stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Maybe because the two unique performance artists did not record their comments together.

The book, a full and glorious account of the fractious relationship between the two stars, on and off the screen, for thirty years, wasn't used.  Why? Perhaps because Warner Video adhere to the same lack of creative perspective and passion for money that its founder Jack Warner displayed when asked to finance ""Baby Jane.""

Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) - The legendary dispute between rival divas Bette Davis and Joan Crawford fuelled the fire both on- and off-screen in Director Robert Aldrich's Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? Its Grand Guignol story of an aging ex-vaudeville child star (Davis) waging a psychotic reign of terror over her crippled ex-movie star sister (Crawford) became a smash hit and nabbed Davis her 10th Academy Award nomination for her acid portrayal of the title role. Nominated for an impressive five Academy Awards (winning for Best Costume Design), Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? is a mirthful masterpiece of the macabre.

Bette Davis is excellent as the fractured adult incarnation of the spoilt brat child star, Baby Jane Hudson.  Joan Crawford was brilliant as the tragic, wheelchair bound actress and older sister, Blanche Hudson.

I purchased it, sat through it and enjoyed every minute of film to the final scene, which I never expected.

861008,5,6304359721,"""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?"" is (perhaps) Joan's very best picture.

Joan plays crippled Blanche Hudson who is looked after by her mentally unstable sister Jane (played by the legend, Bette Davis). Blanche was a very successful actress from the 30's, while Jane was a child star.

Jane was always jealous of Blanche's later successes and never let her forget it. It gets especially bad for Blanche when a local TV network starts repeating her old pictures, this incites crazy Jane. The kook even tries to feed her poor sister her pet parakeet!

The movie is very suspenseful, and climactic in many parts. It's also somewhat sad and shocking.

Never one to play second fiddle to anyone (even Ms. Davis), Joan totally manages to steal the spotlight in this classic picture! Blanche was so beautiful, and sympathetic towards her nutty sister. Perhaps a better title would have been, ""What Ever Happened To Blanche?""

This was Joan's comeback picture of the 60's. She really needed this picture, otherwise why else would she have made a picture with Bette Davis taking second billing!

This is a classic 1960's film that anyone who likes good cinema will surely appreciate.",1142899200,,1175,4.939086294416244

The movie is still a great classic and the most amazing thing about it is Bette Davis' performance.

She acts without any personal vanity as she becomes the old, grotesque and, ultimately, demented Baby Jane.

Her singing and dancing makes one wince, but you cannot look away.

It is one of the bravest performances of the decade.

She lost the Oscar race that year to Anne Bamcroft in The Miracle Worker.

Joan Crawford is effective in a less showy role.

Victor Buono shines brightly in his film debut.

This was the beginning of a number of macabre movies featuring Bette, Joan, and others including Straight Jacket, Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte, and Lady In A Cage.

861010,5,6304359721,"Although this film was released in 1962 (albeit to critical and popular acclaim), it still retains its quality given its dark human themes of sibling rivalry, psychological terror and dementia, and outright sadism and masochism. It is an outstanding film in every right.

Bette Davis (Jane Hudson) and Joan Crawford (Blanche Hudson) play elder sisters who, as children growing up into adulthood, develop a bitter and cruel rivalry that puts Blanche in the care of Jane who is anything but a true care-giver. Despite her hey-days as a successful 1930's movie star (some 25 years earlier), Blanche has been reduced to a wheel-chair invalid (owing to a hit-and-run accident involving Jane of course) and becomes dependent on Jane for her everyday needs. Jane, a vaudeville-era child star who becomes a 1930's film actress failure and is largely forgotten, ends up financially desperate in her old age, and has no alternative but to live with Blanche who provides them both a decent living in a physically decayed mansion. What results for Blanche is a tormented life that is a series of insults and pain methodically inflicted by Jane who has, over the years, become insane due to her well-nursed hatred for her sister. Jane is clearly the aggressor in this sick relationship, and her ugliness even manifests itself in physical terms as she struggles to re-capture her long-lost days as a vaudeville star with the aid of Victor Buono's Edwin (picture an old haggard woman dolled up with inch-thick lip-stick, make-up, and a wig).

Bette Davis plays Jane with such well-restrained and uncontrollable ferocity that you witness her deep psychosis with self-serving yet unsympathetic shock. Her performance is so over the top that you become immersed with the grotesque nature of her pathetic character, who is quite reminiscent of Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. Joan Crawford portrays Blanche with such genuine helplessness that you feel her life unravel as Jane starves, beats, and denies her all human comfort. Although Blanche is a victim, we learn at the film's shocking end why Blanche became resigned to her savage treatment, and this revelation explains her half-hearted effort to defend herself against Jane's onslaught. In this vein, Crawford's performance is intentionally un-empowering and counters Davis's no-holds barred portrayal. It is this combination that brings out the worst of Blanche and Jane, and there is no chance of redemption here for either.

The film's technical composition facilitates the emotional intensity the story demands. Filmed in black and white, the film's presentation lucidly captures the bizarre nature of Jane and Blanche and the events that drive them toward sickening madness. The use of a colorized format would have overwhelmed the senses which are already absorbed with a dark story and a lurid set of characters. Just take a look at the colorized images of the DVD's menu selections and you'll understand.

This movie clearly possesses excellent direction and plot, extraordinary character actors and  production values, and an ending scene that will haunt you. It deserves five stars !!",1140652800,,3151,5.244047619047619

Then that faithful day occured when things just did not go Baby Janes way and her spoiled brat triade seen by all her admiring fans blowing forever that sweet lovable all amercian blonde haired blue eyed child next store image her spin doctor father had cultivated over many years.

Well we fast foward a good quarter century to find much has changed.  Baby Jane Hudson eons 25 years later is eons distant from the fawnish flawless youthful homespun innocent angelic beauty she was in kinder days long past.  Baby Jane Hudson has aged becoming a tired haggerd neurotic incrediablely ugly lush with a persistant hope of rekindling morally decayed embers of her childhood stardom now BITTERLY COLD and forgotten.  If what I have just shared was all that happened in this movie it would be a keeper but there is so very much more here to explore and I'll NOT be a spoiler by telling all to the likes of you on this website.

This movie comes close as you can to playing with real fire for co-staring with Bete Davis was her real life foe Joan Crawford.  You see Bete Davis fancied herself among the working class common folk.  Bette D. was an ""Actress"" earning her money like regualr folk did, her movie career was her JOB!  Where in contrast Joan Crawford saw herself as Movie Star Royality who had to be accorded the appropriate deference at all time by all in attendance when and wherever she held court. And remember hang nothing on ""Wire Hangers EVER!!!!!""  ANYAWAYS Let me tell you these two sista's hated its other down to the raw stem cell  filled bone marrow but at the time Whatever Happened To Baby Jane was made both stars careers had hit the skids and BOTH needed the money bad and were too professional to allow themselves to not take the respective roles.

Neither of their respective roles in this film made Bete or Joan look glamourous or saintly.  Bette Davis had to wear horrible horse face makeup and be a really ugly played out dried up totally crazy has been shrew named Baby Jane Hudson.  The movie's Baby Jane Makeup dude got an Oscar Nod and trust me as you will see if you buy this movie he earned bit of it.  Joan C. had to play Blanche Husdon a vindictive scheming faded hollywood former leading lady sex pot vixen living in her breif movie star past she too hoped to restart.  Blanche Hudson's grasping saddistic self destructive inner demons punished her in ways most cruel for crimes most foul in her more rcent past leaving her a wheelchair-bound still beautiful shell slowly rotting from within.  Blanche lives in step with the twisted psychotic whims  of her ambulitory sister Baby Jane Hudsons whose mentally ill tender mercies exact a horrible toll.  Together these two totally crazy sister babes end up sharing this big dark old spooky mansion the moldy faded raggity residue of long gone better times for both.  The house has become an insane assylum in miniture with its two equally pathetic sprung out inhabitants feeding off each others twisted guilt ridden multi-faceted insanities.

Whatever Happened To Baby Jane is in effect a story about two sisters locked in a no holds barred race to a shared mad house and all bets are off as to which of these deliciously twisted competitors will get to the finish line first.  I won't give away the ending but I will just tell you there is no true winner at the end of the picture. If however you must have closure watching this marvel of near perfect weirdness your winner will be taking her victory laps while holding two ice cream cones look for it this will be it will be your coveted tragic moment come to a very final call.

Norma Desmond just wanted a close up from Mr DeMille, Baby Jane just wanted some ice cream both got to serve time with the clay ashtray and bunny wrabbit set enjoying.  I can imagine Norma Desmond of Sunset Boulevard and Baby Jane Hudsom meeting in a mental hospital for dried up crazy stars as each is led away screaming, both caught in the loving embrace of that special medication with the extra long sleeves that tie in the back.

Like Sunset Boulevard, Whatever Happened to Baby Jane too is a DVD I did not mind buying in the least and would buy it again in a heart beat as it was worth every cent I paid AMAZON.COM.

If you love twisted horror movies from the 40's 50's back when most of the special effects gore in a horror movie went on in your imagination as you filled in the blanks in using your brain this movie is so for you.  If you like horror that makes you think rather than just watch then What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is your movie.  This is a horror movie that will stay with you and become part of your everyday life because, some experience will always remind you of this movie.  This movie looks under the rocks buried and forgotten in the deepest reaches of peoples souls.  You will likely remember two lines from this movie forever... ""Blanche you know we have rats in the cellar"" and the place where Blanche hollers, ""JANE YOU WOULD NOT DO THIS TO ME IF I WERE NOT IN THIS CHAIR!... to which Baby Jane retorts snidly, :BUT YOU ARE BLANCHE YOU ARE IN THAT CHAIR!""

Finally I did a bit of research and found out in the scene where Blanche falls down the steps and is discovered at the base of the steps by Baby Jane returning home the script called for Baby Jane to kick Blanche Hudson <Joan Crawford> for trying to summon some to rescue her from Baby Jane Hudsons LOVING CARE!  Well Bette Davis kicked Blanche <Joan Crawford> alright not pulling the kicks as she was supposed to.  Joan Crawford ended up going to the hospital and suffered real and painful fractured ribs from the kicking Bete Davis gave her showing how just genuine and deep the hatred in these two DIVA's of the old time cinema was in real life.

861091,4,6304359721,"Sibling rivalry a la Grand Guignol by way of SUNSET BLVD., this is Robert Aldrich's creepy take on what happens to two aging sisters, former Hollywood stars who now live together, corrosively codependent.  At its 1964 release, much was made of the longtime ""feud"" between aging divas Davis and Crawford.  Several scenes of sadomasochism play off this mostly media-manufactured competition; eg. Davis (as former child star Baby Jane Hudson) brutally kicking a crippled Crawford around the floor of their dark, drapes-drawn parlor.  True to the story, both Davis and Crawford allow themselves to be seen in anything but Hollywood glamour shots: they forego vanity to achieve power.  Bitter, alcoholic Davis achieves a level of grotesquerie rarely portrayed on the big screen by ""name"" actresses of the era.  Fourteen years after Billy Wilder's SUNSET BLVD.(1950), Robert Aldrich's film is not of the artistic calibre of Wilder's SUNSET which could just as easily have taken the title ""Whatever Happened to Norma Desmond?""
This Davis/Crawford pairing engendered something of a sub-genre of has-beens returning to the screen as psychopathic killers, great film actresses having to play perhaps the only parts they were offered (HUSH, HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE; WHO SLEW AUNTIE ROO?, etc.)  Special commentary on DVD would have been nice.",1124582400,,1329,5.396135265700483
861092,5,6304359721,"Wow. This a fantastic terrifying film. As a little girl Baby Jane was a popular singing and dancing act on Vaudeville, but when she grew up her sister Blanche became the star, a very popular movie actress and Jane's movies were flops. Then a drunken Jane drives her car into Blanche which leaves her paralysed for life. Then about thirty years later the story continues with Blanche and Jane living together in the same house. Blanche has been conffined to her room and Jane is supposed to bring up food for her. But Jane has been drinking a lot lately and has been acting very hostile. She finds out Blanche wants to move out of the house and bring Jane to a doctor because of her alcoholism and hostility. But Jane plans to keep Blanche in her room and start her act up again, as she still thinks of herself as a little girl instead of an overweight, ugly, middle-aged lady.

Jane and Blanche are played by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, who actually hated eachother in real life, and they both give fantastic performances, Davis as the terrifying, insane, hideous Jane who gives her sister rats for lunch and acts extremely erratically, and Crawford as the incresingly afraid Blanche, unable to find a way out.

The film is extremely suspenseful and terrifying. Recommended.",1123545600,,1277,4.696428571428571
861093,4,6304359721,"It is rare, in Hollywood, that an actress is allowed to resurrect her career, much less do it twice! Bette Davis was a has-been actress (albeit an Academy Award winning one) when she took the role of Jane Hudson, an alcoholic has-been child star. She'd been the biggest box office draw in history, then she torpedoed her own career protesting her bosses at Warner Brothers. In the early 50's she resurrected her career with ""All About Eve"", but that resurrection was short lived. It was with ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?"" that Davis saw a completely new career come into being. The last thirty years of her life saw her at her most prolific, if not always memorable, performances.

That the producers managed to lure Davis' greatest silver screen competition - Joan Crawford - was a coup of unimaginable magnitude!

The two actresses not only didn't get along - they HATED each other! They had always been each other's competition and now they were cast in a film where they were each competing for screen time. According to Davis, Crawford was overly vain and unwilling to concede her vanity for the sake of the film. See what you think for yourself. I tend to agree with Davis.

Director Robert Aldrich took screenwriter Lukas Heller's adaptation of Henry Farrell's novel and turned it into the sleeper hit of 1962! The screen fairly cracks with energy as these two silver screen divas create star making turns in front of the camera.

If Davis hadn't already been a star of disproportionately stellar magnitude, she surely would have after the release of this film. While Crawford displays an extremely palpable fear in this film, it is Davis who manages to steal the film.

Jane Hudson (Davis), formerly a phenomenal vaudevillian child star, and her crippled sister, Blanche live together in a Los Angeles home that was bought by their father using Jane's profits. Jane's career, like so many child stars, disappeared as she aged. Much to her chagrin, Blanche became a wildly popular film actress. But now Blanche is crippled and her career is over. It is a bittersweet victory for Jane, because she must take care of her sister. But Jane has plans...Jane is going to ressurrect her vaudeville career. She is lining up an accompaniest to assist her and there's nothing that Blanche can do about it....

So why does Blanche live with Jane?

Why is Jane nuttier than ten fruitcakes?

Why is Blanche crippled?

Why does Jane treat Blanche so cruelly?

All of these questions are answered in this stupendous pot boiler thriller. It is Grande Guiginol cinema without the gore!

In her autobiography, Davis recounted how she insisted upon doing her own makeup. She said the inital dailies showed her looking too normal. She wanted to go for a woman completely out of her mind. So she caked on the makeup. When she saw the new dailies, she cried, because she looked so horrible.

No matter. Because of this film, Davis' career began to sky rocket for an entirely new generation of theater goers. Kids who'd not known her in her prime were going to fall in love with this one of a kind actress through ""Baby Jane"" and her subsequent performances in ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"", ""The Nanny"", and ""Dead Ringer.""

There are so many quotable lines from this film that it is hard to peel them apart, but I managed to get out my favorite in the title of this review. Watch this film and see if you don't absolutley love it!

861137,5,6304359721,"This movie was funny as hell although full of suspense. A story about an aged child star who has become resentful at the progress & attention her older sister & only sibling has received by Hollywood as an up an coming actress, as the 2 are growing up. Baby Jane Hudson, played by Betty Davis, was always used to getting her way as a child actress. Kind of like puts you in the mind of the worldwide acclaim Shirley Temple received for being such a young, talented entertainer, but unlike Temple, as Baby Jane began to grow up, her talent fizzled and she was no longer in demand. A true daddy's little girl, her and her father shared a very close relationship as he had a hand in her career, and treated his other daughter, Blanche Hudson, coldly. After their parents passed away, Blanche became an actress, a more mature actress & took Hollywood by storm, but her career was abruptly halted by a car accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down and left her in a wheel chair. With no other relatives to care for her, she and Baby Jane ended up living together, with Blanche, though older, forced to have the resentful & sassy Jane take care of her. This is where the story becomes funny as hell. Betty Davis was hilarious in her actions, sabotaging things in the house, creating dangerous dishes for her older sister, knowing Blanche couldn't cook for herself. Jane even made it impossible for Blanche to get outside assistance ( i.e from neighbors, doctors, etc ). You will find yourself on the edge of you seat, wondering just what the hell this crazy lunatic ( Baby Jane ) was going to do to her invalid sister next. The highlight to me, was Jane's attire once she got old. She tried to retain her childhood appearance even over the age of 60, I'm talking ring curls, bows, & baby-doll dresses, which in some way, would freak some people out, especially with her heavy clown makeup she wore, which she over-did it on. Though the title of the movie will leave some wondering, it ends up being very fitting because it leaves you actually wondering ""just what the hell DID happen to Baby Jane"" to make her turn out so evil and crazy. Joan Crawford as Blanche, also did a good job, playing the punk sister who can't stand up for herself, afraid to eat her dinner and what not. This was a classic.

Guilt-ridden sixty something Baby Jane Hudson, with two pounds of facial make-up is mentally trapped in a vindictive childhood while Blanche. Her crippled sister, relies on Jane for life support. This is a riveting psychological thriller except for the very last uncharacteristically weak scene. Prepare to be terrorized in many ways -- all eminating from the direction of Baby Jane Hudson.

Needless to say, ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is everything you've heard and more. People went back and forth, frothing at the mouth in anticipation of a Freddy Krueger versus Jason Voorhees duel in ""Freddy vs. Jason,"" but if you want the real deal all you need do is check out Joan Crawford versus Bette Davis. By all accounts sworn enemies in real life, ""Baby Jane"" finally brought the two powerhouses together for a knock down, drag out fight of epic proportions in a movie that is so utterly insane it really does defy description. Every thing I will write about the film below won't do it justice. I imagine this movie is a lot like the Taj Mahal or the Grand Canyon--you can look at pictures and say ""Wow! That looks incredible,"" but a two dimensional photographic image won't give you the full effect. You've got to go there to appreciate such natural wonders, and you'll have to rent or buy this DVD to appreciate the wonder of Bette Davis on autocamp as a former child star grown up into, well, read on and see.

Jane Hudson (Bette Davis) had it all when she was a child. A hit song insured that big audiences turned out to see her perform on the stage. Unfortunately, little Jane suffered from an ego the approximate size of Wyoming, an ego that resulted in temper tantrums with her parents and her sister Blanche (Joan Crawford). Eventually her raging sense of self torpedoed her career even as her sister's began to soar when the film industry blossomed. Jane Hudson sank into obscurity, liquor, cigarettes, and a monstrous case of mental illness that greatly accelerated when a tragic accident put Blanche in a wheelchair for life. Now the two sisters live together in a decrepit house reminiscing about the old days. Well, at least Blanche reminisces. Jane Hudson spends her time stalking around the house in pancake makeup and a gossamer gown now tattered and spattered, spewing sarcasm and veiled threats at her sister, the neighbors, and the maid who arrives once a week to see how things are going. Hudson still thinks it's possible to resurrect her long dead celebrity if only she can figure out a way to rid herself of the onerous burden that is Blanche. Obviously, she finds a way. She begins tormenting her sister by placing disgusting things in her food and making her sound crazy to outsiders. When that fails to work fast enough, she resorts to out and out physical violence.

With Blanche under lock and key in a bedroom upstairs, Jane begins the rigorous training all performers undertake to return to greatness. She hires a down and out musician by the name of Edwin Flagg (Victor Buono) to drop by the house for voice and dance lessons. Now the real insanity starts as Hudson rapidly devolves back into her childhood persona. She prances about the house singing her old musical numbers, giving it her all without realizing how incredibly grotesque the idea of an elderly woman imitating a child is. Flagg thinks Jane is crackers, and he's right more than he could possibly know, but a paycheck is a paycheck. Until he finds out what is going on in a bedroom upstairs, that is. Faced with the distasteful presence of the local constabulary and the probability of a lot of probing questions about what's been going on between the two sisters, Hudson packs Blanche in the car for a trip to the beach. I won't spoil the conclusion of this cult classic for you, but let's just say a startling revelation at the seashore proves to be the straw that finally pushes poor Jane Hudson over the edge. The denouement is upsetting, the sort of ending that has you putting your hand to your mouth in a ""oh my"" gesture.

""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" is a masterpiece of casting, directing, and performing. The idea of putting these two lionesses of the silver screen in the same picture was a stroke of genius on the part of director Robert Aldrich, although many questioned his sanity for making such a decision. Wouldn't the two actresses tear each other apart on set? Apparently not, but there were a few confrontations--including a thrown back and some real kicks delivered in a certain scene--and sniping that hinted at the turmoil just under the surface. Aldrich moved forward, crafting a film that is both claustrophobic in its set pieces and one that uses the black and white photography to great advantage. The film really succeeds, however, because of Bette Davis. She blows Joan Crawford out of the water in this movie, although to be fair Davis from the start had the meatier role. Her garish appearance and screeching voice deliver the chills to the nth degree, and her progressive decline into total insanity is shocking and absolutely convincing. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her disturbing portrayal of Jane Hudson, and rightfully so. She should have won. I've seen hundreds if not thousands of horror films, and Davis's Jane Hudson ranks as one of the most disturbing characters I have witnessed in any of them.

Sadly, the DVD doesn't give us much in the way of extras aside from cast and crew biographies and a few pages of text describing the production. Then again, it's unlikely we would hear about the movie from the primary figures involved in its production since they are all long dead. Perhaps a commentary track with a film historian or a similar person could have been put on the disc; I know of other films that do this. Anyway, if you haven't seen this film you've got to run, not walk, to get a copy. It's that good, it's that disturbing, and it's that memorable.",1112918400,,5626,4.708629441624366
861142,5,6304359721,"Anyone who knows the sheerly breathtaking verve of director Robert Aldrich knows that he's used to controversy, and fares well in selling it. ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane,"" is a reprocussion from his revolt against traditional subject matter. ""Baby Jane,"" in it's own way, is a satirical and even somewhat depressing look at the 'fame-vs.-age' battle in Hollywood. Ironic for Davis since her film career was still going strong even in her old age (her character, the deranged Jane Hudson is the exact opposite). Ironic for Crawford since her relationship with Hollywood had begun to reach its expiration date to such B- films as ""Beserk"" and ""Strait-Jacket"" (her character is also the contrary, a wheelhchair-bound, but not forgotten former screen goddess.)

An important facet of this cult/camp classic film to consider is the fact that the rivalry between Davis and Crawford was very much reality; not just over-the-top 'performances.' It had always been said that of all of American actresses, these were the two most prolific women. However, magazines raved for decades that Davis had the genuine acting ability, and Crawford, in contrast, was the 'glamourous' starlet. When one considers the fact that both women played bitchy tricks on each other during filming, acually embodied thier characters, and brought new life to an otherwise sleeper of a film, a new degree of valor is clearly apparent.

Secondary characters include a standard performance for newcomer newcomer Buono, as the down-on-his-luck Brit pianist, Edwin Flagg. Also starring is lesser-known Maidie Norman, as Crawford's ill-fated caretaker who gets a bit more curious than Baby Jane can stand. Supporting cast is mostly unimportant, since the viewer's attention will be focused primarily on Davis' Oscar-nominated performance as the childish drunk Jane.

1960's atmosphere adds camp suitably to the overall presentation, aided largely by Michael Anderson's stock/dramatic music, and the title song, ""I've Written A Letter To Daddy."" Disappointingly, Davis didn't have much of a singing voice, so an uncredited Debbie Burton is what we actually hear onscreen (this is often neccesary, for example, Audrey Hepburn only sang one song in the complete duration of her famed ""My Fair Lady,""--'Wouldn't It Be Loverly.').

""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane is not only a thriller and a raw glance of Davis' undying talent, but a dark comedy/satire as well. Aldrich's blunt direction suggests a finger pointed directly in the face of Hollywood as an example of decaying stardom, lies, faded glory, and corruption. Don't pass this classic up, folks; it's worth every second.

861196,5,6304359721,"""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" is a classic that actually manages to hold up so well over time, that you wonder what were people thinking when they tried to remake it.  (One version starring the Redgrave sisters is just a complete waste of time and talent.)

'Baby Jane' is the tale of the aging Hudson sisters.  One sister 'Baby Jane' Hudson was a child star so popular she had a doll crafted after her.  Blanche Hudson took a different, more permanent route to stardom, but her rise to fame was derailed in a horrible accident that left her crippled, and, unfortunately, at the mercy of her sister for caretaking.  The result of the years of confinement and resentment culminate in a tragic but certainly not surprising end.

""Baby Jane"" is a remarkable film in many ways, and, in my mind, most noteably how it examines the difficult transition many child performers can't make to 'adult' star, and how fame that young can irreversiblly alter one's perception of themselves and the world around them.  It's also a fascinating look at the bad side of sibling rivalry.  More than just a 'horror' flick (which I think is a stretch), it's really a very keenly crafted psychological thriller.  What has made Davis's Jane so completely delusional?  Is Crawford's Blanche as saintly as we are lead to believe?  Excellent questions the film beautifully and slowly answers.

However, the biggest benefit to this is watching Davis and Crawford at the top of their game.  It helps to know the back story of the deep-seeded, and legendary, hatred these two had for one another.  You get the sense that Davis truly enjoyed getting to torture Crawford as much as Crawford enjoyed Davises decidedly disgusting Jane put against the Glamourous Blanche.  Davis garned a well-earned Oscar for this picture, but both actresses prove why they are the stuff of Hollywood legend in this tale of sisters, deception, and faded stardom.",1094515200,,1914,4.882352941176471

Miss Baby Jane Hudson, played with great, grotesque gusto by Davis who was once the belle of the ball. Kind of a Shirley Temple of her era.  Baby Jane was daddy's girl and Jane, therefore, has quite an Electra complex that is and has been exhibited her entire life.
Her sister, Miss Blanche Hudson, played ""aptly and sapply"" by Crawford, has a long and lasting career as an adult movie star but is now wheelchair bound because of a little ""accident"" betwixt the sisters many years back.  Jane is the caretaker of Blanche since the ""accident"" and they both live off of the residuals of Blanche's long and prosperous film career before she became crippled.
After a local California TV station decides to run summer afternoon, back to back Blanche Hudson films, Baby Jane gets that ol' jealous feeling brewing again and wants desparately to revitalize her childhood career. Baby Jane hires pianist from the classifieds, Mr. Edward Flagg, played in a great understated role by Victor Buono, who has his own Oedipal yearnings and problems.  They make a great and perfect pair of drunks and crazies, let me tell ya.
Jane is certainly unstable and is likened to a gin and vodka guzzling 60 year old broad with a six year old spoiled brat mentality.  SCARY combo, right there!  Let alone Jane's  guilt of the ""accident"", her shameless jealousy, and her expressions of the antithesis of ""SISTERLY LOVE"".
Filmed in glorious black and white, it lends itself to the dark, somber and horrific things that happen to Blanche vis-a-vis Jane...

861253,5,6304359721,"'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane' is a movie whose name will forevermore conjure up images of Bette Davis in whiteface as the screeching, unhinged Jane, rats on silver trays, and Joan Crawford dying on a beach. However, if you can look past the campy stereotypes there's a beautifully-crafted thriller here, waiting to be enjoyed as one of the definitive films of 1960's Hollywood.
Baby Jane Hudson (Bette Davis), a former child vaudevillian, is now charged with the care of her crippled movie-star sister Blanche (Joan Crawford). Having lost the use of her legs in an accident, Blanche stays mostly to her room, relying on Jane's guilt to take care of her. When Blanche decides to sell her house, Jane initiates a reign of terror over the infirm star, culminating in one of the most desolate and emotionally charged finales ever seen in pictures.
It's impossible to look away from Davis as Jane. She's loud, over-the-top, unhinged, dangerous and luminous. As one reviewer charged, she is all cliche and mannerism, and there aren't enough sequences where Davis' considerable talent as an actress is allowed to give the character any real humanity. These scenes are present, however, when Jane is drunk at the piano, or right at the end of the movie when she's buying ice cream, and it's these scenes, played so beautifully by Davis, that stop the character of Jane from becoming yet another schlock-horror Titan and propel her into our memories as one of the greats.
Joan Crawford, long considered to be the least-talented of these two actresses, turns the tables entirely in her role as the terrorised, hapless Blanche. She is winsome, emotional and most of all, she is real. Her magnificence as an Actress reveals itself in the personal exchanges with Blanche, their maid, and in those scenes where she is required to move out of her wheelchair - Crawford plays the part with empathy and pathos, and we find ourselves emotionally attached to Blanche for the entire picture.
Victor Buono as Edwin Flagg, Baby Jane's musical arranger and special friend, also deserves a special mention - his performance is greasy, two-faced and cloying, and in absolute sympathy with the character he is portraying.
Direction is excellent - Robert Aldrich has created a monster in Baby Jane, but, not content to let her carry the whole show, he gives us a genuinely creepy mansion for her to terrorise in, a house full of ambiguous shadows and beautifully lit and shot corners, staircases and window-lattices. He cleverly contrasts the pure Horror-Noir look of the Hudson interior with that of the plastic-fantastic suburban world of the neighbouring Mrs. Bates (Anna Lee) to great effect.
Like the direction, the use of music and sound too goes a long way to furthering the sense of isolation and despair in the Hudson house. Blanche's buzzer and Jane's thumping, slouchy footsteps cut through mass silences and add to the tension. Jangly jazz music (the instrumental track from a song by Debbie Burton and Bette Davis, called 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane') in the sequence where Blanche is racing against time to get a note to her neighbours adds more again to the tension and isolation.
Excellently preserved and transferred, 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' is a movie that no collection really should be without. It's a great example of how talent doesn;t fade with age, a truly chilling film, and above all else, highly entertaining.

861255,5,6304359721,"Truly chilling low-budget, cult classic thriller about a famous movie actress, Blanche (Joan Crawford) who gets into a rather nasty accident that leaves her crippled and in a wheelchair. Her sister, Jane (Bette Davis), who once was a performer as well (though much lesser known and less talented), must come and tend to Blanche. Jealous of her sister, Jane becomes increasingly more violent and cruel to Blanche and their housekeeper's suspicions are raised when many peculiar things begin to happen that are evidently connected to Jane herself. This 1962 thriller is extremely powerful, with brilliant performances, sparkling production design and direction and a great script. Bette Davis is spine-tingling and over-the-top as the psychopath sister who is truly ahead of her time (as she sometimes says things that didn't appear as normal on film until 1967). Joan Crawford is also very good as the crippled Blanche who seems so innocent and sweet, you just have to have sympathy for her. An amazingly inspirational film, this has become one of the best of its genre even for today's gore-loving audiences (which I am not apart of).",1070582400,,1134,5.135135135135135
861256,5,6304359721,"A captivating masterpiece of the Grand Guignol school, WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is one of those rare horror movies that can be chilling, repulsive, and downright terrifying, and all this without the slightest soupon of the improbable, the impossible, or the supernatural.  It is a story of the rivalry between two spinster sisters who were both once show-business superstars--the egotistical and hedonistic Jane (Bette Davis), a onetime juvenile darling of the vaudeville stage but now a talentless has-been; and the gracious and congenial Blanche (Joan Crawford), formerly a popular and highly talented movie actress whose career was cut short by a crippling auto accident.  Circumstances and kinship obligations have forced them to live together, their sole income the being the interest from Blanche's investments.  But feeling trapped in a situation that has become intolerable and loathsome, Jane begins a slow spiral into madness and takes out her psychopathic aggressions on the invalid Blanche in increasingly twisted ways.
Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were both facing waning careers when they were cast in this movie, but outstanding performances from both jump-started those careers and propelled the women back into the hearts of the public.  Bette Davis is especially superb as the selfish and sadistic Jane, both compelling and believable in her portrayal of the onetime child star who has degenerated into a repulsive and vulgar reflection of her former self.  Also notable is the appearance of actor Victor Buono, who here makes his film debut in the supporting role of a young, out-of-work pianist attempting to mooch a few dollars off of spinster Jane.  Davis and Buono each received Oscar nominations for their performances.
WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE? is sharp, compelling--and scary!  The Warner DVD is short on extras, and the digital transfer could have used a little clean-up on the scratches and wear artifacts, but it is still well worth the reasonable price and will make a fine addition to the collection of any horror fan.",1066089600,,2065,5.239393939393939
861257,5,6304359721,"Bette Davis and Joan Crawford - one reviewer summed it up when he said we will never see stars of their greatness again. Both reigned Hollywood during the era of glamour and melodrama. Crawford was the great beauty - ranked with Garbo and Dietrich as a supreme glamour symbol during the 1930s. As she matured, she became the great actress - and anyone who has seen Humoresque or Mildred Pierce must agree. She was, however, best as the suffering, glamorous heroine of wistful melodramas. Bette, on the other hand, was star at Warners and was less wistful and more practical than Joan - that's the best way I can describe the difference between Joan and Bette. Joan was the romantic dreamer, and Bette the practical realist. Naturally, both were very jealous of each other, their feud in Hollywood was legendary. Although very much alike, they had huge inner differences.
  Whatever Happened to Baby Jane was the very first movie I had seen with either actress. I saw it about seven years ago on AMC when I was 11. That would make the year about 1996. Anyway, 1996 was not a very glamorous or melodramatic year, and just the sight of Bette Davis caked in ghostly white Baby Jane makeup was enough to capture my imagination. Who was this tragic creature, I wondered. The story was just brilliant. I had never seen anything like it. Between the rats in the cellar, dramatic alcoholism, and the haunting appearance of Bette, I was in some kind of cinematic realm I had never entered before - and I loved it!  So, naturally, I became a huge fan of Bette Davis - much to the confusion of everyone else my age.
  It is only as I look at the film now, that I realize Joan Crawford was just as much the equal of Bette, and possibly the better actress in general. That she was able to give such a sensitive and subtle performance at this stage in her life - alcoholism had taken a great toll - is proof that she really was a master.  The character of Blanche was originally intended to be just as bizarre and crazy as Baby Jane. However, Joan insisted that her character be glamorous and appear somewhat human. This must have helped the film tremendously - because the humanity of Blanche allows us to feel sympathy for her character - without that sympathy her character wouldn't have been the ""straight man"" and the film, simply, wouldn't have worked!  When you want to acknowledge who really saved Baby Jane - thank Joan Crawford, the real genius behind the project (she was, remember, the one who found the book in the first place and insisted that Robert Aldrich direct it, skyrocketing his career and Bette's!)  What a shame that Joan didn't receive the Oscar, but how glad I am that she accepted for Anne Bancroft at the Oscars! Go Joan...the ultimate diva.",1065571200,,2754,4.594704684317719
861258,5,6304359721,"Bette Davis and Joan Crawford were two over the hill actresses by the time they made this movie. It was so brave of them to make this lurid shocker; it revied their sagging careers and made moviegoers line up at the box offcie. The movie is lurid, outrageous and one of my all time favorites. Bette Davis goes over the top (and that's saying alot for Bette) as a former child star gone to seed. She slouches around her home in a fright wig, bedroom slippers, and makeup that looks like she put it on with a putty knife. She stays drunk and bitter while she tries to revive her stage show from about 50 years ago. Meanwhile, her wheelchair bound sister is trapped upstairs. As Bette goes mad, her poor sister becomes a victem of torture and abuse. The whole show is shocking and outrageous and not to be missed.

Trying to punish Blanche for her years of success, Jane tortures the housebound woman, slowly trying to starve her to death, all the while attempting to recapture the fame of her youth. This dark drama also stars Victor Buono as the hefty pianist who answers Jane's ad for an accompanist, hoping to milk some money off the demented old woman.

Davis is remarkable as the crazy sister who is still convinced she is the child star she once was ""Baby Jane"".

The talent is obvious in the writers and whoever dreamed up this story. Robert Aldrich did brilliant direction (as he did on Hush...Hush... Sweet Charlotte also showcasing Davis losing her mind). And speaking of Bette Davis, in those days there weren't too many actresses willing to look frumpy and ugly. She relished it until she saw herself on screen for the first time when she ran out crying.
It was criminal that the Queen of Hollywood didn't get the Academy Award for her performance. Joan Crawford was a bit restricted in her role simply because of the character she played. Victor Buono, in his first feature role I think, was nominated for an Oscar and you'll see why. He was talented enough to show so many emotions and be comedic at the right times without overdoing it.

The plot will keep you on the edge of your seat, and you'll be dying for MORE!! this film was really really worth seeing, and it was GREAT!! SEE IT!!
Disgustingly captivating and spine-tingling scenes will leave you dying for more of this film. Bette Davis plays the demented ""Baby"" Jane Hudson, a former child-star of Vaudeville. Playing her younger sister Blanche is Joan Crawford. Blanche was always forced to stand in the shadow of her sister, who was really the money-maker in the family.
But all that changes when Vaudeville becomes passe, and Jane's career is over before she's twelve. Then Blanche bursts through and becomes one of the era's most popular screen actresses. Now Jane is the minor and Blanche the major; roles have been reversed. But in a freak car accident, Blanche is crippled. For the rest of her life, she is confined to a wheelchair. So who's left to ""take care"" of her, watch over her, and do everything she asks for?
Jane.
Insanely jealous and wickedly minded, Jane tortures Blanche almost daily. Every minute is like a living hell as Blanche tries to make up excuses for Jane's behavior...until she finally goes over the edge.
I repeat: the acting in this film is incredible, and the off-screen hatred between Crawford and Davis is extremely palpable, giving the movie an even more twisted aspect. SEE THIS!!",1048896000,,1504,4.87890625

Due to a horrible accident many years prior, Joan Crawford's character is forced to be taken care of by her unstable sister who has regressed in dress and personality to when she was the popular vaudeville child star ""Baby Jane.""
The performances given by Davis and Crawford are even that much better because these two legends could not stand each other offscreen! Not only were they portraying women who fight and argue constantly, but they were also living it.

My only complaint is that ever since ""Mommie Dearest"" was released, it has been somewhat taboo to say anything good about Joan Crawford.  While I do not want to downplay the abuse in the slightest, much of it has been disputed by Crawford's other children, and it must also be pointed out that Bette Davis was accused of abuse by her children as well, yet nobody seems to worry about singing Davis' praises.
I believe Joan Crawford's subdued performance in this movie is what gave it credibility as a serious film rather than just a horror flick by 2 old broads.  A true test of talent is the restraint and true emotion that Crawford showed throughout this movie.  Both Bette and Joan deserved Oscars for their performances, no doubt.

A once-popular Hollywood movie star of the 193O's, Blanche has been wheelchair-bound for 25 years due to an accident which rendered her crippled for life. And that's all you're gonna get from me plot-wise. It must be admitted that Bette Davis was indeed a fearless and brilliantly versatile performer. I really can't think of any other actress of her stature who would allow herself to look so blantantly ugly in order to please her multitude of fans as Davis did for this film back in 1962. When Bette made ALL ABOUT EVE, a dozen years prior, the critics were not only astonished by her performance, but by her sheer willingness to look every day of her then 42 years. At the age of 54, Davis made herself up to look like hell, but she again stunned the critics (for the most part, anyway) and the public alike. For Baby Jane, Davis did her own make-up. The wig Davis wore was an ancient bleached-out Mary Pickford-type which was literally falling apart: it dated back to the mid-twenties. It was rumored that Crawford once wore it in a silent! Ironic, eh? Davis used kohl around her eyes, painted on a greasy bow-tie mouth & applied white calcimine & rice powder for Jane's ""shut-in"" complextion. Davis adapted her sister Bobby's shuffle when walking. As Blanche, Crawford acknowleged HER legion of fans by not looking particularly unkempt: she was very conscious performance-wise: it is one of her finest and definitely most unusual performances. A little-known fact is that it was entirely Crawford's idea to work with Davis. Joan come into Bette's dressing room with the idea doing Baby Jane during the run of NIGHT OF THE IGUANA in which Davis starred as Maxine Faulk. Davis wasn't exactly enamoured of the idea at first (she was not a Crawford devotee at all). Davis later pondered: ""Crazy Bette and phoney Joan? - it might just work"".

This is a study in madness and delusion of the first order. Bette Davis should have won the Oscar for her portrayal of Baby Jane Hudson. Her characterization is still macabre after all these years. Her victimization of sister Blanche (a subdued Joan Crawford) is still disturbing in it's demented ferociousness. This is a Hollywood Horror Story. To call it a ""horror movie"" isn't fair. It's a psychological thriller if you need to place it in a genre. It's a classic film any way you look at it. The TV remake was abysmally unnecessary.  And now a musical?  Well that should up the sales of the DVD anyway. But ""Baby Jane"" is too serious subject matter to be called ""camp"". Blanche is handicapped. She is tormented by her crazed sister over grudges developed years before. The starvation, the physical abuse, the mental torture---these are all too seriously played out to be dismissed as just ""camp"". These scenes are gripping and squirmish to watch. The movie is too well made to be taken that lightly by cultists and newcomers to it. And the acting is too serious to elicit chuckles instead of shivers.

Nowadays, those of my age (when I saw the film) don't blink at slasher films. What happened?...This film scared the pants off me at the time. It's a genuine account of jealousy, delusional grandeur, and a slow descent into madness, a popular theme today but not often done as well. (I also saw the TV remake with the Redgraves, and didn't think it as smarmy as the critics, though not as good as the original.) This is the film that launched a deluge of ""grand guignol"" flicks using grand old dames of yesteryear...Tallulah Bankhead (Die! Die! My Darling!), Olivia de Havilland (Lady in a Cage), Joan Crawford (Strait-Jacket). Bette Davis (Dead Ringer); and others that don't immediately come to mind. The DVD has been around for a while, but I just got it, and was impressed, especially with the (printed) backgroud info. The legendary feud of Davis & Crawford was apparentlty fabricated; they wanted very much to work together. Davis was quoted as saying that ""women were too smart to have feuds""... Indeed, the extras weren't live, but the DVD has crisp photography in a good 1.85:1 letterbox. It's not necessary to go into the plot and storyline, because if you're reading this, you already know this is a classic. Davis is, indeed, brilliant, and I think Crawford matches her every step of the way, in her own descent into despair. There are a lot of illogical plot points, such as why Crawford, with all her money, didn't get herself one of those wheel-chair staircase elevator-type things (like in Wm Castle's ""Homicidal""), or an in-house elevator (""Lady in a Cage""). Also, Crawford's always alone in her room...why didn't she yell at the neighbors to say ""hello""? This was Victor Buono's first film, and though he didn't play a bad guy (well, not really) he was subsequently cast as bad guys. Too bad. I thought he showed great promise in ""Baby Jane"" and wonder why his career went to hell. Robert Aldrich, a great and underrated director, used Davis and, briefly, Buono, in ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"", another ""grand guignol"" type film, which I thought was great. He brought another old great actress, Agnes Moorehead, to an Oscar nomination. When will this be released on DVD? When classic actresses are so involved in making themselves look ugly to produce such a positive and overpowering effect..this, to me, is CLASS! Much of the credit goes to Aldrich, though he admits that Davis created her own ugly make-up, and was glad he didn't have to ask her to do so. See this on DVD, a really fine transfer. And let's rally for a DVD version of ""Hush...Charlotte""; another misconception was that Crawford wanted to do ""Hush"" but was ill, so Bette suggested her good friend de Havilland.

Betty Davis as Jane Hudson and real life nemesis Joan Crawford as sister Blanche Hudson make for comic and scary thrills. Quick retread: Jane was ""Baby Jane Hudson"", a child star who lost her popularity after puberty. Blanche Hudson was jealous as a child but becomes a top rated adult movie actress as an adult. Jane, of course, becomes an increasingly insane alcoholic. Trouble ensues when Blanche is mysteriously crippled in a car wreck forcing 'whack-job' case sister Jane to care for her. The plot thickens as quickly as Jane loses her mind. It's hilarious. But the sadistic scenes Jane carries out on Blanche are both scary and hilarious, making this film a true cult classic. The ending is a masterpiece of plot twists!

I can't get into more details other than to tell you that every time I've shown someone this movie, they go nuts over it! It's frightening and comedic simultaneously. It's no wonder these two characters have been Halloween favorites for years!
Quality of 'black & white' is okay and sound is what you would expect from an early 60's nightmare, but it's worth it.

My older sister dragged me to the theater because there was a ""spooky"" movie playing, about two old movie star sisters. What did I know? I was only 9 years old! Well, that experience scarred me for life. I sat in the darkened theater and watched these two women go at one another tooth and claw.  And Bette Davis scared ...me!...These images were to come back to me over the decades, and when videos hit the marketplace, the first one I bought was of Baby Jane. It was still great and holds up remarkably well! Now that we're in the techno age of DVDs, of course, I had to purchase the pressing of Jane! The film is remarkably contemporary...and a delicious black comedy, something I didn't realize until just now. I mean, really--a slouchy, middle-aged harridan running around like Mary Pickford on qualudes? A riotous concept!  Now, as an adult, I can pick out the flaws: (1) why doesn't Blanche just yell down to the neighbor lady next door? (2) if Blanche is so hungry, why doesn't she eat the toast and milk served with the parakeet? and (3) if Jane is such a nut case, why has she been left in charge of her very wealthy handicapped sister, who just also happens to be a ""big, fat, movie stah?""  Makes no sense. But who cares!  It's still a glorious show! Bette is truly a sight, screaming one minute, in a drunken fog the next, crying over her scrapbooks, and searching the cupboards for a full bottle of booze. And when she reprises that annoying ""Letter to Daddy"" song as an old crone, it's riveting. You simply cannot look away. I remember how shocked I was to learn that Bette had once been an actual leading lady, with a nice figure and a pretty face! What the hell happened in the interim? Joan Crawford is excellent as Blanche, though her role is decidedly secondary to Bette's.  No wonder Davis was nominated for an Academy Award.  And she deserved to win, too--not that wimpy Ann Bancroft in the (ugh) ""Miracle Worker.""  I should also mention that Victor Buono more than holds his own in his brief scenes, and his first meeting with Jane is a hoot!  Listen to their dialogue closely!  WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE is top notch entertainment all the way, and I highly recommend it. Kudos to Bette Davis!  She was one in a million, and we'll never see the likes of her again.

861512,4,6304359721,"Unfortunately, this version of ""Baby Jane"" has distorted the original intention of the director. Until Warner Brothers comes up with the original cut scenes and eliminates the last quarter of the film as seen here, we have only a fragmentary and very distorted film. Most viewers have assumed, based on this release, that this is a sort of gothic horror movie about two aging sisters, one an invalid, and another (Bette Davis) a mad former child star. The released version ends with the two on the beach - Baby Jane mad as a goose and Crawford's character near death as she confesses to being the cause of her own crippling accident. THIS IS NOT WHAT WAS IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT!! Warner Brothers screened the film and found the original happy ending so unmarketable that they demanded reshoots and turned what was meant as a gentle hymn to sisterly love into a garish spook show. The director needed a hit and he caved in to the powers that be, but he always regretted selling out his artistic vision for a few bucks as he knew the original film had a dignity which this released version did not. The original script has Crawford actually convincing the doctor on the phone that Jane needs help. An ambulance arrives. In a scene reminisicent of Tennessee Williams, Jane is led away to the mental hospital where she receives the help she needs. After two years, Jane returns, slimmed down, radiant with good mental and physical health (those who saw the screening say that the transformation of Bette Davis in her grand re-entrance was ""spectacular""), Jane becomes archivist of her sister's films and begins a major revival of her sister's film career which ends with the two of them touring Europe and the main film festivals where Jane takes great pride in the work she has done to revive her sister's prestige. The final shot is of the two of them, tear filled eyes, being greeted by a standing ovation in Paris. Too bad that we may have to wait until the DVD to see the reconstruction.

Even as a child, the mania and dysfunction of these sisters' relationship was gripping... like a car accident -- you don't want to see what happened, but you can't help BUT wonder what happened!
As a result, I have become a life-long classic movie fan.  No matter how many movies I have seen, ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" is still my absolute, all-time favorite.

Bette Davis was excellent as Baby Jane because she was so ugly, unpredictable and desperate.  She never missed a beat... unless she was having a particularly insane day.  You know what it's like when you're stuck in the past and you can't get over the fact that you're not five years old anymore... you don't know what that's like?  Oh, good.
There are a couple of slip ups in the movie, deeming it a little unrealistic, but if you didn't let them pass, you'd have the movie end prematurely I guess.
It is kind of haunting and sad to see the photos and memoirs of both women when they were young, loved and famous.  It really shows what damage you can do to yourself when you're not willing to age gracefully. (Take note, Melanie Griffith)

Now the good stuff.  The sisters are played by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (the only time the two ever acted together) to absolute perfection.  Crawford is wonderful in the role of crippled sister Blanche, but Miss Davis absolutely walks away with the show as the former ""Baby"" Jane Hudson.  The role is meatly and she revels in it!  It is obvious that Miss Davis held the philosophy that, if you are going to go over-the-top, don't apologize.  And she doesn't.  She goes WAY over-the-top with a gleeful abandon that is infectious.
The way she taunts her wheelchair-bound sister (the title quotes one of Jane's best lines), serves her meals of dead rodents and ex-pets, kicks her in the gut, mocks her ever-so-proper speech, etc.  It's all so delicious.  And check out the ballet that she does to one of the songs from her childhood vaudeville act.  Bette Davis was obviously having the time of her life, and so do the viewers of this classic.
For the DVD edition, there are disappointingly few extras, but Davis is credited with developing the absolutely hideous hair and makeup combinations she sports while slouching about the house in her scuffs and house coat (Director Robert Aldrich said that, while he loved the look, he never would have had the nerve to suggest such a thing to Bette Davis).
Joan Crawford was in fine form, as well.  But for Jane to be able to be credible doing the things she did, Blanche had to be the ""straight man"".  Crawford or Aldrich knew this and Blanche behaves accordingly.  Consequently, it is Bette Davis' Jane who has the best lines and the showier part in general.

Every second is a haunting one, drawing the viewer into the story, until the viewer can concentrate on nothing else. Bette Davis  (in the most bizzare role of what can be said as an EXTREMELY bizzare but  illustrious career) plays Jane Hudson, a sixty-year-old has-been child star  with a fragile, six-year-old mind. She lives with her sister Blanche  (marvelously played by Joan Crawford), who was believed to be crippled by  Jane. Blanche was a famous actress of Hollywood's Golden Years, but was  supposedly crippled by her jealous sister at the peak of her success. The  two live in a decaying, thirties-style house in Hollywood. When Blanche's  popularity is revived by her films being shown on television, her drunken  sister decides to revive her own kiddie act. In the process, she  maliciously cuts off her sister from the outside world, throwing out her  telephone, serving her dead birds and rats (two of the film's most  memorable scenes), and eventually tying  and gagging her crippled sister,  leaving her in a dark room to die. Bette Davis and Joan Crawford are said  never to have gotten along at all, and in these scenes it is particularly  unnerving to observe this truth on film. But most memorable is the  anticlimatic scene in which it is finally revealed just how Blanche was  crippled, and Jane's mental balance snaps. But for all the grotesque,  haunting two hours of movie, and sickening truths revealed at film's end,  the hardening finality of the film's final shot determines that the  question asked at the movie's beginning could never and will never be  answered: ""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?"".",960595200,,1718,5.0177304964539005

Those  who feel animosity toward Joan for her rumored child abusing may find it a  bit entertaining seeing Bette kick her in the gut. It's interesting how the  film seems to almost satirize the way that the actresses were portrayed in  life by the media: Joan was always played as sort of a ""saint""  (she starred in movies like ""Mildred Pierce"" and adopted two  children), while Bette had a reputation for being rather cantankerous;  similarly, in the film, Joan's character, Blanche, is made out to be a bit  too saintly, while Davis's Jane is incredibly cruel (although you may feel  compelled to feel some pity for her . . you definitely will in the end).  As far as suspense/horror goes, as previously stated, you'll see most of  the scares coming a mile away, and you'll probably be frustrated at the  general stupidity of the characters' actions (especially the next door  neighbor, Mrs. Bates, and Blanche's maid, Elvira).

The movie starts in 1917 as child star Baby Jane Hudson is singing for her  many fans an eerie, yet amusing-sounding song entitled ""I've Written a  Letter to Daddy,"" and also shows some of the behind-the-scenes events  that take place with the child [and her family].  The next scene is in 1935  when Jane's sister, Blanche (played by Joan Crawford), has evolved into a  beautiful woman, and also the new talent of the family; she has become a  very successful actress.  However, There is an accident, of which Jane is  held accountable, and Blanche is crippled for life.  The final jump in  time is to ""Yesterday"" (as it is called in the movie), with  Blanche in a wheelchair and Jane as her caretaker.  They live in an old  mansion where Blanche is blocked off from the rest of the world, and Jane  terrorizes her, apparently as revenge for having to take care of the sister  she hates.  This current week, a television station is having a  ""Blanche Hudson Marathon,"" making Blanche more and more desired  by the public to be seen.  Enraged with jealousy, Jane terrorizes Blanche  more than ever, starving her and taking the phone, her last  ""window"" to the outside world, away from her.  As all this  unfolds, Jane goes from an old, cruel, drunken woman to a childlike maniac,  trying to relive the days when she was famous.

861807,5,6304359721,"In their only appearance together on film - they didn't have any scenes together in the 1944 wartime morale - boosting film HOLLYWOOD CANTEEN - Davis and Crawford each sparked their quickly fading careers by doing this excursion into the macabre. The picture isn't exactly Hitchcock, and it goes on and on in a light dimmer than necessary, and the climax - when it belatedly arrives - is rather something of a cop-out. However, this low - budget film which was directed by Robert Aldrich has achieved cult status, because the acting impresses those who relish it. Bette Davis is absolutely amazing in her characterization of a misfit who can't forget that she was once a child star in vaudeville. Bette had just been through what she termed her ""ten black years"" when this movie thrust forward her screen stock and again made her a bankable star. Joan Crawford plays the role of Blanche, a wheelchair bound cripple and former movie star who lives in constant torment due to her sister's shenanigans. Crawford, (who is considerably better groomed than Davis) wisely underplays Bette and director Aldrich drew to nicely contrasted performances from two actresses the likes of which we'll never see again. Davis is astonishingly grotesque in her playing of Jane and the public ate it up in 1962; it was the runaway sleeper hit of the year.  If these two legendary stars did indeed have a feud, there certainly aren't many juicy stories connected with it in books: it is probable that they respected each other enough to succumb to such drudgery. It is well - known that Joan enjoyed Pepsi spiked with vodka, insisted that the set be kept at fifty degrees and would say ""bless you"" for ""thank-you"". Bette was her unaffected opposite and walked around the set in slippers and an old robe with make-up on the collar. Victor Bouno plays obese mama's boy Edwin Flagg and his acting is at once grotesque and brilliant. That's Bette's fourteen year old daughter B.D. playing Anna Lee's daughter; she would marry in real life two years later and the marriage is still going strong; in 1985, she would pen her infamous ""expose"" MY MOTHER'S KEEPER.  Davis received her tenth (!) Academy Award nomination for this macabre classic and footage from two of her vintage films PARACHUTE JUMPER & EX-LADY (both 1933) were used to show what a lousy actress Baby Jane was as a young woman - the old movie in which Blanche watches herself with genuine fondness at is a 1934 MGM flick entitled SADIE MCKEE.",944352000,,2482,4.783216783216783
