8436946,5,B004O39TGK,This is the single best hunting DVD I have ever purchased! This man hunts one of the most difficult ways possible. He has the records in Pope & Young to back it up. If you are hunting state land in high pressured areas then this DVD is for you.,1474329600,,244,4.0
8436947,5,B004O39TGK,A must to see!,1464739200,,14,2.75
8436948,5,B004O39TGK,"John Eberhart is the ""DeerFather""; my hunting has gone to the next level through his books and now his videos.",1458432000,,110,4.55
8436949,5,B004O39TGK,"Some of the information is repetitive between the three volumes, but this DVD set is definitely much more informative and offers some ""how to's"" that just don't exist with other mainstream hunting videos. I am an average hunter that is hunting public land with most of the rest of us, looking to improve my skills. If that is you, this video by the Eberharts can help you become better and learn to behave differently than the crowd to improve your chances at success.",1455667200,,468,4.650602409638554
8436950,5,B004O39TGK,Highly Recommed!  Completely changed how I hunt bucks.,1454457600,,54,5.75
8436951,5,B004O39TGK,"This can definitely be helpful for any hunter.  The Eberharts do not push any products, nor do they brag at all about their own past successes.  They made these videos to simply inform other hunters on what works for them.  There is a lot of information and they give it to the audience very quick.  Take time to watch this and enjoy one of the few hunting videos on the market not filled with endorsements and unrealistic antler expectations.",1428192000,,443,4.569620253164557
8436952,5,B004O39TGK,"Vol 1 and 2 are similiar but overall a great product, from a true hunter. HIts very importnat details and very inforamtive. Would recommend to any bowhunter at any level.",1397001600,,170,4.7
8436953,5,B004O39TGK,"Great video.  I love that it is educational rather than promotional.  I now look at my hunting areas totally differently, and have found myself saying ""I bet there is a deer trail over there"" many times based on what I learned in this video.  And there is!  While you may not watch this and immediately get a buck for the record books, this will be another arrow in your quiver.",1384300800,,378,4.357142857142857
