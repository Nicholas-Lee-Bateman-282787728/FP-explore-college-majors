8752588,1,B01C9P3514,i think it stinks that the blu ray industry has changed where you cant watch them on just any blu ray play . i have a vizio bluray which doesnt play anything new. and they do not offer updates for there players anymore . so i reccomend no one buy blurays anymore.,1483056000,4,263,4.076923076923077
