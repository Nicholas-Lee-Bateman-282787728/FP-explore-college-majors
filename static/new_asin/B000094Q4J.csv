This is a lovey physical production, settings, costumes, and general presentation are all really enchanting - the first act looks like a beautiful water color illustration in a very classy children's book. And speaking of children, that is what we have here, the students of the ballet school of Paris Opera. The idea of such a youthful cast for this naive story might seem perfect on the surface, and indeed upon first viewing, these fresh faced youngsters seem ideal for this story of fantasy and fantastic invention. It's all very charming - for about ten minutes. But then the need for a bit more technical prowess and developed dramatic skills begin to glare. These are talented youngsters, make no mistake about that. But Coppelia is not a work that ""plays itself"", its comedy and gentle charm are tricky, and while Delibes score is delightful, it is not one of the great ballet scores that stands well on its own without skilled illumination from its performers. It isn't that anyone here is bad, it is just unformed, technically and dramatically. The mime is very two dimensional and limited - the work isn't terribly complex, its true, but the complete lack of subtle skill quickly becomes wearing. It's very cute, but cute doesn't quite cut it for a full length entertainment. One wonders if there was an awareness of that, as the third act is cut, much of the score with it.

This might make a fine introduction to ballet for interested children - it is colorful and young people love to see other young people perform - but adult ballet lovers will likely find its charms limited.",1116806400,13,1692,4.716216216216216
1879635,5,B000094Q4J,"after seeing this first, the version recorded in 2000 by the Royal

Ballet (London) also available from Amazon seemed so wooden and

dispirited. Maybe Coppelia should be cast with young dancers only.

The corps de ballet of the Opera de Paris ballet school seems better trained than that of the Royal Ballet, where perfect synchronisation seems to have fallen out of fashion since the mid-Nineties. The cutting of the third act also makes the ""drama""

much tighter. For those interested in how these dancers are trained

I recommend the DVD ""Etoiles"", a docu by Nils Tavernier also filmed

in 2001.",1108771200,2,598,4.93
1879636,4,B000094Q4J,"I bought this DVD expecting to see another brilliant performance by the Opera National de Paris.  As I watched it, though, I wondered why it seemed so much like a student production until I read the booklet...it IS a student production.  With the exception of Dr. Coppelius, the Burgomeister, and someone called ""la Mere"" (presumably Franz's mother), none of the dancers in this production are over the age of 17, and all are students at the Ecole de Danse of the ONdP.

The result of this is a mixed bag.  16-year-old (in 2001) Charline Giezendanner is a charming Swanilda, but she is lost amid the chaos of Act 1, the main purpose of which seems to be to give everybody in the school a chance to be on stage.  The czardas and the famous mazurka are so crowded that one wonders how they manage to keep from maiming each other, and the dancers skip offstage with a bizarre ""wave-to-mommy-and-daddy"" move that works for Disney shows, but not classical ballet.  There is also a noticeable absence of partnering in Act 1 (and in the whole ballet for that matter); Swanilda and Franz interact mainly in mime, and the ""Ballade de l'Epi"", in which Franz usually tries to convince Swanilda of his love for her, becomes mostly a solo for Giezendanner.  Maybe this is a good thing; Mathieu Ganio is woefully miscast as Franz, and his character comes off as a smirking, shallow jerk rather than a feckless but good-hearted flirt.  Even his first display of mime seems to indicate that he really doesn't like Swanilda all that much, and you have to wonder what she sees in him.  He also doesn't dance much except for a brief solo, which for some bizarre reason has been placed smack in the middle of the ""Theme slave varie"" (the dance for Swanilda and her friends).  I have to say I was horribly disappointed in Act 1.

Act 2 is a vast improvement.  Unfettered by the hordes of young etudiantes around her, Giezendanner comes alive here and shows us what she can really do.  There are some wonderful comic moments between Giezendanner and Pierre Lacotte (Dr. Coppelius), accompanied by great dancing by Giezendanner (her ""Bolero"" is a real treat).  Thankfully, Ganio spends most of Act 2 leaning on a table.  The ending is a bit strange --- half the village files into Coppelius's workshop for a mazurka reprise --- but I suppose the ballet had to end somewhere since Act 3 has been deleted.  There is also a fascinating bonus documentary about the students of the Ecole de Danse, most of which is subtitled in English although some of the studio chatter has been overlooked.

Overall?  Well, it's a GOOD Coppelia, but not a GREAT one.  I found myself fast-forwarding through a lot of Act 1, but Act 2 is much better.  I gave the review four stars for the second act, but the first act only deserves three.",1102377600,21,2795,4.619433198380567

7989710,5,B000094Q4J,"This was performed in 1976 in Budapest, on a stage but presented as a film. There is something very odd about the colors in this film. Whatever they did, and however they did it, all the dancers appear to be puppets. This effect is enhanced by the black pointe shoes worn by the ballerinas in Act I. I did not figure out the dancers are real living people until the third Act. (Perhaps I am stupid. Even after watching it four times, I still see all the ballerinas as puppets in the first scene.)  :-) :-) :-)
The story line is totally difference from the Covent Garden 2000 performance. I had to read the booklet and view this film several times to get the story and interpret the mime being performed. Once I understood the story, I must say it is most entertaining and enjoyable! I will prize it together with my copy of the 2000 Covent Garden Coppelia.",1412035200,3,856,4.383647798742138
7989711,5,B000094Q4J,"I never saw Paris Opera Ballet live. It was nice to see their ballet students on stage. Unfortunately only two acts, too bad  they skipped the wedding.",1371945600,,151,4.592592592592593
7989712,5,B000094Q4J,I bought this DVD as a gift. It is the same as the one I have. I once bought the DVD of an opera. I was very disappointed. It had poor lighting and I could not return it. I would buy more DVD if I could get a free sample,1319587200,,220,3.42

7989714,3,B000094Q4J,"I purchased this DVD knowing it was a student production and that it would not likely stand up to the Australian version I own.  The dancers are very technical and clean and they smile a lot.  Sometimes too much.  I was disappointed in the dancer's lack of commitment to the acting and miming in this ballet.  The comedic aspects of this story are what make it so delightful and fun to watch and the students in this production just didn't quite have that required aspect down.

The first and second acts are the only ones presented in this DVD, the third act being completely cut.  I do not recommend this performance of Coppelia for anyone who has previous experience with this story.  But it is technically clean and the young dancers will obviously go on to have wonderful careers in the dance world.  They just aren't quite there yet.  The costumes and scenery are lovely and for a student production it is done well.

There is also a brief documentary included on this DVD about the Paris Opera Ballet School.  I found parts of that very interesting, but for anyone who has seen ""Children of Theatre Street"" it is similar in many ways.",1185667200,3,1141,4.571428571428571

7989716,4,B000094Q4J,I found this ballet very nice. The choreography is a little different to the classical one I remembered. This ballet let us have a nice moment.,1167868800,,143,4.538461538461538
7989717,5,B000094Q4J,"Coppelia is one of my favorite classical ballets and this is a very fine and interesting two act version.  It is specially choreographed for the students of the Paris Opera Ballet School.  They are not too young(teenagers) and dance quite well.  As you may know, Ganio went on to become one of the POB's great stars.  I was especially intrigued by the fact that the choreography is not only interesting, but also age appropriate.  It is designed to prevent injury to the young dancers.  The best thing about this dvd is actually the wonderful, full-length documentary about the ballet school.  It shows very technical details of the dance classes and focuses on the very fine teachers there, including some illustrious visiting teachers, such as Elizabeth Platel(she later became the director of the school after her mandatory retirement at the age of forty from performing with the POB).  If you love ballet documentaries, don't pass this one up--this is one of my favorites!",1143158400,5,976,4.981481481481482
