1995687,4,B0001E7TL8,"It seems you can't think of the 1970s and Drive-In movies without Charles B. Pierce coming up.  And he deserves the thought -- after all, he gave us 'The Legend of Boggy Creek', one of the best-remembered mockumentaries of that decade.  And here he is again with 'The Evictors', a movie supposedly based on true events.  Whether the events are really true or not makes no difference.  The movie works either way.  Basically, Michael Parks (in a really good, understated performance) and the lovely Jessica Harper move into a house with all sorts of awful history in its past.  As the couple gets settled in, they discover that someone doesn't want them in the house.  And as Jessica Harper asks her neighbors and new friends about the house, she is treated to all sorts of awful stories about former occupants getting killed in all sorts of awful ways.  It seems the same person (a huge guy with overalls and a field hat) has been making sure the house always stays ""evicted.""  And he sure isn't going to let this new couple spoil that plan. -- In Hollywood's hands, this material could have been as boring as 'The Amityville Horror' or any number of faceless, generic slasher movies at that time.  But Charles Pierce works outside the box and delivers a really frightening and suspenseful movie.  This is not a slasher movie with some lunking, indestructible monster in a mask running around killing teenagers.  It isn't supernatural either.  It's a movie about unstable people and the house they aim to protect (heh heh heh).  The movie takes place in the 1940s, and the look is authentic, as are the extras who clearly aren't actors, but folks from Louisiana who add believability to their roles.  Each time a new horror story about the house's past is told, the movie delivers the scenes in a sepia/black and white tone which adds a nice touch overall. Michael Parks especially puts in good time here and is really good.  So is Jessica Harper as his wife.  The only miscast seems to be Vic Morrow who just seems to contemporary for this 1940s movie.  He's not bad ... he's just out of place. -- For those who have grown up on slashers and supernatural movies with tons of special effects, you might find this movie quaint in its pacing and its execution.  It is a movie that builds to a climax rather than just popping things out at us every ten minutes.  In a way, it's a kind of innocent movie.  No gore, no graphic nudity, and no language.  That makes this movie sound harmless.  It isn't.  It really is scary and it really does make you sit at the edge of your seat.  It just doesn't do it with teenagers, masked killers or state of the art special effects.  'The Evictors' is a ""genuinely made"" movie.  Now ... if it would only come out on DVD.",1306281600,13,2753,4.553971486761711

To make matters worse, someone has left a menacing note in their mailbox, and a huge, maniacal stalker begins haunting them! Will the young couple be able to defend themselves against this mounting threat, or will they be victims of more ""accidents""? THE EVICTORS is a chiller / thriller from 1979. Though most of the big revelations are less that surprising, the movie does manage to build some suspense. Ms. Harper is quite good in her harried role, as is Parks as her hard-working husband.

1995695,3,B0001E7TL8,"I've seen tons of movies like this. Young couple moves into old house with a history Husband is never there when she needs him. Only shows up to catch a bullet. Soon as she practiced shooting, I knew she was going to shoot... well don't let me spoil it. I was also trying to figure out if the lady in the wheel chair was supposed to be wearing a wig or if it was a cheap movie... well it turned out to be both. I was trying to guess Jessica Harper's waist size during the whole movie. It was very distracting. I think it looked like 18"" or less. Does anyone know? The red dress was pretty cool too as well  as their car. Much of the movie was predictable, but I still jumped like 4 times during the movie. It scared the heck out of me and I knew it was coming. But once I saw the bad guy in the daylight, he wasn't that scary... I mean guys that look like Gomer or Goober just aren't scary. I think the thing about not wanting people to move in the house was not clear. The movie was more about suspense and scary stuff than a good plot. House without electricity, phones that don't work, axes, guys sneaking around corners, thunder, ominous notes, being trapped... it was all there. But the thing that really was left hanging was ""how come no-one asked about what happened to the black guy?""  They could have had him hanging from the rafters in the barn... they had every other horror clich&eacute;, so why not? So it wasn't the greatest movie, but if you were in a drive-n with your girlfriend in your first car in Magnolia, Arkansas...",1425513600,3,1538,4.2457337883959045
1995696,4,B0001E7TL8,"Creepy an atmospheric. Very obscure film. A low budget production filmed in and around Shreveport, Louisiana in 1978. The casting of Jessica Harper must have been a real coup, as she was fresh off the success of SUSPIRIA. This film was released in 1979 by American International Pictures, the same year the studio released THE AMITYVILLE HORROR. This was one of the very few films that made me afraid to turn off the lights when I went to bed. Well worth watching.",1421107200,4,464,4.670731707317073
1995697,3,B0001E7TL8,"The Evictors (Charles B. Pierce, 1979)

There are a whole lot of directors at work in America today who should be sat downwith as much force as necessaryand made to watch The Evictors, which is an excellent example of how to make a stylish, effective thriller on a basement budget. But since that's not going to happen, I can distill what they need to learn from this movie into a single sentence: look backward, not forward. Look, if you dare, at the plague of Asylum pictures and Syfy Original Movies and all that sort of dreck, and one thing you will likely notice is that everyone's waving around CGI like it's a brand-new toy they can't get enough of. It's a very loud, flashy toy, and it annoys the hell out of mom and dad five minutes after the box is opened. Now watch the opening sequence of The Evictors, which is filmed in sepia-tone; the sequence takes place in the thirties, and Pierce was going for that kind of look. It's very well-shot, it's obviously out of place, and it does what it sets out to do. If this movie was made in 2013, that sequence would probably be CGIed to death, and the movie would be the worse for it. This is not to say that The Evictors is a perfect film, not by any stretch of the imagination, but for what it is, it is a very good one.

Ben and Ruth Watkins (Kill Bill's Michael Parks and Suspiria's Jessica Harper) are a newly-married couple who get transferred to a little town in the sticks for Ben's job. They're still not rolling in cash, so the local realtor, Jake Rudd (The Bad News Bears' Vic Morrow), shows them a cheap house not far outside of town. You've seen this movie before. As soon as they move in, the townsfolk start treating them oddly, and soon they begin hearing rumors that awful things have happened in that house. With most of the town unwilling to help them, can they figure out what's going on with their erstwhile dream home before they end up being another story the locals tell their kids to keep them from going out at night?

A number of reviews I've read of the movie have as their main criticism that it isn't actually a horror movie. Compared to most of today's horror films, especially in America, it's easy to understand why people might raise this as an issue. Even something like the first half of The Descent, which has as its main fear-inducer simple claustrophobia, has a grittier, scarier feel to it than The Evictors. This is much more an exercise in atmosphere, tension, and suspense than it is horror. I do not in any way consider that a bad thing; quite the opposite. This is a horror film for people who appreciate B&egrave;la Tarr and Krzyzstof Kieslowski movies. Better, then, to bring up some wooden actingthe more I see of Jessica Harper, the more I wonder why she continued getting roles in moviesand some set decoration that was kind of silly even for a zero-budget movie. (Just wait till you get a load of the neighbor's sitting room.) Still, despite problems, there is a great deal about The Evictors to like. ***",1416355200,,3010,4.479052823315119

1995699,5,B0001E7TL8,"I have just been able to acquire an off-brand DVD printing.  I loved the movie so much when i first rented it from a Video store that I bought my own copy (which I still have).  Many reviewers on web sites give this a low rating because they want more action and violence.  The lack of these along with less blood than usual in such movies really help the movie.  If one likes old houses and is tempted to explore seemingly abandoned ones in the country, this film is a godsend.  The house, barn, and grounds are well-chosen, as is restraint in the use of music.  My favorite atmospheric scene occurs in late afternoon when the wife has returned to the house alone and is putting books on shelves, with only some 1940-type song in the background.  We hear the fire in the fireplace crackling and then quiet, careful footsteps overhead.  When she goes into the hallway and looks up the stairwell, we see the late-afternoon sunlight on a hallway wall upstairs and then a man's head and hat shadow.  It is this kind of detail that makes the movie a rare experience--pure atmosphere, suspense, and isolation=terror.  Then the telephone rings, but she when whispers,her husband can't hear her, tells her he'll be late, and hangs up.",1414281600,,1227,4.612903225806452
1995700,3,B0001E7TL8,"Confusing at best. It seems the realtor (Vic Morrow) has a split personality. The writer/producer couldn't figure out whether to make him a good guy or bad. Also Ruth can't hit the broad side of a barn...unless or course it's someone she shouldn't shoot at and then her aim is 'dead' on. This was just a little bit corny but I stuck it out. Worth watching just once in honor of Vic, but once is quite enough.",1413590400,2,408,4.311688311688312

8011671,4,B0001E7TL8,"Scream Factorys BluRay releases this year have been hit-and-miss for me. Thankfully, after suffering through boring dreck like DEMENTED, they redeem themselves with THE EVICTORS, a stylish retro soft-thriller, that may bore the Millennials, will please fans of subtle, understated 70s psychological terror films. If nothing else, this film deserves points for being uniquely set in the 1940s. Seventies nostalgia was either Depression-Era or set in the 1950s I assume because the gloomy spectre of WWII still seemed too recent.

Released in 1979, in between the supernatural craze (THE EXORCIST, CARRIE, et al) and the Slasher Boom kicked off with FRIDAY THE 13th, THE EVICTORS has a lot going for it. Leading lady Jessica Harper has the look of a 1940s actress organically, without looking too stylized or made-up for the part. The hair and costumes and sets are not overdone so it does not remove the viewer from the film and one easily buys into the setting and period. The director adopts a less-is-more approach that works wonderfully so there is no gore here. It actually makes the film play more like an actual product of the 1940s than the 70s.

There are sepia-toned flashbacks that get progressively more gruesome which explain the tragic histories of a series of former tenants who lived in the house now occupied by Jessica and hard-working hubby Michael Parks. The opening flashback to 1928 contains clues to the climax of the film if you're paying attention and while I had a clue as to what was happening about the half-way mark, it didn't hamper my enjoyment of the film.

The Bluray quality is bright with vibrant colors though I did notice a couple of blemishes and white spots on the print at various times. If you like more thoughtful, sedate thrillers such as THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED, BURNT OFFERINGS or YOULL LIKE MY MOTHER, you will enjoy THE EVICTORS.",1501027200,,1875,4.927215189873418
