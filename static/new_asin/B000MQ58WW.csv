We shut the TV off several years ago due to the garbage being broadcast over the air these days.  I find it refreshing to watch The Waltons and pick up on things in my middle years that I missed as a child.  If you're not old enough to remember this show, I highly recommend that you purchase it, learn what good TV programming used to be all about, and then take action to send a message to the networks that you're no longer satisfied with the garbage they broadcast these days.",1198540800,5,587,4.3090909090909095
2738481,4,B000MQ58WW,"I am raising 3 boys and this is television that I don't mind them watching.  It shows family values and the fact that you can argue and disagree with each other but still remain a family.  Also, there isn't any content I think is unwatchable.  In this day and age, that is something I look for.  This is my kind of show!!!!!!",1178496000,21,325,4.193548387096774

8170685,5,B000MQ58WW,"What can you say about this series that hasn't been said.  They don't make them like this anymore, each episode is so satisfying that you want to watch more.  My husband and I have been going through the years and cherish each character in this series, each story, done to perfection.  This was also at a great price, so it's a win/win for sure. Treat yourself!",1343088000,,361,4.4393939393939394
8170686,5,B000MQ58WW,I love the Waltons!  The DVDs take you back in time and make you feel like you are part of the family.  Our family used to gather around the TV to watch each week when I was growing up.  Wish there were more good quality programs like these on telelvison today.  Kids don't get the good values with programs today that we did when we were growing up.,1245888000,3,350,4.102941176470588
