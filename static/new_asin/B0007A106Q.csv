2206873,5,B0007A106Q,"I recently received the Christopher Getz Ultimate Boxing 8 DVD Boxed Set and on first pass I am impressed. There is so much information it took me over a week just to view them all. I have over 40 pages of notes after watching just half of them. Getz is a very skilled and knowledgeable teacher who is never boring as he breaks down all the techniques and strategies in a way you can easily learn them. The lessons are very well structured and all DVDs compliment the others. Everything is covered from equipment to basic and advanced techniques so I must say this series offers a complete package on Boxing which is what I have been searching for and finally found with this set. The best thing is besides the physical routines, the lessons open your eyes as to how sophisticated and technical the sport of boxing really is. Boxing is a game of chess and to succeed Coach Getz teaches you to be a smart fighter as well as a fit fighter. The series is a total package with hundreds of techniques, tips and strategies that can make anyone who studies them a complete fighter. A++ Very good investment!",1107993600,39,1100,4.477611940298507

2206925,5,B0007A106Q,I finished 7 of those DVDS and one more to go.. they are great.. nothing is better.. I tried so many and browsed a lot on YouTube but Chris is a super trainer and I wish I can go to his gym one day..,1354406400,,199,3.5454545454545454
2206926,5,B0007A106Q,"Coach Chris Getz and his 8 d.v.d. box set on Boxing

A must have for anyone who wants to box. You can learn a lot from being at a Gym for sure, but you can also get lost in the shuffle.  Not so with these d.v.d.s)
With ultimate boxing lessons the drills, tips,and concepts are well explained. They are designed to teach the skills properly and creatively with each lesson building on the next.

Punches are taught and shown from every possible angle, the targets are explained, how to utilize each punch is explained. Footwork, bag work, counter punching, defensive techniques, focus mitts, ring strategy are taught and explained in a similar methodical fashion. Bonus material are the workouts and the adaptation of boxing techniques for self defense.
Methodical but fun. Boxing skills are skills, so they need some repetition to master. You will become a master if you follow the instruction.

Many drills can be done with a partner, but you can still learn quite a lot even if you do not have anyone to work with.
Chris is an excellent teacher, the video production is not flashy, not unlike other boxing videos I have seen. Still the shooting is good for two reasons, the camera person knows where to focus, and how to package the lesson.
 There is so much information in these videos bottom line.
Mr. Getz definitely loves to teach and this is plain to see in his presentations, he does not have any axe to grind or big ego. Even someone with two left feet will do well with his videos, he explains and teaches that well. Great for trainers as well. You will not be sorry if you get the box set!",1317254400,10,1600,4.541666666666667
2206927,5,B0007A106Q,"I am really glad i purchased this DVD set, it contains so much information you need to know about boxing.  it's a great value.",1270425600,2,126,4.25
2206928,5,B0007A106Q,"Coach Getz gives us the inside scoop on what it takes to be a well-rounded, complete boxer.  If you want fancy graphics, loud music, and a lot of tough-guy talk, then look elsewhere.  But if you want solid, detailed information about boxing in all its aspects, then this is the instructional series for you.

If every boxing trainer was as articulate and thoughtful as Christopher Getz, boxers would not develop the glaring technique deficiencies that we see in so many fighters.  Coach Getz's step by step approach leaves nothing to chance.  If you take his lessons to heart, you'll reach your full potential.

In the review of this product at heavyfists dot com, you can read a description of the contents of each disk.  Also, you can view a 10 minute sample video cut from the first DVD entitled ""fundamentals"".  In the sample, coach Getz presents part of his left hook lesson.

I highly recommend this series; other than Kenny Weldon's fine series of introductory lessons, this one stands alone.",1258588800,4,999,4.829411764705882
2206929,5,B0007A106Q,"I ordered this series and was a little concerned by all the comments about it being ""low production quality"". I was pleasantly suprised to find out the production quality on this series is WAYYYY better than every other boxing dvd instruction video i've bought. It's really very nice. The guy speaks very well and clear and it's obvious he's a very intelligent and knowledgeable guy when it comes to boxing.

Now this isn't some million dollar slickly produced hollywood video........but most of those i've bought when it came to sports instruction, sucked anyway.

For it's purpose and content, it is outstanding. By far the best Boxing series i've bought. The price is a bit steep, but well wort it.

And the best part, this series is literally packed with information from beginning to end. And he starts with the basic fundamentals and builds on that.

5 stars all the way on this series.",1257206400,8,892,4.810457516339869
2206930,5,B0007A106Q,"This is a great instructional set, for sure the best one out there.

There are tons of great MMA and Jiu-Jitsu instructionals available but Boxing seems to be few and far between.  This set has some great tips to polish up your basics but also some ring strategy and a lot of drills to improve your footwork and punching ability.

If you are looking to learn some new tricks and accelerate your learning curve this instructional is for sure worth the money.",1243728000,5,457,4.548780487804878
2206931,4,B0007A106Q,"As noted by other reviewers, the production values are not that great for a  set this expensive, but the instruction and drills are priceless.  Christopher Getz provides comprehensive instruction in boxing with HEAVY emphasis on fundamentals throughout.  The breakdowns for movement, punches, combinations and defense are solid and well taught.  Each volume in the 8 DVD set builds from the previous one, so I highly recommend the full set over the individual volumes.

The lessons themselves are top notch and worth 5 stars.  Amateur DVD production knocks it down to 4.",1201132800,14,570,5.208791208791209
2206932,5,B0007A106Q,"I just received the 8 DVD set and have watched a few of the DVD's.

I am very happy and impressed by the quality of instruction and the depth of instruction.

This is a great DVD set for learning boxing from the ground up. I can highly recommend!

As other posts have noted, the production quality is low. That is, it does not have the feel of being filmed by a professional editor or film crew. But thats ok, I wasn't buying it for that reason. I was looking for excellent instruction and thats just what I got.

I am very satisfied with this purchase.",1180742400,9,553,4.238095238095238
2206933,5,B0007A106Q,"The production values are not like those of The Lord of the Rings movies, but the picture and sound are clear enough, and the content is excellent.  Getz explains all the facets of boxing thoroughly, and everything is illustrated with excellent analogies (useful when you're in the ring and can only remember a few key points) and demonstrations.  He is particularly good on the mechanics of footwork and punching.  Absolutely worth the money.",1149033600,10,443,5.041095890410959
8046470,5,B0007A106Q,"Watching the DVDs feels like I'm in boxing college or something.  Instructor reminds me of Freddie Roach,  very knowledgeable.  But it's not enough to watch the video, you have to put what you learn into practice.  Would recommend this if you want to learn how to box.",1523923200,,268,4.638297872340425
8046471,1,B0007A106Q,"I would give less if i could,only one disc out of the whole set played. For the price,you would expect much better effort to mke a product that worked. Before you say it yes i bought US format,and yes I have made sure to test several other dvds to make sure it wasent the player but this set,what a total ripoff and shoddy product. And what i bought fot 100$ is now 129.00 .This man has nerve! No wonder he boxes,being as he does people like this,i imagine hes had to fight more than once!",1521849600,,489,4.157894736842105
8046472,5,B0007A106Q,"I have purchased and watched/read several books and DVDs on fighting, boxing, and martial arts. This DVD set is the best source for Boxing instruction that I have come across. The instructor breaks everything down with clear instruction including both techniques and strategy. If you want to learn how to box or want a supplement to your gym work, I highly recommend this.",1516579200,,372,4.920634920634921
8046473,5,B0007A106Q,"Don't be deterred by the reviews that say it's poor quality video. It's not blueray but it's not some cheap home video either. What really matters is that this is an amazing instructional DVD set on boxing! I love combat sports and wanted so bad to understand all the finer points of footwork, how to throw various punches, counters, etc. I barely watched two DVDs so far and I can spot all kinds of techniques and movements while watching boxing, and even in mma and kickboxing I can see it as well. I just got it for that purpose but it is so good that I put on my gloves and tried some of the punching techniques on a Wavemaster. I was blowing that thing away, where as before watching these videos I was just kind of hitting hard and making my arms really sore from bad technique. I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who wants to learn to box or even just understand the ""sweet science"" better! It is worth every penny!",1484870400,,929,4.314285714285714
8046474,5,B0007A106Q,"These are the best teaching DVDs I've ever seen. I highly recommend in addition to training in a gym hopefully by an experienced coach.
I do not know Christopher Getz. My endorsement is pure.",1478822400,,191,4.647058823529412
8046475,5,B0007A106Q,"Great instructional videos. Well done, to the point accurate and most of all practical.
I'm glad I bought it, it has already changed my sparring.",1470268800,,145,4.84
8046476,5,B0007A106Q,As others have mentioned the films quality is slacking but not bad. The information is priceless and the attention to detail in fundamentals are superb,1436313600,,151,5.08
8046477,5,B0007A106Q,"I know nothing about boxing other than watching it on TV once in awhile. I signed my 9 yo son up for boxing. I wanted him to learn the fundamentals correctly & not depend solely on a local guy who may or may not know techniques as well or who even if he knew the techniques might not be interested in paying such close attention to my son. I got this video to understand & help my son because of this. The lessons are perfect. Very in depth on details. I now understand stance, movement, how each punch should be thrown, how to generate power, how to defend, throw combos, counter, etc. Extremely well done. I own about 70 wrestling dvds & 50 jiu jitsu dvds, I know garbage when I see it and greatness when I do. This dvd is full of great things, well thought out awesome lessons. I have no regret spending the money on this series. If I lost these dvds I'd have to buy them again.",1431043200,6,881,4.157894736842105
8046478,5,B0007A106Q,"I bought this DVD set about 2 years ago and although I was slow in giving a review I was extremely satisfied with the purchase and product. IMO, the Chris Getz Ultimate Boxing Lessons set is an absolute must-have for any student, or practitioner of boxing. This set would have been a deal at three times the price for the amount of content and knowledge that is given. It can be used for many different drills and skills and it has helped me to learn, teach and stay physically fit and mentally motivated with boxing.

By the time I got thru with the Punch Combinations dvd, I felt like a pro and my wife was very impressed when she saw my new found skills. This DVD set has really helped to open my eyes and mind, especially to the intricacies and subtle nuances used by many professional boxers. It has allowed me to now recognise and understand the effective defensive and offensive approaches and techniques that work best for successful boxers.

In short, I'd like to thank the reviewer on Heavyfists.com for his excellent review which linked to Amazon.com and the Ultimate Boxing Lessons DVD set. It was described on Heavyfists as 'Boxing lessons from A to Z -- The best boxing training DVD series'.

Here is a small part of the Heavyfists.com review.....""Chris Getz gives away the farm in this boxing training DVD series. The wealth of information packed into these DVDs could have been broken up and made into more than 8 videos. I get the impression that this was a labor of love rather than a cynical money-making scheme.""

After reading that review, I was intrigued enough to see the reviews on Amazon and then buy it.

Now, after purchasing and using the set - I strongly agree!",1377561600,7,1690,4.601328903654485
8046479,5,B0007A106Q,"Chris Getz's boxing lessons is one of the best videos I've ever purchased. He covers the fundamentals from every camera angle, so you have a clear understanding of boxing's fundamentals. Whether you're just trying to learn the basics or have aspirations as a pro boxer, there's no doubt you'll geta lot out of these videos.",1363910400,2,323,4.890909090909091
