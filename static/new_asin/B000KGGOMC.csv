Shmuley has a way about him that ingratiates the family to him so that they canm wutg gus guidance, heal themselves.  I have since purchased the book which has these and more stories which are also thought provoking.",1322438400,,352,4.9491525423728815
8156826,4,B000KGGOMC,"If you are a fan of Rabbi Shmuley and his teachings, you'll very likely enjoy Shalom in the Home. Rabbi Shmuley offers ancient Jewish principles to non-Jews who are struggling with various issues. His approach is firm, yet non-judgmental.

I've seen similar reality shows on TV but didn't like any of them nearly as much as this one. Rabbi Shmuley doesn't come off as arrogant and doesn't talk to folks like they're stupid. He also does far a better job, in my opinion, of getting to the heart of the matter.  It's not just about fixing the symptom, but the root cause.  His wisdom isn't some current fad among self-help folks (but nothing against them), but rather ancient Jewish wisdom dating back thousands of years.

This episode is about a husband who cheated on his wife and was thrown out of their home as a result. Rabbi Shmuley goes back to the basics of the man's life to see how this happened in the first place. Why did he feel the need to do such a thing in the first place? Why did he need an affair in order to feel good about himself? Why couldn't he see himself as a hero, by simply being a good father and faithful husband?  Let's face it; television has played a big role in ruining the image of the father.  It's hard to consider yourself a hero for going to work and helping your kids with homework.  You'll rarely ever see ""heroes"" like that on television.  I'm glad to see TLC is helping to restore that image.

My only complaint, and it's a BIG one, is the price.  I was going to give it only 3 stars because of the price, but I wasn't sure if it was fair to the blame the show. The show is 5 stars, but the price is 2 or 3.  Each DVD only has 1 episode and is priced at approximately $20.  With that in mind, I'll rate this item at 4 stars.  If anyone knows where to find these cheaper, PLEASE let me know.",1283126400,,1831,4.227011494252873
