3597478,5,B001G7ICZ6,"Okay, small quibble first:  For whatever reason, the picture size on the last disk only wouldn't self-adjust to fit my TV screen from top to bottom, so I had to change the aspect ratio to 4:3.  That made everything fit, but it looked like I was watching a show formatted for an old tube TV on a wide-screen (lots of black to the left and right).  I would dock the set half a star if Amazon had half star increments in its rating system.
That said, the technical glitch detracts not a bit from what got me hooked on Inuyasha while watching it on Adult Swim--an engrossing story full of heroism and fully developed characters that grow and change.  If you followed the whole series, you will agree that the episode ""3000 Leagues in Search of Father,"" is a tear-jerker in the best sense of the phrase.  I check Amazon almost daily to see if Season 7 is available, and hope further that Sunrise will commit the rest of the manga to anime.  Inuyasha is a work of art that is orders of magnitude better than the crap movies and TV series that are churned out and inflicted on an innocent public.  Long live Inuyasha!",1229212800,,1110,4.385365853658537

These repackages are literally the same products and episodes, just condensed in terms of packaging and price.

Standard definition - so 4:3 ratio with obvious static and other SD flaws, but that's cool. There isn't much you can do when upconverting an original SD work.

There are Bluray discs of the final act and the movies, but that is probably all there will ever be.

Japanese Audio with English subs is indeed available on these discs.",1438992000,3,545,4.705263157894737

I tried all the dvd players in the house and It still would not play. but the weird part is that the disk was brand new (never been used) and had no scratches on it?! so I am just really dissapointed because this isn't the first time this has happened to me.",1340323200,2,1019,3.9038461538461537

3597561,5,B001G7ICZ6,"I for one don't like a lot of anime; but only have a select few favorites... one being Inuyasha. That is because I like Inuyasha for it's unique story and great cast of characters; not to mention the style and genre the anime fits into my personallity!

I mean they don't call this show a fuedal fairy tale for nothing you know! That's why I love it so much; it has lots of sword swinging action in fuedal Japan, romance between the 3 key characters Inuyasha, Kikyo, & Kagome, and a bunch of LOL comedy with the other characters!

Season 6 of Inuyasha is especially great; and there are some episodes that make it so great! My favorite episodes include Hakudoshi unleashing Entei the horse, Miroku banquet to his master, Miroku proposing to Sango, Seesshomaru saving the otter boy's father, and many others!

Plus I think it's just great to have the entire Inuyasha Seasons on DVD; since you don't have to worry about having them recorded on your old VHS tapes! That is because I'm a collector; & I love having DVD's of all of my favorite shows & movies!",1247702400,2,1054,4.507853403141361
3597562,3,B001G7ICZ6,"The Inuyasha Sixth Season Box Set includes four DVDs, which contain twenty of the episodes from the sixth season of the anime.  The first three discs contain five episodes, and the fourth disc includes five episodes and the special features.

Disc four contains three special features.  The first feature is a ""Textless Opening,"" which is essentially the opening that appears at the beginning of each episode, but this version doesn't have the text that covers the pictures.  The second feature is a ""Textless Ending,"" which is the ending credits without the text covering the pictures.  I was very surprised and pleased by the new ending credits song that appears in the sixth season.  The song was much more electronic-based than the other themes (which have been more rock-based).

The third special feature in the set is labeled as, ""Inuyasha Special Footage - Down the Well: Inside the Feudal Fairytale.""  This feature runs for almost eight minutes, and utilizes the English dub actors, as well as the English dub versions of the Inuyasha footage.  Over the course of the piece, the characters of Myoga and Totosai are giving some explanations about Japan's feudal era.  They talk about what the feudal era was like, they explain what yokai are, and also talk about the religious figures of the time (humans who have spiritual powers).  Unfortunately, it felt more like the voice actors were reading straight out of Wikipedia entries, rather than the piece being written to truly educate the viewer.  On the other sets, the ""Inuyasha Special Footage"" was originally produced in Japan, and subtitled for the American DVD releases.  Personally, I like the Japanese ""Inuyasha Special Footage"" pieces better than the one that appears on this set.

This box set of Inuyasha includes a combination of short story-arcs and stand alone episodes.  However, very few episodes in the set felt like filler material.  It felt like almost all of the episodes were important for progressing the story.

If you're a fan of Inuyasha and want to have all of the episodes on DVD, then you need to acquire this set.",1245110400,5,2100,4.97134670487106

3597564,5,B001G7ICZ6,"Inuyasha season 6 best one so far. Well almost best one, I love all of Inuyasha and I have all the box sets that have been put out. So saying season 6 is the best might be pushing it because, for me they all are the best. Season 6 is getting into good parts of the show. Don't want tell you to much but I think if you are a Inuyasha fan like me then you will love season 6 as much as I did.",1233532800,,390,3.6

3597566,4,B001G7ICZ6,"I just got this package in the mail recently, and I really like this.  The episodes are funny and there aren't many fillers (so there shouldn't be many complaints).  For the price, it's definitely worth every single cent you pay!",1231545600,,229,4.7
3597567,4,B001G7ICZ6,I bought this item at walmart for $30 and the item is great i would order other seasons off this site if they were cheaper.,1230768000,,123,3.96
3597568,5,B001G7ICZ6,"I started watching InuYasha because one morning I woke up at 5:30 with an upset stomach. After watching that episode (one of the Band of Seven episodes) I was hooked! The price on this set is PHENOMINAL!! Because I bought this, I get to sleep in for a few mornings, because on Adult Swim they are about 6 episodes behind where this box set ends.

On the back of the box it said the next set would have up to Episode 164 on it. There are 167 Episodes (because I have the last episode on an individually purchased DVD) I wonder why they are cutting the last set off early...?

That said... I now own ALL four movies, and Box sets 1 through 6. I must have spent 400.00 on these things, and I wish i would have checked Amazon sooner.. i may have only spend 200! InuYasha was well worth the money, even if no one else i know watches it!!

I also love how the box spines of all these box sets have images of the Shikon Jewel becoming whole/tained, just like in the story line!",1229731200,,970,4.148936170212766

8304270,5,B001G7ICZ6,Wonderful season as always well written and it has a GREAT story to it. It leaves you with a cliffhanger that will leave you asking yourself what will happen next? I bought the next season as soon as I finished this one. Your bound to love each and every second of this show without a doubt. I highly recommend buying all of the seasons of this show.,1515110400,,350,4.2388059701492535
