6701788,5,B00O20UNM4,"Pay 2 Play isn't your standard political film. It interweaves stories about Monopoly, underdog candidates, not so well known political scandals involving huge amounts of money and even street art to show exactly how and why our system is the way it is. If you've wondered how our political system has become beholden to the huge corporate donors and the very rich and controlled by it, then you should see this film. It explores the history of money in politics, how it relates to the game Monopoly, history of Supreme Court decisions such as Citizens United to Hobby Lobby, and many of the various movements that people are involved in to try to regain balance in our country.  It really ties all of these seemingly separate things together in a way I haven't really seen before.

Pay 2 Play shows us hope in several solutions we can get involved in now to turn the tide for We The People! It will both entertain you and show you what is going on in our political system deep beneath the surface of your TV.",1412812800,3,1008,4.532967032967033
6701789,5,B00O20UNM4,"Driven to make the world a better place for his newborn daughter, filmmaker John Ennis looks for ways outsiders can lead when our country is run by insiders and pay-to-play politics. He journeys through high drama on the Ohio campaign trail, uncovers the secret history of Americas past time, and explores the underworld of L.A. street art on a humorous odyssey that reveals how much of a difference one person can make.

From billionaires meeting in secret to citizens taking to the streets, PAY 2 PLAY follows the money and connects the dots in this powerful and well executed portrait of People Power rising that features a host of well positioned, well spoken and wonderfully creative people including Robert Reich, Marianne Williamson, Noam Chomsky, Jerry Springer and many more.

6701791,1,B00O20UNM4,"I had to stop watching this film after 30 minutes because it was obviously a political statement as opposed to a real commentary on how both parties participate in paying for political access and favors.  It was presented as if only evil Republicans were involved when it is so obvious that there is no party affiliation that attracts money so fervently.  The amount of public deception has no dominance over political affiliation since the majority of our politicians are for sale, regardless of party.  Nice try, but this film is entirely BS.  I say this as an independent.",1424390400,7,575,4.836734693877551

6701793,5,B00O20UNM4,"John Wellington Ennis presents a compelling documentary that is a MUST vs. a ""should"" see, thought provoking film pertaining to the fact we the people are not served by our employess, that being our elected officials.

the film not only brilliantly lays out in easy to understand ways how the system is not only rigged as well as corrupt but SIX steps we the people can implement to begin to reclaim a gvoernment of the people, by the people, and FOR the people.

please host a house party and educate the electorate. then,  VOTE!

thank you to each and everyone of you who contributed to the making of this film.",1419724800,,613,4.545454545454546
6701794,5,B00O20UNM4,"Ennis takes the viewer on a journey to discover the truth behind the current American system of election campaigning, and the consequences that entails for us ""Washington outsiders."" Exploring Citizens United, Corporate Personhood, Hobby Lobby, ALEC (American Legislative Exchange Council), the Koch Bothers, and more, Ennis gives a detailed background to influential cases and actors that have made this disaster possible. By interviewing professors, lawyers, constitutional scholars, and the like, Ennis provides a nuanced analysis of how this problem is affecting us, what it means for our political system, and what we can do.

Ennis suggests the danger and repercussions of giving corporations these rights through analysis by professors, lawyers, and scholars across the country, including Noam Chomsky, Robert Reich, John Nichols, and Marge Baker, among others. These intellectuals give light to several realities for how our political system is broken (or `fixed').

Ennis is able to maintain a captivating experience for his audience by outlining the power of the people to fix this `fixed' system. Through street art, protesting, and other forms of self-expression, the film encourages people to ignite change. Ennis compares this political game to the game of Monopoly (having its own legal skepticism), which he believes embodies the reality of the current corporate overtaking. After following two congressional candidates on their path to using voter funds, rather than corporate funds, and watching their campaigns come short to a corporate-backed constituent, Ennis' film channels rage into hope.

""Pay 2 Play"" is nothing short of inspiring, empowering, and encouraging. Whether it is protesting, creating art on the street, or making films about money in politics, Ennis motivates people to believe that we all can make a difference- every single one of us.",1416268800,2,1874,5.591549295774648
6701795,5,B00O20UNM4,"Between corporate money, billionaire donors, and partisan politics, how can an underdog candidate compete? The reality is that he can't, as we clearly learn in Pay 2 Play. We watch director John Ennis follow such candidates, eschewing corporate contributions in favor of clean campaigns, and watch how they flounder in the face of massive, intimidating spending by their opponents and dark money. Ennis's film does an excellent job of explaining how money in politics is radically changing the face of American elections, combining the work of scholars, activists, and artists to tell the tale of a system that isn't broken... it's fixed.",1416268800,6,638,5.264705882352941
6701796,5,B00O20UNM4,"Pay 2 Play harks back to the very best activist political documentaries of the 2000s, from the likes of Robert Greenwald, Michael Moore and Greg Palast. John Ennis makes the issue of corporate and billionaire money having taken over political elections relevant for the rest of us, and even suggests that we might be able to do something about it. Vital for anyone who wants to understand the American political process. Highly Recommended.",1414108800,2,440,5.041095890410959
6701797,5,B00O20UNM4,"After watching director John Ennis's first political film, Free For ALL several year ago I was thrilled to experience his latest piece Pay2Play in the theaters this season. Pay 2 Play offers incredible insight to the way money filters through our government, specifically focusing on how it grossly affects our electoral process.

It's funny, it's sexy, arty and informative even for those who have their thumb on the pulse of politics... Which I certainly don't but it seems everyone walks away learning and inspired for active change. You will laugh a lot, cry a little and be grateful this film is finally being made... you will simply want to share it with everyone you know and with elections coming up soon the opportunity for change could not be more ripe!

Thank you John and all those who helped bring this film into being.

I have been wondering what I can do to help with all the unbelievably devastating things that are happening in the word -- from environmental issues to our commercial food, health and political systems.
