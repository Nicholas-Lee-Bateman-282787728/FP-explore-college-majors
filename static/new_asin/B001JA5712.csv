8498652,2,B001JA5712,"I am learning mogul skiing and have decided to buy books and videos to help me learn. I purchased this video hoping to have useful lessons to apply on the slopes. This video is not helpful. The instructors are good old boy types who can ski well, but who lack the analytical skills to break down what is happening in mogul skiing. They preach the notion that mogul skiing is just like carving, the same skill set. It is clear, from a far superior product that I also purchased, ""Skiing Skills: Mastering Moguls"" that their teaching skills fall tremendously short. The skills used in mogul skiing are very different from carving skills. The book, ""Everything the Instructors Never Told You About Mogul Skiing"" supports the analysis provided in the better video, ""Skiing Skills: Mastering Moguls."" It is clear that skidding skills are necessary, yet there is no mention of that skill in this video. In short, this is a video that will teach you very little, there are better products available. I gave it two stars because I like to watch people ski moguls, and at least it contains a fair amount of that.",1278633600,,1103,4.690721649484536
