8568362,4,B00BH2XTBM,"This is a good barre pilates routine, if you like barre or Pilates you will probably like this one the only thing I did not like is the according to the description of this dvd I thought I was getting a 60 minutes routine plus a 10 minutes bonus segment and it is only a 37 minutes routine that includes warm up and cool down and a 10 minutes separate butt routine so you will be getting a 47 workout including the bonus segment.  The work out is pretty good and I enjoyed it, is probably beginners to intermediate intensity.",1393027200,,525,4.25
8568363,5,B00BH2XTBM,Excellent workout. A very intense workout in a quiet sort of way. I defintely felt like I had worked my muscles the following day. This is a workout where you can progress at your own pace.,1384732800,,189,4.277777777777778
