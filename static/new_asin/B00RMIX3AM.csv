8695557,2,B00RMIX3AM,"I can't in good conscience give Alpha's DVD more than two stars when there's a far superior transfer of the main attraction included as a bonus feature on Kino's 2002 ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" DVD. That version includes the original tints, and the image quality blows this fuzzy b&w picture out of the water. There are shots in this one where Genuine's face doesn't even register, which is unacceptable, since Fern Andra's wild facial acting and exotic looks are a major highlight of the film.

Be warned that the immaculate, attractively tinted pictures on the back of the case are production stills, NOT screen grabs from the disc. This transfer doesn't come anywhere near that level of detail.

Is there anything to recommend this DVD? Yes. The bonus short---the avant-garde, 13-minute ""Fall of the House of Usher"" from 1928---looks pretty great. What with its largely abstract imagery and inherently contrasty aesthetic, it's hard to be sure, but to me it looks like a 16mm print that's in very good shape and has gotten a quite solid transfer. It looks better here than anywhere on YouTube.

Plus there's that eye-catching cover design, a reproduction of the original poster art. Since the ""Caligari"" DVD has been surpassed by the Blu-ray (which unfortunately does not include ""Genuine"" in any form), but I still had it lying around, I ordered this DVD and cobbled together a two-disc set from a spare 2-disc DVD case, the sleeve of the Alpha release, the Kino ""Caligari"" disc (for ""Genuine""), and the Alpha ""Genuine"" disc (for ""Usher""). For a disc that cost under $5, the extra legwork was no biggie.

It would be remiss of me not to mention that both the Alpha and the Kino disc present ""Genuine"" in its brutally abridged 44-minute form. The original cut, which I understand DOES survive today, runs 88 minutes and has not yet been seen on Region 1 home video. The gist of the story comes through here to some extent, but one can definitely feel one is missing a lot of story detail and emotional beats. Perhaps someday...",1500422400,3,2029,4.80515759312321
8695558,3,B00RMIX3AM,"It's not ok but I don't dislike it.  It's not up to the standards of ""The Cabinet  of dr. Calgary"" (1919). the script was not well thought out. The direction was bad forcing the actors to overstate their feelings; but the sets and Genuine's costumes are imaginative although also overstated. Still there is so few German Expressionist films available, one would, no doubt, want to add this to their collection.",1478217600,,410,4.8428571428571425
