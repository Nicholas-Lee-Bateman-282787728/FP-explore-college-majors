My very conservative pastor uncle was insulted by the natives' lack of clothing, but nothing is shown and I find it quite tasteful.  They are island people!  It's hot!  Come on.  Your kids are going to be too mesmerized by the scenery and the story to notice.",1354406400,,422,4.415584415584416
7912092,4,B00000JGF4,"The 7th video in the series is set at Christmas time on the island. Johanna is given the treasure map that belonged to Raven Jones and sets off in search of the treasure, however danger lies in wait for her and also for her Mother. This video has a little of everything in it. Danger, romance, mystery and the return of the pirates combine for an exciting visit to the Island. This one is one of my favourites. The scenery as ever is beautiful and it is well acted. I would highly recommend it for those who have enjoyed other videos in the series!",984700800,,548,4.278846153846154
