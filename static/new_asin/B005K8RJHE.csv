8476545,1,B005K8RJHE,this film sucks. There is no story here just someone who wanted you to hear the choir sing. A total waste of my time.,1346112000,2,117,3.9166666666666665
8476546,1,B005K8RJHE,"Basically The Pastor's Secret jumps from one scene to another.  I could not really get any understanding of the plot at all.  There is just a lot to be desired for this movie to be called a CHRISITIAN FILM. The language used to tear down one of the female characters was OUTRAGEOUS in my opinion.

Personally I say don't waste your money buying the movie. I would not recommend the Pastor's Secret. This movie was thrown in the trash, total waste of my money.",1344643200,2,459,4.440476190476191
