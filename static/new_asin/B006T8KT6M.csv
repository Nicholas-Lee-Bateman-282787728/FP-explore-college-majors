5015967,5,B006T8KT6M,"Great DTS-HD Master Sound, and picture, Santana's classic hits on this Blu-ray are a must have for any fan of Santana.  I could live without the first three songs on this disc, (in my opinion a questionable start of this concert).  However, the rest of the concert and the Bass and Drum solo with Santana's wife on the drums is a real treat for your ears.",1330819200,2,355,4.363636363636363
5015968,1,B006T8KT6M,"I consider myself a life long Santana fan having been one since Santana's first album came out but what he has done to these songs is just plain WRONG.  And if you are a true Santana fan, you know this is true. I have been a drummer over 30 years and I owe my interest in drums to the Santana Band and their very first album.  First of all, what's with the horns?  The horns he used on Santana III were cool but ever since Supernatural came out they add absolutely nothing to the Santana ""sound"".  They make the songs sound like cheap imitations of the originals.  And what's with the ""movie"" musical interludes on some of the songs?  I want to hear the songs they way they should go, they don't have to be note per note but....I don't need any Clint Eastwood movie music, etc music in your show.  Black Magic Woman, Open Invitation, etc ARE NOT DUETS!!!!!  Tony Lindsay is the ONLY lead vocalist that should be on that stage.  He is a true vocalist and is the best singer you have had since Alex Ligertwood.  I mean listen to him...he always sings like it's going to be his swan song.  And last I remember wasn't Open Invitation a rock tune???  Couldn't tell by this concert.  The Santana band I remember didn't need guest musicians or singers to play on their albums much less their concerts.  The percussion section gets drowned out by guess who....the percussion.  Raul has the right idea....congas, maybe a gong.  Karl, all you need is a set of timbales,  couple of cowbells, cymbals, maybe a few effects.  That's all ""Chepito"" and Orestes Vilato needed.  It's all about quality, not quantity.  Hell, I am going to confuse your setup with Terry Bozzio's setup.  Let's see how many different percussion instruments I can fit into this song or how many times I can hit some percussion intrument in this song....WRONG!!!  I believe these are some of the reasons why Chester Thompson, who is dearly missed, left the band as well as other Santana mainstays.  Dennis Chambers...you are incredible, (Brecker Bros, etc), but you are wasting your time and energy here.  Other than your solos, if I was blindfolded, I wouldn't know you were the drummer in this band.  The songs Santana has come out with the past 10 years or so just don't have any originality left in them.  It pains me to write this stuff but Santana hasn't been Santana for a long time.  Please, Carlos, for your life long fans, give us one more ""SANTANA"" album before it's too late.  I know that even from ""Santana 1"", many your songs weren't originals, but you made them your own...like Jungle Strut (Santana III) originally done by Gene Ammons (sax man).  Didn't you once criticize Herb Alpert, in an interview, for being a sellout????  GOT A MIRROR????  I realize Clive has made you more money from Supernatural than you have ever see and I guess that's the bottom line.  I miss the real Santana.  Shrieve, Chepito, Rolie, Carabello, Coster, Thompson, Lear, Ligertwood, Vilato, Peraza.....HELP!!!!!!!!",1330646400,122,2969,4.658959537572255
5015969,1,B006T8KT6M,"Santana please hang the glove, my friend, the Che Guevara and pot mixture is screwing your brain, the originality went out off the window in this performance...Salsa? Timba? WTF is that? If you like that crap, then, that is for you, for me it is not, and trust me that I grew up in the country of salsa, Cuba. This is just plain wrong, Back in Black in rap? Where is CT, and the rest? Andy is just a walking tattooed newspaper clown, period...Why the need of this ridiculous brass section, what for? You are one of the best guitarist of the moment now, why the need of that crap!!!! Latin percussion is one thing, like Dimeola uses it, but another thing is turning your music into a freaking salsa concert...Sorry guys but this is just plain wrong, the first 8-10 songs are just crap....Tedeschi and Trucks, why you accepted to play in such a lame band??? Denis, please stop, go and keep on playing with CAB, Stern, Niacin, or whomever you can find, but this is not a place in which you can shine anymore!!! Leave that new wife take the skins in Santana new band...That BTW in my humble opinion is nothing to write home about...Sorry Cindy, keep on drinking natural home made juices, and you will be a real good chef, but a good drummer is another story...sorry!!!!",1330041600,12,1265,4.48051948051948
5015970,4,B006T8KT6M,"I was worried when I first started to watch this BD..
It started with a Rap something and I was ready to return it.
I hung with it though and really enjoyed the music.
I recommend you watch the Carlos Santana interview first.
I think it will enhance your viewing pleasure. I watched
the interview after the concert. It's a great insight into Santana.",1329955200,3,350,4.484375
5015971,5,B006T8KT6M,if you are a santana OMG listener this dvd is a must carlos is all that he is. You would think your at the concert i don't buy cds any more when you got the best of both worlds A+A+A+A+A+A+,1329782400,8,189,3.75
5015972,5,B006T8KT6M,"I was first turned on to Santana as a 12 year kid in 1971.  I heard Black Magic Woman on the radio and was hooked.  Later that year, I received the Santana III album for Christmas.  I wore the thing out!  I've been following Carlos Santana's career for almost 41 years since those days.

I was ecstatic when I received my copy of Santana Live At Montreux - especially when I saw that it had all the tunes that made me a fan of the Woodstock veteran and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 1998 inductee.  I've watched and love Carlos' other DVD's but I must say that Live in Montreux is, by (and so) far, my favorite.

Filmed in high-definition and recorded in DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby Digital 5.1 and LPCM Stereo, the 2-DVD set is a virtual treasure chest contained in a 23-song show lasting over three hours.  The show was filmed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in beautiful Montreux, Switzerland, a place as timeless as Santana's music performed on these discs.  As Santana says in the interview contained within the set's Bonus Features, the venue and festival is ""the concert concerts"".  Watching the video only rekindled my desire to again visit the beautiful city on ""the Lake Geneva shoreline"" (to quote Deep Purple).

In addition to Santana and his incredibly tight band serving up crowd favorites as only he (and they) can, he infuses his performance with riffs from iconic songs from the day.  To me, it symbolizes not only how interwoven the music is into the soundtrack of our minds and youth, but also just how intertwined Carlos is into the musical fabric of society.

The aforementioned interview with Carlos is spectacular. Chris Cowey asks many of the same kinds of questions that I would ask.  Cowey also superbly interviews Carlos' wife, Cindy Blackman Santana (whose intense drum solo featured in the show will leave your mouth gaping long after she's finished).  As an interviewer, I would buy the discs just for the interviews but that's just how I am.

A very special treat in the form of the husband/wife team of Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks as they add their skills to Make Somebody Happy/Right On Be Free.  Wow!  Do they ever tear it up!  In addition to Cindy Blackman Santana's incredible drum solo, there is also an awesome display of skin bounding by Carlos' drummer, Dennis Chambers.  I could watch those two drum solos all day long.

While each cut on these two discs are worth buying the set over, Boomerocity favorites are:  Open Invitation, Samb Pa Ti, and Carlos' interpretation of the Cream hit, Sunshine of Your Love that was covered on Santana's Guitar Heaven CD.

I highly recommend this concert DVD to hard core Santana fans, rock fans in general as well as serious musicians. I also recommend visiting the beautiful city of Montreux if you ever get the chance.  Its beauty and history will impact your life just as Santana's music has and does.

I would recommend this for both casual fans and long-time established fans.  I've seen Santana several times and this is almost as enjoyable as seeing him live.  Now that I'm older, I am a little more selective about going to concerts.  These ""high quality"" blu-rays make great souvenirs and cut down dramatically on the inconveniences of today's concert industry.  This was a lot better than dealing with the crowds, traffic, over-priced tickets and concessions, and no one cares if I watch in my underwear.  A+++",1482883200,2,628,5.088235294117647

5015980,5,B006T8KT6M,"Carlos Santana has a legacy he can easily be proud of. I've always greatly respected his work, and he continues to recruit and promote younger musicians, which I see as a positive. Added to that, the production quality of this release is stunning. Superb video, well-shot technically, and the sound is jaw-dropping. It's really hard to find live concert video of this quality, and this is currently my top pick as a demonstration disc for my new Klipsch/Yamaha Atmos system. One of the best rock concert videos ever. Additionally, the concert is musically interesting, as the band drifts over into a jazz sound pretty regularly --- lots of improvisation, and the sound of every instrument is crystal clear, with great surround separation. If you have any interest in what Santana does, then you don't want to miss this one.",1475884800,,823,4.928057553956834

5015986,5,B006T8KT6M,"Very outstanding performance by Carlos Santana and his band! This live performance recording sounded very much like a studio recording, but it is absolutely live. The best I've seen of Santana. The video and audio are top notch. What I really also appreciated is that the crowd cheering and outside noise was kept to a minimum so I could hear the band vocals and instruments quite vividly which is very unlike other recorded live concerts I've watched.

5015989,5,B006T8KT6M,"This is the rare opportunity to watch a legend filmed more recently in HD type format with excellent editing.  Typically, performances from the 70-80s are marred by picture and sound quality and editing is unsteady and often random.  Santana has been around so long that we have the rare chance to see him in an exciting more recent video.  The band is simply extraordinary!!!  The new lead singers are impassioned and exciting.
This one is great.  Ignore cuts 1-3 which are warm up.  Get desert, a beer or a glass of wine.  Settle back as Maria, maria takes you away and the band sustains it for hours!",1456617600,5,603,4.579439252336448

5016016,5,B006T8KT6M,"An album like Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon was recorded mostly as a medley of songs, one flowing into the other. And so the concert going audience has come to expect live execution that is close to the studio recording. Not so with Carlos Santana's greatest hits. Thus it's fine with me that Live At Montreux includes a brass section and even rappers for an extended performance, and also for variety.

The Master DTS audio of this concert bluray disc is excellent. The picture quality is also very good. I have revised my original review to remove what I stated earlier about audio and video being out of sync. Apparently that resulted from erroneous setting of the sound system on my part. Turning off the TV's audio eliminated that issue.",1425081600,2,747,4.659090909090909

5016038,2,B006T8KT6M,"Carlos Santana is a WAY over-rated, blues-based, box-scale guitarist, who doesn't know how to incorporate other instruments into his music, at least on this release.

Sometimes, Mr. Carlos, too much is too much.

When a musician scales a great song down to its bare bones, usually, it can shine brighter than anything doctored up with too many horns and too many vocalists and too much production in general. Then when you put Carlos' boring, mundane, redundant soloing on top of that, what you get is a terrible creation altogether. Santana's soloing prowess is only a hair above Neil Young's, and that's not saying much at all. .

I will be getting rid of my Blu-ray posthaste. It simply sucks.",1397779200,,696,4.831932773109243

5016041,3,B006T8KT6M,"I got this because I loved ""Europa"" on YouTube.
Sadly, that's the best cut.
Technically, it's done pretty well, although it starts off poorly.
Cut #1 was so goofy I thought ""What has happened to Santana?""
Overpowering drums and hip hop lyrics? Unlistenable. For Montreux?
It did get better, but it's not one of those classics you listen to over and over.
I admit I skipped over some songs, I'd listen to the first 10 seconds, and if it was
weird, I'd move on.
All the musicians were good, but maybe there were too many. The music got cluttered.
I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars. If you only get one Santana, this isn't for you.
Maybe 30 yrs of pot smoking has affected his memory.
Nothing wrong with playing songs the way we remember them.",1395964800,,737,4.426470588235294

5016048,2,B006T8KT6M,"Holy cow. I loved Santana since I was 10 and first heard ""Open Invitation."" As some other critical reviews pointed out, too many cooks ruin the recipe. In this case, Carlos must have thought if one singer is good, two are better, and three is fantastic. Layer percussion upon unneeded percussion, because a 'bigger' sounding performance must be better.

As one other review I read (should have read before purchasing), the classic ""Open Invitation"" used to be a rock song, but in this concert it (along with many other songs) sounds like a Broadway show tune version of itself with way too many extra things going on. But, by far, the WORST offender is that terrible and unnecessary horn section. During my first view of the concert, during 'Maria Maria', they hit so loud at the time you should be just hearing Carlos' solo, I literally screamed out loud - ""WHAT THE F*&%!!!"" I wanted to kick them off the stage along with everybody else except Carlos, one singer, bass, drums, and keyboard.

Really bummed out because I wanted to love this concert. But the ""Broadway showtune"" arrangements, too many unnecessary musicians (and singers) on stage, and that horrendous horn section (brought WAY UP in the mix) ruined it for me. Not keeping this one.",1386460800,3,1248,4.8

At the beginning, for some God only knows reason, Carlos Santana lets one of his singers do a Rap cover of AC/DC's Back in Black. I'm seeing this and thinking to myself, s#*t !!! Have I just flushed my money down the toliet to see Rap covers of Santana songs too?? Thankfully, no. After that waste, some real, authentic music ensues for your listening pleasure.

At first I didn't care for the voices but I did warm up to them as the concert went on and for the most part I did like what I heard. Reading many reviews here and a great many struck me as odd, like comments on the horns, ya mean horns don't fit in Mexican music, better take a trip to Mexico.  The video was very well shot as well as the music was well balanced. On a 5.1 system it sounded almost as you were sitting right there among the fans.

This concert shows Carlos Santana seasoned and shaped by so many years as a creative artist and popular musician on a spiritual journey that you will feel in your heart, your gut, and in your dancing feet that will not be able to keep still. Mr. Santana's musical prowess, his grace, beauty, and humility are felt throughout the performance with his extremely talented and tightly knit band.

The set list covers Santana's entire career back to the enduring beauty of Woodstock Days, and includes tributes to other greats, such as BB King, John Coltrane (A Love Supreme) and Cream - Clapton, Jack Bruce & Ginger Baker (Sunshine of Your Love). The alchemy of Susan Tedeschi and Derek Truck's contribution in ""Make Somebody Happy"" was a nugget of emotional, spiritual, musical gold.

This is a performance delving into so many musical dimensions with dynamic, ever changing rhythms and energy that build to an oh-so-satisfying climactic conclusion. There are so many layers to be experienced in this concert for those of us that missed that evening at Montreaux, this wonderfully produced and edited HD DVD is a treasure well worth its price.

As a guitar player myself,my only gripe is Carlo's sound. His guitar sounds too distorted and lacking punch. I much prefer the clean type of overdrive on the early Santana albums when he was using Gibsons with P-90 pick-ups and Fender Twin Reverb amps. Overall,a fine performance. The interviews are inconsequential. Carlos waxing on about his usual naive""new-age hippy utopianism can't we all just get along universalistic"" philosophy.",1336089600,3,592,4.871287128712871

I love Santana taking to the crowd and they have an interview with him and a separate interview with his wife on the disc.  During the performance Santana brings up a young boy from the crowd while he is playing!  His sentiments about peace and harmony in the world voiced during the concert just add to his music.

It is an outstanding recording of some of Santana's most loved composiitions, along with a few songs found on the last studio record,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guitar-Heaven-The-Greatest-Guitar-Classics-Of-All-Time/dp/B00433QE3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics Of All Time</a>&nbsp;I was skeptical since Santana has released numerous recordings of Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen/Oye Como Va, Europa, Soul Sacrifice and Samba Pa Ti.  However, I was very pleased with the high quality of the performances, as well as the overall sound quality and video production.  The music has a freshness and immediacy that belies the classic status of these and other compositions.  Contrary to a previous reviewer's complaints about the presence of a horn section and a second vocalist, both dramatically enhanced the impact of the music.  The live recordings of Back in Black and Sunshine of Your Love are far superior to the versions on the studio album.  In this performance Carlos makes the songs his own, unlike the mere covers found on the CD.  The horn section is superb, featuring Bill Ortiz on trumpet and Jeff Cressman on trombone.  The percussion section, always an outstanding component of the ensemble sound, here reach new heights, in no small part due to the presence of Dennis Chambers on drums, now a regular member of the band.  His solid background as one of the pre-eminent jazz and fusion drummers, known for his work with John McLaughlin and Mike Stern, serves him very well in this setting.  Guest appearances from Carlos Santana's new wife Cindy Blackman, and rising stars Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi provide their own highlights and a little variety to the program.  But the sheer joy and superb perfromances by the band and Carlos himself make this a must have video for fans old and new alike.",1333929600,5,2070,5.414330218068536

The rest sounds really good and the band is strong.  Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi show up for a couple of songs and add nicely to the performance. The total concert time here is more than two hours and forty five minutes. I have a number of Santana dvds / blu rays and this one (for me) is one of the better ones.
