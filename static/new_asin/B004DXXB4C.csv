8426272,5,B004DXXB4C,"I've been a fan of Russell Tovey's since BEING HUMAN, and I finally decided to track this show down and watch a few episodes. It's so funny and I see so much of my own relationship in theirs. I just wish the DVDs were available in the US! I really hope the BBC gets around to that soon! I would love nothing more than to throw money at them to own this show and be able to watch it whenever I want.",1357171200,5,398,3.8658536585365852
