2644192,5,B000HWZ4J8,I've been waiting for these for a long time. Has anyone heard about a release of season one in the original black and white?,1160697600,6,124,4.208333333333333

do the right thing.in this crazy world what a change of pace.

thanks for not waiting any longer to put these on dvd.",1159747200,9,319,4.266666666666667
2644194,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Why write a detailed review?  Anybody reading this right now already knows about Gomer Pyle and the fact that the DVD release is long overdue, and that it is one of the funniest shows from the sixties, can I get an amen?",1159747200,15,220,4.238095238095238
2644195,4,B000HWZ4J8,"A guilty pleasure.  While not consistently as funny as its parent, the classic 'The Andy Griffith Show', 'Gomer Pyle, USMC' was warm-hearted, filled with memorable characters (Louann Poovey, Sergeant Carter, Miss Bunny, Duke, etc.) and frequent laugh-out-loud moments.  Many (most?) espisodes are superior to the majority of TAGS seasons six through eight.",1159660800,6,356,5.826923076923077

2644197,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Although I was more of a fan of Seasons 2 and 3, I am so happy to see that Gomer Pyle USMC is FINALLY being released on DVD!!  My VHS tapes are so worn from the constant playing!  The first Season is not to be missed though.  Gomer coming right out of Mayberry RFD/Andy Griffith and straight into the Marines to face the sweet tender hearted quiet Sgt. Carter (not!).  On a side note, Frank Sutton was truly an incredible powerful actor, and his early death in 1971 from a heart attack was unfortunate. He was in many movies prior to Gomer...too many to mention.  One of my all time favorite actors.  I can't wait until this December!!!  I will be rush ordering this one for sure!!  Highly recommended!",1158278400,49,702,4.387596899224806
2644198,5,B000HWZ4J8,"I definitely agree with Kyle's review. I Love this show and have been waiting forever for it to come out. I remember watching this when I was younger and still laugh while I watch some of them that I have taped on VHS. I already preordered this when it comes out in December and I also hope that they will make the other season's as well. Thank you so much for doing this!!!!!!

2644199,5,B000HWZ4J8,"This has been one of my favorite shows since childhood, and I think it's long overdue for a quality DVD release.  And if this release has the quality of the Andy Griffith releases from Paramount, it will be top-notch.

Jim Nabors distinguished himself first on Griffith's show--and later on ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.""--by creating one of the most lovable and memorable characters in television history.  Gomer Pyle is now part of American culture, thanks to Nabors' genius, and during the turbulent years of the mid- to late-1960s, ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" was a pleasant ""escape"" from the realities of that period.  Some folks have criticized the show because it wasn't a realistic depiction of life in the Marine Corps, but I'm willing to set that aside because it's just delightful comedy, played by a gifted company including Frank Sutton, Forrest Compton, Allan Melvin, Ronnie Schell, and many others.  We can debate historical and military accuracy, but I also think we can over-think such things.  The quality of the acting, the scripts, and the direction of ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" makes it a winner for all time.

I remember watching Gomer in reruns for years after his prime-time run, but alas, the show has been hard to find in recent years.  It's a great service that Paramount is doing by bringing it to us once again.  In the case of the Griffith show releases, the DVDs were attractively packaged, with superb sound and video.  I would expect that those standards will be upheld with the release of this spin-off.  I only hope they elect to release the subsequent seasons.  I'm sure I'll be buying them as well.",1157500800,12,1619,4.8901098901098905

2644328,5,B000HWZ4J8,"For light entertainment, Gomer and Sgt. Carter are outstanding to watch.  What a terrific pair, both Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton were so talented and skilled.  Interestingly, Sutton was a real life war hero, having made many pacific beach landings (and lived to tell about it) in WWII.  As for Nabors who plays Gomer, it's wonderful to occasionally hear him sing in this series.  A fantastic voice.  The lovable personality of Pyle can be both annoying and endearing and is a pleasure to watch.  The personality of Gomer can be frustrating - he doesn't know when to shut up, overly helpful - which leads to trouble, dimwitted and not terribly bright BUT also very wise in his seemingly lack of social skills.  The Sergeant also demonstrates a lack of common sense many times, as well as a hard headed bull in a China shop character.  Together, they are a terrific team as well as the many skilled actors around them.  Innocent and feel good happy TV.",1423094400,2,950,4.674698795180723

2644372,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Gomer Pyle has made the big time, folks! After a recurring role the previous season on ""The Andy Griffith Show"", Jim Nabors lands his own sitcom. Gomer Pyle finds himself in the United States Marine Corps, as well as being up against a tough-nosed, by-the-book Gunnery Sergeant named Vincent Carter (played by Frank Sutton). Gomer was first seen joining the Marines in the pilot episode that was part of ""TAGS"". Now he's in the big leagues, up against some real raw recruits. Gomer tries his best to test his mettle in the sitcom's first episode titled ""Gomer Overcomes The Obstacle Course"". Gomer wants to get Sergeant Carter his commendation, so he tends to the course like a fish takes to water. Gomer's honesty shines through in the episode ""Pay Day"", where he feels he's not deserving of the pay he supposedly earned, so he forfeits part of his paycheck. Carter tries to get Gomer to accept his earnings to no avail. A funny episode! Gomer's fondness for animals nearly lands him in hot water in ""Private Ralph Skunk"", & Carter & Gomer each take a test to enter Officers Candidate School in ""Officer Candidate Gomer Pyle"", with Pyle surprisingly beating out Carter! It's a near-disaster when Gomer gets assigned to MP duty in ""Gomer The MP"", & Duke (played by Ronnie Schell) & Gomer find themselves on an around the world flight in ""The Jet Set"", just for a box of lousy stinkin' cigars! Sgt. Carter does his best to keep Gomer off of the honor guard in the episode ""Gomer Makes The Honor Guard"". Sgt. Carter absolutely hates being loved, & tries to get Pyle to despise him in ""Nobody Loves A Sergeant"". Carter & Pyle find themselves on a survival mission in the episode ""Survival of the Fattest"", where Gomer seems to be having the time of his life & Carter is downright miserable! There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments in this first season of ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" - which first hit the airwaves on September 25, 1964. You won't want to miss out on all the fun & excitement of this action-packed, comical First Season, so make sure you add ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. - The Complete First Season"" to your essential video library ASAP!

What made the show so funny was that this country boy was trying to live in the city environment...and staying with his country mentality and upbringing. ""you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy"" kind of thing. But the 4th season..they started taking the country out of Gomer and it just wasn't that funny. Just another city boy in the city. They also have Sgt Carter's constant yelling at Gomer get more to the violent side and so constant..I was muting it most of the time. It just got out of hand. The 5th season...they kind of flipped the mentality of Gomer and Sgt. Carter and made Gomer the ""smart"" one and Sgt Carter the ""dumb"" one (for lack of better wording).

2644414,5,B000HWZ4J8,"For various reasons, I got all of the Andy Griffith seasons and even three of the other Gomer seasons before I got this.  Since I didn't look at any product reviews or descriptions first, I assumed it would be the same basic format.  What an awesome surprise!  I had no idea that I was getting hours of special features and commentary.  The episodes themselves are sweetly nostalgic to watch after years of not seeing them, and the bonus clips from Lucy, the Jim Nabors hour, and more take you right back to an earlier, more innocent era of American culture.  I'm very happy with this purchase.

This first season of Gomer is fresh and funny.  The writers had a new premise to play with and relationships between characters to establish, and the results will crack you up if your sense of humor has a wholesome side.  The basic structure of the shows is, first, Gomer's backwoods ""simple"" nature leads to some monumental crisis.  Next, Sgt. Carter uses his superior intelligence and city-slicker sophistication to either fix it or cover it up.  Finally, either Gomer's country common sense or his almost supernatural good luck leads to an even happier ending for him than anyone thought possible, while at the same time dealing Sgt. Carter a gloomy conclusion and making him look somehow dumber than Gomer.  Yet the writers offer a different take on that formula with every episode, and dig funny ideas out of the basic premise at every turn.

In addition, the Jim Nabors commentaries are charming.  The character and the man are exactly alike in honesty and innocence, so it's just good, clean fun to hear Nabors discuss details about the early days of the show, or reminisce about being on the set of The Andy Griffith Show.  I loved hearing him talk about Ron Howard's childhood and its influence on his later success.  It was also touching to hear him talk about Don Knotts, who had recently passed when the commentaries were recorded.  If you ever enjoyed this show, the Season 1 collection is affordable and will surely give you hours of enjoyable entertainment.  It's easily one of my favorite DVD sets.",1301097600,3,2110,4.752747252747253

2644459,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Gomer Pyle USMC could be considered a secondary spinoff. Its direct ancestor was The Andy Griffith Show.  Introduced in Season 3, this naive but lovable mechanic was soon a regular.  He joins many other TV characters originally written for one episode.  They include:  Nurse Carol Hathaway, Cpl. (later Sgt.) Maxwell Klinger, Steve Urkel, and even Jack Tripper's pal Larry Dallas.  The Andy Griffith Show got introduced on an episode of The Danny Thomas Show.  This DVD set includes the pilot, which ended Season 4 of TAGS.  It was actually filmed earlier in the year. The episode also introduced Sgt. Vince Carter, played by the late Frank Sutton.  He and Nabors would be the only two regulars throughout the series' run.  Ronnie Schell played Duke Slater, but did another series one year.  Larry Hovis appeared in several episodes.  The late Pete Deuel was another recruit.  There are 30 episodes in this first season.  Could you imagine a show doing that many now? The platoon starts off in boot camp.  After graduation, they get sent to Camp Henderson in California.  Ironically, they're reunited with their old DI.  He had switched bases on account of a certain recruit. Surprise, it was Gomer!  There are several wacky adventures.  Gomer may not be the brightest bulb.  But he's definitely not the dimmest.  At times Sgt. Carter doesn't seem much smarter.  Pvt. Pyle's actions may not always be strictly Marine.  But they turn out well in the end.  How could you not like him?  Some of the best episodes involve Gomer with women.  His Southern manners come in conflict with Capt. Ironpants.  He tipped his hat, instead of saluting her!  See what happens when he dates the colonel's daughter.  Later he gets another date with her.  But his favorite movie star also asked him!  Look out!  We're treated to his singing and dancing. Thankfully, he didn't record ""When The Roll Is Called Up Yonder"" in his Gomer voice.  TAGS producer Aaron Ruben oversaw this show.  Several episodes were written by TAGS writers.  Two were directed by Howard Morris, aka Ernest T. Bass.  Many TAGS guest stars also appear in these episodes.  Each played different characters.  They include Ellen Corby and Gavin Macleod.  Another, Don Rickles, later did the series CPO Sharkey with Ruben.  I also saw one of the Fun Girls, and Barney's karate instructor.  Ironically, the last episode of this season had the actor who played Malcolm Tucker in TAGS' ""Man in A Hurry"" episode. That one introduced a certain bumbling mechanic.  Other guest stars include Mr. Whipple (Dick Wilson) and Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams).  This set improves some on TAGS releases.  Besides the pilot, we also get audio introductions to every episode by Jim Nabors.  He does commentaries on the pilot and first regular episode.  Schell does commentary on the dragonlady episode.  Too bad Sutton wasn't still around to share his thoughts.  There are some interesting bonus features.  Unlike these episodes, they are in color.  We see Nabors' cameo on a Lucy Show episode. His program was shot at Desilu studios. The complete  ""Caught In The Draft"" episode can be found on some public domain collections.  He wasn't called by his character's name here.  A David Frost Show clip has more footage from that famous Marine haircut.  Nabors also included a Brothers-in-Law sketch from his variety show.  Sutton and Schell also appear.  Unfortunately, the other actors weren't identified.  My beefs with this set are few.  English subtitles would always be nice.  I wish that they were required on all English DVDs. A laugh track delete option would have been wonderful.  Before doing a spinoff, producers should ask themselves several questions.  One, what effect would this character's absence have on the first show?  That only applies for regular or recurring characters. Ditto if the first show's not being cancelled.  Like many TAGS fans, I consider the shark jump to be Don Knotts' departure.  But some fans voted for Nabors' leaving. I do think that Ruben's leaving to concentrate on this series hurt worse.  Two, can the actor and/or character carry a series on his or her own?  Thankfully, the answer here is yes.  Three,  will the character be asked back if the spinoff fails?  Once again, that doesn't apply if both shows are off the air.  Four, to what extent will we be reminded of the first show here?  Gomer occasionally mentioned the folks in Mayberry.  Strangely, his visiting grandfather was named Otis.  Some would come visit him in upcoming seasons.  Get ready to have a good time!  This is definitely a family show.

2644464,5,B000HWZ4J8,"I remember watching this growing up and even when I enjoy it at the time I didn't realise how funny it really is. The series ran on CBS from September 25, 1964 to May 2, 1969 and from it's premiere it was an instant smash hit with the viewers, ranking third overall in the Nielsen Ratings for the 1964-65 season, even beating out it's original host series ""The Andy Griffith Show"". During it's five year prime-time run the show never left the Nielsen top ten. This set accomplishes what it set's out to do and it's to be very funny with both Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton becoming an inspired comedy team and their antics in The ""Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C. - The Complete First Season"" episodes are quite entertaining to behold.

2644513,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Gomer Pyle is another show in a string of classic sitcoms from the 1960s that still provides hours of enjoyment. The first season debuted at number three in the TV ratings which is pretty good for the first season of any show. A major factor for the quick success was that the character of Gomer Pyle appeared for several years on the Andy Griffith show. Even without that exposure, Gomer Pyle would still have enjoyed great success it just would have taken a little longer. The following episodes in Season 1 are my favorites and are classics by any standard:

1. Private Ralph Skunk - Gomer adopts a pet skunk
2. Pay Day - Gomer is accused of loafing by Sgt Carter. Gomer then refuses to collect his pay even at the insistence of the Pentagon.
3. Survival of the Fattest - Gomer and Sgt Carter are paired together for a five-day survival test
4. Sergeant Carter, Marine Babysitter - Because of Gomer, Sgt Carter ends up babysitter an infant instead of going on his date.
5. Sergeant of the Week - Sgt Carter believes that Gomer is dying and goes to extreme lengths to make his last days as comfortable as possible.
6. Love Letters to the Sarge - In order to make Sgt Carter feel good, Gomer starts writing him anonymous lover letters.
7. Officer Candidate Gomer Pyle - Sgt Carter and Gomer both take the Officer Training exam and Gomer obtains a higher score.
8. Gomer Makes the Honor Guard - Sgt Carter needs to select 4 men for the honor guard and he tries everything to keep Gomer from being selected.
9. The Jet Set - Gomer is sent on an errand and ends up on an international flight. (This is my favorite episode in Season 1 and very well may be one of the funniest 30 minutes of comedy ever seen on TV. Basically, Gomer is ordered by Sgt Carter to purchase a specific brand of cigars for a visiting general. Because of his friend Duke, Gomer unwittingly ends up on an international flight to Italy, France, and England. Along the way Gomer calls Sgt Carter to let him know that he is still on his errand to get the cigars. Carter becomes suspicious when he hears foreign voices in the background.)

The 30 episodes in Season 1 will provide endless hours of enjoyment for the entire family. I highly recommend it.",1187654400,,2220,4.452088452088452

2644517,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Ok, if you're reading this you probably are already an Andy Griffith Show and Gomer Pyle fan, and so need no further convincing that this set is well worth buying.  Just some notes of special things to watch out for:

1. ""Gomer the M.P.""-features Robert Emhardt, the ""Man In A Hurry"" from the TAGS episode of the same name.

2. One of the early shows of this season, ""A Date With The Colonel's Daughter"" features Karl Swenson, who played ""Mr. McBeevee"" in the TAGS episode of the same name.  In this episode he plays COL Harper, and his daughter's name is Jane, played by Suzanne Benoit.

3. Later in this season, the episode ""Gomer Dates A Movie Star"" is something of a continuation of ""A Date With The Colonel's Daughter"", except in this episode the COL is played by Forrest Compton (who later became a semi-regular playing the COL) and his name has been changed from COL Harper to COL Gray.  Suzanne Benoit is still on hand as the COL's daughter, and also featured in this episode is Ruta Lee, who TAGS fans will recognize as the ""college kid"" reporter from the TAGS episode ""Andy On Trial"".

4. ""Old Man Carter""-features Alvy Moore (Hank Kimball from Green Acres).

5. The award for the most TAGS alumni in a single episode of Gomer Pyle goes to ""Love Letters To The Sarge"".  Keep your eyes open for no less than four Andy Griffith characters: Jean Carson (""Daphne"", the sultrier half of ""the fun girls"" who likes to sidle up to Andy and purr ""Hello doll"" in his ear), Jackie Joseph (the object of Ernest T. Bass's affection, his darling ""Romeena"" in the TAGS episode ""My Fair Ernest T. Bass""), Mary Lansing (who appeared in numerous TAGS episodes over the years including the saleslady who sells Opie the stockings for Helen in ""Opie Loves Helen"" and also played Emmet's wife in the last season), and Charles Thompson (who played Asa, the hotel clerk, bank guard, night watchman in Weaver's dept store, etc. in numerous TAGS episodes).

6. But the most bizarre connection between this first season of Gomer Pyle and TAGS is the episode ""The Case Of The Marine Bandit"".  This episode is something of a mirror image of the TAGS episode ""Barney's First Car"" in that in both episodes the old lady ""bad guy"" is played by Ellen Corby (as running a car chop shop on TAGS and using Marines to rob liquor stores on GP), and the nice little old lady who shows up in the epilogs of both episodes is also played by the same actress, Hallene Hill.  Watch ""Barney's First Car"" and then watch ""The Case Of The Marine Bandit"" and you'll see what I mean, it's interesting and makes you wonder how it could have happened by accident, or if the casting directors engineered it this way intentionally.

From the first notes of that unforgetable theme music to the closing credits, I enjoy every minute of a walk down memory lane. It's also amusing to see how many guest stars went on to bigger and better things. For example Wayne Rogers played a Marine Captain in the episode ""A Date for the General's Daughter."" Of course Rogers went on to play an ARMY Captain, Trapper John McIntyre on M*A*S*H.

And Jim Nabors recorded plenty of commentary for the episodes and also included clips from other shows, like Gomer's cameo appearance on an episode of The Lucy Show, when Lucy accidentally gets drafted, or when Nabors appeared on the David Frost show.

2644682,5,B000HWZ4J8,"I had some very fond memories of The Gomer Pyle Show during its' run and I'm happy to say this first season set didn't disappoint in the least.

The years of its' initial run was a time when a plethora of military related shows graced the TV screens of homes throughout North America. Shows like Rat Patrol and Combat gave us the serious side of things while shows like McHales Navy(I'm anxiously awaiting THIS show to come out!) and of course this one the Gomer Pyle Show.

This show gave us an already familiar and likable character from the then popular Andy Griffith Show and put him into his own show. To make the transition more smooth for the TV audience they created an entire Griffith episode for just that purpose(included in this set..a VERY nice touch).From then on the producers and writers of the new show started to flesh out and create a totally lovable character in the form of new USMC recruit Pvt. Gomer Pyle. The able and very talented Jim Nabors rose to the occasion brilliantly and helped create one of the most memorable TV characters ever. Gomer could be a bumbler and pull some boners but his down home charm and sensibilities underscored the fact that he was far from stupid. He didn't have a mean bone in his body,always looked to the best inside everyone and did everything with the best of intentions. In other words a totally likable/lovable person.

Now of course to counter so much goodness there has to be a foil. And that took the form of one Sgt. Carter portrayed with great gusto and pinnache by Frank Sutton. His character was a 15 year decorated Korean career Marine vet and he played the tough as nails DI to a tee. But as tough and Marine as he was he did have a soft side and was always perplexed at why Gomer liked him. Even in the Sergeants' worst moments of Gomer-induced apoplexy(Frank Suttons' facial expressions have to be seen to appreciated!) we always knew that the sarge himself wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed sometimes either.

And throughout it all shone Gomers' innocence,his never say die spirit and his continual longing to always please the sergeant.

The two characters AND the two actors that help shape them were matches made in TV heaven. Wonderfully acted and beautifully executed these two men  made the show the success it ultimately became and the reason it is remembered so fondly by so many. And of course these two were surrounded by a great stable of TV character actors and directors watched over by the benevolent Sheldon Leonard who is one of if not THE most prolific TV producer ever.

In conclusion a wonderful and memorable TV show is awaiting all who buy this great DVD set. The on screen chemistry and portrayals of principals Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton are a marvel to behold. The show promises much and delivers. The laughs are in abundance and again(as I point out in all my reviews re family oriented entertainment) if you are looking for a series the ENTIRE family can watch,enjoy and laugh with I can highly recommend this one. When was the last time you saw a program in recent years you could do THAT with??.......I can't hear you!!!??",1166400000,10,3127,4.613309352517986
2644683,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Frank Sutton's ""Sergeant Carter"" is by far one of the all-time GREAT, ORIGINAL sitcom characters! His facial expressions had me laughing more than anything else on this box set! Why haven't the rubes over at TV Guide ever featured him in one of their ""Greatest TV Characters"" articles??? HAH??????

The GOMER PYLE, USMC stories are typical sitcom fare, but done in original, top-notch form! Jim Nabors, of course, is the legendary Gomer Pyle, and he introduces EACH episode.

There are some cool bonus features, like a Jim Nabors interview conducted by David Frost, a Gomer appearance on an old ""Lucy Show"" episode, the pilot which was an ""Andy Griffith Show"" episode (complete with commentary by Nabors), an eight-minute skit from ""The Jim Nabors Hour"" with Jim and Frank Sutton, an episode commentary by Ronnie Schell and more.

Speaking of Schell, I feel he's very underrated as part of this show. His portrayal of ""Duke Slater"" may go unnoticed by some but he's a vital part of this show, as he tends to lead ol' Gome astray from time to time. He hams it up in a couple of shows...pay attention to him and see how terrific a job he does!

Barbara Stuart makes only one appearance as the ""Dragon Lady,"" as she hasn't yet been cast as Sergeant Carter's girlfriend, Bunny; but seeing this sexy woman will urge you to buy the rest of the series when she finally joins the cast.

So, if you remember watching this show the first time around or in late-night reruns, get this set.....and I bet you can't keep a straight face when Sergeant Carter either yells at Pyle or makes his funny, exasperated, puzzling faces! They're a scream!",1166313600,5,1631,4.708771929824562

2644716,5,B000HWZ4J8,"This DVD set of Gomer Pyle USMC is amazing. The Complete First season in all its Black/White Glory..(Even though Amazon listed it as color, its B/W!!). This is absolutly one of the funniest shows in history! I have a 10 year old daughter to whom I am now getting hooked on Gomer! I grew up with it and now I can pass this bit of TV to my kids. Nothing much on tv today. I prefer the old shows! Gomer is a Classic and its way cool to be able to buy this piece of history! I noticed that Wal-Mart didn't get this set in. Best Buy had it for $31.99. I just bought it here at Amazon, since they where the cheapiest. Gomer fans need to buy this so wwe can get more seasons released. Here is hoping Season 2 will be just around the corner!

2644717,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Though I must agree with a previous review about the later seasons being a bit better, Season 1 certainly has it's merits, and is worth the price of admission.  How much better does it get to see Pyle and Sgt. Carter come back from a survival course and actually gain weight?  Or getting stuck on a transcontinental flight, being declared AWOL, and then becoming a hero?  Character development is a consistent trait in the first season of most shows.  Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. is no exception, but it's still fun to watch.",1165968000,,518,4.65934065934066
2644718,5,B000HWZ4J8,"This season has never looked better.  Beautifully mastered.  Nice sound and a C-ration of extras to complete it.

I really enjoyed the Jim Nabors commentaries (on the pilot and TAGS spinoff).  Any GOMER PYLE fan will love the set, which comes in new slimline cases with episode synopses written on the back of each case.",1165881600,8,320,4.763636363636364
2644719,5,B000HWZ4J8,"A LONG overdue release -- I've already put in my preorder. One of the best, and strangest, sitcoms of all time indeed, and it's been woefully absent from syndication for several years now. I can't wait until the whole series is available! Kudos to Paramount for FINALLY making this available in Season sets. Awesome!",1164326400,7,316,4.87037037037037
2644720,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Always loved this show, one of my all time favorites & now I'm going to love watching it on DVD. I have been checking over the years to see if it's out on the market, so glad 1st season is out-please, please get all 5 seasons on DVD ASAP, I'm ready to buy!!!!",1163548800,5,259,3.9056603773584904
2644721,5,B000HWZ4J8,"What is reviewer MrQ talking about, what is he smoking? Don't get me wrong I too am not a big fan of Paramount after the way they have handled the release of Season 1 of Happy Days. In other words no follow up. ButMrQ obviously does not understand the Television industry, as it take tens of thousands of dollars to colourize the Black and white versions of any show/movie. The feed back verbally and sales wise is proof of the fact purchasers do not want colorized versions of their favorites. King Kong, the 1933 classic, is living proof of this, as the original black and white version well out sells the colourized version big time. More and more studios are moving away from this. So MrQ should research this before opening his big mouth in the future. Just be glad to have these classics, that all too often do not appear on tv any more. If the studios were to colourize the original prints, you would end up paying huge amounts to purchase these films.",1162598400,5,959,4.485714285714286
2644722,5,B000HWZ4J8,Don't be fooled by the cover or what it says about the release.  It is the black and white version.  And please get people to buy this or this will be the only season you will see.  It will be piled on the heap of rejects like Happy Days and Mork and Mindy.  So please let people know about this and buy it.  This is too good a show to only have one season release.,1162166400,7,365,3.8133333333333335
2644723,5,B000HWZ4J8,"FRANK SUTTON's the STAR...  Without him the show is only mediocre.

Sgt Carter's Mannerism's, his facial expressions, his face turning

Red when he's mad.  Come on, that guys a Comic Genius !!!!

Just remember the episode that he bet Sgt Hacker he could go 24 hours

without getting mad and he finally couldn't take it anymore, so he

drives his Jeep out in the middle of nowhere and parks, climbs up

to the top of the mountain and starts Screaming at the top of

his Lungs for 5 minutes, then goes back to the Barracks and he's

drinking milk holding his stomach from an Ulcer.. I'm still laughing",1162080000,11,599,4.462962962962963
2644724,5,B000HWZ4J8,"Now that they finally got this dvd on the market I wonder how long it will take those pokey producers to get the second season out. I hope it won't take them as long as it's taking them to produce the complete ""All In The Family"" series. They really need to ""Move Move Move On The Double!""",1161561600,5,289,4.087719298245614
