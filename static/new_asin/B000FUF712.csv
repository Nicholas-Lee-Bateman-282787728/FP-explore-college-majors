2588666,3,B000FUF712,This is an okay movie. Why okay? I watched it and I can't remember what it was all about. It looked good but it wasn't a classic movie to watch over and over again.,1323648000,,164,3.8529411764705883

2588669,2,B000FUF712,"Talented actors wasted in this movie.  This story is so predictable that you can have the plot figured out in the first 10 minutes. I bought this DVD for my daughter because she is a big Star Wars/Mark Hamill fan and wanted this movie for that reason.  Mark Hamill is made to be the sterotypical nerd in this movie.  The many mini plot lines that make up this movie have been told often. Nerd falls for popular girl, bully beats up nerd, angel comes to earth with a mission to get someone's life back on track, nerdy girl falls for ""wrong guy"" jock, nerdy girl puts on some makeup and becomes pretty and popular, ect..  Every one of these overused plots is woven into this movie.  There is nothing offensive in this movie, it is just not very interesting.",1211587200,,755,4.402877697841727

8126646,3,B000FUF712,Okay for diehard Mark Hamill (he plays the geek) and Cindy Williams fans who like Lifetime Channel movies.  Essentially the poor man's/TV version of Peggy Sue Got Married.  Roddy McDowall is a hoot.,1452038400,,198,4.96969696969697
