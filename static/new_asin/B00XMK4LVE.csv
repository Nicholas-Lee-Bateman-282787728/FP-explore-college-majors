8716324,1,B00XMK4LVE,this set got one star because there was nothing lower.  i have seen high school productions with better acting .  i found no redeeming value in any of the films.,1534636800,,161,4.333333333333333

8716326,1,B00XMK4LVE,I bought this SOLELY for Project Shadowchaser.  The audio was GARBAGE and the picture was RUBBISH.  It appears to be a VHS rip of very low quality.  Certainly NOT a DVD release!!,1477785600,,178,4.5
8716327,4,B00XMK4LVE,"This is a collection of five B movies, but they were surprisingly fun to watch and the price was right.  The cover art is misleading, though.",1443052800,4,141,4.423076923076923
