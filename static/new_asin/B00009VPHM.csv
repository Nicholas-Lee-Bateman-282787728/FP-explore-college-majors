1891154,1,B00009VPHM,"I own this movie on VHS. I have enjoyed it many times and used it to initiated many hesitant people into the world of older B+W movies.
However, the company who released this DVD version, Reel Enterprises, is incredible. By far, this is the single worst ""professional"" DVD copy I have ever seen. Absolutely horrible!! First is the media which is burnable DVD-R, a media reserved for only the lowest of professional outfits. It does not last nearly as long as real DVD media. Second is the quality. It looks as though this was a badly compressed rip of an actual DVD. That means there are digital ""artifacts"" all over the image, which also has horrible contrast making the image almost unviewable. Then the there is the sound which is muffled and difficult to hear, unlike the movie itself which has high quality sound due to the fact that Gracie Fields was a singer and the dialogue is snappy.  This is almost unlistenable.  Lastly is the company's watermark which is embedded in the lower right hand corner and is quite distracting. I have never bought a real DVD and ever had such a watermark.  All I can say is that I love this movie but will never ever buy another DVD from this company, Reel Enterprises. Apparently, their only concern is taking your money, not distributing a quality product.",1322006400,22,1298,4.6593886462882095
1891155,5,B00009VPHM,"An engaging story of a woman, you would like to be friends with, who finagles a job when there are none. In order to keep it she must outwit her boss and her employer, and help her friends while maintaining dignity, poise, elegance and find a way for the classes to share a changing culture.",1304121600,,291,4.3090909090909095
1891156,4,B00009VPHM,"Not just a delightful comedy, but a movie with real heart, ""Molly and Me"" gives us the chance to see both Gracie Fields and Monty Wooley at something like the top of their form. Fields is really a welcome treat, since she made all-too few movies in Hollywood. We can see why this ordinary-looking woman, who looked less like one's common notion of a ""film star"" than anyone I can think of, holds such a special place in the affection of Britons that they always referred to her as ""Our Gracie."" She could really bring a picture to life! Her rapport with co-star Monty Wooley is quite noticeable. The little song they break into at the end of the picture, ending with the line ""Don't stop breathing 'til you're dead,"" is so catchy I found myself singing it at odd moments for days afterwards. The supporting cast - especially Reginald Gardiner, Edith Barrett, and Natalie Schafer - are first-rate. Picture and sound quality are both good enough that we don't lament the absence of subtitles. (By the way, we are overdue for a home video release of the other comedy in which Fields and Wooley co-starred, ""Holy Matrimony."" Hey TCF, don't be sluggards!)",1222041600,26,1150,4.669950738916256
1891157,5,B00009VPHM,"This is one of my favorite movies! I just happened to copy it on video from  public TV years ago and have been looking for it ever since as my tape is wearing out. Charming, entertaining, feel-good, and well acted, it's the story of Molly (Gracie Fields), an out-of-work vaudeville actress who applies for a housekeeping job with a Mr. John Graham (Monty Woolley), who is running for parliament. After altercations with the other dishonest servants,whom she fires, her former vaudevillian colleagues come to the rescue as cooks, butler, and housemaids to stage a successful dinner party.  Mr. Graham's  budding political career is almost ruined by the return, after many years absence, of his philandering wife. She is presumed to have died in a saintly glow by Graham's son who is played by a young Roddy McDowall. Her attempt at blackmail is thwarted by the actors/servants all coming together and staging a clever denoument. Pacing is excellent-the story really moves along. Look for the actress who plays Mrs. Howell in  TV's Gilligan's Island. If you like old B+W British movies, this is a good blend of comedy and drama - it is truly a pleasure. Enjoy!",1206662400,14,1158,4.892857142857143
1891158,4,B00009VPHM,This is a great sentimental old movie that features a very young Roddy McDowell.  It is classic Monty Woolley as the grumpy rich man who is dissatisfied with everyone around him.,1134864000,,178,4.741935483870968
1891159,5,B00009VPHM,This movie is an old British production. It was a delightful surprise. You'll recognize some actors in their younger days. The story line is fun and endearing. This is a great movie for relaxing after a hectic day.,1482969600,,214,4.657894736842105

1891162,5,B00009VPHM,"Made in 1945 it's another ""let's rally 'round, this is what we're fighting for, no place like home"" movie. For the escapist, with absolutely no mention of the war! It is a comedy full of the usual spunk and character but really is a touching movie about vaudevillains with hearts of gold,  Besides British actress Gracie Fields it features Monty Woolley and a young Rodney McDowall. You might recognize Natalie Schafer, in the 1960's she would go on to play Lovey Howell on Gilligan's Island. I love classic movies and Amazon Prime has an outstanding collection.",1474416000,,562,4.854166666666667
1891163,5,B00009VPHM,"I love this movie.  I saw it first on TCM (Turner Classic Movies).  It was enchanting.  I have since watched it twice on Amazon Prime.  TCM has the better, cleaner film cut.

1891170,5,B00009VPHM,"I love Gracie Fields, an old-time English music hall performer. I only wish she had done more singing.
In the '50s, my US Navy ship visited Naples, Italy and I took a tour to nearby Capri. Gracie had a resort there and she graciously invited all servicemen there for a meal and drinks on the house.

1891176,2,B00009VPHM,"Story is cute but sound quality is very poor, so you're stuck reading subtitles. And the subtitles have an unfortunate delay so that what you're reading is several sentences behind what's being said at the moment.  Very hard to follow the film this way.",1456876800,,253,4.75

1891180,3,B00009VPHM,It shipped here quickly but the movie was of poor quality.  Disappointed as I can only watch the movie in pitch darkness.  Didn't seem to have any problems watching the movie on cable.  Oh well I still give it 3 stars for delivery.,1446768000,,231,4.325581395348837

1891193,4,B00009VPHM,"I had never seen Gracie Fields perform, but had read about her in the David Niven books and other English history. I really enjoyed her prrformance and could see why she was a huge star in the English music halls. I enjoyed this so much, I wish there were more films available on Amazon with her in them. A light, airy story, with no surprises but a happy ending, which I like! I am also a big fan of Monty Woolley and Roddy McDowall, so double treat!

1891197,3,B00009VPHM,"This is too charming, clever and feel-good a film not to be honored with the best technical version that Amazon can buy.  If it's true that there are far better versions, please switch to one and let the film shine as it deserves.  Doing so would also be a boon to those of us who must watch such old films with old eyes, i.e. the less fuzzy the picture the better!  And is it our failing hearing or are there skips in the sound on this copy?",1433635200,2,442,4.057471264367816
1891198,5,B00009VPHM,My wife and I loved this movie.  It was hilarious and the plot was wonderful too.  It was definitely the best movie that we've seen in awhile.,1431907200,,142,4.222222222222222
1891199,5,B00009VPHM,"We're big fans of classic cinema (old movies) here, but somehow we had missed this one until recently. This story of a long out-of-work acting troupe which finds employment as domestics for a wealthy man is full of charm and good feeling. Gracie Fields is on top of her game as Molly, the first of the troupe to make the move, getting her job in a sneaky but humorous manner. She then proceeds to set the household and the family straight.

For a comedy, the story also provides some real drama, and Molly proceeds to handle those situations too. This instantly became one of my favorite ""old movies"" ... right up there with films like the Thin Man series and holiday classics like ""It's a Wonderful Life. In fact, this movie reminds me a lot of Capra films, although it isn't one.

Highly recommended.",1431043200,,802,4.5625
1891200,3,B00009VPHM,"I had watched this movie on TCM and decidied to get my own copy.  Unfortunately, TCM does not have this movie for purchase.  The version sold here was the only one I could find.  This is a terrible re-issue.  The broadcast version I had watched was great.  This one is grainy, dark in many places, scratchy, sound quality poor (bad for a movie with music) etc.  The technology exists to fix these problems.  I can on speculate as to why the DVD transcriber didn't use them.  Had I done my homework and read the reviews already posted I wouldn't have wasted my money.",1430265600,,566,4.427184466019417
1891201,4,B00009VPHM,"""Lite"" entertainment of the first rate.  Grace Fields and Monty Woolley are irresistible.  This is also the first time I saw Roddy McDowell as a child star, having grown up with him as an adult in American movies and TV.  He is also delightful.",1428537600,,244,4.5
1891202,4,B00009VPHM,"A lot of fun watching this ""hidden classic"" that, for whatever reason, was not shown over and over again on TV. A U.S. production, it nevertheless is a nice look into the world and performers of British musical comedy in the 1940s. The story is a sentimental comedy that catches you up because the lead performances are so matter-of-fact good. Certainly brightened up my night as an unexpected small jewel. Only one bad mark: Amazon did not do a good transfer of this movie, and it is too light and dark because they did a sloppy job from some copy-of-a-copy video. But stick with it and you have the added bonus of  seeing a young Natalie Shaeffer (sp?), Mrs. Thurston Howell III from Gilligan's Island, in a pivotal small role at the beginning and end.",1427414400,,754,4.5851851851851855

1891204,3,B00009VPHM,This is a black and white movie. It was old but different plot. A bunch of out of work actors use their acting skills to portray servants in a rich man's home. It had comedy and heart warming scenes.,1425081600,,199,4.128205128205129

1891210,5,B00009VPHM,In their second film together (HOLY MATRIMOMY being the first) Fields and Woolley are a delight.

To add fuel to the fire, they periodically impose an emblem of RE (Reel Enterprises) on the bottom right corner of the picture. No features, just the film.

Spoiler Alert: A theatrical company poses as household staff to a prominent Englishman (Monty Woolley) whose wife left him with a teenage son. Molly (Gracie Fields) proves to be invaluable, and helps the gentleman reconnect with his son.

1891238,4,B00009VPHM,"I loved Holy Matrimony, and I'm trying to find it on DVD. After searching for other films with Monty Woolly and Gracie Fields, I found this one. I was prepared for the poor video quality due to another reviewer, and that's what I got. Still, it's better than nothing for now. I hope someone puts some time into putting out better versions of both of these films on DVD. Until then, oh well, at least I have one of them.",1329004800,2,419,4.25

The subtitles were out of synch, however. Nothing like text that appears seconds after the dialog has ended. Ugh! Fortunately, I found the audio adequate and didn't need them. Otherwise, I would have awarded one, not five stars.",1505520000,,371,5.288135593220339
