MosaicDVD</a>&nbsp;,this DVD is a treasure. Not only is the music beautifully performed but the art selection exhibits the immaculate taste. The art is nicely arranged with great attention to emotional element of music and historical context. It never before classical art and music captured my imagination so much. The art is familiar and surprising. The art stories are interwoven with frivolous nude paintings of the time and the whole impression is so humane and touching. I can't say what it is more: the greatest art works of the classical age complimented by music or music is emphasized by timeless images.
If you never had a chance to express your interest in classical art and music this program will make you incredibly knowledgeable.
The production quality is first class; the performance is so true, so crisp. The menus are so beautiful it takes an effort to push the button... I have decent system and 32"" LCD tv and the whole experience is unbelievable. It consumes you entirely. I could smell this 18th century Europe.
Absolutely amazing and beautiful work!",1182816000,,1323,5.824742268041237
