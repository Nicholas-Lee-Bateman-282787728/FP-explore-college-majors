Danny Doring/Roadkill (w/Lita) vs. Nova/Jazz - Tag Team Match - It's crazy to see Jazz in ECW, if you thought Chyna could stand toe to toe with the men, Jazz was doing it even before her. 2/5

Spike Dudley vs. Little Guido - Originally this was Spike vs. Big Sal but quickly changed. If you want to show anybody that doesn't know who Spike Dudley is then show them this match. We're talking about a 150 pound little guy, smiling and waving at the people, nerdy glasses, tye-dye t-shirt (tye dye is hardcore!) just take down Little guido and the 400-500 pound Big Sal all by himself, no help whatsoever! Entertaining as hell! 5/5

Mike Awesome vs. Rhino - ECW Championship - Short but Mike does what he's famous for, leaping over the top rope and powerbombing people through tables. 3/5

Jerry Lynn vs. Super Crazy - Awesome high-flying match 4/5

Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido (Special Referee: Axl Rotten) - Not a bad match, but not the best either 2/5

Tajiri vs. Tommy Dreamer - Great hardcore match, fighting out with weapons and then fight it out all through the crowd, now that's ECW awesomeness! 4/5

Bill Wiles/CW Anderson vs. Vito/Spanish Angel - Tag Team Match - This was about 2 minutes in before New Jack came in and started beating the hell out of everybody with weapons, then he fought with spanish angel in a weapons match for 6 minutes, I didn't even know this was a match until New Jack made a cover and the referee count 1, 2, 3. Random!

Rob Van Dam vs. Rod Price - ECW TV Title Match - Same legendary TV title defenses you've seen RVD do. Great match 3/5

Sabu vs. Tazz - My personal favorite of this dvd. Tables, tables, and more tables.

All in all this was a great show. It's 2 hours and 15 minutes, so it's kinda short, but it's got a lot of great wrestling in it. I highly recommend.",1328918400,,1830,4.387573964497041
