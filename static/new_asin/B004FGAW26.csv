They should all have been one 1 DVD for a reasonable price. There is a tiny bit of information and then 5 yoga poses, w/o ever calling it yoga but making it seem like she invented them.",1477785600,2,342,4.196969696969697
8427830,1,B004FGAW26,"I have now gone through 6 of the Katy Bowman DVDs and this is the least relevant so far. The exercises have very little to do with improving balance. While these might provide a mild beneficial stretch, that's all they are. Also find her ""series"" a disappointing waste of money. She has 14 DVDs in total, with 5 exercises on each. The exercises are repeated in varying combinations throughout the series. A friend who bought the entire series tells me there are 20 (or less) exercises in total used/repeated throughout the 14(!!!) DVDs. Do the math - it's clearly a lame marketing tactic, especially considering half the DVD is essentially an infomercial for her program (and it's on every DVD). I have yet to find any strengthening component to her exercises-well, maybe one, but that's it  These are all static stretches that anyone who has taken any basic fitness or yoga class will have done before. Nothing new or groundbreaking. Save your money. Personally, I find the (unrelated) Classical Stretch series by Miranda Esmonde-White much more beneficial for improving flexibility, alignment, balance and strength.",1456963200,3,1117,5.070652173913044
