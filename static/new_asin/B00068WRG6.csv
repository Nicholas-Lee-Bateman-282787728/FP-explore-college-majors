8040511,5,B00068WRG6,"The duo Ban and Ginji enter the Limitless Fortress with the rest of their crew, only to get split up! Poor Ginji is stuck with the worst of them, Dr. Jakal, who terrifies Ginji-san (although seeing Ginji make all those chibi faces is pretty cute!).

Ban-chan is with Beast Master Shido, and believe it or not, they make a pretty good team!

Poor Ms. HEVN! Getting attacked by 'thugs' really sucks.

Himiko and (the cutest guy ever) Thread Master Kazuki are paired up! Woot!

Back at the Honky Tonk, a mystery is unfloding. A mysterious stranger who seems to know our sarcastic shop keeper and our GBs. Hmm....

Perfect set-up for a great plot!",1123113600,,643,4.605263157894737
8040512,5,B00068WRG6,"I must say with the first DVD I was impressed with the animation and the character design, but I felt the characters were shallow and there was little in the way of an interesting story.  It felt like there was going to be allot of repetitive capers. The main reason I even purchased the second was because I had bought the boxed set edition.

  With the second DVD it seemed like there was some potential for some interesting developments from the past.

  I am really glad I decided not to give up on this series, in this disk is where the series really begins the major story arc.  Every thing up till now was just setting the stage.  I will stop and let you enjoy the story without revealing anything if you decide to take my advice and buy this DVD.",1104451200,2,754,4.290780141843972
