8203112,3,B000RYDNBW,"So, first of all, I didn't not buy this from Amazon, however I stumbled upon it at a swap meet for $10. It's not the best sound and video quality, but it's not horrible. The thing I like most about it is the fact that, besides Knebworth from the DVD, this is one of the few video recordings from later on in their career and includes songs like Kashmir and Achilles. But, would I pay $31 for this? Definitely not.",1430611200,,413,4.175

8203115,1,B000RYDNBW,"I live in the Seattle area so I thought I would buy this DVD thinking it couldn't be that bad through Amazon. I have video bootlegs in my collection that put this one to shame. Horrible picture quality the sound isn't much better. Save your money, don't buy this DVD you will be mad at yourself if you do.",1321747200,2,305,4.186440677966102
8203116,1,B000RYDNBW,"I don't believe that this is an official release. There are audio/videos of performances like this available for free all over the internet. This seller most likely downloaded this ""rare"" performance from a peer sharing website, burned it to CD/DVD, and wants to sell it to you for big money. Ch-ching!!!

Before you buy this ask yourself, ""Have I ever heard of this release before? Are the artists getting paid a dime for this?
Is this a BOOTLEG RECORDING?",1197504000,6,457,4.784810126582278
8203117,1,B000RYDNBW,"This DVD is a bootleg. Jimmy Page had this show recorded, was unhappy with the quality of the performance that night, and chose not to release the video. I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about (""The best DVD... highly recommend""). If you want a quality recording with the band in their prime, go for the Led Zeppelin DVD, or the DVD that is released as a part of the 2 CD/1 DVD Mothership pack (same stuff as the LZ DVD, really). During this concert, Plant was ill (and he says it himself during the concert: ""I've gone deaf in one ear""), and the performance, in general, wasn't anywhere near 100%.
Then again, if you are a die-hard fan who wants to have every single recording/video of Led Zeppelin regardless of quality, you may do a little search online and find a LZ fan who will burn a DVD for you for free or as a part of an exchange. A bootleg is a bootleg, whether you dish out the money for it or get it for free. Last but not least, since this is a bootleg, not only does it infringe on the copyrighted material, but your favorite musicians will not see any of the money you pay for this recording.",1195689600,9,1123,4.252336448598131
