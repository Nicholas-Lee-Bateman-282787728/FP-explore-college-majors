The DVD was a gift to someone for Christmas so I myself have not watched the DVD and I don't think the receipent has had a chance to watch it to see if it had any problems. So, so far so good!",1168819200,,378,3.909090909090909

1341230,4,B00004R617,"...The order of the produced bond films does not follow theorder of the publication of Mr. Fleming's novels. Ian Flemingconsidered doing away with the character after the first few novelsfailed to catch on in the U.S. (in fact the first Bond novel, CASINO ROYALE was retitled YOU ASKED FOR IT during early U.S.  release) but it wasn't until YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE - the second to the last complete Fleming novel did 007 appear to die with chief antagonist Ernst Blofeld in a Holmes/Moriarity - Victoria Falls-type encounter.  He re-emerged, mentally scared,in the last Fleming novel THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.  Departing from the standard British ""Clubland Heroes"" of the 40s and 50s - pulp saviors like Bulldog Drummond, and even farther back to Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes - men who'd never even conceive of a woman as a sexual object let alone a formidable antagonist - Bond drew from the darker American archtypes Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade with a healthy dose of classical references thrown in for good measure. And as such the film THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH emerges as one of the best written Bond sagas of recent years (Book or Film).  Refer to Giraudoux's early 1900'sstageplay version of Electra and her father the King and one will have insight into T.W.I.N.E.'s niftiest plot-twist concerning the appropriately named chief female character Elektra King.  Anyway, while THE JAMES BOND STORY (which aired earlier this year on AMC) offers no staggering new insight to anyone familiar with the world's greatest secret agent. SECRET?  It does feature a much broader interview base than any other 007 documentary so far; and is a very entertaining, fast moving and informative primer for anyone seeking to enter the nearly half-century long club of international ""Bondage"". Good show 007, as well as to the producers of the documentary and the newest film.  And hey,Desmond Llewelyn ... we miss you.",957225600,19,1905,4.990536277602524

What Roger  Moore thought when that girl he had sex with in For your Eyes only turned  out to be a male.
Sean Connery only makes about 3 or 4 Appearences. HE  NEEDED MORE! He is BOND!

This action-packed documentary is a behind-the-scenes look at everything that makes people like the James Bond or 007 movies.  (For those into trivia, there was a 1954 James Bond TV episode and a 1956 Bond radio program.)  It includes brief film clips (and a few longer clips that highlight dialogue) from all the 007 movies (meaning from 1962's ""Dr. No,"" the first Bond movie to 1999's ""The World is Not Enough,"" the last Bond movie that was still in production as this documentary was being made).

There are ten scenes in this brief documentary covering everything from the origins of the series, sex and girls, violence, gadgets to the five actors who up to 1999 portrayed James Bond, locations, Ian Fleming (the author who created 007 in 1952), and the predicted future of the movie series.

The initial interviews with the five Bond actors (Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan) as well as their comments throughout are, I found, very interesting.  Be aware that at the beginning Connery mentions that there were a total of 20 Bond movies made.  But as the documentary proceeds it shows printed on screen how many Bond movies each of these actors made.  Respectively, these are {6,1,7,2,and 3 (as of 1999)}.  The total is 19.  Why the difference in totals?

The difference is due to the fact that Connery is including the movie titled ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983) in which he starred as Bond.  However, the documentary is counting only those Bond movies made by `EON Productions' and ""Never Say Never Again"" was a non-EON production.  Unfortunately, this fact is not mentioned by the narrator (actress Miranda Richardson) and this may cause confusion for some.  (Another piece of trivia--there was a 1967 comic Bond movie made that was a non-EON production.)

Besides comments made by the Bond actors, there are also comments made by others involved with some of the Bond movies such as directors and producers.  Comments are also made by ""Bond girls"" such as Maud Adams and Jane Seymour.  (You will also see other Bond girls in brief film clips that are shown.)  There is excellent archival footage of Ian Fleming and his James Bond writings.  I also enjoyed the interviews with the Bond ""gadget man"" named ""Q"" (the late Desmond Llewelyn--who was in, count them, 17 Bond movies).  These are some highlights.  Much more interesting stuff is included.

The last scene of this documentary is called ""The Furture"" where the future of the James Bond movie series is discussed.  It was predicted that Brosnan would make one more Bond movie and, as is known now, he did in 2002 (bringing the total EON Bond productions to 20).  After that, they felt sure the series would continue.  This documentary was right again!  We now have a sixth James Bond portrayed by actor Daniel Craig who made his first Bond movie in 2006 (bringing the total EON Bond productions to 21 as of the date of this review).

I did have some minor problems with this documentary:

(1)  I feel that, as discussed above, it should have been mentioned that the official Bond movies for this documentary were those made by EON productions.  By not doing so, confusion in movie count was created.

(2) This documentary implies that all Bond movies were based on the writings of Ian Fleming.  This is untrue.  After Fleming died in 1964, there were other writers that took up the Bond saga and on whose writing some movies are based.

(3) On the DVD front case for this documentary (displayed above by Amazon), it says as of 1999, that there are ""5 bonds; 19 films; over 30 years.""  The first two facts are correct.  However, this documentary goes to 1999 so it would be more accurate if it read ""over 35 years.""

There is one major problem with this documentary.  It does not discuss anything about the unique Bond theme music.  This music is an essential ingredient of all the EON Bond movies.  I thought this was a major oversight.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2000) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  I found that some of the scene selections did not match the sections in the documentary.  There is also one major extra--a multiple-choice twenty-question interactive trivia game.  I found this interesting and fun but did find that the dates following some Bond movie titles were incorrect.

In conclusion, despite some minor problems and one major problem, I found that this documentary is a good way to increase your ""Bond, James Bond"" I.Q.
