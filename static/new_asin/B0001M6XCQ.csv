8014708,4,B0001M6XCQ,"The Killing of Randy Webster, 1981 film

It is night, sirens sound. A seventeen year old was shot and killed in 1977 Houston. People use CB radio to talk to other people. Can you believe what a stranger tells you? Randy Webster is sent to live with his father (he was suspended from school). Randy has a behavior problem. Life is not a picture show says his father. He joins the Navy. [Note the empty stores, the Ford Recession was ongoing. Did his parents divorce have an effect on him?] Randy decides to go to Houston to celebrate. But he does a crazy action at an auto dealer! The Houston Police call Mr. Webster to tell him the news. Was he on drugs? No, but he drank. Randy was shot in the left occipital. From behind? Mr. Webster talks to Amy, what does she know? His parents go to Houston to investigate. Mr. Webster reads the police report, the coroners report was misplaced. The blood test showed no alcohol or drugs. There is something wrong. Where did that cab driver go?

They go to the Grand Jury. A reporter from the Texas Monthly speaks to them. There have been a number of police shootings. That cab driver tells Mr. Webster what he saw: the police just shot the driver of that stolen car. The Civil Rights Division is interested in this case. The autopsy report was received. Randy was shot in the back of his head while on the ground! The Federal Civil Rights office will look into this case. The gun said to belong to Randy was unloaded. His friend said Randy had been up 24 to 36 hours without sleep. [Pep pills?] The Federal Grand Jury hears the testimony of the police. Was a throw down weapon used? No. The Federal Attorney traces the sale records from 1964. The police took the gun after the owner died! The police records say it was melted down! The case is reopened.

Mr. Webster talks to Amy Williams about what happened; they had argued. One of the police officers is questioned, and offered immunity. He asks for a lawyer. Then he speaks in court about the shooting. The cab driver saw everything. They will use a throw down as justification. We see what they did. The boy died before the ambulance arrived. The police officers were found not guilty of violating Randys civil rights, but two policemen were found guilty of perjury and given five years probation. There was another judgment against them.

There is a lesson in this story. Those who should learn from this probably wont. It shows the importance of family cohesion, and the problems that can result from a broken family. There are other examples but they won't make a movie about them.",1455148800,,2578,4.5257510729613735
8014709,3,B0001M6XCQ,"Unlike other commentators, I knew Randy Webster.  Randy was 1 or 2 years younger than me.  We were friends, primarily through a common friend I knew very well (and still know). In fact, I knew Randy's older brother pretty well. He is not mentioned; I can only assume why. I had a lot of respect for his older brother, and I truly hope he is still alive and well; the odds are against this. The point is Randy, not his brother. What is truly sad for me is I am pretty confident I was the last person to see Randy alive in our home town, Shreveport, LA. This was 1975, give or take a year. I saw him at a liqour store, coming out after buying some beer or Crown Royal (for many of us, the drink of choice in those days). It was a Friday night. We were both alone. I said (I am paraphrasing all in quotations) ""Hey Randy, what's up"". He replied ""I'm leaving for Houston to see some friends"". He might  have said his ""girlfriend"", I forget which. Now you must know it took at least 4-4.5 hours to drive there, and most of it was on US-59, which was a VERY dark and winding highway (probably still is). I told him, ""Randy, why don't you wait until tomorrow; 59S s#&ks!"" He said ""I need to go now"". I wished him well, and watched him drive off on Kings Highway. The next thing I heard was maybe 2 days later: ""Did you hear about Randy Webster? He's dead; he was shot dead by the Houston Police"". I also heard the police used a throw down pistol. I was mortified. I have lost many, many friends from my youth, mostly due to self destruction. By this I mean alcohol, drugs, suicides, car accidents while under the influence, etc. Especially 4 or 5 very close friends, and I mean close like we lived together close. However, I haven't known very many who have been shot dead by the police, but I have known a few. Randy was the first. I was about 21 and he must have been 19 or so. He was a young, kind hearted kid just feeling his oats. He was NOT a violent person, and I assure you he did not have a gun or guns.  Hal Holbrook is a fine actor. I didn't know Mr. Webster (Randy's father), but Mr. Holbrook was a good choice to play him. I forgot Sean Penn was even in this film. However, I knew Randy, and I know he would never use a gun, much less point one at a police officer. He was murdered, and not a single person (policeman) ever did a dayin prison for shooting Randy. I know his father spent a lot of money trying to get to the truth. I think he did, but he didn't get closure, in my opinion.",1428278400,4,2493,4.0920245398773005

I'd give it a five star review, even if there are dorks out there that side with crooked cops, and even in this days & age, there are still many of them.",1425340800,4,246,3.660377358490566
