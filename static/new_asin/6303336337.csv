626284,4,6303336337,"THE REDHEAD FROM WYOMING would have been just another B-movie western without the sublime Maureen O'Hara in the starring role.  Thanks to her, the film is quite memorable and the entire affair never wears out it's welcome (playing out in a brisk 80 minutes).

Manipulative politician Jim Averell (William Bishop) calls in his old flame Kate Maxwell (Maureen O'Hara) to manage his saloon and maverick-branding business.  But unbeknowst to Kate, she's actually going to play the fall guy for Jim's illegal cattle rustling operation.

Maureen O'Hara and her luminous beauty seemed to be custom-made for the Technicolor cameras.  She parades in some eye-catching costumes and acquits herself well with the material.  During her glory days with Universal Pictures, Ms O'Hara specialised in florid 'Arabian Nights' fantasies (""Bagdad"", ""Flame of Araby""), and unusual westerns (""The Deadly Companions"", ""The Rare Breed"").  REDHEAD might just be the best of her western appearances.

The supporting cast includes Alex Nichol as the sympathetic sheriff; Alexander Scourby, Robert Strauss, Gregg Palmer, Jeanne Cooper, Dennis Weaver and Stacy Harris.  The DVD includes the trailer.",1186704000,8,1171,5.570621468926554
626285,1,6303336337,"A voiceover opening, with Winston Hoch's outstanding camerawork of calf roping and branding onscreen, is a promising beginning and describes the setting for this film in 1870s Wyoming Territory, aboil with open range cattle raising and rustling, stimulated by the Territory's Maverick Law which permitted settlers to brand calves as their own if they were not within the confines of deeded property. When the voiceover ends the scenario begins, and that is a pity as it is woeful, approaching unintentional pastiche of the genre, with a fast-moving series of scenes lacking development, motivation and narrative continuity helpful to a viewer. An obvious vehicle for the beautiful Maureen O'Hara, splendid in Technicolor with her flaming red hair and green eyes, the piece unfortunately places her acting shortcomings to the fore, although she does her own stunt work, as is her wont. Alex Nicol is miscast as a laconic sheriff and Alexander Scourby is a bit too elegant for his role as a principal landowner, but William Bishop makes something interesting of his part as the film's primary villain, although his dialogue is no more penetrating than that of any other cast member. The plot deploys O'Hara as Kate Maxwell, a dance hall diva who is set up as proprietress of a saloon by her former lover, Jim Averill (Bishop) so that he may utilize her place of business as a front for rustling cattle, whereupon Kate is rent by her dual attraction to Averill and to the sheriff, who is taking steps to oppose this criminal enterprise. Director Lee Sholem, a straight ahead sort, is not given to varying of moods within his pictures, and that is the case here, resulting in a cursory and literal reading of the puerile script. Edward Stevenson's costumes for O'Hara are striking and appropriate and master make-up artist Bud Westmore does not have his craftsmanship disturbed by her riding and shooting activity, which is of a piece with the others in the colorfully garbed cast, whose raiment is barely disturbed by violent goings-on; indeed, the players often appear to be about to launch into song and dance, turning this affair into a musical of sorts, which might have been an improvement. The film includes the debut of Jeanne Cooper and an early effort of Dennis Weaver, atypically portraying a hard case, and somehow Robert Strauss is included in this one, completely out of place. Despite crisp editing, REDHEAD seems to take a long while arriving at its predictable ending, and although the cast never seems the worse for wear from its exertions, the viewer certainly will be, during this motivationless attempt to cast light upon a significant segment of Western American history.",1117238400,,2689,5.017897091722595
626286,3,6303336337,"In what seems more a showcase for Maureen O'Hara and a warehouse full of spectacular Technicolor costumes than anything else, Universal's 1953 THE REDHEAD FROM WYOMING is a pleasant enough range-war horse opera.

 O'Hara plays a saloon owner and the `friend' of an ambitious and manipulative politician who arranges to have her act as buyer for the strays rounded up by ever burgeoning population of wranglers.  Or rustlers, as the established and beleaguered local cattle baron would have it.  Rustlers in this context being both a fighting and a hanging word.

 It can be argued that Maureen O'Hara was the most beautiful movie star of the `50s.  At least you won't hear a nay from this corner.  O'Hara's sensuality, or meal ticket if you will, was more inward looking, more introspective and defensive than others.  O'Hara simply didn't project that sensuality as naturally as, say, her contemporary Jane Russell.  In a few early scenes this movie has her play the brash and brazen ""set-em-up-boys"" frontier dame, scenes which are embarrassingly unconvincing.  Heck, O'Hara looks embarrassed playing flirty-flirty.  The situation improves significantly as the movie progresses. O'Hara shucks her Technicolor gowns for Technicolor wrangling duds, hits the range and spends pretty much the rest of the film imposing her feminine will on a succession of strong willed men.  In other words, after a couple of shaky opening scenes, the movie scoots its star back into her comfort zone and keeps her there till they roll the closing credits.

  Universal didn't exactly stock REDHEAD with a galaxy of stars.  O'Hara's love interests in this are William Bishop, who plays the opportunistic politician fomenting a range war between the newcomers and the entrenched order and Alex Nicol is the cowpoke who drifted into a sheriff's job and does his best to thwart Bishop's nefarious plans.  There's a noticeable lack of chemistry between O'Hara and Nicol, mostly because Nicol's take on his role ranges from laconic to catatonic.  For oldies television buffs a very young Dennis Weaver (Gunsmoke, McCloud) has a fairly sizable role as a young, firebrand wrangler.

THE REDHEAD FROM WYOMING is just good enough to recommend, not quite good enough to urge or insist upon.",1094774400,3,2262,5.162087912087912

7843814,4,6303336337,"In the decade of the 1950s the Frontier Western was king...the most popular of all genres. There were some average B-Westerns; some good Westerns, some great ones and the absolute best...I don't think I've ever seen a bad Western from the 50s. This is one of the good ones, made a couple of clicks better by the fiery Irish redhead, Maureen O'Hara. All actors, if they wanted to work in the 50s, appeared in Westerns...O'Hara starred or co-starred in many. In a standard formula Western about a range war in Wyoming, the acting is generally quite good; but O'Hara is the only recognizable star...this is her movie. Alex Nicol costars as the sheriff caught between the two sides in the range war...and distracted by the beautiful newcomer in town...O'Hara. The two opposing sides are headed up by William Bishop as a crooked politician; and Alexander ""The Voice"" Scourby as a ranch baron. Bishop and Scourby were both New York/Brooklyn natives and spoke with undisguised accents...a bit disconcerting in a Western. In the support cast look for Dennis Weaver in his pre-""Gunsmoke"" days and Jack Kelly in his pre-""Maverick"" days. If you love Westerns and Maureen O'Hara as much as I do, you will love this one!",1477785600,,1207,4.864077669902913
