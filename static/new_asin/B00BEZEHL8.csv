5612715,1,B00BEZEHL8,"Poor filming, editing, directing, and acting. Don't waste your time on this ridiculous movie about organ stealing. We went thru it in fast forward.",1389052800,3,147,5.166666666666667
5612716,2,B00BEZEHL8,"This film builds upon the urban legend of organ harvesting. A group of friends with a camera head to Vegas for a birthday celebration...get lured by hookers who work for an organ harvester.

They took a lame plot and made it worse using a hand held camera for far too much of the film. Also listed as a ""comedy"" you won't find a lot of funny scenes. I did like the one scene where they film Capri (Nicole Sienna) talking to Luke (Josh Cole) from a distant and they dubbed in their voices. Outside of that, I was bored.

5612717,1,B00BEZEHL8,"Another god-awful camcorder horror movie, this time about four annoying twenty-somethings who go to Vegas as a 21st birthday celebration.  One naturally has a camcorder and records everything.  As is pretty much always the case with camcorder horror films the characters can't ever seem to stop talking even though they never have anything interesting to say.  (The most hilarious example of this is in the equally horrible camcorder horror flick Crow's Nest where the characters can't shut up even when they're trying to hide from the killers).  The endless chatter grows old fast and you want them to get killed just so they will shut the f**k up.  Once the friends drive to the remote location where they will be killed off by strippers there is no logical reason to continue the camcorder gimmick so the movie switches to an equally annoying surveillance camera gimmick with some shaky handheld camera work thrown in for no good reason since nobody is using the camcorder anymore.  It's probable that the murderous strippers are hot but the movie is so poorly shot and lit that it's hard to tell for sure.  Stripped has no gore or suspense and nudity that you can barely see--it's a thoroughly inept mess that nobody should waste their time on.",1368230400,18,1248,4.8584905660377355
5612718,1,B00BEZEHL8,"A group of friends head out to Las Vegas for a birthday bash that none of them are likely to forget... Or survive! The guys are lured off the Strip by some sexy strippers, only to be dissected by a murderous band of big-chested organ thieves. Unfortunately, what happened in Vegas didn't stay in Vegas, as STRIPPED makes its way home to DVD. STRIPPED is the latest hand-held disaster to hit the Horror genre, this time ripping off HOSTEL in the worst of all possible ways. The film truly does feel like a group of obnoxious 20-somethings just grabbed a camera and began filming their idiotic adventure in Vegas, which brings us to hate each and every character just minutes after they are introduced. Diligent viewers who make it long enough to see the murders will be let down again by the boring death scenes and the ridiculous killer. What doctor slowly stalks his victims as if he were some supernatural slasher? Director J.M.R. Luna breaks all of the rules of the ""found-footage"" genre by frequently switching to a third-person perspective in a failed attempt to heighten the tension. In the end, the only thing that is STRIPPED away is the audience's attention.

8567452,1,B00BEZEHL8,"This ""Hostel"" rip-off (without the gratuitous gore...at times it is so lame you would swear you were watching a Christian horror movie...yes, they exist) starts out like a ""found footage"" type of movie but ultimately gets so stupid with lack of continuity (like in the end with the female lead running around with the camera in her face and then you see a cut to a security camera with no hand held camera.)

The best part of the movie seeing the opening dialogue with Criswell from ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (uncredited in the credits. Does Wade Williams know about this?)

Basically 4 friends head to Las Vegas for a 21 run (one of the friends, the actor ""Graham"", didn't want his name in the credits.) They pick up the female lead as she's meeting her poser boyfriend in LV. The find a card for an escort service (first in a toilet stall & then on their windshield) and decide they want to go there to party. They make their way to the warehouse, start drinking and then are killed by a ""doctor"" who looks like the nerdy guy in the Seinfeld ""Lucy/Elaine steals Frank Costanza's TV Guide"" episode. The female lead (after finding out poser boyfriend had sex with a prostitute) goes to the 4 guys hotel room, finds escort card, and assumes they went there, goes to warehouse, and gets killed.

One scene shows the woman (you think, not really, that's she's giving oral) but removes his heart for harvesting. I guess they go through the pants to remove the heart?

There are other shots of a Reno news crew showing some footage of an organ harvesting victim? It's not explained. It's also not explained why it's in Reno and not Vegas where the movie takes place. They try to use 1 second scenes of the leads screaming as transitions well before the hit the strip. You never really see them screaming when they are finally being killed.

The lone positive is the acting is surprisingly good in the main leads. Too bad lame gore, originality, and lack of continuity are all over this.",1416960000,,1981,4.553370786516854
8567453,1,B00BEZEHL8,This has got to be the dumbest movie ever made --- one of the dumbest. I am so sick of these camcorder horror movies about people being killed while they record it on their cell phone or camcorder. Please think before you do this. And I am going to think before I watch another one of this type of movie. Only problem -- they have a cool looking cover and you think you are getting a movie that might be good. Then you get into it and you can't wait to hit the stop button. Waste of time. I got through the first 5 minutes and realized how bad this was.,1409529600,,553,3.990990990990991
8567454,1,B00BEZEHL8,"What a ridiculously stupid movie!
They show doctors looking at completely normal x-rays and believe this obviously healthy woman has some horrible disease. Incidentally the x-rays they look at can't possibly be the patient's, the abdominal x-ray is of an obese woman, and the other chest x-Ray is of a man! Obviously these directors, screen writers and prop people put as little effort into accuracy, as they did into the plot of this supposedly tittlating thriller.",1408838400,,466,5.144736842105263
