4683321,5,B005FNLVHI,"I bought this because I used to be an in-shape runner.  So, I decided to regain my physical fitness.  After the first week, I am truly impressed!  The PT24/7 works!!!  My arms feel tighter and so does my back, butt, legs, and abs.  Yes, my entire body was sore after three days, and you do feel/see the results  and it has only been a week.  I strongly recommend this workout system.  It will kick your butt, but you will achieve the results you want.  I give Billy 5 stars.  The bands, gloves, and straps are very durable and 30 minutes of intense training with Billy Blanks is more than enough to get my body back! Money well spent. :-)",1326758400,5,638,4.285714285714286

4683324,3,B005FNLVHI,"I should of known, but bought this thinking I was getting something else. Billy Blanks, a martial artist, goes into this tape with a heavy emphsis on punches and kicks in various arobic ways. I like zumba better, but must admit that I have not seen all the dvd's on the Billy blanks offering. Different strokes for different folks, but to me not my cup of tea.",1325894400,,360,4.388059701492537
4683325,4,B005FNLVHI,"We have had this and have been using it for about 6 weeks.

I have to say up front that I bought this product direct from its own website, after seeing a TV ad for it.  I had an old Tae Bo tape (yes tape LOL) in my home workout rotation, so I knew I liked Billy Blanks already.  One of the most important considerations in buying this is that my husband and I planned to use it together, so I knew bouncy annoying female instructors with peppy music and lots of choreography was not going to fly!  Another important consideration was that I knew we could not get Insanity, because we both have some minor knee issues from years of running.  I considered P90X (we are both in pretty good shape already) but didn't like the idea of many pieces of equipment kicking around my 5-kid-and-a-dog house, and having to change them out during a workout.

When I saw the ad for 24/7, I admit I jumped and ordered it immediately.  It looked like the perfect answer for our needs and limitations.  By ordering direct from the website, I got an extra pair of gloves, shoe straps, and resistance bands free, and the opportunity to order a third for $9.99.  I didn't, but now kinda wish I had because my daughter wants to use it!

A previous reviewer claimed the velcro on the shoe straps is weak and they don't stay on.  I have no idea what she is talking about, because ours have very strong velcro and always stay on.  In fact, the velcro is so strong that even after six weeks of use, my husband still sticks to the carpet!  I can hear his feet lifting as he steps.

In my opinion, the best workouts in the set are the Body Blast and Combo Sculpt.  Boot Camp Power and Ripped Core are my second favorites.  The Basics disc is something you use 2 or 3 times until you are up to speed, and then really not again, unless you want or need an easy day but don't want to do nothing at all.  Between Cardio Burn and Cardio, I would say Cardio Burn is the better of the two, but I have to admit to not much liking either one.  Some of the combos are awkward when trying to do them fast, and there is too much walking back and forth and side to side.  Billy seems to forget we are in our living rooms, surrounded by furniture and with limited space.  We have adapted so that we do the exercises without leaving our floor positions.  Another thing to look out for would be your animals.  My poor dog took a kick to the face full force this morning because he got curious and I didn't see him in time.

I am trying to get us to the point where we use this everyday, but to be honest, we have averaged three days a week.  And yet we still both got through the holiday season without gaining any weight.  That says a lot right there.  And I cook, real food, including homemade eggnog full of cream and booze, cookies, gravy, and full fat cheese.  So we are certainly not eating diet food, yet we got through the time of year most people put on 6-8 pounds, without gaining any, and only using this program 3x a week.

Some people might think that only half an hour is not really enough to get a good workout.  That is why the bands are genius.  They increase the intensity level of every movement, and give you resistance training at the same time you burn fat and calories.  That increased intensity level is why you can exercise for only half an hour but still get a good workout.  The fact that the bands are attached to you, so you don't have to hold onto them, is a feature I really like.  Your wrists don't start to hurt from having to hold and control a handle.  They seem to me to be the same quality as what I used at the gym.  The smaller time commitment on this has also made it easier for my husband and I to get it done before he leaves for work.  If you can't stick to it, even the best program won't do anything for you.

I bought this as a replacement for a gym membership I could no longer afford.  I spent the last year getting my butt kicked by an instructor I loved, and this program's best workouts give me approximately the same intensity level.  I sweat, I get sore, and I can see that the muscle tone and slimming I achieved are being maintained.  There are pushups and planking in this program.  There are burnouts in this program.  There are lunges, military presses, and bicep and tricep curls in this program.  No one could call it half-assed.  I am very satisfied and would happily spend the $90 to get this again.

If I am so thrilled, then why only four stars you ask?  Good question.  There are a few small things I am not thrilled about.  I will detail them here.  First, stretching is woefully neglected in this program.  For people who know how to take care of themselves, this is not a huge issue.  But I would hate to see a novice get injured because of the lack of stretching.  There are a few token hamstring stretches, but that's it.  Second, at times Billy stops to talk for too long, and the intensity level suffers because you end up stopped for too long.  Third, be prepared to hate the blonde chick to his left.  She's scary skinny and overacts her exertion level ALL THE TIME.  She is SO annoying... I just want someone to hold her down and feed her a cheeseburger.  To Billy's credit, though, there are a couple of people in his workout groups who are NOT all toothpicky and super-cut.  They look like normal people who are in shape, but still live life.  So hooray for that.  And fourth, I don't find it motivating to have the instructor say, ""three more sets"" and then at the end of that say ""one more set""  and ""last one"" to add on.  At times he will do that and then add more again!  Just be honest with me about how many we are doing, because I am trying to follow you and keep up!  I do find the notices at the bottom of the screen telling you how close you are to finishing helpful.  They start appearing at 50% and then continue to 75%, 85% and 95% done.  That can be very motivating when you are having a hard morning.  Finally, if you are on carpet, you have to pay very close attention and make sure you are pivoting on your rear toe correctly when twisting to throw punches.  If you don't, you will be torquing your knees a LOT and that is a very bad thing.

Finally a couple of little things that really aren't criticisms of the program, just unavoidable things that come with how the program is constructed.  As I mentioned before, the velcro on the straps is pretty strong.  The straps are designed to fit a wide range of shoe sizes, so for people like us who fall in the smaller medium range of shoe sizes, there is a lot of exposed velcro left over.  It sticks to the carpet and picks up stuff like dog hair.  It doesn't affect anything, it's just a little gross.  We just make sure that the same spot is always down (which happens naturally anyway because your feet and shoes don't change, right?) so that the clean part we use to secure the straps stays clean and functional.  The gloves will start to smell a little after a week or two of use.  You sweat in them, so they get a little funky.  Again, it's not horrible or anything, but it's there.  We thought about using Febreze, but they are made of fairly cheap vinyl with some kind of lining, and I am not sure if repeated use of Febreze would start breaking something down.  We leave them where they can air out, and it has not gotten bad enough for me to do anything about it yet.  Eventually I will rinse them well with plain water and leave them to air dry.  Cheap as they are, I have no concerns about durability.  I expect them to last a long time, along with the bands and straps.

Wow this got long.  Sorry about that, but I wanted to be clear and detailed.  I think this program is an outstanding contribution to at home workout options.  If you are really out of shape it will kick your butt, and if you are already in pretty good shape it will help you maintain.",1325808000,240,7867,4.2263263935527196
4683326,3,B005FNLVHI,"I was excited to get PT 24/7 because I longed for a workout that combined boxing with strength, resistance, cardio, core, etc. Now don't get me wrong - PT 24/7 does all the above. How effective it is feels yet to be determined.

For one, I'm still not convinced the bands are even needed for these workouts. I've used them sparingly thus far, mostly because the cheap velcro design that goes around the shoes means you have to start and stop the workout constantly to reattach or readjust them. I got frustrated by the end of the first workout and will be perfectly honest -- this is a very poor design. The material is inexpensive - obviously so - and there's no reason these velcro straps shouldn't be made of something more practical like rubber or elastic that slide right over the shoe.

Secondly, the 'basic' workout with this DVD isn't really needed. If you don't have any idea what a jab or an uppercut it, you shouldn't have purchased the product anyway. Hearing Billy explain it 20-30 times while his crew shouts a random variety of ""Yes sir!"" and ""Wooo!"" after every move even begins to make *you* feel a little silly. That chatter continues for the entire series, and while distracting, it takes away from something else and that's Billy's interaction with his real audience. He gets so focused on trying to motivate and encourage the people around him, it doesn't quite feel like his attention is really on the people in their living room trying to follow along.

Finally, I feel the need to mention that the best workout in the box is the ripped core. If you take it to the intensity they do on the DVD, you'll get results. I have and I've dumped the resistance bands from the workout completely. But 30 minutes a day isn't going to cut the mustard if you're serious about changing your lifestyle, and Billy doesn't mention during these routines that diet and other forms of exercise *must* be part of your 24-hour cycle. (Yes, there's a meal planner of sorts in the box but it's not overly helpful. This is the kind of information you're going to have to seek from other places)

I'm glad I got this product at half price. It's certainly not worth the $80 Billy peddles it for on his website. Not unless they change the design of the velcro straps to something more practical, then change the workout from a group lesson to the one-on-one that it was probably intended to be.",1324944000,31,2390,4.564102564102564
4683327,5,B005FNLVHI,"I'm glad that Billy has come out with PT 24/7. It's a good program. The bands really makes a difference. I know that Billy has other workouts that he uses bands, but not like these. You use the bands for all the workouts and up until the last couple of minutes, before Billy tells you to take them off and have you do the moves without the bands, so that you can feel the difference. You will notice how light you feel and how fast you are.

These workouts are only 30 minutes, but they all pack a punch. Billy did a great thing with combining his moves with resistance training.

If you are a fan of Billy Blanks and all his workouts, you will love PT 24/7. This program will take you to another level of Tae Bo.",1324166400,37,713,4.122302158273381
4683328,4,B005FNLVHI,"These workouts range from ""okay"" to ""good"".  Nothing great about them, but definitely worth the price since I wanted a little more variety in my exercise routines.  The bands are pretty gimmicky, but aren't really needed.  I prefer a weighted vest and/or boxing gloves for a little resistance.  And as others have said, Billy really does a poor job of counting/keeping time.",1450915200,,374,4.983870967741935
4683329,1,B005FNLVHI,"Miss the old style workouts with Billy Blanks.  The bands don't make sense.  Spent more time getting tangled in them then doing the workout.  Now it sits on my shelf and I enjoy my workout with Shaun T ""Focus T25"".",1449100800,,214,4.3
4683330,5,B005FNLVHI,"I have been such a fan of Billy Blanks and all his work out videos. Since I was in high school! I originally did the boot camp Tae bo, and several other workouts that had weighed bars and elastic straps. I do have to say I really like these straps much better. I don't have to worry about slipping and sliding while holding the little handle bar that I had to in the past. The gloves are easy to put on and the foot straps are easy to adjust and have never come close to sliding off. 30 minute work outs are easier to convince myself to do too. 45 minutes to an hour is hard to convince a body to work out for that long without having a reward of ice cream or something as compensation. I have been using it when my schedule allows and I have seen some amazing toning in my arms and legs. The tension on the bands are just enough to really give you a good workout but not had enough to make your arms useless the rest of the day. I will continue to follow Billy and his work. He really takes the time to make a proper exercise routine.",1440806400,,1035,4.004830917874396

4683358,4,B005FNLVHI,"I've loved Billy since I first started using Tae Bo 15 years ago in college. This video has a lot of the moves from the original, but the resistance band add that extra intensity. I've been using it for 3.5 weeks, following the workout calendar religiously. I haven't noticed much in weight loss, but have had inches lost and legs,arms, and back feel tighter. I love that it's 30 minutes, I don't have time for much more.  Billy does count some sets incorrectly. He'll say, 2 more sets! And you end up doing like 4 more. I don't know if this his way of messing with your brain to do more, of if he truly loses count while talking. A few moves you also do 3 sets on one side, and only one on the other. But overall, great video, I like that his daughter still does videos with him!

The workouts are intense, and might be a bit overwhelming for the beginner.  However, if you go at your own pace and do the exercises correctly, you will gain the stamina to get through.  I like this system, because it focuses on strength training with movement so I get my cardio in as well.  The bands and straps can be a bit cumbersome to put on, but after using them a few times I got the hang of it, and they really do help in the workout.

The only negative I can share is the fact that Billy has an issue with tempo and sometimes gets off cadence, which throws some of his pupils off in the video, and sometimes myself as well, but it gives me something to laugh at while I am working out.  I mean, exercise should be fun, right?

4683374,4,B005FNLVHI,This workout is NOT for beginners such as myself. The gloves were much too big for me so I do not use them. I gave it 4 stars because my husband use it and it's a pretty cool workout for someone who is a regular at it. I have only done the first 2 myself. The Basics and Cardio. My Honey came up with the idea to hook the bands to my shoes and use the foot wraps on my arms. Works out really well so he use the gloves and just hook the bands to his shoes as well. Overall the workout does what it suppose to do. I really like Mr. blanks and plan to get through the whole PT at some point!,1397433600,,588,3.712

4683378,5,B005FNLVHI,I love this workout DVD series. I was very out of shape when I started it and now after 8 months I have lost 40 pounds and I'm in pretty good shape. The resistance bands are a must. Mine did just break recently but now there are so many bands available to buy that I replaced them. You can also increase the intensity of the workout with heavier resistance bands if you would like. There are a couple of cardio video's and toning video's. Each is 30min and you will get out of it what you put in. It was a workout that I initially was able to do (being badly out of shape) and now I put more and more effort into the video and get more of a workout out of it. With healthy eating (not dieting) and doing this workout 3 or 4 times per week I am looking and feeling great! I would recommend this to anyone trying to live a healthier lifestyle.,1396224000,6,841,4.041916167664671

4683380,3,B005FNLVHI,"I really was excited to get this set,as I loved the older TaeBo Bootcamp workouts that came with a band. I was excited that these dvds featured short workouts,as I enjoy doing a second workout in the evening but am usually too tired to do an hour long dvd. The first 1 or 2 times that I used these,I thought they were ok,but the more I compared them to my older TaeBo,the more they just didn't hold up. I did not feel challenged by any of the dvds in this set,and some were just downright easy. Bootcamp Power was just a mixture of dull and silly. I wound up selling these on EBay. If you can still find the set of TaeBo Bootcamp with bands that came out I believe in 2004,it would be a much wiser purchase.

4683387,5,B005FNLVHI,"Although I grew up on Tae Bo, I wasn't sure if I wanted to get back into it with the hassle of bands, gloves, and velcro. Several of the reviews here really threw me off and made me doubt the effectiveness of PT 24/7, but I decided to take a risk. It completely paid off!

Let's address some other things you might see in lower ratings right off the bat:

1. ""The gloves are too big; the gloves are uncomfortable; the gloves are made with hazardous materials..."" - Yes, the gloves are a little large and are one size fits all, but they are not made for wearing to the gym or having slumber parties. These gloves are there for two reasons - to hold the bands in place and keep you focused during the workout. Regarding the last bit - most things are made with hazardous materials. If wearing the gloves was a real threat, then the program wouldn't be legal. It's just like seeing a warning label for eggs and peanuts on a protein bar.

2. ""The velcro for your shoes is weak/sticky/annoying/uncomfortable/collects pet hair..."" - The solution is simple. Don't use it. The bands easily clip to your shoelaces.

3. ""Billy Blanks can't count properly; he does too many repetitions on some sides..."" - I think that it is a well-known fact that Billy Blanks has trouble counting. In these videos, however, that was a lot less frequent. To me, his occasional error makes the videos more gritty and real. He makes up for it by giving you 200%, always looking and speaking directly at you, and motivating you like a true personal trainer. Sometimes I even forget I'm watching a video. Just hearing him encouraging me to keep going is awesome during those moments when I feel I can't move any more. Yes, sometimes he does one too many sets on either side, but I've learned to compensate. It's not a deal-breaker by far.

4. ""The blonde woman in the front is annoying..."" - Yes, she definitely can be ""too much"" at first. She is clearly pumped up about the workout and really adores Billy, who I think is actually her adoptive father. However, the worst is only in the Basics video. After that, I found her obvious excitement to be motivational, and she helps Billy (and you) keep count. If you're ever lost, just look at her. She knows exactly what she's doing.

5. ""Do I really need the bands and gloves to get results? Can't I just do the workout without the hassle?"" - Yes, you can. But the bands are really amazing. Give them a try, and you won't be disappointed. As a 6 year Tae Bo veteran, I found the bands challenging me in new and awesome ways. You will always get results from Tae Bo, but with these bands you will achieve more strength, sculpt, and power.

6. ""I'm really out shape, and Billy Blanks doesn't take the time to explain the moves properly or do a warmup. You could throw out your back. You could pull a tendon. You could hurt yourself..."" - Yes, and you can get hit by a car if you step outside. It's true - Billy doesn't guide you through a proper warm up. Each DVD jumps right into the workout itself. If you are going to do any sort of exercise, make sure that you give yourself at least a 10 minute interval to warm up with stretches. Don't rush to keep up with the DVD right away. Do the moves at your own pace and most importantly listen to Billy. He does tend to get wordy sometimes, but he does explain how to make sure to avoid injury when doing his workout. The Basics DVD is crucial - do not skip it.

I am very much out of shape. A recent car accident took me out of the workout sphere for nearly 2 years. I struggled at first with these workouts, but after a week I started seeing a big difference. If I can do it, you can do it. Several negative reviews almost prevented me from buying this program. I wanted to write this to help others who are facing my dilemma. I am starting week 2 right now, and I feel great. You can too! Good luck.",1390176000,93,3864,4.32
4683388,3,B005FNLVHI,I was intrigued by the short 30 minute sessions.  Was hoping that it would be as good as T-25.  I am a fan of Billy Blanks but this ENTIRE series was developed around annoying bands.  I have used the videos without the bands and they become a decent beginners video series.

I wanted to get back to the basics in an exercise routine and this is perfect.  I didn't want a lot of hype or something that I wouldn't be willing to do 5 days out of the week.  The routines are varied but still solid exercise that make give you confidence in yourself and an overall feeling of accomplishment.  The resistance bands are a good added bonus and I think the gloves actually fit all adult hands (both myself and my son can wear them comfortably) in addition they are made to fit left and right hands equally.  I don't use the shoe strap - I just clip the lower clip of the resistance bands to my laced shoestrings and they work perfectly.  My only concern is that I am going to wear out the resistance band.

I just stand there and do the kicks instead of jumping, it's better than just doing nothing. I use my own resistance bands, so I can't comment on the gloves or the resistance bands that come with the DVDs. I really like these workouts since they are only 30 minutes. It's gets me moving, if you do the kicks and punches right, you will see results. He also likes to do push-ups which is my least favorite exercise but he doesn't do them in all the DVD's so I wouldn't worry about it.

4683406,2,B005FNLVHI,"I have to start by saying that I was very excited to get this product! As someone who was looking to get back into shape after three years of not working out and an individual who LOVES martial arts, I thought this would be fun!

Included Gloves Review - When I first got the kit, I went home and opened it right away. The first thing I noticed is that the bands were VERY long. I am 5' 10"" and have a ""normal"" build. When I put the bands on my hands and shoes, there was A LOT of slack. When I started using them; however, I found the resistance to be perfect. If you need more tension, you can simply wrap the bands around your gloves once while you use them without them getting in the way too much.

As for the gloves themselves, they are okay. They aren't made of premium materials; however, they don't feel cheap either. They are easy to put on and tax off and just happened to be the perfect size for my hands! Having the clips attach near the wrists also helps keep the bands out of the way and is the perfect spot.

My only issue is with the actual clips on the bands. The clips are VERY cheap! Several times when really getting into a workout, I found them popping off. There is nothing like going to punch/kick and you expect resistance, then, suddenly your band flings out and you end up punching/kicking like you are falling! It's kind of like when you are a kid and you are pulling a rope, and suddenly the other person lets go. Not fun!

Workout Program Review - This is where PT 24/7 loses a lot of points and falls flat on its face!

Warm-ups - First, I have to point out that PT 24/7 has little to no warm-up workouts! If you plan on doing this program, you better have your own warm-up plan! The lack of warm-ups combined with the types of activities you are doing in PT 24/7 make it a recipe for pulls and strains!

Workout - The actual workouts in this program are good. There is a good variety and it never really feels dull.  You have a variation of kicks, punches, combos and other cardiovascular exercises. The pace is decent as a whole; however, there are some issues with how the workouts are actually executed.

First, you typically get an example when you are doing something ""different"" like a combo. Billy shows you what to do slowly, and then you start doing it. The issue is with the pace. You start off going VERY slow, and then go to VERY fast! There is little to no gradual increase to get you used to the pace. What this meant for me is that I ended up hurting my back when doing a combo kick.

Next, I really feel that Billy either needs to learn to count or he needs to be clear in his sets. I understand the concept of telling someone they need to do 2 more sets, and then saying ""One more set!"" just to keep people going. A lot of personal trainers do this. My issue is, sometimes he will say two more sets, and then stop you after one. Other times, he will say two more sets, and then have you do four more. It's very inconsistent. I almost feel like there is someone behind the camera telling him to speed up or slow down his workout based on the allotted time!

Next, I didn't really care for the form of his workouts. As someone who has taken martial arts and who has worked with personal trainers before, I understand that form is VERY important! Often times, Billy will show you how to do something, and then start adding things on as you do it without properly explaining the true form first! Imagine getting half way through a round of four sets only to find out that you weren't taught the correct form to begin with! It's very annoying!

I have read other reviews from people who complain about the constant counting during the workouts. I have no issues with this because it helps remind you to breath. Frequently, I have been working out and watched people start to get very red because they focus more on their workout than their breathing. Counting forces you to breath out which actually promotes a better workout (you engage your core, allow oxygen to flow, etc.).

Cool-downs - Unlike the warm-ups where there is roughly 1 minute of stretching, there is NO cool-down time in these DVDs and no mention of cooling down/stretching after a workout! Instead, you get a speech about ""giving it your all"" and ""not listening to others who ask you why you are working out"" for roughly 1-2 minutes. These speeches are okay; however, I don't understand why he can't do them while going through a cool-down period.

Just like doing warm-ups, cool-downs help prevent pulls and strains. I really wish Billy had spent more time on these!

Conclusion - As a whole, I was VERY disappointed by this workout program. I guess I now understand why it is so cheap in comparison to other workout programs that come with nothing but the DVDs.

If you are looking for a good workout program to get you back into shape, I would recommend looking elsewhere. As I stated, this program feels incomplete and rushed at times just to make sure the workouts stay under 30 minutes.

I think Billy needs re-work this and make it complete. Also, there needs to be a phased workout plan. There needs to be a basic training time to teach you the punches, kicks, form and combos while allowing you time to get things kick started. After a few weeks, Billy should up the intensity and make workouts more difficult. The concept of using the gloves/bands for tension training is great! The workouts/pace themselves, not so much!

Nice try I guess!

On the bright side, even the back injury didn't completely stop me from working out; it simply set me back a couple of weeks! I have lost 30+ pounds doing my own workout program and feel great! I like it more because I can choose what I want to do!",1366156800,3,5713,4.36852026390198
4683407,3,B005FNLVHI,"I'm between okay and like it. It's a bit early to decide between the two. Maybe I liked the tae-bo (13 years ago) better, because it was a bit easier, without the gloves, but I was also 13 years younger then, everything was easier.

Cons: Not enough abs in the mix--I need to supplement with my own ab workout, occasionally more reps on one side than the other, in one of the videos BB goes on a super-weird, long rant about being strong (i.e. ""Imagine someone's life depends on you doing one more pushup...what would you do?"" and ""someone's trying to take your kids away unless you do x pushups!"") which is actually pretty entertaining so perhaps it's actually a pro.",1364947200,3,697,4.576

4683410,5,B005FNLVHI,"Been doing Tae Bo for quite some time now. As usual this new exercise plan tries to address supposed issues with the earlier generations of Tae Bo. Thinking this would work very well for beginners or experienced exercisers.

Lately he's tightened up on the folks in the back.  There are fewer and they are more in step. There are new younger folks and a mix of the taeboers from the 2000s. Continuity and freshness,... check.

All the DVDs are within a few minutes of 30 minutes, so it's a good step towards what people want in this time starved world that we are a part of. The bands help to add a notch to the workout so it still feels like a great workout.

Most of the time is focused on combinations of punches and kicks, so it works in a smaller space than many of his older dvds. He changes them up well, with a slow 'here's the right form' set, then some up tempo, then maybe multiples or mixing it with something else. So it feels like you aren't just changing exercises rapidly but developing them through variations.

The set has 7 dvds that work well as a coordinated exercise program, one is clearly a starter, but the others are all quite good for the rotation. There is a good mix in of variations on squat thrusts, pushups and situps, with virtually all exercises having the bands add tension and keeping a pretty good tempo. With the shorter workouts warmup and cooldown are minimized. Pace is more consistently up than many of his earlier dvds, you get to pace quicker and stay there longer.

This is my first Band program and I'm glad I tried it. ...however the gloves are starting to delaminate. The vinalish coating is pealing off the fabric between the fingers, not great... They still work but not sure for how long.  But after doing the month program frankly I've gone to using hand-weights as I did with his great boot-camp series, I like the resistance better and the moves all still make sense. I happen to use 3 lb weights but it's another advantage that you can pick whatever weight that works for you. So I'm not going to downgrade for the gloves.

Certain folks mention that the one size gloves are huge for them,... I'm pretty much an average size guy with average guy hands and I wouldn't want them any smaller. So one size fits all is a compromise at best.

There is a diet plan that is pretty tight on calories so thinking you'd have to loose weight with it, but I only do the exercises.  I have definitely tightened things up with this fantastic taebo series!  It's a great addition to my older library that I'll still rotate through when I have more time for a longer aerobic workout.

Excellent, great fun, would definitely recommend.",1362355200,2,376,4.463768115942029
4683414,3,B005FNLVHI,"we purchased this product over a year ago, I was hesitant to even bother with it, after doing the basics a few times and getting on board fully I quickly became addicted. So of the counts and combinations go a little to fast for me to catch up with but with my bad back etc. I was still eventually able to at least attempt and get through all the exercises. I loved the workouts plain and simple they were perfectly geared for my level. I had a lot of trouble doing the kicks and combinations because I am just not flexible enough to get my legs in the right postions but I gave it my best.

  The gloves and bands are pure crap, the snapped after about 4 months of use so becareful if you notice any cracking they will snap shortl htere after. we called the company for replacements and apparently they are not available anywhere without buying the entire set all over again. My wife contacted the company several times only to be reffered to someone else and on and on. She did however eventaully get to talk with Shelly who was just as unhelpful as all the rest had been.  Needless to say it got thrown out because of the shotty customer service. They know their product is cheap crap adn should at least care enough about their customers to provide support for them when they want to purhcase replacement bands. WE were told to check Wal-Mart.. Walmart does not offer anythign remotely close to the ""billy bands"" that would work withthis program.

  However I really enjoyed the exercises and it did make a difference in my posture. will it burn fat? sure it will, will you get ripped to shreds? no not a chance the resistance jsut is not enough strength to build the muscle. I would typically do one of the dvd's and then go straight to the treadmill and do another half hour run. I tis a good program to help get you loosened up for heavier training. I am thinking about buying another set but would like to see some replacement gloves, bands, velcro etc. I have missed coming home from work and knocking this out real quick and feeling great and stronger and better core strength.",1361232000,,2087,4.419270833333333

Unfortunately one of the bands broke and the workouts just aren't the same without them.  You don't work nearly as hard without the bands.

If you want to know where to go send me an email.  I love these workouts...they are very good, very hard...if you put your all into it, as with any other workouts.

4683436,5,B005FNLVHI,"After reading other reviews I'd like to comment on a few things. The gloves are big because it is a product being mass marketed to both male and female consumers so it's one size fits all with the male hand being served best. My hands are normal size for a woman, I wear a size 7 ring which is standard, and the gloves are big on me but I don't find it prohibits me from doing the work out. All the gloves really do is keep the bands on. I disagree strongly with the person who commented that the bands don't make the workout more intense. Clearly you've never used resistance bands which when used correctly are very effective. I've done a lot of kick boxing DVD's including Billy Blanks first Tae Bo videos and I find the bands make a huge difference in my muscle fatigue. You can wrap the bands around your hands to give it more resistance if that's what you need. The production on these tapes is a mess as are the participants, but that's true of all Billy Blanks DVD's. The whooping and hollering may be cool in a live class to get people fired up but in a DVD it's stupid and annoying! Most of the time I turn the volume off once I learn the routine and do it to my own music. I bought this for $20 on clearance at Target and I don't think it is worth $90 but I would pay in the range of $40 to $50 for it, but you have to know what you're getting with Billy Blanks. His moves and routines are great but his cues and productions are a mess. The gloves are big but unless your hand is really small this shouldn't be an issue. I have used a lot of different resistance band products over the years (avoid Everlast!) and I think these bands are good quality and the Velcro straps stay put on my sneakers without sliding. If you're an experienced exerciser who doesn't need your hand held through every move then it's a great work out. Again you just have to know what you're getting with Billy Blanks, as I mentioned I had his first Tae Bo videos and besides being less grainy the productions are still chaotic and amateurish.  However, the guy knows how to train and he has good routines and while I find a lot of the people in his DVD's irritating with their shouting and dopey ""I drank the Kool-Aid"" grins and I don't find him annoying. He seems very down to earth like a regular guy I'd expect to be teaching at a local boxing gym. I work out a lot and I like working out independently which is one of the reasons I exercise at home, if you're like me in that way and you enjoy kick boxing routines I think you'll really like this.",1351728000,18,2539,4.181632653061224

4683447,5,B005FNLVHI,I decided to lose some weight with diet and exercise. I was watching a show called the Doctors and saw Billy Blanks demonstrating PT 24/7. I thought it wound be a good idea to start my excercise program with something fresh and new like PT 24/7. It was just what I needed. There are so many different workouts you will not get bored doing the same workout.,1347494400,3,356,4.3283582089552235
4683448,4,B005FNLVHI,"I've enjoyed doing Tae Bo for about two years now and I was excited to buy the PT 24/7 from an eBay store seller last year, which I paid around $55 for it new. It came in a nice packaging box and in it was the two gloves, bands, velcro foot straps, a workout calendar, a diet guide book, and the 7 30 minute DVD workouts.

The workouts are:

Basics

Cardio

Combo Sculpt

Ripped Core

Boot Camp Power

Body Blast

Cardio Burn

The gloves are bulky and the first time I used them, the thumb holes cut into my hands. During the second week the gloves started to peel off in places, followed by the stitching breaking apart. The gloves are cheap made. Instead of sending them back I use the gloves from the Gold's Gym MMA Training Kit, which fit a lot better, giving me more movement in my hands for punching.

I noticed there are a few complaints about the velcro feet straps. I have had them about ten months and I have never had a problem, except for that they can stick to the carpet.

The Basic workout is to help you learn the moves and to get use to the bands. My favorite workouts are Combo Sculpt, Ripped Core, Boot Camp Power, and Body Blast.

If you use the bands correctly they give you the resistance you need to see changes in your body. I especially feel the difference in my shoulders and arms. I'm only 5'9 and the bands work perfectly for me. Someone who is shorter or taller may have problems with them.

I noticed some reviewers complain about the price. A single Tae Bo DVD can cost around ten dollars at Walmart or up to fifteen dollars on Amazon.com. In PT 24/7 you are getting 7 workouts, so if you bought them separately it would cost you at least seventy dollars, and that is without the gloves, bands, and the workout schedule.

Tae Bo may not be for everyone, but it works for me.",1347235200,8,1805,4.255131964809384
4683449,2,B005FNLVHI,"I would NOT recommend Billy Blanks PT 24/7.  I did the whole program from start to finish for weeks on end and I did not lose a single pound!!!!! I was not over weight to begin with I only wanted to lose about ten ponds and tone up, it did not do this for me. I am very disappointed in this product. While Billy is very motivational, the product it's self also has many flaws. I am 5 foot even, the bands were too long and I could not put and real strain on the bands. Secondly the gloves that came with it were also entirely too big and slid off of my wrists. There is no way to adjust the bands or the gloves to your body's needs. There are also no instructions on how to properly connect the place the bands and the Velcro foot bands stuck to my carpet when I was trying to work out.

I had no expectations other than knowing that I would definitely enjoy his class.  Well, the program turned out to be absolutely beyond my expectations with results in the very first 7 days (30 min class).  It is fun, has very good rythm, great interaction and motivation.  You don't need to start like crazy to see results, just starting at your own level, and making sure you do the exercises right,it works like a charm as Billy reinforces good technique every step of the way.  That's the key and it really shows.  I feel great inside out and recommend it to anyone that wants to see results.  It is brilliant",1343779200,17,774,4.326388888888889

4683455,4,B005FNLVHI,"I don't want to write a review that mimics everyone else's so lets just stay on the major points that everyone here is talking about.
Firstly, the blonde on the right, Shellie (Billy's adopted daughter) is NOT as annoying as everyone says. Maybe it is because everyone hyped it up so much, but she is so much in the background when she says ""Sir!"" that I hardly notice it. I mostly notice the ridiculously awesome burning my muscles are feeling because of the workout.

The gloves are as bad as everyone says. I mean, REALLY bad. Sure, I have small hands, but these things are SO GIGANTIC that I have to put 2 fingers in each finger whole to keep them from hurting from being spread out so far. I even tried tightening the wrist band as much as possible, but that didn't help. My suggestion: buy some MMA gloves that have an open palm, such as these Century ones:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Century-Open-Palm-Bag-Gloves-with-Clinch-Strap-tm/dp/B004CXZ17I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Century Open Palm Bag Gloves with Clinch Strap(tm)</a>&nbsp;I was able to get a pair of pink women's gloves in small/medium for less than $25 at Century's website. I put a keyring around each palm strap (try to find keyrings that are as smooth as possible so they don't tear at the stitching). These MMA gloves won't move around on you if you get the right size and make doing pushups MUCH easier since they are padded and stabilize you much more than the PT 24/7 gloves.

A lot of people complained that the stretch bands are too long for people who are short-statured. Well, I am 5 foot-5inches tall and the resistance is just fine for me! I've never felt they were too baggy or loose. If you DO find that they are, simply wrap the band around your palm once for added resistance.

The foot straps: yeah, I took everyone's advice and simply clipped the stretch bands straight to my shoe laces. I do these workouts on shaggy carpeting so I wasn't going to mess with bad velcro! I like attaching to the laces because I feel like I'm not always stepping on something (it just feels weird to me).

Overall, the videos are very fun and exciting to do. Expect similar punches and kicks as Billy Blanks' previous Tae Bo videos, but he throws more cross training moves in (pushups, situps, military presses, lunges, etc). If you are like me and have to do these workouts on shaggy carpets, do yourself a favor and keep a towel or yoga mat nearby. Some of the videos require you to lay down at the END when you are super sweaty. I dislike the feeling of carpet sticking to my skin.
Each video is approx. 30 minutes long (some a few minutes longer when Billy takes time at the end to pump you up to sticking with the routine). Don't get discouraged if you can't keep up with some of the moves (especially when they double the speed). You will get a workout just fine if you just go as fast as you can without losing your balance.

I gave this product a 4 star review because the workouts are awesome, but the equipment provided is made of super cheap materials that don't hold up.

UPDATE: December 2013
Still going strong! I'm loving my Century Gloves and they've held up with no problems using the key rings. The original bands that came with the video are also going strong with no signs of wear or breakage. If you do want to buy other bands, they are available online everywhere (just expect to pay about $15). I have discovered these videos are fun to do with others! I do them with friends and family now and everyone has lots of fun!",1339459200,23,3563,4.638668779714738
4683456,1,B005FNLVHI,"I am not particularly satisfied with this product for two reasons.  First, this is Tae Bo and nothing more.  The videos did not give me a great workout. I would do two workouts back to back to get a better work out. I was hoping for something much more strenuous.  The videos were professionally done and I am satisfied with that, however I am basing my opinion on the workout itself.  Second, the fitness bands provided were not great.  The velcro footband does not stay fastened well.  There should be a buckle there versus a thin velcro piece.  I fixed this by using a fitness band, tying it in a loop to put around my foot and attaching the fitness bands to them.

I think if you like Tae Bo you'll like this program.  If you are looking for something more like P90X or Insanity don't waste your money.  This is just my opinion.",1339286400,7,832,4.3441558441558445

4683491,2,B005FNLVHI,"I'm a month into this. I already was going to say that I don't like this as much as the past TaeBo programs, but now I'm making my review even more negative because my band snapped. And it snapped in a very painful way, smacking my chest (and leaving a big red mark right above one of my manboobs). I've had Taebo resistance bands before and each time they've broken, so this was my last try.

Now, as far as the workouts. Before the bands broke, I was going to write a review anyways, and I was going to say that the bands help, but without the bands, it'd be a mediocre workout. Oops. During this month, I felt like I was getting into slightly better shape, sweat a ton, but lost 0 weight. I think it can help people get tone, but it has a lot of flaws

It feels like things were rushed to get the DVDs to be 30 minutes (there is a plus to have each workout be the perfect amount of time to fit in, but that comes at a price). Because of this, you lose some attention to form, which I thought made a world of difference in the early Taebo programs. And it just makes Billy come off a little lazier (the bands are supposed to be your form guides, and they do keep you honest, but it's very easy to cheat with them without even realizing it. And with all that, for some reason, this program has given me the least effect of ""feeling it"" after). He also comes off a little meaner.

I think he's trying to copy the p90x/insanity/etc crazes. An example, many of the DVDs include or end with pushups and situps. That was a little annoying since that's the exact reason I'm doing Taebo and not just your traditional workout stuff. But even if I can live with that,  I still find too much of it to be mediocre. I felt myself getting used to going through the motions after repeating some of the DVDs. His early DVDs had me feeling it MUCH more after the workout. I paid too much for this :(",1337126400,7,1884,4.139344262295082

4683493,2,B005FNLVHI,"First was excited seeing this on ""The Doctors"" who made it sound like it was suited for anybody. This is not for beginners, and I'm not talking about strength or cardio fitness. It's very confusing watching, should be a mirror image like aerobic/yoga etc.. The yes sir etc... give me a break! It goes right into a fast routine, form be damned. To the idiot who thinks everyone should know all the punches, you sound just like my boss(everyone dislikes him).

4683494,3,B005FNLVHI,"I just got PT 233/7 in the mail today and was very excited to try it.
It arrived in a timely fashion and everything in the package was in good working order.
I have only had time to do the first video. Unfortunately, the chatter of the blond in
the front row--and possible others, reciting: ""Yes, sir,"" repeatedly throughout the video
to be very annoying and just plain silly. Worse that that, it distracted me from hearing the
instructions. The ""Yes, sirs"" cheapened Blank's good instruction and enthusiasm.
On the positive side, I believe I will benefit from the videos and I
got a good price of $49 on the internet. I really hope that the other videos are free
from the obnoxious, ""Yes, sirs,"" so I can fully enjoy them. I am hoping that I can fall in
love with this program (as I have with Zumba) but the jury is still out on that.",1336780800,,835,4.358974358974359
4683495,5,B005FNLVHI,I've been doing TaeBo for almost 9 years. I have most of Billy's products and enjoy using them. PT 24/7 is excellent and alot of punch is packed into a 30 minute workout. DO NOT ORDER IT FROM STANDING OVATION. One of the discs is defective and I contacted Standing Ovation 3 times via email and they DO NOT respond. STAY CLEAR OF STANDING OVATION AT ALL COSTS!

I originally lost about 50 lbs. with Billy's original VHS workout and I had great hopes for PT 24/7, but I feel he should have thought of a different strategy for these resistance bands and the velcro straps you have to attach to your shoes. Sorry, Billy.",1336348800,,381,4.7727272727272725
4683537,5,B005FNLVHI,The workout is very challenging since I workout I put duct tape on the portion of Velcro that is exposed to the carpet so it doesn't pick up the carpet fibers....On one of the videos I am just able to work out for the first 20 mins before I have to catch my breath on the others I still at 10-12 mins before I have to catch my breath....I Love it.,1335052800,2,347,3.9014084507042255
4683538,5,B005FNLVHI,"I had been using P90X for 2 cycles (6 months).  I got great results, however, began to get very bored of it.  It was very entertaining for a while.  However, very time consuming,also if you are following the P90X nutrition guide, very expensive.  A friend about a month ago let me borrow Billy Blanks Amped, and I instantly fell in love.  Because I like variety in my workouts I searched online and found PT 24/7.  Within the next few days I went and bought it at Walmart (which I would suggest for people, because some have complained about the shipping time.)  I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, following the calendar schedule and I love it.  The pros as opposed to P90X is that everything that you need to workout is included.  In P90 X you need bands, weights, and a pull up bar.  Tony Horton is very intense, however, I think I prefer working out with Billy Blanks.  As far as the bands go, some people have been speaking about the velcro straps.  What I did instantly because I could hear them starting to come apart, is putting them on and then attaching the bands to the inside of my shoe strings, so that they do not move.  For me, I have found this very helpful, and because I am short it seems to give me more resistance.  Another major plus is TIME.  P90X workouts range anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half.  I don't know about anyone else but going to school and working does not always allow me to spend that time working out (let alone those who have children.)  PT 24/7 workouts are a little over 30 minutes and get right to the point.  The only negative thing that I can say about the shortened time is that it does not emphasize the importance of stretching like Tony Horton does.  Some claim that this time is not long enough... and I tend to disagree.  I have a sports heart rate monitor and depending on your intensity you can burn anywhere from 300 to 500 calories in the short 30 minute period.  Another thing that I want to point out is how much the bands actually do with the unique was that you have them on.  When you take them off you feel like your arms are light as air.  And for people who don't like push-ups BEWARE.  There will be a lot of them in cardio and cardio burn.  Also, if you don't like counting (which if you have ever done a Billy Blanks video you know that's how he works,) I would not suggest these work-outs.  They are constantly counting.  This is not to say that PT 24/7 blows P90X out of the water by any means, just that after a few months of P90 this is a good alternative for those who do not have the time that P90 requires.  I am seeing great results!",1334793600,62,2628,4.233400402414487
4683539,2,B005FNLVHI,"I was sooo excited to try this program out! I was under the impression that it would be just like any other Tae Bo workout, only with the addition of the bands to give you a resistance workout at the same time. WRONG! Some of the workouts don't include even a single kick! Sometimes the workouts focus only on the bands, performing movements like you would if you were using free weights. The worst part is that in all 7 workouts, I never got that uniquely Tae Bo glute burn (which is what I was most looking forward to). The only upsides are that the workouts are only 30 minutes, and let you know when you are 50%, 75% and 85% done. I wish I could have just bought the bands to do with my original Tea Bo videos and skipped the PT24/7 videos all together! As far as the seller goes, I recieved my product quickly and everything was in perfect condition.",1333929600,7,855,4.251533742331288
4683540,1,B005FNLVHI,"I purchased and anxiously awaited my package to arrive. Once it did I was absolutely gob smacked.  The gloves are huge, I'm a small training glove and my hands swim around in the gloves so much so they can't be worn.  I contacted customer service and they advised they could refund but not actually supply a smaller glove.  As you can imagine highly disappointed the product went back in the box and it's sitting on the shelf.  I want to use the product but it was not sold as advertised and no where on the site does it mention that the gloves are a large size.  This product doesn't cater for small women's hands.  I believe this product isn't sold rightfully explaining the actual size of the gloves. I wish I could upload a picture to show you exactly how big these gloves are in comparison to my usual training gloves.  Very misleading!!",1333065600,18,842,4.4640522875816995

Amazing  workouts!! This set includes 7 DVDs and the cardio gloves and bands. Every workout is 30 minutes long. It's cardio and sculpting at the same time. All workouts are intense like an hour workout.
I realy like the body blast workout. It's the hardest one .
The only bad think is, that the gloves are not good hand made.
I use this workout kit many times and I realy see some changes.
I give this set five stars.",1332720000,,470,4.280898876404494

The tubing provides good resistance, but it causes bruising on my ankles.  The gloves are big and are hard on my hands.  I can definitely see the benefits of this program for someone who needs structure & guidance for working out.  I love the moves, but the repeated cuing can get old.  He does make eye contact with camera & motivates you as if he is tbere.  Overall I really enjoy the workout.  I didn't give it 5 stars bc if you're small like me the gloves can hurt your wrists and knuckles. Don't pay full price when you can find it for half!",1332633600,,655,4.0625

4683544,5,B005FNLVHI,I opted to attach the bands to my shoe laces. It's a really simple alternative and better than the Velcro in my opinion. Ripped Extreme is still my favorite single video as far as intensity but this 24/7 program provides a better overall fitness program AND delivers real results if you give 100% effort. I supplement with the Ripped Extreme and Ultimate from time-to-time to change things up but that's really not necessary to see results. For those of you that do not like to hear the background chatter I recommend utilizing the mute button and playing some of your own music. That's what I do once I learn the basics of the routines. I agree with some other reviews here that if you have small hands the gloves might feel a little large. I also agree that the Ripped Core video is awesome and probably among his best videos to date.,1332288000,8,836,4.506578947368421
4683545,5,B005FNLVHI,This is a great program and worth the money. A lot of thought went into it and it works. The workouts are hard but doable. The straps and bands work great.,1331251200,,155,4.032258064516129
4683546,3,B005FNLVHI,I been using this for three days and when I laugh my stomach hurts. I do feel the burn but when I put the gloves on I can't even see my pinky finger and it huts my hand in between the thumb and pointer. Also he didn't think about people that actually have boobs doing punches the band is kinda stopped by my boobs I guess you wouldn't notice in the video cuz thoses chicks are flat chested. Otherwise it's a good product so far I'll update since I haven't been using it that long,1330992000,4,479,4.052631578947368
4683567,4,B005FNLVHI,"I've done lots of these type of programs - p90x, turbofire, insanity, 10 minute trainer. This competes with the best of them - I love that the sessions are only around 30 minutes and give you a workout where you see results. In any program I've done, I have always loved the resistance band workouts the most - and I find my body really responds to the resistance. The entire program uses the bands. Once you figure out how to attach the bands and connect them to the gloves you're good to go - At first I started the dvd and paused it in order to figure it out.

Downsides - Shelly. The blonde girl to Billy's left (I believe she is his daughter from what I could find out.) She is super annoying and she will drive you crazy. Do your best to ignore her. The counting to 8 in everything is also annoying - a good music trac would have been better, but it is a series where you count to 8 over, and over, and...well you get the picture. Finally it bugs me that all the participants look angry and miserable - for some reason the constant intensity of their expressions just drives me nuts. Warm up and Cool down are not really a part of the video and also no chance to have water (and no participants on the video have water) is something I don't get. Take 10 seconds to get a drink. Workout moves are hard to follow at first and there is no one that does an alternative for beginners or for those that for one reason or another can't do a specific move.

Upside - Billy is good and the least annoying of anyone on the program. You will get results - use the bands - whatever reviewer said bands don't make a difference wasn't doing it correctly. The sessions go quick - I haven't found I get bored like I can with longer workouts. I also find I do the workouts because they are only 30 minutes.

All in all a good program. If he could delete Shelly the annoying blonde girl, I'd give it 5 stars.",1330473600,,1896,4.174863387978142
4683568,4,B005FNLVHI,"I love the workout. This is really good for boxing since the bands create resistance for both your feet and arms.

I kinda started slacking a lot around week 3. It's just not really addicting. Probably because I'm a guy who prefers using dumbbells for training.

Anyways, creates a lot of sweat and I feel good afterwards.

4683571,5,B005FNLVHI,"This is my 2nd week with 24/7 and its literally kicking my butt. However, in such a short time I am already feeling/seeing results. I have used taebo on and off for years. For me I got tired of having to workout 45 min or more and trying to squeeze in strength training as well. PT 24/7 does everything in a 33 min program. You workout 3 days on 1 day rest. With the resistent bands trust me when I say it feels like you are using weights the whole time.
Another plus you have 7 different discs so you will never get bored.
If you have never used taebo don't be intimidated. Billy starts you out with a basic program. For me even though I am in decent shape and familiar with the typical taebo moves I have no problem slowing it down a notch until I get use to the program. Its a great program and I would recommend it to anyone!

I don't do all the kicks right, or the foot work but I still get my heart rate up there. the only thing I don't like and the reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because of one of the girls in the DVD, I wish he would have switched people in each DVD or moved them around so it didn't seem you was watching the same  workout. The blond that is beside him in every workout is very distracting. She jumps and moves around when Billy is trying to tell you how to do the kicks and punches, she is very verbal shouting ""yes Sir"" when he looks in the camera talking. I sometimes have a hard time focusing on him for her jumping and shouting, and she is the only one that does it. several girls in the back row is just there doing the workout, I wish they would have put the blond in the back. as soon as the workout is over she is rushing to him patting his back and gets her own say in at the end, telling everyone to keep up the good work.

The gloves were also large and I had a hard time making a fist with the product at times. If you completed a workout like Insanity, this workout is cake and not very challenging. If you are a couch potatoe or are just a person that walks and not really into aerobics the workout may not be as effective. Don't get me wrong I use it in the morning before work because it's short and gets your heart rate up in 30 minutes, but I also do Insanity in the afternoon.

I also have a pair of weighted neoprene women's boxing gloves that I bought on Amazon and use those instead of the gloves that come with the PT 24/7 set as I found they were too big for me.
