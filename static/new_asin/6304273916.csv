7867789,5,6304273916,"This workout is outstanding.  I have been an avid tennis player for 30 years.  I used this
tape to get ""in shape"" for the tennis season, as I only played doubles in the winter time.
I have my favorites on there for sure.....but I have never tired of it.  I am still doing it
5 days a week, or on the days I am not playing tennis.  I am 66 years old.  I accredit that
the NAC system.

I wish there was another one out there.  I need that anaerobic intensity.

7867790,5,6304273916,"This tape is perfect for intermediate/advanced folk. Five National Aerobic Champions take turns guiding you through an aerobic routine that's based on ""intervals"" - moving from low-impact/medium pace routines to high impact very intense routines (that last about 2 minutes). Interval training is trendy right now because exercise gurus say it burns more fat than exercising at a consistent pace. There is a lot of hopping and jumping that will turn some people off, but two of the instructors stay low-impact (no jumping one foot on the floor) throughout the tape - so you don't have to go high-impact if you don't want to.

I'm not very coordinated, so it took me about 5 or 6 tries to get the harder moves. The hosts direct well, and are upbeat without being annoying. My single criticism - they don't incorporate much pre-exercise stretching. You'll want to do your own stretching, with emphasis on the legs, before starting. The post-routine stretching is adequate.",1134086400,2,969,5.0186335403726705
