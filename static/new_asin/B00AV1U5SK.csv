8558014,1,B00AV1U5SK,This video is both live action and animated. Don't misinterpret the casing as I did. I am a collector of christmas cartoons not live action christmas shows although this is mixed with both the animation is QUITE/QUITE slow. I do not like when a video casing shows a cartoon but once played theres live action or both. This deserves less than one star but at least it has some form of a cartoon at some points.,1426118400,,409,4.394736842105263
