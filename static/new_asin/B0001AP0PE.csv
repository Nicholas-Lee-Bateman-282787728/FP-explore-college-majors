1985513,4,B0001AP0PE,"This film illustrates how we all have cultified & built up these social structures of the economy, government, religion, cities, and become so thoroughly dependent on them, that if anything happens to these, we cannot function as humans anymore.

All these governing institutions we built up to take care of us, completely expecting these institutions would last forever.  As they grew, they became very dysfunctional, corrupt, and the humans become dehumanized, lemmings riding the subway, sitting in gridlocked cars.

As the governing institutions became poisonous and non-helpful to us, the humans cannot figure out what to do, so wander around in a stupor and denial, bargaining and making dehumanizing deals:  ""If I fire my loyal slave, sell Jesus-as-a-trinket, or sacrifice the girl, maybe it will keep disaster away or the gods happy a little bit longer""..

  We all have worked in situations where we or management sacrifices something or somebody to please the idiot boss, taxpayers or angry gods.

  This film also shows how we individually refuse to take responsiblity for the lack of humanity and bureaucracy we contribute to situations.",1107475200,2,1149,5.298342541436464
1985514,3,B0001AP0PE,"The cover caught my attention while surfing the web for foreign movies and then I ran into it at the video store the next day.

I will be the first to admit that I enjoy the content/story of a movie first, followed by the photography, sound and interpretations.

Although I was intrigued by the overweight character and a few of the comical situations - his appearance while smudged with soot, the scenes with the crucifixes and his repetition of ""He wrote poetry until he went nuts"", while describing his son in the mental institution, it was not until I sat through the Director's Comments after viewing the movie that I understood many of the scenes. Much of it had to do with the economic and social history of Sweden. Since I know next to nothing about such, I did not understand the movie while watching it. Now that I understand much of the symbolism I would describe it as marginally interesting.",1106006400,3,904,4.608695652173913
1985515,4,B0001AP0PE,"This film combines the pacing of Eraserhead, the mood of Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"", the stark beauty of Edward Hopper's paintings & the humor of Rita Rudner on her darkest day. Each scene is fresh and daring so that despite the slow pace, you rarely get bored. The camera work is deliberately NON action-oriented. Hence, the camera (almost) never pans, fades, etc; it simply records. Depth and texture are composed in each shot as if the cinematographer is painting a picture (in fact, most opening shots in each scene are worthy of framing). The humor is fiercely dark, but only the most concrete will call it inappropriate. Each tragic (and often simultaneously hilarious) scene smacks you across the face while tickling something inside . . . the priest who chews away at dinner and recoils from his parishioner's angst, then narcissisitically makes the encounter all about himself; the guy rummaging through the trash who inadvertently stirs up more life than he bargained for; the son gone mad because he wrote too much poetry along with his father who is repeatedly dragged from the psychiatric institute for uncontrollably screaming at his ""crazy"" kid; a field of dead people resurrected and in retreat from an angry, failed salesman of crucifixes.) If you know for certain that you are only satisfied by action-oriented, Hollywood blockbusters, this is not the right film for you. If, however, you like to occasionally push the envelope and take a walk on the psychologically wilder side, this film (despite the few scenes that don't work) is worth a look. But remember, the pacing is VERY different than mainstream films, so get in the right frame of mind before you push PLAY.",1105833600,2,1688,4.968197879858657
1985516,4,B0001AP0PE,"Leaping one scene to another, each shot with one long continuous take (and the camera that does not move), 'Songs from the Second Floor' is like no other films you've ever seen.  Well, some might remember Jacques Tati; some Samuel Becket.  You may call it comedy, sure.  But this Swedish film is so quirky that the only way for you to realize its worth is to watch it.  And on DVD, at 3 am. alone.

It's not the story that counts; but the atmosphere of one unnamed city where people are anticipating the end of the country, or possibly the world itself.  A total confusion of the dismal society is represented by the gray city and its ever-clouded sky, where no sunshine can be seen.  The traffic is heavily conjested by the cars heading for somewhere else, but they cannot move at all.  And as if to show the lost souls, the most of the characters are wearing white make-ups.

And ... those characters, who behave so absurdly.  They do not move or talk fast; slowly, very slowly, however, the film shows the ridiculous side of their actions.  One visits his mentally-ill son in hospital, where he is taken away by the guards instead.  Another is followed by a ghost in a cafe.  And my favorite is the world's most wretched magic on stage.

But though I find these scenes funny, I know not all would share my feelings.  The film's characters are often 'deadpan'; some scenes look drawn-out beyond limits; and as the film does not use the traditional linear storytelling, you might find it too boring even after laughing out loud five minutes before.  And all the actors are non-professionals (literally 'found' in such places as street or shopping center), and it clearly shows.

If you want to see a very unique film, which is quite open for interpretations, see this one.  The only way to express its strange (acquired) taste is to use this word 'quirky.'  'Songs from the Second Floor' -- and what a quirky title! -- is deliciously so, probably requires our repeated viewings.  As to its visual (with no costly CGIs), it is worth of it.

By the way, the film is inspired by a poem 'Tranpie Entre Dos Estrellas' by Peruvian poet Cesar Vallejo.  The music is composed by Benny Andersson, the keyboard player of one pop group ABBA.",1105315200,2,2231,4.58080808080808
1985517,5,B0001AP0PE,Beutifull cinematography. Each scene could be a potography in a gallery. The pace and absurdity of the events render this film a poetic comedy/tragedy. The visula style and stationary camera highlights the irony and ridicule in modern life. The reviews here fail to emphasize how funny the sureal scenes are.,1103932800,3,308,5.18
1985518,5,B0001AP0PE,"Songs From the Second Floor is the best film I've seen in a long time.  The movie is unconventional in that it has no plot and is filled with a number of events that don't always follow one another.

I think the primary focus of the film however is on the man whose picture appears on the box cover.  In the beginning of the film he burns down his furnature store in order to collect insurance money.  He also has a son who drove himself crazy writing poetry.  After he burned down his business, he trys to make a living selling crucifixes.

Along our journey in this film we see a number of people who are either in great dispair, suffering or are on the verge of a mental collapse.  Along our journey in life, we experience pretty much what is shown in this film.  I love this film because it vividly shows what life is like but at the same time it's very dream-like.  What is life but one mishap or mistake after another?

The film is also very funny.  The part in particular which made me laugh was when there was a scene when a man had just been apparently fired from his job then he clings on to his bosses leg like a kid repeating the same thing over and over again.",1102809600,7,1173,4.168888888888889
1985519,5,B0001AP0PE,"What is this film about ? It is about strange things happening in a strange city ? What is this absurd traffic that cars are stuck in for days, without moving even for a few feet ? Where is everybody going ? What went wront with the magicians act and almost killed the volunteer from the audience ?

In short what is Anderson trying to say ? A lot. And it is all an alegory about the human life. Trapped in convention, in relations, like being stuck in the traffic, working hard and as the hero says ""try to put some food on the table, and enjoy oneself"". It is also a criticism of the establishment and power. When people trust their lives in authority that is supposed to take care of them, like trusting that the magician will not cut you in half but will make the trick work, but things go wrong.  Like when a mental patient is wearing the doctor's robe and nobody understands the difference.

The imagery of the film is stunning to say the least, the photography, the colors, the camera that never moves, the ever lasting deep focus that captures foreground and background and does not miss anything. Oh, this is a masterpiece. It reminded me of Tarkofski, although lighter and more approachable, and also Angelopoulos, although not so slow.

I would recomend this film to everyone. And if you are puzzled at the end about what it all means you will get a lot of answers on the special features section where you can see the entire film from the beginning with the director explaining his concept and answering questins about the technical aspects of the film and about its message.

One of the best films of the past 10 years I would say.",1093046400,29,1644,4.4485049833887045
1985520,2,B0001AP0PE,"If it was the filmakers intention to bore the viewer to tears, then he made a fantastic film. I like avant garde filmaking and never cared for hollywood wiz bang blockbusters but this film was so painfully boring it made me cry.  Did the filmaker succeed in his goal for the film? In my opinion yes.",1092960000,,299,4.339285714285714
1985521,5,B0001AP0PE,"I first saw this film IIRC in 2001 at the Roger Ebert Overlooked Film Festival (""Ebertfest"") in Champaign-Urbana.  I instantly fell in love with the film -- it was clearly the best film at the festival.  And then I waited for DVD release... and waited... and waited.  Finally I received my copy, some 4+ years after the film was released.
Upon watching it again, I felt it lost something compared to the presentation on the massive screen and enthusiastic 800+ audience at the Virginia Theatre.  The visuals are intentionally drab, but incredibly rich and detailed; hence, the small screen is not kind.  Also, like much absurdist art, it is difficult to recapture the emotional shock and wonderment of the first viewing.  But yet the movie is still compelling on DVD.
This Swedish comedy is dark, brooding, irreverent and often times disturbing.  From the grey skies to the traffic-jammed streets to the predominantly obese and ashen-faced cast, this movie makes no attempt to be be pretty or cheery.  However, certain scenes of despair are so full of beauty, one smiles despite oneself.  I am reminded of certain scenes from the work of Terry Gilliam.
The plot is rather simple: things are not going well in this fictional Scandinavian city and the citizens are getting desperate.  Don't ask why or where -- it's truly unimportant.  Woven into this fabric is Caesar Vallejo's poem ""Beloved be the man who sits down,"" the verses of which form a a type of modern beatitudes extolling the merits of the mundane individual.  In the movie, the poem is written by the protaganist's son, who now resides in a mental hospital.  Ironically, the people in the patients in the mental hospital appear to be the only sane residents in a city gone loopy as capitalism, government and religion fail its increasingly desperate and selfish citizens.
A great film to see, but really not for everyone.",1081728000,14,1883,4.883647798742138
1985522,5,B0001AP0PE,"Songs from the Second Floor is visually stunning as it esthetically illustrates a cynical view of the human existence.  This view consists of a kaleidoscope of scenes that personify desire, fear, guilt, and anxiety among other human traits.  These human characteristics are symbolically tied up with the everlasting traffic jam that is depicted in the film as the characters are constantly unavailable for each other as they are trying to get somewhere better.  This search could be a quest for happiness; however, the search itself might be the cause of the gloomy state of the characters.  Songs from the Second Floor is based on a poem by Caesar Vallejo, and Andersson extracts the darkness of the verse as he brings a brilliant cinematic experience to the silver screen, which will cerebrally agonize the audience in a poetic and artistic manner.",1080691200,5,850,5.05
1985523,5,B0001AP0PE,"Embedded somewhere in Andersson's mind-boggling, deadpan ""Songs"" is a satire aimed at religion, politics, careerism, and the terrifying emptiness of office life. Imagine an Ingmar Bergman film directed by David Lynch and you have some inkling of just how surreal this exercise in gloomy comic absurdity gets. Swedish director Andersson might be giving us a glimpse of society's end, especially with his haunting final shot, but his razor-sharp sense of humor make these Nordic ""Songs"" more than a one-note adventure in Kafkaesque futility.",1185321600,,539,5.506024096385542
1985524,5,B0001AP0PE,"I remember seeing a preview of this film on Ebert and Roeper's show, and the clip they showed was so mesmerzing and unique (it reminded me of Fellini) that I kept an eye out for it (for the record, Roger and Richard recommended the film highly).  It finally appeared about six months later, and I went with great enthusiasm.  The film exceeded my expectations expotentially.  The audience for the film looked a little bit conservative at first, but after the film started, they were rolling in the aisles and no one left.  This is a truly amazing piece of work.

It's alternately sad, funny, sacreligious, and beautiful.  It's filmed in brilliantly choreographed long takes (where the camera is usually stationary, but the detail of the framing is immaculate).  Many have called this a cross between Ingmar Bergman and Monty Python.  I would toss in a little Luis Bunuel, and that's an approximation of this film.  It's a very dark film, but it's also darkly hilarious, and every scene is so incredibly well done that the whole film burns into your brain.  The director, Roy Andersson, has only made a handful of feature films, but he is extremely well known in the advertising world for his hilarious commercials (which are done in the style in this film).  There are so many great scenes, but my favorite scenes have to be the scenes with Christ (especially when a Jesus figure is swinging from the cross...it's hysterical and so incredibly sacreligious).  The church is the main target of a lot of the satire here, but the film goes further than just ""the church is greedy and corrupt"" message that permeates many films today.  Politicians and humanity in general are other notable targets.  This is a great film, one of the most unique that I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a lot of films).",1173484800,2,1797,4.736334405144695

1985526,5,B0001AP0PE,"Let me begin by saying this is one of the most striking films I have managed to catch in a while and that, for that reason alone, film buffs will not want to miss it. It has an attention to detail that is rarely found, and makes repeated viewings worthwhile  However, even for those who are not necessarily interested in ""artsy"" films, there are still good reasons to see this film.

One reviewer below notes that, having listened to the director's commentary about the symbolic meaning of much of what is going on in the film, that this reduces it to being ""marginally interesting"".  There's a great deal of truth in this, and makes for an excellent reason not to listen to the director's commentary, especially as a creator's intentions may not always provide the best insight into a work. Sometimes a work can be greater, or the effect can be meaningful in ways that a director or writer may not realize. For example, there are a number of images in the film about the indifferent powers-that-be, who are so heartless at one point as to actually sacrifice a girl in a superstitious ritual to try to save their failing world; in another, at a business meeting, a gypsy fortune-teller passes around a crystal ball.  To reduce this to merely a commentary on specific current Swedish social policies threatens to remove the relevance of the image for all of us in industrialized nations.

Whatever the case of this, the primary reason to see this movie is for its very striking images, and the specific content of each scene. In each (with one exception), the camera never moves; there are no cuts (except between scenes), no shifts of perspective. One watches each scene from a single point of view always. This is hardly noticeable at first, if at all, because the action very much ""fills the frame"" set by the motionless camera. Moreover, because the camera does not move, the director sets up each shot so there is tremendous depth to it, going far into the distance. He utilizes this depth brilliantly, and this helps to keep the film ""moving"".

For example, at one point a father and son are visiting another son in a mental hospital. The ""crazy"" poet-son sits in the extreme foreground; his brother mulls on the right nearby, and the father is behind them both, delivering a monologue. On the left, stands a psychologist in a white doctor's coat with a clipboard, looking uncertain and confused. The setting is a long, long hallway, with two archways, painted in white and a faint shade of beige or yellow (I'm trying to remember the color from memory). As the father's monologue continues, from the very end of the hallway, a man in a dark blue shirt walks up with two more orderlies. Paying no attention to the father or his son, the man in the blue shirt says to the doctor, ""What did I tell you about my lab coat? Give it back,"" or something like that. Suddenly, you realize that the ""doctor"" is actually a mental patient. He resists, and the orderlies must wrestle the coat off of him, then walk off with the man in the blue shirt.

This is what reviewers mean by quirky (I assume), this sudden shift of expectations--from ""doctor"" to ""crazy person"". Of course, this serves as a commentary on the state of psychiatric medicine as well, but that's much less obvious than the startling humor of the scene. At the same time, the father's monologue is becoming a rant (he ultimately is ushered away by orderlies as well--more ""symbolism"" that ""normal"" is ""crazy"" and the ""crazy"" son must be normal, if one wants to read it that way), so that the emotional effect of the father's rant is colored by, overshadowed by, modified by the startling humor of the blue-shirted man's interaction with the hospital patient.  It makes for a very heady brew of images and effects--and this level of surprise is maintained throughout the entire film, from the opening scene to the last.

This film was apparently very expensive to make--and this shows in the pain-staking level of detail, and that everything was built--computer graphics were not relied upon, there were many, many takes of scenes. This detail, however, is not limited only to the visuals of the film. The details continue down to the very words spoken. As such, it is unfair to describe this film as ""random"" or having no plot

I can think of three ways one might view the plot of this film. First, as the symbolic story that is being told by the director about the state of Swedish affairs--this involves diatribes against those in power, mindless (zombie-like) hordes of business people, practicing superstitious gestures (like flagellation, child sacrifice, divination) to save their failing world, broadsides on education, and most of all the justifications by those in power for what they have done.  The whole movie threads together along this otherwise ""invisible"" subtext.  Of course, there is no need to watch the film this way. The beautiful surrealism and ambiguous implications of Anderson's crystal-clear imagery alone suggests that turning the thing into this kind of literal allegory is, indeed, only marginally interesting.

A second way to watch the film is at ""face-value,"" as almost a kind of political zombie movie.  The movie's second scene shows a long-time employee being fired in an exceptionally Kafkaesque way. This is followed by a foreigner being beaten up by hostile natives. What I gather from this is that ""something is wrong with the world."" Thus, the main character enters, on a subway, covered in soot, as all of the other passengers open their mouths, and chorale music pours out.  Gradually, we learn that the man has burned down his shop for the insurance money and it seems clear enough that this is a response to the disintegration of the world around him. And so on.  What particularly makes this into a ""plot"" that one can follow, is that it all seems related to his alternating sense of guilt (that he and others like him have made the world into the crazy place it has become) and trying to justify himself, especially to his son the poet, who has also gone ""crazy"".

And the last way to watch the film is simply for the vignettes presented in each scene--their visual sumptuousness and detail.  This might ultimately seem to make the whole movie disjointed or fragmented, but even that could be said to be a commentary on modern life. Regardless, each scene is a multi-faceted and sparkling gem itself, so that it is not even necessary to string all these gems together into a necklace.

However one views the film, it may be something of a shame that the oddness or quirkiness of the film might be off-putting enough to some to not stick with it for the duration.  In its small way, the motionless camera actually helps, since one does not become distracted by shifts and cuts; the motionless camera draws attention to the motion of things in the film, which one's focus can alight upon. In any case, for those willing to expend some patience on this very striking film, the rewards are entirely there to be reaped.",1163462400,8,7021,4.748768472906404
1985527,5,B0001AP0PE,"This film is about as complex and clinically cut as its creator, the not-easy-to-read Swedish filmmaker Roy Andersson.

  It's a long series of still tableaus, combinging the solitude and desolation of Edward Hopper with a sneery touch of absurdsim as can be found in the best works of Lynch, Brothers Quay, Beckett, the French slaptick of Jacques Tati and Kafka.

We witness, very often form a distance, strange happenings, sometimes apparently without a point, sometimes plain dull, but at many other times both hilarious and intruiging. The overall tone is howver deadpan, and how strange or weird the occurences, the people who undergo these happenings or witnissing it from the side, almost seem indifferent about it. Like the things we get to see in this movie when we run if for the first time, have happened to the movie inhabitants every other day.

Static camerashots, much use of enstranged totallities rather than intimate close ups, morbid themes within lives of mostly uninteresting people, and some hit-in-your-face sublayers in which something more than the depicted 'ordinary daily life' is suggested, make for a unique movie experience. And with this Andersson puts his ""Songs from the second floor"" right in between Tarkovski's ""Mirror"" and and some moments the higly metaphorical ""Stalker"" and other classics of vision cinema like Alain Resnais' ""Last year at Marienbad"" and even, although I say this with some reserves, E. Elias Merhige' metaphysical splatter spectacle ""Begotten"".

And all of a sudden I am reminded by Jim Jarmusch' ""Stranger than paradise""; also filmed in static one-shot-sc?nes, also deadpan and without close imagery, and yet still a portrair of a society that remains in your mind, long after the closing credits have finished. But where Jarmusch' picture is a slice-of-life in a all too realistic but still intimate world of just-living-in-the present-youth in the 80's run down America, ""Songs from the second floor"", with all it's religious symbolism, suggests more of a coming armageddon, a social Apocalypse with a stunning final shot of zombie-like creatures walking slowly towards a huge pile of aboandonned crucifixes.

 ""Songs..."" to put it in final terms, is a different movie in every aspect, but still of highly enjoyable but ever so dark entertainment.",1146096000,2,2308,5.252717391304348
1985528,5,B0001AP0PE,This film is captivating in it's imagery.  There are quite a few scenes that will always be burned into my brain.  This director is very bleak and unsettling but also funny and horrifying.  I'm not quite sure what was happening in some of the scenes but they hit nerves that we can all identify with.  It's worth seeing if you want to see some avant garde European cinema.  I enjoyed it a lot for what it was.  It has it's own voice and it's worth seeing.,1143417600,,455,4.232558139534884
1985529,5,B0001AP0PE,"After several years of silence when it comes to cinematic film products Swedish directors Roy Anderson returned with Songs from the second floor the year 2000. Since 1970 when Roy directed his first cinematic film A Love Story (En krlekshistoria) he has produced three more movies which along with the first have received plenty of international prizes. The absence of directed cinematic films can partly be traced to his work with commercial films for major Swedish and international companies, but also to his originality and perfectionism that prevents him from making movies in a short time. The making and the cinematic content of Songs from the second floor is a good example that these two characteristics is one of Roy's two most important trademarks. The story of the film evolves partly around the head character Kalle who's firm has being burned downed to the ground. Along with him and his daily life problems, which includes his thoughts about making a living for the future and his son who has become nuts by writing poems, the viewer also gets to follow different person's lives in social situations; a magician number on stage where a man accidentally is being cut in the stomach by a saw and the result of this in the man's quiet and grey every day life, a man who's being fired from work after being an employer in 30 years, the immigrant who's searching for a man called Sven and only receives suspiciousness and violence when he's being beat up on the street. The movie does not contain a classic dramatic structure as we can find in many other movies in terms of presentation, background, conflict, development and end. Even though we get a presentation of the characters, especially Kalle, and this leads to some kind of conflict in terms of human relations in their social life the movie has tiny resemblances to the classic movie structure. Every scene has its own independence and symbolical content at the same time as it gives an important part to the movie as a whole. But instead of developing this conflicts into another height which eventually would lead to an happy ending Roy keeps presenting an ongoing conflict in terms of symbols and unpredictable scenery and events and suddenly the ending is coming up never really letting the viewer understand how he got there in the first place.

One thing that captured my mind immediately when I first saw the movie was that the camera never moves, either vertical or horizontal, and it's always showed through the same camera angle. The tempo of the movie becomes in this way very slow. Even though many great film directors uses the ability of the camera to capture the audience's attention in form of moving perspectives this is not anything that is necessary in this movie, and the still camera is actually in my opinion one of the primary reasons that makes this movie so interesting and original in the end also a masterpiece. The non-moving camera makes each scene feels like an interesting piece of art that might as well could have been a painting if not the characters were moving and had a conversation. As a fan of Stanley Kubrick you can notice that Roy Andersson has him as a big influence (especially 2001: A Space Odyssey). If you're a fan of Kubrick's movie, Monthy Python and experimental movie in general I truly recommend this original masterpiece.",1141344000,2,3344,4.815652173913043
1985530,4,B0001AP0PE,"Roy Andersson's Songs from the Second Floor mixes equal parts George Romero (esp. Night of the Living Dead), Samuel Beckett (esp. Endgame), Jean-Luc Godard (esp. Weekend), and very likely a few other cinematic allusions I didn't catch, resulting in this bizarre apocalyptic black humorous take on life as we know it.

A failed businessman torches his furniture store to collect the insurance money, then uses that money to invest in another business that fails. A young man writes poetry praising people who sit. A young girl is done away with in a sacrificial rite presided over by church officials. An enormous traffic jam blocks progress throughout an entire city. A dead man walks around seeking silent retribution. A business partner throws large crucifixes on a pyre. These are some of the more potent images that surface in this non-linear film that simultaneously fills the viewer with despair and absurdist merriment. What can we do? We're only human.

A voluptuous young woman having sex with a virile man stops to hear her name called out on the street. A homeless man rummages through street trash, immediately following which a passel of strange animals flees from the pile.

If this sounds like there's no plot, that's true. There really isn't. We follow, to some extent, the misadventures of Karl, the businessman, a large despairing man who bemoans his fate, finding himself in situations that may, from one perspective, test the viewer's patience, but when seen overall are ludicrous and at the same time oddly compelling and relentless. In an interesting set of extras, the director comments that he definitely did not want to make a Hollywood film in which a happy ending predominates, and that is certainly the case here. The entire film is a brilliant contemporary parable whose fitting ending is a perfect summation of both the entire film and the filmmaker's view of society.

The meaning of the title appears to be an ironic homage to religion--""second floor"" referring to the view from above the street, that is, day-to-day life--or to the perspective of a creative artist who as well observes our behavior from an outside perspective and then offers his commentary on it. Religion itself is savagely skewered in this film, so this seems an appropriate interpretation.

Regardless, this is an excellent piece of filmmaking that is unique, strange, blackly humorous, bizarre, peculiar, and strongly resonant.

Definitely recommended.",1117584000,4,2457,5.145363408521304

Also, the actors and actresses for the most part are old and their faces look pale (make up that makes them look like dead corpses or zombies).

In conclusion, this is an artistic film with deep message(s) that left an everlasting impression on me...",1437523200,,790,5.181102362204724

You will feel you have traveled and that you have been in another space-time...and oddly refreshed. I just love this move. But I DO have a penchant for Nordic quirky flicks! (See La Vie des Bohemmes; The Man Without a Past; Lars von Trier...which I am trying to add without raising the likelihood that I am a self-involved arthouse twit....I don't THINK I am...)",1421366400,,562,4.686868686868687
8009453,5,B0001AP0PE,"What a strange movie. I bought it after watching a documentary series ""history of cinema"". The reviews I saw did not do it justice as it is a slow moving and abstract art film. The documentary pointed out the use of deep visual focus that I would have missed if it had not been identified as part of the directors technique throughout the film. It is a film you need to watch more than once as there is a myriad of personal interrelationships.",1417651200,,443,4.349397590361446
8009454,5,B0001AP0PE,"This is not an easy film to watch, and there are no happy endings. However, if you think of film as an art form, rather than as empty entertainment, then this is a film you should watch. Roy Andersson's cinematography is beautiful and very controlled, often recreating or referencing well-known paintings and photographs. The underlying message is very critical of contemporary social and economic arrangements, and also takes a few digs at Sweden's role in WW II. Andersson's approach, characterized by still cameras, suffused colors, and extremely carefully composed scenes is not aimed to please the masses, but actually gets better with each viewing. This IS a comedy, but a dark, satirical comedy, and most of the jokes are visual and symbolic. Andersson wants to make you uncomfortable, and chances are he will succeed.",1360713600,,825,5.164179104477612
8009455,5,B0001AP0PE,"Speedy service, received in a day or so. One of the best movies these eyes have seen. Movie has very little dialogue but it doesn't need it, touches on life changing thoughts.",1337990400,,175,4.5
8009456,5,B0001AP0PE,"This (poem) film is a series 46 pieces which beautifully express everything from a satire on capitalist greed to a honest examination of the human condition, love, religion and everything we want and don't want in life.

As you watch the film, by the end, all of the seemingly out of place pieces will fall back together. This is a true masterwork. One of the greatest films of all time. It all makes sense in the end.

I ordered this DVD on amazon and the first time I watched the film I saw it one way. I waited a couple of months and re-watched Songs From The Second Floor and I saw it in a whole other light.

Roy Andersson created a never before seen world. He is a master artist. I can examine each scene, or try to sum it up like Monty Python meets Ingmar Bergman and etc., but each person will take something different out of this MASTERWORK.",1302652800,,850,4.267080745341615
8009457,5,B0001AP0PE,"Unique, funny, brave look at capitalist bureaucracy slowly destroying Swedish society, told through a series of beautifully photographed absurd and surreal vignettes. (Organized religion takes some lumps as well).

The camera never moves, and each scene is a story told in a single wondrously composed and art-directed shot. Some pieces are more powerful than others, some funny, some tragic. But this is bold, adventurous filmmaking. Even it's failed moments are more interesting than most modern 'successes'.

It's fascinating to see how much Andersson's style changed since his great first success 'A Swedish Love Story' 30 years earlier. That film was a subtle, naturalistic, wonderful look at young love. Here he creates what one critic aptly labeled 'Monty Python meets Ingmar Bergman'. I'd throw in ex-Monty Python Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' as well. If that sounds at all interesting to you, check this out, as well as Andersson's equally terrific follow up, 'We, The Living'.

(Note, the pace is very slow by modern cinema standards. but I found myself pulled into it, the way one is by good poetry).

This seems to go in and out of print (as do so many great movies), so I advise you to grab it while you have the chance.",1290556800,,1229,5.009803921568627
8009458,5,B0001AP0PE,"About halfway through watching this Swedish gem, something inside me thought, ""Wow. You will absolutely never see anything else like this."" Songs from the Second Floor is an abstract meditation on the human condition that's loosely based on a poem by Peruvian poet Csar Vallejo. This is a very quiet, unadorned film: the camera moves in a scene only once in the entire movie, and the scenes themselves are set in the most mundane of places: sidewalks, apartment bedrooms, train stations, bars. But these ordinary surroundings are punctuated with borderline absurd occurrences: A passerby gets stabbed for speaking with the wrong accent. A salesman sells oversized Crucifix statues but decides that's not where the real money is. Self-flagellating stock brokers move like a herd through the streets while an economist looks for answers in a crystal ball about the problem of work getting too expensive. Some of these strange vignettes work better than others, but all of them ring with a striking sadness about moving forward through life without all the proper pieces in place. It's hard to describe this movie accurately and without making it sound ridiculous, but afterward I felt like I'd seen something truly singular and special - and, despite the stark sadness of the themes, I still felt optimistic at the movie's end. Watch it with a glass of wine and an open mind.",1264464000,,1373,5.026315789473684

These are the words of a homeless man searching through a garbage pile who offers some of the bread he has found to a stranger. Meanwhile paranoid Kalle desperately tries to improve his livelihood...to ""put food on the table, enjoy himself""; poets go mad; and tradesmen cannot sell the crucified Jesus. Government officials base their decisions on a gypsy fortuneteller and sacrifice a child to appease ""the fate."" Sounds absurd so far? There is more. People are stuck in a perpetual traffic jam with thousands dragging themselves on the streets. At first I thought they were flogging themselves, but actually they are whipping the backs of the people in front of them. And all this on a gray industrial background. The saddest thing is none of it looked absurd, but rather familiar. Try to get hold of this movie if you can.",1252108800,2,957,4.877300613496932
