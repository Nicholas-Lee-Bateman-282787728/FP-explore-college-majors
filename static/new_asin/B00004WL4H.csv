1365856,4,B00004WL4H,"Compared to power yoga routines I'm used to, these are shorter and easier workouts, but not necessarily worse. More time is spent on the ground, though I didn't really feel the ab emphasis that I expected. In fact, I found both programs more relaxing than strenuous. I prefer the second program, finding it somewhat more challenging. In the first session, Al talks more than Jennifer does in the second, which distracts from the postures for me. Maybe it's just me, but tabletop pose was hard on my shoulders.",1183852800,,509,4.795454545454546
1365857,3,B00004WL4H,"Yoga Zone tends to use 2 people, one to demonstrate, one to teach, done outside with very light, old style piano music.
There are two 20 min workouts. This is paced very slow with every pose lasting 1-2 min. each. The poses used are child's pose, plank, warrior 1 & 2, boat (3 diff levels of difficulty), bridge, plank, an easy dolphin, table, cobra, upward facing dog, butterfly, seated spinal twist, 2 hip stretches, 1 legged standing, simple torso side stretching & maybe 1 or 2 others & that's it. The only unusual thing is laying back on your elbows & holding a leg up slightly off the ground for an ab workout.
You get a better ab workout on the first workout if anything. The slow pace kills it. It would be better if they also had a workout that was the same, but faster paced w/only a few cues.
There's no meditation, yoga zone's style is more about alignment & exercise, nothing spiritual.
If you like slow pace, lotsa detail since the one talking isn't doing much work, this is for you.",1159660800,,997,4.423913043478261
1365858,5,B00004WL4H,"Yoga Zone: Yoga for Abs

Like 'Total Body Conditioning' this 40 minute program consists of two separate, 20 minute pieces. Al Bingham leads the first section, and Jennifer Moness models the sequences. Al's section focuses on the body's core, and he challenges his audience to see it as a seat of power. His method stems from traditional Indian metaphysical theories, of a life force (prana) circulating between the 6 chakras, which are the main energy centers of the body. They operate along a central channel from the top of the head to the tail bone.

Keeping the audience's secular interests in mind, Al simply guides the viewers to examine their spinal alignment. His checklist includes three points, the solar plexus, the naval, and the pelvic bone. In the mystical sense, these areas correspond with 3 of the 6 traditional seats of power, but they are also logical focal points to work with, when looking to improve our upright posture.

Like the earlier ''Total Body Conditioning'' this is not an abs-workout that guides sets of crunches or push-ups. The resistance is psychological, as it is an internal exercise which enables the viewer to see and feel the interaction between his abdominal muscles and his lower spine. The moderator asserts the importance of maintaining a strong bodily core, in relationship to a powerful yet serene state of mind.

The postures (that also reappear in later segments in the series) are varied but not strenuous. He alternates between repetition and stasis: The lone palm tree, for example, asks you to see your body in terms of a series of lines, which is an excellent guideline for Yoga, in general. He and Jennifer move seamlessly between side and vertical stretches, and forward bends. They hold several static postures which lean frontward, which are exercises in maintaining balance. This upholding of these positions requires stability in the body's core, and its application is a corrective tactic with the needs of their audience in mind. It compensates for the degenerative effects that our current lifestyle has on our spinal column. It returns equilibrium to the bodies and minds that so often are stooped over, be it in front of a steering wheel, a computer screen, or a kitchen counter.

The program also incorporates some balancing and resistance routines that build strength in the abs. They do a plank pose, and later, they reverse it, supporting the body on its heels. Toward the end of the series, he explicitly walks you through sitting abdominal-spinal twists that aid in flexibility, and he throws in a couple of reps of the dynamic bridge. Finally, in a cross-legged pose, they encourage sitting tall, yet relaxed.

Jennifer Moness leads the next segment, accompanied by Jean Turner. Like all of the twenty minute pieces of this trio, her program can either operate as a continuation of the earlier, or stand on its own. Her goals build on what has been established, broadening the focus on how to build strength and flexibility in the midsection, and why. Her addition demonstrates the correlation between the abdominals and the lower back.

She starts in a seated position, tadasana, where they left off in the last video, reminding the viewer to maintain a ''long spine.'' She flows into the table-top position, and following with a couple of reps of the (dynamic) thunderbolt position, and a series of forward bends. Consistent with all of the previous programs, she emphasizes the physiological importance of doing movements and postures correctly, while conveying that less is more.

She guides a series that enables stretching, and the release of tension in the lower back. The program includes a dynamic contrast between plank pose, and cobra pose that accomplish that goal. Several movements follow Al's earlier lead, that alternate between stretching forward (and backward,) balancing, and reaching tall. She winds down by returning to the cobra posture, and the extending and lengthening forward of the dynamic cat, which reverses and complements the stretch in the spine.",1122768000,,4049,5.087349397590361
1365859,5,B00004WL4H,"The two programs on this DVD/VHS are short but complete whole body routines. They focus on the Abdominal area and how it relates to various postures, so you have a real ""awareness"" of how your mid-section is engaged in postures not typically thought of as related to the Abdominal region. But more than that, they are well rounded yoga sessions that anyone at any level or age can truly benefit from.

I have been doing yoga daily for over 8 years and while I tend to like a more vigorous vinyasa style practice, there are many times that I need to back off a bit but still want an effective routine. This, along with any of the programs in the Yoga Zone Basics set, is a wonderful alternative.

For someone newer to yoga, this program can be an excellent starting point. While you are not doing many poses that are ""Ab Specific"" (there are no crunches, situps, leg raises) you will definitely feel your Abs in a way that is real life practical. What I mean is, in your daily life you can use this awareness to help you support your torso whether you are walking, sitting or just standing.

I bought the Yoga Zone Basics set for my 60 something year old mother and she really loves this Abs program in particular. It is thorough enough without being overwhelming for her and it's very easy to fit in each day at only 20 minutes per routine.

If you are looking for a more intense Ab program, I'd highly recommend Baron Baptistes ""Core Power"" program which is Vinyasa/flow based, works the body as a whole in addition to very specific abdominal exercises and is under 30 minutes long.

Also Bryan Kest has a ""6 minute Abs"" tape with two short Ab routines. I like to use one of the routines from this program usually after doing another short Yoga program such as ""AM yoga for beginners"" by Rodney Yee, ""Stress Relief Yoga For Beginners"" by Suzanne Deason, ""Power Yoga Stamina For Beginners"" by Rodney Yee or any of the Yoga Zone Basics routines.

The routines on the Kest Program are closer to 15 minutes each but start with Sun Salutations (only a couple though which for me isn't quite enough warmup, hence my need for doing something before it) so that perhaps the actual Ab focus is around 6 minutes, but they are a grueling 6 minutes :))

1365860,5,B00004WL4H,This DVD is a must for anybody just getting into yoga. Yoga Zone videos are always very easy to understand and follow and the instructors are awesome. I have RA and am sometimes limited physicaly but I can do Yoga Zone anytime.,1110844800,,227,4.428571428571429
1365861,3,B00004WL4H,"This DVD is a nice place to start for those who have no experience with yoga and have not been working out regularly.  If you are a fairly consistent exerciser who works your abs frequently, this DVD will be too easy for you.  Same goes for those at the intermediate yoga level.  This DVD will only appeal to yoga novices and people, like me, who are pretty out of shape.  For the pros and cons:
Pros:
1)  The outdoor setting is very relaxing.  It's a nice change of pace from those bright, fluorescent studios.
2)  The instructors, Al and Jen, are friendly and motivational without being overly perky and annoying.
3)  Both 20-minute segments provide a nice stretch and gently work your abs.  This video is not difficult, so don't shy away if you're just starting yoga or working out again.  Some of the poses, like the plank, are more difficult, but they are not held long enough to kill you.
Cons:
1)  As the Amazon editorial reviewer says, this DVD will not give you rock hard abs. You will need to find something else if that's your goal.
2)  Even for beginners, this will soon become very easy.  Though it could provide a nice stretch/warm-up/cool-down for other routines.
3)  In the first workout, Al spends a little too much time on instruction which will get annoying after the first few times.  I tend to do Jen's segment because she talks less.
A final note:  while the instructors encourage you to connect your mind and body and remind you of proper breathing, you don't get much meditation here or Eastern philosophy.  This could be a plus or minus depending on what you're looking for.",1068595200,,1599,4.573943661971831
1365862,4,B00004WL4H,"This a a great video if you want to do a workout on your Abs.  You can really feel the workout through your abs area.  It may take a couple of ""gos"" at this video before you start to get the hang of it and feel it durning the workout.  Al does a great job (as usually) in explaining the poses.  I would recommend this video for anyone who is new to this practice.  I would not get this video if you have been doing Yoga for awhile the pace of the video may be too slow.",1068163200,,469,3.7938144329896906

1365864,4,B00004WL4H,"This tape consists of two short workouts--the box says that each is 20 minutes, though the actual timing is more like 18 minutes per workout.  The first is led by Al Bingham with assistant Jen, and the second is Jennifer with assistant Jeanne.  Both programs provide gentle stretching for the abs area.  There is a lot of instruction, which is good for beginners, but it also detracts from the intensity of the workout.  A few of the moves are held for an extended period of time and thus cause the muscles to work a little harder, but overall, I would classify this video as more of an abs relaxation/stretch rather than abs toning.  For a more intense yoga workout for abs, I recommend Rodney Yee's Abs Yoga for Beginners.",1041292800,,724,4.5813953488372094
1365865,1,B00004WL4H,"What a joke! I don't mind that this workout has no chance of giving me a six-pack -- that's not the point of yoga -- but I was expecting it to work out my abs at least a little. This is a total waste of time. The first 20-minute ""workout"" is totally useless; the second makes you work a tad harder, but still not enough to warrant the ($$$) this DVD cost. After years of daily use, maybe you stand some chance of toning your mid section with this tape, but if you're looking to see an improvement in this lifetime, go another route. People praise it for being easy; of course it's easy! It's not working! I'm trying Pilates next.",1030492800,,629,4.206611570247934
1365866,3,B00004WL4H,"i love yoga zone's studios and most of their videos. unfortunately, this one is below their high standards. it's very short and provides little workout -- even your abs won't feel much. there are 2 workouts and the 1st one is virtually useless whereas the second one does have some effect on the abs. in general, howeverm, the whole concept of this video is flawed and yoga zone should have known better. ""yoga"" means ""union"" which is inconsistent with the notion of targeted training. every yoga practise - even one targeted for the abs -- should have elements for your entire body, especially your spine. it should also have meditation. this tape has neither.",1014163200,,661,4.807017543859649
1365867,4,B00004WL4H,"After much thought and research I purchase this video along with another Yoga Zone beginner video and am happy to say that I am very happy with these choices.  The settings are very calming, the pace is good for beginner level some of the positions are a little complicated for the beginner level. He goes over some of the breathing techniques and helps you understand what you should feel if you are doing the poses correctly, which is very helpful.  The only reason I could rate this a 4 star is because the some of the poses are hurried along and the pace sometimes gets choppy and hard to follow.  Overall though I feel its a good buy to get exposed to yoga basics.",1011052800,,669,4.379032258064516
1365868,5,B00004WL4H,"I absolutely love waking up in the morning to Al (one of the two instructors featured on this DVD, as well as on Intro. to Power Yoga).  He's really great fun and takes you through a workout which is ideal, in my opinion, for all levels of practitionner and is much more intense than you first realise.  He has an incredible way of making you smile at the way he instructs (not at all cheesey like some Yoga instructors can be with their 'You're doing great' speeches!) and you really feel like you're enjoying the movements which is, after all, part of the experience.  Yoga is not meant to be a painful and complicated process, but graceful and fun exercises which make you more aware of your body.  The abs exercises are excellent, though a little tiring the first few times!  This is a powerful rather than gentle style of Yoga. But the length of the segments are just perfect for a before/after work workout.  I highly recommend Yoga Zone (especially Al!). The price is justified in that there isn't really much on these DVDs but shouldn't put anyone off.  These are thorough workouts and do work. Plus there's Al...!",992304000,,1122,4.58
1365869,3,B00004WL4H,"Although I only did this tape once, I couldn't help but feel that Yoga Zone was trying to cash in on a trend with this tape. That's one of the reasons why I like yoga. It's always been an ""alternative"" kind of fitness regimen, and with this tape, it seemed as if it was churned out, to keep up with the ""Yoga Fever"" that's been happening lately.

7925518,4,B00004WL4H,"Don't expect to rock hard abs from this workout. But to me yoga is about the mindful connection of breath to asanas.  I think the yoga zone instructors do a great job, to make these ab work outs accessible to anyone.

The on location in Jamaica is a nice change from bright light studios.  Al Bingham and his assistance are friendly, and joyous without being phony or annoying.

I always feel just right after completing these routines.  Many people feel they have to push with rigorous ashtanga type practices.. to me this is not the purpose of yoga..

These routines do develop emotional centering and ab toning.  Al does a great job talking about the subtle mindfulness of breath to posture.

I am delighted that I can supplement this dvd with others I like like AM/PM Rodney Yee.  My 80 year old mother loves this dvd as well, and is a size three with a pretty toned belly for that age.

The girls in the 2nd half of the dvd also over a slightly more rigorous routine without it feeling rushed or pushed..

What makes a great dvd for yoga is the connection between mind, body and breath. This does not feel rushed.  An excellent effort from yoga zone.
