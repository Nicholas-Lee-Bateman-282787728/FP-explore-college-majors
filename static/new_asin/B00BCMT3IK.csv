Monsuno Destiny-Season 1, episodes 1-5: Clash, Courage, Underground,Wicked,Knowledge
Monsuno Power-Season 1 episodes 6-10: Breakthrough,RSVP,Appleseeds,Eye,Deceit
third release are the first 5 episodes of SEASON TWO, go figure!
Monsuno Combat Chaos-Season 2, episodes 1-5: Flash, Bang,Mysterious,Antithesis,Kidnapped
each is 110 minutes, 5 episodes. The first and third I found for $1 each at Dollar Tree. The second, I came looking for on Amazon, but couldn't find out what episodes it included, due to the listing of Monsuno Power having two front views and NO back image. I requested amazon show a back image. They declined, which was annoying, so I went and bought Monsuno Power at another site.
Info was limited when I researched this series, but, near as I can find, Season one had 26 episodes and season two lists 18 episodes with 8 more TBD (to be developed)-don't know if they ever were.
Will post this on all three volumes , for people who are trying to figure out how they fit together.",1434758400,,1076,5.084745762711864

8566075,5,B00BCMT3IK,"Monsuno Power is about a boy named Chase Suno whose father has gone missing. Through his father's previous experiments Chase obtained a powerful creature and ally named Lock. Lock is a giant polar bear like creature with unfathomable abilities. Together with his friends Bren and Jinja who have obtained their own Monsunos-Quick force and Charger, they battle against the insidious forces of S.T.O.R.M.

In their battles they come face to face with an enemy that has sworn complete vengeance against Chase's dad the aggressive Dr. Eklipse. As these villains are trying to wield the power of the Monsunos for evil and make them weapons instead of defenders. Chase and his friends join allies with 2 new characters Dax and Beyal. Together they are trying to put an end to Dr. Eklipse and S.T.O.R.M.'s various schemes and discovers the secrets of Monsuno.

Monsuno dust brings Monsunos to life. Monsunos are different animals with DNA that come out of cylinders and you mix rocks and gems with them. The main character Gem is Polar Bear DNA and Blue Diamond mineral which creates a head strong Monsuno. With his diamond characteristic he can do mega energy blasts and has an in penetrable wall of defense.

My sons are 10 and 13 and they enjoyed the entire DVD Monsuno Power. The graphics were very clear and real. The storylines kept their interest, they watched this DVD in one sitting.",1369180800,,1385,4.885106382978724
