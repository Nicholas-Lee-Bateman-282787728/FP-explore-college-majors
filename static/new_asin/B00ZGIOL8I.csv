7282072,4,B00ZGIOL8I,"I could NEVER give any collection of Hammer films less than , at least , four stars . Having written that , I feel a strong obligation to point out the following to you....with the exception of Stop Me Before I Kill Again , these films can all be found on the Icons Of Horror Hammer Films collection . That's significant because , unlike this Mill Creek offering , that set of films contains English subtitles . Stop Me Before I Kill Again can be found on The Icons Of Suspense collection of Hammer Films .
As to aspect ratios , I'll leave that to the videophiles of which I most certainly am not one (respectfully) . This collection (Mill Creek) has a couple of fantastically cool selling points however . It's price is a wonderful $8.99 as of 9-19-2015 . Additionally , one can own films from a couple of different Hammer collections as an introduction to Hammer pictures . I feel fairly certain further investments will follow . I did the inverse and bought this set even though I own all these films . Perhaps a lucky recipient with thank me some day ? We shall see . No closed captions here either .",1442620800,31,1104,4.364077669902913

7282077,5,B00ZGIOL8I,"Some nice little gems hidden amidst the trash and boobs. Nothin wrong with the later. It is Hammer. Just some nicer surprises, like Sream of Fear and Stop Me Before I Kill.",1504483200,,172,4.40625
7282078,4,B00ZGIOL8I,"Hammer made his films in top quality. He had very top of the line, real looking sets built in medium and small sizes. He used just those sets. Often, he'd use close up, sometimes, extreme closeups. All this saved money on the budget. Back in the 60s we all knew Hammer films. We knew what to expect: Unknown English actors, top quality, slow moving story, somewhat uneven script, and horror. Sometimes monsters, other times killers. But always quality.
These films are just that. They are new prints and look far better than past 16MM copies released for TV. He used a lot of the same actors such as Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.
Ok, the audio; it's not bad at all but Scream of fear, I have my TV up all the way (the TV is on my desk at work) and I am still straining to hear it. Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll is not as bad but still low. Too much noise reduction? Too much compression?
The other films follow suit.
It was great fun to have summer vacations off and to see local TV stations run SciFi films and horror films like Hammer's. We also saw them in movie theaters on a bill with another  film after their initial run. This was typical kid experience in the 60s.
At the prices these are selling for on Amazon, I'd say buy it! Run it some evening while you wrap yourself in a blanket and lay on the couch or sit on the floor eating popcorn and drinking soda. Have a few friends over who are in the mood for slock. Hammer can be boring at times but he did make interesting films.",1501372800,,1486,4.232394366197183

I've not watched the other three movies included but - for the great price this collection is offered for, it was well worth the money!

7282096,5,B00ZGIOL8I,this was so cheap i had to get it if only for historical reference.  nvr been a huge hammer fan i preferred later tigon or hemdale productions because hammer always had that cheap soundstage look.  yet with some of these 60s low budget productions like the mummy one i see how it influenced that bit in deep red where the mad doll came rolling out of the closet...the lighting scheme looked identical!  some of these films also seemed to have a blurry look as if the camera operator were hungover or needed glasses.  still tho you can always count on the anglos to make a halfhearted attempt at a coherent script....kind of a relief after watching something like blood and roses where it was all visual style and very thin on plot and character development.,1470787200,,757,4.5851851851851855

7282111,3,B00ZGIOL8I,"This 2 disc set is decent, but somewhat of a letdown. The overall picture quality leaves a lot to be desired. I'm a fan of Hammer, and already owned a factory VHS copy of The Gorgon, one of my favorite Hammer flicks. I was really looking forward to a spectacular DVD image. Unfortunately the DVD version is somewhat soft looking and suffers badly from compression artifacts if you view on a big screen TV. I didn't see much in the way of sharper image detail when comparing it to my original VHS tape. To my eyes, a lot of the other films didn't look that great either. I like everything Hammer, but I have been informed that there are other sets available presenting these films with superior image quality.
If you can grab this on sale, or just want an instant Hammer collection, then go for it.",1460851200,,797,4.428571428571429
7282112,5,B00ZGIOL8I,"For all those ""Hammer"" film lovers, including those who enjoy watching Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, should purchase the 5 Movie Pack. The blu-Ray discs are NOT enhanced and more expensive. Nothing better than to have five favorites on two discs. My personal favorite is ""Curse of the Mummy's Tomb, (1964) and ""Horror Express, (1972),"" not on this collection. Both are a bit ""cheesy"" which is somewhat expected from Hammer films, yet always enjoyable!!!",1460592000,3,458,5.202702702702703

7282115,5,B00ZGIOL8I,"I am so glad to have this DVD - what a great selection of Hammer films!  I had only seen one of these when I was a kid, so I enjoyed them so much. The quality is good for their age, and Christopher Lee is again wonderful and handsome as a younger man.  Jimmy Sangster, Peter Cushing, and Terence Fisher also greatly contribute to the quality of the film's. I can highly recommend these films.",1457740800,,392,4.213333333333333

7282117,5,B00ZGIOL8I,"I LOVE Hammer movies. Scream of Fear is by far the best movie here. It's actually a bit scary, and has some gnarly plot twists that are REALLY good. It also had Christopher Lee in a minor role speaking in a delightful French accent. The Two Faces of Dr. Jekyll is pretty good, too, although it has way too many prostitutes, snake dancing and frilly panty/diapers. The Gorgon was pretty good, too, although when we finally see her at the end, it's a little...I don't know...it's not quite disappointing because I was forewarned, and she really is very ugly/frightening. The Curse of the Mummy was entertaining with an anti-Yank stereotype character and some good moments but a slight let down of a climax. Stop Me Before I Kill was very interesting with some twists and some disturbing moments. Altogether, great fun.",1457049600,5,816,4.794326241134752

7282119,5,B00ZGIOL8I,Classic Hammer films at their best!  Grew up with these horror flicks and have always been partial to the works of Cushing and Lee.  Great collection in this 5 movie pack....  And the Gorgon????  This film scared the Hell out of me fifty years ago....  And still does.  Look forward to future Hammer film collections.,1455753600,3,317,4.672727272727273
7282120,4,B00ZGIOL8I,"Three decent horror films and two Hitchcock-lite thrillers at a very good price. Picture quality and sound are good, considering the age of the source material. Fans of old horror films should be pleased.",1455408000,6,204,5.029411764705882

7282122,5,B00ZGIOL8I,Great dvd great service,1452556800,,23,5.0
7282123,4,B00ZGIOL8I,"I bought this set primarily for ""The Gorgon.""  I was a bit disappointed, not by the film but by the DVD mastering of the print.  It is extremely blurry.  The other film on the same disc, ""Two Faces of Dr. Jecklyll,"" is razor-sharp.  So I don't know what went wrong in the mastering process, but obviously something did.

Speaking of ""Jeckyll,"" I was surprised at how gorgeous the film was.  Hammer spared no expense producing this in Technicolor and true Cinemascope (not the wretched half-frame Techniscope ripoff of later years).  As usual, costumes and scenery are outstanding.  What a shame they lavished all that on a ponderous, predictable script.  They should have given this kind of treatment to ""Dracula, Prince of Darkness"" instead.

Another interesting film is on disc two:  ""Curse of the Mummy's Tomb"" also looks good, with beautiful set design, cinematography and color.  Once again though, the script is poor; none of the characters are likeable and the story meanders, with one dreadfully weak scene wherein the British police attempt to apprehend the mummy.  Hammer should have truncated this scene before the film's release.

""Scream of Fear"" is an unsung gem, fascinating to watch the first time around.  One spends the first half of the film thinking it's a very simple and obvious plot to kill an heiress for money.  The truth is much more compelling.  The last ten minutes are sensational.

""Stop Me Before I Kill"" might better have been named, ""Stop Me Before I Yawn.""  It is written and directed by Val Guest in the style of a stage drama; very talky, with endless patter delivered at lightning speed to keep the audience awake.  The plot centers around a race car driver who recently sustained a head injury and his quicksilver temper.  Approximately every 3 minutes, the script cycles through his happy banter with his new bride, an innocent remark of hers sparking his insane jealousy, a big fight, her asking what's wrong with him and him meekly apologizing.  They repeat this over and over again throughout the film.  You won't enjoy it.

Overall, several hours of second-tier Hammer fun.",1452124800,15,2116,4.9124293785310735
