8455153,5,B0053D9E0G,"I too have awaited this movie to come out on DVD, but like many great movies people are trying to sell them for these very high prices. One would think Amazon would see to it that those who are trying to gauge buyers could do something to control this practice.",1477785600,3,261,4.24
8455154,1,B0053D9E0G,"FYI, DVD of this great mini-series was never-ever released(maybe some legal issues?) What this skinflints were trying to sell here for $500 was absolutely unwatchable VHS copy made to DVD set. I have one of this(bought it years ago for $35 from the company  that doesn't exist anymore). Tons of frustration!!!!",1416787200,5,310,5.078431372549019
8455155,2,B0053D9E0G,Surely somebody has a copy that is cheaper than $447.  Could it have been a typo?  That price is ridiculous!,1412640000,4,108,4.35
8455156,1,B0053D9E0G,"500.00 ! That's obscene ! I have waited tears for this story to come to DVD. I have checked periodically, but never in my wildest thought could have imagine such a price tag!  I put this novel and movie right up there  with  The Thorn Birds and only paid 50.00 before it came down to 25.00!!!!  I'll keep looking or maybe I should just come to the realization, it's never going to be part of my collection , I can't and won't pay 500.00!!!!!!",1408320000,8,442,4.226190476190476
