We saw it at the movies as kids when you could go in and see a double feature and stay all day at the theatre. We actually saw it twice as kids because it was so bad and we laughed so hard we wanted to go back and see what bad parts we'd missed so we could laugh some more. I don't even remember what the main feature was!

If you enjoy Ed Wood type bad movies like Plan 9 From Outer Space, you will enjoy laughing at this horribly made film made back in the ""blaxploitation"" picture days. One scene I remember is when this guy gets so very frightened he actually runs nonstop back home to Alabama. I don 't mean that he gets in a car or hops a plane---he hot foots it all the way home!

Horrible movie; good laugh.",1245110400,9,877,3.893854748603352
