331629,2,6301475917,"Although some prefer this approach, I found the slow, casually paced, breathy-voiced presentation annoying.  I would have liked more direct instruction of the physical techniques.
On a more technical note, the  demonstrated stances would have been easier to understand with more visual  aids or better camera angles.",948240000,2,316,5.680851063829787
331630,4,6301475917,"The Yoga Journal series of tapes are in the style of Iyengaryoga, which uses props such as blocks, straps, folded blankets,furniture, etc., as an aid in performing the postures.  (I personally find such props distracting, and I prefer to just go as far in each pose as I can without bothering with them, but I still like philosophy of this style.)  Iyengar stresses precision of alignment, and here I think this tape excels, making it a very good beginner's tape as well as a reference.  I agree with the other reviewers who find it slow and lacking in production values - there is no waterfall or other natural wonder in the background, as in the Living Yoga series, nor is there a classroom full of attractive bodies like you find in the Bryan Kest tapes. It is more like good medicine, not necessarily tasty, but definitely good for you.  Once you get familiar with it, you will find yourself using your remote to get down to work, as there is an awful lot of filler - first ads for other tapes, then titles stating all the cautions, then an odd little video of Patricia flowing through some poses in a flowing costume, then the practice; oh, but first she gabs at you for awhile about all the benefits of yoga... I just leave it cued to where the standing poses begin, do them, finish the tape or not depending on time, and have a productive session.  There is a guided relaxation in the end which is good, if you don't crack up at Patricia earnestly asking you to feel you eyeballs shrinking.  The time spent on getting Mountain pose exactly right at the beginning of the session is a good reminder, but you wouldn't want to do it every day.  There are a number of different styles of the yoga of physique, i.e. Hatha Yoga (and then there are many other branches of yoga, pertaining to all aspects of life).  Those looking for the sweat-inducing, so-called Power Yoga will not find it here, as that is the Ashtanga form, where poses flow more quickly and without pauses. But I feel that all yoga practioners would do well to try this tape and the others in the series for their focus on alignment. Proper alignment is important to avoid strain and injury and to reap the full benefit of the poses, which after all are ancient and work on many subtle levels beyond being the latest workout craze.  They are meant to effect internal organs, glands, as well as subtle energy centers. You don't want to be crunching down and collapsing in places where you need to be lifted and open, and this is easy to forget.  So practice with Patricia and build a good foundation for your future as a yogini.",933638400,67,2596,4.492569002123142
331651,5,6301475917,"This program is, as the title implies, for BEGINNERS.  If you are used to doing aerobics, you may become impatient with the methodical pace, or unnerved by Patricia Walden's freakishly serene demeanor.  Following the short ""show-off"" intro (where Ms. Walden does a standing backbend that I immediately set as a long-term goal for myself), the actual instructional portion of the program is easy to understand and follow.  There is a lot of explanation and demonstration, including modifications of the poses and the use of props to help those who are less flexible.
Reviewers who have found it boring or ""too easy"" are perhaps approaching this the wrong way.  You set your own pace, and there are no poses that a practitioner is ever ""done"" with.  As a klutzy, non-athletic person, I was thrilled the first time I did this program and was able to get through it without feeling flustered or uncoordinated.  I did this tape and nothing else for a year before I felt like I needed to ""move on.""  While I'll always prefer taking a live class, I highly recommend the Yoga Journal series, and especially this tape.",1021248000,14,1109,4.8052631578947365
331652,2,6301475917,"I thought that this video was very slow moving. I think it is an extremely beginner video that can only be watched a few times, but after that it gets extremely irritating because you sit and wait for too long in between each pose.  I think there are many other beginner yoga videos that would be much more suitable.",1019606400,4,316,4.3559322033898304
331653,5,6301475917,This was my first yoga video and i actually really enjoyed it. It really gets your flexability up to par. Some of the moves are pretty difficult but are wonderful for getting limber. I think Waldon did and exclent job of explaing how do do the moves and use your body for the poses. I wonderful introduction to yoga.,1016928000,3,316,4.372881355932203
331654,5,6301475917,"For those confused and complaining about the ""slowness"" and props, you should know that the Iyengar yoga style is based completely on precise alignment and use of props FOR THOSE WHO NEED THEM. You can do all of the postures w/out props if you are flexible enough. So, if you're interested in faster paced yoga, DO NOT buy Yoga Journal tapes unless they are listed as Power Yoga. The video is perfectly done in the Iyengar style.",1016150400,7,429,4.584415584415584
331655,4,6301475917,"In 2001, when there weren't nearly as many yoga options on the market as there are today, I wanted to try yoga, and this video seemed liked a good place to start. The thing I liked the best about it was that even though I was in my 30s, had never done yoga before, and had never been very flexible, I could do ALL of the postures. Of course, my form wasn't always perfect and I did have to modify at times, but at least I was able to approximate the basic poses, which I found very gratifying. Instructor Patricia Walden does use props, but I found that I could make do without or by using substitutions (e.g., a thick book instead of a yoga block).

One caution about this video is that it definitely moves slowly, as Patricia takes quite a bit of time for instruction in-between each posture. Because of this, it's probably best viewed as an instructional video rather than a complete yoga practice. I also found Patricia's instruction style to be rather dry (although I didn't find her condescending as some others have mentioned). Once I became more familiar with the postures, I usually fast-forward past Patricia's instruction, and eventually, as I progressed further, I got rid of this video altogether. Although there are many more options for those new to yoga available today, I still think this is a solid foundation that can serve as a good place to begin your yoga journey.",1011916800,6,1386,4.588709677419355
331656,1,6301475917,This is an excruciatingly slow video.  It's difficult to 'flow' through the positions because the instructor is so slow.  I would not recommend this to beginners-I'm sure there are better paced videos on the market.,1011830400,5,215,5.114285714285714
331657,1,6301475917,"This video is sooooooooooo slow moving you will not want to put it in your VCR more than once.  It is good for your very first instruction to get you acquainted with the poses, but that?s it!  Choose another one of Living Art?s beginner videos; you?ll be more motivated to use it more than once.  They move a little faster (thank goodness), but you?ll catch on quickly.",1007856000,2,369,4.477611940298507
331658,5,6301475917,"Patricia Walden is a careful teacher, demonstrating each position with accuracy and multiple times for the viewer. This is truly a tape for those who know nothing about yoga and have had no previous experience. I bought this tape after taking yoga classes for a few months and had to give it to a friend because it was too easy for me.
Yoga Practice for Beginners is definitely instructional. I recommend watching the tape at least once before trying any of the positions.
Note, Patricia Walden, although I think she is a thorough instructor, is very mellow and some consider her to be boring or annoying.",1007510400,3,605,4.716981132075472
331659,1,6301475917,"I received this as a gift. I love yoga and thought this was the most boring and sleepy yoga tape I ever saw. The plain white room and monotone voice made me catatonic every time. You are mostly forced to use props (which also annoyed me) and as for the poses, it is not the easiest tape for the beginner. I might recommend this more to an intermediate. Honestly, for me, I thought the Yoga Zone collections were much more interesting.",1004227200,2,434,4.37037037037037
331670,5,6301475917,"Because of recent chemotherapy, I was left with a side effect that caused neuropathy in my feet and have a lot of leg pain.  I was not able to do regular excercises, like arobics or jogging.  This tape has done wonders for me.  I can keep up with the beginners stretches and poses without hurting my legs or feet.  I also find it to be relaxing and feel I am stretching muscles slowly that have actually made my legs feel better.  I have started slowly and try to do a little every day.  I would recommend this video for anyone who may have problems doing rigorous excercises.  That's why I rated it a five star.  It really works for me.",1000857600,6,637,4.25
331671,3,6301475917,"I have several other yoga videos which i use regularly.  I was excited to get this one. But I was very dissapointed at the amount of equipment that is nessisary to do many of the poses. I wish that the equipment list was listed on the box. If I would have know that I would need 2 yoga bricks, a yoga strap and several pillows of various sizes... I would not have purchased this video. There are many others out there that do not require the additional expense. But, if you already have all the stuff, or don't mind spending another $..., then the practice is good.",1000425600,6,565,4.280373831775701
331672,5,6301475917,"I teach yoga and I recommend this video for ALL my beginning students. It is very slow and detailed, so if you already have a regular practice, it might not seem very challenging. For students who are just starting out, its just the ticket, though. The instructions on the tape are clear and above all very SAFE, so you won't get injured if you follow along closely. I also like to watch it every now and then from an instructors point of view. Patricia Walden, the instructor on this tape is a true professional. I just bought another copy of this tape to send to a student who has moved away.",998611200,,594,4.36036036036036
331673,5,6301475917,"I think this tape is great for someone like myself who has poor flexibility initially, it explains/demonstrates modifications well. Who knows maybe someday I'll be as flexible as Patricia!",997056000,,188,5.517241379310345
331674,5,6301475917,"I found this video very useful. I was practicing a routine from a book, which was good but with this video when I am in a pose she mentions things like lengthening your spine and pushing your shoulders back and I realize that I was not getting the most out of the pose. She also gives you time to sink into the pose and focus on how your body feels. She stresses listening to and respecting your body. Afterwards I feel strong, refreshed and alive.",995760000,,448,4.2823529411764705
331675,1,6301475917,"This tape has really turned me away from the whole concept of yoga!  I always thought I was a relatively patient person, but after 20 minutes of this tape I found myself getting out the nerf gun with the sticky darts and shooting them at the TV for fun!  Are all yoga tapes this boring!?  She goes extremely slowly (she waits sooo long between positions that you might as well take a nap) and has a high, drugged voice which drives me crazy!  Perhaps I am just not cut out for yoga, but I really agree with the one of the other reviewers in that she seems to be lobotomized.",993945600,2,574,4.1909090909090905
331676,5,6301475917,"I have had several of Patricia Walden(as well as Rodney Yee's) videos for several years. The ""Yoga For Beginners"" video is an excellent place not only to start, but also to use for review. I often watch it when I'm doing preparatory warmups before my yoga routine to help me review and reinforcethe details of specific poses before heading into my yoga routine.
 This is very helpful because in many of the other videos in the Yoga Journal series, the pace is much faster and you don't have the level of detail in the instruction given in ""Yoga for Beginners"".
  Once you have the basics down its much easier to follow videos such as ""Yoga for Strength"" and ""Yoga Remedies...""  which move at a much faster pace and incorporate vinyasa(which is a series of poses in succession). Still, even when you've worked with those tapes for a while, it's nice to be able to go back to the Yoga for beginners tape from time to time for that extra, more detailed and slower instruction.
  One more thing that I particularly like is that Patricia Walden does the poses in a ""mirror image"" to you so you can move directly with her instead of having to ""transpose"" the poses (asanas) to the opposite side. That eliminates a lot of confusion and makes it easier to relax into the practice instead of trying to reverse everything in your mind.
 I have turned many people on to this video tape as a way to get started in Yoga and recommend it highly!",992044800,32,1431,4.501930501930502
331677,5,6301475917,"A very good beginner's yoga video. This video offers a series of stretches and positions with fairly clear instructions and tips for the novice. I have used it many times and still return to it when I want a simple at-home yoga practice. It leaves me feeling well-stretched, refreshed, and relaxed. The overall quality of the video encouraged me to check-out others in the Living Arts series. If you are a beginner, try to get the version with the free illustrated booklet that explains each of the poses.",989366400,3,505,4.75
331688,4,6301475917,"This tape should be called ""Yoga Practice for People Who Have Never, Ever Done Yoga Before"".  It does a good job in giving beginners a foundation, but it is not much of a ""yoga"" workout.",985478400,3,186,4.314285714285714
331689,3,6301475917,"I found this tape useful for methodically explaining how to perform each of the postures, but much too slow for someone who already has a good foundational knowledge of yoga.  If you've done other yoga tapes before, buy this tape only if you're still unclear about how to do the poses.  Otherwise, you'll quickly become bored.  I probably won't use this tape again, but might recommend it for a friend who wants to try yoga, but has no experience with it whatsoever.",980121600,12,466,4.658536585365853
331690,4,6301475917,"Ok, if you got to my review, you are probably very disappointed with the video, BUT I feel that just as the others, I am entitled to my own opinion and that is exactly what I want to share you.
Even though I had heard many negative things about yoga, when I saw the video for the first time, I had no idea exactly what yoga was about.  However, after I saw and practice the video, I felt great.  I felt very relaxed and I was even able to sleep much better.  I feel that the video has helped me pay attention to my body and my person as well.  When I am faced with a situation, I can easily stand back, take a good look at the  situation and then react to that situation. Thanks to Patricia Walden, I have learned to relax and to enjoy life much better.  It is great!",977097600,4,767,3.980392156862745
331691,2,6301475917,"A dis-appointment.  A video too long with so much ads and filler. Patricia Walden tries so hard to prove the beauty of yoga, that she fails miserably. An good example of which is a scene before the practice in which she practices yoga (a tad poor IMO), in front of a sand dune. Another sad dis-appointment is the exclusion of the sun salutations. Every beginner should know these basic stretches.",977097600,2,396,4.6571428571428575
331692,2,6301475917,"I rented this video from Blockbuster as my introduction to yoga videos (I had taken classes but they are pretty steep in price.) I am glad I did not buy it, because after about the 4th viewing I was ready to say goodbye to  Patricia! I found the poses unchallenging, and to be honest, her voice is a  tad annoying.

331694,2,6301475917,"As a beginner, I found this tape too hard and too boring.  And I didn't like the requirement of yoga props which I of course didn't have.  And it was irritating to have to dig around the entire house to try to find things  to use for props.",949968000,6,240,3.9583333333333335
331695,5,6301475917,"It's been 16 years since I took a yoga class in college, and this tape (and the accompanying booklet) was a great re-introduction to 17 or so of the core yoga poses.  I really like how Patricia takes the time to explain  how to properly come into and out of a pose, as well as proper alignment.  I also appreciate the use of props, not being as limber as I once was.  These props can be easily improvised from things around the house, and  allow you to receive the benefits of the poses without straining.  As I've  progressed in my practice, I've moved on to other, faster-moving videos  like Yoga for Energy with Rodney Yee (which I was not able to keep up with  at first, not being sure about proper alignment and position), but I still  come back to this video (and the accompanying booklet) for review.  As I've  advanced a little now, I find myself holding some of the poses longer as  she goes through the explanations.  Eventually, I will completely move  beyond this level, but I sure am glad that this video helped ease me back  into yoga.  I highly recommend it for beginners.",949276800,83,1087,4.436548223350254

Using this video gave me a very good foundation and understanding. I was able to move on to other  videos with confidence after that. But I do hardly ever use it now because  it is slow and paced for beginners. I use it sometimes when I want to  review alignment or if I don't feel up to a strenuous work. If you are a  beginner I can't think of a better way to start -- but you won't stay  there. But isn't that the sign of a good teacher?,948758400,9,559,3.911504424778761

This tape sounded perfect.  I understand how many reviewers found this tape too slow, but once you know the poses you can just slip into the pose while it is being described and hold it a bit longer.  For a sixty-plus year old this tape is wonderful.  I nearly always drift off during the relaxation time at the end of the tape, but after this yoga session my body feels absolutely exhilarated which is why I gave the tape five stars.",1509753600,,611,4.1440677966101696

Also, for beginners especially, it would be nice if there was a little more flow.  It's usually easier to go into side angle (side stretch or whatever she calls it) and THEN into triangle instead of just standing and going directly into triangle.  Then there's the names . . . what she calls ""cobbler's pose"" is actually bound angle.  I understand not wanting to use the Sanskrit names, but seriously?",1299542400,,692,4.631147540983607

There were only one or two moves that I couldn't do without block or other aids and the repetition of the moves a second time (to learn the moves) bored me.  It was all super basic stuff from my first week of yoga.
