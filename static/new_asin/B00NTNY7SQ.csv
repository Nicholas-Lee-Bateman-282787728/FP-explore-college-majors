6679843,2,B00NTNY7SQ,"... Not sure what to say about this movie... I am a big fan of the wrong turn series, I own every wrong turn movie, but I just am not sure what to say about this one. I thought I didn't like the third one too much but I think this was was in fact the worse out of all of them. I'm not sure if the movie seemed like it was rushed, pieced together and leaving you asking questions, or just all over the place. Also I'm not sure if all the actors fit the part of the movie... I don't want to give away the movie but there was to much human and not enough hillbilly action and when there was hillbilly action it seemed really fake. Also on the back of the movie case it says Danny has a choice to face, I'm not sure what what Danny had to pick because he didn't do much thinking...(if you seen the movie you will know what I am talking about)...
Compared to the other wrong turns: Wrong turn 1- was the original so it was different for the movie scene, so many people liked it (horror fans), Wrong turn 2- This one was really great! The concepts in this movie was awesome and I loved the hillbilly family, Wrong turn 3-... was a down fall, Wrong turn 4- I liked how they showed the hillbillies in the beginning and I loved the twist at the end, Wrong turn 5-..was ok...just ok..., Wrong turn 6- All over the place, and very fast.
If another wrong turn movie comes out I wish they would make one similar to wrong turn 2 maybe with more family members (all hillbillies). It gives more of a scare to the film, I think... However if the future of wrong turn movies are going to be similar to wrong turn 6 then they should stop making these movies.",1413849600,5,1639,4.077399380804954

6679846,3,B00NTNY7SQ,"Danny (Anthony Ilott) unexpectedly inherits the Hobbs Springs Hotel and is eager to meet family he has never known. He takes along with him a group of victims, er ah friends. Seems Danny has been brought back to take over the hotel for the fine young cannibals and to preserve the purity of the blood line to the dismay of his girl friend (Aqueela Zoll).

What's to say? I liked #4 the best especially the opening classical music scene which they have failed to top. This is 80's style slasher, naked girls, kill them in different ways, and eat the body parts. ""Fun is the kind of therapy we all need.""

The town has a board full of missing people and a puppy. This film sets up for what could be a great sequel if they got some writers.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Aqueela Zoll, Sadie Katz, Roxanne Pallett, Talitha Luke-Eardley)",1413676800,12,824,4.48
6679847,1,B00NTNY7SQ,"6 movies and they still don't die. This series has gotten to a point in which it is dragging itself with the same premise most of the time and it is pointless a decade later. This movie is a lackluster one and some of the killings are idiotic. Most people are fans of this type of genre and film making but I grew tired of it after the 2nd movie. The sad thing is that it'll probably end with at least 10 movies before Hollywood comes up and says: ""You know what, lets do a Reboot of the franchise''. Then it'll be another decade long run of this series in a different way...",1413504000,2,575,4.097345132743363
6679848,4,B00NTNY7SQ,Very surprised with this one. Much more plot driven than previous entries with better characters too. A dark tone and atmosphere is held throughout. The kills are as graphic as ever and the gore is a nice mixture of practical and some cgi.

6679849,2,B00NTNY7SQ,"""I want to meet these people and find out what I'm all about."" Danny (Iloot) has just found out that that he has inherited a mysterious resort in West Virginia. Him and his friends decide to take the trip to see what he has. When they arrive they meet Jackson and Sally (Katz) who claim to be his relatives. What starts out as an exciting new adventure take a deadly turn when family secrets are revealed. So...what can I say about Wrong Turn 6? If you have seen the others then you will know what to expect from this. There is a lot of gore and cannibalism. So if that is your thing then you will love this. When most horror franchises get into the 5th and 6th movies they turn more comedic. This one hasn't done that yet, I'm not sure if that's a good or a bad thing. What I do know is that this is a series that didn't need one sequel let alone 5. Overall, if you have seen the others then you might at well watch this one. I give this a C-.",1413331200,7,944,4.026595744680851

6679868,2,B00NTNY7SQ,"I saw the 1st and 2nd movies in this series as well as half of the 4th one on cable TV. The 1st and 2nd movies were OK and both seemed in line with the story line of a family of inbred mutants residing in the back woods out of sight and scrutiny of civilized people. The 2nd movie furthered the storyline with an explanation for their mutation (besides being inbred). The 2nd movie indicated that tainted drinking water caused their mutations. Seemed a reasonable enough explanation.

I missed the 3rd movie. The 4th movie I only saw the second half and it made no sense whatsoever and seemed to be an unnecessary addition to the series. Actually, the only reason I watched any of these movies after the 1st one was to see if/how someone was going to kill off these degenerates. Didn't happen in the 4th one, which brings us to this 6th one. Yeah, I missed the 5th one as well (I really don't like these movies because they never kill off the mutants).

This 6th movie was ridiculous and absurd and changes the storyline. Instead of being mutated through tainted drinking water, they were all mutated through inbreeding. Not only that, this movie comes up with the absurd revelation .....

caution...SPOILER ALERT:

The original family of 3 mutants residing in a shack in the sticks has been discarded. Now we have a whole community of 10 or 15 mutants residing in a shack in the sticks who have been inbreeding since civil war times and they built a large, expensive luxury hotel where several presidents have stayed at. Yeah, that's right, a bunch of inbred family members (at least the normal looking ones) built a large, expensive luxury hotel that rich and famous people stayed in.

More SPOILERs:
Not only are they inbred mutants, but, they are aristocratic, snobby inbreds that are looking for a long lost  inbred pure blood (to further their pure blood line) who grew up in the big city (he didn't know his parents or where he came from) and he was depressed and tried to commit suicide because he didn't fit in. Yet, he was fairly well off because he was involved in the stock market and he has a girlfriend and snobby friends.

SPOILER ALERT over.
Anyway, the guy finds out he has inherited this old hotel and goes to see it with his snooty friends. The manager and his sister/girlfriend (they make no bones about this relationship with the guests either) are eager for the new owner to take over and start grooming him for the job. As expected, the 3 mutants from the title of the series start bumping off the guy's friends and he becomes a loser of a friend. One of the rules of any decent, quality horror movie is for the writer, director, and the actors to make the innocent characters likeable so the audience cares if they live or die. Like a cheesy, low/no quality Z grade movie, the director and writers don't make the characters likeable with the exception of the fat guy with glasses (don't remember his name because I didn't care) who at least tries to save the others and the skinny guy who follows his friend to look out for him.

This movie is totally absurd. A large, luxury hotel (it is in need of some remodeling but is still a luxury hotel) that is having guests stay there and the mutant trio kills a few of the guests and no one notices except for the Sheriff's Office that posts ""Missing"" posters at the convenience store? At the beginning of the movie the mutants kill a couple out bicycling on the property and then an old rich lady staying with a group of old folks. Later they kill ....SPOILER ALERT.........
a Deputy Sheriff and run his car off the road. No one ever comes looking for the missing Deputy or his patrol car????? By the end of the movie they have killed the young couple bicyclists, the old rich lady, the Deputy Sheriff, and the 5 friends of the main character, and the main character takes over the hotel and no one comes looking for any of these missing people?????

SPOILER ALERT off.
Anyway, the absurdity of the events and the storyline make this the most ridiculous of this series. I probably won't be watching any more of these because I don't think they will ever kill off the mutants (which is all I want to see). The cinematographer was great. Great cinematography, terrible plot and storyline. As I mentioned before, a good horror movie (even a low budget one) will make the characters sympathetic to the audience. The majority of these characters were not sympathetic and I didn't care whether they died or not. What's the point? Seems like the director only wanted to make a movie where the characters were nothing more than a means to show gruesome murders and nothing more. That's a total waste and pointless.

I used to watch the old Friday the 13th movies just to see how they were going to kill the Jason character at the end. They did not kill off all the characters and kept you in suspense to see which of the characters were going to survive because some did and usually the ones (not always) you were rooting for. I don't like movies where everybody dies. That's pointless. You get to the point where you know that everyone is going to die, so why watch it in the first place?",1505433600,2,5150,4.516094420600858

I realize all the Wrong Turn flix have sex and nudity and that is cool, but this is nothing more than incestual porn for those enjoy dirty naughty bad sister/cuzzin sex and that is BAD! Secondary. The story has been done to death and has absolutely no originality to it what so ever. the first 6 minutes were pretty good and give you hope, but then it takes a hillbilly twist and then splatters all over the place like an egg in a frying pan. And third... They should have brought back Declan O'Brian to continue the franchise. He took over as director for part 3 and then as writer/director for parts 4 and 5. Which in my opinion were all pretty darn good considering the obvious small budgets and being made in foreign countries with foreign actors posing as American horn dogs. The point is they had a working system and working formula and they screwed it up all because one idiot had to say ""Heeey... I got an idea."" The last dumba$$ to say that ruined Prometheous.

Instead of a Wrong Turn movie, this is a lurid European style vampire movie without the vampires, the sort of thing that Jean Rollin or Jess Franco could have pulled of brilliantly but here falls worse than flat; and the real insult is that the hillbillies have essentially nothing to do with it.

That was a bad idea and you can guess where  a good chunk of my christmas went. After reading reviews i expected a film that would make wrong turn 3 look good, i was actually a little impressed with what is the 6th entry in a low budget series. It had a decent story and gives and origin to the cannibals.

That being said i give 4 stars for what it is, a low budget b movie. Some of the actors did good, others were there. The cannibal family and there little homestead was cool but there is no ma and pa or brother and sister or old man from the previous movies. My biggest complaint had to be the look of the 3 main cannibals. There was never a decent shot of one eye or sawtooth and what you did see looked a lot more human than in past entries. 3 finger just looked fake, like the actor was wearing a thick plastic mask.

I guess the plot is similar to the last Texas chainsaw movie, the cast is pretty decent I guess, your usual fodder for the freaks to pick off one by one, the movie has the classic formula that they all traditionally follow of course which is your inventive bloody gory death scenes and there is plenty of good ones with a mix of good practical gore and some CGI, of course as usual there is some sex and nudity it wouldn't be wrong turn without it! The movie has a typical classic open death scene, it slows down a tad sometimes while we get the story then it picks back up towards the end!

Part 6 picks up when a down-on-his-luck college student (nudge/nudge; wink/wink) finds he has inherited a getaway in the mountains.  Up in them-thar woods hides the infamous trio of cannibals.  Seems they just constantly run amok, kidnap, torture, rape, and then eat their victims...and the ONE policeman in them-thar parts can't ever figure it out.

But, I digress.  It seems in this installment, all involved decided to take it up a notch by allowing the gruesome threesome to now indulge themselves while watching a long-lost relative have sex...with his SISTER.  I see where this film can now hardly be found anywhere.  Hmmmmm.....wonder why?  I think the name ""Wrong Turn 6:  LAST RESORT"" kinda' says it all.

I still think the whole series has suffered by making the hillbilly family WAY too cleaned up and washed and Hollywood-ish. The first film was far more believable in that they were filthy, grimy, and actually believable as backwoods killers.

I thought the storyline was fresh for the franchise and where part 5 failed miserably with its cheap makeshift town and cheap sets this has rich locales and good production value. The hot springs were a great addition and brought to mind the film Hostel.

The characters were interesting and easy to either like or hate! The kills were really well done and gory and really amp up in the last thirty minutes. This film also gave me one of my favorite kills in Wrong Turn history in the form of an enema from hell!

Towards the end of the film Jackson and Sally take new ""brother"" Danny ""the new owner of the Hobbs Springs Hotel and new family member of the Hilliker clan"" to the little village near the spa where obviously the busiest person in town is the tooth fairy. This is where Danny is introduced to his new kin including three finger,saw tooth and one eye. The other family members were fun to see and their makeup was actually done better than the three main inbreds.

6680026,1,B00NTNY7SQ,Has the Wrong Turn franchise gone on too long? I think so. This appears to be a low budget film aimed at capitalizing on the success of the first couple of films. The storyline was a bit outlandish and the acting horrific. There were really only 2 or 3 short scenes that had a 'cool' factor.,1414540800,,291,4.214285714285714
6680027,1,B00NTNY7SQ,Horrible movie,1414454400,,14,6.5
6680028,5,B00NTNY7SQ,"Running Time Approx. 1 hr. 30 min. Hi-Def. Picture and Sound. This movie is an improvement from the last two installments #(4&5), which where absolutely horrible! I'm still trying to figure out how they got funding for garbage like that, and the last producer should be fired and never allowed to produce again. However, this movie is actually a high-quality film than previous. This movies props and sets are stunning. The storyline for once, was decent for this kind of film.  I was impressed with all of the improvements, to include a better producer, and script writing, which makes all the difference. This Franchise has a fan base, but it can lose ALL of its fans with poor quality cheesy work. I think this film has actually given new life to the franchise and saved it. I expect the next installment to be even better than this one. In my opinion the best ""Wrong Turn"" installments are films (1, 2, and 3), but this latest one comes really close to being very successful as film (1).

The Facts:

1. This movie is full of intense gore and cannibalism
2. This film contains  extreme incestuous relations
3. This film is NOT for kids under 13
4. Cinematography is amazing
5. Props, wardrobes and sets are very good
6. All acting are very good and impressive
7. The storyline is much improved
8. Warning: Has way too much unnecessary sex
9. Some sex scenes are way too graphic. Not for kids under 13
10. Overall, film is fair, despite areas in film that are unnecessary
11. Great Friday night creeper entertainment for (Adults)
12. Small attempt at character development

There are NO dry-boring areas in the movie, but there are areas that are completely unnecessary and could have been left out of the script. Overall, I think this movie is ok. It's a thousand times better than the last two horrible movies (4&5). Moving forward, I do recommend that produces start redesigning and introducing better looking mutants in the next film. Seeing the same character mutants in every film with poor unrealistic (make-up) design will kill your fan base quickly, and I can't take the film serious at this point. Bring in new mutants with better designs, maybe hire some of the talent from (FACE-OFF) to help, because whoever is on the payroll now is NOT working! And let's see less unnecessary (sex scenes) and a more substantive scripts.

Overall, this movie is vast improved from the last two, so I will award (5) stars, for that reason only.

6680029,2,B00NTNY7SQ,It would have been interesting if the movie had been anything like the trailer.  But there was no obvious connection.  Dumb plot.  Bad acting.  Gratuitous violence.,1414368000,,164,5.1923076923076925
6680030,2,B00NTNY7SQ,"I keep watching the gory mess in these Wrong Turn movies, hoping that they would have made an attempt at some plot twists, but alas! If I were to choose a favorite, it would probably be the one about the participants in a reality survival filming. These are the movies that eventually wear themselves out. The acting was so-so.",1414368000,2,327,4.559322033898305
6680031,2,B00NTNY7SQ,"I can't believe I can even get my fingers to tap this phrase out, but--6 was better than 5. This is only true because 5 was an unmitigated travesty. But at least 6 jumps a different shark in a moderately diverting way. The acting and setting were better as well.

My main complaint about WT6 is that it was just so cynical and so lazy in its cynicism.

It almost seems to have started with a script for another movie completely, but one that could only sell if reworked so it could be attached to a bankable franchise. I think the movie it started its life as was probably a better movie, because once you've seen the hideous cannibals kill and growl and laugh hysterically and chop off limbs to boil, grill, braze and fry, there's just not a ton left to do with them besides cranking that knob to 11.5 on the graphic gross-out dial. Yet to get the movie made, that had to be grafted in.

And just to hedge our bets here, let's throw in a half-dozen otherwise senseless scenes of nekkid folks in various stages of the nasty and/or high--preferably with mutant cannibals leering and grunting because THAT'LL bring back the sexy.

I once read the mark of a great comedy is that if you took out the jokes, it would still be an enjoyable experience. The example given was ""Ghostbusters,"" which works great as a comedy but would be a pretty fun movie even without the comedic elements.

Take out the various porn elements in WT6 and you have almost nothing left. With genre movies like this, expectations can and should be pretty low. But if you went to a fast-food place that ONLY sold you salted fat, with no pretense toward any added flavors or textures or presentation, you can't argue that they didn't hit the right primal stimuli. But it's just not that appealing.",1414368000,7,1765,4.485981308411215
6680032,2,B00NTNY7SQ,Wasn't as good as the trail or made it out to be...it is a decent movie but not as good as the first wrong turn,1414195200,,111,3.48
6680033,2,B00NTNY7SQ,"In Hollywood, once a movie comes out and makes more revenue than anticipated, sequels are bound to come. It's been seen before several times: whether it was Friday the 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or the Saw franchise, all had sequels after the capital success of the first film. Unfortunately, it seems that as the series went on, the movies got less and less original, and relied more on gore than actual scares. No sequel lived up to the original film, and it became clear that these films were being made solely for revenue. For a long while, this also seemed to hold true for Wrong Turn.
The strange thing is that no matter how awful each sequel was in each of these series, I continued to watch, mostly to see the new scenes of gore and to see if anything was brought to the table. With Wrong Turn films, each got progressively worse after the first two. Three relied on CGI for most of the gore effects with a storyline about prisoners being ambushed on their way to the clinker that had so many holes in its plot I could have probably had sex with them. Four attempted to be a prequel that didn't explain the bloodline of the cannibal clan quite well enough, still leaving behind questions about their heritage, and five just proved that the franchise was now solely about the revenue. Doug Bradley (Hellraiser fame) played the leader of the cannibal family, which could have spelled out massive brownie points for horror fans. Unfortunately, after seeing him as Pinhead, he didn't live up to his memorable performance in those films in Wrong Turn 5. His character felt lifeless and had incredibly cheesy dialogue, and served no functional purpose in the film. It seemed as if the producers and directors wanted him to attract attention from horror buffs, bringing in viewers that also brought in the money. Unfortunately, this may have brought in money, but it landed the film the lowest rating of the series on IMDb (4 out of 10). So, sitting down for Wrong Turn 6, I had EXTREMELY low expectations. I didn't want to get my hopes up for something I felt would let me down once again, and I was correct in doing so.
The setting for this film is, as mentioned above, Hobb Springs Resort. It is claimed to be filmed in West Virginia as all of the other films, but the film only takes place there and is actually filmed in Bulgaria. The resort itself is beautiful; It's an endless maze that, if were used correctly, could be a perfect setting for any horror film. It's huge, has vintage collectibles that turn out to be worth some character's lives (literally), and is somewhere I would personally want to stay if it weren't home to homicidal and cannibalistic maniacs.
With that being said, the resort is not used to its full potential. Most of the action takes place in the last half hour of the movie, so the resort feels as if it's a filler for the storyline to be developed. This is a real shame, because it definitely could have been used more to the filmmaker's advantage.
In terms of the two main aspects of these films, blood and gore and sex, one outweighs the other in terms of its frequency. Unfortunately, the latter is in the excess during this film, and in a rather unnecessary use. Within the first five minutes we're presented with a sex scene, and then at least four more acts of sexual contact throughout the film. Out of these acts, only one was crucial to the storyline, and I feel as if the others were there to bring in the attention of males, mostly in Roxanne Pallett's scene where things take a turn for the worse in terms of her and her boyfriend's fates. While I find her attractive, the actual act of sex itself involving her was unnecessary and was most likely there to add some kind of filler.
The gore level in this is movie sadly tame in my opinion. Wrong Turn films have been notorious for laying on the carnage. While there are a handful of deaths, none really made me cringe. In fact, I only found one death even remotely interesting, mostly because it was so ridiculously outlandish and funny. (I'm sure if you watch this film, you'll see which one it is). The other kills in this film are tiring and have all been done before, none really producing any shock value. The upside, however, is that all effects are practical and do not rely on CGI, which made me extremely satisfied and relieved to see a director in this series trying to make the kills more realistic as opposed to computer generated. Perhaps It's the fact that Declan O' Brien finally stepped down from the director's chair after making the third, fourth, and fifth films, which are easily the worst in the series and were the only ones that relied on CGI. For those who are animal lovers, beware: without revealing anything spoiler wise, there is an animal death scene involved in this film that is rather graphic and disturbing. It shows a close up of an animal's eye right before its death, and it can be rather upsetting.
Finally, the acting: I have not one complaint about the acting in this film. Every single actor and actress gives a solid performance, most without getting annoying. The female actresses tend to be kind of bitchy toward other characters, but I believe that's how they were written to be performed. There were very few characters I actually wanted to die, and for the first time in this series, I found myself liking some of the characters and rooting for them to survive. Unfortunately, as I'm sure avid viewers of this series know, not many end up making it out alive. While I was cheering for certain characters to live, I found myself wanting all of the female characters to be slaughtered. That may sound sexist, but they don't bring much to the table and don't seem to have the courage to survive, nor the will. Strong female characters in horror films are rare, however. It seems the only time they are ever strong is during a lead role, and as stated, the main character is Danny. Therefore, the female characters serve no other functional purpose than as sexual beings and future dinner for the cannibals.
All in all, this film is worth a rent, but not a buy. While not memorable, it brings something refreshing and new to the series, relying on practical effects as opposed to CGI as it had been with the past three entries in the series. With another Wrong Turn slated for next year, you'll be hearing from me around the same time in 2015, giving you a review of Wrong Turn 7. Lets hope that one reboots this series even more.

6680034,2,B00NTNY7SQ,Probably the worst one in the wrong turn series and I've seen them all.

6680035,1,B00NTNY7SQ,"With every new Wrong Turn released, a little piece of me dies inside when I insist on watching it and realize half way through that it's even worse than it's predecessor. So disappointing since the first 3 1/2 were pretty entertaining. Throw in some pretty creative, graphic kills and I'm basically satisfied...so how did part 6 go wrong? Barely any creative kills!!! Bow and arrow? An ax? Really?! They focused more on the sad deer getting killed than they did most of the victims in this movie. Also, the makeup was horrible. Instead of looking like natural-born incest ""mutants"", they just looked like they were wearing cheap Halloween masks.  And I'm sorry, but Wrong Turn 6 should have been released on Skinamax since it's really just a soft-core porno. Seemed like sex was more the focus of this movie than the murders were which was a huge disappointment for me. If you want to rub one out please watch this movie, but if you're looking for fun kills similar to the first few Wrong Turns you're outta luck.",1414022400,23,1013,4.691011235955056

6680038,3,B00NTNY7SQ,"The 3 hillbillies team up with another family member, like in the last movie. However things go quite differently than any of the other sequels. I have to say that with this new director, we have a new perspective and a story that is unpredictable. Of course some things are obvious, like people are gonna die. But how it all plays out is quite interesting.
And that's about the sum of the good side of this movie. It is low budget and it shows with things like the make-up. Our 3 freaks are kept mostly at a distance from the camera because they don't look much like they did in previous movies. Some sets are sparse and it looks like the filming was done in an abandoned building. Acting was uneven and accents slipped out every once in a while. Some confusing parts early in the movie had us wondering. Character development was weak. And as others have mentioned, there was more sex than killing in this movie.
So if you're a fan of the series, sure, take a look. If you're buying, save some money and wait for it to hit the $5 bin. It won't take long.
I suspect this will be the last one they make.

For the hardcore fans:
------
There's no time frame given for this movie. Presumably this took place before the first movie since all 3 are alive.
There are no references to other people or places to tie this to any of the other movies.
This story reinforces that the deformations are due to inbreeding and not chemicals, as brought up in the 2nd movie.",1413936000,,1465,4.346715328467154
6680039,2,B00NTNY7SQ,"I saw this movie today for the first time. Here are my thoughts.

This movie was fairly okay. Different to the other sequels of the series. It's more linked to having the main characters in connection with the hilly billies. The gore has dyed down a little. In exchange for porn. It's slightly better then 3, 4 and 5. But still not worth making another sequel.

Director Valeri Milev (Re-Kill) follows the sloppy patterns of his predecessors, opening with a breasty sex scene and a gory murder sequence. And with these death scenes this sequel reintroduces us to our favorite inbred hillbilly cannibals: Three Finger (Radoslav Parvanov; Undisputed 2-3, Wrong Turn 5: Bloodlines), Sawtooth (Danko Jordanov; The Hills Run Red) and One-Eye (Asen Asenov). Unfortunately, they don't look as good as they used to (in terms of make-up quality) and they lack any sense of personality that differentiated them in past franchise installments (e.g., Three Finger was the loony and hyper one whereas now they're all equally off-kilter). Instead theyve been reduced to ugly, mutant hillbilly cannibals 1, 2 and 3.

In this shakily written sequel, a mysterious inheritance brings a twenty-something and his friends to a West Virginia Appalachian resort with a dark history and a weird pair of sibling caretakers. Keeping things classy, this movie boasts more sex scenes than death scenes, a stupidly convoluted plot (much as Texas Chainsaw 3-D) andif were being honestnot quite enough horror. It almost goes into pervy territory with its sexualized storyline and themes (even with respect to the kills). Not that it doesnt have its moments they're just heavily biased towards the final third of the film.

The razor wire death scene is engaging for gorehounds (and a nice call back to part 1), but much of the slashy/stabby gory effects rely on CGI finishing (e.g., an arrow through the head, the beheading). Such has been the case with the last several Wrong Turn sequels. At times I wonder if this is really less expensive than approaching them from a fully practical angle, or if its simply easier to handle these issues in post-production. But at the end of the day, these films continue to entertain me.

We enjoy a brutal leg break and dismemberment, an awesome headwound, the unforgettable anal firehose death scene, and a really weird family reunion reminiscent of Bleeders (1997) or Basket Case 3 (1991).

All in all, this was a moderately satisfying flick for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Certainly not worthy of being main event of the evening, but I got a few chuckles. The writing might be terrible, yet this sequel manages to entertain without much regret.  Youll feel more fun (or tedium) than fear.  But this could make for a great Bad Movie Tuesday if you're looking for some gory laughs.",1531008000,,2575,5.030516431924883
