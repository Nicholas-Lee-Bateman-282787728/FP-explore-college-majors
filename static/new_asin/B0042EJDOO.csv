4249557,3,B0042EJDOO,"A lot of historical inaccuracies mixed with some accurate information.  From the beginning where they show the death of Jefferson it's entirely inaccurate as Jefferson is in an unknown room with just 1 other person while he passes, the room is not Jefferson's at Monticello.  Later they show British Soldiers marching on Monticello, and they show a monocular with the current Monticello in it, Monticello wasn't built until after the revolution(in it's present form).  They also make it a fact that Jefferson fathered children with Sally Hemmings, when the DNA evidence only shows that a Jefferson did, which was more than likely his brother who was around the slaves more than Thomas was.  They also compare him to modern GOP, you can't compare any of the founders to any modern party and there are few similarities.

Overall it's entertaining, and does touch on a few new subjects, just be cautious that there are some inaccuracies.  I was looking for something different.",1347408000,3,974,5.0186335403726705

8413489,1,B0042EJDOO,"This is just an abominable ""documentary"", it's more of a Republican (GOP) propaganda piece.  It completely distorts the real history of Thomas Jefferson by picking and choosing very, very narrow pieces of history to focus on, especially slivers which try and justify George W. Bush's Iraq War.  If you want a good comedy, then fine, watch it, but if you're looking to really learn about Jefferson (one of the most amazing people to ever have lived), then go pick up any biographical BOOK about him.  This doesn't even mention how his democratic ideals were conceived from his childhood upbringing of living around the Indians; nor doesn't spend more than 30 seconds discussing Jefferson's most important accomplishment (in his OWN view) of creating the first public University (University of Virginia). instead it actually focuses mainly on his home-life and absurd claims such as how Jefferson would be supportive of our current neoliberal economic theories by being supportive of the ""free market"".  The History Channel is just an awful place anyone should get any information.  We need to stop watching TV and read more BOOKS!",1421712000,5,1129,5.147540983606557

8413491,5,B0042EJDOO,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.  Thanks for making this section of history available.",1398643200,,367,4.447761194029851
8413492,5,B0042EJDOO,"I really enjoyed this documentary. I came away with a much deeper understanding of Jefferson, the man. He was not a perfect man, but was, perhaps, perfect for that time. The direction was excellent, and the narators and the actors who participated were exceptionally good.",1354060800,5,272,5.066666666666666
