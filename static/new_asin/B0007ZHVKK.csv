8096499,5,B0007ZHVKK,"This is a pretty old video now, produced in 1997.  It features volleyball expert Pat Powers coaching and providing tips on volleyball fundamentals, including serving, passing (bumping), setting, spiking, and blocking.  I have played a lot of volleyball but never at a super competitive level, mostly just pick-up and rec league so I'd never had formal coaching. But I found that Pat's tips were really useful and very easy to understand and practice.  The video is a great way to get some basic pointers and help on the real meat-and-potatoes of volleyball.  I found that after practicing Pat's tips I really did improve my volleyball game a lot.  I'm still rec league level at best but it's nice to be able to properly serve, pass, set, and spike to keep the game flowing.",1351209600,,773,4.7819548872180455
