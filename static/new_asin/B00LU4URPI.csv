6506776,5,B00LU4URPI,Love this idea and Mill Creek did a very good job picking different episodes that could appeal to all. I just wish they made a Play All button on the menu. But that's no biggie. I really hope they will consider doing more of these holiday themed shows.,1413331200,,252,4.270833333333333
6506777,5,B00LU4URPI,"With just over 38 days until Halloween, it is no surprise that studios will be releasing gobs of horror films and Halloween themed DVDs this time of year. Last week, Mill Creek Entertainment released the DVD, titled TV Guide Spotlight: TV's Spookiest Halloween Episodes. The single-disc DVD features 14 episodes from  13 classic television shows.

The episodes are:

Bewitched (Season 4 - Episode 8) - Safe and Sane Halloween

I Dream of Jeannie (Season 3 - Episode 21) - My Master, the Ghost Breaker

The Jeffersons (Season 6 - Episode 4) - Now You See It, Now You Don't Part 1 & 2

Square Pegs (Season 1- Episode 5) - Halloween XII

The Facts of Life (Season 5 - Episode 6) - Halloween

The Cosby Show (Season 2 - Episode 6) - Halloween

Roseanne (Season 2 - Episode 7) - Boo!

Mad About You (Season 2 - Episode 6) - An Unplanned Child

Married With Children (Season 8 - Episode 7) - Take My Wife, Please

NewsRadio (Season 3 - Episode 7) - Halloween

Ned And Stacey (Season 1 - Episode 8) - Halloween Story

3rd Rock From The Sun (Season 3 - Episode 5) - Scaredy Dick

That '70s Show (Season 2 - Episode 5) - Halloween

It is nice to see a Halloween themed DVD being released featuring a variety of television series from the '60s to the '00s. This a great way to introduce the younger generation to these timeless sitcoms. While most of the shows are still being aired in reruns today, a few them, like NewsRadio, Ned and Stacey and Square Pegs, are hard to find. Ned and Stacey only lasted for two seasons in the late '90s, but I have fond memories of watching it, so I had a blast watching the Halloween Story episode. Actually, I enjoyed watching all the episodes on the DVD and I highly recommend it to others.

6506778,5,B00LU4URPI,"My wife owns Roseanne's Trick & Treats DVD and plays it every year... even got my daughter and her friend hooked. When she discovered TV Guide Spotlight on Halloween was coming out, she got excited. She's been waiting for entertainment companies to wise up and follow in Roseanne's footsteps! People love themed sets, especially HALLOWEEN SETS! She has watched this DVD for the last two days and just laughs. It's really good clean fun the whole family can enjoy, together. If you have kids, and are tired of watching the same Halloween cartoons ever year, pick up this DVD. Sure, the shows are old but they're still good t.v.! One caveat, the dvd does not automatically play one episode to the next. After an episode ends, it jumps back to the menu screen, and you have to select the next video. That can be a bit of a pain...",1410998400,20,827,4.557046979865772
6506779,5,B00LU4URPI,"GREAT BARGAIN!
I spent most of my adult life overseas. In the military,
and working world-wide government jobs I can hon-
estly say I never saw ANY of these episodes ---other
than the ROSEANNE episode--- before.

For t-h-a-t reason, alone, this was well-worth the $$ I
spent on it.",1407801600,7,281,4.73469387755102

6506784,5,B00LU4URPI,"There is only one downside to this dvd which is there is not a play all option. That being said I live for holiday specials and this dvd has some great ones thatll make you excited for Halloween. I really hope that they make a second Halloween compilation, perhaps with more sitcoms from the 90s.",1442361600,,296,4.4

6506795,3,B00LU4URPI,These are just Halloween episodes of sitcoms. It is not 'spooky' at all. There are not many older shows in this collection other than Jeannie which is why I am not as happy about it  but it is a good collection.,1421884800,,211,4.146341463414634

8668190,3,B00LU4URPI,"Some of the episodes didn't really capture the spirit of Halloween---they just had the characters attend a Halloween party that interceded with their personal lives. (i.e., The Cosby Show, Ned & Stacey, 3rd Rock From the Sun) That was it.  OTHER episodes, however, were actually very well-done and had a genuine Halloween ""feel"" to it. (I Dream of Jeannie, Roseanne, That 70s Show, Square Pegs) Basically, depends on what you enjoy when watching a show that has Halloween included in it.(I do plan to purchase the Christmas version of this eventually; I'm curious what that one will be like.)",1477699200,4,592,4.97979797979798

8668192,5,B00LU4URPI,"I love this.  For anyone that wants a good laugh for Halloween that all ages can watch, this is great.  My adult children came to visit and couldn't pry themselves away.  I liked it so much that I just ordered the Christmas version.",1448928000,,232,4.348837209302325
