5169211,1,B008LW25GQ,"This is the worst mock nature documentary about dinosaurs ever produced - the animals act like cartoon characters, scientific information is lacking, and the narration is just dreadful. Although viewing Walking with Dinosaurs on VHS is a mistake because you'll never learn what is science and what is speculation, the DVD version at least answered some questions. (Read the book version of Walking with Dinosaurs, too!) Moreover, in WWD, at least the animals act like animals most of the time - maybe too mammalian, true, but still with the seeming restraint and dullness that is part and parcel of the natural world. Life is more full of quiet miracles than noisy spectacles. WWD gave us quiet miracles with the beginnings of flower pollination by insects, the biomechanics of sauropod feeding, the need for Cryptoclidus to collect 'pebbles and grit,' a Leaellynasaura eats her eggs that failed to hatch, the subtle interaction between two Ankylosaurus, and demise of a Postosuchus via an infected wound. In contrast Dinotasia focuses on sensationalism and laughs - a Tyrannosaurus is speared on the horns of a dead Triceratops, a Rahonavis mimics sound for sadistic purposes, two crocodiles collide while trying to catch a young Anhanguera, and the severed tail of a Dinheirosaurus slaps an Allosaurus as he tries to eat it.
I have a second gripe. OK, I'd forgive Dinotasia for attempting to show nature as a violent and perpetual battle (Life is a constant struggle, but consider the competition between trees in a forest - have you ever noticed it?) if they kept all parts of Dinosaur Revolution in this DVD - they don't. Why? I have many complaints about the program, but at least it could have been presented in its entirety.",1352937600,8,1731,4.993079584775087
5169212,5,B008LW25GQ,"This is the movie that the cable series was supposed to be. Don't see it expecting it to be a longer version of the series. It is a different product, a different vision. It is a collection of classic Warner Brothers-inspired cartoons set to story lines that are based on the latest and best available scientific knowledge about dinosaurs. Some of the stories are violent and may be emotionally difficult for very young children, others show complex and rewarding family universality. At least one is a glorious, funny, nearly shot-for-shot homage to a very classic WB cartoon familiar to any baby boomer. Since Mel Blanc is no longer with us, Dinotasia's animals do not speak words, although they can and do communicate throughout this intelligent and courageous show of visual storytelling. But wait! Mel may be gone, but nothing can prepare you for what happens when Werner Herzog apparently wanders around the production office for a couple of days. In his distinctive vocal style that is both as serious as a heart attack and as winking as your crazy old uncle who understands you're as unique as he, Herzog bridges the stories and lets us know that learning is fun. Again, what Dinotasia is not: it is not a billion dollar James Cameron/Martin Scorsese/Tim Burton re-invention of animated cinematic Art. But director Erik Nelson shows it could have been. It is an inspired, creative, modestly-budgeted success, particularly appealing to those of us who, in words from ""Network,"" ""learned life from Bugs Bunny.""",1352160000,5,1516,5.01984126984127
5169213,4,B008LW25GQ,"This DVD is still worth getting, no doubt. Compared to Dinosaur Revolution, it leaves out quite a bit and jumbles up the story lines, often placing scenes out of context (where they made sense and followed a clear narrative in Dinosaur Revolution).
The scenes not included are : The Cryolophosaurus, the Mosasaur, the Gigantoraptor and the Eoraptor. The one bonus is you get a brief scene at the beginning where an Acrocathosaurus is brought to life from a skeleton and wanders out of the museum into a modern day city. My recommendation is buy it if you cannot get dinosaur revolution on DVD or Blu-Ray, or if you simply are willing to spend whatever it takes even for a brief glimpse of Acrocanthosaurus. For those of you already owning Dinosaur Revolution, this reshuffled and edited version will not add to what you already have witnessed (Acro aside). Overall, I thought Dinosaur Revolution was a better production.",1351641600,15,920,4.903846153846154

5169217,5,B008LW25GQ,"This film, an original film made about the dinosaur eras, has a great film maker's unique perspective and provides another viewpoint to go along with the great BBC specials on dinosaurs. It is a wonderful show and my highest recommendation. It is very hard to find something new and original about dinosaurs. This film succeeds in that.",1471046400,,336,4.912280701754386
5169218,5,B008LW25GQ,"I highly enjoyed Dinotasia. The animation was well done and the dinosaurs were very unique with their colors and patterns. I will say, it is definitely the most violent and graphic, if not sometimes disturbing animated dinosaur show I've ever seen, so parents may want to proceed with caution before letting young kids watch it.",1467417600,,328,4.9818181818181815

5169222,2,B008LW25GQ,"I found this movie on Netflix last night, and, being a dinosaur fanatic, I decided to watch it. I was very impressed, and very disappointed. I will give discovery channel credit, the CGI is the best out of any of their documentaries. Way better than When Dinosaurs Roamed America, and even better than Walking With Dinosaurs. I will also give them credit for showing dinosaurs probably never showed on screen before. The first segment in West Portugal showed a Lourinhanosaurus and a Dinheirisaurus. Other interesting dinosaurs were Shunosaurus, Rapetosaurus, Variraptor, Mirigaia, or Efrassia. That being said, the movie was a major letdown. first of all, the movie was the goriest dinosaur feature I have ever seen. The opening scene summed it up with two Gorgonops fighting over a carcass in a volcanic wasteland. I half expected Frodo and Gollum to come up and throw the One Ring in Mount Doom. The movie had one violent scene after another, from a horrible scene where a Dinheriosaurus slams its tail into a baby Lourinhanosaur, and cracks its face open. It survives however with a deformed jaw. a Tyrannosaurus dies when its neck gets speared by a Triceratops horn, blood goes absolutely everywhere. If you are watching with a small child, expect him or her to run to your bed the night after watching crying after terrifying nightmares. The dinosaurs are also never given animalistic traits. They all act like humans in dinosaur bodies as one reviewer put it. In Walking With Dinosaurs, we see an Allosaurus chasing a Diplodocus not for revenge, or for the heck of it, but because its animal instinct told it ""You're hungry. Eat something."" In Dinotasia a pair of Velociraptor bring down a Protoceratops female. But instead of doing what an animal would do and eat it, they decide to then chase after the baby Protoceratops. An animal would never do that. The moral of the film was, ""Dinosaurs were very emotional creatures that held grudges, chased small prey after killing the mother load, survived mass extinctions and then froze solid, died catching mice, chucked their babies down cliffs, and ripped each other to shreds. The comedy in the movie isn't comedy at all. The first scene shows a mother Lourinhanosaurus being moken up by a screeching small Theropod. it then walks over, and beheads the thing, which then runs around, headless, before falling to the ground gushing blood and twitching. the sad part is that the movie almost expects you to laugh at it. Sorry, but that isn't funny to me or anybody else. Narraration was given by Werner Herzog, very dry boring satire, which added nothing to the film. There are no facts while the movie is going on, no science, just dry descriptions about actors on the timeless stage of life and blah, blah, blah! You've gotta be absolute dinosaur freak like me to fully enjoy the movie, as there are no names given to what dinosaurs you are looking at. and since they added exotic dinosaurs, some more casual dinosaur fans would be scratching their heads trying to figure out what dinos they're looking at.
All in all, it was a disappointing movie that gives you no facts, no info, just a Disney-like look at creatures that really did exist.

P.S. T-rex females were larger than males, and what the heck were those giant frogs anyway?!",1442361600,2,3292,4.847246891651865

5169225,2,B008LW25GQ,"There's no way in h*ll that ANY baby carnivore could survive to adulthood with a shattered jaw! Especially if mom just walks away! Also, female T Rex's are LARGER than the males!  Didn't know that, did you? Look it up. And the biggest mistake of all was to add the segment ""FORBIDDEN FRUIT""!!! I imagine the targeted audience of this DVD would be children? Most aren't going to understand what was wrong with eating the mushrooms! And how are Mom and Dad going to explain it? A subject I don't think most parents would address until their kids are about preteen age. A STUPID decision just for the sake of trying to be funny, and it's not! I also think the ""human characteristics"" imposed onto most of the dinosaurs missed the mark too. It just made 'Dinotasia' less realistic to the point of being silly sometimes; and thus less enjoyable, as I enjoy learning ""facts"" about dinosaurs and other educational subjects..not fiction!

P.S. Being outside is COLDER than being inside!!!",1431388800,,980,4.758823529411765
5169226,4,B008LW25GQ,I first saw this movie in a science museum in Arizona. I sat and watched the entire movie. Then I went home and found it online and purchased it along with a couple of other dinosaur movies. Dinosaurs are big in our house even among the adults.,1426809600,,244,4.212765957446808
5169227,2,B008LW25GQ,"I like Dinotasia only as a means to own SOME of the glorious footage of Dinosaur Revolution. This is a very stripped down, and in my opinion, dumbed down version of Dinosaur Revolution. What I fail to understand is... Why, oh Why, has the full Dinosaur Revolution not been released on DVD or Blu Ray in the USA? According to it's own promotional material, IT'S an American production! So why is it NOT available in America?

Instead, here in America, we get the extremely shortened, and far less interesting,  Dinotasia!

QUIT STATING THAT ""DINOTASIA"" iIS THE SAME AS ""DINOSAUR REVOLUTION""!

I have been waiting over 3 years now for Dinosaur Revolution to be able to be purchased!

For those who have not seen Dinosaur Revolution, you have no means of comparison, and you will probably enjoy Dinotasia. But for those of you who have seen Dinosaur Revolution, don't be fooled by this scaled down, watered down version.",1420675200,7,917,4.8152866242038215

5169231,5,B008LW25GQ,This is a great film! To have Werner Herzog narrate such a silly film is perfect! One of the best parts is when a Dinosaur eats some psychedelic mushrooms and goes on a bad trip. Highly recommended if you like weird films to show your friends. Lots of poop and violence as well.,1404864000,,278,4.264150943396227

5169233,1,B008LW25GQ,Unless your showing this to a 2 yr old. I didn't learn much from it just a lot of speculation on dino feelings. Very interesting.,1403740800,3,129,4.2
5169234,5,B008LW25GQ,This movie is a must see for adult dinosaur lovers. It is not a kid's movie by any stretch of the imagination since it depicts the struggle for survival in an unvarnished fashion. That means it includes violence and some gore. It wouldn't be accurate if it didn't. People who are familiar with Werner Herzog have come to expect excellence; this movie is no different.,1390867200,,367,4.661538461538462
5169235,5,B008LW25GQ,"Grabbed this at a Barnes & Noble near my house. I'll be honest: I didn't expect to get what basically amounts to the original vision of ""Dinosaur Revolution"" - as in little if any narration, in this case provided by legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog - check the show's page on tvtropes.org if you doubt my word.

In the same manner as DR, Dinotasia combines the latest scientific evidence - including the small feathered theropods - with stories crafted in a purely visual style that hasn't been seen since the classic era of silent cinema - again, as the show was originally intended, before the Discovery Channel's executives changed it.

And to any parents reading this review and intending to buy this DVD for your kid(s), a little advance warning - and maamaakrystal, I'm looking at you - : If you were expecting something like ""The Land Before Time"", what you need to understand is that the dinosaurs in this movie (and their predecessors, contemporaries and successors) were fighting for survival in a world every bit as violent and unforgiving as ours is today - the broken jaw suffered by the male Allosaurus europaeus in the Late Jurassic Portugal segment is proof enough because it was based on a real specimen.

Just like the Walking With... series, the animals are modeled and animated in a computer then dropped into a real-life backdrop that reflects what the world looked like when the creatures in each segment were alive - although in the complete Late Jurassic Portugal segment (included as a bonus extended scene) I distinctly remember seeing a palmetto tree.

The scientific accuracy - nothing short of astounding: the theropod hands aren't pronated (a.k.a. held like a kangaroo), most of the coelurosaurs - including the newly-hatched baby Tyrannosaurus rex - are well-feathered (I'm letting the Ornitholestes slide because the jury is still out on its phylogenetic position), the Triceratops skin is even based on an unpublished specimen examined by the show's creators, the Troodon are properly shown to be omnivores and the males are responsible for looking after the eggs, the hands on the Majungasaurus (the abelisaurid from Madagascar) and the sauropods are correctly modeled, the common meme of having female theropods larger than the males is avoided, and the juvenile pachycephalosaur in the Hell Creek segment isn't intended to be any particular genus in order to avoid the whole ontogenetic debate (and because the model was going to be used for Prenocephale) - and it turns out that the only way a T. rex could've been killed by a Triceratops is if it was shoved onto the carcass's eyebrow horn, and in this case, right through the neck (Ouch).

As Variety Magazine said, Dinotasia ""owes as much to [Disney's] FANTASIA as it does to WALKING WITH DINOSAURS"" - and I certainly agree.

Again, if you want to get this for your kid, I urge you to seriously re-consider your choice.",1384041600,6,2910,4.940695296523518
5169236,5,B008LW25GQ,"The short stories about life back in the age of dinosaurs is a must have for anyone who loves dinosaurs.  The information is current, the dinsaurs look updated and modern and the CGI...wow!  Near Jurrasic Park quality CGI.  So this is dinosaur eyecandy at it's best.  The portrail of the dinsasaurs is well thought out.  They made them into living breathing animals by showing them doing things such as scratching and itch, shaking thier heads (a fly maybe?) and other actions we see animals do all the time today.  They also injected a bit of humor in the story buy having the dinsaurs act out in an almost human faction with emotion and whit.  (I won't spoil it for you, but the scene with the dinsaur making noise keeping the other dinsaur awake had us laughing)
I only wish such a good disc would have more special features.",1373328000,,828,4.554054054054054
5169237,1,B008LW25GQ,"You'd think that with a name Dinotasia (like Fantasia), this would be appropriate for children.  I must research documentaries better before showing them to my 7 year old.  We watched for 5 minutes, watched anthropamorphized dinosaurs kill each other at every move and then I had to turn it off to comfort my distraught child as he cried for 10 minutes.  Little scientific basis to boot.  Animation was great though.",1372291200,5,416,4.9
5169238,5,B008LW25GQ,Very cool movie (yes movie). It is a great movie despite the lack of a narrator which is why I say movie and not documentary. There is gore (not too bad though) so young children might not be okay to watch it.,1367366400,,209,4.0
5169239,5,B008LW25GQ,I love this movie because of the dinosaur with the broken jaw (in the watering hole). Its from dinosaur revolutions. Dinotasia is a shorter version of dinosaur revolutions. Must have if you can't get dinosaurs revolutions. Five stars!!,1366416000,,235,5.2105263157894735

5169242,2,B008LW25GQ,"I was curious weather this was a new extended episode of ""Dinosaur Revolution"", or if this was somehow all four episodes eviscerated down into less then an hour and a half of video. Considering I wanted to watch the Documentary ""Dinosaur Revolution"", not some fantasy remix of existing CGI, I am not impressed.

I am exceptionally disappointed with what I just watched, there was almost no narration at all to describe what creatures I was looking at. There was no presentation of the fossil evidence to back up the what was presented in the CGI. There was nothing other then the CGI after the title screen, This is NOT a Documentary about dinosaurs, it is a retread of a small portion of CGI from ""Dinosaur Revolution"" with everything else removed from the video. The CGI from ""Dinosaur Revolution"" really was good, otherwise this would be a 1-star (I hate it) video.

I was really hoping for something akin to a continuation of ""The Truth About Killer Dinosaurs"" with Bill Oddie. Apparently presenting the evidence to back up the claims being made in these films is just not done anymore. That is truly tragic.",1362096000,3,1112,4.756476683937824

5169244,5,B008LW25GQ,"We have the blu-ray version of this DVD; it is excellent.  This, refreshingly, is one of the more modern DVDs on dinosaurs; a lot of the older films and DVDs have outdated images and erroneous depictions (based on current findings).  This DVD depicts the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous life as if you were somehow transported there to see things for yourself! The CGI is done pretty nicely and the dinosaur life forms seem realistic enough.  I would have liked to see a bit more of some degree of feathering on the T-rex dinosaurs and on the Allosaurs (as they probably had more than the film depicts) but at least the younger T-rex did have some semblance of feathering... and (correctly and admirably) had a longer and narrower skull/jaw configuration (which did gradually change during the maturation process into what the grizzly adults looked like)! This DVD lacks a lot of human commentary; but, in this case, it is (in a big way) a blessing; it puts you more in the ""here and now"" of the Mesozoic times (as if you actually were there).  All in all, a very enjoyable dino flick.  My wife and I have a lot of dinosaur books and have just about every dinosaur movie that exists. This one is more than enjoyable... and one which we will watch multiple times! Some of the bonus sections are lengthy and excellent extensions!
