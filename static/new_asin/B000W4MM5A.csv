8440840,1,B000W4MM5A,"Buyer beware!  The length of the DVD is not provided in the product description.  Upon receipt I was shocked to read on the back of the package that it would run approximately 10 minutes! For $14.95!!!  Now I am returning three unopened DVD's (Graz, Wachau & Hallstatt) because a total price of $44.85 for less than 30 minutes is robbery.",1197676800,3,338,4.6
