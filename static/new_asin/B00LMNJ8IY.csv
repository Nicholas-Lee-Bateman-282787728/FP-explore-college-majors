Although the screenplay was inspired by a true story, the movie was never intended to retell the original series of events.  For those who criticize the movie for not retelling the events as they actually occurred, I say, Get over it.  Some of the best fiction from ancient times to the present has been similarly inspired by actual events but constructed around a plot uniquely its own.  I found the plot spellbinding and the acting superb!",1412899200,,502,4.724137931034483
