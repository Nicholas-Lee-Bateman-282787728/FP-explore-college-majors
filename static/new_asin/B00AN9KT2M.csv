8554560,5,B00AN9KT2M,"I used to take this out of the library on 16mm film (they would loan the projector also) and have long wanted to see it on home video (though it turns out it was on VHS as early as 1988). This is a haunting and atmospheric depiction of the Nathaniel Hawthorne short story and runs about half an hour. Interesting music and special effects. A rare and unusual item. From 1972. Recommended. Note: Maggie McOmie who plays Faith, the wife of Goodman Brown, had appeared about two years earlier in George Lucas` sci-fi piece THX 1138. In that film she, like every other actor, had her head shaved. Her hair sure grew back quick ! Also, she appeared briefly in her birthday suit then, but here she is cloaked in heavy puritanical wardrobe. Finally, though the original Hawthorne story is of course based in Salem, MA the film was made in California so the scenery is a bit different. -- There is an interesting article on the making of this little film in the March 1973 issue of American Cinematographer magazine. I found a copy on eBay.",1359676800,3,1032,4.524064171122995
