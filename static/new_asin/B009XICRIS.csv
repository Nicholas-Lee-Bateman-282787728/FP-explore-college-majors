5371210,5,B009XICRIS,you not only feel for the little girl and what she went through but also that of those around her even the father who left her at the orphange. its also a great movie to stir couples up to adopt.,1365984000,,195,3.9
5371211,5,B009XICRIS,"I watched this movie, first, because it starred Sae-ron Kim who I had seen in ""The Man from Nowhere."" I had fallen in love with her in that movie and wanted to see if she had been in any others.

In this, probably her first movie, she plays a young girl whose father abandons her to an orphanage. It is never explained why he gave her up although she assumes it is because her little brother was once injured while in her care.

The movie is haunting. Although she is mainly silent and rarely says anything you can palpably feel her excruciating pain as she slowly comes to terms with her new life. She has one good friend that seems to understand her and truly cares for her, Sookhee, played by another wonderful young actress, Do Yeon Park. Unfortunately this too leads to pain in the end.

I liked the counterpoints in this movie.  The Catholic orphanage she has been placed in is full of wonderful, caring nuns, and friendly children, but the counterpoint is that although there is some healing in that, it still can't remove all the pain of her abandonment.

I loved the way the movie was filmed almost entirely from her short height. You couldn't help but identify with this little person, seeing the world around her through her own eyes.

The ending was bittersweet, both sad and full of hope.  I believe the movie was inspired by the director and writer's own life (Ounie Lecompte), who was given up for adoption at 9 years of age and adopted by a French family.

Truly a film worth watching and ""feeling.""",1363737600,6,1515,4.5036496350364965
5371212,5,B009XICRIS,"The child actors in this movie should get Oscars:-)

While the story is reminiscent of other tales of abandoned children and orphans, whether autobiographical or literary fiction, it's filmed in a more realistic style. There isn't a fairy tale ending, girls who are pretty and smart can hope to find adoptive parents, others have limited choices. But it's beautifully paced and filmed and doesn't use cheap tricks to try to evoke a response. Probably not most peple's idea of a date night flick but rewarding in its own way.",1363737600,22,524,4.887640449438202

5371214,5,B009XICRIS,The pain in life can start early for any human being and this movie shows it. I am an 50+ year old man and it brought me to tears... Anyone watching this will understand great sorrow and great redemption.,1355443200,,204,4.256410256410256
5371215,5,B009XICRIS,"Here I am, a 47 year old man with tears streaming down his face after having just finished watching what is easily one of the top 3 movies I have ever watched in my lifetime.  I watched this movie on Roku on the ADC channel. The little ads, strategically placed in the best parts of the movie, were a bit annoying, but not nearly enough to keep me riveted to my seat. This little girls performance is unlike anything I have ever seen out of a child actor.  Not to mention out of an adult actor. I don't want to say too much to spoil the movie, but you actually feel the heartbreak that this little girl feels after her father abandons her at an orphanage. She was enamored with her father and for him to do that was the ultimate in devastation for her. The movie has alot of hope, only to be followed by letdown, followed again by hope. I hope everyone who reads this has the opportunity to watch this movie.  5 stars does not do it justice. Please watch it.  And please leave a review.  Amazing!",1351382400,38,996,4.221052631578948
5371216,5,B009XICRIS,"One day recently, I was trolling through the tv channels, looking for something to watch. I came across this movie which was just seconds into its beginning. At that moment, I had no idea of what it was about or what it had in store for me. As I continued to watch this movie (thankfully, with English subtitles), I became deeply engrossed in what was unfolding before my eyes.
It soon became obvious to me that this movie was going to be one of the very best ever to be seen by my eyes. The abandonment of this beautiful little girl by her father, who lied to her, was soon to bring tears to these 73 year old eyes. The torment that she had to go through,forcibly having to live in an all girl orphanage, with many other young girls and the way she handles her situation, had me completly engrossed in this movie. When she was finally accepted for adoption by a French couple, it left me further wondering, just what her brand new life was going to bring her. A new family, a new mother, a new father, a new country, a new language, new house rules, new food.....everything that would be completely alien to her. Those things kept me asking myself, how will she make out, will she make it? She is clearly a very sad, yet a very intelligent little girl. Being abandoned by her father had brought the whole world upon her shoulders. We find out that her father, whom she loved very much, abandoned her, moved away from their home, to live with another woman.....their where-abouts unknown.
I won't say anything more about this movie other than you really should buy this movie and I sincerely say that you will be very glad that you did.
On the other hand, I have to add this to my story. Having seen the movie on my tv, when it finished, I went straight to this computer and checked if Amazon had it. They did. So I ordered it immediately. A week later, I discovered the movie on ""catch-up tv"".So, I was able to watch it a second time (and again and again, if I had wanted to).
Eventually, my dvd arrived, via Thailand. Two nights later, I had the time to watch it. Eagerly, I put it into my dvd player. According to the information on the packaging, it was 90 minutes (approx) long. At 0ne hour and ten minutes, it began freezing momentarily and progressively, getting worse. To make matters even more worse, it was now being contaminated with pixilation which also continued to worsen. At 1.17 it was not possible to play it any further. Needless to say, I was more than a little angry at this disaster. I tried playing the disc on every one of my 13 dvd players.....all incurred the same problem.
More than a little annoyed now, I immediately contacted the dealer in Thailand about this situation. I was delighted to get his reply.....within an hour!!!He appologised and promised to immediately send a free replacement disc. This he has apparently done, but at this time of writing, it has not yet arrived, no doubt due to the busy Xmas deliveries. I expect its arrival early January.
I am very dismayed that my anxious wait for its arrival was marred by its poor disc production.
I am hopeful that my replacement copy will bring happier results. We shall see.
But, apart from this, it is truly a wonderful movie and I strongly urge you to buy, borrow, or beg to see it. Trully, you'll be glad you did.",1324771200,22,3305,4.446457990115321
5371217,5,B009XICRIS,"I saw Kim Saeron in the Man From Nowhere .  Her performance was superior.  Again in this film she is outstanding.  All the characters in this film are very strong.  You care deeply about them. Beautiful story.  The director and writer put together an excellent, well developed story. I strongly recommend this film.",1316131200,14,315,4.867924528301887
5371218,5,B009XICRIS,"The director herself is an orphan from Korea.  What really moved me about this movie is that the little girl who smiles so happily at the beginning of the movie as her father takes her out to the market for new shoes and dinner won't be smiling again for the rest of the movie because she knows that she's being abandoned and she's doing everything in her power to suppress her sadness, anger, fear and confusion from being abandoned by the very person who should love her the most.

I hope Amazon makes this movie more available.  This movie deserves 5 stars for its quiet beauty that tells the story of a very brave, little girl who struggles and comes to terms with her life.......at a very early age.  I doubt that many of us can handle such harsh reality as bravely and strongly as this little girl does in the movie.  Simply amazing performance by Kim Sae-Ron.  She displayed more composure, courage, strength and maturity than most ""professional"" actors I've seen in a very long time.",1299542400,44,991,4.570621468926554
5371219,5,B009XICRIS,"Here, orphanage life is so differently portrayed from the usual western Dickens/L.O.Annie/Little Princess take on it...  the orphanage conditions were meager but not unkind.  The children showed some ostracization initially to the to new inmate but were not hopelessly mean.  Most different was the inner-life of the orphan protagonist... dismayed and confused with her abandonment, she withdrew into herself; even to the extent of burying herself, as if dead.  Hardly the plucky, dancing orphan portrayed by Hollywood!

How close to the experience of the Korean-born, once orphaned director, we do not know.  But, the child's bewilderment, frustration and incomprehension of it all were very believable.  As true too were the details of the conditions of the orphanage, its institutional staffing, each with their own hinted at but unexplained emotional lives, made this a full and complex storyline.

Its believability and emotional pathos so well-crafted and presented makes this a very special film.",1500422400,3,1003,5.552631578947368

Jinhee struggles to adjust, hopeful of her father's return. The acting and pace of the movie are what truly bring it to life. Often times with films like this they tend to be slow moving or attempt to grab the attention of the audience, falling short in doing so, but this particular movie did rather well in these aspects.

5371239,5,B009XICRIS,"This is one of the most heartrending movies I've ever seen. Abandoned by her father whom she idolized, an 8-year old S.Korean girl is sent to an orphanage in Seoul run by Catholic nuns. The film details her difficulties of adjustment. Eventually, she accepts her new fate. Directed by Ounie Lecomte, the little girl gives an extraordinary performance. Aided by a lovely face full of expression, she mesmerized me. The movie is worth seeing just for her.
SPOIL ALERT: The little S. Korean girl gets adopted by a French couple and flies alone to Paris, and meets her adopted parents. While the  film ends in a rather sad dream scene of her riding a bike behind her father, we can extrapolate the rest of her life from that of the filmmaker, Ounie Lecomte herself. Born in S. Korea in 1966, she too was left at a Catholic orphanage in Seoul, and, at age 9, got adopted by a French protestant minister and his wife. She studied dress design and used her skills in films. She also acted in a number of these. In one of her trips to S. Korea she got to meet her biological parents.",1476316800,4,1075,4.456852791878172

I felt completely, powerfully drawn into the movie without feeling emotionally manipulated or exhausted.  Everything about this movie is quiet, understated, complex, and absolutely heartbreakingly human.  There are so many little seemingly mundane or insignificant things that all added together make this movie just an absolute perfection.

Unfortunately, situations like this were way too common in Korea, and the majority of abandoned children were inevitably female. Which led me to wonder whether the orphanage was for all-girls or all the children just happened to be girls. If anything, this movie really drives home the point of how devastating abandonment of a child by their parent(s) is, considering their helplessness and how completely dependent they are on the adults who care for them.",1451520000,,620,5.029126213592233

5371271,4,B009XICRIS,I have an interest in almost everything Korean.  Korean history is very sad and this is a sad story. I had to watch a Korean comedy after this movie  to neutralize this sad story.  Making a movie with primarily children is very difficult and this is well done.

5371272,5,B009XICRIS,"I've often seen portrayals of Western families adopting an Asian child, but what does the process look like from the child's point of view? The little girl in this movie is no orphan, but a motherless child whose father pretends that they're going on a fun outing and then abandons her at a Catholic orphanage for girls without even saying good-bye. She keeps hoping that he will come back for her, but when it becomes obvious that he has no such intention, she then aspires to be one of the lucky ones who is chosen for adoption. The director, who herself was adopted from Korea to France, gives us a vivid portrayal of life inside the orphanage and the friendships and rivalries among the girls, as well as the poignant situation of the older girls, who are unlikely ever to be adopted. It's one of those movies with moments that you won't forget.",1440806400,,849,4.555555555555555

5371274,5,B009XICRIS,"The artistic aspect of this movie is off the charts. It is a visual feast.

It also give incredible insight into the vast and subtle cultural differences within Eastern and Western minds.

I have heard that Asian children adopted as infants into Western families tend to have deep issues with self-worth and connections if they grow up in an area where they are the only Asian or one of few; especially if the family is unable to connect the child with their heritage due to lack of resources or understanding.

After watching this movie I started to wonder how much harder it might be for an older child who is adopted. Their brain is already being wired for language, behavioral, and thought patterns that are so different from a Western approach.

I understand that love can bridge many gaps, but parents and children in the adoptive process have so many expectations. Adults, especially first time parents, may not be prepared. Parenthood like marriage takes work. Marriage and parenthood are wonderful, but are definitely not lived out in fairy tale conditions.

Even parents of biological children get a bit of a wake-up call as their child traverses the road to adulthood and often stands in opposition to them. I can only imagine how confusing it must be for adoptive parents when they are blessed by a child with a well-formed sense of self from a culture they do not understand.

So it becomes not just parent-child misunderstandings and tension but a deep cultural aspect adds a very confusing layer of mystery.

I know that some people are up to the task, but I hope that adoption agencies are really and truly preparing parents because the children have so little choice in the matter. We owe it to the children we so desperately want to love.

These are all the thoughts that have been brewing in my mind after watching this movie and none of these topics were blatantly addressed. It is a movie that causes you to question and think without telling you what to think or what conclusions to draw.

Please note, you never see Jinhee with her adoptive family. ""A Brand New Life"" leaves the viewer with many thoughts of what her ""brand new life"" will be. Instead of thinking about the happy family you think about what the child will be facing in a place where her struggles may be incomprehensible to those who want to love her.",1440547200,2,2340,4.68780487804878

Honestly, even if the story isn't your style, you have to give her huge credit for her rendition of this very emotionally challenging role. It never--and I mean never--feels forced or disingenuous.

This movie, for the most part, is subtle in how it presents its main themes and symbolism.

We see this child getting overlooked several times throughout the film, and as she is being rejected I am wondering just what is going through her mind. How is she feeling about being rejected? As you can see the child does a marvelous job in portraying this rejection on film. What make matters even worse is the few orphans that she had befriended, but then in a short while, she sees them being picked up by families and again leaving her behind.

Looking at the film's background it appears that this film may be an autobiographic glimpse of the director's childhood who was an orphan and she, like this sweet little girl in the film, finally gets a family and spends the rest of her childhood in France. This is truly a heartwarming story and I am sure you will really like this little girl's performance in making this movie for what it is--a great film.",1412380800,,1103,4.46039603960396

5371303,4,B009XICRIS,"It must be hard enough for any child who loses their parents prematurely through no fault of their own. I can't even imagine what it must be like to be a child abandoned at an orphanage by a living father. No doubt the father has troubles and believes he is doing what's best for his daughter; one of the brilliant points of the film is to never share with us the actual motivation. We are just as in the dark as the daughter, Jinhee.

Indeed, the entire movie, while conventionally shot in the third-person, is really all about Jinhee's viewpoint. We learn practically nothing that she does not observe directly, and it cements the idea that this story is hers and hers alone. Even as events occur to others at the orphanage, we witness them from Jinhee's perspective and understanding (or in some cases, lack thereof).

In some sense, the plot is very basic: first, Jinhee is with her father. Then she's not, but she's at the orphanage. Then finally, she's somewhere else. I'm not sure it's really about ""coming of age"" -- the entire story seems to take place within a single year of her pre-pubescent life. But Jinhee certainly learns things about life and herself that most children her age might never have cause or opportunity to learn. Seeing Jinhee suffer with her inner conflict, attempting to resolve it in a variety of ways, and finally learning how, is the kind of character growth that makes for compelling story-telling.",1411603200,2,1434,4.709163346613546

5371309,5,B009XICRIS,"The Korean title says ""a traveler/Journeyman ."" And the original title is translated as ""Une vie toute neuve/ a brand new life"".

The story starts in the year 1975, from the under-toned, very well-depicted era of South Korea. when S. Koreans were still going through the decades of poverty and ignorance from the hard life and fear of the socialistic Militant government ruling was prevalent.
Although this social aspect was not explained to the audience directly, the gray winter tone of the filim and the careful setting of the remote and ""claustrophobic"" orphanage world actually depicts the dreary and naivete of everyday life. But, it was a safety zone for those little ones.

The movie itself could be treated as a story of the dramatic changing life of the poor man's daughter, Jinhee (Kim, Sae-ron, she was only 9 to play her role!) and through her vulnerable yet naive eyes, how her disconnection from her deserting father is formed into trust and bravery to fly out to see the new step parents in the West. Ironically, the two girls with butter cakes are the innocent symbol of the better life.  and ""Hello"" ""Thank you"" would be the representation of the anticipation for the glorious USA to the poor girls. That was the admiration of the society. The social setting was almost as accurate as one can remember of that time.

Dreary. fearful, Not much to dream of, but very innocent at the same time.

I highly praise the distance of the spectator to the story. The direction was successfully executed to allow us to contemplate the society and the morality of that 70s in S. Korea as a current witness. Without showing cheap pity or melodrama.

Through the temporarily-bounded unity of the extended family with other young girls, Jinhee learned to conform to her uncertaity like everyone else to accept the ""better"" life somewhere else, which was the only optimistic choice left by then. Heart-breaking. But, it was never been clearly addressed. But throughout the movie, I thought of the frailty of the life.

 At least, the Korean adoptee-director, Ounie Lecomte, herself, found a right choice to work with Lee, Chang-dong, (producer) who is known to have the mastery of this contemplative Distance in his film directing, And, the story is presented quietly yet powerfully.

This is a very original purifying experience.  and a very sensitive hidden gem I would recommend to the world I cherish.. I hope you pass along the same sentiment next.",1405814400,,2455,4.893975903614458

She leans on her newly acquired friends, to only discover that life of the adults is still able to take control of hers, to hurt her once more. I was totally absorbed by the very realistic performance not only of this kid, but also of the others in the orphanage.

Although a doctor in the movie states the reason why the father did this, we are never left with a true understanding of why.  But the focus of the movie is not on why, but rather how she deals with it.  As a father of two young girls, I found myself constantly upset while watching this movie because I would never give up my kids no matter how bad my situation was.  I felt so much sorrow for the young girl, who must not only deal with her new life in the orphanage, but will forever feel betrayed and brokenhearted that her father left her there without any explanation as to why.  She is left to ponder and come to that conclusion on her own.  I always find it hard to watch children suffer in movies, let alone real life.  The fact is that many Koreans have been given up for adoption, and I have met several while living in Korea who were all returning to Korea to find/meet their biological mothers and/or fathers.  Anyway, the kid actors do a good job.  This is a simple, low-budget flick written and directed (I think) by an adoptee.",1395014400,,1227,4.2956521739130435

5371346,5,B009XICRIS,"take you all for the ride of a small girl whose father drops her off at an orphanage because he can't afford her, since he married another woman and had a baby. The small actress does amazing acting. Kind of a simple film.",1370649600,,222,4.186046511627907
5371347,4,B009XICRIS,I chose four stars because I genuinely liked this movie. It brought me to the point in my life when i was the same age and I can only imagine the emotions and fear that would follow being dropped off at an orphanage by a parent you thought adored you.,1370649600,,251,4.04

8545086,5,B009XICRIS,"Having personal experience with Korean adoption, this movie was truly heart breaking and also shed light on the trauma some of my family members must have experienced before being adopted. Adoption is so complex and many families in Korea had no options, or wanted to give their children better lives in the West, without thinking of the emotional implications. Acting was superb. And the subtitles were spot on.",1517097600,,412,5.073529411764706
8545087,5,B009XICRIS,"Please consider adopting a orphan if you can.  Those kids will learn to love more and gain more wisdom from their life experiences. They will be so grateful if they have the second chance to have a happy family again.  I sponsored a child in Kenya through a non-profit called ""Compassion International"". With a small monthly fee, I can make a great impact on a poor child's life.  It can change their destiny. God bless us All!",1516579200,,427,4.51948051948052
8545088,5,B009XICRIS,"As a father to a single daughter, I found this movie extremely sad and difficult to watch, only because the acting is so amazing and realistic, and the real and authentic ordeal and sorrow that these young orphans are put through is really heart breaking and powerful. The little girls/actresses in this movie, especially the girl who played the lead, did a phenomenal job of making this movie seem actually not a movie, but real, like a biographical piece. The really sad part is that the director of this movie actually lived this an an orphan as did many other children and continues even today. Highly recommended for everyone in the family to watch, something for all ages to watch and learn from.",1516060800,2,702,4.715447154471545

8545091,4,B009XICRIS,"This quality film is based on the actual life experience of French-Korean filmmaker Ounie Lecomte.  From passenger on her dads bike, snuggled up adoringly, her joyful face pressed against his back, to being dropped off summarily, without a word, at an orphanage, this childs story is majorly impactful. Young Sae-ron Kim is impressive in the lead, the whole cast solid.  A weighty and worthy film.",1509753600,,397,5.092307692307692
8545092,5,B009XICRIS,"You know from the premise that this one will tug at the heartstrings.  However, the performances of the child actors were so transparent, so in the moment, that I was swept in to a deeper level of feeling, of connection.

This was not a story I merely saw with my eyes or heard through my ears.  I felt it in my heart.

I'm going to wait a little while, but I'll be watching this again. And again.  It's a place of honesty.",1506902400,,423,4.109756097560975
8545093,5,B009XICRIS,"Not since I saw Dr. Zhivago, when the child Yuri lost his mother, have I seen a movie that captured childhood loss so brilliantly.  This movie is very sad and slow-paced, yet it is about real and stark emotion -- a rare gem.",1506729600,,224,4.209302325581396
8545094,2,B009XICRIS,"unremittingly bleak. The main character is obnoxious without the ability to gain viewer sympathy, in her anger she lashes out at all who would help her.
