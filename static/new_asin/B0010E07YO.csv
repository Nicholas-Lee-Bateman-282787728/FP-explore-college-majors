8237711,4,B0010E07YO,I like what it states it has just have to get the right format to play it on in order to review the katas.,1466380800,,106,3.4583333333333335
8237712,2,B0010E07YO,"I bought this DVD expecting it to play on my DVD player, since my Toshiba Re-Write basically plays every format except PAL. However, this DVD is in a format called VPG and does not play on Toshiba players (I also tried it on my Toshiba TV/DVD combo player and a JPG DVD player to no avail.) So although the DVD is well produced and Andreas Ginger does a very good job demonstrating all 12 Goju-ryu katas (his style is more Japanese tournament than Okinawan traditional like Higaonna's) and it's worth watching, even if on a computer, neither the producer nor MA Supermarket mention there could be problems with US players reading the format. I've had this problem before with Mario's Kanazawa Kata DVD. If you are producing a DVD and want to sell it in the US, you should produce it in a format most US players can read. So beware. Make sure your player reads VPG.",1309478400,5,864,4.509554140127388
8237713,5,B0010E07YO,Anybody who knows anything about Goju-Ryu will love this Dvd. It shows every aspect of the Goju Kata's. It's in German as well as English. A very helpful dvd in polishing your kata's. It shows at least two angles when viewing a Kata. It also gives you the option to view a certain kata from the menu screen. I'm very impressed with this dvd. This man is a true Goju practitioner.,1282003200,3,379,4.352112676056338
