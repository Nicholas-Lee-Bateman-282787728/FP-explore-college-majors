8124337,4,B000FKP0DM,"This DVD shows what life was like in western towns from roughly 1860-1900.  The presentation is narrated by Keith Carradine and has numerous re-enactments.

They explain how the towns sprang up quickly and were aided by the railroad's expansion through the western territories. The towns served as outpost and brought some measure of civilization to the frontier.  The wealthier towns soon acquired all the trappings of eastern cities too - like reliable water supplies, stores, a sheriff's department, doctor, and of course, an ample supply of liquor.

Most of the re-enactments are good.  They aren't real serious - it's obvious they are actors, and some are funny, like showing a shoot out during a poker game, where after a hail of bullets no one was actually injured.

Later in the DVD they should some of the problems in the western towns, like the difficulty of fighting fires, disease, crude medical care, and technological changes that made some towns obsolete rather quickly.  It's an informative and casual look at the old west, and well worth viewing.",1376438400,,1063,5.04
