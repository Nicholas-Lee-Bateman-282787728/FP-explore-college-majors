He first realizes this when the new girl at school comes to live at his house with him and his 3 sisters. Ayumi, the new girl, is a witch. His 3 sisters are witches as well. They have been keeping many secrets from him. Ayumi has come to try to get him to lift a curse on her. That's pretty much the story line.

This anime is a lot of fun. It's short(13 episodes), but a series of this caliber doesn't really need more than that. This is a typical harem/ecchi series. 1 guy, half-a-dozen cute girls. It's mainly focused on the comedy aspect. There is a story line, but it really isn't important, and it doesn't get going till the end. Even without a good story, the comedy and fun characters make this s reasonably enjoyable series to watch once or twice. I have seen plenty of better harem anime series, but Magikano is fun and worth the few bucks it costs.",1354665600,,957,4.258241758241758
8222788,4,B000WDTNYE,"If I were to judge this series based purely on how much I enjoyed this opening volume, it would be receiving incredibly high marks. From start to finish I really found myself laughing at this series. The characters are very nicely drawn, the pacing is well done and the jokes are over the top but still very funny.

  While terribly funny and entertaining, it's just not original enough to get high marks. If you're willing to look past that though, what you're going to find is a highly entertaining series that will absolutely have you rolling.",1213747200,,546,4.666666666666667
8222789,5,B000WDTNYE,"this series is a mix of Negima and Maburaho (both of which are great series).  it is the story of one young man who is trying to get by day to day until a beautiful transfer student arrives.  and not to mention she is living with him and his three younger sisters as a maid.  but there are secrets as is it appears that the sisters and Ayuma (the maid) are actually witches and he is the only one in the family that does not appear to have any magic (and when he finds out they pull out these HUGE memory erasure hammers and whack him with them).  And the reason Auyma is there is she is under a curse and must make him a man....and bring out any magic he may have.

It is a tried and true formula for a harem comedy...throw in a cute rival for Auyma (also a witch), a witch hunter, a bunch of goofy friends and crazy mail order devices and there you are.....it is great with the dubbing, the animation is awesome and it gets good at the right times....",1198108800,6,953,4.074866310160428
8222790,4,B000WDTNYE,it was your typical girls trying to get the guy anime but has funny action as well. a little like maburaho in that there is amgic and just one main guy. the animation is nice and the dubbing is well done. there's plenty of laughs to keep it interesting.,1196726400,4,253,4.183673469387755
