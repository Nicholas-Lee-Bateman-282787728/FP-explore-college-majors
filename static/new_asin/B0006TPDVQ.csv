8043137,4,B0006TPDVQ,"I have never seen this DVD so I won't comment on its content but what I will do is offer my opinion about what has been done to the remains of this great ship and direct you to a pretty darn good forensic documentary about Titanic's final minutes on the surface.
I gave this four stars out of respect for the man who discovered The Titanic and the ship itself but I think it is disgraceful what past expeditions have done to the graveyard of this ship, granted, going to the artifacts shows has been an emotional roller coaster ride, seeing clothes and belongings that used to belong to people that are no longer living because they died onboard was just very difficult sometimes.
Personally, I would have rather have seen these articles left where they were as a monument to the thousands who died there, the ship itself is dissolving and will one day be an orange stain at the bottom of the ocean with nothing left of it but propellers and possibly the three story tall engines.
As for the documentary on some excellent forensic work on her striking the berg and subsequent sinking, you have to seek out the latest release of James Cameron's ""Titanic"" and in the special features, look for ""Titanic: The Final Word"", its very informative and it really gets to the root of what happened that night.
Cameron seems very determined, along with six other notably fine Titanic experts, go at it for close to two hours to piece together aspects of the collision, the flooding, the sinking and the fall to the ocean floor.
They also discuss how the boilers and other items from inside the ship, their location on the sea floor, determined where the Titanic broke up on the surface.
All in all, this documentary itself is worth a look at..""Titanic: The Final Word""...Check it out.",1364428800,,1773,4.613924050632911

We are actors and historians in Central Florida who regularly present inspirational programs about the ship and its passengers and crew.  I'd love to have a copy of it for my portfolio!,1329004800,,269,4.955555555555556

8043141,5,B0006TPDVQ,Great DVD. I use it every year with my students after a reading selection on the sinking of the Titanic. Great info on the state of the Titanic and leads to great discussion of the pros and cons of preserving the site and whether or not people have the right to salvage the artifacts.,1200614400,,284,4.277777777777778
8043142,4,B0006TPDVQ,"Such a huge contraversy surrounds Titanic and her treasures.  The right to salvage or not to salvage.  This DVD explains Dr. Ballard's side of the debate.  When actually meeting him and getting to talk with him, he truely believes that Titanic is a memorial and should be deemed as such, as an underwater museum.  And his plans for the future are fascinating.  This is a great documentary and really makes you think about the current situation with Titanic and the right to salvage along with Titanic's current state of condition.",1173484800,2,530,4.844444444444444
8043143,2,B0006TPDVQ,"Titanic Revealed.

I just purchased the DVD of this production. After watching the entire feature along with extras I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed.

From the way this DVD is promoted you expect a documentary of Dr. Ballard going back to the Titanic to go over what the grave robbers have done to it and document its condition. Sadly, we get that but in much less quantity that I expected. What we do often get is mini segments about Titanic collectors, super secret Navy missions, commentaries from people within the community and a debate about whether salvaging is appropriate. The interview with Ken Marschall is especially akward.

The segement about Dr. Ballard's ""super secret"" mission I think was being over dramatic and unecessary. Many people knew of his dives on the Thresher and the Scorpion right before the Titanic. So thats not some huge revelation as to why he got to search for the ship in 1985.

Personally, I was hoping for something akin to the National Geographic Special ""Secrets of the Titanic."" While filmed in 1985 with less sophisticated cameras. It honored the ship with no Jim Cameron style fluff and detours. That 1985 documentary stands out against later videos - it has heart, its human and it focuses on the ship. The Titanic is the star; not a sub, not a film maker. Dr. Ballard's original piece humanizes the wreck. The humanization is one of the most powerful elements of the Titanic story.

In the final anaylsis this production does not live up to how it hypes itself. It should be titled ""Titanic Debates with some footage of Bob Ballard again at the Titanic."" That is far more honest as to what this DVD is. Only the special section only partially redeems itself. It though is way too short and recycles video from the main feature.

I agree with Dr. Ballard it is terrible the way the wreck is being plundered for profit. Titanic is a graveyard and should be treated as such - with great respect. It should be honored and allowed to rest without vultures picking at the carcass.  More than one Titanic survivor felt that way.

For the price (almost $18) stay away from this DVD. If it were $5 I'd say its fine. However, for the hefty price tag for an hour and 15 minutes of a presentation that doesn't live up to its billing. Don't waste your money.",1137974400,44,2296,4.624078624078624
8043144,4,B0006TPDVQ,"I saw this documentry last summer on I think... the Discovery Channel. In it, Dr. Ballard returned to the titanic to see how she would appear, what was still in good condition, etc. Unfortunately, between 1986 and 2004, many artifacts were taken from the wreckage much to the disappointment of Ballard. I was fascinated by his new findings upon his return. What was most sad was the fact that someone had taken the plaque he had placed on the titanic in memory of those who were lost. Basically this is a part two of his first documentary that he did back in 1986 for National Geographic called ""Secrets of the Titanic"". It's a really great DVD for those who are fascinated by this historical disaster.",1110672000,20,702,4.624
