1881383,5,B000098ZT0,I really liked this movie. It was great seeing DeForest Kelley (The Doctor from Star Trek) very young and in a different role. The story went very well from beginning to end and I loved the ending. Good treat worth watching!!!,1478822400,,226,4.536585365853658

Another film adaptation of the story was ""Nightmare"" (1956), which starred Edward G. Robinson and Kevin McCarthy. Anyway, Woolrich is all about paranoia and suspense, but except for the scene where the protagonist hangs on a ledge outside his building, there's little here of either. It's very low budget, a little dull visually and narratively, and some of the mystery tropes used are a bit dated. Still, it's a cool premise (maybe even iconic) and the film is pretty faithful to the text of the story, if not the spirit. And it's short, which doesn't hurt.",1471046400,,775,4.834586466165414

1881395,4,B000098ZT0,"This was ""Bones"" McCoy's, that is, Deforest Kelley's first movie role! And he was great! He played the perfect part: a poor Joe who wakes one morning with visions of a murder bouncing around inside his head. Just a nightmare, right? Nope! Before he knows it, Kelley's character, simple bank teller Vince Grayson, has been made into a patsy for a double murder! The problem is that he can't remember much of anything about what happened the night before. Out of desperation, he turns to his brother-in-law Cliff Herlihy, a detective, to help sort things out. What results is an absolutely fun whodunit as Kelley, with the help of his brother-in-law, slowly try to piece together what really happened. Good stuff for no other reason than we get to see Kelley make his trademark raised eyebrow in a film noir! While the ending is very contrived and cornball, the rest of the film is sheer fun (with a particular emphasis on the coked-up, as Phil Marlowe would say, dream sequences that were done with some nice animation)!

1881412,4,B000098ZT0,"A man has a vivid and bizarre nightmare of committing murder in an octangular mirrored room then wakes up drenched in sweat with the strange looking key from the dream clenched in his hand.  Is it possible the dream was real and he actually murdered a man he didn't know in a room he had never seen before?

Fear in the Night isn't the most high profile film adaptation of prolific writer Cornell Woolrich's work--Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window was inspired by a Cornell Woolrich story and many were adapted as episodes of the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents.  The 1940's also saw many big screen versions of his work including The Window, The Night Has A Thousand Eyes, Phantom Lady, Deadline at Dawn, Black Angel and others.  But if Fear in the Night was a poverty-row B movie with no stars (lead Deforest Kelly would have an anonymous career until landing the role of Dr McCoy on Star Trek 19 years later) it also captures the flavor of Cornell Woolrich's pulpy prose better than any other adaptation before or since.  Cornell Woolrich was a disreputable author who wrote so quickly that he had to adopt two pseudonyms in order to get all of his work published (William Irish and George Hopley).  Fear in the Night lacks polish and production values but it goes for the throat with some wild visual effects, a lean 72 minute running time and a bizarre premise that the film embraces completely.

Cornell Woolrich had an unrealistic understanding of certain things like the effects of marihuana (Reefer Madness seems to have been his primary source of information) and the power of hypnotism, so reading his stories today sometimes requires a healthy ability to suspend disbelief. Woolrich frequently came up with irresistible hooks for his stories which is why so many of them were filmed for the big screen or television.  But his work was so grounded in the period in which he wrote that adaptations trickled down to virtually zero after the 1950's--the only notable adaptation of a Cornell Woolrich story in the 1960's was Francois Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black in 1968.

Fear in the Night has one of those irresistible set-ups but the explanation for what's going on turns out to be pretty ridiculous so modern viewers who are unable to swallow the outrageous and bizarre, frequent elements in vintage pulp fiction, will likely find Fear in the Night to be a very silly waste of time.  But fans of poverty-row B movies and Cornell Woolrich consider Fear in the Night to be a genuine classic.

There's an interesting factoid concerning Fear in the Night that people might not know--United Artist released a bigger budget nearly scene-for-scene remake in 1956 called Nightmare starring Edward G Robinson and Kevin McCarthy.  Maxwell Shane who wrote the screenplay for Fear in the Night directed the remake himself using the same script.  Despite bigger name acting talent and a more generous budget Nightmare has been almost completely forgotten while Fear in the Night has developed a well-deserved cult audience over the years.

One final note about the quality of the Amazon streaming print--having only seen fuzzy public domain copies of Fear in the Night over the years it was a shock to see the movie restored in a gorgeous new black and white print.  The Amazon version is from the Wade William Collection--the same company that restored Plan Nine From Outer Space, White Zombie, Detour, D.O.A. and many others--their specialty is creating pristine restorations of movies that were previously only available in terrible looking public domain copies.  While that likely isn't terribly profitable my understanding is that Wade Williams collected films for many years and that the restored prints come from his personal collection.  Anyone familiar with the Wade Williams Collection knows what to expect quality-wise and they won't be disappointed.",1428710400,,3871,4.995334370139969

1881420,3,B000098ZT0,"Sometimes we have to go back to older films to find some of the charm that's missing in today's world, and some of the technology that was missing in the past. Some of the language used in these movies is almost quaint, innocent even. In this particular movie, a man is wearing a wire to get a confession. The fun part is that it is being recorded on a phonograph record, not a cassette, or computer. This is part of the joy in watching older films, and I'll never understand why younger people think that the only good movies have to be in color. Film Chest Restoration company brings us Fear In The Night.

In this 1947 film Vince (A pre-Star Trek DeForest Kelly, looking a little like Gary Sinise) is haunted by a dream in which he kills a man he doesn't know, when he is accidentally handed the murder weapon by the dead mans female accomplice. After waking from this dream,, he finds that he has the closet key in his pocket in which he hid the body in, and also a button from the dead mans coat. He calls in sick to work in order to talk to his brother in law detective Cliff (Paul Kelley). At first, Cliff just brushes this off as a bad dream, and the key & the button were just things Vince happened to have and forgot about. As the film progresses though, things become clearer and Cliff is starting to wonder if Vince truly is a murderer, and using the dream angle just to try to get sympathy. As the story plays out you'll find there are surprises and red herrings in store for everyone involved, including the viewer.

Being a 1947 ultra low budget film, you have to wonder how this is still even a watchable print. Well, we can thank the good folks at Film Chest Restoration for that to a degree. I still wonder what the source print was that they had to work with. This restored print still has a lot of damage, dirt and debris. There is also a faint humming sound in the background throughout the duration of the film. The print is also quite dark in places, and I wonder if that could have been improved. All of these questions will have to go unanswered as this film is a bare bones release with no extras whatsoever. I was hoping at the very least for a feature on the restoration process, but there is nothing but chapter stops and the film itself on the disc. It's shot in the regular aspect ratio 1.33:1 and the sound is a sometimes muffled mono. If you're a fan of this film, I'd advise you to try to find a way to see it first to see if this upgrade is worth a purchase. If you've never seen the film before, a rental is still advised before spending the money for a copy.",1410393600,,2595,4.240404040404041

DVD Review

Fear In The Night, DeForest Kelley, Paul Kelly, directed by Maxwell Shane, Paramount Pictures, 1947

Okay here is the familiar rote. Not all crime noir is top shelf, top shelf like Out Of The Past or The Maltese Falcon. By now that proposition has been pretty well established after more than a score of crime noir reviews in this space. Still some of these things can be sleepers, of a sort. Take the film under review, Fear In The Night. On the face of it looking at the unfamiliar cast, the no-name director and the B-movie quality of the production one would throw this one in the has been bin. And mainly that would be right, except that the story line possibilities, never fully exploited, save it for the justly deserved extinction of many of the films in this genre.

Let me show you. A bank clerk (played by Deforest Kelley), an average just trying to get ahead in this wicked old world 1940s marble building bank clerk, has a terrible dream, a nightmare really and cannot figure it out, cannot figure out why he would have, dream or not, murdered an unknown stranger. Moreover in the fresh light of day he cannot figure it out when many parts, too many parts, of the dream wind up being reality. So said clerk takes his problem to a very convenient brother-in-law who just happens to be a homicide detective (played by Paul Kelly). After a ton and one half of skepticism the detective finally sees that this is one bank clerk who is in serious trouble. And solving this riddle is what makes this thing kind of twist and turn a little before the real bad guy is caught.

And the real bad guy, or rather his maniacal plan of operation, is what could have made this thing jump better than it did. Seems a Mayfair swell, a very jealous Mayfair swell, with a young wandering wife finds out she has been keeping company with someone else on his time. So he, the Mayfair swell Mr. Belknap by name, sees red but knowing that crime doesn't pay or rather that he doesn't want to pay for the crime sets our bank clerk up, sets him up big-time, through hypnosis. That little off-beat technique makes all the difference in the world. And the theme that could have better explored the social tensions in this film as we know all too well as of late- the rich don't want o pay for nothing from taxes to their crimes-never gets it full workout. Why? Well, easy on that one. Something that also has become a mantra in this space. Crime, well crime in crime noir, doesn't pay. Just ask our Mayfair swell.",1323475200,,2598,4.426778242677824

1881432,4,B000098ZT0,"""Fear in the Night"" is a semi-supernatural thriller adapted by the film's director Maxwell Shane from Cornell Woolrich's story ""Nightmare"". This is a true B-movie, complete with clumsy but not ineffective visual effects, clocking in at only one hour and 10 minutes. As in so many B-movies of the 1940s, the economical narrative gives us a lot of movie in a short time. It lacks the hard edge and stylistic sophistication of many film noirs, but ""Fear in the Night"" probably falls within the noir style. Its introverted, chaotic, paranoid universe inside the protagonist's mind is the stuff that both existential and surrealist thinkers found to love in film noir.

""Fear in the Night"" opens with a puzzling, vaguely lit scene inside an octagonal room with mirrored walls. It hardly seems real. A man and a woman are trying to drill a safe when another man interrupts them. The two men struggle, and the second man kills the first. The next morning, Vince Grayson (DeForest Kelley) awakes from a nightmare of killing a man in that room. But evidence suggests that it may not have been a dream. Unsure if his memory is real or imagined, tormented by violent visions, he seeks the advice of his police detective brother-in-law Cliff Herlihy (Paul Kelly). Cliff insists that the dream could not be real. Vince's uneasy, muddled mental state persists, so Cliff to browbeats him into accompanying the family on a picnic in the country. Vince begins to remember the landscape . Seeking shelter from a thunderstorm, he leads them to a house with the octagonal mirrored room. Now Cliff is convinced that Vince is a murderer and a liar.

It's unfortunate that Vince's character is not fleshed out more. But the confusion, torment, and alienation that bring him to the brink of self-destruction come across strongly. That's why ""Fear in the Night"" works. Vince is an Everyman suddenly plunged into a nightmare, unsure of his own mind, unable to connect with the people who care for him. He doesn't even know if the situation is one of his own making or something that fate has cruelly thrust upon him. His life is suddenly out of his control. I can't say that DeForest Kelley is anything more than adequate. Credit for what this film does well has to go to its director. It's not a polished film. The score is overbearing.  But ""Fear in the Night"" gets us inside of Vince's living nightmare. The Alpha Video DVD (2003) is full of specks and spots and has generally poor picture and sound quality, including some clipped dialogue. It's watchable but nothing more. No bonus features.",1152835200,,2570,4.8099547511312215
1881433,4,B000098ZT0,"As it has been mentioned before, the quality of this movie isn't very good. It's only a B-movie and it looks like they saved money by not using enough light and cutting the film with an axe.

But - the actors are great. I bought the movie because I'm a DeForest Kelley fan and interested in his early work. I was impressed. He's very believable as a man who doesn't know if he's commited murder. Paul Kelly gives a solid performance and the story is unusual. The movie is not as good as ""Laura"" or ""The Woman in the Window"" but has it's moments. If you like old fashioned movies or want to know what Kelley did before he made westerns and science fiction, ""Fear in the Night"" is worth your time and money.",1110326400,,705,4.2611940298507465

Sometimes there were shadows where it was so dark I couldn't see what the characters were looking at.  However, if you like Star Trek and old films this is pretty good.

But,  this DVD appears to be a copy of something shot off a movie screen with a camcorder and its visual quality is just at the threshold of human perception.  The low price made it attractive enough to revive my memory of the more visible original.",1092268800,,373,4.211267605633803
1881436,4,B000098ZT0,"Two decades before he boldly went where no man had gone before aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise, DeForest Kelly starred in Fear in the Night, a vintage dark noir film (not to be confused with the 1972 Hammer film of the same name).  Kelly plays a humble bank teller named Vince Grayson who awakens from a horrible dream, only to find that his nightmare may have been all too real.  In the dream, he struggled with and then killed a man inside an odd octagonal room of mirrors.  His relief upon waking up is dashed when he looks in the mirror and finds thumb marks on his neck.  A quick self-inventory also reveals dried blood on his wrist and, most disturbingly of all, a key and button in his pocket, the very same items he grasped during his struggle in the dream.  Naturally, he is both bewildered and horrified, and his need to talk about the situation leads him to his brother-in-law.  Given the fact that his brother-in-law is a homicide detective, this doesn't strike me as the ideal plan.  In any event, the guy doesn't believe him.  A week later, Vince accompanies his sister and her cop husband as well as his own would-be sweetheart on a picnic.  They seek shelter in a house at the beginning of a rainstorm, and wouldn't you know it, it's the same house as the one in Vince's dream.  Things suddenly aren't looking too good for Vince, especially when he learns that a man was murdered in the house a week earlier.  There's really only one fairly predictable way to explain these confusing events, yet the film still manages to maintain a significant amount of suspense up through its final moments.  I found Fear in the Night to be quite a good film noir movie, complete with all the voiceovers and crescendo-happy music you would expect to find in this type of film.",1062115200,,1775,4.529780564263323

7990201,4,B000098ZT0,"My interest in noir literature and film noir led over the years to an interest in Cornell Woolrich (1903 -- 1968).  Woolrich was a prolific writer, and many of his novels and stories became adopted in noir films.  I have seen adaptations of Woolrich's works in the annual D.C. Noir Film Festival. I have also seen other adaptations on my own.  Looking for a film to pass a dreary evening, I found this 1947 film ""Fear in the Night"" which is now in the public domain.  The film is an adaptation of a story ""And so to Death"" Woolrich wrote in 1939 under the pseudonym of William Irish. He retitled the story ""Nightmare"" in 1943.  With two titles and two named authors, it is fitting that there are two versions of the film.  The second, titled ""Nightmare"" was released in 1956 by Maxwell Shane, who also directed this 1947 film.

As with other film adaptations of Woolrich,, ""Fear in the Night"" relies heavily on surreal scenes of hallucination.  The film opens with a young man, a rather bland, boring bank teller, Vince Grayson, having a nightmare in which he kills a man in a large, isolated house in a room filled with mirrors. The film gets inside Grayson's mind through the use of voiceovers. Grayson becomes increasingly troubled and goes to his brother-in-law, Cliff Herlihy an older man who is a police detective. At first, Cliff tries to persuade Grayson not to worry about the nightmare, but through a series of event Cliff realizes his guilt.  When the tormented Grayson attempts suicide, Cliff gets to the bottom of the crime and realizes that Grayson has been the victim of a criminal hypnotist.

The film is a character study of a likeable if shallow man who does not know the depths of evil.  The movie has many of the classic features of noir including black and white angular cinematography, rainy nights, deserted old homes and back roads, and ever-present fedoras and cigarettes. DeForest Kelly portrays Vince Grayson in his first film role while Paul Kelly portrays Cliff. The acting is adequate but wooden. The film develops character, a sense of lurking fear and depravity, and suspense.

""Fear in the Night"" is a B grade low budget film. I enjoyed it and found it worth seeing. The major attraction of the film was seeing another film adaptation of Cornell Woolrich.  He is a noir writer I have come to admire.

A man talks about a room. He enters, another man attacks him, but falls. Is this a nightmare? He awakes in his bed. But there are two thumb prints on his neck! He has a strange key now. Is he going insane? Or sick? He calls in sick to his place of work - a bank. Vince Grayson isn't well, or at home. He goes to see his brother-in-law at home and explains his dream. His coworker is there. He puts an ad in the newspaper for a house with a mirrored room. The next day they go for a car ride in the country and stop for a meal. Vince is still upset, he rejects Betty. Then it rains so they return. Vince remembers this area. They turn off the road and come to a big mansion. There is a key under the mat, so they enter to find a warm dry place. They start a fire in the fireplace of this empty house. Vince finds a room like the one he dreamt about! His brother-in-law accuses him of lying.

A deputy sheriff arrives to investigate their presence. A murder was committed there last week. A burglar killed the wife while the husband was on a business trip. Vince and his brother-in-law visit the police station to learn more. Vince recognized the people in the pictures! He faints. They return home. Cliff talks to Vince in his room, then leaves. Vince opens a window and looks down. Cliff grabs him just in time! Betty will drive Lil home, Cliff will stay with Vince. They talk. Vince tells him about the man in the next room. Cliff leaves on an errand, then returns with a mans picture; he explains what happened. Cliff has a plan to clear Vince. Vince meets Mr. Belknap. Belknap talks about what he did, a confession. Can Vince be hypnotized? Can the police stop Belknap? There is a dramatic scene in a car. Can the police save Vince? There is a car chase, Belknaps car crashes. Vince is saved. The story is in the newspapers. There is a happy ending.

This is based on the story Nightmare by William Irish. Is it believable or plausible? Maybe it sounds good on paper, but showing it as a re-enactment shows its implausibility (unless you suspend belief). Some may like this story. When a wife is killed the husband is the prime suspect. I wonder why the police didn't check the husbands alibi about being in Mexico?",1489622400,,2248,4.297169811320755
