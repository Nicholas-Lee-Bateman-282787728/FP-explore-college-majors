8400369,4,B003MC4XNI,"We have been ordering all the Fantastic Movie Trailers discs lately, after enjoying the 42nd Street Forever series before it, and we haven't been disappointed so far. Although we watch them for pure enjoyment, they're also helping us prepare for an upcoming episode of our podcast focusing on classic trailers.

""Volume Four: Encore"" was much more watchable than the sometimes overly gory Volume 3. the quality of the trailers vary because of various sources for the material, but overall they are very watchable.
