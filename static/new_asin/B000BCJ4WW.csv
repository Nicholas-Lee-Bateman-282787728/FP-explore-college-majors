2414005,4,B000BCJ4WW,"I use this DVD when I massage my 3 month old. When he is in a good mood he loves the massage. I keep the massage to no more than 15 minutes after which my son's patience runs out. On the DVD the baby is really calm...not sure if the baby is calm due to the massage or is just a calm baby.

It has some good techniques for releaving gas and nasal congestion. The DVD suggests doing the massage in a warm room and that is key -- masseuse and baby will enjoy the massage and bond.",1169078400,2,477,3.86734693877551
2414006,4,B000BCJ4WW,I found this video to be repetitive & a bit boring for the experienced therapist. However for a beginner it's wonderful.,1168387200,2,120,4.761904761904762
2414007,4,B000BCJ4WW,"found this tape to be extremely helpful and really good for bonding with baby we do it every night after a bath and my daughter is now 6 months old. (we started at one month!) I am a massage therapist but never had any expirience with little ones, it was a great guide.",1167868800,2,269,4.09433962264151
2414008,5,B000BCJ4WW,"I was really into infant massage and purchased It's Baby Time, Baby Tata, and Infant Massage- Power of Touch. It's Baby Time is really the best. It has the most information, is fun and has a variety of routines and great songs that don't get boring. Also, if you are dealing with colic, or teething- it has good sections on how to deal with those using massage.",1149292800,16,361,4.402985074626866
2414009,5,B000BCJ4WW,"I am a new mother, and watching this DVD has become a regular occurance in the afternoons. My baby just loves the massage routine.  Once she had some constipation, and I did the specific work that the  DVD shows for that- and it worked! I notice that she also sleeps better at nights after doing the routine. I love that the DVD is fun, and yet has great tips that have really helped.",1136764800,15,384,4.2465753424657535
8085222,2,B000BCJ4WW,"This was an...interesting video. The ""great music"" was strange and irritating and the lady working with the baby made me uncomfortable watching. Great techniques but definitely would rather look up free videos on YouTube. And the man's voice was SUPER creepy and out of place.

1/10, would not watch again :/",1452470400,,308,5.03921568627451
8085223,5,B000BCJ4WW,"Wonder, fantastic seller and product. It was received sooner than expected and is better than expected. Wonderful!!!!",1415836800,,117,5.9411764705882355
8085224,3,B000BCJ4WW,"It has some good massage strokes for a baby but some of it, if you are a LMT you would be able to figure out yourself.",1364083200,,118,3.576923076923077
8085225,4,B000BCJ4WW,"I found the DVD very helpful in giving a practical and simple way to demonstrate infant massage to beginners and for people who know little about the benefits of infant massage. It is instructional yet not boring. However, I do think the two infant massage routines could have been combined. I think all parents of newborns should have a copy.",1320278400,,343,4.733333333333333
8085226,2,B000BCJ4WW,I found this DVD to be kind of boring and  repetitive. It was not very professional and I didn't get a lot out of it. I thought a lot of the information was just common sense. I also purchased Aimee's Babies and I liked it so much more. Aimee is a pediatric occupational therapist with a ton of information. It was much more informative and professionally made.  I would definitely recommend Aimee's Babies over this one.,1264636800,,421,4.526315789473684
8085227,5,B000BCJ4WW,I bought this and started using parts of the video with my son when he was 2 months old. I did not know anything about infant massage. He loved it and he was a very fussy infant. This was fun and easy to use. My son is 5 months and loves to look at the DVD while we do massage. It has cute songs and graphics. I would highly recommend this DVD!,1219363200,,344,3.7916666666666665
8085228,5,B000BCJ4WW,"My baby and I love, love, love this video.  She watches the screen and chills out while I sing the sing-a-long songs to her all the while getting the massage.  It's nicely paced and mellow.  My daughter feels calm and usually sleeps so well during her naps for the rest of the day!",1178409600,3,281,4.264150943396227
8085229,5,B000BCJ4WW,"Great!

We loved the music, fun flower graphics, and routines. Watching the DVD and doing the massage has become a regular nightly routine for us in our house. I have even caught my husband singing the sing-along songs during the day! Ha ha.",1173657600,,241,4.604651162790698
8085230,5,B000BCJ4WW,My 3 month old loves the massage exercises.  It seems just long enough to hold her attention.  I particulary like the songs. I would definitely recommend this to others.,1173312000,,169,4.793103448275862
8085231,2,B000BCJ4WW,"I purchased this DVD based off the positive reviews. This DVD was a bit odd. It is very cheaply made, the music is jazzy which does not seem to fit with baby massage and the joy segment is almost exactly the same as the peace segment just a little different music. It is not enjoying to watch. I gave it two stars because I did learn some good information. Once I have mastered the massage moves I will not longer use the DVD because it is really annoying. I wish I had purchased baby TaTa insead, it looks more professional.",1170892800,5,525,4.26
