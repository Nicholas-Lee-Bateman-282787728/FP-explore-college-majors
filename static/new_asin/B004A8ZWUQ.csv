4295636,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"It has been four years since the last we saw Captain Jack Sparrow in the bloated third film of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, but this time he is back in a stand alone story that has little to do with the previous three. This may be the shortest of the four movies as well (around 2 hours and 15 minutes) and it's never boring, but for some reason it still seems too long. I must admit that I liked Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, but the first one, as with most movie series, will always be the best. On Stranger Tides might even be slightly better than the last two sequels. At least it's not as confusing as At World's End, but I can pretty much say that if you didn't like the last two you'll probably feel the same about this one.

Johnny Depp it seems will keep playing this character until the day he dies. I read that he wants to do at least two more PotC movies. Yes he has created one of the most memorable characters in movie history, but too much of a good thing can turn annoying real quick. I think he fares quite well this time around, more so than the last two, even though Jack Sparrow gets more and more goofy with each outing. Geoffrey Rush is back as Captain Barbossa and has his moments. Ian McShane has the look suited for Blackbeard, the most feared pirate of all time, but they should have made him much taller as was the real man. Depp even towered over him in some scenes, making him less intimidating. He also didn't do as much with this villainous role as I was hoping for. Those who have seen McShane on Deadwood know what I mean. Since Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are gone, Penlope Cruz tries to fill the void as the daughter of Blackbeard. She looks good of course, but there wasn't much chemistry between her and Depp. The addition of mermaids was my favorite part, and these are like no mermaids I've ever heard of. Their beauty lures you in before dragging you underwater to be drowned and devoured.

I read that the budget was half of the last film (around 150 instead of 300 million), but I really didn't notice. The CGI and sets looked up to par. Of course you also will get more than enough of that loud Han Zimmer score that runs through the whole series.

Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is not a great movie and it might leave you with the impression that you have already seen this before, but as a mindless piece of summer entertainment it gets the job done.

Oh, the IMAX 3-D looked really clear, but I'm not sure it was worth double the price.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1305849600,,2552,4.25360824742268
4295637,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"This is a review of the movie seen at the theater, NOT the BD release planned for the future.

Chances are if you're reading this you're a fan of the Pirates franchise, and/or Depp and company so are willing to overlook the fact that this is a money spinning exercise set squarely in the ""popcorn flick"" genre of summer blockbusters.
Much has been made of the absence of Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, in so far as they thought it enough of a ridiculous and unnecessary 4th outing as to not be involved, but the inclusion of Penelope Cruz, and Ian McShane more than make up for that anyway (in my opinion).

This latest, somewhat shorter installment treads much of the same ground as the previous 3 to no surprise, and like them or hate them, you have to agree in part to continuing a winning formula. A critics dream this is not, but of course it will still wow plenty of summer audiences, and no doubt be a financial success.

So to my ""muddled"" comment. Well the story (which was probably conceived as a good idea somewhere) revolves around Jack Sparrow searching for the fountain of youth.
Tagging along are the ever pleasing Jeffrey Rush as Barbossa chewing scenery as he goes, and arch nemesis Ian McShane as Blackbeard, complete with beautiful daughter Cruz.
Secret silver chalices, CGI mermaids that change from beauty to beast while attacking, and an ever present need for the cast to explain what is going on, just makes the whole thing look muddled.

Depp's antics stretch credulity even more than usual, as does most of the story, from an initial escape (again) to the plot twisting quest. Another criticism for me would be that Cruz and Depp do not have the spark or chemistry they should, probably safer to say that Depp and Rush have more.

Of course it's a PG-13 so the action and eye candy abound. That's probably what saves the movie somewhat, it's less plodding than the previous movies, and as long as you can suspend disbelief enough, you'll enjoy the action sequences that seem to bombard most of the film.

No spoilers here, just accept it for what it is. 3 Stars",1305849600,,2090,4.604838709677419
4295638,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"The Pirates of the Caribbean films have never pretended to be anything that they're not. Their inspiration was an amusement park ride after all. The films seem to be more of a vehicle for Johnny Depp to step inside of a character he has a little too much fun playing and are aimed toward women (and men, in some cases) who like to oggle him more than anything. The sequels just felt like an already thin premise was stretched beyond its means, which resulted in lackluster sequels that came off as being too similar to the original film. They were still entertaining on some level and people really seem to love the franchise. But you can't expect a new sequel to come along and break the mold, especially when the previous films have made over $2.5 billion at the worldwide box office. On Stranger Tides pretty much offers more of the same for its fans.

The Pirates films have never shied away from action, but On Stranger Tides seems to have even more than the films before it. It's Jack Sparrow's first film away from Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, so some over the top antics can probably be expected. Most of the film felt like an episode of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" except it was centered around Jack Sparrow instead of the Duke boys and revolved around the open sea and The Black Pearl instead of Hazzard county and General Lee. Most of the scenes could basically be described in that voice over that'd say something along the lines of, ""Jack's sure gotten himself into one heck of a pickle this time. How in the world will he swashbuckle his way out of this one?""

With Jack worming his way out of several crazy situations and nearly non-stop swordplay and action, the film's cast could probably be considered better than decent. Geoffrey Rush and Kevin McNally are the only returning cast members from the previous films other than Depp and they slide back into the Barbossa and Gibbs characters just as easily as Depp channels Jack Sparrow. Angelica, played by Penelope Cruz, was a little too convenient of a character. A former love interest of Jack's who hasn't forgiven or forgotten the way things ended between them. Their relationship and the way things pan out between them just seemed rather predictable in the long run. Ian McShane was pretty disappointing, as well. He's given this incredibly cool character in Blackbeard. All pirates fear him; he has this awesome pirate ship, and can bring men back from the dead. He even has a few memorable one liners, but the guy couldn't have looked more bored during the entire film. Johnny Depp looks to be the only guy actually having fun in this film while everyone else just sees it as another job. On Stranger Tides still has an entertaining vibe to it, but also feels like a film we've seen three times before.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is familiar territory. By now you should have a good idea of whether or not you'll enjoy the film or not. It follows the same formula as the previous three films, but is the shortest of the films and seems to be lacking a story that really reels you in. Audiences love Johnny Depp, so there's no doubt it'll be a success. The action does seem to be amped up a bit, but Jack Sparrow seems goofier than ever. It's humorous at times, but similar to Homer getting dumber in every new season of ""The Simpsons."" While the film wasn't a huge home run with critics, it's still the explosive and extravagant return of a character everyone loves and is bound to set the box office on fire once again.",1305763200,5,3512,4.571428571428571

4296440,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Among the Pirates anthology this was clearly the worst. Entertaining, but nothing Ill choose to watch again.

So much has changed over the course of four Pirates movies. Now pledged to the crown, we find a bewigged Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush; Gods of Egypt, The Warriors Way, The Kings Speech), peg-legging about complete with make-up, explaining how he lost the Black Pearl.  Much as did Norrington in parts 1-2, Barbossas allegiance his shifted dramatically.  But were used to that in this franchise, aren't we?

Picking up where At Worlds End (2007) left off, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp; Blow) endeavors to find the Fountain of Youth, and he must do so before the Spanish find it first!

Jack needs a ship, and finds opportunity when rumors of another Jack Sparrow (an imposter) signing on new crew members.  This imposter is Angelica (Penelope Cruz; Blow, Vanilla Sky), Jacks ex-girlfriend and the first mate of the sorcerous Captain Blackbeard (Ian McShane; Jack the Giant Slayer, John Wick 2).  Interesting how undeath seems to be a theme throughout the Pirates films.  Rumored to have returned from the dead, Blackbeard has created zombified crewmen and wields a magical control of his ship.

To reap the gifts of the Fountain of Youth requires a mermaid (Astrid Berg&egrave;s-Frisbey; King Arthur: Legend of the Sword). Only one problem: mermaids are ferocious man-eaters.  The mermaid attack scene was outstandingly fun.

Director Rob Marshall (Chicago, Memoirs of a Geisha) picks up the fourth installment of the Pirates anthology after Gore Verbinskis original trilogy. So, what does that mean for us? Well, nothing good really.  Our senses are no longer dazzled by Verbinskis realization of grand scale.  And this loss of scale is not limited to the cinescapes, but the execution.  Jacks stunt-rich shenanigans are fine, but seem just mildly entertaining iterations compared to his past films.  And whereas the swordplay choreography itself was on point, the overall scenes and fights lacked impact.  Moreover, whereas many ship sets looked excellent (as is the mega-budget franchise standard), several other sets (e.g., the caverns) felt as if they spawned from a far lower budget filmcertainly not the product of a $250 million blockbuster!  Its as if we set up our coolers and lawn chairs at dusk awaiting fireworks only to be met with sparklers.  And speaking of sparklers, this was the first Pirates film that had no significant ship-to-ship combat!

It doesnt help, for my taste anyway, that everything seems sillier in this sequel. We have silly disguises (many times over), silly balancing gags (like a teetering ship), silly escape gags (like climbing a tree backwards and sling-shoting oneself), silly maneuver gags (like tying up 8 men at once by running around them with a rope like a cartoon character) is this to make this more kid-friendly? I even had to watch a completely forced man-mermaid love connection transpire, boasting no more chemistry than that between a man and an actual fish.  Wheres Will and Elizabeth when we need them?  Their love was credible.

On the other hand, the plot is not overly complicated.  The double-crosses were few, and the story was followable without having seen The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) and Dead Mans Chest (2006), like yesterday, in order to have a clue whats going onwhich was the case with the confounding At Worlds End (2007).  Another perk was that, as usual, the ships look fantastic.  I always loved how every captains ship had as much personality in appearance as the men crewing them.  But, with that, another downer: we lost many members of the crew we had come to love and the tentacled effects we came to love!  Oh, right, and why was this Fountain of Youth plot even important???  There was really never a good reason to find the fountain outside of greed.  Ergo, no urgency for us to care.

Overall, this was a dud. Its a huge budget popcorn movie and I didn't exactly hate watching it as a standalone filmunlike the overly prequel-reliant parts 2 or 3but this was the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull of the Pirates anthology. We all know its there, but none of us want to acknowledge its existence after weve seem it.  Id suggest the next time you watch the original trilogy, skip to Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) and ignore this one.",1496275200,,4332,4.941988950276243
4296441,3,B004A8ZWUQ,I am not a big fan of Pirates of the Caribbean movies but they are good enough to watch.  My expectations were low as Rotten Tomatoes showed the reviews were not great.  I thought it was better than the 3rd movie in the series which I thought was silly.  I bought it because it was 3D and I got it for $15 which is a decent price for a 3d movie.  I am very happy I got it.  I noticed the couple (Orlando Bloom and an actress) were missing.  They were not missed at all.  If it was due to salary negotiations the movie studio made the right call.,1496188800,,545,3.944954128440367

I found the second movie to be fine, and I really disliked the third. On Stranger Tides is a return to form in a lot of ways. I don't know if Jack Sparrow should be the main character, as great as Depp is in the role it's a little overkill at times, but this movie goes back to the basics from the first film. It's a smaller, more contained story without all of the heavy handed drama the second and third films wallowed in. It's a silly, fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Sometimes that's just fine.",1495152000,10,675,4.1603053435114505
4296469,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Really wanted to like this but it misses the magic made in the the previous 3. Im sure its the directors changing that caused this but it seemed to have different lighting, coloring, angles and basic story line that seemed to have so much more potential. I loved the story but some of the bits (shadowed fight between Jack and ""Jack"") were a bit silly, even for this series. What I missed was the previously present musical score that seemed to be not as upfront. Same composer but seemed subdued.

4296588,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"First and foremost, I offer NO spoilers. Just a quick and honest opinion of the quality and watchability.

 Pirates OTC has got to be one of the coolest movies out there period! We as a family have enjoyed every single iteration of this series of movies! they just keep getting better! After each one we are like just praying that there will be another and this one in particular left us wanting more! The acting is hilarious, the screen play is exciting and we are taken on an adventure every time! Being able to enjoy this one in 3D was a real treat to the eyes and senses. Please keep in mind that not all 3D TV's are made the same and some do a much better job at rendering 3D than others. Luckily we have a very nice 65"" 3D TV that does an excellent job at rendering the most perfect 3D image possible, and in turn we get to enjoy 3D as it is intended to be viewed! So if you have a good 3D TV I would suggest getting this in 3d and enjoying the treat it offers. Also I need to point out that some 3D movies are not done well or done right. However, this one was done VERY well, and done right too!
 If your a POTC fan, then don't hesitate and jump right into this one, you'll be glad you did!",1489449600,3,1198,4.025210084033613

I'm not going to make this too long as a matter fact I'm going to make this as easy as possible. Do you remember the magic of the first film and the way that that film made you feel and laugh and how it sucked you into the story? Then I would most definitely watch this movie because this movie more than any of the sequels reminded me of the first movie again and what made it so good. To me they kind of lost a little something in part 2 and especially in part 3. But in this movie that magic that the first film had really seems to be back and Johnny Depp is 100% back into the character we know and love. The actors shine in this movie as a matter of fact the acting is excellent and anyone who says any different didn't really bother to watch the film. Hands down the best film since the original and I'm hoping that the next one follows the same suit. As far as entertainment goes this movie really delivers on all fronts and I honestly had a very hard time finding any failures. The only major failure is the fact that the critics ever had the opportunity to review this film because they were dead wrong. As they often are. Be your own critic, watch the film and enjoy the resurrection of Jack Sparrow.

4297099,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Let's pick a narrative and stick with it. All of the movies in the franchise suffer from this schizophrenic universe. It's like the script was written by Gloria Steinem and Simone de Beauvoir. I can't figure out how I'm supposed to feel sorry for the women in the story. Am I supposed to celebrate her female empowerment while dealing with boneheaded men, or feel feel the need to protect her when she faints or does some other girly thing? Is beauty of women really what's important, while you leave your own father to suffer for eternity while you go chase some tail? Is that really what is so important? Do what Captain Jack Sparrow does, find some other girls. Granted, Jack could lose the womanizing.
I passed over all the contrived coincidences and cop-outs but it got really tiring with the excessive narm before I have a chance to start believing the story. The political message is so overt that it's chronically distracting and none of the characters except Jack is likable. It's not that I hate the actors, I think they actors did a great job convincing me, but I think the character design was so contrived that I just couldn't believe it. Also, why is a girl fighting a bunch of men and not losing? Sorry, but there's a huge strength advantage. I can't be bought with any line to the contrary since even in universe, the women demonstrate female tropes as fragility and neediness.
Too much contrived love for any sort of action movie, this movie demonstrates. I want to watch a fight, even though the fights are hard to believe, but why are we interrupting my movie to for a piece of love-plot that doesn't have any real bearing on the outcome? If some girl doesn't want to wait for me to finish a fight before we get married, we're not getting married (OK, that's for a previous movie, but still, it's the universe).
I couldn't stomach the second half of the movie. Way too much narm, way too much unbelievable love story, and too many cop-outs. This really makes for a water thin plot.
Sometimes, I ask myself, did Micheal Bayes make this movie? Some of these scenes remind me of Michael's movies (memories of which I am not fond). It makes me wonder why mental illnesses the director suffers, because I suspect these struggles bleeding into the movie.",1479945600,,2267,4.6138613861386135

4297587,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Say what you will (Disney = moneygrubbers, Johnny Depp = washed up), but one of the most recent and fun franchises around is the Pirates of the Caribbean series. On Stranger Tides continues the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, picking up from what was alluded to at the end of At World's End. We get to see the irrepressible Capt. Hector Barbossa, this time ""in the services of"" King George as a privateer (spoiler alert, once a pirate, always a pirate) as well as Mr. Gibbs and a couple of returning His Majesty's Royal Navy officers (RIP). Definitely not my favorite in the series (that'll always be Curse of the Black Pearl), but a worthy addition to the series.

4297655,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I wasn't sure I'd want this sequel. The 3rd movie nearly did me in for the entire series, but pirates, man. They get me every time. I blame it on growing up and riding the ride at Disney back in the day.

I digress. I wouldn't say this movie was without its flaws, but I think it's a good starting point for a divergence of Jack--which is actually what I had originally WANTED with the actual sequel (#2, that is). We learn a lot about Jack in this movie. We learn a lot about the people around Jack as well. And we kind of get a sense for how he turned out to be like he is. Not everything, of course--Jack remains, still, quite the complicated fellow--but a lot.

And the rest of the characters, old (like Barbossa) and new (like our lovely love interest), are fantastic. My only complaint about the series is that they still enjoy telling without showing, and they rarely like telling you the whole back story.

But Jack still remains my favorite pirate, and that is, quite frankly, that. I'm actually looking forward to the next.",1468713600,6,1033,4.397905759162303

But ""On Stranger Tides"" is a real letdown. Not only because the only other member of the original characters (other than Sparrow) is Barbosa, but because Jack isn't quite his old self. He wears a messy, battered and nearly blond wig that looks awful - and he's no where near as much fun as he was in the other films. I shudder to think what ""Dead Men Tell No Lies"" will be like when it comes out in July 2017. That will make 14 years of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"".

4298200,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"I remember not thinking too much of this film when I first saw it in theaters. The story seemed to go nowhere. The characters had worn out their welcome. The ""Pirates"" brand was all but burned out.

Upon recent repeat viewings my opinion has somewhat changed. Ian McShane does a pretty good job with Blackbeard, and the dynamic with his daughter is fairly believable. In fact his introduction upon Queen Anne's Revenge is the highlight of the film. Johnny Depp does... What Depp does best: method acting ad infinitum. Geoffrey Rush continues to chew up the scenery in just about every scene he's in. You could argue it's just as much his movie as it is Depp's.

The special effects are pretty good and the movie looks good in 3d (I'm watching with active 3D). I think the movie tends to suffer in its third act where there is a lull where not much is accomplished. Also the music is pretty enjoyable, as is with most of the film's in the series. I think the movie could have benefitted with some more emphasis on the Inquisition but that's just me.

Overall not a terrible film but not great either. This is a solid Blu ray however with good audio/visual quality. I can't comment on the supplements. It's worth a watch if you enjoyed the other movies.",1461715200,3,1251,4.5265486725663715

4298270,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Having heard none of the bad reviews for this previously (and quite honestly forgetting it's existence entirely until last week) I was fully expecting to absolutely love this like I have the others...

What I got was crappy fanfiction.

What reason are we given to care about ANY of these characters, even/ especially the existing ones such as Barbossa, or even Jack himself?

Why are there suddenly so many bland, boring, uninteresting AF characters whose names no one even knows because by the time it's mentioned you're just blankly staring at the screen?

Are we actually supposed to care for Angelica or the Missionary (whose name is Phillip, which I only know because subtitles), or hell, are we even supposed to care for the mermaid past how beautiful she is?

Where has //my// Captain Jack Sparrow gone, my autistic Captain who managed to sway the hearts and loyalties all around him even as he snuck and danced around, managing to free or entangle our heroes from or in various near-death scenarios? Where is the Jack who would have suggested ""Y'know, why don't we just /ask/ the mermaid for her tears? Why not make a deal that is beneficial for everyone?"" Instead of standing by as a girl is tortured for a single teardrop. What exactly was the entire 15 minute thing with the cliff and the broken bridge? Who are we supposed to be rooting for in that final battle? Why even bother bringing in the Spanish fleet as villains if they have like, five minutes of screentime. I just... I do not understand how this movie was made, let alone how anyone could have standard to watch in theaters for the entire, dragging, 2 hours that seemed like 4, and not in the good way few movies achieve. I'm now regretting that I bought it instead of renting it, as I will absolutely never rewatch this which has effectively killed one of favorite movie series, and sincerely hope that no other movies are made after this-- something I would have been appalled to think just two and a half hours ago. The only redemption this movie could have in a sequel would be to retcon it as a dream Jack or Barbossa or whoever had while trapped chasing down the real fountain of youth...",1460851200,2,2168,4.62077922077922

The new characters and the addition of King George II, the mermaids, and a love interest for Jack Sparrow ( Excuse me, Captain Jack Sparrow) are unexpected, but I like them. I am biased because I like the other movies in the series, but this movie is so different that I would like it anyways. One of the best parts is in the beginning what Captain Jack is listening to King George. The king talks and talks of the fountain of youth and how he needs help from Captain Jack, who is annoying the king with his noisy handcuffs. When Captain Jack is free, all the viewers know that the shenanigans will begin. Another reason that this part is the best? Captain Barbossa is back. In my opinion, he is better in this movie, maybe because we see his soft side. The scene with the leaning ship is very exciting, and also the scene where Captain Jack climbs a coconut tree to escape the Spanish. Every scene that Captain Jack and Barbossa are in together is a great one. In general, this movie is amazing and I will watch it again.",1459728000,,1047,4.346938775510204

4298978,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"Right up front, I have to make an admission: This is a rather
difficult review to write.  You see, I was never a fan of the
Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.  While I certainly have
enjoyed its big-budgeted swashbuckling adventures of pirates
and treasure hunting -- I still have not come to terms with
Johnny Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow.  I find nothing
charming nor funny about this buffoon of a character who
basically spends the entire film mumbling through dialogue
to the point where he is basically incoherent.

Of course, my opinion of the Jack Sparrow character will not
be a popular one.  The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has
been a huge success for Disney, with this fourth installment
grossing $2.7 billion worldwide.  Not bad for a film series
based on a theme park ride.  Unfortunately, Disney continues
to capitalize on a franchise that ran out of steam long after
the first two installments.

In Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides we find Captain
Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his arch-rival Hector Barbossa
(Geoffrey Rush) in competition to find the lost fountain of youth.
Along the way Sparrow gets caught up with the notorious
Blackbeard (Deadwood's Ian McShane) and his manipulative
daughter, Angelica (Penelope Cruz).  Filled with enormous,
big-budgeted backdrop scenery, the action takes us through a
daring escape across the streets of London to a mutiny onboard
the Queen Anne's Revenge upon the high seas.

As with most of the Pirate films, the length of the movie seems
rather bloated, with lots of padding given to the film's action
sequences.  Really, the only real highlight of this film happens
halfway through in a sequence involving a group of enchanting,
but vicious mermaids.  It's enough to wake you from the blandness
that proceeds it, but unfortunately, the film struggles to regain
momentum moving forward.  To make matters worse, Jack
Sparrow isn't the only character mumbling through his dialogue.
The actors speak with such thick accents that it was necessary
for me to turn on the subtitles to understand what was being spoken.

The 1080p transfer is outstanding, for the most part.  Shot on
location in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, the gorgeous tropical locations
benefit from a detailed transfer that exploits its lush coloration.
Black levels are nice and deep, too.  No artifacts to be found
anywhere. Unfortunately, most of the films cinematography is
hampered by its many gloomy interior scenes.....

...which brings me to the 3D presentation.  It's almost pointless.
Because much of the film takes place in dull, low-light surroundings,
the presentation looks mostly flat.  It certainly won't help that on some
displays that don't properly compensate for dimming, glasses are going
to worsen the dulling effect.  Interestingly enough, I saw virtually no
introduction of ghosting which usually plagues films like these.
When the movie does open up to its bright, outdoor locales, there
seems to be a sense of depth, but it's quite minimal.

The film's ""In Yo' Face"" factor is reduced to a few gimmicky moments
that involve swords that slightly poke themselves out at the audience.
Meanwhile, there are so many lost opportunities with props that could
have easily been enhanced for the format including firing cannons and
a slithering water snake.  While some of the outdoor scenes are purposely
shot behind jungle foliage, the overall effect it provides is insignificant.

Perhaps this film's most notable feature is it's 7.1 DTS-HD track that
was downcoverted to 5.1 on my system.  This is a powerhouse of
a soundtrack that features an unbelievable amount of dynamic range
and sense of spatiality. The particular placement of surround activity
is just amazing to hear -- most evident in a scene aboard Ponce de
Le&ograve;ne's ship where the groaning and grunts of a vessel being kept
in balance creates an 360-degree soundfield that is quite impressive.
I was very pleased with the LFE activity here that underlines the
on-screen action and pounding drum score that accompanies it.

Pirates of the Caribean: On Stranger Tides arrives in a 5-disc
combo set that includes the 3D Blu-ray Feature Film, the 2D
Blu-ray Feature Film + Bonus, Blu-ray standalone bonus disc,
DVD Feature Film + Bonus and a Digital Copy of the Feature
Film.  All of this is housed in lenticular ""limited edition"" packaging.

This Limited Edition 5-disc Blu-ray combo pack includes hours
of bonus material that includes immersive Disney Second Screen
Technology, exclusive behind-the-scenes experiences, Fountain
of Youth mythology, an extensive look at mermaids, bloopers,
deleted and extended scenes (to name a few).

I should also mention that there are 3D trailers included for
John Carter and Cars 2.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is what I hope is a close
to a franchise that was worn out long ago.  Those that are tempted to
purchase this Blu-ray may not want to consider the 3D upgrade as it
really offers very little over its 2D counterpart.

Yes, it has some writing flaws. But it takes a lot of chances, and oftentimes big budget releases won't do that. I honestly didn't have any preconcieved notions about On Stranger Tides, but I was worried about the state of the franchise minus Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. All in all, I found this to be a fun offering. Did it continue in the epic tradition of the first three? Yes, but not entirely. I thought the love story arc, mixed with Jack Sparrow's comedy, overlayed with treasure, curses, famous ships, and a world in transition really made for a compelling narrative. One bright spot was Penelope Cruz. I thought she added a nice dynamic opposite Depp.",1450742400,2,837,4.5131578947368425

4299305,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Finally got around to watching this. I am pretty much squarely in the three star camp: I liked many things about the film, but thought it had several problems, too. A couple of random thoughts: What's with the light hair and orange-looking tan on Captain Sparrow? (I tried it on more than one device, and it looked like that on all of them.) It's distractingly odd looking, as if the costumers did not see the first three movies. If they did it on purpose for some reason, it didn't really work. They should have left his hair dark, but sprinkled in some gray and also added a touch of gray to his beard--he would look freaking awesome.

That leads me to my second thought: the characters and actors are aging and the movie should have embraced that more than it did, developing the theme, already alluded to several times in previous episodes, of a changing world and the approaching end of the pirate era. The conversation between Jack and Barbossa standing by the dead Kraken, Barbossa's comment about their sands running out, even the conversation between Jack and Gibbs on the beach at the end of this latest film (a very nice ending, by the way), are examples of things that could all be brought together more coherently and drive the plot, dialogue, and character's choices. We could use a few more quiet conversations and fewer sword fights on rafters. Jack Sparrow could continue to represent the desire for freedom and the view that it is selling out to embrace the colonial governments and corporations/trading companies just because they are on the ""winning side,"" but he could admit that his cause may be eventually lost. Don't we often admire those dedicated to a lost cause?

We'll see what they do with Pirates 5, but I hope it is not their intention to just keep going, like the James Bond franchise, replacing Johnny Depp (as if!) with new actors to play Jack Sparrow for years to come. Let's end the series with a little dignity.",1441497600,2,1948,4.659883720930233

4299330,1,B004A8ZWUQ,Not worth the rental fee.,1441152000,,25,4.2
4299331,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"This movie was obviously set up by the final couple scenes of At World's End, when they tease the Fountain Of Youth story.  This picks up at some point after with Jack and Gibbs in London, running into Barbossa, who now works for the crown.  They all end up in a race with Blackbeard and the Spanish to find the Fountain.  Intertwined in the story is Penelope Cruz's character who has a past both with Jack and Blackbeard.  Much of the cast from the original trilogy are not present in this movie (including Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly).  The main ""supernatural"" characters in this movie come in the form of mermaids, who appear about halfway in.

Overall, the film takes the darker tones from the second and third movies of the ""main"" trilogy.  While it does have some humorous and lighthearted moments, they are not as frequent as in the first film.  There are, of course, a lot of action sequences and CGI work.  The CG in the film looks great, but it does seem that they did what they could to build real sets so not everything was CG.  There was probably more suggested sexual content in this movie (although nothing overt) than in all the others.  Thankfully they kept the running time to just over 2hrs and it did not feel like it was dragging like At World's End seemed to.

For those that get the actual discs, this movie is the lightest on extras of all of them.  There is no separate disc with bonus features, everything is included on the movie disc.  The ""big"" extra is the ability to play the movie with the in movie experience that pops up windows throughout the movie that allow you to get a deeper insight into the film.  Then there is a blooper reel, a few deleted scenes and a few behind the scenes features.  Of course the movie looks and sounds great as you would expect.

If you are a big fan of all the Pirates movies, then this will be worth adding to your collection.  If you fall into the camp where you liked the first movie and started to get sick of them by the third one, then you are probably not going to like this enough to buy it.  There is not a ton of character development throughout the film, save for the few new characters that show up, but it mostly relies on the assumption you know who everyone is.  The story is good, but not as good or fun as in Curse of the Black Pearl, so if that is the only movie in the series you really liked then you may want to limit yourself to just having this on in the background.  Otherwise, I do think it is a worthwhile addition.",1441152000,,2511,4.3

It has a weak script which forces the actors to try to create interest in a stereo-typed fashion. 3D was OK but not that impressive.

4299826,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Let's face it, everyone goes to see the Pirates of the Caribbean movies for one reason - Captain Jack Sparrow.  And that's why, if Disney was going to continue the franchise, it made sense to relaunch it focused more on Jack.  And that's just what they've done with On Stranger Tides.  It still doesn't quite recapture the magic of the first one, but it's fun.

On story opens in London where Captain Jack (Johnny Depp) is surprised to learn that he is outfitting a ship with a crew for a new voyage.  Since Jack is currently without ship or crew, it's quite a shock.  Confronting the imposter, he learns it is Angelica (Penelope Cruz), a fling from his past.

Next thing Jack knows, he's been shanghaied on the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the pirate all pirates fear, Blackbeard (Ian McShane).  He is in search of the fabled fountain of youth and thinks Jack has a map.  To complicate things, the Spanish have also launched an expedition to find it, and the British have enlisted Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to claim it first.  Will any of these groups find the fountain?

Those hoping for lots of Captain Jack will be thrilled because this is his movie.  The scenes without him are few and far between.  Johnny Depp is in find form here and easily cares the move with his antics as the title character.

The movie feels like it has been pulled back from the wild excesses of the second and third in the series, which is a good thing.  Those movies, while they had their moments, felt more like excuses for special effects held together by the thinnest of plots.  Here, we actually get a coherent story again.  I wouldn't say the characters are fully developed, but they work for the piece.

My only real gripe with the film is the pacing.  It's over two hours, and it felt it.  Actually, I feel like they could have easily cut out the Spanish without changing much at all in the film.  A little more comedy might have helped as well.

While the special effects have been toned back, they are still present and very well done.  I had no trouble buying anything I saw on the screen.

The rest of the cast has a challenge making themselves obvious opposite Johnny Depp, and they do a good job.  In addition to Depp and Geoffrey Rush, Kevin McNally is also back as first mate Gibbs.  I had a lot of fun watching the three of them on screen again.  The new to the franchise cast brings their characters to life and make memorable contributions to the movie.  I will say I missed Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, but as the longer the movie went on, the less I even though about them.

In many ways, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a reboot of the franchise.  If you haven't seen the others, there is little here that will confuse you.  Yet if you are already a fan, you'll find yourself on another fun pirate ride.",1432166400,,2837,4.439922480620155

4299957,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"To begin with, I absolutely love the Pirates of the Caribbean series of movies and have watched On Stranger Tide probably two dozen times, if not more (I travel a lot). I ordered the 3D version after buying a Sony 65"" 3D 4K HDTV this month. Watching this movie in 3D was almost like watching for the first time. The majority of the movie was remarkable. There were parts that I paused and/or played in slow motion just to take it the effects.

I am very new to the 3D experience and to date have watched Avatar, Gamer and this movie on my TV. So far I have observed that scenes where the production crew had a camera in a fixed position have the best 3D effect. This movie has a lot of those making it a great experience. Movies like Gamer where the camera and the objects/people being filmed are moving degrade the 3D effect and make it hard for the eyes to keep up. Fast moving action scenes will lose some of the 3D effect but the majority of the movie was absolutely captivating.",1429315200,3,983,4.28494623655914

4300000,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"This fourth installment is a prequel.  Since that has never been done--ever...let me begin by explaining my expectations.  Prequels normally provide insight into the character that it is centered around.  The story follows that individual and you learn more about how he/she became the way he/she is in the other movies.

This story doesn't do that--we see Jack Sparrow doing most of his old tricks from the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, with little explanation of what is going on.  The plot is rushing from one thing to the next for two hours.

Wait I've logged in and written this review after waiting 5 minutes and its still not playing the movie.  What is Disney doing running a background check?,  Checking my credentials?  Reprogramming my Blu-ray player?  I might send this back.  Terrible terrible terrible.  I wonder how much more I could write while I'm waiting.  Lets see I'm running out of things to say.  But the movie isn't on yet so I might just keep going.  I'ld type faster but I'm fixing mistakes as I go.  No movie yet.  No movie yet.  No movie yet.  Get the picture.  Nope no picture either, no picture either, no picture yet no indication that anything is happening 10 minutes down and how many more.  Maybe I should get up and disconnect and start over and wait another 10 minutes for no movie.  I don't like blu rays.  I don't like blu rays.  I bet the dvd in the box won't make me wait this long.  How much better can the blu ray really be afterall.  Haven't given up yet.  No movie yet no movie yet no movie yet no movie yet no movie yet.  Ugh this is getting rediculous but I have a point to make and that is that whomever thought up this blu-ray you know what aught to be taken out and shot.  Yes this is terrible.  I've never had to wait this long before, or at least I don't remember waiting this long before.  Might as well give up.  Almost 15 minutes have gone by.  I wonder what happens when whatever this disk is doing doesn't work anymore.  Maybe this it huh?  Does anyone know how to fix this?

Argh.  no movie yet.  coming up on 20 minutes.  I give up.  Amazon's getting this back after I watch the dvd.",1424304000,,1723,4.209876543209877

The first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was, first and foremost, an adventure movie. Yes, it had dark elements; but it didn't take itself too seriously. The modern special effects and action sequences notwithstanding, it had the spunk and camp of old-school, classic pirate adventures like ""Treasure Island"" and ""Captain Blood."" The first two sequels on the other hand, ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End,"" abandoned all of that in favor of the ""darker and edgier"" style of storytelling that was all the rage in the mid-to-late '00s. Those sequels hardly even seemed to be about pirates; instead, the focus was on over-the-top green-screen monsters, whose victims sort of just happened to be pirates. Blech.

THIS movie on the other hand goes right back to the mood of the first one. It's got dark elements sure, but only for the sake of the moment; the green-screen monsters here are for the thrills, not to try and trick you into taking a pirate movie seriously. There is far more emphasis on the sword fights, the treasure hunts, mutinies, privateering, and, well PIRATEY stuff. Jack Sparrow is also back in character.  And the new villain, Blackbeard, is much more like a classic pirate villain than Davey Jones. But those are two points all on their own...

* Jack Sparrow is back in character

One thing that was so wrong with the last two sequels was how they butchered Jack's character. In the first movie Jack was a lovable rogue, a pirate who was self-serving when it came to superficial things like money, but heroic where it really mattered. The Jack Sparrow who dove into the water to save Elizabeth Swan from drowning would never have done or said half of the selfish, cowardly things they had him do in the second and third movies. In the first movie, a huge emphasis was put on the fact that Jack was ""a pirate...and a good man."" In ""Dead Man's Chest"" Jack has suddenly forgotten he's a good man, and is reduced to a flat ""bad guy who must learn to have basic morals"" cliche. Insulting.

""Stranger Tides"" is completely back on track with Jack's character. Sure he's self-serving when it comes to avoiding jail time and leaving his buddy Gibbs to rot in prison; but when he knows someone's life is on the line, Jack risks his own skin to do what's right. (I'm talking about the moment when Blackbeard demands, ""Who kept watch?"" and Jack quickly lies, in an attempt to protect an unnamed man, ""I did sir, I kept watch!"") The concern Jack shows for Angelica, as she's manipulated by her sociopath father Backbeard, is also much more on par with the Jack who was a quasi-mentor to Will Turner in the first movie.

* The villain is neither ""sympathetic"" nor green-screened.

Don't get me wrong; when done well, a sympathetic villain is great. But Davey Jones wasn't done well. I mean, come on... is angsting over a flighty girlfriend really supposed to make us sympathetic to a murderous villain? Pfft. And the gross tentacle face, just...no. A human face with real emotion and mannerisms ALWAYS makes a more compelling villain than a CGI effect.

Blackbeard is very much the new Barbossa of this movie. (Barbossa's in this movie, yes, but since he's given up villainy to be an antihero, someone else has to step up to bat.) Of course, Blackbeard isn't identical to Barbossa. Where Barbossa was wild-eyed and gruff, Blackbeard is slow and calculating. But like Barbossa in the first movie, Blackbeard is a cut-throat, merciless pirate, plain and simple. The movie even makes a theme out of Blackbeard's one-dimensional evil, with ""Not every villain can be 'saved.'""

This and the first movie are proof that one-dimensional villains are not always a bad thing. Because in real life, some people ARE just sociopaths. And if such evil can be portrayed by a great actor full of pizzazz, so much the better. These types of villains are a far better fit for a pirate franchise than the angsting, ""pity me!"" CGI monster we had in the last two sequels.

* It's its own story

A bad sequel takes a good movie that had perfect closure and says, ""Wait! Actually, that wasn't the end! The heroes DIDN'T get to live happily ever after, they had to suffer through two more movies worth of bulls***!"" A good sequel, on the other hand, says, ""Here's an example of some stuff that could have happened after that adventure."" It doesn't need to drag all of the main characters from the first movie back into another adventure. It doesn't feel the need to ""out-do"" the first movie, or ""continue"" the story. It just tells ANOTHER story, a DIFFERENT story.

""Stranger Tides"" leaves Will, Elizabeth, Port Royal, and even the Black Pearl behind. This movie focuses on a sort of space-race between England, Spain, and Blackbeard, to reach the Fountain of Youth. Other plot twists, like Angelica being manipulated by her father, Barbossa becoming a privateer, and a Christian missionary falling in love with a mermaid, are all a welcome change from Will and Elizabeth's tired love story. The one aspect of this movie that does seem very familiar is Barbossa's quest to avenge his (seemingly) lost ship. But instead of hoping the audience has amnesia, the movie twists the familiarity to it's advantage, creating a great moment where Jack to shows empathy for his old rival, as they're forced to team up against Blackbeard.

* A fresh cast

Like I said above, a good sequel doesn't try to force all of the same characters back into the fray. It brings back a few old characters, and introduces new ones, according to what fits the story. ""On Stranger Tides"" allows Will and Elizabeth to just live out the rest of their lives (finally). But since Barbossa and Jack are still playing tug-of-war over the Pearl, they're bound to cross paths again. And naturally, Jack's crazy schemes aren't much fun without Gibbs' apprehension.

Along with a new villain, this movie gives us new heroes (that is, straight-up good guys, to balance Jack's anti-hero antics), a new female lead, and new comic relief. All of which are improvements. I've already explained why Blackbeard is an improvement over Davey Jones. Angelica is a good, fresh female lead over Elizabeth, and Phillip and Syrena are a good new romantic pair, as opposed to bringing Will and Elizabeth back. (Will and Elizabeth were likable enough for the first movie, but their romantic bickering got old by movie 2. And besides, they had a perfect ending in the first movie; why couldn't the writers just let them be?) Angelica's fiery rage and wit were a welcome change from Elizabeth's posh practicality; and the missionary and the mermaid was an interesting romantic twist. Oh, and the comic relief? Forgive me, but Pintel and Ragetti got VERY repetitive in the sequels. I can only see so many fake-eye gags before it stops being funny. Stephen Graham's Scrum was yet another welcome change.

Oh, and the king. The late Richard Griffiths was HILARIOUS as King George. A One Scene Wonder if there ever was one!

* The soundtrack

As soon as the movie ended, my mom said, ""I WANT this soundtrack! I love that Spanish guitar!"" It's not often that I agree with my mother on something, and man is she right on this one. The soundtrack to this movie ROCKS.

* MERMAIDS

....are one of the most snubbed fantasy creatures in history. And on the rare occasion that they are used in cinema, they are all too often painted as one of two extremes; either all-innocent princesses like Ariel, or else straight-up monsters, like the ones seen in ""Harry Potter,"" or the 2003 version of ""Peter Pan."" As a hardcore mermaid fan, I highly approve of their portrayal in ""Stranger Tides."" They're not fully good or evil, just a force of nature that shouldn't be reckoned with. They're enchantingly beautiful, with eerily beautiful singing voices, but also deadly. Their magical powers are implied and hinted at, but never outright revealed, keeping them mysterious. Astrid Berges Frisbey and Gemma Ward are perfect as Syrena and Tamara respectively.

VERDICT:

A damn good sequel. In my personal canon, this is the ONLY sequel. I imagine that Will and Elizabeth lived happily ever after after movie 1, Jack never lost his soft side, and the two middle movies were just a drunken dream of Jack's. Granted, that would leave the question of how Barbossa came back from the dead, but who cares. Magic, scallywags.

With the announcement of a fifth movie though, I'm apprehensive. I only pray that the next movie doesn't go right back into the sequelitis...",1417564800,,8721,4.763419483101392

The special effects are great, the story-line is easy to follow. The mermaids are equally charming and horrific at the same time. I do not think I shall ever again ride the seas in a dinghy to a tendered ship without glancing warily at the waters below.

4301214,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"With so many sequels out there on films where I haven't even had the desire to see the original (Kung Fu
Panda? Really?), I was about to boycott all summer sequels. But I had to see Pirates of the Caribbean:
On Stranger Tides. When the first pirates came out in 2003, it was love at first ""arrrrgh!"" Depp was one of
the most endearing pirates ever as Jack Sparrow, and Geoffrey Rush was remarkable as Captain
Barbossa. To say it is one of my favorite pirate movies is an understatement. So when they produced a
sequel a few years later, I was excited--then terribly disappointed. The second installment and for that
matter, the third one which was released just one year later were scattered at best, stretching for a story
that just wasn't understandable or engaging. Terrible.
Now theres Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides. The premise is simple--Barbossa (now in
service to the King of England) and Jack Sparrow are in search of the Fountain of Youth. How to drink
from the Fountain is not so simple--and in that is where this film is redeemed. It would seem that the
producers of Pirates have decided to pull back, regroup, and keep the plot less complicated yet with the
same simple twists that made the first film so enjoyable. Add to the mix Ian McShane, who masterfully
plays the legendary Blackbeard, and you've got the makings of an installment finally worth (although not
fully comparable to) the original. Penelope Cruz is also new to the series, there isn't the same chemistry
between her and Depp as with former lead actress Kiera Knightley (who said that the franchise was
exciting at the time but behind her now).",1408406400,,1638,4.710801393728223

The hair and makeup were wrong, the lines and mannerisms were out of whack, everything.  Even the film quality seemed like it was done on a Flip camera or filmed with someone's iPhone.  Now, while I can normally get behind something that has an Indy-quality feel to it, the story itself was poorly written, the fight choreography was lousy (Medival Times does a better job) and the editing flat-out sucked.

This was not, mostly it seem to be a Blu-ray quality flick.  Sure there was a few scenes that were 3D but most of the rest was a disappointment to me.  A  3D movie must have all scenes in focus, if not, the 3D effect is gone.  This is an old movie and it was made by the technicians into a 3D movie, they fail by not trying to bring background and foreground in focus.  A better try to make a movie into 3D is Jurassic Park.

4301618,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"When I heard that they were making another pirates of the Caribbean movie, I new in the back of my mind that Disney couldn't come up with a new flagship movie in time to replace Pirates, so they decided to stretch out this movie further than should have and it shows.

First off it's painfully slow and it seems very disjointed at times, also they don't give you enough of a reason to care for any of the characters. Jack has run his course and his drunkin personality is getting real old now, Angelica, the love interest for Jack is a very boring character and only serves to cause sexual tension, and Blackbeard is your average sociopathic antagonist with no personality. The leader of the Spaniards was more interesting than the entire cast combined, and they were only on screen for like 15 minutes!

The story was absolutely pointless, it adds nothing to the series. Just a bunch of random escape scenes, mosh pit battles, and dialogue that has been overused way too many times by Barbosa and Jack.

All in all, this is an average popcorn flick, rental at best. At worlds end was a perfect conclusion to the series in my opinion.",1395360000,,1134,4.549019607843137

While this movie had potential you just don't care about the new characters.  Really there is a cleric that travels with Black Beard who falls in love with a mermaid who tries to eat him.  Not exactly a plot that keeps you wanting more.  There's no more Orlando Bloom or Kiera Knightly.  My main complaint about this film is how dark it is.  Dark in that there is very little light for you to see the characters through half or more of the movie.  I would suggest you watch another movie as you'll likely be disappointed with this one.

4301692,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"The usual Johnny Depp humor and Disney special effects, but I really enjoyed the inclusion of the subplot between the gallant young missionary and the helpless captive mermaid! It was refreshing to see some references to a moral God and the struggle between good and evil. It seemed almost historical rather than the usual Hollywood moral vacuum. The selfless young hero was a welcome contrast to the jaded and self absorbed main character. The well developed theme of mermaids taken from maritime lore was fascinating, but it could be frightening to younger children. This is not the ""H2O Just Add Water"" variety of mermaid. This set it apart from all the others and made it my favorite of the whole Pirates of the Caribbean series!",1395014400,,733,4.872

4301697,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"So far as 3D and sound quality is concerned, this movie is great. I would spend $13-$16 for a movie for either one of those qualities alone. However, the movie itself is.. Well, it's not the best of all of the Pirates films. It's missing a lot of the characters that viewers have come to expect to see (two main ones, specifically) and is really focused on Jack Sparrow.

Movie 2/5
3D 5/5
 - pop out effects: A few scenes that swords come out of the screen at you, etc.
 - Depth: Amazing depth to the pictures
sound 4/5
 - I am almost always very impressed with Disney's ability to uniquely use all of the speakers in a sound system. During scenes with singing, etc. the sound envelops you and you get it from all angles. Additionally, the LFE is well used and  adds a lot to the film.
overall 3.75/5

Like I said, for the value it's a good buy. It's pretty much the cost of a single movie ticket. So, with that in mind if you are looking for a a cool soundtrack that utilizes all of your speakers well, and some pretty great 3D visuals then you'll be happy.

4301742,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"The movie opens with Mr. Gibbs from the first three movies on trial for the crime of being Captain Jack Sparrow. In a surprising twist the judge turns out to be Jack himself in a thinly veiled disguise. So how is it that nobody knows what the actual judge looks like including the other magistrates sitting around him and the dozens of people in the courtroom? This scene really sums up the movie for me. The first three films by Gore Verbinski were silly and over the top but generally fun. On Stranger Tide is often just dumb.

That is in no way meant to say the Verbinski films were perfect. They most assuredly were not. In particular I felt the series ruined the Elizabeth Swann character by making her the toughest pirate captain sailing the seas. Verbinski, however, was able to keep the action fun and inventive and he was helped enormously by the great cast. It felt like the new director Rob Marshall was desperately trying to emulate Verbinski with much weaker results. The first escape sequence by Jack Sparrow may be the worst in the whole series. The fight between Jack and and his  doppleganger in the kitchen (???) seemed like a direct rip off of the first fight between Jack and Will Turner in the smithy house except not nearly as well done. There was a fight between the captive crew and Blackbeards zombies on the Queen Anne's Revenge that felt like it was a replay of the fight on the Pearl in the first movie. And I didn't like either fight. The great irony is that this weak imitation, which stands as easily the most poorly rated in the series, was the second highest grossing of the four films and 12th highest grossing film of all time.

The action is often quite daft. In one scene Jack Sparrow is tied to a coconut tree with about thirty yards of thick rope and manages to shimmy his body up to the top of the tree. He's show rising from the top of the tree which wouldn't work because he would have gotten caught up in the branches being tied up and all, He then ties the rope around a coconut and gets it to wrap around another coconut tree about 50 feet away and begins bending the tree with an inhuman level of strength. When the tree snaps back Sparrow is sent flying through the air like a Loony Tunes cartoon and for all the effort it only gained him about 30 yards which he could have just walked. There were a lot of silly over the top action sequences in the previous 3 movies but Verbinski managed to keep them fun whereas in this film they're either poor copies of better actions sequences or just dimwitted.

Perhaps the biggest problem in the film is how ill defined the characters are. Philip Swift seems like the replacement for Will Turner but with none of Turner's charm. Swift's love interest is a mermaid who we're supposed to feel sorry for having been abducted by Blackbeard except the film already established that mermaids true appearances are hideous and they drag men to their deaths, The movie can't seem to decide whether Angelica, played by Penelope Cruz's, is a master manipulator or kind hearted soul. Ian McShane is a fine actor and his initial introduction in the film is done well but his modest height hurts his physical presence and at 68 when the film came out he has a rather old and sleepy appearance. I'm a big fan of Geoffrey Rush but his Captain Barbossa just seems tired and they piled on pancake make for no apparent reason.

The flim ends as nonsensically as the rest of the film. Characters act with seemingly random motivation as if the writers just decided it would be cool if a character did something regardless if it made any sense. Despite the astronomical box office take the series simply has not set itself up for future success. I have a feeling the next flim will feel the brunt of this one and if Johnny Depp were to leave the series would be dead. There are some beautiful scenes in the movie. This is one of the most expensive movies of all times and it looks good but to spend so much money around such a dumb plot is painful. I didn't hate this movie and I watched it twice for this review but it is by far the weakest of the four Pirates movies.",1393372800,,4136,4.42257217847769
4301743,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"None of the follow up movies to the original Pirates are as good, but they are still better than most of the movies out there.  And they all have Johnny Depp it them, so what's not to like.",1393286400,,189,3.973684210526316
4301744,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I loved the first movie.  But was somewhat unhappy with the second, because it felt unfinished being that it was the first of a two part.  And the third one, while having some scenes that did WOW me, also felt unfinished and unpolished.  On Stranger Tides, partly based on a very good pirate novel, had many factors that I enjoy in the movie.  First, it was a full story.  Second, adventure, action, a story without leaning too heavily on special effects.  It also had a touch of mystery and fantasy, with the search for Voodoo, the Fountain of Youth, and mermaids.
Why one star gone?  Well, I had nothing against Penelope Cruz who came across as both beautiful and dangerous, Ian McShane as Blackbeard just seemed too...small for the part?  Edward Teach, good or bad, is seen as a cutlass carrying giant in Pirate lore, and here he comes across as a smooth talking con artist.
I did enjoy the race between the English and the Spanish to find and claim the Fountain.  And the interaction between Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa, played by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush.  But Blackbeard is a major character and Mr. McShane just did not seem to fill the huge boots of that character.

4301746,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"Lacked the fun and adventure of the original trilogy. Felt thrown together and written over a weekend. The parts I COULD follow were so disjointed they didn't make any sense and I hardly found myself laughing at any of the attempts at humor. It felt like diet Pirates of the Caribbean where the sword fights were on solid ground instead of giant wheels rolling through the forrest, horrible sea creatures were hot women with sometimes visible flippers instead of enormous ship-devouring tentacle beasts, and the scary boat full of undead pirates were just men with weird bumps on their skin instead of being made out of various fish parts or turning to skeleton in the moonlight. It was all like they took the wow factor out of all the elements from the originals then slapped the same name on it. And even tho they tried to shift the main character to Jack Sparrow after losing Will and Elizabeth,  he still played like a sidekick to the story and thus leaving the movie with no clear hero or villain to root for or against. By the end, I really didn't care who won or died and the worst part is it left the ending unfinished and open ended, yet I have no desire to see it through. SPOILER: The only person I cared about even just a little was the Christian boy who fell in love with the mermaid, and they don't explain at all what happens to him. In fact that relationship was so rushed that I didn't know what to think by the end to even wager a guess of his outcome. Did she save him? Did she turn him into a merman? Did she drown and eat him and was misleading him the whole time? Any are possible because I have nothing to go on.",1393200000,,1635,4.3257328990228014

They aren't great, but compared to what passes for 80% of what is cranked out of Hollywood today they are reliably entertaining.  I have this on in Blue-ray and it is quite something to see.  Depp is his usual self and I guess he must like what he does with another installment due out in the early summer of 2015.  I may wait on that one...",1392595200,,469,4.284090909090909

4301791,5,B004A8ZWUQ,I give this 5 stars but I love Depp and all the Pirate movies. This movie only disappoints because it is missing some characters from the past.

4301792,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"We love all of the ""Pirates"" movies, and although we initially missed some of the original characters, after watching this movie several times we thoroughly enjoy these characters. We also like how Disney can make a great movie with typically rough, hard characters, and while you know some are the ""bad"" guys, not a single ""bad"" or foul word was needed to make that point.",1392163200,,373,4.753846153846154

4301797,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"They should have stopped at three,  with the original cast.  Penelope Cruz  was terrible casting.  The movie's  only redeeming factor was  Black Beard and the mermaids.  The plot and storyline were poor, but Black Beard's lines were eloquent and brought an element of class that the movie otherwise lacked.  The special effects on the mermaids were well done.  Unfortunately the jokes and scenes were not original. I enjoyed the first and third movie in this series...but the second and fourth just didn't live up to the hype.",1391817600,,526,4.954022988505747

4301799,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"ORIGINAL REVIEW: 1/5: ""Rating is for Disney, not the movie itself.  While other studios are generous with digital copies being of HD quality, Disney continues to be unbelievably cheap with SD quality digital copies (as was the case with the digital code for this movie).  Unless a Disney movie states clearly that the digital code is HD, I will not purchase it.  Also, in protest, I will NEVER purchase a digital copy of a Disney movie on iTunes or anywhere else.  Disney is obviously hoping you will buy the same movie in several different formats just to make their cash register ring.  How greedy can you get.  Good thing Disney lags almost all major studios these days on the quality of their movie offerings.  If it wasn't for Marvel movies, Disney would be stone dead in the business world of quality movie production.""

UPDATED REVIEW AS OF FEB. 25, 2014: 5/5: ""Today, Disney launched DisneyMoviesAnywhere.  When I registered at that site and linked that site with my iTunes account, it not only gave me ""The Incredibles"" in HD for free, but it also upgraded to HD the following Disney digital movies which I had in my iTunes account in SD format: (1) this movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides; (2) Marvel's Iron Man 2; and (3) Marvel's The Avengers.  Also, when I entered the Disney Movie Rewards codes for Alice in Wonderland, Tron: Legacy and the Lone Ranger on Disney's new site, it automatically gave me the HD versions of those movies, whereas, before, I was unable to redeem such codes using iTunes (the digital codes for the first two movies had expired long ago and the digital code for The Lone Ranger was redeemed on vudu.com and did not work on iTunes).  The bottom line is that Ultraviolet has really taken off and UV digital codes very frequently redeem in full HD, not SD like Disney previously did through iTunes.  Disney and Apple apparently have teamed up and have decided to jointly promote an aggressive alternative to UV.  We customers are the beneficiaries of this competition.  Since I now have this Disney movie in HD in iTunes, I am once again a happy customer and, for that reason, revised my rating accordingly.  HINT: You may need to ""sign out"" of your iTunes account on your iPad and then sign back in for your linked ""SD"" Disney movies to appear in iTunes in an upgraded HD format.""",1391558400,5,2333,4.669926650366748
4301800,5,B004A8ZWUQ,Been looking for a great deal for this movie to complete my collection of the series.  Can't beat this deal.  Love this movie.,1391472000,,126,4.434782608695652
4301841,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"This movie felt like the writers were rushing to squeeze out one more pirates movie as quickly as possible. They could have made another movie explaining things like how Barbosa lost his leg, and how Black beard captured the black pearl. It looked like they were trying to get a romance between the missionary and the mermaid, but they rushed the plot along and didn't develop the charecters enough to make it work. Most of the new actors couldn't act. They would be better suited to Power Rangers or comunity theater.",1391385600,3,518,4.7032967032967035
4301842,5,B004A8ZWUQ,Disney could not have made a better choice for Captain Jack. Johnny Depp OWNS the part. Can't wait for the next installment!,1391299200,,124,4.681818181818182

4301844,5,B004A8ZWUQ,I have followed Jack Sparrow since the beginning. I absolutely enjoy watching the entire Pirates series. Barbosa and crew were equally as entertaining as the new members. Great job!,1391212800,,181,5.275862068965517
4301845,5,B004A8ZWUQ,This is a awesome movie. I love the character of Jack sparrow. It was awesome to see the character again. He makes the movie and the story was awesome as well.,1390953600,,159,4.161290322580645
4301846,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Because it cuts many times during the streaming of the movie , and my internet speed it is good !",1390953600,,97,3.9

4301849,5,B004A8ZWUQ,Great film. Strays away from the others by adding new characters and historical figures. The story is still very good.,1390521600,,118,4.95

I needed this dvd to complete my Pirate collection I have all 4 Movies : Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest,Pirates of the Caribbean the Curse of the Black Pearl,Pirates of the Caribbean At World's End and this one Pirates of the Caribbean on Stranger Tides. Each one was better than the last! This one had mermaids and Penelope Cruz great addition to my collection! Who doesn't like a good Pirate movie yoho matey!",1390262400,,512,4.576086956521739

4301883,3,B004A8ZWUQ,I think they just made this movie in the intent on just making money.  It almost seemed like they came up with the idea over a one day period.  They wasn't much creativity or excitement like in the other Pirates movies.  Another big thing about the movie that most people will not like is Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Swann)  Those were both two of my favorite characters in the movies and they were not in On Stranger Tides.  Over all it was an ok movie.  I did not hate it or love it.,1390176000,,515,4.257731958762887
4301884,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"This series is just a classic. Who does not like pirate films? Adventure and discoveries of treasures in the Caribbean seas?

4301890,3,B004A8ZWUQ,I heard from the guys at oneofus.net that this movie was a good addition to the pirates of the Caribbean films and they were right i bought it as a christmas present for a friend and we really enjoyed it. It does drag a bit getting to the climax where the other movies usually have more fun getting to their big mystical place du jour but i really enjoyed being able to see jack sparrow on at least one more adventure. A solid buy if you are dieing for more jack.,1389225600,,463,4.0989010989010985
4301901,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"I love the movie, but was disappointed about how scratched my used copy was. About 1/4 of the way into the film the disc started to skip every scene and it was too bothersome to continue watching. However, I was watching it with a DVD player at the time so I'm sure it'll work just fine on my laptop... it always seems to be the case that even discs that don't work very well in a DVD player play just fine on my computer.",1389225600,,422,4.035714285714286
4301902,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"It was a good movie, but not quite as action packed as the previous in the story line. Worth it.",1389225600,,96,3.85
4301903,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I chose a four star rating because this movie is a great blend of action, comedy, adventure, and mystery. Although, I did only four stars because the first half of this movie is basically only about some sword fighting, and explaining the Fountain of Youth. Once you get past all of the explanations though, this is a great movie that includes mermaids, holy water, Blackbeard and Barbosa's ways, and even some history related topics! The British were trying to get to the fountain before the Spanish, so for people who like a little twist of history, this is good.
I liked how they related this movie to history a little bit, and incorporated the pirates cleverly, except the first half, saturated with explanations, was somewhat of a disappointment. I would recommend this product to people twelve, thirteen, fourteen years of age. It is quite descriptive sometimes, except it's filled with good action later. It's probably too violent or graphic for younger kids. My ten year old sister watched it with me, and vowed it was the worst pirate movie out of all four just because of the frightening mermaid scene. (She got quite scared.)
I would say this movie is second best to Curse of the Black Pearl out of the four movies. This movie was a little bit more boring at the beginning, but in the middle of the second half, it definitely met my expectations. For a teenager who is looking for a movie with a variety of entertainment possibilities, this is good, but be careful of youngsters watching this.",1389225600,2,1504,4.744274809160306

4301942,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I was disappointed with this addition to the franchise as we are left with Jack and Barbosa of the main characters. An Infamous pirate takes the role of the antagonist as Jack continues his search for immortality. The story is alright, but it seems to be more comical than action as Jack is not serious enough to keep your attention. I hope the next film will be better",1388793600,,369,4.4411764705882355

4302002,4,B004A8ZWUQ,It is definitely worth owning. It is still entertaining and Johnny depp as always does a great job of being captain jack sparrow. So if you like the pirates collection I suggest you still give this one a shot. If you haven't seen any of them I suggest that you start with this one then watch the first three in sequence.,1388016000,,320,4.262295081967213

4302009,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Given the silly script, fairly flimsy plot and some questionable acting I can enjoy the films. Well I did find some joy in the first two, but that third movie seems to be the problem child for most series. Either way this movie diverts from the previous films in terms of overall production. It seems really stiff and thrown together. They had a great actor, Ian McShane, and they still couldn't give him any compelling dialogue or redeeming qualities. Cruz's character seems to have undying loyalty for a father who shows no flicker of love or affection yet she's willing to risk her life and curse jack for saving it in spite of her father. The comedy is force and sparse, the fight scenes are half hearted and the mysteries are just splayed out instead of slowly revealed. Like me and probably most rational people this series seems exhausted mentally and sometimes physically. It's no wonder that Bloom and Knightley didn't sign on for it. Depp clearly just has some secret pact with disney that he can't or won't opt out of seeing as he appears in another blunder in The Lone Ranger. Ultimately it's a fruitless endeavor even if what you're looking for, and I was, a cheap pirate laugh with some entertaining back and forth while swashbuckling. Just rewatch the first two and go play Black Flag. (Or watch Muppet Treasure Island because Tim Curry is 5x the pirate these guys are)",1387324800,6,1384,4.676229508196721

Some people can't resist that screeching but slap the head of a sea witch with a bottle of rum and you'll be fine.

This one was good, but I missed the original actors from the first three; especially Keia Knightley and Orlando Bloom since they were key characters. This one was a bit more serious/heavy; didn't have the same lightness and level of humor as the first three. Johnny Depp is excellent and consistent as Capt. Jack Sparrow. I think the other original actors fed into that fun atmosphere he's so talented at creating that the actors in this movie weren't able to do.

4302134,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I enjoy the Captain Jack movies. This tale is just as entertaining as the rest. Fun characters, crazy antics and just over the top entertainment.

As far as the 3D goes, it is hit and miss. Overall it is a solid 3D post convert however the first third of the movie has decent depth but not much in the way of any thing popping out at you. Which I expected since there was a horse carriage chase scene with fire, explosions and debris everywhere but none of that debris really came popping out at you. The best 3d moment is on Black Beard's ship when he points the sword straight at the screen and starts controlling the ship, also when Penlope Cruz's character threw a sword through the door on Black Beard's ship. Those are your two really great 3D parts, the last half or third of the film with the mermaids and the island jungle has some really good depth on the foliage and the final scene in general.

Overall a Good movie with mostly average 3D that has two really good pop out moments.",1383264000,3,992,4.327956989247312

4302136,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"I enjoyed the original Pirates trilogy but could not shake the impression that the latter two films were written on the fly. That does not appear to be the case with the present film however. It approaches the first film in the quality of script and tight story telling.

All the elements that make the Pirates movies so enjoyable are present. There is a ton of madcap action, supernatural thrills, and wonderfully likeable characters. The mermaid hunt/attack scene is the highlight here with the contrast between the beauty and ferocity of the mermaids being delightfully creepy. On the other hand I'm not really sure I understood what was going on with that whole mermaid Spider-Man webbing thing. Only a handful of the characters from the original trilogy return. Of course, you can't have a Pirates movie without Johnny Depp playing Jack Sparrow. The new characters did not entirely come up to the level set by the originals. Ian McShane made a fine villain but the gorgeous Penelope Cruz is not really an adequate successor to Keira Knightly as a female lead.

Highly recommended. If you liked the original trilogy or even only the first one you'll probably like this one too. Be sure to watch through the credits for the sequel hook at the end.",1383004800,,1250,4.809302325581395

When Pirates 4 came out, there seemed to be a lot of that.  It was either the worst thing Johnny Depp has ever pranced across, or, at least, so much better than the last couple of sequels.  Well friends, I come to make a declaration: It was okay.  As a big budget blockbuster with a some laughs and derring do, the movie works just fine.

Is it amazing?  Not really.  I really dig Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.  He clearly has a lot of fun with the role and is a great character to watch.  That said, Captain Jack is not the sort of character that needs to carry the movie.  Sure, he can carry it based soley on his charisma, but as far as how big a role he plays, he works a little better in smaller doses.

Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley aren't around for this adventure, so Captain Jack is the man.  A missionary named Phillip is there to presumably take on the Will Turner-esque role, but other than simply to shoe-horn a romance between him and the mermaid; he doesn't add much to the proceedings.  Yes, a movie like this full of scalawags and scoundrels needs a character that provides a moral center to the movie, but Phillip could be removed from the flick and it would not change anything.

The action itself is fine and full of swashbuckling fun. Yet I just couldn't help but notice a lack of sizzle and panache to the set pieces that Gore Verbinski brought to the original three Pirate movies.  They are exciting, but not quite as inventive as some of those great sequences.

All that said, I did enjoy the movie.  The one problem I had with the original Pirate movies was that there's a bit of bloatedness about them.  Especially the third one.  This one is way more straightforward and I really appreciated that it felt like more of a self-contained adventure that's not tripping over itself to set up sequels.

The storyline is interesting enough.  I always enjoy the search for lost treasures and artifacts and the search for the Fountain of Youth is always good for this type of genre. They have a lot of fun with it and the twists and turns are clever, as is a good deal of the dialogue.

I really like the cast of these movies.  Captain Jack, as always, is a pleasure, even if he shouldn't be carrying the film.  It's always good to see master Gibbs and Captain Barbossa is always a blast.  These movies would not be the same without him.  As for the newcomers, Penelope Cruz I can take or leave.  I've never quite gotten the love for her, but whatever.  She's fine here.  Blackbeard is a nice addition to this motley cast of misfits and is adequately intimidating and evil; thought not quite as to the level of Davy Jones in Dead Man's Chest.

It's not great, but it's not horrible either.  It's a perfectly fine adventure film that's perfect for a lazy Saturday afternoon.  There's enough fun and interesting ideas in the movie to keep it afloat (so to speak), but it just doesn't quite reach the heights of something more memorable.  The blu-ray looks and sounds great and I don't regret having a copy sitting on the shelf to throw in when I'm in the mood for some Captain Jack.",1379548800,,3236,4.403035413153457

The movie is quite boring overall as some others say. Johnny Depp's still doing his crazy hand waving and goofy looks...I guess that's something for the ladies. Otherwise, the film lacks some of the endearing characters from the former movies, and while the costumes and cinematography are great as ever, the story and scenery just isn't as gripping and epic as 1 and 2 (again, I haven't seen 3). Seems to me they're just milking the franchise at this point, putting out crappy stuff and riding on the brand like so many other companies do these days.

Even the third one ""At Worlds End"" which also received many negative reviews for it being lost and too weird i also loved. Now on to the fourth installment, ""On Stranger Tides"". Anyone who is an avid fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean series like myself will almost with out a doubt like this movie. It takes off right where the third film left off, and it follows in the same vain of the previous films. Lots of action and witty comedy for you to enjoy. Even though Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are absent from this film, i have to say they aren't missed. Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane do a great job, both feel like they fit right in with the story, and Bloom and Knightly are forgotten about within about a few minutes of watching this film. Now the reason for the above title ""A good continuation."" Is because this movie seems like it's more of a bridge towards the next film, which has just been recently announced. It feels more like just a side story so everyone can get caught up with whats going on in the main story line. But that being said it's a very good and very well thought out side story. And it definitely fits in the series. All in all this is a great film, and a must watch for anyone who loves the Pirates series.",1373932800,,1406,4.25

These movies have all been entertaining and fun but I'm afraid none compare to The Curse of the Black Pearl.  The greatest surprise was the absolutely perfect rendering of the mermaids.  The make-up, costuming, and story line are fantastic for these creatures.  I'd watch it again just to see them!  Jack's father reappears and is just what you'd expect from a relative of Captain Jacks.",1373846400,,564,4.8125

It had great action, fun twists and incorporated the old tales of mermaids and the Fountain of Youth in an exciting way. We enjoyed all the side stories going on along beside the main plot, and really loved Penelope Cruz! There were lots of laughs as well as moments of unexpected sweetness. Make sure to watch all the way down past the last of the credits for an extra treat that brings closure to the plot yet leaves the door open for more adventure!",1373500800,,527,4.387755102040816

4302451,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Just finished watching this film and as an overall feeling it was good.  Personally I didn't think it was a good as the original PoTC but it held it's own.  I didn't think it was quite as jovial as the other films in the series but I don't think it was meant to be.
I was a little disappointed in a couple spots like when the mermaid transforms and it's done with just a simple look one angle and then poof she just has transformed, I expected a bit more there but it's a minor thing really.  The whole scene on Balboa's ship was somewhat funny yet, my mind kept wondering if the balance had to kept so equal how did Captain Barbossa get there and not tip it over...
Anyway a good film that kept my attention for the 2 hours it ran and the time did seem to fly by which means it must have been a good film and other than a few loose ends, which I hope will be addressed in a later film, it was satisfying.",1373068800,,905,3.9889502762430937

4302455,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"The wife, like MANY wives, is somewhat of a fan of Mr. Depp.  So when this movie came out in 3D, we had to purchase it.

So the good:  it's a solid 3D experience, and the sound is excellent.

The not so good:  it's a bit darker in it's overtones, which affects 3D quality somewhat.  It's good, it's just not great.

The sound helps make that up, and if you're a series fan (or have a wife who drools over...er...is a fan of Johnny Depp) then this is absolutely worth purchasing.",1372204800,,478,4.186813186813187

First view of London, Jack in court, jack in the king's palace, Jack making an escape in a horse cart, at The Captain's Daughter pub, at the dock, then trying to organize a mutiny on Blackbeard's boat... ulp! Great Keith Richards cameo - ""Does this face look like it's been to the Fountain of Youth?"" - although it's not as good as the one in Part 3 when he plays the guitar dramatically. Great drunken Captain Jack Sparrow - ""I can name fingers and point names."" Cool interaction with Penelope Cruz. ""I'm your first mate."" ""Was I your first? I've often wondered."" Black Pearl in a bottle now - complete with monkey. ""I still hate that monkey!!""

""The lies I told you were not lies.""
""You lied to me by telling the truth? That's very good. May I use that?""

Strange plot, strange alliances, strange zombie crew (the quartermaster, a white zombie). Freaky battles with mermaids. Weird moment when the Fountain of Youth sucks the life out of Edward Teach. Priest is killed again and again - three times? Christ-like, I guess. Last word of the film: ""Savvy?""

Watch to the end of the credits - there's a missing scene - Jack's voodoo doll washes up on the island Penelope Cruz was stranded on. Ha ha!! Bloopers scenes, not so great, although one where Depp uses the sword to remove Cruz's tri-corner hat is kind of funny...",1372032000,,1429,4.5310077519379846

4302568,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"It's Captain Jack. It's fun. His plots are brilliant, as always. But it just wasn't up to par with the earlier films, IMO. The climax was predictable, much moreso than the other films. The bad guys weren't as impressive, though I did like the friend/foe relationship between Jack and Barbossa and the mermaid with the missionary. I wish I'd seen more of the latter at the end of the movie, personally.  Unlike the earlier movies, I probably wouldn't purchase this one, but I would rent it (and did).",1370390400,,499,4.670454545454546
4302569,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Remember watching those old silent movies with the overacting and that continuous
perpetual music in the background?  Well, that describes this movie.  There was
hardly a moment or a scene that did not have continuous, over-the-top, unnecessary music.

It distracted from the dialog and took away from the mirth of many scenes.  I felt I as if
I had gone to a concert starring a symphony orchestra instead of watching a movie.  Music
is like seasoning...you have to add just the right amount--just enough to please the palate--
over season the food and the entire meal is ruined.

So it was with this film.  The excessive score took hold of the reins and left the actors,
the cinematography and everything else one could have enjoyed, behind.  If you pay attention
some of the best scenes are the ones without any music and those lasted perhaps a moment to a minute.
The mermaid scenes almost salvaged the poorly written, too fast, and senseless script. One had no
time to digest what was transpiring.  That's what Hollywood does when they've got a bad
script...next scene, next scene, next scene etc...And before you know it, the movie is over
and you're attempting to remember exactly what it was you just watched on the big screen.
It's very reminiscent of a fast-talking salesman, who doesn't give you a moment to consider what he's just poured
out.

And why bring back Geoffrey Rush--wasn't he killed in the first movie?
Are there not countless actors with great talent who could have played that role?
Unfortunately, Hollywood is a closed circuit...the same actors over and over and over again.
Hollywood has lost it.  They've lost the art of movie making.",1370304000,,1662,4.837455830388692

It feels like they added her so they could keep eye candy available and not so they could add an engaging new character.

4302657,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"First of all, the first three films of the POTC series rank up as one of the best trilogies ever. Most people will pick the original Star Wars as the best, & no doubt, they are great films. To me, I enjoy the POTC films more. Just my preference...with this in mind, doing a new follow up without Orlando & Keira involved is a tough job. The film manages nicely, though it's nowhere as great as the previous three films.

This is basically an all new adventure for Captain Jack Sparrow, as some familiar faces do show up, such as Barbossa & Gibbs. The main villain is Blackbeard, played well by Ian McShane.

I don't want to give away spoilers, but it's a three party search for the mythical Fountain of Youth, and as usual, not all is as it seems.

If you enjoyed Depp's turn as the comical, yet unusual pirate captain, you should like this just fine...though you will miss The Turners.",1367452800,,886,4.390243902439025

4302681,5,B004A8ZWUQ,Love the Pirates of the Carribean ride at Disneyland.  These movies take that fun ride and moves it into a great story series.  I have all discs of the series not only for my own enjoyment but also for my grandkids.  even the ones not even born yet :),1366675200,,251,4.081632653061225
4302682,2,B004A8ZWUQ,I did not exactly enjoy this movie. I found myself getting bored and finding reasons to leave the room and actually even read a book during a bit of the movie. I was hoping for a better conclusion to the original story line and was disappointed.,1366588800,,245,4.3478260869565215
4302683,5,B004A8ZWUQ,This movie is great for anyone who likes Pirates of the Caribbean or Johnny Depp in his funniest roles of his movies,1366502400,,116,4.318181818181818
4302684,3,B004A8ZWUQ,Was good but not as good as the others in the series. A few holes in the plot but not game changers.,1366416000,,100,3.590909090909091

4302686,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"The story got off to a really slow start which lost my interest almost immediately. There seemed to be a lack of energy in the acting in the first 30 minutes of the film which improved by the end. There were some interesting new characters introduced, but there was something lacking in the believe-ability of the characters and a choppy story line did not help. There were some highlights. I did enjoy the mermaid scenes, the mermaid lore and the realism of the mermaid costumes. The ending did not make a bit of sense -- kind of felt like they put a period in the middle of a sentence that really needed a comma.",1366329600,,614,4.394736842105263
4302687,5,B004A8ZWUQ,Another Great installment of the series! Johnny Depp & the rest of the cast give awesome performances! Always fun and lots of action!,1366156800,,133,4.826086956521739
4302708,5,B004A8ZWUQ,Would not have purchased this if I didn't love it. Asking someone to rate purchases like this is kind of senseless . . . . 99% of others may not like anything I like . . . . .,1366156800,,175,3.5128205128205128
4302709,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"OK, I ordered this used (Used, Like New condition), and what I received was the 3D blu ray disk, and nothing else.  It came in a cheap Walmart blue case, no original packaging and no other disks.  Since it said it was a 5 disk combo, and I received one, I will be returning this and getting a refund.  Beware when ordering used movies.",1366070400,,335,4.203125
4302710,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"It is a johnny dep movie and a pirate movie but other than that, the plot was forced to crank out another movie. like many sequels, they ripped of the wrong parts. The other sequels in this series were great but this one lacked any sort of character development and was just a treasure hunt.",1365724800,,291,4.3090909090909095
4302711,4,B004A8ZWUQ,The delivery was fast and the movie is great! Although it was not as long as all the other pirates of the Caribbeans but it is still good,1365638400,,137,3.9285714285714284
4302712,2,B004A8ZWUQ,Did not hold up to the last 3.... I would recommend watching one of the first two again instead of this one.,1365638400,,108,3.9545454545454546
4302713,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Pirates of the Caribbean fufills the sequel for the series, and truly does it justice. I recommend that if you are a true Pirates fan please watch this movie or buy it or rent it or something!",1365552000,,192,4.216216216216216
4302714,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Johnny Depp is at his best here, sharing the spotlight with the ever sexy Salma Hayek.  On Stranger Tides has the best ending of them all.",1365120000,,138,4.3076923076923075
4302715,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"I'm making my collection of these movies. I didn't find the collectors edition (maybe it's not out yet) but the dvd arrived quickly and in perfect conditions. The image and sound quality is perfect, can't complain. Very pleased.",1365120000,,228,5.026315789473684
4302716,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"The first was still the best. Later movies always gave me the feeling they were trying to cram as much stuff as they could into it, like government contractors who get a percentage of the volume, too much clutter. I miss the perfection of story, dialogue, performance, environment and really, every aspect.... of the first movie.
This movie, like the last two, has great moments but too much clutter and too many aspects of, ""what has that to do with anything?""
Like a string of exciting vignettes, great special effects, lightly pasted together by having the same actors....

Perhaps, not being a gamer I miss that it really is the story line for a future of games...
Still, worth seeing and owning.",1364860800,,700,4.737704918032787

4302743,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"I am a big fan of the first three films and they are very good entertainment. But when Gore Verbinski left the director's chair Disney should have left it alone after that. This installment lacks the fun, style and wit of the first three. Very little humor and Johnny Depp looked bored throughout this poorly plotted film. It leaves me dumbstruck reading these 5 star reviews saying this is the best entry of the series let alone saying this is as good as the first movie. I don't see how Depp can see any value in this film unless he is locked into a contract with Disney for so many films and he just wants to get it over with. In my humble opinion this is the worst of the series and i would hope that looking for a seasoned director will do the next movie better, I hope.",1364342400,11,775,4.208053691275167
4302744,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"I had to get the last one in my collection! Now I have all 4! My adult son never saw the last one, so we watched it on movie night. Great one, but not as good as the last one.",1363996800,,175,3.4
4302745,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"Michael Jordan made a brilliant decision when he choose to retire while he was on top of his game. Unfortunately, Disney did not follow that same thought when it came to the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The first three films present one complete story. This film requires an entirely new story, totally independent from the previous films. Imagine hanging out with stranger who looks exactly like your best friend, but they have not shared in any part of your life journey. Sadly, that is how Captain Jack Sparrow comes across in this film.",1363910400,,544,4.797872340425532

4302747,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"My family loves this show. I really enjoyed all three of the first Pirates films, but the original was much better than the second two. This is a return to the fun of the original. It isn't weighed down with all the Will and Elizabeth love story and the endless double and triple crosses. It is just good fun!",1363910400,,309,4.254237288135593

4302763,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Received in great condition. was very entertaining to watch over and over, I really enjoy watching this kind of video.",1363305600,,118,4.95
4302764,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"After the last three, it would have been hard to top ""At World's End"", which is why I find this one surprising. While it lacks the frenetic energy of the last three films, it stayed true to the fact that it was the next quest on the list for the infamous Jack Sparrow. Jack discovers an equal in a woman from his past while another infamous pirate, Blackbeard, seeks the Fountain of Youth as well. All must seek it ahead of the Spanish, who are bent on destroying it. Jack doen't know if he fears Blackbeard or the woman he knows who holds a terrible curse over him as they seek an enchanted cup and a mermaid's tear that will allow only one to drink from the fabled fountain. While this film is good and an excellent way to spend an evening. It makes for a great wrap up to this series. It's like the aftermath to a storm. exciting, but glad for the end of it.",1363219200,,861,4.161676646706587

4302767,5,B004A8ZWUQ,Have not seen a Pirates of the Caribbean movie that I havent' loved. They are great entertainment. Fun to watch,1362700800,,111,4.6
4302778,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"This is the 4th installment of the POTC franchise.  For a movie (series) based on a theme park ride, this satisfies more than it should.  POTC4 faced incredible odds as it shed many favorite characters from teh original trilogy.  But it transcends this and stands as a very fun movie in its own right.  You still need the backstory from the previous movies, or at least some of it, to fully appreciate the plot.  However, this movie starts its own path well and apparently will see yet another sequel in the future.

3D often seems best for animation or computer generated graphics, and not so much for live action.  This movie is an exception and does the 3D format justice, even when large computer generated special effects aren't being used.",1362528000,,745,4.684615384615385
4302779,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Not my favorite of all the Pirates movies, except that it features mermaids!  Got this for someone as a gift and they love it.",1362528000,,126,4.25
4302780,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"I have purchased all of Johnny Depps movies. Not only is he a great actor, but he seems to fit his part in each movie so easily. The quality of this DVD is good, have no complaints about this purchase.",1362528000,,201,4.05
4302781,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I have seen all three previous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, which were outright enchanting and entertaining. When watching ""On Stranger Tides,"" I felt a bit of disappointment of the fact that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were no longer presented in the film, but I came to the realization that their characters had had completed their stories, so to speak.

Admittedly, ""On Stranger Tides"" by itself is an entertaining film to watch. It's an interesting story of the adventure to find the Fountain of Youth and the encounter with the infamous pirate Blackbeard (played by Ian McShane). It was really a good movie to watch. What really gave me nightmares were the mermaids. I actually thought all mermaids were ""good"" and ""lovely"" but not man-eating creatures. Now I learnt a very important lesson from this film: stay away from mermaids.

All in all, it's an enjoyable film.",1362355200,,884,4.966216216216216

4302884,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Critics gave mixed to negative reviews for this movie.  They said that it is un original and boring.  Screw them!  Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the best film of 2011.  I'll tell you why.

I am a huge Pirates of the Caribbean fan.  I own all the movies on both DVD and Blu-ray.  I have digital copies of all of them on my Blackberry Playbook, I own most of their toys including vintage Curse of The Black Pearl.  I love Pirates!

When I first heard that this movie was coming out, I was jumping for joy!  I saw it a few weeks after it came out in 2D.  I was going to go to the 3D premiere but I got sick.  I loved it!

This movie has the action, adventure and humour: just like the original!  This is what At World's End lacked in.  At World's End is a good Pirates film if you want drama and less comedy.

This film has everything in it.  You will never want it to end!

4302913,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Pirates is a long movie. Too long. And, yet, not long enough. The writers wrote this long, rambling script with lots of extra stuff in it. Stuff that, really, has nothing to do with the actual plot. I'm assuming it has an actual plot, although I'm not convinced the writers had agreed on one specific one. At some point, they realized it was too long. Cuts needed to be made. Instead of carving out the non-essential elements, they just chopped off the first third of the movie, leaving something that was still too long but without any kind of foundation. At least, that's what it felt like.

For instance, the movie opens with Mr. Gibbs on trial. He's being tried as Jack Sparrow. How did he come to be on trial and why do they think he's Jack? We don't know. And we don't get to know. Of course, Jack is there to rescue him. Gibbs is surprised to see Jack, because Jack had nothing to do with why he's on trial, Jack just happened to hear about it and decided to rescue his old friend. Because, you know, Jack is prone to thinking about other people before himself. During all of the action revolving around the rescue, we find out we're already in the midst of the story, ""I hear you've been looking for the Fountain of Youth."" ""Why, yes. Yes, I am."" Something close to that, at any rate. And there we are in the middle of the story without any of the reasons for it. Of course, in the end, the ""story"" isn't even the story, because, well, as I said, the writers didn't know which story they were telling. The rescue of Gibbs and Jack's escape is the best part of the movie, though, and that, actually, has nothing to do with any story. It's just a bit of fun. Think car chase with no cars.

There's also a completely non-essential sub-plot, or, maybe, it is the plot, between a missionary and a mermaid. I think they were probably trying to recapture the romance between Swan and Turner from the previous movies, but, in truth, they are who the previous movies are about, so it worked. This movie, Jack is the main character, and we have no reason to care about the missionary and the mermaid, so we don't.

I could go on about the plot issues. For instance, there's the inclusion of the Spanish, who are there as no more than a deus ex machina device except not. There's Blackbeard. Why? I don't really know. Theoretically, he's important to the plot, but, unfortunately, he's also unnecessary. Anyway...

The other central issue to the movie is that the actors, over all, don't give the parts any life. It felt like watching a dress rehearsal. Hmm... no, not a dress rehearsal, a last run through of the dialogue while in costume. Oh, there are moments, but not enough of them. Johnny Depp even falls flat for much of the movie, but it may just be that the script kept trying to force him out of character. Like rescuing Gibbs when he was getting nothing out of it. Geoffrey Rush almost pulls off Barbossa, but he, also, is frequently out of character because of the script. It's like the writers had a basket of characters that they plugged in whether they should have been there or not. Well, actually, they had characters they needed to put into the movie and stuck them into the best places possible even if they didn't quite fit.

The biggest disappointment was Ian McShane. If I had never seen Deadwood, I probably wouldn't have given him a second thought; however, I have seen Deadwood, so I know what he's capable of. His rendition of Blackbeard was not it. Flat as a cardboard cut out. If they hadn't told us in the movie that Blackbeard was supposed to be scary and evil, I never would have known. And don't get me started on the cheesy scenes of him and his sword that they put in just for the 3d effects even though they didn't do anything for the actual story (no, I didn't see it in 3d, so they were doubly wasted on me).

The biggest surprise was Penelope Cruz. That may be because I was expecting absolutely nothing more than a piece of eye candy from her, but she was actually decent. As decent as the script allowed, at any rate.

Oh, and they stuck Keith Richards in just so he could be in the movie. Sort of like the random old guy that wanders through and says ""Beware...!"" the whatever and then is gone. Yeah, that was his bit.

What it comes down to is that I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. At least, not for seeing it in the theater. It's probably worth a rental, but it has nothing to make it worth seeing at the theater. Not unless you just want to pay the 3d price in order to see a few swords and ropes flying out of the screen at you.",1357344000,14,4580,4.3610785463071515

The others that made the cast to well rounded decided to move on. It's still a pretty good movie, but not nearly as exciting. The boxset is not bad, but Disney's failure to include Digital Copies with this Blu-Ray\DVD versions is so strange especially since everyone else does for the same price.",1356652800,,465,4.5476190476190474

4302968,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"12.26.2012

Not sure why anyone would buy this movie unless they've seen it and liked it, or if someone asked for it as a gift, I suppose.....

But buying it used on Amazon.com is the way to go.  We paid less than $14 for it to be shipped to our house and it would have cost us more than that to go to the movies for two adults!

And seriously, it's a good one - worthy of paying the extra for the difference between DVD and Blue Ray, though this comes with DVD just in case.  But if you have a big screen, surround system and a good blue ray player, grow some patience and wait for these types of movies to come out on blue ray.  It's really not all that different from the big screen experience.",1356480000,,697,4.0144927536231885

4302972,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"The final outing for the POTC franchise was released to great fanfare but disappointed at the theaters.  Being the least successful at the box office, and with critics, this film probably marked the end of the POTC franchise as only three actors returned to the cast from all the prior films.  But Disney compensated by releasing the film in the most elaborate Blu-ray package of all the POTC films.  Coming in both 2-D and 3-D, along with a digital version, the package is topped of with an exclusive set from Lego that is a representation of the Black Pearl.

The film itself is good, but not great as it lacks much of the spontaneity and craziness of the prior three films.  Also missing is the great soundtracks found in the prior films.  The story is still original, and the acting is spot on.  The DVD does come with extra scenes not found in the theatrical release; however it is not incorporated into the final film.  Overall, a must buy for POTC fans, but everyone else can get away with buying the stand-alone DVD or Blu-Ray.",1356307200,,1035,4.556756756756757

4303024,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"OK, first off let me say I love Johnny Depp on any movie and this was no exception. If the review was just for his acting, I'd give it a four star but it's not and the rest of the cast just blew it. Four things majorly wrong with this movie compared to the other three:

1. No powerful water scenes. Come on, a movie based on water has Johnny running through the streets of England is just pathetic to me. There were no thrilling boat scenes at all other than to get somewhere in land.  I'm not spoiling it, I'm just saying, lame.
2. No scary pirates. Black Beard was very interesting until he showed up, then it went straight down hill from there. Compared to Barbossa who was undead and Davy Jones with his tentacle thingies which were scary, this guy is a bummer.
3. No Will, No Elizabeth. Come on, need I say more?
4. Penelope Cruz. And last but not least, this woman.  Please don't think I'm not a fan, ok yes I'm not a fan, but please stop putting her in movies! Lose the accent and get acting classes and maybe just maybe she'll be ok. She's a beautiful woman I know, but she just flat out ruined this movie. Trust me, she is NO Keira Knightley or any other good actress out there.

Woo, I think I just let out all my frustrations out on this movie. But really, I was so disappointing in this part that I probably have more than four reasons why I don't like it but I wanted to tone it down a bit. I LOVED part one, two, three and I am hoping there's a next part otherwise what a sad way to end this amazing series.",1355097600,,1522,4.097315436241611

This is a little different from the other 3 films. The cast has changed. Depp and Rush are still the major characters.

4303124,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"The fourth entry in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series is a solid addition, and the most enjoyable I've seen since the original. It doesn't manage to recapture the magic of the first film, ""Curse of the Black Pearl"", but it does do a better job than numbers two and three, in terms of creating an enjoyable adventure flick. Unfortunately, it suffers from some of the bloat that the previous two entries were guilty of (though not as badly), and there are far too many ""epic sword battles"" that eventually blur into one another, during which I found myself zoning out (the outcome is always the same, as near as I've been able to tell).

On the plus side, we get to witness a brilliant performance by Ian McShane as the legendary pirate Black Beard. McShane is one of the best actors I've ever seen, and his role as a scoundrel brought back fond memories of his time as ""Al Swearengen"" on ""Deadwood"". Johnny Depp also does a great job as Jack Sparrow. His zaniness was somewhat turned down for this one, I felt, and this slightly subdued approach worked much better than trying to constantly get crazier and crazier.

4303147,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Pirates of the Caribbean:On Stranger Tides(released May/11)is a welcome comeback for the franchise,which had bogged down in the second film,and started a slow climb up in the third;but not reaching quite up to the scale of the first film or this one. This one finds Depp firmly back in Sparrows character with all the ""isms"" he can muster,with a nicely edited and fast moving piece. .
The plot finds Sparrow in London and his first mate Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin McNally)has been mistakenly dragged into court to face charges as...Jack Sparrow. The presiding judge is none other than the real Sparrow and he sentences his first mate to life in prison. In a typical switcharoo Sparrow accompanies his first mate as they are taken to prison,but when they arrive it seems they are both sentenced to die. Sparrow is brought before King George II(Richard Griffiths),who wants him to accompany his old nemesis Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush),to find the fabled fountain of youth(remember that compass from the last film?).Sparrow will have none of it and slips away from the crowded room. During his escapes he briefly runs into his father who gives him warnings re the fountain of youth and about an imposter of him that is trying to put a crew together. Sparrow ends up at a tavern and he meets his imposter,one Angelica(Penlope Cruz),who he deflowered in a convent years before and had not seen since. She claims she is the daughter of the infamous pirate Blackbeard,and before you can say Black Pearl,he is waylayed and brought on board Blackbeards ship. Back at the prison Barbarossa forces Sparrows first mate into servitude aboard his ship,as Gibbs also knows the location of the magical waters.
No one has seen Blackbeard,so Sparrow instigates a mutiny on his ship. He almost succeeds until Blackbeard appears before the crew and stops the mutiny in its tracks. With things settled into a manor more sided towards Blackbeard's purposes,the ship sails to find a mermaid from which its tears may be extracted,and Ponce de Leon's ship and the two chalices on board. Barbarossa is sailing also for the fountain but with a different purpose. It was Blackbeard that took the Black Pearl away from him and forced Barbarossa to cut his own leg off to save his life;so revenge,not youth,is on his mind. Add to all this the Spanish,who are also intent on finding the fountain,but again cross purposes to Blackbeard and Barbarossa;to destroy the fountain which is blasphemous to them and their Catholic beliefs.
Blackbeard captures a mermaid for her tears after a drawn and bloody battle. When they reach the land of the fountain,a decided impasse in the form of a cavernous ravine appears before them,at the bottom of which is a fast flowing river. Blackbeard forces Sparrow to jump into the water to search for Ponce De Leon's ship and the chalices. Jack finds the ship and Barbarossa;who has beat him to it. The ship sits on the edge of a cliff and they must both do a balancing act to get the cups. But they find the Spanish have beaten them to the punch.
Sparrow and Barbarossa raid the Spanish encampment and steal the cups. Jack and Barbarossa agree to work together to defeat Blackbeard. Sparrow returns with cups and takes Blackbeard to the fountain. Before long Barbarossa enters the picture,then the Spanish. A drawn and drag em out fight ensues with the Spanish trashing the fountain,Barabrossa getting his revenge on Blackbeard and Jack using the fountain to save Angelca's life.
Sparrow however strands Angelica on a desert island,Barbarossa returns to pirating on Blackbeards ship and Jack and his first mate start looking for a way to get the Black Pearl,in glass jar from Blackbeards ship,out of its prison. The film fades out as a voodoo doll of Jack,which Blackbeard had made,floats into the possession of a smiling Angelica.
Fast paced,well acted and scripted,the film is filled with Sparrow-isms and good doses of comedy. It is what made the first film so successful and I'm glad they have returned to this way of doing Pirates,once more.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. The only extras are commentary and deleted scenes.
A highly recommended fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Its pace and sense of humour harkens back to the first one,taking most of its good,and dispensing with most of the bad. 4-4 1/2 stars.",1348444800,,4397,4.9033557046979865

If you are a fan of the Pirates series of movies, let's just say, this one doesn't disappoint at all.

Johnny Depp is again at the helm as Captain Jack Sparrow. No one could EVER do this part better than Johnny Depp. Believe me when I say, after 4 movies, he doesn't miss a step as Captain Jack and it's all just as fresh as movie one.

The addition of Blackbeard and his daughter are very well written and casted. I didn't even miss Keira Knightly as Elizabeth and Orlando Bloom as Will Turner... in fact, I found it rather refreshing that they were NOT in this movie at all.

Things that refer to God or spiritual things you don't expect to find in a pirate movie and seeing them in this one was very pleasant. I would recommend.,1341619200,,477,4.448275862068965

I may be a little biased as I'm a Johnny Depp fan, but this latest incarnation in the franchise still seems fresh [it happens all too often with other hit movies - the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sequels most always come off as stale retreads of the original].

What I really didn't understand was the love between the preacher pirate and the mermaid.  It didn't tie into the plot at all.  At least Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann got to know each other through the first 3 and you got an idea of the grounds for their love. Penelope Cruz was an interesting pick for the female lead.  She has worked with Johnny Depp before and both are very talented, but in this movie, talent seemed not to be there.  Penelope seemed like a cardboard character and Johnny Depp seemed like he was bored with the whole thing.  It's no wonder they're re writing the script for the next one.  The whole movie seemed to be rushed, the plot was all over the place and not solid and the script was not well written.  They need to work a lot harder for the next Pirates of the Caribbean, or they're going to lose the audience.  It was not the Johnny Depp you know.",1341532800,2,971,4.291208791208791

4303205,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Brian Nallick wrote, ""The first half of the movie is VERY heavy on action with little bits of dialog in between the chaos.""  This is the part I don't understand.  I must have purchased a different movie that had been mislabeled with the same title.  The version that I bought was completely different.

True there was action enough to sate the action lovers among us but my version was heavy on dialog in the first half.  The dialog, in fact, was so prevalent and convoluted that I said to myself several times that I was going to have to watch this movie several times to understand exactly what was going on.  Maybe that says something about my level of intelligence - I hope not.

I read Mr. Nallick's review before I purchased the movie and was expecting 75 to 90 percent action.  I was dreading watching the movie because my favorite of the three original POTC movies was the third. (At World's End)  I know, this is not a very popular opinion because most critics seem to dislike the amount of dialog.

But how about the fourth movie (On Stranger Tides) for which this review is being written?  Was it good enough for a lover of the series (as I am) to enjoy it?  Did it fall flat on it's face like most sequels seem to do?  Was it worth the price of admission?

I loved it!  Hands down, no hesitation, no argument.  I'll admit that I was, at first, a little disappointed that some of the characters from the other three movies were not present but like some of the other reviewers I forgot them completely soon after the first few minutes.  No, I'm not talking about Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley but some of the more colorful characters like Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook as Pintel and Ragetti.  As far as I am concerned these two stole the show every time they appeared on screen.  Also. I absolutely loved Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and Martin Klebba as Marty was great for making me laugh many times.

As far as the dialog/action ratio, I feel that this movie was done right.  I was never bored and always had my intellect stroked.  I got caught up in the story and was glued to the screen throughout the movie.

I always judge a movie by the way it makes me feel when it is over.  When the credits started I immediately checked my feeling and emotions and gave this movie a thumbs up.  I wanted it to continue.  I had not had enough.  If you are reading this review in order to make a decision about purchasing this movie let me admonish you to buy it.  You will not be disappointed.

Unlike the first three movies, there was almost no action, very little humor, a lack of several of the characters we had come to know and love in the previous films, and then the ones in this film had little to no motivation to be doing what they were doing.  And then at the end, you are left with several unanswered questions and loose ends and no hope of a sequel.  Even if there is a sequel, I won't waste my time.",1340323200,3,612,4.066666666666666
4303210,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"After enjoying ""John Carter"", I was equally surprised to discover that ""PotC4"" was not the oven-ready gobbler so many critics made it out to be. One of the ""shill"" critics said it was the best of the series -- and there's a big grain of truth in that.

""PotC2"" and ""PotC3"" -- regardless of their merits as stories -- were plot-heavy. That there were three groups with differing, conflicting goals -- which were never particularly clear -- didn't help one's enjoyment.

""PotC4"" has a clearer and less-baroque storyline. There are still three groups, but we know what two of them are doing, and why. (The Spaniards' motive isn't revealed until the end, and it's a real -- and highly logical -- surprise.)

Johnny Depp is back to playing the (relatively) more-sober and less-overtly flamboyant Captain Jack of the first film, a major plus. (Don't forget that he got an Oscar nomination for that performance. A best-actor nomination for fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or action roles is almost unheard-of. *)

The first two-thirds are extremely funny, but the story turns uncharacteristically (for this series) dark towards the end, becoming a kind of ""Splash Meets Jaws"". Also uncharacteristically, the story (semi-)seriously examines issues of morality and redemption. The ending is startlingly misogynistic -- which is not surprising behavior for pirates.

If I have any generic complaint about the series as a whole, it's that there are no //really good// sword fights. This is probably for practical reasons -- none of the stories builds to a sword-fighting climax (as ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""Rob Roy"" do), so there's no point in training the actors. The days of Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone are long gone.

The PG-13 rating is justified -- this is not a film for the youngsters. (I seriously question the ethics of LEGO's marketing products based specifically on this film.)

I really enjoyed ""On Stranger Tides"", when I didn't expect to. I can't guarantee anything, but if you liked the first one, you'll probably like the last.

4303212,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Currently a captain without a ship - the Black Pearl having been shrunk and placed inside a sealed bottle, at least for the time being - the inimitable Jack Sparrow finds himself impressed on a vessel, captained by the Spanish pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), that is hot on the trail of Ponce de Leon's famed but ever elusive Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, a British contingent, led by peg-legged ""privateer, not pirate"" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), is on the same mission, though he claims to be doing it not for personal enrichment but for king and country.

""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,"" with a screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rosio and direction by Rob Marshall, keeps the storyline fairly simple and streamlined this time out, avoiding the overstuffed, convoluted plotting that often made the earlier installments all but impossible to follow. Even Johnny Depp himself, in the spirit of the enterprise, seems to have toned down some of the more flamboyant qualities of his earlier performances and appears to be relishing playing a pirate who is less in charge of his own fate and more at the mercy of the other characters this time around. Yet, he's still able to land a sharp-tongued barb with the best of them, whether it be against Blackbeard, Barbossa or Angelica, the feisty love interest played by the beautiful Penelope Cruz.

As is par for the course, the movie runs on far too long, padding out its length with a sappy romance between a preacher-man and a mermaid and a few too many distended swordfights for the movie's (and the audience's) good, but, overall, this turns out to be one of the less top-heavy and heavy-handed of the ""Pirates"" films.",1338940800,,1682,4.857142857142857
4303213,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"This one integrates the real pirate 'blackbeard' into the storyline. The real blackbeard was a very fearsome and bloody pirate who got his head cut off in battle with the british navy off the coast of america. He was a american pirate for sure , although americans were really mainly british at this time. But this version is a good one , he's a truly nasty piece of work and that's a good thing. THe plot is easier to understand than the third one too. The action is very good the story is acceptable. There hasn't been a bad pirates of the carribean movie yet though. People expect too much from sequels usually. THe first is always going to be the freshest. The 3d version is the one to get as that is how it was shown at the theaters. And it is a good showcase of 3d. I must say I am tired of getting dvd's and digital copies in my package though because it drives up the price. I don't NEED a dvd copy.. They are wasting money doing that. The blu ray looks stunning and the extras are nice. Obviously if you don't have a 3d tv then only need the standard blu ray. Either version looks stunning on disc and is worth owning if you like the series. This is a fun movie and the acting is as good as the other versions with penelope cruz doing a fine job as the lead actress. Get it if you like the series, it's got plenty of action and humour in it.",1338508800,,1350,4.117424242424242

It is missing some memorable characters as well. Some folk's like this movie and rate it high, but we each have different thoughts and reasons behind our ratings. It was of course well done as movies go, but as for myself (an award winning author), I could have given them a much better story line sequal. I would not have bought it if I had seen it previously, but it does serve to complete the collection. Regretably, MST",1338422400,,576,4.495238095238095
4303215,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny exciting and full of action. The story line being totally different than the previous three was a problem for some people with the cast changes. If you watch the movie without expecting things to be like the others and just watch it as a totally different film, it is top notch. It was just as good as the others and in some ways better. I love the series from the beginning and  would buy another when it comes out with the new story and characters. It was so well put together and the story kept us both, my husband and I, not wanting to miss an instant of the film. Can't wait for the next one to be released and see where the saga takes us this time. Going into this film without a preconcieved idea of what it should be like is the best way to approach this film and if you can do this I think you will thoroughly enjoy every minute of Captain Jack Sparrows undertakings again. We chose to watch this as if the only characters we knew were Captain Jack and Captain Barbosa and it really worked. We both loved this film as much as the others.

Pirates is the best movie series that I have seen in a long time and I watch a lot of films. I will continue to buy Johnny Depp's Captain Jack for as long as he wants to play the character and know that I won't be let down any time I turn one on.

Pirates of the Caribbean IV: On Stranger Tides

I actually had some better hopes for this one than the others when I saw the trailers. Why, I don't know, maybe because I was simply glad they had FINALLY managed to ditch Elizabeth! But no, in getting rid of her, they had to recruit ANOTHER really annoying and pointless female character...but I'll get to that later.

At first glance, this plot line at least seems more normal than the last two. They're trying to find the Fountain of Youth and that's a good adventure plot line, very cliche, and not so bad for a swashbuckler. But do not be deceived. This one ended up being even more weird than the others, if that can be possible.

The opening in this movie where Jack Sparrow is with the king and all, was so very typical of him. Just random stuff he does. The only thing this scene did for me was make me REALLY want a cream puff...badly. I LOVE cream puffs and they don't sell the blasted things in theater concession stands so in the long run, it just made me angry. I liked the carriage chase through London, that was cool, but it would have been cooler if it had been a Dick Turpin highwayman movie or something. Zorro pulled this kind of scene off better anyway.

And so the crew gets back together and get their plan together to go and find the fountain of youth. However... and here is a huge rant coming...

This movie, above all the others, made me want to hit my head against the wall because of the fact that they HAD to use Black Beard as their main villain. They could have easily taken the character they created and given him a different name and no one would have cared. Whoever this character was, he was certainly not Black Beard as in Edward Teach. They did ZERO research for this movie. I mean, seriously, if you're going to use an historical character, then at least TRY to do a little bit of research. All they even needed to do was listen to the Horrible Histories song about Black Beard. The only thing they got right was his ship's name, Queen Anne's Revenge.(And here's a point I would like to make. Black Beard was around during the reign of Queen Anne. But guess who was the king during this movie? George II!) But they gave him a 'magic sword' and a-- wait for it--zombie crew!!! The worst part about the zombie crew was the fact that they weren't even a huge plot. They never did anything! Why bother with zombies when they have no point? They never did anything zombie-ish, they didn't even try to turn anyone into zombies. And his tiny ship in a bottle collection was just weird. I can see Poseidon having a collection like this, but Black Beard?

And that's not even the worst part. He has a daughter. Yep, a daughter. Like one of those teenage girl books that are always the same (""Black Beard's Daughter"") Would you read it if it was a book? Then why would we want to watch it? And even worse (yes it even gets worse) she had some far-off fling with Jack Sparrow apparently. Seriously he's too old for her and by the fourth movie, I think we can all assume that Jack Sparrow is not physically or mentally capable of actually being in a relationship with anyone. And she's almost worse than Elizabeth because she has more angst. I think I groaned audibly when I saw her come onto scene for the first time. She was actually dressed as Jack Sparrow...

Okay, I'll take this chance to introduce another character in this movie: Philip whats-his name. Congratulations, Philip, you won the award for being the most pointless character in the history of story telling! *applause* Seriously, this guy had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. The only thing he even managed to do was get the blasted mermaid--who he had a brief love affair with--to cry (I'll get to the mermaids later) and then he dies right afterward for no reason at all! I do know why they cast him though, and that was for the ladies, because, let's face it, he was the only remotely handsome guy in this movie since we got rid of Will and Norrington. Yes, I'm onto them...

Okay, so the mermaids... Frankly I don't know much about traditional mermaids, but if you think of them kind of like silkies, I guess this could go over. I did not approve of the scene where they push the poor men out as bait for the mermaids. Very mean, that! They don't want to be pieces of meat for evil female beasties! And this scene could have been half as long as it was. We got the picture after the third guy was drowned, and then they finally caught a mermaid who was awkwardly half naked through the whole movie. Philip was a gentleman though and gave her his shirt. This was another thing he was good for; a walking armoire.

Oh yes, and the only part I liked about this movie was Barbosa. Seriously, this guy should have been the star because he was just as great in this movie as he was in the rest. I did enjoy all the parts he was in, especially since he didn't care for Jack Sparrow any more than I did. Watching them work together was funny because we all know Barbosa is the better pirate. And of course it was Jack who got them captured by the Spanish who were also looking for the Fountain. The escape scene with the palm trees? I'm not even going to go there. But I think it almost surpassed the water wheel. Actually, yes it did.

So back to the reason why this movie was even weirder than the others. The way they get to the Fountain of Youth, was just plain odd. Why on earth is the whole place upside-down? I didn't get this at all, and the whole kind of weird whatever that was going on was just...weird. I can't describe it. So you can guess that a battle ensues. Barbosa was awesome; his fight with Black Beard was the best part of this movie, and amazingly the only fight scene in the whole series that looked like a real fight scene, but then the ones with Barbosa usually did. So Black Beard is killed, obviously, because he's bad. Barbosa gets the Black Pearl back (it's his ship, not Jack's!) from the bottles where Black Beard had been keeping them, and in the end he maroons Jack and Black Beard's daughter on an island. That was the worst part of the whole movie. Why? Because it foretold tales of doom that there would be YET ANOTHER SEQUEL! AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!",1337385600,,6391,4.362184873949579

4303277,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Jack Sparrow is back to his old ways in this movie, and I wouldn't have it any other way. I never really noticed that the guy and chick from the original trilogy were missing, but as long as Jack is in the movies, it can be called a Pirated of the Caribbean.
The story is pretty cool, and it could open up a new trilogy for PotC. It follows two legends this time around, Black beard and the Fountain of Youth. I really loved what they did with Black Beard with all the twists and turns along the way.

The music is a bit different, some of the original theme can be heard in some of the scenes, but I am a bit disappointed they didn't have more of it in the movie, since it holds value to the series. The new music they did add wasn't too bad, but most of it was forgettable and I was waiting for more of the main theme to play instead of those.

Acting is really good in this movie, and Johnny Depp is still a great Jack Sparrow. The accents the other actors were believable and I couldn't tell if that was them acting or their natural voice. Blackbeard comes off as really powerful and evil and the actor that played him made that role come to life.

Overall I say this isn't a bad movie, but you should watch the originally trilogy first so you are caught up on what's happened so far. If you have watched the originally trilogy and loved Jack Sparrows adventures and mannerisms, than this is the movie for you.

* Jack Sparrow is still awesome
* Setting and story are great

4303280,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"I avoided this film until this past week when I watched it on my TV after reading some of the positive reviews posted on Amazon. I liked the first film in the series. No so much the following sequels. Hopefully this terrible 4th film will kill the franchise off for good. It is an example of bad filmmaking and indicative of why the Disney Corp has had so much difficulty making good movies these days.
'On Stranger Tides' might have been a pleasant diversion if it were the length of a typical TV show (42 minutes), but at 132 minutes, it was painfully overlong, overly complicated, and a bore.
The cast does as well as can be expected. Depp has some amusing bits but he looks tired in most of the film. Perhaps he was counting his fee and telling himself that the cash was worth the indignation of repeating the role of Capt Jack Sparrow once again. The storyline is uninteresting and convoluted and seems to have been assembled in typical Disney fashion by putting together pieces of story here and there that must have sounding good across the conference table but only look good in 30 second advertisements.
The best sequence by far is the very first 15 minutes which captures some of the joy of the first Pirate's film. Unfortunately, it is downhill from then on. Most of the action sequences are poorly edited and difficult to follow.
A final note on the DVD transfer. Whether due to the original filming or improper video transfer, the DVD version is much to dark too watch on a flatscreen.",1333152000,7,1498,4.551851851851852

4303282,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

Thus far in my travels with the Pirates Of The Caribbean, I've experienced The Curse Of The Black Pearl, opened the Dead Man's Chest, and sailed the weird and haunted shores At World's End. So, when the opportunity arose for me to set sail once again On Stranger Tides, how could I resist? Personally, I enjoy all three previous entries in the series, with my only complaint being that there are no deleted scenes on the DVD of Dead Man's Chest (some scenes were filmed, but ultimately cut; I think it's always nice to include deleted scenes from a movie and know why they were excised, as some think the scenes were absolutely neccessary whlle others might might not, but enjoy seeing them nonetheless), and only two deleted scenes were included on the DVD of At World's End (I know that twenty minutes worth of footage was cut from the film, including a scene where Admiral Norrington tries to persuade Governor Swann from killing Davy Jones, and for some reason, those twenty minutes were not included on the DVD as deleted or extended scenes). But I digress.

This latest voyage with the Pirates Of The Caribbean is another gold mine for Walt Disney Pictures. The twists keep on coming, there's still action & romance a-plenty, and of course, a dash of rougish charm. Captain Jack is back, and this time, he's joined by yet another lovely young lady who is easy on the eyes (as well as a good actress), and Barbossa has apparently switched sides. As with the previous films, the plot is very engaging, and you're never bored for a moment. The score is excellent, remeniscent of the first three movies while incorporating new themes as well.

Biblically speaking, there is barely any offensive content, as is usual with Disney films, and consistent with the previous three movies. There is violence, but as expected, it is never graphic and mostly bloodless. There's one moderate imprecation used (during the film's climax), but it's appropriate, given the situation. And of course, there is the innuendo, but given that it's a pirate film, but a Disney movie at heart, it's always light and humorous. I admit, I had my reservations about the mermaids when I saw the trailer (I thought, ""Do they HAVE to be topless? This is a DISNEY movie."") As it turns out, my reservations were unnecessary, as the screenwriters and director were discreet in filming the scenes with the mermaids. Nothing is shown. There is a Christian missionary in the film, and he is portrayed in a positive light, unusual for a non-Christian movie, but of course very commendable. Though he IS on the receiving end of some light-hearted quips, his calling is never disrespected, and as per the previous movies, God's name is never taken in vain. (It's a Disney film, and with the disappointing exception of the recently released John Carter, which I have not seen, Disney has respected the Name of God, at least when it comes to their movies; in television, that's another story). SPOILER ALERT!!! As in the previous entries, Jack sacrifices his own selfish desire to do what he knows in his heart is the right thing to do. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! I highly recommend that you accept this latest invitation to sail with the Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.

I think the film could have been rated PG.",1332201600,,3332,4.759515570934256

There was no ""there"" there in the actress who played the captured mermaid, no there there with the wishy-washy  actor who replaced Orlando. Zimmer's magnificent score from POTC-1 just degraded all the way down to this sequel. He seems tired too.

The 4th movie however is just a mess of running around, rampage, things falling, out of place ""humor"", etc etc etc. There were a ton of characters and ""sides"" that participated in this so called ""adventure"" yet essentially resulted in nothing. The main villain, the Black Beard was far less fearsome and impressive than main villains from the previous movies.

I had been a Depp fan since childhood and had enjoyed his status as an idiosyncratic outsider, content to play dress up with his friends, and when I first saw a preview for Pirates of the Caribbean, I must admit that my eyes rolled and asked myself, what the hell is Depp thinking?  And then the movie came out.  Not only was the film filled with clever conceits, thanks in part to a screenplay that felt like the intricate work of an old fashioned clockmaker, but Depp turned in a surprisingly rousing performance as the effete, possibly insane pirate, Jack Sparrow.  Here was a multi-million dollar film and in the center stood a character fueled by pure id, stabbing other characters in the back in a moments notice while never letting the audience in on whether he does so out of a sense of self preservation or as part of a grander, more heroic scheme.  If there is a Falstaff for the 21st century, then his name is Jack Sparrow.

And then the sequels happened.  Weighted down by their ever expanding mythology, Dead Man's Chest and At World's End limped through their expanding running time while dragging along enough subplots for at least five more films.  At the beginning of the first film we are concerned with Depp's attempts to reclaim his ship and the romance between Will and Elizabeth, but by the end of the third movie a major plot point pivoted around the unrequited love of Calypso, a tertiary character who would have been mostly forgettable if she weren't played by the immensely talented Naomie Harris.  Where The Curse of the Black Pearl's tight plotting and clearly established supernatural rules made it seem shorter than its two hours and fifteen minutes, the two sequels felt much, much longer than their already bloated running times.  I understand that the filmmakers were trying to give us a bang for our buck, but they also needed to learn how to leave the audience wanting more.

It is with these widely held critiques in mind that the filmmakers went into the fourth Pirates movie, On Stranger Tides.  And there are several elements that tell us that the movie is attempting to swing all the way back around to the original film in hopes of bottling a little of the magic that made the first film a runaway success.  First, Will and Elizabeth have been jettisoned from the film.  This is good news because these two characters seemed unnecessary in the last two movies, and it increasingly felt as if the actors had merely wandered onto the set because they had nowhere else to go.  Second, the film is only tenuously connected to the byzantine mythology of the last few films.  Sure, characters like Captain Barbossa show up, but it is not necessary to be intimately familiar with the details of his curse, death and resurrection from the other three films.  Both of these choices allow the film to focus on what really matters: the character of Jack Sparrow.

So, does the film actually accomplish what it set out to do?  Is On Stranger Tides a return to form?  In a word, no.  But that doesn't mean that it's not a good time, and the film bodes well for the inevitable sequels coming our way.  Plenty of film critics have taken On Stranger Tides to task for not living up to the promises of the first film, and while their complaints are not without merit, I strongly believe the movie largely delivers.

On Stranger Tides follows multiple entities as they each lie, steal and cheat in order to make their way to the elusive Fountain of Youth, first discovered and then re-lost by Ponce De Leon nearly two centuries previous.  The entries into this mad, mad chase are the Spanish government, a coldly calculating participant, the British government, lead by former pirate Barbossa, the cutthroat Blackbeard, and of course Jack Sparrow himself.  After a rousing opening escape from the clutches of the British, Jack finds himself tracking down rumors of another Jack Sparrow who's gathering a crew in London.  The Jack Sparrow impersonator happens to be an old flame, Angelica, in costume, a play on Jack's effeminate mannerisms as well as the plethora of Jack Sparrow wannabes that walk the street on Halloween.  A nun who broke her vow of chastity to Jack, Angelica doesn't quite trust the pirate, but she needs the map to the Fountain of Youth, which happens to be in Jack Sparrow's possession.

Of course, there are a plethora of double and triple crosses that occur throughout the film.  Like a good magician, the film does a lot with just a little slight of hand.  Angelica can not exactly be trusted (or can she?), and Jack winds up in the forced servitude of the pirate Blackbeard, played with suave menace by Ian McShane.  Concerned about a prophecy about his impending death, Blackbeard is also searching out the Fountain of Youth, but in order to actually use the fountain, he must procure a tear drop from a mermaid.  In the world of the Pirates movies, mermaids are vicious creatures who put on a doe eyed veneer in order to, like the sirens, lure men to their death.  The mermaid segment is particularly well executed.  The director, Rob Marshall, uses beautiful underwater shots of the small boats that have gone out to lure the mermaids, while ratcheting up the tension.  We know from the reactions of the sailors that the mermaids are dangerous and they could strike at any moment, creating an air pregnant with tension.

With the inclusion of the mermaids, however, comes one of the film's failings, an unnecessary subplot that often tries the audience's patience.  A young missionary character who has been captured by Blackbeard is dropped like a cannonball into the middle of the film for no particular reason.  We are told who he is thanks to some leaden exposition by Angelica, and when they do finally capture a mermaid, her and the missionary start making googly eyes at one another.  The mermaid and the missionary seem like they're replacements for Will and Elizabeth, but unlike those two characters the audience has little investment in this couple.  The movie has a few other flaws as well.  The filmmakers regularly break the show not tell rule.  Captain Barbossa, for example, explains to Jack about how he lost the ship, The Black Pearl, to Blackbeard, telling him that Blackbeard's magic turned the ship against its own men, its ropes cutting down the Pearl's crew.  While he told this story, I couldn't help but think, that would have been cool to actually see, but thanks for sharing anyway Barbossa.

But despite these flaws, On Stranger Tides is a film whose desire to please is evident.  All the main actors do a fantastic job, even if McShane is elbowed out of much of the film by some unnecessary subplots.  There are also some great twists throughout the movie.  I won't spoil them for you here, but let us just say that not everyone is searching for the Fountain of Youth for eternal life.  So even when the movie stumbles, it still entertains.  On Stranger Tides is not the return to form it so desperately wants to be, but it is a nice indicator that if we are going to get at least two more of these Pirates movies, then at the very least they will serve as good summer diversions.",1330214400,,7573,4.708649468892261

4303336,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"This is a fun movie, that brings back the charm of the first Pirates movie.  On Stranger Tides caries a decent plot without dragging on or becoming too complicated.  Those who did not like At World's End or even Dead Man's Chest are likely to be pleased with On Stranger Tides.

Visuals:
The movie has very crisp clean footage and gain is almost nonexistent in the film.  The colors are bright and well balanced.  Computer visuals are well done and smoothly integrated; any computer flaws are small and do not throw you from the immersion of the film.  Unfortunately I have not had a chance to view it in 3D and thus cannot give a review on that.

Audio:
All of the audio was well mixed and balanced.  the 7.1 surround sound is crystal clear and no hiss, static, or buzz can be heard.  The mermaid section in particular stands out as far as the audio and music.  The bass feels a little underused, but that may be from the surprising lack of any cannon fire.  (Aside from one really faint one during Barbossa's tale.)

Story:
The plot works well into the Pirates of the Caribbean series without really being dependent on previous film.  If this is the first Pirates film someone sees they should not have any problem catching on or feeling lost.  Pirates 4 has less humor then its predecessors, but this is not a fault.  I feel that the film makes decided that they had run most of the jokes that they could and rather then make them feel stale or forced the focused the movie away from the absurd humor of the earlier ones.  I felt like this was a good move.  Will and Elizabeth are absent from this film, but the loss did not feel jarring or distracting.  Ian McShane and Penlope Cruz are great additions and both play their roles well adding depth to the film.  The film is not perfect, but it is a fun ride with some good action.  An enjoyable addition to the series and worth the buy for me.",1328140800,,1896,4.378223495702006

4303343,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Let me start this review by saying I really wanted to really like this film. I really did. I thought the trailer was good and had me very interested and a little excited about seeing this. I missed it during the theatrical run and recently picked up the Blu-ray.

As for the disc itself; the audio and visual quality is fantastic as is expected from this franchise and Disney Blu-ray in general. The audio is top notch and the video quality is excellent as well. I generally don't order bare bones editions like this so the lack of extras is a little disappointing but obviously wasn't a deal breaker for me. On technical merits alone this presentation is really quite good.

Now for the movie itself...I wish I could be as happy with what I watched as I was with the technical features of this disc. The film is just plain off. It seemed to me while watching it last night that there was too much action and too little story. Many of the dialogue scenes just seemed to serve the sole purpose of leading in to some sort of action piece. Honestly, it got old fast. The strongest parts of On Stranger Tides are some of the character sequences but there weren't enough of them to hold the movie together and keep it interesting. It fell flat.

The characters, most of them new, did nothing for me (with the exception of a few scenes as mentioned above). I did like the portrayal of Blackbeard by Ian McShane however. He was cast quite well and did well enough with the script presented to him to make the character a real bright spot for me. Penelope Cruz was decent but I expected more from her character and her performance in general. Most of the side characters seemed out of place and were boring. Barbosa lost his edge in this film and for the first time in the series I really was not looking forward to scenes with him in it. Even Johnny Depp seemed to have lost his magic with Captain Jack Sparrow. I don't know if that is because of the script or because it's the 4th time in this character.

With all that said there were moments of humor and good action. It just wasn't enough to make up for an otherwise empty feeling this Pirates installment left me with. I won't say it's a horrible movie, I've seen far worse. I can't say it lives up to the rest of the series though. If I had to order the movies in order of best to worst it would be as follows: Curse of the Black Pearl, At World's End, Dead Man's Chest and coming in last...On Stranger Tides.

All in all this is worth a watch if you're a fan of the series but don't expect too much. If that's how you approach viewing this, you might not be as let down as I was.",1327795200,,2629,4.28169014084507

4303389,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"Convoluted & overwritten is what would best describe this fourth installment in the Pirate's series. There are four or five partial stories in this movie, yet not one stirs any real emotional resonance or captures that ""adventurous spirit"" these films are known for. Meanwhile, all of the various plot threads align perfectly when the action sequences need connecting. It was nearly impossible for me to ""feel"" anything for any of these characters because I couldn't grasp any of their motives. C'mon, I know it's a Summer Blockbuster, but you have to like the characters a little bit, right?
Johnny Depp is so gifted, and Penelope Cruz is awesome, too! In fact, I'm sure most of the people involved with this project are extremely talented. That's what makes it so difficult to accept that they horribly misfired here. Rob Marshall's direction seems ill fitted, and too superficial. No suspense! But the two main turds here are the writers. I don't write movies. I have no clue how to do that, and yet I got an hour into this movie and started to imagine what it would have been like to focus on any one of the many subplots racing across the screen...or to focus on any one of the umpteenth relationships that were set up, and thusly tossed aside later on. My 9 year old son was bored with this film...even he had more interesting ways to get Jack Sparrow, Hector Barbossa, and Blackbeard tangled up with the infamous Fountain of Youth. How can such accomplished artists, writers, actors, and film makers, sit in an editing room, finish watching this, and then say, ""Okay...that's it! This movie is a winner!""?????
It simply blows my mind.
This is how my nine year old felt about Pirates-4: ""It's too complex. I liked most of it a little, but none of it a lot. Plus...they kept saying 'the fountain of youth' every five seconds. Oh...and shouldn't that Blackbeard guy have been WAY scarier?""
Yep. That about sums it up.",1327104000,,1921,4.737313432835821
4303390,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I thought this movie was actually quite enjoyable, and far better than the previous three. That probably has something to do with the fact that Depp's ""Jack Sparrow"" was the only character I really liked from the other films -- this is mercifully free of the love triangle that was so key to the others. It is just as full of bold adventure and outrageous stunts (some parts of this movie feel like little more than a series of elaborate, bizarre stunts) as the first, however. So be sure to watch this with your grip of reality loosed!

The movie (some spoilers) centers around a quest to find the fountain of youth. As with the other movies, these mythical things aren't just ""find this and all your problems are gone""...there's a darker element here as well. Cue in monstrous mermaids, nefarious ne'er-do-wells, wicked wastrels, and our favorite pansy pirate. ;)

The regular 2D blu-ray only has a few of the special features, while this 3D version comes with a bonus disc full of content that us die-hard Pirates fans were hoping for. It includes a behind-the-scenes documentary, similar to the ones made for the first three Pirates films. It also includes several featurettes that go into more detail on certain sequences, such as building the set for the epic climax of the film, or the highly technical aspects of bringing the mermaids to life. None of these features are available on the 2D blu-ray version, so even if you don't have a 3D-capable TV (I don't), I still recommend this 3D package (the 2D version is included in this package) for anyone wanting to know more about the making of this chapter of the franchise.",1326499200,4,1070,4.520618556701031

However, while Jack is in possession of neither ship nor crew, (and the film is without former cast members Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley who elected to pursue other projects) Sparrow's captors are under the impression that he has a ship and is presently amassing a crew. Sparrow investigates and discovers someone impersonating him for their own purposes. A woman, of all things. In fact, a woman from his past by the name of Angelica (played by Penelope Cruz).

  Clearly the story is complicated and the viewer is asked to make many accommodations where plausibility and time are concerned.

4303409,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Sometimes when a franchise hits its 4th in the series many are burnt out including Johnny Depp yet he still pulls through and gives a great performance.  After all how much Pirates can one take?  Still I found myself being pulled into this movie.  It did what it was meant to do.  Entertain.  I wondered how this one would be without the  other two main actors from the three previous Pirate films, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, but it wasn't long into the film before I forgot that they existed.  In fact, if anything this film proved was that they're not needed at all.  Johnny Depp and exceptional new addition, Penelope Cruz carry this film on their strong shoulders without effort and for them this film is an adventure.  Those two worked together in a film called ""Blow"" many years ago.  In this Pirate film we're given Mermaids.  These aren't your innocent mythical creatures you associate Mermaids to be though.  They appear that way at first, but can be deadly fatal as well.  There is also Blackbeard making an appearance as a nasty Pirate racing the crew to capture the Fountain of Youth and killing any that get in his way.  Geoffrey Rush is back and can always carry his own, yet they have him looking uncomfortably pasty in this.  The action sequences are so digitized that it sucks the fun right out of them.  I miss the days when the actors actually trained to sword fight and it looked authentic.  Now they have nasty computer generated effects tampering with the fight sequences and it shows.  Aside from that quip, Stranger Tides works nicely as a Pirate film that I'm happy to include in the collection.",1326326400,2,1628,4.6328671328671325

I have watched all four in the series and whilst I thought the previous three were okay, the characters played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom really ruined the stories (in my opinion).  This film however focuses more on Captain Jack Sparrow (played by Johnny Depp) and Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush) and has two new main characters - Blackbeard and his daughter.

This film seemed to move much faster than the previous three and was much funnier.  Depp is a genius in this film; love him or hate him, he won't fail to make you laugh.  I highly recommend it.",1325808000,,641,4.539130434782609

4303450,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"There were many things I liked about this film. I love Capt. Jack and found his antics funny, as usual. I also loved the mermaids (the song the first one sings is beatiful and haunting) and just the overall LOOK of the film. There were some great action sequences and I thought the introduction of Blackbeard was well done. Penelope Cruz (whom I was worried about before I saw this...I mean, a love interest for Jack Sparrow? Dicey) did a great job and I liked her character.

Some things I didn't like...the 'zombie' crew of Blackbeard's. They aren't explained (the rest of the crew is tricked into serving) and I can see no reason why they couldn't just have been regular pirates. The Spanish...why are they there? They aren't really a threat and their appearance at the end seems to be for no reason other than to speed up the ending by creating a bit of extra tension. They seemed more like plot devices than part of the story. And then, loathe though I am to admit it (being a pretty big fan of the first three movies) but I felt like a lot of this movie had been seen before. I mean, many characters reappear (but not Will and Elizabeth, which I thought was sad), and many of the action sequences felt that they'd been done before -- there's the 'Jack flying through the air to escape (twice!)), the ship being destroyed, the hiking through the tropical island, etc.

Overall, I think it was a good movie and I'll probably buy it at some point if for nothing else than I Love Jack Sparrow and the mermaids were amazing. Did this movie NEED to be made? No. Is it as good as the other three? No. But it's still worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of the other films.",1325721600,3,1675,4.382636655948553

First off, this installment is Darker then its predecesors. Ian McShane enjoys and does Very Well playing Evil characters. Like its predecessors the movie plays a little fst and loose with history, but you cannot take any of these films too seriously or you ""will not"" like them. Johnny Depp has ""perfected"" his Jack Sparrow character. The dialogue is Fun with some clever innuendo. Geoffrey Rush is ""Splendid"" once again as Barbossa, and the Pirate chatter between him and the crew is hilarious as always. Now, for the negatives: The mermaid characters having vampire teeth was ""Silly"" to me....I guess because there are so many vampire movies and TV shows these days. The story about a Fountain of Youth....You need a mermaid's tears plus the water from the fountain to live forever? I Love the mystical side of these movies....I love the chase scenes and the swordplay....I thought Penelope Cruz was amazing considering that she was carrying a child at the time the movie was filmed!

4303510,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I love this franchise of POTC and I will watch it forever. Only because of Jack Sparrow to be honest, he really makes these movies. I am sure if a character like Jack Sparrow were not in these movies, the franchise would go no where.

Why do I say this? Well first of all, the first and second movie were my favorites out of the 4 movies so far. The third one seemed a bit eerie, but it was still fun.

There were a lot of things in this movie I was not expecting, the plot wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be. However, this 4th movie looks like it took ideas from all 3 movies and put it into the 4th movie, but changed it around. (POSSIBLE SPOILER) Even where the Fountain of Youth was, it looked like where the treasure chest of the Aztec gold was found from the first movie, it's the exact same set LOL!

I found it interesting they tried to put in a small love story into this movie, to make up for Will and Elizabeth.

Only for so long these types of movies can go on before they are deemed boring. The whole ""Different parties searching for the same thing for different reasons, but things turn out different at the end"".

(POSSIBLE SPOILER) The ending actually reminded me of the first movie. It was so similar.

I rented it, and if you do not have a good internet connection, you will not see it in good quality.

Though let me put it this way, if this was the first movie and Jack Sparrow wasn't an amazing character, it would not have turned into a billion dollar franchise.",1324425600,2,1496,4.20979020979021

4303537,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"I think this series has definitely run its course. I love Johny Depp, but even his charms cannot save this film. The plot is basically another variation on the treasure hunt, although this time they are looking for the fountain of youth. Capt. Barbossa, played again by Geoffrey Rush, is also after it, allied with the British crown. Blackbeard, played by Ian McShane, is the third contender and he's accompanied by his daughter, played by Penelope Cruz. Although it's basically a simple plot, there are various twists and turns that are hard to follow, partly because of the strong accents. My husband couldn't follow it all, having not seen the prior film, and I'm not sure I did either. It also simply dragged on too long - it seemed a little caught up in itself, and the cast seemed a little caught up in themselves (most of the time having more fun than us I suspect.)

The settings and special effects are great though, as they have been in the other films. A mermaid scene is especially impressive, and helped save this film from 1 or 2 star status for me. I also liked the chemistry between Cruz and Depp, and their interactions were a highlight of the film. So it's a 3 star for me. I think I'm done with this franchise though, I hope the studio agrees.",1324166400,,1262,4.510917030567685

4303540,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"If there is one thing that is consistent with ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", you know that this film will make a ton of money in the box office.

And while many thought that the ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" was finished with the third film in the trilogy, ""At World's End"" would be the last we would see of Jack Sparrow.  But the truth is, that no matter how film critics have shown their declining interest in the film, the audience have not.

And with the release of the fourth film ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"", once again, the audience have shown their love for this film as it became the 8th highest grossing film of all time (worldwide), the third highest grossing film of 2011 and following ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""Toy Story 3', the third highest grossing film for Disney.  The film  which cost anywhere between $150-$250 million to make, earned over $1 billion in the box office.

VIDEO:

""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  And as one can expect from Disney, the picture quality is fantastic.  The majority of the film is shot outdoors, at sea or during day or night and for the most part, detail is high, skin tones are natural and blacks are deep and inky.

And once again, cinematographer Dariusz Wolski should receive credit for his spectacular cinematography, from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films to ""Alice in Wonderland"", Wolski is an expert in shooting in the darkest of scenes, underwater, in smoke and chaotic sequences and there is no artifacts, banding or any problematic situations in the picture quality at all.

Overall, ""On Stranger Tides"" is a fantastic looking film and looks absolutely wonderful on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

What best than to present this film with a lossless English, French and Spanish 7.1 DTS-HD HR presentation.  The surround channels are heavily used in Hans Zimmer's wonderful score to the swordfights, the sound of boots walking on the deck, the sound of blasts, the growl of the mermaids and scenery ambiance, and throughout all this immersive sound, dialogue is crystal clear and understandable.

The LFE for the film is wonderful and like the wonderful picture quality of the film, the lossless audio soundtrack is also fantastic!

Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When it comes to popcorn action films ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" manages to incorporate the fun, swashbuckling action of Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp does a wonderful job of playing Jack Sparrow.  But one's enjoyment is subjective, especially whether or not you have felt that your passion for the film series is starting to wane a bit.

After the third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" film, I have to say that ""At World's End"" left me feeling bitter because it was not a great film to end the trilogy.  But because these films make a tremendous amount of money, there is no way that we are going to see an end to this film series.  In fact, a fifth film is being planned and Johnny Depp is returning, so as long as the audience continues to come out to see the films, I don't see why Disney should stop.  People still love ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".

Personally, I enjoyed the film but unlike previous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, it felt a bit light when it came to Jack Sparrow because there is so much emphasis on other characters.  In fact, I found myself enjoying scenes with the Christian Philip  (played by Sam Claflin)and the mermaid Syrena (played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey), which for me was the replacement characters for Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters for the previous films).  But unfortunately, where Turner and Swann had staying power for three films, not sure if we are going to see Philip or Syrena ever again.

While ""On Stranger Tides"" continues to be a fun, adventurous popcorn action film, I did enjoy seeing Penelope Cruz playing the character of Angelica Teach, a compassionate/cutthroat ex-lover of Jack Sparrow and Ian McShane as the legendary dark pirate Blackbeard was quite fun to watch as well.  And seeing Barbosa, it was no surprise to see his return to the film as well.

But ""On Stranger Tides"" tries to showcase many other characters as well and truth be told, aside from Gibbs who has a place in the PotC films, everyone else didn't.  For example, in the first film, there was a sympathetic feeling towards Sparrow and his crew, but this time around, you really had no sympathy for anyone's crew.  If anything, you just wondered when will Jack Sparrow be back on his ship instead of being Indiana Jones/Blackbeard's grunt.  This is one side of Jack Sparrow that we have not seen in previous films and I'm not sure if I like him in such a non-commanding role.

But however one feels about ""On Stranger Tides"", similar to films like ""Transformers"", these are popcorn action films that people come to see and have a good time, not for anything deep or mind-blowing.  You get action and a ton of special effects and in that sense, ""On Stranger Tides"" does not disappoint.

But when it comes to this Blu-ray release, one thing that does disappoint is the fact that we are getting far less than the five disc version when it comes to special features.  Picture and lossless audio is fantastic but I was surprised to see only three special features including the audio commentary included with this release.  But it appears that Disney really is pushing for the 3D 5-disc version which has nine special features over its 2-disc counterpart which has only three minus the second screen.

Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a fun film and from the crew fight on the Queen Anne's Revenge, Jack Sparrow's escape from British custody to the encounter with the mermaids, there are many fun action scenes in this film.  But in terms of story, I still prefer the first original film, but there is no doubt that the visuals and overall production design is much improved in this latest film.

If you are a fan of the series and own the trilogy on Blu-ray, or you are just a big fan of the film or its talent, you're definitely going to want this film in your collection.  But if you are wanting the best version of this film released on Blu-ray, you may want to look into the 5-disc version over this 2-disc combo pack as Disney chose to include most of the bonus features on the 5-disc release.",1323993600,8,7453,4.822187254130606

They showed the sneak previews of this movie OVER and OVER again, and I wass going to skip it at the theatres and wait for the DVD (which I did).  I finally purchased this when it was for sale as a regular DVD.  I didn't buy the 3 pack combo.  I was suprized at how intrested I became in the plot of Jack Sparrow in this addition.  I enjoy Johnny Depp's acting and so I wasn't disappointed in this movie.  The supporting actors and actresses did great as well.  From Penelope Cruz as a pirate and former love, to Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa and Ian McShane as the infamous Blackbeard.  The plot has twists and turns that keep your interest.  The locations and special effects in the movie are good and amusing.  The end is not bad (though you can tell who is not going to make it).

While I am happy that Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley did not return for this film (don't get me wrong, I like their characters, but what other stories could they tell with these characters?), the addition of Cruz seemed a bit out of sorts. Even though the romantic history and sexual tension was there between her and Jack, I still didn't really believe it. She seemed more like just another enemy in disguise, almost Jack's equal. McShane was good as Blackbeard. The other thing that threw me off was the side story of Sam Claflin's Philip and strid Bergs-Frisbey's mermaid Syrena, which was a great aspect of the film. However, their story ends with no real closure or clue as to their fates. It's as if the writers just forgot all about them. After seeing this, I was hoping that the film series would come to an end, but, with the post-credits scene, I fear we still have more to come from this dying franchise.",1323734400,6,1065,4.5811518324607325

Fountain of youth - mermaids - pirates - curses - galleons on mountainsides and skeletal corpses comfortable in bed.

Stranger than reality certainly, but done such with such flair and aplomb, attention to detail and quality dynamics within the cast that it simply draws the viewer along for the duration, almost a couple of hours of enthralling escapism.

A few of the priciples are still on cast from the first ""pirates"", but there's new faces as well. All work together to pull of the movie.

The sets from old London to and abondoned beached ship work very well, the attention to detail is superb and the comic lampooning of England's mad king George is even managed in an understated tastefully hilarious fashion.

This rates high on the list when compared to the other ""pirates"" movies, and if you even remotely enjoyed the others you'll probably agree this was worth both the wait and the price.

As to price, the underlying and very subtle message of the movie is that there is a price to pay for everything, even immortality.

4303559,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Disney has gotten a whole lot of mileage out of the Pirates franchise, considering it's based on one of its amusement park rides, and this fourth installment would test the true star power of not only its lead actor, Johnny Depp, but the saucy, wisecracking Jack Sparrow. How so? Well, with On Stranger Tides, Depp would have to make a go of it without three-time co-stars Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, as well as director Gore Verbinski, who had also helmed all three previous films. No, this time around, Jack Sparrow would have to contend with Angelica, a woman from his past who may be out to con him, and the fearsome pirate Blackbeard in a Rob Marshall-directed quest to discover the Fountain of Youth. As it turns out, On Stranger Tides is the worst of all the Pirates films, and it made the least amount of money at the box office, but when you consider the performance of the first three installments, which all had diminishing box office returns and got progressively worse, it's not quite so bad. Despite its jumbled plot and overabundance of noisy action sequences, Pirates 4 still earned a worldwide sum of over $1 billion, so if all you needed was a little more Jack Sparrow, this will suit you just fine.",1323648000,4,1224,4.645161290322581

Some of the key characters from the predecessors are gone and some are are back in Stranger Tides...while director Gore Verbinski is out and Rob Marshall is in. Together the cast and crew still manage to keep the franchise alive and entertaining

The special effects are great. The movies are visually spectacular with realistic looking at-sea adventure featuring legendary pirates, ghosts, sea monsters and now mermaids...I'd say the amazing effects actually contribute a full star to all of the Pirates movies in this series. There's lots of silliness in the Pirates movies, but it's deliberate. There's slapstick. There are death-defying feats. There's Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) doing his best imitation of Keith Richards (true factoid, he has publicly commented that Richards is his Jack Sparrow character persona inspiration...and by now everyone knows who notice who plays Captain Teague, right?). And all the silliness mostly works. After all, this is Disney and indeed supposed to be a movie for kids too, no?

I find it amazing that On Stranger Tides alone has grossed over $1,000,000,000 (that's a BILLION dollars according to Box Office Mojo). It's a good movie that kids can watch too so that's certainly a recipe for success. But a billion dollars?!? Wow. On Stranger Tides, At World's End and Dead Man's Chest are more between a 3 and 4 star rating than the solid 4 star that Curse of the Black Pearl would earn alone. But numbers don't lie. People are drawn to this franchise. I am drawn to this franchise. So bottom line: all four movies offer like 9 hours of time that can be spent nuzzling up with your kids.

No, this franchise's ship has not sailed...yet. It continues to please audiences and of course carries an ending that suggests that it has at least one more life left in it. Hence, my recommendation: Add the Pirates series to your cart (and hope that it doesn't take another 4 years for the next installment).",1323648000,2,2372,5.253298153034301

But I like this Pirates movie as much as the first one because of Jack Sparrow.  For the first time, he is THE good guy--as selfish as ever, but a character you like because his enemies are even worse and because of his random, unpredictable, silly personality.  Johnny Depp has a real genius for playing him.  This Pirates movie also has the advantage of Penelope Cruz as Angelica, a much more interesting character than the snobbish Elizabeth Swan.  She is somewhat devout but somewhat treacherous.  This one's also much better than the 2nd and 3rd ones because it has a story that actually makes sense, whereas the 3rd was like the Twilight Zone, in effect ruining the 2nd which was building up to it.  The ending on this, unlike the 2nd, is satisfying even though unresolved.  Most of all, this Pirates impressed me after my disgust with #'s 2 and 3 because of its clever dialogue between Jack Sparrow and other people, and with the originality and humor of his escapades.  The director is effective and uses close-ups of Jack to the maximum comic effect.

4303648,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"This review is for the Single Disc DVD version which is simply awful quality-wise.  I assume we must wait for the two-disc (or whatever) special edition version to get a watchable picture.  Most of the film appears as if shot at midnight through a dark filter.  While Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz do a fine job carrying forward their characters, it would have been nice to be able to see the performances rather than spend most of the viewing time listening to their dialog without benefit of anything more than a shadowy image or the occasional glint of a sword blade.  Yes. I am aware of 18th century pub lighting but 21st century photography is usually capable of better things when confronted with such difficult filming.  Some really good by-play was lost to the dark.

Also lost in this film were several minor but important characters who could and should have been continued.  The two hapless English fusiliers made a great filler contribution to the previous films as did the ""Parlay?"" pirate and his one-eyed confrere.  Their absence is felt.  It is well that Blackbeard dies as Ian McShane while looking evil makes a very poor pirate and looks lost while not in Deadwood.  Barbossa is much too good and broad a character to be restricted to being a slimy Royal Navy syncophant.  Geoffrey Rush might have contemplated giving speech lessons to the George II character who was played by an absolutely incomprehensible oaf.

Perhaps all the darkness was substituted by the director and the writers instead of illuminating us as to some finer points of the plot which was left quite turgid at best.  Mermaids indeed!

The majority of the effects are after the first half hour of the film.
Honorable mention effects included swords being thrust through a door (20%) or being pointed towards you (30% 3 times), a boney hand (30%), flakes falling from an explosion (25%), and the grumpy monkey (25%). There is also a real nice 10% sequence involving a water drop.

The 3D in itself is very good but Disney did struggle with scene framing, focusing and lighting, to best benefit a 3D film. I should clarify that the focusing issue is just the blurring of foreground objects to draw the viewers' attention to where the director wants it. This tactic has been used a lot in recent years for normal movies but it is just not conducive to a good 3D viewing experience.

Don't get me wrong, this is a worthy addition to any 3D collection. 3D cartoons are easy to produce but for real life 3D, there is a definite learning curve.

***  Jack and the gang are great in 3D  ***

MY 3D RATING = VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

4303656,3,B004A8ZWUQ,The first Pirates movie is the best and there is no argument about that. The second was not as good and the third was even worse. The fourth is somewhere between the second and third. The story is pretty bad and doesn't make much sense. Captain Jack is the only likeable character and everyone else is pretty nonexistent. I would not buy this for full price because it is not worth it. This movie felt like a cash in and the story should have been rewritten or let the franchise die.,1322179200,,483,4.318681318681318

I know some people didn't realy dig the second or some the third, but at least I felt that I was watching the continuing adventure of the most dysfunctional swabbies to ever sail the Spanish main and remained true to their calling and idiocies.

I thought it was fine that Orlando and Kiera were no longer attached to Jacks adventure, but every funny man needs a straight man and this time there was none. Even Barbossa, clubbing around like Ahab seemed to have lost his appetite for adventure and acted ever the old sea captain who needed to be put in the old pirates home. My grandmother was meaner then Blackbeard and Penelope Cruz was, well, just was.

This movie was a chance for the screenwriters to take Depps talent and maybe have made a more serious film about the decline of piracy as a way of life something Captain Barbossa seemed to feel was in the air, and maybe Jacks dealing with that.

4303694,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Better than 3, maybe 2 but not 1 of the series. Most of the old gang is back and this time they're seeking the Fountain of Youth but lots of other parties are involved in the mad race to this mythical location. Depp is his usual Captain Jack Sparrow, Rush is a bit more refined but still a rascal underneath it all and Ian McShane gets a nice introduction. Penelope Cruz may have been the weakest of the main stars and somebody should have given her some more practice with a sword because she just didn't look right. That said, it's a romanticized version of the life of a pirate so you have to sort of take it all in good fun. The tale was well constructed and better than most blockbuster films. Believe it or not models with natural curves were brought in to play the mermaids, including Gemma Ward as their creepy leader. The latter half was a lot more interesting than the first half. Inspired by a Tim Power's novel. Apparently it was Depp's idea to have the Spanish follow the protagonists in the tale but don't worry the writers did their share of the work. As usual for a blockbuster that does well the critics mostly slammed it and once again show they aren't in touch with the masses. The cost of this film was somewhere between 150-250M but it made over $1B at the box office. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE (based on archetypes): B plus; SPECIAL EFFECTS/ACTION: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: today; OVERALL GRADE: B plus. BEST DIALOGUE: Jack Sparrow: [to Angelica] I thought I should give you warning. We're taking the ship. It's nothing personal. /// Angelica: You were the only pirate I thought I could get away with.

4303695,2,B004A8ZWUQ,the story was redundant and long. I was yawning thru most of the movie. disney should stop this series b4 they end up making 6 more or something.,1321920000,,145,4.214285714285714
4303696,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"First, and most importantly, Depp has gotten into a rut, whereas his previous performances in the Pirates series had a novel, wacky, spontaneous nature to them this performance seemed too rehearsed, too practiced. It lacked imagination, energy and fantasy. One example, was his hanging on to a banner and running/riding on horse drawn carts and platforms. Besides being an old and tired routine it seemded added just to inject some energy into what was a pretty tiresome movie. Other than her physical appearance Cruz added little to the movie.

Second, part of that can be attributed to the script which lacked imagination and the dark, foreboding comedy and fantasy we've come to expect. The Cruz as daughter, the mermaids and the fountain-of-youth subplots seemed to be something borrowed as a shortcut through a lack of creative effort; to show us something truly fantastical. The mermaid graphics besides being cheap looking seemed more appropriate for showcasing a Victoria's Secret modeling exhibition. The sword fighting scenes looked like a high school stage revue. And, of course, the same old tavern look. Thus the hackneyed flow to the story. But of course this is a Disney movie so there's no secret to where the monied priorities lie.

A very forgettable continuation of the series. That is often the case when the sequels continue primarily because they've become an easily reworked cash cow.",1321920000,12,1407,5.139737991266376

4303728,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"What do the critics know? If critics pan a film it makes me want to see for myself even more.
Johnny Depp and some of the old cast do not disappoint here. Granted; Jack Sparrow is looking long in the tooth these days (who doesn't!)but it's a hard life being the worlds greatest Pirate! Geoffrey Rush is in his usual fine form as his his character Barbossa which I personally think could and should be some sort of spinoff! (Are you listening Disney?) Ian McShane doesn't steal the show but fits right in as though he was born for the role, and narry a curse word used. Penelope Cruz was a fresh breath of air. We missed Ms. Knightley, but life goes on. We were disappointed with one thing though...the monkey only had a cameo!

Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow did not seem quite as mentally crazy as in the past movies which to me is half the fun of the previous movies.

4303732,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"If you ever needed proof why you shouldn't listen to critics, the Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, part 4 in the series, is it.  Part 2 and part 3 received quite a thrashing from critics despite still cashing in pretty big at the box office.  So, there's no reason why they would treat part 4 any different.  But that's just it.  It is different. Without Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, whom you won't even miss having in this film, you should expect a new storyline and new characters and that's exactly what you get.  Barbossa and Gibbs are back, but other than Captain Jack, Jack the Monkey, and even a cameo from Jack's father (Keith Richards), you have a whole new cast of characters.

The film picks up with the same plot where the last one left off, with the Fountain of Youth being the focus.  Captain Jack escapes the gallows with Gibbs only to discover someone is impersonating him and getting a crew together to go find the fountain. The imposter turns out to be Angelica Teach (Penelope Cruz), the daughter of Blackbeard (Ian McShane) who wants to find the fountain to save her father from a doomed prophecy.

Angelica and Jack apparently have a past love interest together and she tricks him into joining the crew because she knows he has the map and that he's been to the fountain.  But to get the spell of the fountain to work, they'll have to collect certain items that are needed, including the tear of a mermaid.  So, the movie becomes a race for Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish, and the English, to collect the items needed and get to the fountain first!

Blackbeard is a colorful and well played evil pirate.  You can expect the same entertainment that you got from Davy Jones and Barbossa in the previous films.  Cruz definitely holds her own in the cast of men.  Depp is Jack through and through, prancing about and always cleverly escaping trouble.  And Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa again is up to his old conniving tricks, undercover on the English side,  despite having a peg leg now.

The movie provides lots of fast paced action mainly in the form of sword fights and doesn't rely heavily on special effects like the last film. And then there are the mermaids!  The intense and evil beauties which provide a large part of entertainment in the middle of the film, and even a small romantic subplot that grabs your attention.

There's an equal amount of time spent on land and at sea, and although the movie had a slow start as it set up the plot, I would almost say this one was better than the last one. If you are a fan of the other films, you will definitely be entertained and think that this film is a great addition to the series.",1321747200,,2673,4.508298755186722

I don't care if they are putting in comments like ""Blu-Ray only"" or ""Doesn't include DVD"".  They shouldn't be selling them under the heading of a product listed as a multidisk combo set...

4303769,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"On stranger tides follows the continuing story of Jack Sparrow after the end of At World's End. Taking place several years later, after Jack's map lead him to a dead end, he continues the search for the fountain of youth. I could say that the movie was OK, but suffered from several issues that just did not put it on par with any of the previous movies.

The first issue was the antagonist, Blackbeard. Although he had a dramatic intro, after that, his character just waned. He was not intimidating, scary, or even particularly piraty. At no point could they decide what supernatural powers to give him, so they toss him a giant hodgepodge of whatever was convenient at the time. As a result, one minute he has the mystical power to control rope, another moment he can shrink ships into bottles, another moment he can resurrect the dead, no, he can make voodoo dolls, wait, he can control the wind? His ship has... a flamethrower? They claim him to be evil, and spend the entire movie declaring how evil he is... but he doesn't perform a single evil act in the entire movie. He kills a mutineer and captures and leaves to die a vicious mermaid who murders people... that's it. Other than that, for a pirate, he was actually a pretty decent guy.

This leads to the next problem, they make all the other characters ""good"" so that Blackbeard seems evil in comparison. Pirates and thieves are suddenly altruistic and noble. Blackbeard's evil deed is being the only character in the movie that actually acted like a pirate, and not even a good one. This comes nowhere near the backstabbing, thieving, and traitorousness of the pirates of the first three movies. Suddenly Jack and Barbossa are best chums, this new girl which people keep saying added ""much needed sex appeal"" Angelica looks like a Latino stunt double of Swan. Her motivations, once again, despite being allegedly corrupted in evil, are completely altruistic and unpirate like.

The final issue is how every scene was done. I swear the directors and writers sat down with the scripts of the first three movies and said, what is your favorite scenes from each movie and how can we shove them all into one? Oh, I loved the scene where the Kraken grabs all those people up. Ok, let's have that scene with magical ropes instead. Oh, I love that scene where will and jack fight on the roof planks in the blacksmith shop. Sounds good, let's do that again with Jack and that Angelica. How about that scene where Davy Jones pulls out the long cannons. Great! We'll make it a flamethrower instead! What about the scene where Jack escapes the soldiers. Sure, but we'll have him escape from the middle of the estate now! What about the turner/swan love interest. Yeah, we can throw some altruistic guy in their so he can sloppily be corrupted by pirates while falling in love with an ""unattainable"" woman outside his station.

So yeah. That was the story. We have the antiheroes who have just turned into heroes, the bad guy that is little worse than any of the good guys, ""needed"" sex appeal that looks no different than the last 3 movies, except latin now. We have almost scene for scene grabs from the original trilogy, more poorly done and in the case of the relationship, was so out of place it could have just been left out.

I give it 3 stars, because it was an OK watch, had it's fun moments with Jack Sparrow, and there was occasionally some witty dialogue or interesting scenes. However, ultimately completely unnecessary and anyone who love the trilogy could completely go without watching this.

Edit: I figured I should add that Angelica, the latin girl, played by Penelope Cruz, an established actor, acts like, dresses like, and functions like swan from the second two movies. I am not comparing the actors... but that she was clearly a shoed in replacement for the swan character (scriptwise) and never really developed a personality of her own, I hope that solves the confusion.",1320883200,42,3945,4.677233429394812

To put it bluntly, this movie is not even close in quality to any of the previous films. The loss of Will an Elizabeth is unnoticed. The best character was Jack Sparrow and everyone knew it, but should a whole movie be based off one character? His quirky mannerisms and quick witted humor were great in the other three movies, but it starts to feel stale in this one. A little goes along way. I found that those Jack quick witted mini lectures and jokes got a bit silly when that is all you hear for two hours. Unfortunately, the supporting cast is dull. A lot of the characters from the first three are back including barbossa and Jacks first mate (that one guy who I cant remember his name, the one who has those two lacky screw ups, you know the one). They add nothing here. They never have and were always decent fill in characters. This time Jack gets a lady counterpart, Penelope Cruz. Cruz is ridiculous. She is not necessarily bad, but just boring. She is there to look cute and make pouty faces. She is supposed to be the female Jack Sparrow. However, during her fight scenes, I never believed it for an instant. It just looked silly as did the rest of the action which takes place somewhere between the quick cuts in the editing room. In the first action scene, Jack escapes the King. He scurries up the wall and dives out the window, hopping on top of carriages. He lands on a sign in front of a bar. He falls down. UH OH!!! There is a bad guy. BOOM. What? Why it is Jacks father....conveniently there to kill the bad guy. They have a quick discussion in the bar. Jack turns and...........his father is gone. What? ok......Jack learns of someone of importance that is in the other room. OH NO! Its a Jack imposter. 6 minutes later....oh, its Penelepe Cruz pretending to be Jack. Where am I going with all of this? I don't know and I wish the movie did to. The film is a disjointed mess all the way to the fountain of youth which is accessed by a ceiling pool. Yes, a ceiling pool. You have to go through the ceiling. Again, yes. They must have felt foolish because the Spaniards were in there to except they didn't have to climb through the ceiling water.

The use of 3D is very well rounded though there is perhaps less depth to the image than one might expect in a live action film such as this.",1320192000,,363,4.126760563380282

4303808,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"The Pirates of the Caribbean movies are all lots of fun, kind of creepy and very funny (mostly due to Captain Johnny/Jack Depp/Sparrow), but of late they've become convoluted and serpentine. I watched the second and third films with a kind of glaze, not really following the storylines at all, but just drifting from set piece to set piece, enjoying the ride but not really keeping track of what was going on.

Remedying this was among the marching orders of new-to-Pirates director Rob Marshall, a virtuoso musical film director in an era in which such craftsmen are few and far between. He's perhaps the only director capable in recent years of making good, solid musicals that even the non-fan can enjoy - among them the acclaimed TV version of Annie and the Oscar winning Chicago.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is, in effect, a musical without songs. And it works perfectly (unlike 1972's Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, which was supposed to be a musical, and 1961's Fanny, which should have been but had its song torn out). Like a classic Hollywood or British musical film, it's lavishly mounted with magnificent sets and grand costumes. Even the dirty, filthy settings are meticulously detailed (and all look amazing in Blu-ray). The characters are larger than life, the action scenes are inventively choreographed and the story stays simple to allow for all the elements to take the forefront.

On Stranger Tides has a refreshingly linear plot -- the search for the Fountain of Youth, and it has a staple element of musicals: the dual couples. Oklahoma! had Laurie, Curly, Ado Annie and Will, The Sound of Music had Maria, the Captain, Liesl and Rolf -- and this film has Jack, Angelica, Philip and Syrena. All the elements fall beautifully into place.

On the Blu-ray audio commentary (thank you, bonus feature people!), director Rob Marshall and executive producer John DeLuca express their (and Johnny Depp's) fondness for movies, expressing their excitement of using the very same beach made famous by Deborah Kerr and Burt Lancaster in From Here to Eternity, the remains of a hotel where Elvis appeared in Blue Hawaii and more. It's nice when the movie makers are fond of the genre and the project to which they are assigned. It shows.

Penelope Cruz makes her Pirates debut with panache, power, beauty and even some warmth (deep, expressive eyes), though I would have liked to see her given more humor. She proved to be capable of sparring with Sparrow -- and gets in quite a few good lines -- but for some reason, there is a tendency for modern films to confuse feminine strength with dourness. Behold the perfect combination Diana Rigg in the 60's series The Avengers and you'll see what I mean.

Love to have the commentary included, but otherwise not a ton of extras, which is a bit of a surprise. Overall though, one of the series' best.",1319846400,,2872,4.8272357723577235
4303809,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Well, here I go again with the comments I have been forced to input since fall 2009.

What is Disney thinking?  This Release ONLY blu-ray packages BUT we DVD people have to sit & wait for that package?

Terrible.  I hope Disney loses a lot of money again because of this idiot choice.
I can NOT afford regular DVD's, how can I afford blu-rays?

The film is decent.  Jumps around is she or isn't she with Cruz.  At least she can say she has a hit box office movie now.

The changing of the Rush's character.  Been in all the films but they keep messing with the character.  And, his character was not even spoken of on the promotional part on the DVD case.

It is okay to surprise your audience, but the story jumps EVERY TWO SECONDS get to be a bit much.

Johnny can do the Jack character in his sleep.  Bringing Keith Richards back for a cameo.  Only other past character coming back was Gibbs.

Now, this LAME, CHEAP BLU-RAY PACKAGE.
Yep, I paid an expensive amount of money for a OLD DAYS BUT NOT FOR DISNEY PLAIN SILVER DVD & A COLORFUL FRISBEE.

Back when DVD's came out in the late 1990's remember Disney films had colorful discs.  BUT EVERYONE IS DOING BLU-RAY DISNEY.  Does anyone think Walt would have allowed there cheap looking DVD's to be released if he was still alive?  No, I do NOT think so.

How about these plastic cases WITH THE INTENTIONAL HOLES IN THEM.  CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP. So discs can be damaged SO YOU ARE FORCED TO BUY ANOTHER.

No chapter list, any information on the film.

Film is fine, best of course is still the 2003 original.  But, DISNEY DVD PEOPLE ARE STILL OUT HERE SO RELEASE THEM PROPERLY & STOP THE CUTTING OF CORNERS.",1319846400,,1657,4.339869281045751
4303810,4,B004A8ZWUQ,From being informed that this movie was not as good as the previous ones I was skeptical about buying it. But I was surprisingly happy for purchasing it. It was better than what I was expecting and besides...with Johnny Depp play Jack Sparrow you cant go wrong.,1319846400,,261,4.574468085106383
4303811,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Well, I finally saw POTC IV.  I missed it in theatres, so I avoided seeing any reviews until I saw it on DVD.  As someone who absolutely idolizes Jack Sparrow, I thought a movie devoted to him would be awesome.

Sadly, I was wrong.  The first 3 movies were all 5/5.  This one doesn't come close, and for one very simple reason.  Any fan of Jack Sparrow loves unpredictability.  Johnny Depp certainly wasn't at fault, he played the part exactly as before.  But the way it was written, you knew what was going to happen well before it actually happened.  In a movie featuring Jack Sparrow as your single major character, predictability is a real buzzkill.  Also, while he was something of a ""chessmaster"" in the trilogy, here, he just bumbles around.  His tactical skills are clearly still intact, though his overall strategic abilities are left out.  He's not a king, just an incredibly clever pawn.

The overall impression I got from the film was that it just screamed to cash in on the POTC name.  Blackbeard is nothing compared to Davy Jones (no fault on Ian McShane, who was clearly as villainous as the script allowed), Barbossa is no Beckett, and the Spanish are no real 3rd party.  The only change was they changed the token hot chick from Keira Knightley to Penelope Cruz, which doesn't matter since they're both good actresses and both pretty damn hot.",1319673600,2,1360,4.65546218487395
4303812,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"After 7 years we return back to the days of Captain Jack Sparrow and the swashbuckling mayhem of Pirates of the Caribbean. Under new leadership of Rob Marshal and replacing Orlando Bloom & Kiera Knightly (For now) with Ian McShane & Penelope Cruz it makes for another action packed, laugh filled Pirates adventure.

Simply put, if you have seen the first 3 and you liked the first 3, then 'On Stranger Tides' will be movie you will like as well. I was glad that they went back to the first film and realized that a simple easy to follow story is better than something overly complicated. Having Johnny Depp & Geoffrey Rush do what they do best as Jack and Barbosa, it's a winner. Still, the fact that it is just another 'Pirates of the Caribbean', well it may not always be a good thing.

So apparently there will be a possible Pirates 5 & 6 as a ""New Trilogy"" I am wondering where the next adventure will be.",1319587200,4,909,4.372781065088757

Keep up the good work and I do hope they can find another adventure for Captain Jack. I could even watch Captain Jack grow old. He will still be the greatest. This one was as good as the first one. The third one I really didn't really care for but I still have it. As long as it has Captain Jack in it. You are funny and refreshing. Thanks.,1319587200,,458,3.9782608695652173

4303816,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"for starters, I like the movie.  The movie on its own is worth 4 stars.  For me it was just shy of 5 stars because it felt less than the other 3 movies.  What bothers me is the way Disney is releasing the movie, in fact how a lot of home releases are being done this past year.  It seems if you don't have a Blue Ray player you're not going to get all the bells and whistles companies used to release on their DVDs.  I remember not too long ago when multiple disc DVDs were jam packed with special features.  All of a sudden the special features seem to be for Blue Ray owners only.  Not only that but they are pushing Blue Ray + DVD releases.  I've looked in the stores and only find the 2 disc Blue Ray + DVD copy of this movie and I hear the special features aren't even on that.  The 1 disc DVD only edition comes out a month later.  You need to buy the 5 disc edition that also has a disc for Blue Ray 3D to get the extra Blue Ray special features disc further denying the DVD only group.  It feels like DVDs are going the way of VHS tapes.",1319500800,4,1045,3.90521327014218
4303847,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"If you're a fan of Johnny Depp's zany character and enjoy the more adventurous family movies, you won't be bored with this one. We saw it in the movie theater when it came out and my 10-year-old was enthralled the entire time. I'd give this movie 3 out of 5 stars if I were rating the movie on its own merits.

However, I'm deducting a star for this release itself on principle. I own a Blu-Ray player and a DVD player, but the studio's attempt to force people to purchase Blu-Ray or wait another month for the DVD is brazenly obnoxious. I'll wait a few weeks and save $10, thank you - I like having a choice. If, that is, that I'm not so steamed by then that I choose not to buy the movie at all.",1319414400,,697,4.087591240875913

BUT I will admit that would have been a  HUGE mistake, and I totally agree with previous reviews and say Orlando and Keira, who??? You will not even notice their absence. It's a well done movie and far exceeds the previous 3rd installment.",1319414400,,464,4.0989010989010985
4303849,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Let's get the obvious thing out of the way first.  None of the sequels will ever be able to hold a candle to the first one.  It's hard to say where I'd rate this compared to 2-3 because I've only viewed it twice, and it might end up being a movie that is stronger with more viewings.  Part 3 to me is a bit weaker with subsequent viewings because I can't stand the lame, uninspired ""me too"" speech Elizabeth gives.  Not every damn movie has to have a speech before battle, and if it is lame it makes it all the worse.  And I can't help but feel there was so much potential for the final battle, ruined by the fact that there were 100s of ships and only 2 get stuck in some maelstrom in the worst waste of potential I have ever seen.

Anyway let's get to some strong points about this movie

-Filmed in 3D, 3D is strong and has incredible depth, a high quality 3D experience
-Depp and Rush are great in this film.
-Astrid Bergs-Frisbey is a cutie and the sweet yet small love story was so cute.
-seemed slow at first but after about half way it actually started to feel like a good ol Pirate movie again.
-Pretty satisfying ending

Low points
-Penlope Cruz is not attractive, can't play any character other than a Brazilian since she can't act past her own natural accent.
-Ian McShane's character isn't all that interesting, sure he's ok.  But it's hard to top such magical characters as Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa.  I found Astrid Bergs-Frisbey's Serena a more interesting character, and would have preffered more of that story arc.  Too bad they focused on the wrong characters I think.
-Rageti and Pintel were such a funny duo, they are sorely missed here.

Overall the positives outweigh the negatives.  And if you have a 3D set up, it's deffinatly an enjoyable movie with high quality 3D for you to check out.  I would probably put this as my #2 favorite just behind the 1st film in the series.",1319414400,7,1906,4.3931623931623935
4303850,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"I'm not going to pass this off as Best Picture, but I dragged into this fearing the worst.

Stranger Tides turned out to be alright.  There is a somewhat coherent storyline and the annoying Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are long gone.  I think when you're in the mood for something dumb but sorta fun, this is the type of movie you want to see.  The Blu-Ray looks great, sounds even better.  The image is a tad soft (shot on digital) compared to the first Pirates - which was tack sharp, but nothing to be ashamed of.

Look, if the last two movies in the series never would have been made and this would have been the real Pirates sequel, it would be much higher rated.  It really is a huge improvement on Dead Man's Chest and World's End.  Those movies were genuinely awful.  This is harmless fun.",1319328000,,801,4.358108108108108

4303854,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Part Four of the Disney money soup and the concept keeps riding high. Not a whole lot of story here, this version is more just allowing a group of terrific actors to strut their stuff in hilarious semi-drag and play it for what it was meant to be - Disney entertainment.  Johnny Depp continues to be the raison d'etre for the project and he is in fine form with antics that include a lot of sword play and harrowing escapes, and yet all the while maintaining that inimitable twinkle of the eye that makes these films fly.

Some new folk are around - Penlope Cruz is lovely and lush but without a whole lot to do in this search for Ponce de Leon's site of the Fountain of Youth.  Ian McShane is the peg-legged Blackbeard, Geofffrey Rush hams it up as Barbossa,  and Richard Griffiths has a terrific time as the blubbery old fop King George - a role that deserves some awards for best supporting actor.  The show is mighty and loud - Hans Zimmer's musical score drowns out most of the dialogue, but then that is no great problem as the dialogue is secondary to the action.  In all this is a rather long in the tooth production, but with the likes of Johnny Depp having the obvious raging good time it is entertaining.

4303856,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"This movie (and, to a lesser degree, the whole franchise), is truly a letdown from almost every angle. Being an armchair maritime archeologist makes these movies especially painful. Why? Simply because the real stories of the pirates (especially Henry Morgan and Blackbeard/aka. Edward Teach) are far more interesting than these fake, made up Hollywood plots can and could ever hope to be. The plot is tedious, confusing and dull in this installment. The props look like they where taken from the shelves of Home Depot and ""weathered"" to look old. The actors teeth,hair, skin are clean as a whistle. Their style of talking sounds like they are fresh from  the 21st century. I could go on and on. Since when do these directors feel the need to abandon the important events of History and make a mockery out of the period and subject? It was a brutal, hard life back then, but these films portray people as happy-go lucky and carefree to the point of making the viewer (ironically)sick to their stomachs. After publisher's found Michael Crichton's novel ""Pirate Latitudes"" on his computer, i became very worried that the whole Pirate theme would be taken as a joke, and the only thing serious about the genre was making money. With this movie, my worst fears have been realized. When will we ever get a solid film like Heston's ""Treasure Island"" adaptation? I dream of the day a serious movie comes along about the Sunken city of Port Royal in it's Glory days, with Henry Morgan and others at the heart of the film.",1319241600,,1513,4.752851711026616

It is outstanding and completely satisfying on many levels. It includes the 3D and the 2D Blu-ray versions, a special features Blu-ray disc, a DVD version and a digital copy version. There's enough in this package to satisfy almost anyone who has an interest in the franchise.

The 3D effects are rather modest but provide an interesting alternative for those who have taken the step into 3D. The picture and the sound are both first class; the movie features dts HD Master Audio 7.1 and the surround speakers are given a serious workout as is the subwoofer. There is an interesting surprise awaiting those who decided to watch all the way to the end of the credits; don't miss out on this one.

Another very gratifying plus is the use of dts HD Master Audio 5.1 on the Bonus Disc; not only is the picture 1080P but it features an aggressive sound package which gives all of the speakers a good workout. The bonus features are interesting and well done; they're fun to watch.

4303898,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"He's baaaaaaaack!  The first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movie introduced Johnny Depp to a much, much wider audience; as Captain Jack Sparrow, he was a wonder, cracking wise and kicking butt (often at the same time).  CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL remains a family-friendly action/adventure classic.  It's sequels...eh.

ON STRANGER TIDES makes no sense.  Okay?  Should this surprise you...you're in the wrong genre, my friend.  It's big and bold (though not nearly as much as its two predecessors, thank God), features some mediocre acting (Depp and Geoffrey Rush remain strong, and Ian McShane is fantastic even though his character is crudely drawn), a few genuine laughs, a few false laughs, a few failed bits of choreography, and a whole lot of fun.  Maybe not as much fun as back at the beginning, when all of this was new, but you'll still enjoy yourself...probably.

The plot?  Something to do with Blackbeard (McShane), his daughter (Penelope Cruz; finally, a strong female character, or at least a strong female actress); Captain Barbosa (Rush) as a British emissary; a shirtless priest who falls in love with a mermaid (you think I'm joking, but I'm not); the fountain of youth; and a bunch of good pirates and evil British guys.  Oh, and Keith Richards.  Rock on.

If I sound sarcastic, it's because you just can't take this movie seriously, not even on its own terms.  But trust me: ON STRANGER TIDES is, at the very least, a fun movie (note the three stars).  Jack Sparrow is getting rather tired (I would much rather watch the first film on repeat), but Depp still has enough charisma to breathe a little bit more life into him.  If nothing else, the visuals remain spectacular, the plot interesting enough for us to forgive the fact that it is so full of holes an elephant could waltz right through it, and the pirates still delightfully funny (I'd love to see the ""realistic"" version of this film...well, maybe not).  It could stand to be a little darker and scarier (the mermaid premise, as awful as it originally comes across, actually had some promise), but we're willing to settle for what it is.

4303931,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides follows the same formula as the first three movies, monsters, treasure and swashbuckling, but it do not manage to live up to the awesomeness of the first trilogy. The story this time around is that the Spanish, the English and Captain Blackbeard all want the fountain of youth so three ships set sail. Jack Sparrow get involved with this and the race in on, who will get to the fountain first. Now this is not a bad movie, it is entertaining but the plot lack the twists and turns that made the first three movies so fun.

This movie suffer from the beating a dead horse for money syndrome. The first trilogy rounds of and ends the story nicely, however as a result of that both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner was taken out of the picture, now I am glad those that made this film did not decide to ruin that ending and bring those two back, however them missing from the character list give Jack Sparrow very few balancing points and also drives the number of sub plots and plot twists down to almost nothing. Yes they do bring in some new characters but the chemistry just is not there. The fact of the matter is, this movie never needed to be made, the original trilogy have one, contained storyline, that ends. This movie is just made so Disney can milk a few more bucks out of their franchise.

Now as for the humor, a big part of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are the humor, and yes this movie to was funny, but while I in the first trilogy would laugh so hard my eyes would water up, this one was humerus at times but they tried to hard, with over acting and very contrived situations, many of which just where not funny, several times I could not suspend my disbelief because the acting was just bad, not the entire movie mind you bit in some of the scenes, it was like if Disney just said, ah people will buy this film anyway, it is a best selling franchise let us just not give a *beep* about if a scene turns out bad, let us just churn it out anyway, the movie is sloppy.

Now I am not saying that Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides is a bad movie, it have many good scenes, the action is entraining, the story is good and the special effects is often very well done, especially during the mermaid battle. (it is like Disney got tired of hearing how sweet and innocent their mermaids are, for these will rip your face of an enjoy it.) If you like the first three movies in the series I am sure you will enjoy this, it is not bad, it is just that when watching the first three movies I looked down when it was over and saw my popcorn untouched in my hand, the movies had sucked me into it's story making me forget everything else from the first scene until the credits rolled, this movie is merely ok. It is a ok fantasy movie but it is sub par to the rest of the series and it also feels very tacked on.

I recommend this movie to fantasy, swashbuckling and action fans, but if you expect it to be of the same caliber as the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, then prepare to be disappointed. If you just want two hours of entertainment of the fantastical sort then this movie will provide that and do so fairly well.",1317686400,2,3194,4.257001647446458

4303933,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"I'll admit--POTC 3 left me with quite the bitter taste in my mouth as I excited the theater. Days later, critics were screaming for the saga to end as a trilogy, and at the time, I was inclined to hop on this bandwagon. But then I stopped, and realized that redemption was needed for Pirates. I'm not sure if ""On Stranger Tides"" has accomplished this, but it's a start. No Keira Knightley; no Orlando Bloom? So freaking what?! Penelope Cruz was a nice addition. Ian McShane did a great job as Blackbeard. Geoffrey Rush needed more screen time as Hector Barbossa, and the Spanish were shamefully skimmed over. The mermaids were annoying, though. Particularly Serena.

Hopefully ""Pirates 5"" will be a vast improvement. HOPEFULLY.",1317513600,,727,4.862903225806452

Is it a way to make people who have no 3D buy the movie in 3D?  Or just buy the package with the 3D?  I didn't see the movie in 3D in the theater.  Unless it is a special movie I find 3D distracting and painful.  Seems just another way to eek more bucks out of people who like extras.  Liked the chart though.

This movie was fantastic contrary to what the critics said. What is wrong with them??? Maybe they didn't see the same movie?? All the actors were fantastic, the storyline was great and fresh and the humor was at times rib splitting for me. The bed scene with Barbossa, Jack and the skeleton of Ponce de Leon is hysterical. Penelope Cruz did a great job as a pirate both going up against and laying down with our Jack Sparrow!! Lucky girl!! The story was new and different------but still had the same magic of the pirates and some of the old familiar faces and fall backs to the other movies and of course Jack's humor and tricks but added new faces and different locations. I loved it and highly recommend it! Can't wait till #5 comes out!",1317168000,12,859,4.341614906832298
4303936,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Ok so, before I begin, I have to say that I am a HUGE fan of all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. I consider myself a Pirates of the Caribbean nerd because I know so much about the movies, the characters, the books, and just pirates in general (History major). With that said, my experience with the movie wasn't as exciting as watching the others.

When the film opens, we see Mr. Gibbs, in a courtroom in London, who is about to be hanged for being a pirate. As you think how is he going to get out of this, who comes to his ""rescue""? The famous Jack Sparrow. He posed as the judge and eventually set him free. Now that is typical Jack, that is what I liked to see, so when the movie started, I thought this wouldn't be that bad. It got worse.

Captain Barbossa, who I have to say is my FAVORITE pirate of them all because he is the only one who actually resembles a true pirate. He wasn't to comically driven, he was your true, blue pirate, since he was based off of a real pirate Barbosa. Except in this movie, he's working for the king???? He's a privater?? That made me depressed. Eventually we find out why he's working for them, but I won't spoil the details. I just didn't like seeing him working for the king anyway.

To me, all the characters started off high, excluding my favorite Barbosa. Penelope Cruz, started off very well. I was never a huge fan of her, but I actually thought she was doing pretty well. I forget the guy's name who plays Blackbeard, but his opening scene was great. He gave off the presence of a true pirate villain. He seemed to portray very well what the real Blackbeard was like. Except, as greatly as these characters started, they all started to go downhill.

Each character started to lose their shine as the movie went on. They all started to be more lose and comedic rather than keep their pirate edge. I know some characters need to be funny because it's Pirates of the Caribbean! I would hate it if no one was funny, but I mean come on, EVERY character was trying to be funny. I don't remember Davy Jones being hilarious, or even Cutler Beckett being a laugh out loud character. Those were the types of characters that balanced out the original pirate movies. In this one, pretty much every character, except Blackbeard, was trying to be funny. I wasn't laughing. Except at Jack, he was still funny.

There were other side characters, but there wasn't much to them. There wasn't even much to the movie. I thought this movie was just, action, action, action, insert joke here, action, action, action, insert joke here. That was pretty much it. There was hardly any character development and the movie went really fast. The idea of the mermaids was interesting, but again, they went too fast and they only had about 5min of them actually doing something.

The ending was somewhat promising for the later two versions, if there will be later ones since Johnny Depp is starting to get ""iffy"" about them, but I won't ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Except you have to bare your way through a ton of pointless action scenes and your every now and then joke from a pirate or two until you get to the ending.

I did like the idea of the movie. How they were searching for the fountain of youth. That was a good idea. I felt the movie could have done a lot better if they done this idea in two movies instead of one. Like they did with Davy Jones. I felt that this adventure was too big for just one movie, but they decided to cram it all into one fast movie.

I LOVE the POC movies, I really do. I own the first three on Blu Ray and I was NOT disappointed with those at all! I know this movie, On Stranger Tides, was supposed to be a ""reboot"" of the series, but I don't think it started off that way. The movies didn't need a ""reboot"" they just needed a new adventure, but when most of the cast turned down their roles, they were stuck with 3 returning pirates and you can't really continue a series with just them. As much as I love Jack, Barbossa, and Mr. Gibbs, the movie wasn't the same without Will, Elizabeth and the entire pirate crew. It jut felt weird to me, but that's my opinion.

I've been a huge fan of POC since it first came out in theaters and I'll always be a big fan. Even if they come out with 2 more of these dull movies, I'll still go watch it because I love seeing Jack Sparrow do his thing. If you're a true POC fan, then I suggest you get this movie. If you aren't a dedicated fan then I suggest you just rent it again or watch it on Amazon. I'm probably going to buy it, but not for a while. I'll just enjoy the first three for a little longer until I introduce myself to the fourth one again. Like I said, it was action, action, insert joke here, action, action. Still, deep down, if they make two more, I still have a small bit of hope, that the other two will be a lot better than this one.",1316563200,,4866,4.2518918918918915
4303957,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"I guess at this point I shouldn't expect good movies out of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, but each time I watch one I'm let down. Overpacked with action and violence and then sorely lacking transition and resolution. I liked it until about 15 minutes from the end and it went downhill from there. Like usual the door was left open for the next in the series instead of just ending it once and for all. We never got to see what became of the clergyman and mermaid, the Black Pearl, or even Angelica. For this reason I thought the ending really fell flat, but like I said what should I expect from a Disney movie that's looking to make the most amount of money possible with the Pirates franchise.",1316044800,,702,4.366412213740458

4303959,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Ever since the emergence of Davey Jones in the series, I have been wondering whether the infamous Black Bear would be making an appearance in any of the series! I WAS RIGHT!

One of my other thoughts was how could they show the Kraken without showing mermaids? Guess what? I WAS RIGHT AGAIN!

I really believe that this movie takes nothing away from the series and is a very riveting continuation of the saga... in no way falling short to the rest of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The movie was as interesting to follow from start to finish... some points were slightly obvious, but not everything can be a mystery... you need to be guided along with the plot.

Jack Sparrow continues to be the same quirky and eccentric hero (if he can be called that) that he has always been the past movies. Penelope Cruze was a good addition and she played the role well... she is rather fitting in her role, even when her character shifts gears dramatically she is able to convincingly play the two. I have no issue with a number of the old characters not showing up in this sequel as I think they have done their part and have been played out. Then there is Black Beard... Even though the actor had the face, the voice, and overall intimidating demeanour about him, I couldn't get over the fact that he was on the tubby side and HAD NO NECK!!! That was very irritating to me for some reason, not sure why.

Now I have to say this because I couldn't help myself from blurting it out in during the movie and being shushed as a result... The scene where Jack ties a coconut to a rope and he rocks the palm tree and also where he swings from the palm tree using a rope to ties some villains up while he swings... WAS RIPPED OFF FROM A VERY OLD CARTOON I SAW AS A KID ABOUT THE ADVENTURES OF SINBAD AND ALI BABA!! IT HAD THE EXACT SAME MOVE IN THE EXACT SAME ORDER!!! RIPOFF!!! But, it was funny to see!

Overall a movie that lives up to being an sequel in the Pirates of the Caribbean saga.

4303962,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I'm a HUGE fan of the Pirate series of movies...can tell you the next line before they say it kind of fan.  (yeah I know...get a life :P)

First time I saw this movie I was disappointed. (Over the top expectations?)  Seemed to me the returning characters were more like secondary characters.  Not enough Jack/Barbossa or Gibbs.  I also missed Will/Elizabeth.

Found myself on a rainy day with nothing to do so took my daughter to see it again.  Second time around I enjoyed it much more!  It is different than the first 3 but not so much in a bad way.  I think that was my disappointment the first time I saw it.  Was expecting (hoping?) for the same type of movie as the first 3.  After I got over that part I was able to enjoy this movie for what is is.  An entertaining movie that does follow (to a point) the other 3 but just hmmmm different?  I also found that while not as much as the first 3 the other characters were a big part of the movie (well...maybe not Gibbs so much?)

That said I do with they had filled in a few more blanks between 3 and 4.  They did a little but not enough that really told what everyone was doing since 3.  Also not one mention of Will/Elizabeth.  Those 2 things would have really helped bring the stories together.

There are some inside jokes that if you haven't seen the first 3 you won't get.  That said it is also a movie that could stand on it's own although not recommended! Watch the others in order before this one.

Hoping when it comes to 5 (and from what I hear there will be a 5) they try to add a little more of 1,2 and 3 in with 4 to make another 5 start rated movie!

Recommended.",1314748800,,1632,4.117460317460317
4303963,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"To be honest, the movie bored me.  Sure, there is ""action"" in nearly every other scene, but it's all incredibly predictable from beginning to end.  On top of that, Johnny Depp's mannerisms as Capt. Jack Sparrow have grown old, and Penelope Cruz is not a suitable replacement for Keira Knightley.  Not by a long shot.  Aside from Cruz, the usually cast is there: Geoffrey Rush as Barbarossa, Ian McShane as Blackbeard, the monkey as the monkey.

Did I mention this film is roughly 43 hours long?  Well, maybe not that long, but that's how long it feels.  Honestly, how many sword fights, ridiculously complex escape plans, and identical score accompaniment can there be?  It's a revolving door of POTC, with only minor additions - some of which are subtraction by addition.  For instance, there is a mannequin missionary portrayed with concrete-settling zeal by Sam Claflin, and let's not forget Oscar Jaenada as ""The Spaniard,"" a character so stiff it made Barbarossa's wooden run (hop) a mile.

The plot revolves around Sparrow and an imposter Sparrow, who is rounding up a crew, meeting up and butting heads while mutually racing, along with the Spaniards, for the legendary Fountain of Youth.  The aforementioned paths' also cross with a British ship captained by a semi-reformed Barbarossa, and Queen Anne's Revenge, captained by Blackbeard and Sparrow's former lover Angelica - who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter.

Long title, long film.  Nothing terribly new for the series, and only fans will like it a lot.  Fans of the purely aesthetic will appreciate the filming.  Some very majestic scenes on open water.  Fans of the series will probably love it.  Pirate fans will hang the movie posters in their spare rooms.  If you're not in those groups, however, it will feel recycled no matter how much misdirection and subplot is involved.

4303964,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"Here is a rule of thumb. Each Pirate movie is exponentially worse than the one previous. The first being a classic, the second being highly entertaining, but not quite as special as the first. The 3rd was a bloated mess. The 4th was worse yet with a pointless plot and phoned in performances by most of the acting core. I fear for the 5th, and based on my infallible observations, it will be less than garbage.

In my opinion, this movie is just about on par with the previous films, so if you liked the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, you will surely enjoy this one as well.",1313712000,,567,4.4423076923076925
4303967,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Captain Jack Sparrow, The Gayest Pirate of all the Seven Seas (Next to Captain Morgan) returns!!! Part four of the Pirates franchise spends a little too long idling in the doldrums but excursions into fresh waters keep this latest installment afloat. Watch out though, that hull is springing leaks and it's unlikely she'll last any further voyages. Much like a trans-Atlantic crossing, you'd better be sure you're up to the lengthy challenge before ye board this wooden vessel.

The good: part four has lost the incessant pouting of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom; there's an awesomely spooky sequence where some nasty mermaids move in for the kill; there's Blackbeard's fearsome black magic; there's some very nifty action, lavish production design (director Rob Marshall has a background in musical theatre) and the effects are all top notch. And Geoffrey Rush has a peg leg.

The not so good: 130 minutes is too long for a pirate movie; Ian McShane is surprisingly underpowered as the villain; Johnny Depp's Captain Jack is just along for the ride without much to do; the film lacks both the narrative drive and freshness of the first.

Benefiting from the decision to begin anew after the existing trilogy is a good idea. This is a darker, more soulful entry with some fun set pieces. But it's definitely wearying and no amount of candle-lit exposition can make a slight plot interesting. Time to lay anchor for good?",1313625600,2,1424,4.949790794979079

I myself, maybe I might be overrating it, but I loved this movie. I thought it was much closer to the fun and surprise of the first movie, and not the bad dialogue and pacing issues of the second and third. Depp was great as usual, the new villain was awesome, and the movie was so much fun! It wasn't flawless, but it was really good.

Now as for this package, I would be more than happy to buy it. However, Disney really did a good job of ripping off the buyers who don't have a 3D TV.

This is not the only edition of the movie on Blu-Ray, but this is the best one to buy. The five disc set consists of The 3D Blu Ray disc of the movie, a standard Blu Ray edition, a special features disc on a REGULAR blu-ray, a DVD copy, and a Digital Copy of the film. So what's the problem? Well me myself, I do not own a 3D player, but I love special features on Blu-Ray discs and for DVD's, so I like to buy the edition where I can have all of my special features.

However, what Disney did with this release is they put the standard Blu-Ray disc with all of the special features ONLY IN THIS RELEASE! In the other Blu Ray release of this film, it only includes the movie on Blu-Ray and the Movie on DVD. No special Features Disc to be found, but it is in this version.

This is really scummy by Disney because not only do standard people who don't want a copy of it in 3D get ripped off of special features, but also us who like our features will have to dig out some more money to pay for it. This edition is about 5-10 dollars more expensive than the standard Blu Ray and not only because of the extra disc, but because of the 3D!

It really makes me annoyed because I love special features, and I thought this movie was really good! But I am going to have a tough decision to make whether to buy this edition or not. I don't know, what do you guys think? Me myself? I might not even end up buying the movie because of this. Darn shame, I was looking forward to getting it.",1313452800,91,2108,4.0095238095238095

And speaking of feminine touch. I will NEVER look at a mermaid quite the same way again. Shudder. Who knew?

Unfortunately, this movie was barely entertaining.  For one thing, why Disney chose to put Penelope Cruz in anything even remotely kid-friendly is beyond me.  She has been in several soft-core porn movies and is only a half-baked actress to boot.  Practically the entire movie was filmed on either an island or in England, and desperately lacked good ""piratey"" action.  There were only a few original cast members in this movie, and Elizabeth and Will were sorely missed.

This is by far the worst of the series and (I can't believe I'm saying this)I doubt I will even purchase it.",1313193600,4,728,4.4772727272727275

So if that is disagreeable to your mindset you are welcome to go ahead, scroll down and vote my review down. But if not, please read the rest of this and save yourself from watching a mangled, rotten fail of a movie.
First off. Director's changed. I hated that. I love Gore Verbenski. This is the only Rob Marshall film I've seen and will probably continue to be the only one because I despise what he did to my favorite film series. His action cuts were sloppy and completely lacked the vitality and fun-loving style Verbenski perfected, and his 'talking' shots made the cardboard dialogue even worse than it already was.
And the cast has completly changed for the worst. Depp is dull and lacks his roguish mystery and charm, burdened down from sustaining the entire film. Barbossa isn't the same and neither is Gibbs. Rush and McNally are in this for the money. Cruz was alright, I suppose, but McShane whom I had high hopes for was so boring and utterly unthreatening I wanted to laugh whenever he gave death threats. The missionary and the mermaid are atrocious. I don't even care to know their names. Will and Elizabeth had a much richer and more interesting relationship. The Spaniards I was very, very interested in at first and would have loved to hear more from, had they had a total screentime of more than five minutes.
The plot is so straightforward it makes you feel like you're being talked down to like a child. This is what happens when small minded people cannot follow a story well enough to understand what was going on in At World's End and the writers decide to talk to them on a level they (and any resident kindergartners) can understand. When it's not hitting you over the head by its baseness, there are plot holes big enough to sail the Black Pearl through, if the Black Pearl were even in this movie. She isn't. (That right there would have taken off a star all by itself.)
There are no sea battles. The story is supposed to take place in Florida and they filmed it in Hawaii, which equals mountains and black sand beaches. None of those in Florida, people! Ugh. There's more stupidity but the memories are making me nauseous.
The pros? A few, not enough to matter. Hans Zimmer is still awesome. The first twenty minutes are actually worthy and raise your hopes far too high. There's poorly choreographed swordfights for the folks who just come to see action.

Sparrow isn't alone on that journey though, because Black Beard (Ian McShane) and Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) are also looking for the fountain. Jack finds himself, a prisoner of Black Beard and the former love of his life Angelica Malon (Penelope Cruz), who just might be Black Beard's long lost daughter.
  Depp has already signed on for more sequels, that's how much he loves playing Jack Sparrow, but before he puts on the eye liner again, he needs a script that's worthy to him and the character. The last 2 sequels would have been better if they were a lot shorter and if the stories weren't so confusing with too many double crosses.
  On Stranger Tides has a story you can wrap your brain around and makes a good adventure/fantasy due to having zombies and dangerous mermaids and etc, but Jack Sparrow is too heroic this time around, which is pretty out of character. Despite being the main star, Sparrow also feels as if he's just on the outside looking in through a lot of the film as well. While Ian McShane, is well cast as Black Beard but is the weakest villain of the films due to being pretty under-used and not as threatening as Davy Jones or Barbosa.
  While the film would have felt more alive and memorable if the original director, Gore Verbinski came back. Rob Mashall tried hard with this film, but Verbinksi's films were at least great to look at with well shot sword fights and ship battles. After the first film blew me away, I never felt as if any of the sequels lived up to their potential though and On Stranger Tides is no exception.

4303999,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I am 40 years old. I was in my early 30's when Pirates 1 came out. I loved every moment. I've seen it 30 times, easily. While people are different, obviously, I don't understand how someone doesn't just love that movie. Original, fun, funny, well-acted, great effects, great plot, great twists and turns...just...great.

P2 had me worried early. The scenes on the island with the cannibals...the first time I saw it...I remember not really being into it. But that ends quickly. On further viewings, it doesn't bother me as much...but mostly because the rest of the movie, I think, is even better than the first. It is the Empire Strikes Back of the series. It leaves us in a dark place. Everything comes to a head perfectly...and then...just leaves us. And that ending...takes us right back to the Disneyland ride. It's a great movie. If I rank these movies on a 1 to 10 scale, the first is a 10. The second is a 10.5. The third, however, is an 8.

I had concerns about how they were going to go about the start of the third with the Depp's cliffhanger in the second, and those concerns were validated. I just didn't like it. The opening action sequence was great, probably the best start of all of the films, but it quickly goes downhill in Davy Jones' locker with the crabs and more. It doesn't really make sense, it doesn't flow, it takes too long. The second half of the movie has too much back and forth talking, but not in a good way. It does come together at the end, but it's too late. Tried too hard to bring the series to a close. I give it an 8 overall, despite a strong start and end. 90 minutes in the middle that did a lot wrong.

So, we come to On Stranger Tides, the fourth movie in the series, and one that doesn't suffer from having to pick up the pieces of the last movie (half of the cast is gone). Like the second movie, it starts badly. The stuff in England is not great. The chase scene ends...well, no spoilers, but what a great coincidence. And the trap door...a coincidence. And on and on. It just seems like the first 20-30 minutes of the movie, while reacquainting us with Sparrow and establishing some bit of story, just fits too tidy due to great reaches. Also, the OTHER movies were about Will Turner and Sparrow was the middleman. Here, he is the lead, and that's a different movie. He isn't supposed to be the hero. He's supposed to be the accidental hero, the guy that mostly likes to do right, and does it half of the time by accident and half of the time because he gets forced to. Here, he's the good guy. It's a change. But, again with the slow start, I have to say that the back 2/3rds of the movie was great this time, better than the third movie. Some of the ending was a surprise and seemed weird, but overall, this movie started weak like number two and got better sooner, just didn't have the better ending of number three and certainly not the overall sense of 1 or 2. I give it a 9, but that seems to be way better than the critics. I have only seen it once (versus 30 times for the first, ten for the second, twice for the third), but I will watch it again here on Blu-ray and think it will be better.

An average Pirates movie with Depp is still better than most movies that come out. Ignore the critics, watch the flick.",1310601600,3,3269,4.293354943273906

4304002,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"[This review is the theatrical release.]

With a mix of historical fact, some mythology and lots of suspension of disbelief, I enjoyed watching Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides.

Themes & Plot:

I like how the movie starts out with an imposter Jack Sparrow, rumors of putting a crew together and various secret plans and maps to find Ponce de Leon's fountain of youth.  The problem with the fountain is that you steal another's life and gain their years.  It's not a simple matter of taking a drink.

Interesting myth-making here.  The tear from a mermaid, two silver goblets and a victim.  Piece of cake!

The character driven story was much more involved than the special effects CGI-fest of the past films.  I was a bit surprised at the rocky Florida coast and lighthouse castle (rocky coasts in Florida??) and enjoyed the pirates Blackbeard and the one-legged pirate played by Ian McShane.  Penelope Cruz as the sexy pirate was also fun to watch - but really, I doubt women at the time were ever permitted onboard these vessels as officers, much less there at all!

The life aboard ship was antiseptic as is expected from a Disney film.  The ""zombie-fied"" slavers whipping the boys into shape, the sexy but deadly mermaids and the various subplots, such as the romance between mermaid and minister - made for a well-paced film.

There are a few slow points and that's why a four rather than a five star film.  The acting was well-done, the special effects were good without being overdone, and the discoveries of various creatures and activities was interesting as well as the supernatural.

The Spanish explorers were into destroying what they considered pagan or supernatural, which is in conformance with their historical voyages of destruction of the native peoples' cultures in this area.

Bottom Line:  More character driven than the others; recaptured for me the pacing and the art of telling a story that the first film had.  Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz make a great couple.  And the in-credits scene opens the door for yet another sequel!

You quickly realize that this is the true sequel to the first film, whereas the other pirates were more of a 1.5, and 1.75, and those films were more of a way to finish the Elizabeth/Will timeline.

Penelope Cruz makes a great addition to the pirates cast, and she is fiesty and she brings attitude to the series, and I believe that she's a great partner for Jack.  Also new to the series are mermaids, and Blackbeard, the latter proves to be one of the more vicious villians of the series, and the former makes a great plot-point.

4304006,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"Before I start let me say this: First, I loved the Pirates films, loved them.  My wife and I were waiting so long for this fourth movie to come out, to see Capt. Jack strike out on his own.  Second, I think that Ian McShane is one of the best actors our time and so is Johnny Depp.

Now that I have said that....

I had to wait at least this long to post a review because I didn't even want to think about this movie again.  The good news?  The film is so terrible and forgettable that it would make an awesome Mystery Science Theater 3000 flick.  Fountain of Youth?  Sounds great!  It is as though they didn't think beyond a simple story board.  Get a villain whose name would sound familiar to anyone that ever saw a History Channel program about ""The Real Pirates Of The Caribbean"".  Then you get a few familiar faces from the franchise's past (except some of the best ones).  You throw in more mannerisms for Capt. Jack, and don't forget a few one-liners.  Add love interest, supernatural powers for the villain, a new spooky ship, and then have a few characters in the background that you would have found more interesting if only the writers had given them more attention (the missionary and the mermaid story).  Honestly?  I would have been happy to watch and entire movie about the mermaid and the holy man!

They killed Capt. Jack in the same way that they killed Indiana Jones.  My wife is a Pirates fanatic and she was crestfallen and completely disappointed.  There were so many points in the movie where I looked around the theater at people's expressions feeling like the only sane person in a crazy world, but others were just as confused about why the movie was so awful as I was.  I love the character of Capt. Jack and he was robbed of his dignity and his place on my DVD shelf.

All of this happened before, all this will happen again.  Hollywood will make more bad movie sequels so long as they believe that they can make a buck.

4304017,1,B004A8ZWUQ,"This is one of those franchises that most parents must tolerate:  it is character-based, the story barely matters, and you either get it or you don't.  To be honest, I never have quite gotten it.  I like the actors very much, esp. Depp, but also the original cast of Rush, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly, etc.  However, I find the plot, the entire concept, extremely lame, kind of an excuse for endless action sequences  that are simply tiring after a while.  The visual effects didn't carry it for me either.

OK, Depp has a map of the Fountain of Youth.  Add to the intrigue an old lover of his, the amazing Penelope Cruz as well as Blackbeard, played by the wonderful Ian McShane.  Again, these are first rate actors.  So what happens?  They find it, with all sorts of sword fights, and sirens added into the mix, including Spanish Catholic fanatics who want to end all this pagan business.  It is an absolutely incoherent mess.  Nothing is believable, even my son barely laughed while maintaining that he liked it, and it fails to advance whatever the base story line is.

I think this is a complete failure, merely trying to give more of the same to viewers who will pay.  I can't believe it is a Disney thing, which is unusually successful at adding magic to traditional stories or creating them.  Perhaps others that are better will follow, particularly with the ending and all the threads left hanging from the original trilogy.  But really, why bother?",1308528000,12,1464,4.65625
4304018,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"The saga is going on and will never stop. The pirates are eternal and Jack Sparrow's fame is eternal since he discovered the Fountain of Youth. It is not a master piece but it is very well done and highly entertaining.

We expect and we get all the battles, fights, struggles, duels or whatever with the pirates on one side, the English on the other side and the Spaniards on the third side. That coin is definitely magical with its three sides. The interest in these battles is the sites, the costumes and the details. The English king, the German George, the one who brought Handel to England, I guess, is a fat slob and I am amazed they still can find actors to play such roles. They must be highly handicapped in real life.

The treasure chase is original again and this time we have to go up more often than down and the fountain of youth is higher than its source. But this time there are no monsters, monkeys, spiders, hardly one snake, no crocodiles, no sharks or whatever. The only exotic beings are mermaids. They must have mobilized the whole Olympic swim team to take care of the flotilla of mermaids that attack the poor sailors. I must admit the love affair between the Catholic missionary and the mermaid is sentimental enough to be dramatic.

On another hand they always use some family connections which are both false and true, just like all the sworn promises are both truthful and fakes, and the promises are always respected and yet always turned around and broken, not directly, as if it were an accident. Here it is very useful to get rid of a couple of old pirates that will no longer be there next time and that will be a good thing. They deserve to retire or be marooned on some desert island.

So enjoy this long film the way it has to be enjoyed, like a beautiful piece of entertainment and a very well performed and acted piece of cinema.

(SPOILERS: Jack get a sword because a soldier who's giving him chase decides to leave it behind on a table?  We never see how Jack actually gets the chalices?)  And those little things did pull me out of the movie a bit.  But the biggest problem was the ""love story.""  Almost halfway through the film we're introduced to a young good-looking kid who's sole job is to preach the gospel and save souls.  Boring.  This is a pirate movie and the pirates are the heroes which means an uninteresting goody-goody bible-thumper suddenly showing up is not gonna cut it.  Now, if they'd set this up in the opening teaser where they show him out spreading the word and he gets attacked and beaten by pirates, then we're reintroduced to him halfway through...... I'm a little more on his side.  But then he falls in love with a mermaid who ALSO shows up halfway through?  I don't CARE about these characters!  They show up and swim away in the same fashion and we're left not caring.  It was like the script was ready and some Producer said ""We need a love story!  Here's what my kid wrote last night!  Shove that into the middle somewhere!""

That being said, TIDES was far more coherent, exciting and fun than the last two PIRATES outings.  Amazing production design, great cameos, a fun plot, and great performances by Depp, Rush, Cruz and McShane.  And they even managed to fit in a set piece with a PIRATES ride location!  I thought those had all been used up!  With some terrific story points left wide open for a fifth movie (almost guaranteed to start with a more-than-usually-disoriented Jack Sparrow having no control over his body), it's another solid entry into what looks to be a six-film series.

This was an awsome movie, like the others. Pirates 2, and 3 were so underrated. they were fun movies and people are gonna keep critisizing them just because they are more bizare, and weird.
  This movie is was like the others are supposed to be: Fun, action packed and some what scary. One part of the movie that made it so fun was Jacks escape scenes which are so much more entertaining and creative than in the others. The action was great as always. Althogh the action wasn't as creative as I would've hoped for, and it seemed like it was somewhat copied from the others but thats no big problem it was still cool. An dof course it woulddn't be the same if it wasn't for its scary scenes. I actually thought this was the most scary and violent and scary of the movies. There were many scenes that made me jump especialy, the scenes with the mermaids.
  Now the reason I give 4 stars is because it was as original and well done as the others and the were a few more plot holes then I would have wished for ( most of them revolves around the fountain of youth and it's powers).
  So otherwise though it has many flaws ""On Stranger Tides"" id an awsome installment to the series and if you are a fan of the series I would go see it. And don't foget to stay for the extra scene after the credits.",1308009600,5,1311,4.199203187250996

""On Stander Tides"" is about Captain Jack Sparrow trying to find the fountain of youth. He is competing against his old foe Captain Barbossa and the Spanish to find it.

With the new plot and characters, ""On Stranger Tides"" is better than ""At Worlds End"" but is nowhere near ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".

4304023,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"""ON STRANGER TIDES"" - One of the greatest historical fantasy book of all time, by Tim Powers, written twenty+ years back. Tim Powers specializes in books taking historical characters and historical events and giving them a weird spin, weaving into the fantasy and the occult elements. Blackbeard, voodoo, raising the dead, pirates doing Calculus, what was his name, Pawn Say, Kingston harbor falls into the sea, the search for the Fountain of Youth, etc.

By all means, READ the BOOK FIRST.

An OK movie by Disney/ Johnny Depp standards, the movie is very much watered down version of maybe 20% the book. Johnny Depp buckling swashes, fights, violence with little motivation. Summer fare.  Much of the explanation for what is going on (and why) is left out of the movie and only the action scenes are left in. If you liked the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies, this movie is very much the same and you won't be disappointed. But if you HAVE read the book, (and I loved the book), don't go to the theater expecting to see it.

Ian McShane (Deadwood) plays a convincing magician Blackbeard, with burning hemp in his beard. Keith Richards (of the Rolling Stones) makes a guest appearance, as, who else, Capt Jack Sparrow's father!  Why is Blackbeard doing voodoo?, why did Kingston (Jamaica) harbor sink into the sea?, why do pirates do calculus? who is Pawn Say? You'll have to read the book.",1307664000,3,1395,4.771784232365145
4304024,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"So imagine you're a mermaid, right? The top half of you is insanely hot. Your hair's got that sexy, just-came-out-of-the-shower thing going on, maybe the smallest strand of it is stuck to your face. The buoyancy of the water means that your bosom's always bouncing, and somehow your skin never gets pruny. The bottom half of you is kind of fishy, but you're still fully capable of holding intelligent conversation, of making rational choices, and, most importantly, of feeling human emotion. Look, I understand that you and I are different, but do you seriously have to devour us regular folk? I mean honestly. I don't eat other people, and do you know why? Because I like talking to them! Because I empathize with them. Because they're my friends. For god's sake, there's a crapload of reasons I don't eat people. And I don't see why mermaids should be any different.

Plus, when mermaids are out of the water, their somewhat-less-than-attractive fish tails magically go away and turn into alluring lady parts. On land, they're completely human! All I'm saying is instead of cannibalistically devouring us homo sapiens, they should just eat fish or something--I'm sure there's a way. I mean, one of the mermaids is even the center of the main love story. You can't have it both ways, Pirates of the Caribbean. Either they're horrible sea monsters who just use their charm to feed, or they're sexy, briny, love trout. The only way I can even begin to make sense of this, and the movie doesn't give us much to go on, mind you, is that the mermaids were the guardians of the fountain of youth, and the only reason they were killing people was because they knew these were bad men who would use the fountain for their own, evil ends.

Phew. So as you may or may not have gathered, this new installment of Pirates is about the quest for the fountain of youth, which so happens to be located on an island surrounded by lovely, fangy mermaids. Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), and the Spaniards (various) are all racing to be the first to unlock the power of the fountain, and these mermaids are hell bent on stopping them. The only person they don't attempt to kill is a missionary (Sam Claflin). The reason I spent so long ranting about this is not because I disliked the mermaids. Quite the contrary. The mermaid love story was, in my opinion, the most touching and interesting part of the film. The major players were acted expertly, mind you, but they just didn't have good story arcs. Ian McShane made a menacing Blackbeard, but his character was one note and weak. Geoffrey Rush is one of the best actors of our day, and he lent a great deal of formidability to Captain Barbossa, but his story is nothing compared to his quest to free himself from the Curse of the Black Pearl. And we've already seen so much of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Sure, he's great and all, but it's the random missionary and his mermaid lover (Astrid Berges-Frisbey) who manage to capture our imaginations.

Other than the love story, which feels almost tacked on, this movie is very simple, which is actually a good thing! After a great start to this series, the sequel and threequel were huge letdowns. Each became more mired in its sense of the grandiose. The plots became a tangled jumble of unrelated elements, each more confusing than the last. Impossibly hard to follow, these sequels left audiences with nothing but Johnny Depp's charm and a good deal of sword fighting. Here, though, the plot is straightforward. Three different groups are racing toward the same goal, and everything comes together nicely. Yet, for all their effort, the film lacks a certain something. The story structure is there, but there's just no magic to it. Because things are so clearly foreshadowed, there's no mystery, no surprise, and this makes it nigh impossible to become emotionally invested. I almost nodded off at the beginning, but by the end all I could say was, ""Well done, I guess. Things did sort of come together there, didn't they?""

At least most of the basic plot made sense, because if you start digging a little deeper, this movie is riddled with details that do not add up to two licks of a wench's tongue on Tuesday. In fantasy, you're allowed to invent some things, but On Stranger Tides goes too far. In the first film, for example, there's a curse that causes men to live forever, but their bodies wither away, turning to skeletons. That's the one example of magic that drives the whole story. Here, however, the writers throw in an endless barrage of unexplained mysteries. Why does Blackbeard's ship have giant flamethrowers? I don't think they had that kind of technology back then. And I'll grant Blackbeard a sword that lets him magically control his rigging, but how does that translate to his being able to capture real life ships in tiny bottles? For that matter, how is Blackbeard able to create zombie deckhands that can't be killed? And why doesn't he have more of them? And why is it never important to the story?

Things may not hold together completely, but there's still a lot to love. This is definitely the 2nd best Pirates movies and will provide a bit of fun for those who decide to go. Thanks to the expert acting, a reasonably well-plotted story, and some compelling missionary mermaid action, I give Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides:

Score: 3.5/5

Mermaids are just too hot for me to believe they're killing those poor guys. Hot girls can't possible have bad intentions, right? Maybe they're just dragging them underwater to the love kelp?

4304025,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"I saw On Strangers Tides with my son. He liked it a lot, I didn't. I found it confusing and a bit of a snooze. It was even more confusing because of the mumbling by actors when they were supposed to be explaining convoluted plot points. He found it satisfying and fun. He insisted on staying until the end of the credits to see the giveaway scene at the very end.

As for Blackbeard and his magic ship... Give me a break. The real Blackbeard was a sadistic monster who handed over one of his numerous brides to be gangraped by the crew. The movie Blackbeard isn't half as scary as the real one. In fact, he's not scary at all. The idea that he would actually be suckered by the attractive Penelope Cruz attempting to pass herself off as his daughter in order to have a real father and redeem his soul is laughable. This is what we mean when we talk about the 'Disneyfication of history.' If you're going to deviate from history, please make it entertaining. This isn't.

As for the rest of the story... Runaway carriages. Fires. Sword fights. Disguises. Cleavage. Explosions. Exotic locations. Pastries. Treasure maps. Tricks. Traps. Treasures. Mermaids -- who are either vampires or cannibals, it's not clear which. Pirates. Zombie pirates. Hey, you can't go wrong with zombie pirates, can you?

The real gem in the movie is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. He is the most believable character and I found myself wishing they had dumped Jack and crew and focussed on him. Barbossa has turned privateer and is now working for King George as a way to get financing so he can get revenge on Blackbeard who took the Black Pearl and cost him his leg. He's the realest, most convincing of the characters, and that while laboring under the handicaps of ugly makeup, a bad wig, and a pegleg. Rush should be given his own movie; he could carry it.

The special effects in the movie aren't all that special. The first time you see the Queen Anne's Revenge (Blackbeard's ship) come alive and grab sailors and hang them, it's a surprise, but after the third or fourth time, it's ho hum. The best scenes are the mermaids--lovely young women with bare breasts, artfully concealed to keep its PG-13 rating. They're well done. It's the whole, ""Now they grow fangs and are going to eat us"" part that strains credulity. Did we really need that?

The result? If you're expecting some substance that makes sense underneath all the derring do and hats with feathers, you'll find it a yawn. If you just want to be entertained by things blowing up, cleavage, and exotic scenery, it will be a fun romp.

4304026,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"The film starts out with ominous music. An old sailor is discovered who was once on a ship that was looking for the Fountain of Youth...200 years ago! This sets off a frenzy to look for the Fountain. You would think without Orlando and Keira, the movie would be a bust. What I missed more than those two stars were the minor actors who played the crew. They were colorful characters who we have come to know. Alas, except for a few, they're  gone. The action is the same: sword fights, impossible escapes, humorous dialouge, and unexpected turns. We get to meet Jack's father and Angelica Malon (Penlope Cruz) the later of which Jack supposedly deflowered right before she was getting ready to take her vowels in a Spanish convent. No surprise there.

Now in order to use the Fountain of Youth, there must be a ritual. We discover early on the ritual requires two silver chalices and a mermaid's tear. We also discover that the Black Pearl has been sunk and Hector is working for the crown. Through a series of events, Jack becomes Shanghaied on Black Beard's (Ian McShane) ship. We have 3 groups after the Fountain, the Spanish, the English who have Gibbs who has memorized the map, and Blackbeard. While Jack is in the hold, Angelica is Black Beard's first mate having convinced him she is his long lost daughter. As always in these movies everyone has their own ideas, desires, and shifting alliances.

The group must go on these quests to gather the items before going to the Fountain. (I see an RPG in the making.)

The silver chalices are not just any 2 silver chalices but the ones that belonged to Ponce De Leon.

The mermaids have the beauty and allure of a Siren, but when they attack they have super-human strength and vampire teeth, making their capture a bit tricky and deadly. I fell in love with the doll face of the first mermaid (Gemma Ward who actually plays a character called Dollface in ""The Strangers"".) I know this is a Disney movie and this should go without saying...The mermaids are indeed topless, but the camera angles, hair and arm placements prevent any kind of ""R"" view. There might be a parent or two concerned due to some of the photos that are out there.

One piece of dialouge:

Jack: ""You lied to me by telling me the truth?""

Angelica: ""Yes.""

Jack: ""That's very good. I'll have to use that.""

Good View on the big screen. Lacks the ornate special effects of the other 3 movies as well as many of the characters. It appears they did this on less of a budget in order to get a larger net return.  4 1/2 stars.",1307145600,,2545,4.4989154013015185
4304037,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Very often, the dollar signs in a studio executive's eyes prove to be too powerful a draw, leading them to offer huge sums of money to stars to reprise their roles. A director is found who can, at the least, maintain the status quo and not kill the lucrative franchise. And a sequel is born. But sequels are almost always a case of diminishing returns, both financially and creatively. Such is the case with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films I hoped the series was killed by the critically panned third installment, but it made a bounty of cash. And before you could say ""Davy Jones' Locker"", Johnny Depp was offered a huge sum of money (I heard rumors of $40 million), a new director was brought on board (Rob Marshall, director of ""Chicago"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and ""Nine"") and producer Jerry Bruckheimer was able to offer Disney an almost certain money maker for Summer, 2011. This should help make up for his recent duds ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" and ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"".

The good news? ""On Stranger Tides"" is better than ""At World's End"", but that isn't saying much. It's not worth paying extra dollars to see in 3-D. It is worth, at most, the cost of a bargain matinee.

Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) crosses paths with an old flame, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), who is posing as Jack to recruit a crew for a mysterious voyage. Jack is soon shanghaied and quickly learns Angelica is posing as Blackbeard's (Ian McShane) daughter in an effort to tag along as he searches for the fabled Fountain of Youth. Meanwhile, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has joined the Royal Navy and seems determined to use the new resources and power at his disposal to hunt down Blackbeard. Eventually, both groups will cross paths with a group of Spanish sailors who also seem to be looking for Ponce de Leon's treasure. Along the way, they try to collect pieces of the puzzle; legend dictates they will need the tear of a live mermaid and two of Ponce de Leon's silver chalices.

Directed by Rob Marshall and written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (among others), ""On Stranger Tides"" benefits from a few changes but suffers from some big narrative problems.

I'm not sure why the producers decided to leave Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley out of this adventure, but it was a good decision. Quite frankly, each looked both bored and angry at the same time throughout ""At World's End"". I really doubt they turned this installment down - if they were considered valuable enough, huge sums of money would have appeared to help entice them. It certainly worked with Depp. I have never been a fan of Bloom, but I do enjoy Knightley's work. That said, ""Stranger Tides"" seems to have more energy due to their absence. The filmmaker's still deemed it necessary to have a younger couple along for the ride so they have created a new couple, a young priest who falls in love with the mermaid they have captured. Their budding romance is sweet, but the two actors do not have the magnetism or presence of Bloom and Knightley.

At this point, it would just seem odd, just seem ""straight-to-DVD"" to have a new film without Captain Jack. Depp is so memorable in the role that Captain Jack has become part of the film lexicon, much like Hannibal Lecter, Ripley, Danny Ocean and others. That said, in the new film, Depp really doesn't do anything new with the character. Everything seems rehashed or recycled, from his exaggerated flouncing about to the mannerisms borrowed from Keith Richards (who makes an improbable cameo). He also continues to shift his allegiance from moment to moment; he wants to help Angelica, then he enters into an allegiance with Barbossa, then he seems to be out to find the Fountain of Youth for his own gain. This was amusing and fun to watch in the first film. Now, in #4 (and the already announced fifth installment), its just more of the same. When you think about Johnny Depp's work, that is usually the last thing that comes to mind. Its sad when a once formidable talent, who used to do strange, unusual and exciting work, begins to do work that can be described as 'more of the same'.

Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa fares about as well as Depp. From the moment he shows up dressed in Royal Navy garb, we know he is playing a game to achieve some goal. When the goal is revealed, it comes as no surprise. Rush is a very good actor who has done many very good films. But he is clearly in this film for the money. I can't fault him for wanting to collect a big paycheck, but he could've done more with the role.

Penelope Cruz is fine as Angelica. She runs around with a certain sense of abandon and seems to have fun in the role. But the whole 'posing as Blackbeard's daughter' ruse is never explained or justified and just seems odd.

Ian McShane is the best part of this new movie. As Blackbeard, he introduces a new character, a new menace and it is fun to see this character come to life. When we first meet the fabled pirate, he leaves his stateroom to address his crew. Upset, he barely raises his voice, but his character and figure are still alarming, still menacing. His beard, the ends braided, is on fire. Why? Who knows, but he doesn't seem to notice or care.

Marshall seems to have fun breathing life into this story. The action scenes seem a little madcap and lively. In fact, I get the definite sense they are trying to shift the balance back to hand-to-hand combat away from heavy CGI work. There are a lot of personal fights and sword battles and very little heavy computer graphics. This is a nice idea, almost as though they are paying homage to the pirate and swashbuckler films of the 40s and 50s. Really, Depp's Sparrow is not that far from Burt Lancaster's ""The Crimson Pirate"". At least in temperament and tone.

An early scene in London provides an excuse for Sparrow to escape from the Royal Guard by jumping from the roof of one moving carriage to the next, swinging from bunting and falling into the lap of a very surprising cameo. Later, the swordfights and a scene between Sparrow and Barbossa aboard Ponce de Leon's shipwreck, all help to recreate the sense of daring and speed we love about the first (and maybe the second) ""Pirates"" films.

As Angelica is an old flame, Sparrow turns on the charm, trying to flirt his way back into her good graces. But these moments are too familiar and become boring. He tries the same moves on Keira Knightley in the first three films, with the same success rate, the same reactions and the same expressions when they don't work. Well, she isn't receptive this time, best to keep trying... And trying... And trying. The difference between Cruz's Angelica and Knightley's Elizabeth is that Angelica is allowed to flirt back every so often. Elizabeth was attached to (shudder) Will, Bloom's character. It took all of her energy to create something with that vacuum of emotion, she didn't have anything left for Depp. But seriously, because she and Will are always circling one another, and because these are Disney films, she couldn't show any interest or return Captain Jack's attentions. In ""Stranger Tides"", Angelica masquerades as Blackbeard's ""daughter"", leaving her free to flirt a little because she is romantically unattached.

I found the last ""Pirates"" film to be a complete misfire. It seemed like director Gore Verbinski was trying to legitimize the success of the series and make a 'serious' pirate film. That film runs for two hours and forty five minutes and the characters stand around and talk for a good two hours. These are popcorn films. Yes, we need story, we need character development. But if the writer(s) and director have their jobs well, they have created a viable, visual, interesting universe for the characters to inhabit. If they have done their job really well, they don't need to legitimize anything and the audience will enjoy the ride. For ""At World's End"", they didn't do their jobs that well.

So for ""Stranger Tides"", they made some changes. Depp is in practically every frame of the film, a big change from the last film. There is also very little exposition. If they take any time to elaborate the plot, they do so right before, during or right after some action. Marshall seems to get what this film should be. It should be fun. The amped up action and Jack's increased presence are good changes.

But the film suffers from too little exposition. The opening scenes in London involve Jack posing as a judge in an attempt to free his long-suffering First Mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally). Much later, they cross paths again and this seems to remind Jack of the man's very existence. Why go to so much trouble and risk to save someone only to completely forget about them? Later, there is a pretty significant plot hole which isn't necessary. Because the writers and director are creating this universe, they are creating the rules. If you have to break your own rules, you didn't do a good enough job in the first place.

""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is a step in the right direction. It features a good performance by McShane, but it is still far away from the magic of the first film.",1307059200,,9118,4.647642679900744
4304038,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"After reading several negative reviews about Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, I had small expectations when I went to see the film.  In my point-of-view, the critics are dead wrong.  One of the critical objections that I looked for was a lack of ""chemistry"" between Johnny Depp and Penelope Cruz. I don't know what the critic thought was missing but considering that neither Jack Sparrow nor Angelica can afford to trust the other, their performances were spot on.  I also cannot agree that Johnny Depp's performance was lacking anything; his performance had the freshness of the first film in the series.

On Stranger Tides is an entertaining movie with an excellent story that has several interesting twists and turns (some minor spoilers follow). The opening of the film finds Gibbs (perfectly played once again by Kevin McNally) on trial for being mistaken as Captain Jack Sparrow only to be saved by Sparrow impersonating a judge.  The elaborate escape that follows, with plenty of excellent stunt work (including a cameo by Dame Judi Dench), is beautifully carried out.  Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) has joined the Royal Navy in this installment and is seeking to be the first to find the Fountain of Youth for King George II (nicely played by Richard Griffiths of Harry Potter fame).  Barbossa is as slippery as usual but is never as ruthless as Blackbeard (Ian McShane) is.  It has been predicted that Blackbeard (who has an array of black magic powers) will meet his death soon so he will stop at nothing to be the first to the Fountain. The mermaids were a marvelous addition to the story.  I don't buy the comparisons to vampires just because the mermaids show fangs.  I also liked the role of Philip (the preacher, sensitively played by Sam Claflin) who falls in love with the captured mermaid Syrena (end of spoilers)

Altogether, On Stranger Shores is an entertaining action film. There is plenty to like from the special effects, to the verbal sparing between Penelope Cruz and Johnny Depp to the malevolent evil of Blackbeard.  This film is more a true successor to the original film in spirit and story than the second and third installments.",1307059200,2,2175,4.880434782608695

The third installment kind of rubbed me the wrong way because of excessive chatter and bargaining.  The script in this fourth one is merely the pause between many action scenes, and a wine cellar keg full of rambling shots involving sword fights, nasty escapes, and tumbling action aboard ships and village streets. The familiar soundtrack is here once again, proving the original filmakers knew what they were doing with the upbeat score.  Great fun if one can just give themselves up to fantasy with pirates ships, lost hearts, and vicious mermaids.  One of the Jack Sparrow best! Er, that's Capt. Jack Sparrow . . .",1306713600,,824,4.906474820143885
4304042,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is the fourth installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy... which should probably have stayed a trilogy. Gore Verbinski directed the original trilogy, but for reasons that defy understanding On Stranger Tides was put in the hands of Rob Marshall, a very talented director of musicals but one with no experience - and apparently no feel whatsoever - for action films. The differences are telling, and not in a good way.

There are some good parts to On Stranger Tides, particularly an early scene where Jack Sparrow meets King George II (marvelously done by Richard Griffiths).  But for the most part, as a film it resembles a ship caught in a storm, lurching this way and that in a barely controlled manner. Compared to the Gore Verbinski films, On Stranger Tides has a disjointed feel to it, with scene after scene feeling distinctly recycled, leaving the viewer with a sense of haven't-we-been-here-before? This is also hammered home by the Hans Zimmer score, half of which sounds like it was inserted without even the slightest changes from the earlier films.

In a nutshell, the basic plot is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) ends up being shanghaied by none other than Blackbeard (Ian McShane), arguably the most infamous pirate of all time, and his daughter, Angelica (Penelope Cruz), in a search for the legendary Fountain of Youth, pursued by former-pirate-now-privateer Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). There is a somewhat interesting romantic subplot involving a missionary (Sam Claflin) and a mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey), but it's almost a distraction from everything else and not enough to make up for the lack of heart in the rest of the film.

That said, the film lacks smoothness, scenes often change in a jarring manner, too many chase scenes going on far too long, and quite frankly, too much of Johnny Depp having to act in a vacuum. Given the acknowledged talent of most of the cast, one can only blame the director.  Ian McShane's Blackbeard is about as terrifying as your average surly drunk in a bar. Penelope Cruz's Angelica has all the passion of a fashion plate stepping through a photo shoot.  Even Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa and Kevin McNally's Gibbs feel like they're improvising most of the time, trying to remember how they did it the first time around.

The film also suffers from the changes among the minor pirate characters. The comic pirate pair Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) are completely absent from On Stranger Tides, a bizarre decision on someone's part, and their loss is keenly felt. A new character Scrum (Stephen Graham) has been added but is a pale and only mildly funny substitute. Another new character, credited only as Cabin Boy (appealingly played by fifteen-year-old Robbie Kay) had potential, but is largely wasted by being little to do except stand there and react.

There are two fun cameos in the film, one by Keith Richards reprising his role as Captain Teague, Jack's father, and Judi Densch as an aristocratic lady Jack unexpectedly drops in on (literally) while making his escape from the king. And they have arguably the best single lines in the film, which I won't spoil for you here.

On Stranger Tides is watchable, but only just, the kind of film you watch once and then largely forget. In truth, I can only recommend this for Johnny Depp/Jack Sparrow fans who want to see it all, even if the standards aren't up to the first three films.

PS -- In spite of the title referencing Tim Powers' marvelous pirate fantasy novel On Stranger Tides, the film only borrows a few plot elements - Blackbeard, the Fountain of Youth, zombies, etc - from the novel and otherwise has little to do with it. I highly recommend tracking down the novel and reading it though if you enjoy a really good supernatural pirate yarn.",1306713600,8,3836,4.887692307692308
4304043,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"It's not easy to impersonate Captain Jack Sparrow. For one thing, he's got that mincing walk. Still, someone's going around passing himself off as our favorite pirate, recruiting sea hands for a run at Ponce de Leon's mythical Fountain of Youth. And this poser isn't the only one after the key to life eternal. The Spanish are curious. The British are curious because the Spanish are curious. Edward Teach, a.k.a. the notorious pirate and dark sorcerer Blackbeard, is another buttinski. And, the honest-to-gosh real Captain Jack Sparrow, who had just about given up his own quest for the Fountain of Youth, reinvigorates himself to the cause. He has a map and all.

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a hell of a long title, and it's a fairly long movie. I liked it enough that I'm recommending it. But I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous three films (including the way over-the-top AT WORLD'S END). Turns out, I missed Kiera Knightley and Legolas something fierce. Turns out, Jack Sparrow is better served when he's coming at you sideways, when he's not featured as so obviously the central character. Partly, it's that, at this stage, we know that Jack Sparrow is a good guy, no matter that he walks like a silly ponce and that he sports sinister gold teeth and heavy eyeliner. By now, it's difficult for the film to employ trickeration on a savvy audience. And Jack Sparrow loses a bit of something when you know without a doubt that he's an honorable scoundrel. Even if he's still peculiar in his habits and methods.

Saving the ever reliable Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp has no actor with enough of a presence for him to effectively bounce off from, and right there I guess I just elevated Orlando Bloom's acting chops. The new characters don't resonate for me, not Penelope Cruz's winsome pirate's daughter (and Sparrow's old flame), not Ian McShane's cursed Blackbeard, and certainly not that actor who plays the uncharismatic missionary/clerk/all around boredom-on-legs.

Hell, I even miss that short, bald pirate and his mate with the wooden eye.

No surprise, the film is visually stunning; it looks very good. It's loud, bombastic, and drawn out. The f/x and stunts are rather spectacular. As ever, Jack Sparrow's antics are to be appreciated. I particularly liked the scene in the British king's palace, in which the movie audience sees a captive Jack, in delightful off-the-cuff fashion, plan and stage his eventual escape, a key component of which is that chandeliered dessert.

The film tries to distract you with plot candy such as lost magical chalices and mermaid's tears, and zombies and a Keith Richards cameo. But it all feels like filler. There's something missing from the core of the story. And Jack Sparrow, unruffled and odd and improvisational, is still best when utilized as misdirection. But, for that to be, you need someone else to also focus on. That missionary dullard sure can't cut the mustard or capture big screen interest. Which leaves Jack shouldering the hero tropes. Here, he's clearly the hero and central protagonist and even the lead in the love story. Jack, you've gone all domesticated, yo. It doesn't quite suit you.

I will say that Astrid Berges-Frisbey, who plays the mermaid Syrena, is a stunner. I do challenge the laws of gravity which always seemed to place her hair in such a strategic way that Disney is able to maintain its PG-13 rating.",1306540800,23,3410,4.870689655172414
4304044,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Just saw the movie and I can't understand the critics, who have generally panned it.

'On stranger tides' is the second best in the series (after the original, of course).

The story is strong and coherent, the acting is first class, and those mermaids ... ;);).",1306454400,4,262,4.673913043478261
4304045,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I caught ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" a few days after it opened in theaters, and liked it well enough. Thrills, laughs, scares, they're all there. However, it didn't have anywhere near the ambition and scope of the last couple of Pirates movies, ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End"", nor the variety of characters.

On that last point, there aren't many ""normal"" characters this time, like the previous films' Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) or Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), for the larger-than-life characters to contrast with and stand out against. Here, nearly everyone is a big, eccentric character... Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa, Ian McShane's Blackbeard, among others, which eventually makes everything feel somewhat over the top. Making these characters seem even more eccentric is the fact that there isn't a big, ambitious story for them to fill this time, just a fairly modest one about different interests racing to reach the Fountain of Youth.

Despite the smaller, less epic story, there are some high points in the movie, however, including a terrific set piece involving Blackbeard and his crew, with a conscripted Jack Sparrow along for the ride, trying to lure a school of mermaids into a trap, in order to secure the tears of one of the lovely but deadly creatures (the tears being needed to activate the Fountain of Youth once it's found). The whole mermaid sequence starts out bad for the hunters then gets worse, eventually resembling the ""Pirates"" version of a fire fight with the Vietcong. It's something to see.

I could tell you a few more things, some good and some less so, about the movie. But in the end, if you liked the other ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, you'll probably enjoy this one enough to justify a trip to the theater. You may even like it more than the last couple, if you felt those were getting a bit too bloated and complicated. Me, I found ""On Stranger Tides"" to be a bit of a step back in most key areas, but not enough of one to get upset about. I'm glad I saw it.",1306454400,2,2079,4.7855153203342615
4304046,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"Alright, let's just cut to the chase.  PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES is a huge disappointment.  It will make lots of money and spawn more sequels...but the spark has gone out, and frankly, I'm not sure anything will help.  As long as Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the major character, these films just aren't going to cut it.

Think back on the first film in the series POTC: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL (goodness, typing all these long titles is tedious).  It starred two lovely up-and-coming performers at the height of their popularity (Keira Knightley and especially Legolas...oh, I mean Orlando Bloom).  And Johnny Depp was there too...a popular, slightly hip actor.  And the film featured state of the art effects, some juicy supporting performances (especially from always reliable Geoffrey Rush) and was a burst of fresh air.  A lush pirate adventure that was actually fun!  Knightley and Bloom were lovely to look at and feisty and witty.  And Depp was a revelation.  His Sparrow was a unique and amazing creation.  (I won't run down all his now very familiar characteristics.)  So much so that Depp was nominated for an Oscar and went from modestly successful leading man to full blown STAR.  The world was drowned in Depp and we embraced his oddball characterizations.  He went on to receive another Oscar nomination for FINDING NEVERLAND and to considerable oddball success in more and more Tim Burton films.

Meanwhile, POTC: DEAD MAN'S CHEST arrived.  Packed even more full of effects, it still had lots of fun...but suffered from sequel-bloat.  More was not always more.  But I still found it quite enjoyable, with some stunt work that was fun (the big ""hamster ball"" scene is still clever).  Depp was now solidly the star, but Sparrow was still new enough that we wanted more.  But by the time POTC: AT WORLD'S END came along, the film was SO special effects laden, SO loud and SO Jack Sparrow centric that I felt the series was pretty much played out.  The movie was long and frequently boring.  Big CGI battle scenes were not enough to engage.  The characters were so familiar.  There was nothing new that Jack Sparrow could bring to the table.  His strange accent, odd mincing and fake-drunk demeanor were totally familiar.  But of course, we viewers attended dutifully and saw the series wrapped up.  The Knightley / Bloom characters had their arc more or less wrapped up (and by now, Bloom was not even remotely a movie star any more).  It was a disappointing end to a series that started so well...but it really did seem to be the end.

Now a new director and a producer Jerry Bruckheimer and star Depp have ""rebooted"" the series.  And in some ways, they have listened to the criticisms of the past.  The special effects, while still impressive, are significantly dialed down.  There has been an effort to return to character and not just noise for the sake of it.  And aside from Depp & Rush, they've pretty much abandoned all the previous characters.  But Sparrow is still very much the focus, and with stripping away most other distractions, it was painfully clear to me that Sparrow has nothing left to offer us.  There is NO surprise left in this character.  Depp tries hard...but he's not really acting any more, he's recreating mannerisms that once grew organically from Depp the actor.  He's become Depp the Jack Sparrow impersonator.  He can put on the makeup and costume...but not really anything more than a characterization.  Sparrow is a cartoon now.

The movie still features some clever ""chase"" scenes, including an early scene involving horses and carriages that feels like something Jackie Chan might have staged.  But there's lots of talking in the first half of the film.  Lots of exposition.  Something to do with finding the fountain of youth, and who has stolen whose ship and why is the pirate Barbossa now the captain of an English military vessel.  And who is this woman (Penelope Cruise) with a complicated past history with Depp?  They were clearly lovers once, but are now bitter rivals.  But that romantic spark remains.  (Yet Cruz and Depp have no chemistry.  Really, when was the last time Johnny Depp had any real romantic chemistry with an actress?)  And then it turns out she's working with the evil pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane)...the most evil pirate ever.  I found the first hour of this two hour fifteen minute film to be mostly quite tedious, and my eyelids frequently drooped.)

Things perked up a bit when Blackbeard and his crew reach the mysterious island where mermaids live.  These mermaids are gorgeous sirens who lure men to them and then turn into some fairly vicious, fanged creatures.  The scene when Blackbeard is trying to trap one of these creatures is actually pretty impressive, and my interest in the film finally rose above lukewarm.  But that interest waned fairly soon.  And when Depp and Rush teamed up towards the end, I realized that the same ""been there, seen that"" feeling I had about Sparrow also applied to Rush's Barbossa.  Rush brings his best efforts, but the character is what it is...and so he's grown tiresome too.

As always, the films are technically impeccable.  (I'd advise saving your money and passing on the 3D version.  That's what I saw, and the 3D added nothing to the film except unneeded darkness.)  But with a needlessly complicated plot, awkward exposition and a lead character who has evolved from surprisingly delightful to dishearteningly mundane...the PIRATES series has worn out its welcome.",1306454400,9,5527,4.859592711682744
4304057,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"I say this movie in theaters and it was amazing! I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it at first because I am not a big pirates fan, and I had never seen any of the other movies. But once I saw it, I was glad I went! Johnny Depp played his part well! The movie was exciting and had many laughs! I would recommend this movie to anyone!",1306195200,,331,3.742857142857143
4304058,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"I am really unsure of how to sum up On Stranger Tides in simple words. Before I begin this review, let me state 2 things: 1. I absolutely love the first three movies, and 2. To that guy who said ""the skinny girl is not in the movie"", that skinny girl is named Kiera Knightley. OK, now moving on, sort of.

The first three movies were good old fashioned fun that didn't take themselves too seriously. I enjoyed them all very much and have seen them numerous times. I thought Verbinski did a hell of a job, considering he was a punk rock video director before a filmmaker. When I heard a fourth movie was being made, I got super excited. However, I had a stirring feeling of disappointment when I found out Verbinski was not directing. I'm not down with Rob Marshall- I thought Chicago was overrated and Nine was a confusing and slow mess. But, it's a Pirates movie, so I figured it'd be fun.

Since I'm kinda pressed for time, I will sum up what I liked and didn't like.

FIrst, the cast were great as per usual. Visually it was entertaining and the movie moved along at a nice pace... for the first hour. That, and Penelope Cruz is hot!!! And she did a great job as Angelica. Blackbeard was a cool villain, and Ian McShane does a fantastic job. There's a creepy scene involving mermaids, and that got a good reaction from those at the theatre.

The bad... is everything else. First off, Barbossa is in the movie for only 20 minutes. The last hour is boring, drags a lot, and that's not all- there's a MAJOR plot hole involving the fountain of youth which is really annoying. And the 3D sucked.

Overall, this is not a bad movie, but the writers are running out of ideas and it's clear.

PROS:
-Great acting
-Hans Zimmer's score rules
-Nice after the credits coda

CONS
-Pointless characters including the mermaid and the religious dude
-About 30 minutes too long
-Jack thinks far too much in this film
-Drags greatly in the second half",1306108800,11,1935,4.418539325842697
4304059,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"In recent years, we've had franchises return for a fourth installment. Indiana Jones. Die Hard. Rambo. Scream. All of varying worth. Many critics say that these long running franchises returning for a 4th film never live up to the hype or to the series they are a part of. Well, 'Pirates 4' comes along to change all that. It is a sequel, coming 4 years after the last one(which is like 10 years in this generation where last week is old), it is a part 4, and it's wonderful. Critics say otherwise, but this is one movie where the audience has spoken, and they are loving it.

I could go into the story, but why bother? By now, everyone should know that Capt. Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp)is back, and he is journeying to the famed fountain of youth, along with old foe Barbarossa(the great Geoffrey Rush), evil Pirate Blackbeard(the even better Ian McShane), and old flame Angelica(Penelope Cruz) who may or may not be Blackbeard's daughter. Along the way, our characters run across exciting adventures and scary mermaids.

First of all, people and critics were quite vocal on how the two sequels were too complicated, over-stuffed, and confusing. Thankfully, this latest adventure simplifies the material in a way that harkens back to the wonderful, and now classic, original 2003 film. There is now B and C storylines to dampen down the festivities. Everything is pretty simple and crystal clear and easy to follow along. In fact, the whole movie has such a refreshing air to it, that it really does go back to the original. The immense charm of the original film with Depp's Sparrow and humor is here in full force. The magic is there. The fun time, popcorn blockbuster is there. Part 3 was disappointing and was missing most of this, but it's here in spades with part 4. Also in abundance is the action. Part 3 was so long that the action felt few and far between. Here, there is plenty of action. The movie never slows down and is never boring. Ever. New director Rob Marshall keeps things moving at a fun and brisk pace. It's continuously watchable and gorgeous, like all the others, to look at. It is, without a doubt, the most fun and entertaining movie in the franchise since the first one.

The cast is great. Johnny Depp is these movies. People come to see him in this role and he doesn't disappoint in this one. He seems more alive, lively, refrshed, and as amusing as ever. Elsewhere, you will be wondering ""Orlando and Keira who?"" You won't miss them. Penelope Cruz holds her own as Angelica. Rush is as great as he always is in the other films. And then there is Ian McShane. He is just cool. Blackbeard is a character to be reckoned with, and McShane is so evil and icy cool, that he owns every scene he is in. There are new characters littered throughout the film, but none of them really bring much. I will say though, that the actrss who plays Serena the mermaid, and I don't remember her name, may be one of the loveliest beauties I have seen on the silver screen in some time.

The critics have not been kind. Some have been downright savage, and I cannot understand why. The audienc I saw it with clapped at the end. ""On Stranger Tides"" may not be so strange, but it delivers what everyone wants and hopes for in a Pirate's movie. Easily the best of the sequels, the movie is great fun. It has a new zest of life and has a sharp script filled with rousing action, some great dialogue, and some great humor.  What more can you ask for? I am a huge fan of the franchise. Part 3 was not what everyone wanted, but ""On Stranger Tides"" does a great job of steering this mighty franchise back on course. Part 5 cannot come fast enough!",1306108800,164,3647,4.494720965309201
4304060,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"Don't get me wrong.  I adore Capt Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp did a marvelous job (as always) in this latest movie.  The continuation of Capt Barbossa (Rush) in the series and the addition of Blackbeard (McShane) were wonderful, even though I must say that Blackbeard came across far less evil and interesting than the previous bad guys in Dead Man's Chest and At World's End--the East India Co man and Davey Jones.  Instead, Blackbeard came across as a cardboard cutout of a bad guy and I know (from Deadwood) that McShane is a way better actor than that.

I think that's part of the problem.  The new characters simply weren't up to snuff.  It would have been so much better to have brought along more of the secondary characters from the previous movies, and not just Mr Gibbs.  The main secondary character from Blackbeard's ship who provided a few funny scenes came the closest, but I couldn't even remember the name of the preacher-guy during the movie, let alone after the movie.  The love interest between him (spoilers ahead!) and the mermaid fell flat...as flat as the love interest between Capt. Jack and Angelica (Cruz).  Honestly, there seemed to be no spark there at all.  I know that Penelope Cruz is also a better actress than this.

In fact, the whole movie suffered from a lack of the ol' sparkle and magic that I've come to expect from the Pirates movies.  I don't know who to blame--the scriptwriters and the new director spring to mind.  There were too many scenes that served little to no purpose plotwise and the climax of the movie was anything but.  Sure, there were some great scenes and one-liners, but the script seemed to suffer from a lack of general cohesion and the effort to be ""simpler"" than At World's End.  The story sometimes seemed to get lost and, honestly, came across amateurish at times.  The scene with the guns at the edge of the gorge really was a waste of time--yeah, it showed that Blackbeard really didn't care about his daughter, but we already knew that.  It would have been far better not knowing which way he might go up until the end than having it spelled out for us almost from the beginning.  Again, no sparks, little surprise.  It almost felt ""dumbed down"" at times.

Basically, the movie galloped along from action scene to action scene and Jack displayed his wonderful wayward roguish charm and the scenery and special effects were great...but at the end, all of it felt a bit too forced and flat.  The scriptwriters should have taken another whack at it before letting it out the door.

I will buy this movie when it comes out on BR, for sure, but not because it was my favorite Pirates movie.  I can only hope that the next one will be better.  Perhaps, they need to bring back the original director?  Clearly, they need to do something.  This is not the way to go.",1306108800,4,2827,4.570576540755467
4304061,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"I'll admit that this installment is better than the previous two movies, but definitely not better than the original. Only Jack Sparrow, Barbossa, and Gibbs return for this adventure. Elizabeth, Will, Pintel, Ragetti, Cotton, and Marty are gone, but it's still an interesting hilarious action-packed new chapter in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise. Jack is still up to his old tricks and is asked by King George II to lead an expedition to find the Fountain of Youth. Jack must soon deal with his former lover, Angelica, who happens to be the daughter of the new villian, Blackbeard. They need the tear of a Mermaid and two silver chalices to make the fountain work.

I much prefer the 3D version.  I was not disappointed at all.  I never listen to the critics, I figure that I need to formulate my own opinion verses going on someone elses.

4304063,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Firstly, to clarify, this is really a *** and 1/2 movie and not quite a four star.

The first Pirates movie came out of left field for most viewers and especially serious critics.  How could a film based on a ride really be anything good?  Then the film came out and blew all away.  Sure, it's too long and gets a bit repetitive towards the third act but it mostly works and could very well be a future classic.  The most surprising thing was that Johnny Depp created an iconic character that ranks up their with James Bond or Indiana Jones.  I wasn't surprised but mostly because I feel that Depp is the modern Brando, but without the career slumps up and down.  Then of course we get our sequels, like the 80's being rehashed, EVERYTHING gets a sequel, spin-off or prequel these days.  It's fairly boring, but has its pleasures.  The sequels were written with a trilogy in mind.  Basically events in the first film were now made more important to connect it with the second and third film with mixed results.  I loved Dead Man's Chest.  It was fun, bombastic, and had tons of original and cool visuals to go along with an inventive new villain Davey Jones.  What is this you say?  You liked part 2 better than 3?!?!?!  But part 2 was basically a long trailer for the third film!  Yeah, and I say sometimes the trailers for movies are better than the actual movies.  The problem with the sequels were that they made their plots waaaaaaaay too convoluted and overly stuffed.  While the second was a huge fun set up, the third film's pay off wasn't that great or exciting or rewarding.  On top of that it seemed to meander for no real reason towards the middle, with very little action, and finally gave us an epic third act battle to veg out on.  While I think the first film was great, the second good, and the third okay, I'm still a pretty big fan of the series, but especially of the Depp created Jack Sparrow.  I didn't understand why they didn't just create a series called The Adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow and drop the rest.  Well, this fourth film is the closes thing to that so far.....

Firstly, the strained Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom stories truly have been ended as the third film suggested.  Thank you.  It was getting hard to figure out why their characters were even in the sequels after a while.  Hell, Knightly's Elizabeth Swan got shoehorned into playing a plot point as a Pirate lord at the end of the third film and it became laughable, not only because she wasn't believable but because it was obvious that her character had no plot function anymore and the writer's could only come up with that.  Here Jack Sparrow finally gets front and center.  His character drives the action and the film is being told through his character's eyes and not Elizabeth Swan's.  This is a Jack adventure.  Which is right.  Jack should be like James Bond and Indiana Jones.  The film's don't need continuity.  Just give us more Jack adventures.  I always found it funny that people referred to the Indiana Jones films as a trilogy before the fourth film came out.  All three, now four, films are disconnected.  They're just serialized adventures with a main character, and some side characters, in common.  I like this and Pirates looks like it's headed there.

I don't do plot synopsis, Amazon has been goodly enough to do it for us all, but I'll give a quick overview.  Basically, Jack, Barbosa(a returning Geoffrey Rush, who is now working for King George in the Royal Navy), Spanish Conquisidors, and Blackbeard(Ian Mcshane) with his first mate daughter Angelica(A very sassy and fun Penelope Cruz) by his side are all on a race to find and use the Fountain of Youth.  They all have their purposes.  They all cross paths. Some of their relationships have intertwined in the past.  They all come together in the third act.  That's it.  Jack leads the way and gets in the way of all.

Cast additions of Ian Mchshane and Penelope Cruz are great.  Cruz and Depp are so over the top in their scenes together that you can see right away why they were lovers.  Mcshane plays a straight up villain, more so than Rush did in the first, and about on the same level as Nighy in the second and third.  Blackbeard's ship is a great addition the usually murky gobbledy-gook superantural junk of the Pirates universe.  It's a living ship that does the will of whoever is holding a special sword.  It's creates some great ominous visuals and one great FX sequence in particular.

We also get some mermaids.  They play a vital part to the plot due to our character needing a single mermaid tear, along with two cups, to activate the fountain of youth.  They are built up as such terrors at the top of the film not only are you amped up to finally see them, but you are also a little terrified.  When they show up they don't disappoint.  Sure, when their fangs drop and they attack, it's far less scar then the docile, beautiful versions that greet our sailors, but that's the way it always goes with monsters in movies.

While this film is loaded with big visuals and tons of visual effects, all good BTW, it doesn't seem to go as far over the top as the previous two sequels.  It is not trying to top or outdo the previous films.  It all stays in tone and characters witht he particular story being told in this film.  Although, I have to admit, the new villainous characters are not as awe-inspiring or interesting as the ones presented in the previous installments.  As cool as the mermaids are they don't hold a candle to undead skeletal pirates or monster fishmen.  Oh well.

My only complaints come down to the fact that the film is a four and the routine is wearing mildy thin.  It's not as weird as I would want, as the character of Jack Sparrow warrants.  I want more and weirder.  This is a safer film than the last two films, but not as adventureous in the right measure as the first.  Also, the editing is somewhat annoying.  It's loaded with swashbuckling but it's not played out in an exciting way.  It's all created with fast editing, basically showing great acts but without ever making it believable or grand.  We can FEEL the edits and how they are the stars of the action and not the acts themselves.  This is an annoying and common trait of action movies today.  If you're going to do sword fight then study Errol Flynn or, for a more modern example, the great(probably the greatest on film) finale sword fight between Liam Neeson and Tim Roth in Rob Roy.  Less obvious tech and more actual technique would be great!

Rob Marshall does a fine job stepping up to the director's chair for series stalwart Gore Verbinski.  His sword fights, while annoyingly edited, do have a dancer's rhythm to them that I enjoyed.  Writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio also return and their simplified and more in line with the first film's storytelling is good and as usual witty.  I was happy, but hunger for more.  It's worth checking out.

PS: I saw this in 2-D not 3-d.  This trend is boring and pointless.  I want my movies to suck me in with character and story not with gimmicks.  Plus, most modern 3-D with exceptions(Avatar and How to Train your Dragon spring to mind) makes the picture darker and murky for some reason, and I don't like viewing my films like it's being watched through a dirty eye glass lense covered in vasoline.  If you dig 3-D then good for you, but I get the feeling that you're not much older than 12 or maybe even 13.....",1306022400,5,7460,4.502609992542879
4304064,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"Very enjoyable movie!  It is about opposing forces, all in search of Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth.  Our hero, Captain Jack Sparrow/Johnny Depp, also has to contend with the infamous Blackbeard the Pirate (Ian McShane).  Penelope Cruz plays Angelica, a swash-buckling counterpart to Captain Jack who is obviously enamored with him.  Much of the film is on the sea, as one would expect.  We encounter mermaids on our journey which are not the nice ones we are used to - but then, they don't think humans are very nice either.

It's a good time, all 2 hours 21 minutes of it!  There's lots of action, stunts, and funny one-liners with impeccable timing (e.g. I hope there are no termites in your wooden leg.) The movie was engaging the entire time.

I LOVED the film and would definitely watch it again.  I give it 5 stars.

My 37-year old son also loved it.  He has watched the other 3 Pirates of the Caribbean movies many times.  He gives it a 4  star.  The only thing he found was he believed the music to be not as well synced with the scenes as the other 3 movies.  He would watch it again also.",1306022400,2,1102,4.3861386138613865
4304065,5,B004A8ZWUQ,"""Pirates Of The Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is great! This is how the story goes: When Captain Jack Sparrow crosses paths with the enigmatic Angelica, he's not sure if it's love -- or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the ""Queen Anne's Revenge,"" the ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard, Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past.

The cast led by Johnny Depp (returning in his Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack Sparrow), Penelope Cruz (as Angelica), Ian McShane (as Blackbeard) & Geoffrey Rush (also back as Barbossa) is great. The directing by Rob Marshall is great. The screen story (based on suggestion of the novel ""On Stranger Tides"" by Tim Powers) & screenplay by Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio (both of them also executive produced) is great.

The music by Hans Zimmer is great. The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski is great. The film editing by David Brenner & Wyatt Smith is great. The casting by Lucy Bevan is great. The production design by John Myhre is great. The art direction by Drew Boughton, John Chichester, Robert Cowper, Zack Grobler & Tomas Voth is great. The set decoration by Gordon Sim is great. The costume design by Penny Rose is great. The special and visual effects are great.

This is a great summer movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart racing and your mind guessing, at the same time. This is just as great as the first three ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movies. This is one of the best movies of the summer season, so far.",1306022400,2,1672,4.680272108843537
4304066,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"""On Stranger Tides"" marks a return of our favorite pirate to the Carribean with the same gusto and pomp that made three long movies riveting and entertaining, also the return of Jerry Brukheimer as producer, and Teddy Rossio and Ted Elliot as the perpetual writers of this franchise. It also marks the return of many a memorable character such as Geoffrey Rush as the newly-maimed privateer Hector Barbossa and ever-lovable Kevin McNally as Joshamee Gibbs. Introduction of new characters such as Black Beard (Ian McShane) and Angelica (Penelope Cruz) are a most welcome change.

From sweeping Carribean landscapes to the civilised world of London, this journey takes us across many rivers, streams and canyons in search for the Fountain of Youth, with different groups all searching for it for their own reasons and purposes. Although there are many things to praise about the look and execution of the movie and the level of escapism it provides to the viewer, I find it more conducive at this juncture to comment on the main failings of this fourth venture of the franchise.

There, now that the bad stuff is out of the way, time to explore the exciting parts. No sense in repeating it, but Johnny Depp delivers. Every scene that he is in is a blast, though I was expecting a better entrance. Sparrow's clever ways to get into and out of trouble are hilarious to the point of amazement and his incredulous habit of making things up as he goes along is extended here and to great effect.

Penelope gives a refreshing change of pace as the leading woman, and it is interesting to know about Sparrow's foggy past life. Barring a few missteps, Cruz does a pretty good job, coming off as a good contender for Sparrow's better half.

Ian Mcshane steals the show. It is clear he took this job seriously and did his homework, because Black Beard actually comes off as the Pirate All Pirates Fear. Honestly, I never believed anyone could pull that role off, but Ian does and fills the viewers with a sense of respect and fear for the character.

Geoffrey Rush has brushed up his act, but with an Oscar nomination in his wake, I expected him to deliver more. It is clear that he is meant to stay in this franchise, but honestly, his gravitas and cruel sense of humor in the first movie can never be matched, and apparently not by his own self.

 Hopefully in the sequel we will see a grand return of Barbossa to his older days of Pirate glory. And why was the monkey actually not there?

The 3D is always great and a few scenes actually give you a sense of satisfaction for money-well-spent.
This is a minor gripe. Although they re-hired Hans Zimmer as the music director for this movie, I felt he re-used most of his formerly loved cues and music themes. We have come to expect a lot more from you, Hans, now that you have proved yourself a master music director.

Go watch it anyway. It is fun for the entire family. No wait, it just might not be suitable for children below 13.",1306022400,,2972,4.571428571428571
4304067,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"It's already been four years since the last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, now Jack Sparrow and his matey's are returning for a third sequel with On Strangers Tide. This fourth Pirates of the Caribbean film is of course going to be a bit different from previous Pirates movie as a result of the original trilogy concluded and some characters that are no longer present.  This time the charismatic Jack Sparrow is on a new quest this time looking for the fountain of youth, with some old acquaintances of past making an appearance.  On Strangers Tide wastes no time and goes straight into action and asks questions later. There is more dialogue and development in the second half of the film than in the first half, where the viewer is thrown into action almost right away. Pirates of the Caribbean movies always take a certain time to really get started but this one is exception to the rule. At 137 minutes, On Strangers Tide is a little shorter than the previous two POTC films, Dead Man's Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007) but its length is still over 2 hours and comparable to The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)'s 143 minutes.

Will and Elisabeth are not in this fourth film but I didn't miss them or at least not as much as I thought I would. While it would have been nice to see Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley return (maybe they will in a future Pirates who knows?), this movie kept me plenty interested and those actors not being present did not hurt the movie at all. Johnny Depp remains excellent as Jack Sparrow this fourth time around, as good as ever.  Geoffrey Rush was once more terrific as Barbossa. Penelope Cruz was great as Angelica, a former lover of Sparrow and daughter of Blackbeard. Depp and Cruz had on screen chemistry and were believable and worked out well. Ian McShane delivered a solid performance as Blackbeard but I guess I somehow expected him to be a more frightening character perhaps because of the Blackbeard legend. I can understand why some fans may not enjoy this fourth entry as much as the others. Some reviewers complained that the movie has too much action and maybe that's true but I can hardly see a fan of the series hating this one, liking it less or being disappointed perhaps. The fountain of youth was a decent enough storyline and the inclusion of the mermaids was a nice one and was very fitting into this Pirate universe (I still think they don't have fangs). To me, the mermaid attack scene shown in the previews is a highlight of the movie. I was slightly worried about the zombie pirates because I thought it may have been too over the top but that turned out fine as well. I quite liked the concept for this fourth film, the chase for the fountain of youth, and I thought the inclusion of famed pirate Blackbeard and the mermaids were interesting and in a way even breathed new life into the series while still being familiar and true to the previous films.

As for the 3D effect I must say it was surprisingly good, I don't mean amazing or revolutionary but I simply like how the effects didn't overshadow any event or were purely useless. What we have with On Strangers Tide is an effective 3D and that's coming from someone who's not a fan of 3D films. They didn't make the movie about 3D which some modern movies do; this one doesn't rely solely on 3D effects because it doesn't have to.

I like On Strangers Tide and find it to be a very enjoyable Pirates film overall, to me this one is much better than the third film, At World's End. On Strangers Tide may not be the best POTC movie but it has an interesting story, is entertaining and watchable which as far as sequels are concerned is always a good thing. I feel OST is maybe a little less complicated than earlier Pirates film, it's easier to follow that someone who has never seen any POTC films would not be lost. This is Definitely not the best in the series but to me is superior to the previous entry and manages to be a worthwhile sequel that was better than anticipated. It's been four years since the last POTC movie but even with two of the original characters gone, this one manages to be a very good sequel and perhaps, makes way for a new trilogy (there is after all, some talk about making 1 or 2 more movies). Some fans and critics didn't like it but I sure did. 4/5.",1306022400,,4309,4.4481012658227845
4304068,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Johnny Depp returns to the well once more for Pirates 4- On Stranger Tides. Losing some original cast members doesn't hurt as the movie is action filled, scary in spots and with many good special effects.
Early on in the movie there is a big chase scene through Old London which is vry well done. Another higlight is the dramatic and scary  mermaid attack scene. The plot is a bit easier to follow here than in the earlier sequels also. As always, Depp is great as Jack and he gets good support from the rest of the cast. Cruz is good but her role doesn't give her all that much to do, still a very entertaining sequel- 4 stars.",1306022400,,628,4.277310924369748
4304069,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"Depp adeptly keeps this franchise fresh, this time with the quest for the fountain of youth. As always, Jack Sparrow navigates the straits between the straight-laced royal military, the villains mor evillainous than he is, and the supernatural forces that he seems to take for granted so casually. Chemistry with Penlope Cruz works well, but lacks some of the spark he had with Keira Knightley. Effects work beautifully, even if a few seem not to have been thought through fully. (That aquarium full of water would have weighed what? And would have taken how many to carry it?) The romance between two side characters adds a sweet touch to the mix, too.

This isn't the first ""summer movie"" of this summer season, but it sets the bar high for the ones that follow.

Although Geoffrey Rush returns as Capt. Barbossa as well as Sparrow's first-mate. This time Jack is searching for the Fountain of youth. Ian McShane (of Deadwood is electric as BlackBeard. Penelope Cruz is mostly forgettable , the mermaids may have the uppper hand for on screen female presence. I certainly enjoyed it more than the last movie of the film series. The ending is painfully predictable, but it made infinitely more sence than the last two... Although clearly every pirate in the Disney Universe is packing magic and zombies..

4304074,3,B004A8ZWUQ,"It has been a while since a film has struck me the way Pirates 4 did. I would have to say, the best I can compare it to is Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  It was an ok movie, I liked it, although I can't really say why I did.  Its confusing, while you have soooo many complaints its just something you cannot say you disliked.

The basic plot of Stranger Tides is the Fountain of Youth's existence has come to light and England, Spain, and cutthroats are all racing to find it.  Some have maps, others have Jack to lead.  Some want it for glory, some want it to destroy, and some want it to try and stop a prophecy of their own death.  A breath of fresh air as far as plot goes.  Jack actually organizes a rescue or 2 rather than planning his own (although there are plenty of his classic escapes)  All in all, A+ for whoever thought up this concept.  Mermaids actually play a huge role in Stranger Tides as well.  About time!  I think we all knew eventually they would make their way in though, come on, whats a sea story without one?!

Pirates 4 had real potential to be something great.  While it wasn't a bad movie, it was by no means what it could have been.  There is a lot of action, a few drastic changes of environment, and new characters.  However, some of those attributes also contribute to the film's weak points.  There seems to be a lot of disconnection between 3 & 4.

BEFORE YOU SAY I must not have watched the 3rd one because it ended with Barbossa losing a part of his chart to Sparrow, who ran off in search of the Fountain of Youth, and Barbossa was captain of the Black Pearl, yes, I do realize this.  It did set up On Stranger Tides.  However, when I say there is disconnection, I meant from some key characters.  I felt some important elements were left out and some loose ends need to be tied up.  I know if we didn't introduce new characters and get off of the Flying Dutchmen subject Pirates would just end up being a tired series of recycled material.  But still, I felt like some things could have been faded in and out better.  Possibly it was just the extreme shock of a completely new storyline that wouldn't take 3 films to finish.

I won't put in any spoilers, but there are some events that have led up to Pirates 4 that we never saw or had a clue about (such as where was Black Beard when the Brethren met, he is a pirate after all and I would think with his magic he would have played a key role in imprisoning Calypso).  The absence of Bloom and Knightley is unexplained.  While they both started taking roles in 3 that would seperate them from the main idea of Pirates, Stranger Tides makes it feel like they are trying to completely erase that they ever existed.  A lot of supporting characters that made the films have been removed and that is why Jack Sparrow isn't very entertaining in my opinion.  What made Jack such a great character was his company, the way he interacted with other people and he is just lacking material to work with in Stranger Tides.

Blackbeard was a welcome addition, but he was very much out of left field (much like Jack's love interest Angelica, who we had no idea even existed until now).  I know it was time for a new villian, but ease them in, don't just slap Blackbeard down with all the characters knowing who he was and fearing him worse than anything on the sea.  Surely as much sailing as they have done they would have at least mentioned him by now.  He sticks out like a sore thumb.

Another complaint is the movie's production is not near as good as the first 3.  The soundtrack both in score and quality, the grunge-like appearance of the actual filming, and some of the acting is shoddy.  Giffiths' King George is so horrible I had to turn my head.  There is a lot of action in the film that builds really good suspense, but its all kind of like a play-by-play.  Jack's opening escape scene is so awkward and unbelievable until its hard to watch.  Its almost like they have ran out of ways for him to jump on and hang off of things.

While I have a lot of complaints there is still something about this film I liked.  I would say its an ok addition to the series and would serve as a good time filler while they work on a Pirates that will rule all pirate movies.  I pray they make a 5th to redeem the winning streak that I felt was nearly ended by Stranger Tides.  The title does serve the movie well as you get an incredibly new and interesting story line.  If you liked the first 3, this movie will give you your pirates fix, but it won't be something you rush out to see for the 2nd time in a week.  Sparrow fans may love the extreme focus put on Jack.  Gibbs was luckily brought back as I felt he was always such a great characters.  Barbossa plays a big role in this film and has some twists and turns of his own that made me actually like him for once (he kind of got annoying to me after he came to life, seemed like they forced him back into existing).

I suggest this film for Pirates fans but please lower your expectations.  You're going to get all that good action that you are used to but you're going to get a lot of confusion and boring attempts at thickening the plot to go with it.",1305936000,,5193,4.219066937119676
4304075,2,B004A8ZWUQ,"While the action is good, Jack Sparrow is charming as ever and some parts are funny; there are certain aspects that pull this film down. The plot of this film is very disjointed and poorly written, , Jack, Angelica and other characters are always bickering, the mermaids have vampire fangs (WTF? O_O) and there are too many plot twists and turns that hinder the movie from top to bottom which makes the plot hard to care about. The plot twists and turns worked well in the first movie but they don't do well in the sequels considering how the plots of them don't turn out well. Anywho this movie would've been better if it's issues were fixed. It's not an awful film, but it certainly isn't the worst; its medicore yet enjoyable. 6.5/10",1305849600,4,736,4.541353383458647
4304076,4,B004A8ZWUQ,"...and after the sound thrashing the critics gave it, I was not expecting to.
No spoilers, I promise.

Is it worth seeing in the theater?
Did you enjoy the first three?
Then the answer is a resounding yes.
I think the critics were expecting more of a rebirth for the franchise and that's not what this movie is.
It's called part 4 for a reason lol.
It's a definite continuation.
It was a little weird not having Orlando and Keira there but the new actors brought a wonderful new dimension to the film that after a few minutes I didn't miss Orlando or Kiera...not that I wouldn't mind seeing them in a future installment.
Ian McShane and Penelope Cruz were wonderful and perfect for this film.

So what was good?
Pretty much everything.
It's a Pirates of the Caribbean movie folks.
It's got action, action, and more action.
I've heard other complaints that it was paced too slowly.
???
Are you kidding, for a two hour plus movie this flew right by me.
The acting was excellent.
The score, pacing, cinematography was perfect.
A lot of people were turned off by the story line in part 3 and yes, it had it's moments of who's on first, who's on second, who is double crossing who in what scene from the next.
""Stranger Tides"" does not suffer from this.
The story was interesting and enjoyable but not difficult to follow.

What didn't I like?
The first half of the movie is VERY heavy on action with little bits of dialog in between the chaos...not enough dialog actually.
The second half of the movie cuts back on the action and gives us way more character development and story.
The second half was actually much more enjoyable for me as the first half felt a tad unbalanced.

That minor gripe aside..if you loved 1,2 and 3 of the Pirates franchise, you'll enjoy this.
Not a rebirth but a darn good continuation of a series I love.
The magic has NOT been lost...
Funny.
A great story.
Incredible acting from everyone.
Entertaining.
Action...lots of it.
Can't wait for part 5.
Highly recommended.",1305849600,432,1993,4.558659217877095
