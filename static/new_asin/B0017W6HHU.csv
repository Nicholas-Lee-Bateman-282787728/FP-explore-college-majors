The CJ Nelson footage is good, but overall I am disappointed with some of the log segments because they are constantly shown at off speeds. The section with Tudor and Machado surfing Costa Rica is very good and makes the whole film worth owning for me. The biggest let down for me is the political stuff which adds nothing to the film and makes you want to skip ahead. If you are into boards that aren't standard shortboards it's worth a watch, but it could have been even better with some minor tweaks.",1426723200,,634,4.427350427350428
8267613,5,B0017W6HHU,"This is honestly one of the best surf films I've ever watched! I'm a huge fan of surf films and have seen hundreds since I started surfing as a grom in the 1980s.  This video has a little bit of everything (longboarding, shortboarding, bodysurfing, sponge/boogie boarding, shaping, etc) and a whole lotta soul! This is a great video to play for people who are not surfers as the visual style of the film is very well done and can capture anyone's attention.  All though the video does go overboard at times with the style and art it really makes it something special. I cannot stress enough if you haven't seen this GO WATCH IT!",1372204800,,628,4.5
8267614,4,B0017W6HHU,"This is a great movie - the footage is beautiful and the soundtrack is wonderful and non-traditional. It has the feel of an early 70s surf flick, something like Cosmic Children. There are longboards and shortboards and the surfing is just incredible. The fun that these guys have in the waves is palpable and their respect for the sport comes through as well. I particularly like the segment featuring Dave Rastovich, who is this generation's true soul surfer. It was a wise move to use his voice for the commentary in this part of the movie.

The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because I found the conquistador segment completely out of context with the rest of the movie. It didn't work regardless of one's political stance, it just didn't work in my opinion. Stick to surfing please.

So buy it. Keep these guys making movies. These are so much better than the average surf movie.",1313884800,2,892,4.60377358490566
8267615,2,B0017W6HHU,"This movie was really looking better than the seedling, he wasn't trying as hard to be college artsy and seemed to be sticking to entire ride surfing and music and less tortuously unfunny comedy bits but then he has to insert some lame out dated blame whitey crap and ruin the feel of the movie. Maybe hes forgotten that yes whitey did conquer the Americas but we also lived thru our own conquests from Attila, Ghengas Kahn and numerous Muslim invasions and brutal occupations that lasted for centuries. Everybodys killed everybody else get over it. Quit dragging personal divisive politics into a freakin surf movie. Although the surfing is good, especially the fish section and its got Skip Frye in it I wish hadnt given Thomas a dime of my money now.
 As with Seedling get your fast fwd button ready.",1301443200,3,803,4.695035460992908
8267616,5,B0017W6HHU,"This film is the Breathless, Citizen Kane, or Seven Samurai of surfing.  Trying to qualify why it is great is hard for me.  Trust me.  Watch this, let it change your life.",1297209600,,171,4.28125
8267617,4,B0017W6HHU,"I love this movie for its simplicity and use of multiple approaches to riding waves. The opening section of Dan Malloy, Belen and Alex Knost surfing in India is unique. Liked the section of log riding with the ladies. Grace and flow. Mike and Mike is a fun one. Overall the movie keeps you in the flow, but then Thomas talks a little too much in some sections. He is no Bruce Brown. I think he tries to hard. Give up the mic and just shoot.",1263081600,,440,4.127906976744186
