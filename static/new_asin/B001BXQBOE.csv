8285263,5,B001BXQBOE,There is a ton of very useful techniques in this video. Very detail explanations with both a live partner and then a dummy. Well worth the money!,1440892800,2,145,4.407407407407407
8285264,4,B001BXQBOE,Not to bad. Some good stuff. Some iffy stuff. My dummy still wins every time. I am improving and one day I will beat his ass good,1377820800,4,129,3.814814814814815
8285265,5,B001BXQBOE,"First: I don't leave reviews a lot but, I had to leave one for this great dvd set. I teach Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do which utilizes multiple strikes, so you do not have to be a strong person to do it. Nonetheless, what I appreciate so much about these 2 dvds is the incredible strenthening workout it provides while instructing on how to remedy fighting issues. The makers should have also indicated the awesome workout it provides on their cover. This is indispensible.",1352505600,2,469,4.595238095238095
8285266,4,B001BXQBOE,"This will be short and simple. I've always been a fan of Hatmaker's stuff. He's knowledgeable, engaging and thorough. The material is laid out, perhaps not necessarily in what I would call logical order, but laid out in manner that is easy to pickup. The production quality is simple and straightforward, as is the material. I personally love tossing my grappling dummeh around, and Silent Partner profoundly supplemented my limited knowledge on the subject. I also learned several wrestling terms and Hatmaker indicated a variety of nuances I'd never even thought about when throwing. He makes it clear that this material isn't conditioning for suplexing/backcasting, that's another DVD, and he warns against attempting them until you have those principles mastered. But to wrap it up, good solid DVD. Enough throws and tosses to keep things interesting, but not enough to overwhelm. Highly recommended.",1335484800,3,904,5.328671328671328
8285267,5,B001BXQBOE,"A great DVD for anyone who wants to learn to use a throwing/training dummy for any kind of sport.

It is easy to follow and very simple.

Great resource!",1334102400,2,153,4.241379310344827
