8573281,4,B00BSEQQ4Q,"This is a great video for teaching/coaching to young children (8-12 years old) the fundamentals of soccer (football).  Great tips on passing, turning with the ball, 1 v. 1 feints and moves and heading.  Good solid teaching and principles on which to further build as the player gets older.  I recommend this DVD to coaches of young players.",1393113600,,340,4.827586206896552
