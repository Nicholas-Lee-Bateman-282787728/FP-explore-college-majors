6729311,4,B00O8RSFOE,"I would give it 3 and 3/4 stars if I could because I like fractions. Overall it isn't anything to write home about... EXCEPT for Allison Williams! I thought she was amazing and brought such an awesome exuberance to a role I never particularly liked before. Well I'll eat my hat if she didn't make me not just like it but love it. Yes they should have tried to get Tim Curry or someone more Hammy and overly emotive as Captain Hook, and I won't say that didn't bother me.... But it was worth it for Ms. Williams as Peter. And Smee was also great. Rest of cast was good and the production was very quirky but it grew on me and became charming.",1417651200,11,641,4.17741935483871
6729312,5,B00O8RSFOE,"Loved it! Well-done and superb voices! Allison Williams was believable; Christopher Walken was not the best Hook I've ever seen, but otherwise, it was great!",1417651200,4,157,5.32
6729313,1,B00O8RSFOE,"I did not buy this because I saw it tonight on the television. This is probably the worst version of the play ever! The characters were dead.  Even  Walken, who I really like, seemed to be too tired to move or put himself into the part.  Much better is the 1960 version with Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard.  This can be viewed free on YouTube.",1417651200,15,343,4.230769230769231

6729315,1,B00O8RSFOE,"I am sorry to say but I am not at all impressed. As a matter of fact, I have tried really hard but could not sit through the whole live presentation. I was really looking forward to this but here is what I did not like.

For starters the videographers were a bit messy. I am fine with some camera shake because this is live but there was way to much. It was only like they can get the framing right on the ground but when special effects like flying came into play, the scene was a mess.

Captain hook was terrible. I am sorry but he looked drugged or something. There was little to no emotion in his voice. It looked like they took someone off the streets and is a first timer. I needed to see the emotion and feelings of anger and rage. All was missing.

I could go on but I think this is reason enough not to like this live presentation. I was not a fan. It was torture sitting though it this long. There are much better versions to see.",1417651200,14,940,4.043010752688172
6729316,4,B00O8RSFOE,"I already have the 2000 version with Cathy Rigby, I put in my order for this version before it aired, but I miss the one I saw when I was little with Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard. Maybe this is a project for Shout Factory to tackle? Anyway, having seen it now (the present form of this review is a morning-after revision), I found myself wondering why I heard so many of the American cast slightly imitating British accents in the songs. The only one who didn't fall into that trap was Chris Walken as Captain Hook. The last time that social phenomenon happened was back during rock's British Invasion when every kid with a guitar tried to talk like Paul McCartney. And I noticed use of the term ""fairy dust"" the way the show was written, whereas Sunday night's ""Once Upon a Time"" went all PC and used ""pixie dust"" in their scenes involving Peter Pan. And contrary to the fact that this was at least partly aimed at a very young market, it was LONG--took up the usual 2:30 or so of a 3-hour broadcast slot. I mean, little kids get bo-oo-ored. And not only that--Indian leader Tiger Lily is a bona fide hottie.",1417651200,11,1111,4.398058252427185

6729324,1,B00O8RSFOE,"The changes to ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" are the only reason to see this version. The argument was the song was racist because the words have no meaning, but still Jarod Tate applied meaning to the words when writing the new lyrics "" It [supposedly] means danger or come here or something like that"" I personally thought ""Help"" might be a better word since they decided to use only one word.  A better argument would be that the words in ""Ugg-A-Wuug"" conjured up negative  images of themselves in the minds of Native Americans. They also use ""Hickory Dickory Dock"" in the song; Hickory comes from the Native American word pawcohiccora. Dickory Dock is still meaningless nonsense, which is the reason why they changed the lyrics in the first place.  It makes me angry that they put such emphasis on using Native American words, but then decided to go with the childish sounding one.  Being that they chose a word that means ""Danger"" there are many possibilities for Choreography none of which they use.  The Choreography, another form of langue, is meaningless. The Jerome Robbins Choreography for ""Ugg-A-Wugg"" you can at least try to infer meaning from, you should try it sometime. Though in the ""Sexy Indian"" trope and the whole exercise is pointless. The Soundtrack is on Prime Music I'd recommend the Soundtrack instead.",1479254400,,1310,4.909502262443439

6729337,1,B00O8RSFOE,"Why does this have 4-stars? This was not good. At all. Given, it was the first attempt at such a thing in many many years and I commend them for that, but the bland performance  by Christopher Walken could have been topped by anyone from any community theater across the country with a little experience. Dreary singing. What is supposed to be a fantastical adventure that has enlightened and stirred excitement in children for decades, most likely sent any kid watching off to play with something else, put them to sleep or off to watch a different version of the story.

This joyless production of Peter Pan was a flop and has no business with 4-stars. My community theater is getting ready to perform Peter Pan as well and I have no doubt it will capture the joy and imagination that a play of this sort should capture.",1454371200,,822,4.547297297297297

6729342,2,B00O8RSFOE,"There will never ever be any version of ""Peter Pan"" better than Mary Martin's, but after initially not liking it, I watched it again and it's not that bad. It updates the Mary Martin version graphically from the primitive color of the old NBC version, though it adds some unnecessary new songs to the mix. The charm of the story is still there. Allison Williams can't beat Mary Martin. No one ever could. But if this is the way the current generation gets the story, then so be it.",1447718400,,481,4.415730337078652

A lot of people have complained about Peter being played by a woman, this strikes me as sour grapes. In fact a lot of the reviews take this kind of direction. Forget them and enjoy yourself.

6729357,2,B00O8RSFOE,"I have long loved the Disney animated version of Peter Pan, and even the live action version from a few years back was fun.  (At least I thought so, anyway.)  However, the one time I saw the Mary Martin version, I was less than impressed.  That was almost enough to get me to skip last weeks showing of Peter Pan Live!, but I decided to give it a try.  I should have skipped it.

This is a musical retelling of the story of Peter Pan, and anyone who is familiar with the story will know what happens here.  Peter (Allison Williams) is the boy who won't grow up, and hes found this is possible in Neverland, a land filled with pirates, Indians, mermaids, and adventure.  He has found the window of the Darling family and loves listening to the stories Wendy (Taylor Louderman) tells her brothers John (Jake Lucas) and Michael (John Allyn).  When they meet Peter, he teaches them all to fly and takes them to Neverland.  However, his enemy Captain Hook (Christopher Walken) has just returned to the island with plans to get his revenge.  Will Wendy be safe?  Will Peter prevail?

Once again, this is an all new, live performance of a classic musical designed to be broadcast on one night only.  The sets were wonderful and were a huge visual draw.  In addition to looking great, they allowed for the song and dance numbers and still left room for the camera to capture it all.  Pretty impressive.

And the story itself is still good.  Despite my complaints to come, I cant fault that in the slightest.  In fact, Peter is slightly less self-absorbed than he is in other versions of the story, so that is a definite plus.

So where does this version fail?  Part of it is the music.  There were two songs I liked, Im Flying and I Wont Grow Up.  The rest of them were pretty bad and boring.  They didn't make me want to sing along.  The dancing was more impressive, and it helped make the songs more bearable, but it could only do so much.

While the acting was mostly good, another huge flaw was Christopher Walken as Captain Hook.  To me, he looked like he was bored with the entire thing from start to finish.  Im not saying that Hook has to be over the top, but he needs some life and menace to him.  Any scene he was in was flat.  No, he wasn't as bad as Carrie Underwood last year, but it was certainly close.

Just like last year, the performances seemed a little nervous and rushed at the beginning, but as the cast got over their nerves, things smoothed out.  Im not going to fault them there at all.  In keeping with tradition, a woman played Peter Pan, and Allison Williams was great as the boy who won't grow up.  She even made the part where she had to break the fourth wall work, something that Mary Martin certainly didn't do.  In a tweak of tradition, Christian Borle played both Mr. Darling and Smee (instead of Hook).  Honestly, if I hadnt known, I wouldnt have guessed.  The two characters looked and acted so different.  He was great.  And Taylor Louderman was fantastic in what can be the thankless role of Wendy, breathing life into the character.

Some people complained about seeing the wires when the characters were flying.  That didn't bother me in the slightest.  Its a staple of Broadway productions, and that is essentially what this is.  Even in the old version, you could see those wires, and I found this charming to a certain extent.  Besides, how were they supposed to cover them?

There is one more thing I have to take this production to task for, however  the crocodile.  No, I didn't expect them to have a real one on stage with the actors.  But who came up with that blue monstrosity?  No, Im not kidding, it was blue.  And it was very robotic in its movements.  It was completely laughable and detracted as well.

As you can imagine, I won't be rushing back to watch Peter Pan Live! again.  Instead, Ill stick with the ones I already have when I want to visit Neverland.",1434844800,,3905,4.420534458509142

Along with a drunk Christopher Walken that looks like a drag queen and a Peter Pan that looks totally like a girl. They don't even try to hide the strings that make them fly and the fight scenes are hilariously horrible. It hurts my feelings to think Mary Martin may have seen this in heaven! Ugh! Rewind and don't try again! Don't be like Disney and re-do everything over and over and over! STOP! ENOUGH! This was awful at it's best.

I do think that Christopher Walken was a lousy Captain Hook. In all fairness-- I don't think his role was written very well . Somehow, a dancing Captain Hook who doesn't seem to care whether he walks the plank or not, is just not believable. Allison Williams was really good  as Peter Pan and has a beautiful voice.

Now that I have three little kids, I hoped they would love the new version as much as I loved the old one, but didn't think they would.  I was totally wrong.  They LOVE this version.  We have it saved on our DVR and they've watched it nearly every day.  I am buying the DVD so they can watch it in the car.  They know all the songs and sing along.

6729409,2,B00O8RSFOE,"I looked forward to this production with great anticipation since I have always loved this musical staging of Barrie's great work. I ended up forcing myself to watch this production to the bitter end and was sorely disappointed.  None of the blame goes to Allison Williams who put in a rather satisfactory performance as Peter.  So did Taylor Louderman as Wendy.  There were several other cast members that put in a great performances as well. However, where was Captain Hook?  I missed him in this production.  It was sad that such a fine actor as Christopher Walken put in such a weak performance.  Christian Borle's reinterpretation of Smee just didn't work. To boot, the additional songs and choreography did nothing but drag down a production that was already too long, overdone and laborious looking; one big ""over-achieving"" effort. The only surprising exception was the addition of Peter's song, ""When I Went Home"".  It did introduce a poignant piece from the book by Barrie that is not seen in other productions.  Other reviewers have already criticized the Neverland set and the Lost Boys costumes, neither of which reflects the book or original play. Neverland had it's beauty but it also had it's dark side which was not communicated here. Reading other reviews, I understand that a fairly large viewing audience enjoyed this production. For those that did not, I recommend obtaining a DVD copy of ""Cathy Rigby is Peter Pan"" with Paul Schoeffler who is as wonderful Captain Hook as ever could be; evil, funny and just human enough that we love to hate him. It's very tight production with no boring stretches. Of course nobody flies like Cathy Rigby.  All of the performers are at the top of their game in regards to the singing and dancing. If you haven't seen this superior stage production, you're in for a real treat! This staging made many improvements on the beloved Mary Martin version which was limited by the technology of the day. Order it today and see for yourself.",1421193600,,1989,4.8609467455621305

6729417,1,B00O8RSFOE,"I am honestly confused by the number of good reviews for this.  As an other reviewer stated, I have seen amateur productions that are better than this.  (even the flying wasn't too spectacular - check out Cathy Rigby for some great flying!) Yes, the sets are amazing, they did find a good alternative for the ugg-a-wug song but the acting and story are a DISASTER.
1) As much as she raved about Peter Pan - I don't think she has ever watched a previous version let alone read the book where Peter is an Arrogant if Charismatic character who loves nothing more than a fight. She was very much a girl - a very tall girl - and there was nothing boyish or impish about her performance.
2) Captain Hook - the book describes the Pirates as Hooks dogs and they acted as such and he treated them so - even with PETA influence - we all know that to be treated like a dog is a vicious thing.  Hook was kind and cozy with nothing terrible or threatening about him,  Before watching this, my 4 and 2 year old had been on a peter pan kick.  We watched Mary Martin, Cathy Rigby, Disney, and a Ballet production.  Of Captian Hook, my daughter said - He's not scary - he doesn't shout very much.  Please note that in the Ballet - where hook doesn't talk  - he was still a scary and intimidating individual - a Pirate to turn the blood cold - just as he should be.
3) Smee and the father - I was ready to turn it off after just the bland and emotionless performance of the father at the start - the book describes his entrance as a tornado.  i would say that he didn't even achieve an entrance of dust devil.  Even as Smee - he failed to redeem himself.
As for the digital effects of fairy dust and Tinkerbell - I think that more magic is conveyed from the older productions just using light and glitter, Though my children do prefer that Cathy Rigby can hold Tink in her hands when she is sick.

When you see a play made into a movie - it should make you think wow - that would be neat to see a live performance! This production was long, slowly paced, and badly executed.  I would not want to see it.  Mary martin and Cathy Rigby? - yes - the ballet?  Yes.  They were full of enchantment and drama - a quick clip to Neverland and back again.",1420243200,2,2226,4.156177156177156
6729418,5,B00O8RSFOE,"The varies sets are well designed. Even the addition of some new songs to the score are very well done. As for the people who don't like Capt. Hook's singing voice what else do you expect. In the book it says Capt. Hook is so fond of smoking cigars that he fashioned a cigar holder that could hold two cigars at once. So seriously how good of singing voice could he actually have. It was also a relief to see that Tiger Lily was cast correctly instead of the blond hair, fair skinned version in the Mary Martin as Peter Pan.",1420156800,,524,4.198019801980198

However I admit that I became a little disappointed to find out it would be Peter Pan, for the only reason that it has been done before for television. Also I personally always felt that right after the Darling children fly out the window to Neverland the story itself falls flat. But how wrong was I, to think I was not going to enjoy this presentation.
A big applause must go to the producers for revising the script, and the additions of new songs. The choreography was amazing and I would simply describe this presentation as Broadway at its best.
The lavish sets, performances were simply a thrill, and this DVD is simply a must for those who enjoy Musical Theatre.
Along with my family we watched this performance a number of times during the holidays and can't have enough of this brilliant presentation. A big thank you to NBC and the producers for bringing these productions to our screens during the Christmas holidays. They are such a treat!

The production is static (no up or downs) and awkward.  You would do your own editing in the theatre, you can't do that on tv.  Add to that the  constant interruption for commercials (in this DVD the awakward ""spaces"" where the commercials would have been and it looks like awkward editing.  I'm glad the children in our family got an introduction to this musical and the wonderful acting of the Ol' Captain Hook (Walkin is brilliant in his over the top ""camp"" rendition of the character)....but it really isn't very good.

I personally think that the cast, etc. did a wonderful job in this. Thank you for making it! To give a reason for younger generations to smile is outstanding. I love the props, etc. They had to have been fun to make. My father had the role of hook here in Savannah. Musicals like Peter Pan helped me as I have Epilepsy and later had brain surgery to help it. I have been in on-stage musicals but mainly just chorus roles. After surgery, I woke up with my left side temp. paralyzed. When Peter sings about  wiggling his fingers and toes, I have to be honest. It gets me every time. I still don't have as much confidence as I once did, but I learned at a young age, the show must go on! Im now working on fundraising to help save the dolphins for The Foundation for Antarctic Research, Inc. Thats my way of flying, because as corny as it sounds only helping others can make me crow.  Thank you for giving others a reason to smile. I still long for my dream of theatre to come true, but I don't know if its physically possible for me now. It gives me great joy to see others being able to experience rehearsals, and really what becomes family. I commend each of you. Thank you for having the courage to put this on and for sharing it. The casting was wonderful and great voices. Outstanding job!

With all due respect to Rigby as well as Mary Martin and Sandy Duncan,  both of whom I have seen in short clips only, Allison Williams nailed it as far as I am concerned.  I only wish she would do it sometime with a touring company.  The ""Walkenese"" version of Hook was certainly different; away from the norm, but very entertaining.",1419120000,,416,4.227848101265823
6729435,5,B00O8RSFOE,"This was the best Peter Pan I have seen since Mary Martin.  I think the critical reviewers don't know much about singing, acting, athletic performance and all the hard work that went into this.  Bravo to all of the cast and crew!  I throughly enjoyed  and appreciated this magnificent performance!",1418860800,2,297,4.88
6729436,4,B00O8RSFOE,"For me, you can't beat a live production; moreover, I'm old enough to remember and have enjoyed the Mary Martin TV production, and these two are different but the spirit's the same, and here, you get great sets, fun dance numbers and, I think, overall good family entertainment.

There's a lot of work put into this show, as can be seen with the included ""Making Of"" featurette(I love those!).  We really liked the Sound of Music(SOM) last year, and the same NBC group orchestrated this one.  I favor SOM much more than Peter.  The music's better, but here they do offer some very good dancing scenes, neat imaginative sets and terrific stage special effects.

The actors do a super job- especially Allison WIlliams as Peter.  She becomes totally boyish, self-centered and magical in her role.  Watching her in real life, discuss and rehearse the role, she's beautiful, a talented singer and fearless- especially- with all those wire scenes. Fun Christian Borle returns from last year's SOM.

Of course, then there's Christopher Walken... maybe terribly miscast... but you got to love him(or hate him, I guess).  Christopher Walken is Christopher Walken: A little bit of that accent, a little bit of tongue in cheek acting and always, always, a little soft shoe.  He makes me laugh.  He's in his 70's doing his thing, take him or leave him.  In his bio, he say he loves doing comedy, harder to do, even though he's remembered for those dramatic if not creepy roles.

OK, looking at the some of the negative comments: the kids are too old, they shouldn't be sleeping in the same room, their clothes are too neat and clean, their treehouse too nice, Christopher Walken ""looks like Fu Manchu""(Hmm, yeah, I guess he does.) and so forth... come on, this is a fantasy.  There are a lot of talented people busting their rear ends to put all aspects of this show together including some really good child actors.  It may not be the way we remember it or imagine, exactly, the way we might like it to be, but still, what an eyeful of spontaneous showmanship and creativity.

We look forward to, hopefully, NBC returning next year with another Live show!",1418860800,,2144,4.738544474393531
6729437,2,B00O8RSFOE,"The production wasn't as bad as most are saying here.  It was light years ahead of the disaster Carrie Underwood was last year in SOM.  Casting was decent, I was pleasantly surprised by Allison Williams.  Regardless she is a huge step up from underwood last year.  Walken was alright.  His hook worked.  Choreography was enjoyable (I believe it was done by Ashman).  The biggest problems were technical: lazy mic tape, poorly planned wide shots and brief other issues with sound or video.  The casting of the lost boys may have been the worst part.  By ""I won't grow up"" they must have meant ""I grew up a couple decades ago and am about to go grey.""

Aside from that: are we going back in time?  Seriously, why would ANYONE release just a DVD!?  DVD is far inferior to BD and there is no reason to only release media now in an obsolete medium.  That right tere cost this review 2 of the 3 stars I cut.",1418860800,2,901,4.355421686746988

6729439,5,B00O8RSFOE,"Like many who viewed this live telecast, I have been a lifelong fan of Peter Pan.  Dressing up as him from as far ago as I can remember, there's never been a moment in my life where Peter Pan hasn't been at the top.  That being said, I was very defensive of the Cathy Rigby version of Peter Pan's musical.  The TV special had all of the right people in the roles and just connected something magical.  This version not only rivals that, but arguably becomes something better.  Adding the songs Pretend and When I Went Home add an emotion to the Peter/Wendy relationship.  Christopher Walken did such a great job as Captain Hook.  The only part of his I didn't like was the final swordfight.

Allison Williams does a beyond amazing job as Peter.  I didn't know she could sing! The actors playing the Darling Children were all so amazing.  Smee/Mr Darling is probably my favorite.  People love to hate on this and after watching this a few times (and currently listening to the soundtrack whilst writing this) I can't think of a bad thing to say.",1418774400,3,1044,4.5

Hook is a man who lives his life to destroy Peter Pan and Walken showed no passion in even that. The casting was just horrible. The other part that was horrible was the tree house, lost boys and clothing. The tree house was amazing. Something that in the real world would cost a ton to make look that way. How could the lost boys create something so amazing. THE LOST BOYS ... more like lost teenagers about to become adults. there was no age range. AND THE CLOTHES were all fancy and nicely taken care of. THEY LIVE IN THE WOODS. They are not rich kids. Peter Pan's clothes were also horrible. They were shiney and nice and all wrong. The only reason I bought this movie was because my five year old loved it because Peter Pan is her world.

Wendy is much too old to be sharing a bedroom with her younger brothers, and the lost boys are more like the New York Gay Men's Chorus (who are absolutely wonderful!), but this isn't the place for them.

And while Ms. Williams was not the best Peter I've ever seen she certainly wasn't the worst. The only criticism I could make would be for her to have been a bit more playful. Sadly, the weakest part for me was Christopher Walken. And that is only because his performance was uneven. He couldn't seem to decide if he was himself in Captain Hook's costume or if he really wanted to BE Captain Hook. So he was a strange mixture of both. However, his numbers were still entertaining and left a smile on my face. Overall, it is an excellent live musical theater event and I think all involved should be very proud!

He literally walked through the production, seemingly bored and tired. The big sword fight at the end was in slow motion. The ""Lost Boys"" were more like lost 20-somethings.

Allison Williams can sing, but physically is too lanky and tall for the part and can't deliver her lines with any wonder, and, as is Walken, she's not flamboyant enough to raise it to another level. It's as if Julie Andrews is doing it as Mary Poppins. And Wendy is too large and grown-up looking, otherwise her acting, singing is fine. And what's up with the ""Lost FRAT Boys"" in school clothes??? They're way too old. I doubt any dad would adopt them with a teenage daughter in the house. The only kid-like acting was by John and Michael, because they were kids. The musical numbers were just okay, however, lacked the energy you'd see in a stage play. Overall, a boring, flat rendition.

Allison Williams (Actor), Christopher Walken (Actor), Glenn Weiss
I liked it a lot, but :
Christopher Walken was passed it for this. He looked fragile and barely able to move. His makeup was just awful! He looked like a kabuki who had also been drained of life by vampires and then drugged. the tight head band was not doing him any favors either. Where was the Big full wig ? He trough out lines like used kleenex! Lines that Cyril Richard gave such character to, just thrown away.
Allison Williams as Peter was very good! The Indians were great! Tiger Lilly was very well done. The sets were great!",1417824000,2,616,4.508928571428571
6729457,5,B00O8RSFOE,"There doesn't seem to be much love or appreciation for live Broadway style work on here! I watched the show live when it aired. Having grown up with watching Mary Martin's version on VHS playing over and over and having the whole thing memorized, I had high hopes that this would be a classic my daughter (who is only 16 months right now) could grow up watching with me. I was not disapointed.

Did it have faults? Of course! It was LIVE. I would have never guessed it were live though. The camera angles and transitions were near flawless.

Set:
The set was just absolutely beautiful. I rewatched my DVR recording the day after the premiere with my daughter and she was fascinated during the Neverland parts. The gorgeous colors and creative designs were so beautiful. The rose tree tops were just so gorgeous! But my favorite sort of scenery was the appearance of the mermaids during the added rowboat scene. The were gorgeous and their tails flipping in the background really lit up that scene.

The music:
Even the music performed live. Is Allison Williams the next big thing singer? No. But she was perfect for Pan's role. Her voice didn't have too much flair and wasn't show offey but it was on point and emotional. Wendy's voice and her mother's were definitely the best. Walken didn't really do much singing- more sing-songey Walken voicing the lines but I kind of feel like he gets a pass because he is THE Christopher Walken and the guy is like 71.

The dancing:
Really well choreographed! I saw very few mess ups and everything flowed well together. I especially enjoyed seeing the Lost Boys ""play"" dance and when Tiger Lily's Native Americans joined the dance. It was so smooth and fun.

The acting:
Wendy probably killed it most of all. She was incredible and emotional and really made you feel what it's like to be in your teens and swooning over someone who's just not that into you. Williams as Peter Pan did an incredible job too. I felt really excited for her having known she has wanted to be Peter Pan her whole life. Critics panned the part where she broke the 4th wall to get the children in the audience to clap to bring Tink back to life, but I grew up with the Mary Martin version and she too did the exact thing. Is it weird as an adult watching? Yes. But as a child I remember getting so pumped for that part and clapping to save Tinkerbell every time. People, it's a fairy tale. Yes, it's cheesy at times but it was written about a hundred years ago and it's amazing how much it still translates and relates.

The changes:
I read somewhere that the song Wendy sang in the boat was added and a solo by Pan removed during that part. I thought it was perfect for that moment. You really get a glimpse into her longing for Peter, her wanting to be attached to him but wondering if he really cares. You see the beauty of Neverland through her eyes and her excitement of everything around her (and MERMAIDS!!).
Also, the Ugg-a-Wugg number was updated, which was really about time. I am not of Native American descent but can obviously see how that nonsense song would be offensive. Also, the original casting of a pale white, platinum blonde girl as Tiger Lily. I read an article about how for this special, NBC really sought out and cast an actress of Native American descent (she was part Cherokee) and how in order to update the song, they worked with the daughter of one of the original songwriters and a composer who is a member of Chickasaw Nation to really make the song more authentic. It's hard knowing your classic that you've grown up with is changed but for those reasons, it's absolutely allowed and accepted and welcomed. One of the original actresses said in an article she didn't want to watch and was angry about that song change because PC didn't exist back then. Well, yeah, racism was more blatant. At least companies are trying to be less offensive now.

Technology:
I LOVED that they added some digital touches with Tinkerbell and with Peter's shadow in the first number. Tinkerbell, rather than being a star shaped flashlight in Mary Martin's era became a digital glow - not obvious at all but much more effective as it could move more quickly. And the people in charge were amazing at having her change spot from camera angle to camera angle. So smooth. Also, Peter's shadow after it was reattached was computer animated on the walls. GREAT touch! It danced along side Peter Pan and they bowed to each other and the effect was perfect and captivating.
Wires.....YES, you can see them. No, they aren't invisible. Come on, people. Use some imagination.

Overall, the movie was fantastic! If I didn't have a daughter I would probably not purchase the soundtrack but we are a musical family and I'm sure she'll love listening to the songs over and over like I did when I was little. I really look forward to watching the movie with her when she understands and can sit still a little longer. I was actually pretty amazed she watched as much as she did with me. The only thing that she sits that long for currently is Frozen, so hurray for a new update!

Obviously, Broadway/Live style isn't for everyone, but I honestly think nowadays with all our quick camera angles and changes we're super spoiled and expect way too much. I can't believe how seamlessly the camera angles changed and moved. The whole cast and crew did a fantastic job and should feel incredibly proud of their accomplishments.

I am glad it is not perfect...it is theatre NOT an edited production, and thus I felt it was filled with a joy that the actors actually seemed to be feeling while in their performances.  They enjoyed it and it showed!  The music and voices were wonderful.  I was very impressed with Ms Williams.  And Mr Walken is an entity unto himself and let some of his quirkiness and personality shine in his performance.

6729463,2,B00O8RSFOE,"There were just too many problems with this show to make it entertaining.

Allison Williams was okay, but you never really buy into her as Peter Pan. She can sing. She can dance. She did everything right. But at the end of the day she just didn't come off as Peter Pan. She was like a new character you'd never seen before. (Perhaps because she was trying to be the original 1904 mildly creepy Peter Pan who wanted Wendy to be his mother instead of the more updated Peter Pan we've come to know and love who sees Wendy as a childhood playmate.)

And there exists no bigger Christopher Walken fan than me. But there isn't enough cowbell in the world to save a performance where he forgot many of his lines.

I couldn't figure out why the Lost Boys were dressed in school uniforms either. Isn't the point of being a lost boy that you don't have to go to school and dress nice?

And Tinkerbelle is supposed to be a full character with dialog and emotions. In this production she was a laser pointer.

Even with these issues, the production could have been okay if the story was told better. (If I get to watch Christopher Walken dance a tango while dressed as a pirate, I'll overlook a lot of little things) It was visually appealing but it was just boring. Aside from a song and dance routine every 20 minutes or so it was a painfully slow story that took forever to progress. I thought the opening scene with the kids going to bed was never going to end. It's not even critical to the flow of the story...so get to the point. The kids go to bed, Peter Pan shows up and takes them out the window to Neverland. That should take 5 minutes at the most, not 40.

And having characters using 1904 British dialog from the original source material just slowed it down even further. I'm all for an early 20th Century British setting, but update the dialog a tad so your 2014 America audience can easily follow it. And maybe take out all the references to killing people and fairies that want to get Wendy killed with an arrow for your modern audience. Just a suggestion. Even as far back as 1953, Walt Disney understood that he needed to update the story to make it play well with his intended audience, and at that time the source material was only 49 years old.

Also the scene where Peter Pan broke the 4th wall and talks to the audience to try to get the children watching to clap to save Tinkerbelle's life was wildly out of place. If that was a running theme to engage the audience throughout the show, that's one thing. But doing that just 1 time was completely disjointed and felt odd. Not to mention Peter Pan was suddenly appealing to all the children in the audience....at about 10:25 PM Eastern Time. Like....really? Even in Central Time that's well past the bedtime of kids young enough to enjoy that sort of thing.

Ultimately there was no single thing in this production that was so awful that it totally ruined the show. But when you add up all the little things you get a painfully slow story (It was three hours long. You were actually happy when the commercials gave you a break at times) that was just boring. It was jut not entertaining. I was hoping for at least a show I could DVR and show to my toddler (who LOVES singing and dancing) but with every song and dance number being separated by 20-30 minutes of dry dialog even my kid bailed on this when I have it a shot with her the next morning. So its' slow and boring no matter who the audience is. There's just no saving that.

Props to NBC for trying something uncommon though. You never advance without trying things.",1417737600,11,3585,4.378947368421053

6729466,4,B00O8RSFOE,"After what I considered a really big disaster, last years NBCs Live Broadcast of The Sound Of Music  it was a refreshing change to see this years live broadcast of a re-adapted version of the classic J.M. Barrie story Peter Pan. With a teleplay written by Irene Mecchi, original lyrics by Carolyn Leigh, (additional lyrics added by Betty Comden and Adolph Green), music by Morris (Moose) Charlap (additional music added by Jule Styne) and the entire live production directed for TV by Glenn Weiss (stage direction by Rob Ashford)  this was a fun treat of a classic story and wonderful musical play  done live.

Allison Williams is Peter Pan and she does an amazing job acting as the boy who never grew up. She was sharp and innocent and had the perfect attitude for a boy who still had so much to learn  and he learned it the hard way. Allison also had a wonderful voice and gave it her all with each song and her rendition of Im Flying was so thrilling to watch..

Christopher Walkin is Captain Hook. Now I must say his performance is unique, as he always is, but he seemed to really enjoy the dancing a lot. His Hook is somewhat tame and  little weak, but his attitude was that to cause a nice contrast for Peter. Now his singing, well, lets just focus on the whimsical Hook he was trying to portray. His song Vengeance was a hoot to watch for the dancing alone.

Another wonderful voice and spot-on performance is coming from Taylor Louderman playing Wendy Darling. Her innocence as the older of the Darling children while being strong and honest to the Lost Boys makes her performance very charming and often heartwarming. He songs Only Pretend and Distant Melody were extremely touching and character driven in her performance.

Christian Borle does a duel role both as Mr. Darling and Hooks right-hand man Smee. His Mr. Darling is regal and somewhat pushy as a father of three kids, but his Smee was fun-loving and a very snarky and stooge-like which created some very funny moments for Walkin and himself.

Kelli OHara plays Mrs. Darling and her charm and warmth as a mother really shines in this production. Not to mention her wonderful singing ability with her song Tender Shepard was extremely enjoyable to hear and watch.

Alanna Saunders plays the strong leader Tiger Lilly and gives the show a nice well rounding to a very talented cast. Shes quite the dancer too.

The Darling Boys were perfectly cast with Jake Lucas and John darling and John Allyn as Michael Darling. Even the group that was the gymnastic Lost Boys, The muscular Indians, The overbearing Pirates and even a live action crocodile were all part of a wonderful ensemble that was all perfectly choreographed by Rob Ashford.

Oh, and the Narrator as well as the older Wendy Darling was played by Minnie Driver. Her voice and tone were perfect to guide the audience throughout the entire 3 hour production. And, Yes, she asked the audience  by breaking the 4th wall, to help save Tink  a wonderful glowing fairy that is a major character through out!

Technically the show has some wonderful flying rigging, lighting design and set-change sequences where the sets just opened up and came to life. It was amazing to watch the technical engineering that must have had to happen to make it all work. The costumes and scenic designs were colorful and full of a childlike charm. Overall, NBC Live Broadcast of Peter Pan was thoroughly enjoyable  with a few weak points that don't overwhelm the production  (remember it is a childrens play)  it is certainly fun for the whole family.

8682611,3,B00O8RSFOE,"First, in the interest of full disclosure, I love the musical!  (but this is my least favorite version)  I always have, since I first watched the original Mary Martin version on NBC as a kid in the 1960s, to later sharing A&Es Cathy Rigby version with my daughter in the 2000s.  And Ive been a life-long fan of the show, wearing out the vinyl soundtrack album, and eventually meeting Miss Martin herself.  So it was with great excitement in 2014 that I learned NBC planned to revive the production and present it again as a Live broadcast. Having watched this new production Live, and again upon repeated viewing on DVD, I have Good News and Bad News.

The Good News:  This is perhaps the greatest, most ambitious, and most spectacularly mounted production ever.  Strictly in terms of production value, it unquestionably succeeds in smashing the proscenium and bringing the viewer literally into the story with 360-degree sets, flying Steadicams, and a brilliant reimagining of Neverland.  From the very first moment, we are not on a Broadway stage, but in a childs minds eye, flying over a breathtaking miniature of London, complete with LED lights and fog, which later also serves as the floor under Peter and the childrens big Flying scene.  As we (the camera) fly into the Darling household window, we are presented for the first time with the Nursery in the round.  Throughout the scene, the camera spins around the Darling parents, and then around Wendy and Peter, even taking us out into the corridor and back for a truly immersive experience.

This is clearly to be a Peter Pan like no other.  And rightfully so  the Martin and Rigby versions were essentially video scrapbooks of their respective hit Broadway shows.  Rigbys especially, since it was taped before a live theater audience, thus giving us the closest simulation of seeing the performance in person.  Even in our living room, we literally gasped (along with the theatergoers) when Rigby flies out over the audience during the curtain call.

And this newest Peter Pan  lets call it the Williams version  is chock full of stunning innovations.  Unlike the previous two, it makes no pretense of being a stage show.  Instead, it uses all the 21st Century technology it can muster to create nothing less than a motion picture shot all in one (and only one) continuous take.  There are computer-controlled flying rigs, digitally projected dancing shadows, and even a first-ever CGI Tinkerbell.

Beyond the Nursery, every other set is also stunning and innovative.  The Neverland floor is a huge treasure map with compass points and Neverland spelled out. The forest trees are gigantic bouquets of roses.  The Lost Boys underground hideout is entered via a sliding board instead of a fire pole, and the pirate ship is made to rock back and forth through camera trickery, throwing the crew left and right a la Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. Oh, and a real sheepdog as Nana  a courageous choice for live television!

Visually, its like seeing the story told for the first time, and I treasure this version for those reasons.

Now for the Bad News:  I can forgive technical flubs (of which I counted only two)   after all, this is live television.  In fact, theres only one unforgivable thing wrong with this show, but its a biggie  Casting.  And the casting mistakes are so egregious that they effectively sabotage the whole broadcast. To be fair, every member of the talented supporting cast is just fine, and there are some delightful standouts, such as Kelli OHara as Mrs. Darling, Christian Borle as both Mr. Darling and Smee, and especially Taylor Louderman as Wendy.

Where the casting decisions fall flat is in the two leads, Allison Williams as Pan and Christopher Walken as Hook.  I feel badly saying this about Allison, because in a way, I know the family.  I worked directly with her dad, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams back when he was a reporter in Washington DC around the time that Allison was just a little girl.  It was no doubt a huge thrill for the Williams family for her to be chosen to play the lead, and a wonderful boost to her already successful acting career.  She is now tall and willowy, beautiful and charming, and enormously talented.  She does her absolute best in what she calls the role of a lifetime, but she is simply wrong for the part.  Thats not her fault, its a casting mistake.

You see, theres a reason that women have traditionally been cast as Peter, including Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan in the Broadway revival of 1980, and Cathy Rigby in 1998, harking all the way back to J.M. Barries own 1904 staging.  Thats because a carefully chosen petite sprightly woman could better pass for a middle-school aged boy, and until now has worked well in every case.  But Allison is neither petite nor elf-like.  She simply doesnt look the part.  To her credit, she totally nails the English accent, and has a lovely voice especially for ballads, but seems unable to hold the sustained notes in power songs like Flying and I Gotta Crow.

Worst of all (blame either the director or her flying coach), Allison doesnt look likes shes flying, she looks like shes being flown.  Martin, Duncan, and Rigby have all said how difficult it is to make the flying look convincing.  But instead of outreaching arms, Allisons are clenched down by her side as if waiting for the rig to lift her up. She doesnt anticipate and bend with her legs to appear to push off the floor, she simply rises like a ghost.  Of course Martin and Rigby had each been practicing the show for years before their respective telecasts.  Allisons rehearsals were only for a few weeks, but a simple screening of either earlier broadcast would have revealed the technique.

And then theres Christopher Walken as Hook.  Ive been a big fan of Walkens ever since he co-starred in 1980 with Sue Sarandon in PBS Who Am I This Time?.  And hes proven his great song and dance abilities many times, including his terrific performance in 2007s Hairspray.  But here, he seems tired and lifeless.  Despite his insistence that hed accept the role only if it included lots of dancing, he plainly cannot keep up with the Broadway hoofers around him.  At one point, he even forgets a line, and on Live TV unlike a movie set, theres no second take. If the producers had reviewed Walkens appearances on NBCs own Saturday Night Live, they would have seen him often looking off-camera, literally reading the cue cards.

Heres why this is so critical to this play:  The story is about the clashing of three armies (not unlike Lord of the Rings), the Pirates, the Lost Boys, and the Indians. (More on that word later.)  Each army must have a leader who is clearly in command.  But in this show, neither Williams or Walken has the presence or charisma to be convincing as the leader of their respective tribes.  When we first see Hook, he just doesnt look like the Captain.  He seems small and frail, weak voiced, and simply unable to rule the tough guys by threat. (I had the same issue with Dustin Hoffman in Spielbergs Hook.)  Walken seems creepy, but not wicked.  He needs to be blustery and over-the-top, belting it out, playing to the last row in the balcony.  Again, not his fault  its simply a poor casting choice.

Both Williams and Walken seem to be reading the words, but not understanding their meaning, as if reciting Shakespeare.  Throughout the show (blame the director for this), cast members continually mis-fire the scripts humor, again merely reciting the words without any comic timing to deliver the laugh.

And even though Tiger Lily is played by a Native-American actress, her tribe are not called Indians, they are referred to as Islanders, as in Moana, or the NYC hockey team.  Sadly, it matters little since her role is so diminished.  The producers seem to feel that its somehow embarrassing to use the word Indian, but theres nothing offensive about portraying them as brave and honorable.  Indeed, they come to the rescue, first of Peter, then of the Lost Boys, who finally embrace them.  Theyve missed a great learning opportunity here about diversity and acceptance.

And whats up with the Lost so-called Boys anyway?  Theyre all full-grown men wearing schoolboy uniforms!  Unlike other productions, every cast member here is an adult (except for Michael and John and possibly Jane). The cynic in me wonders if thats because Allison would tower over them if they were actual kids.  But for goodness sake, if you're aiming for the authenticity of using a real sheepdog, why not cast real children?

Musically, I saw nothing gained by those four new songs.  With the possible exception of Lets Pretend, they are instantly forgettable, and add nothing to character backstory or advancing the plot.  And they have none of the wit, clever wordplay, or humor of the original songs.  They feel like they're from some other show.  Again, my inner cynic wonders if they were added to sell more CDs or to lengthen the program to accommodate more commercial time.

I very much liked NBCs previous effort, The Sound of Music Live.  The Julie Andrews movie is so familiar that I often wondered what that show was like when originally staged.  The TV version was thus so satisfying because like a time machine, it recreated the musical as it was onstage, with suggested sets, scrim dissolves instead of electronic, etc.  Oh yes, and it was brilliantly cast for both marquee value AND performance, including the children.

I suspect that Peter Pan Lives director and producers at some point realized their casting problem during rehearsals, but by then, contracts had been signed, an air-date had been announced, and there was simply not enough time or budget to re-cast.  Its a shame, because with this one simple fix, PPL would have been a classic for the ages.  Now, its a disappointing near-miss.

As cost prohibitive as this sounds, NBC ought to consider mounting their next production literally in a theater and run it nightly for a few months to paying audiences, with major talent understudies in reserve as backups before they deem it Ready for Prime Time.

8682613,1,B00O8RSFOE,"Nope! Watched the 1960 Mary Martin Peter Pan (which I watched over and over and over again on VHS as a kid in the eighties) with my kids and they fell in love, so we decided to watch this version and it fell flat with all of us. It just doesn't hold up in comparison, not in the singing OR in the acting departments. Even trying to divorce the beloved original from my mind (admittedly HARD to do!) there's just something missing from this one. I will say, the sets are spectacular! The performances just don't match the set quality though. Peter and Hook seem flat, and both were so very lively in the Mary Martin version. Allison Williams and Christopher Walken are great in other projects, I think that this just wasn't a proper fit for either of them. Too bad!",1490486400,,764,4.387323943661972
