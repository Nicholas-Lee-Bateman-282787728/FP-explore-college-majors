Its actually really funny, there a lot of old school Kung Fu movies were the comedy is just some facial mugging and goofy slapstick but this one has some really hilarious situations.",1414368000,,331,4.442622950819672
7933427,5,B000059HA3,"On almost every website I've seen with martial arts movie reviews, this film has been panned as been not that great in terms of the martial arts quality or content.  Usually the ending is what people recommend about this film the most, but overall, it usually gets 2 or 3 out of 5 stars type of reviews.  Personally, I strongly disagree.  Sure, when you stack it up against films like Prodigal Boxer or Magnificent Butcher, it looks rather slow and archaic.  But this film was made in 1978.  High speed action was still in its early stages.  There are plenty of martial arts scenes speckled throughout this film.  Again, they are not up to the par of Sammo's later films in terms of speed and intricacy, but they are good watching, none-the-less.  I actually liked the first fight scene at the beginning of the film, where we almost get to see all of the Legendary Weapons of China, to quote another film Lau Kar Wing was in.  They pull out weapon after weapon fighting each other.  Actually, the whole film features a lot of different traditional Chinese weapons, which is interesting to see.  Don't know if it was intentional.  I liked seeing Sammo in action using the three-sectioned staff.  Normally, I've seen him using swords and poles, so it was the first time I saw him use the multi-jointed pole.  And he's great!  Too bad he didn't use that weapon in more films.
Another cool thing about this film are all the 'cameos' by many stuntmen/actors who would go on later to star in Sammo's films or films associated with him.  It's fun picking out guys like Meng Hoi, Yuen Biao and Lam Ching Ying.  The only guy who is conspicuously absent is Leung Kar Yan.  I guess he was busy. ;>)
Overall, this is a fun film, with enough martial arts to keep a fan of the genre entertained.",1057104000,7,1781,4.5125
