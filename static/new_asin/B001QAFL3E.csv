3763296,3,B001QAFL3E,"While not quite worth $20.99 ""The Uninvited"" is an interesting little film which transcends 89 percent of the ""horror"" out there these days.

An obvious take off on ""Rosemary's Baby"", director Bob Badway is fairly unabashed in his attempt to reinvent the idea: a vulnerable young woman named Lee (Marguerite Moran) with a history of psychiatric distress coupled with a fear of everything (including space itself) marries her genuinely ominous shrink Nick, played very well by Colin Hay.

While patient/doctor relationships are never a good idea, this one goes *really* wrong.  You kind of know the psychiatrist is a shady guy when he asks Lee to pawn her grandfather's rosary for a few bucks and consistently has other ""patients"" coming into their home.

You might compare this little indie quest for subtlety to a half decent remake of ""Carnival of Souls"".  Ghouls and ghosties appear along with Old Scratch himself and there is a sort of magical realism about the whole thing--is this all happening in Lee's mind or is Nick really in league with Satan and using her to his own ends?

The chief problem with the movie is first off the derivative nature of the whole thing and second off Marguerite Moran.  Her performance in this film is about as animated and energetic as a rock.  She does very little but play the distressed female and not very well at that.  Plus she looks a bit too put together to be a person who is afraid of space and time itself.  Also, what exactly was intended by that ending?

This is worth a rental but not much more.  An admirable attempt at reviving the Satanic renaissance of the 70's.",1302825600,3,1618,4.7188612099644125
3763297,3,B001QAFL3E,"The terrible titled ""The Uninvited"" -- (really? That was the best title you could come up with?) -- actually is a well crafted thriller that's very slow and moody and ultimately doesn't go anywhere.

It's a mix of Repulsion & Let's Scare Jessica to Death & See No Evil (Mia Farrow.)

But while it borrows from all three films, it never locks into place to tell a coherent story. But there is a solid 40 or 50 mins worth of creep in this, just no payoff.",1292889600,9,453,4.255813953488372
3763298,5,B001QAFL3E,"Far from, ""Unwatchable,"" I found this film to be better than the crap Hollywood is pawning off as ""Horror.""
More of a Thriller, with some genuinely eerie moments, I really enjoyed this movie.  I'm sure the director didn't have a multi million dollar budget to work with and still I enjoyed this flick.  Reminded me of the classic horror flicks like ""Last House on the Left,"" ""Hell House,"" ect.
Good movie, well directed!",1269475200,6,420,4.739726027397261

8335306,1,B001QAFL3E,"Beginning was interesting, young woman through therapy conquers a bizarre phobia of seeing too much space. She marries the man who filmed her documentary.  That's when the movie tanks. It's a hot, SLOW mess of disjointed clips and not really scary moments that culminate in.... I don't even know what.",1398816000,,301,5.02
8335307,2,B001QAFL3E,"The only thing scary was the music, but they managed to ruined that by using it constantly.  The pacing of this film was horrible ... simple S-L-O-W.  It was exhausting waiting for something......anything.....to happen!  The ghosts looked slapped together by entry-level makeup artists.  There was no rhyme nor reason when or why they would appear...no change in the music....no scary build up.  There was just let-down after let-down.  A woman suffering from severe agoraphobia was left in her home alone for a long period of time by her husband.  At one point she reaches out from beneath her covers (on her bed) for something on the nightstand and a hand grabs her wrist.  NOTHING happens!  She doesn't jump up and SCREAM...she doesn't get up and run.  That pretty much sums up this movie.  Sad.",1379894400,,798,4.880597014925373
8335308,2,B001QAFL3E,"I was duped; tonight I was going to watch some horror films, even if they were bad, and the cable listing for this movie labeled it as the 2009 version of The Uninvited starring Emily Browning.

This one started off in a rather intriguing way, with an extended documentary sequence of the main character, Lee, and her therapy sessions to overcome a crippling fear of open spaces, so bad that in order for her to get across rooms of the house, she has to be face to face with the wall, eyes closed, feeling her way around.  And this was apparently triggered by ghosts, or her supposed encounter with a ghost as a child.

After that, we see her in a house with her husband, apparently having recovered.  But as soon as her friend tells her over webcam conversation that their house was sight to many old deaths, she starts relapsing and seeing ghosts.

I could've been fooled at this point by the movie being extremely low-budget, but what makes or breaks a director is what they do with what little they have, and the director of this film bombed badly.

Steven Spielberg kept the shark from ""Jaws"" off screen as much as possible, because he knew that if the audience got a good look at it, they would see how cheaply it was made and it would break the immersion.

This guy does the exact opposite of that.

Similarly, in many horror films that rely on a monster or on ghosts or some sight-gag, they know to keep them quick, sudden, and gone in a flash, rather than lingering too long on the face of a monster.  The longer you look at a spooky ghost or monster in a horror movie, it seems, the more you become desensitized to it, no matter horrifying the costume/makeup/prosthetics/CG is.

This guy does the exact opposite of this.

What started like a study of a woman's mental illness becomes a typical haunted house-type horror movie, complete with ghosts and long sequences in the dark with expected sudden shocks and unsettling violin playing.  The problem is, the budget is so low, that the ghosts don't look like ghosts, and there's only about 3 or 4 of them.  The old lady ghost that Lee saw as a child was just an old woman with white makeup and blue lips.  Nothing in the way the actor moves or stares sells any sort of creepiness or unsettlingness; the only reason we know she's supposed to be a ghost is because Lee said earlier in the film that the boy's grandmother in whose house she was in had died years earlier.

Similarly, there's another sequence by a telephone, and another ghost appears.  He is similarly just wearing white makeup, and with random streaks of fake blood over his face, looking like something out of a dramatic stage play, not meant to be realistic or scary, but just to imply ""Ghost"" while serving a more important role than just standing there and grinning.  The camera lingers on him, long enough for us to take him in to make for a decent police sketch artist's interpretation.

Virtually every sequence with a ghost popping up is exactly the same, with cheap, shoddy makeup and costuming, mixed with the director just eager to show off these ghosts long enough to wring out any shock value.  If this were in a packed theater, I could easily imagine the crowd screaming as a ghost appeared on screen, with the ghost remaining there long enough for the terror to die down and nervous laughter turning to mocking laughter.  And in some sequences, the ghost would STILL BE ON SCREEN, turning that derisive laughter into groans and eye-rolls.

The worst of these offenders involves a woman chewing on a blatantly fake baby arm.  This goes on far longer than even makes sense, and piles on to the bad makeup and acting with bad CG in making her disappear from sight.

On top of that, the horror sequences are so disjointed on their own, much less shafted on to an intro that is barely even connected to the horror sequences, and a nonsensical ending with a baby arbitrarily thrown in out of nowhere.",1379116800,2,3934,4.541076487252124
8335309,1,B001QAFL3E,"Terrible. The writer/directors name is Bob Badway, which is actually perfect, because you'll want this movie to end in a bad way! A complete waste of time. The plot was seemingly random and the viewer has absolutely no clue what is happening. So here we go!

The overall idea for the movie is that a woman has some sort of phobia and gets anxiety about being outside, looking out windows, or some garbage like that. She starts to have what appear to be flashbacks about something. That something never gets answered and seems to not even have any baring on the story anyway. So her anxiety starts flaring up and she starts seeing ghosts. I guess..... Still not sure if it was her phobia or ghosts? Now the movie starts heating up and we are treated to some rather amateur FX pinnacled in what looks like a man in blue makeup playing the roll of an old ghost woman. Again, this is just a guess, not sure what the old lady's role was. We are also served up a clever plot twist involving a baby and the mother that sold him to the couple. This seemed to take over as the main plotline. The woman's husband apparently bought the baby to sacrifice it to the ghosts. I think. But we don't really know if the baby's real or a ghost, why the husband was trying to sacrifice the baby, or what the ghosts even want from the baby in the first place! The phobia was also just this messed up BS. She is completely incapacitated one second, then able to fire guns at ghosts the next.....

Take this review as a warning. And I strongly suggest you heed it! Just stay far away from this one. It is a long, boring crapfest that barely deserves the one star rating I gave it. Seriously though folks, don't do it.",1377907200,,1694,4.323899371069182
8335310,2,B001QAFL3E,"WOW!!! So not what I thought it would be...it is a little spooky but there are 2 movies with the same name. This ""Uninvited"" is kinda weird, kinda B rated. Even though it was late at night I still caught some mistakes. Again, not what I thought it would be. Product from seller was in very good condition but the movie kinda, sorry to say, sucked...it gave me a fright a handful of times but kinda a dumb plot. Definitely purchase items from this seller but I would not recommend this specific movie.",1376956800,,500,4.387096774193548
8335311,1,B001QAFL3E,"I watched it just for Colin, who I adore. None of the film makes sense, explains anything, or is worth seeing unless you're so high that anything will be cool.",1369958400,2,159,4.333333333333333
8335312,1,B001QAFL3E,"The Uninvited is a really bad film with perhaps the most poorly executed ending imaginable.  It's about a young woman who has a phobia where she's afraid of wide open spaces.  This means she's forced to walk through her house starring closely at walls and everything else to avoid having to glance over at the larger areas of her home.  Eventually however, this phobia magically disappears when her life is in danger.  This is either because she realizes her life is more important than a phobia, or because of a major plot flaw.  You decide.  I mean, in the beginning she has to hide behind doors because she can't bare to look at peoples faces on the other side, but suddenly when things get chaotic, she stops having this problem.  What?  We can only assume that the need for survival outweighs everything else.

The storyline is ""my God this can't be possible"" and ""What WERE the writers thinking?"" awful.  The thing is, as a viewer, you're never sure if the home the girl is staying in is actually haunted or whether this is all part of the girls phobia and hallucinations.  To give one example, she gets these over the phone therapy sessions but on one occasion the walls start changing and get all weird.  Are the ghosts responsible for this change or are the girls phobia issues coming into the picture again?  You're constantly deciding -in the most melodramatic way possible- which one it is for the entire film.  Since 7 people died in her home, you assume it's ghosts haunting the place but... this phobia means you're never really sure.

This brings me to my next problem- the storyline absolutely *crawls*.  Whenever the girl encounters something that is wrong, get ready for mindless boredom because you'll be sitting there unsatisfied at the lack of suspense as several minutes of nothingness that's supposed to qualify as suspenseful build-up in storytelling occurs.  Other than the walls becoming distorted, throughout the film the girl sees weird things such as the volume on her TV and stereo turning up by itself, an old woman coming out of the doorway, and a man strangling her outside.  Are these things really happening?  Who knows.  Who *cares*.  There's no reason to care when the suspense isn't there.

But... it gets worse.  Hard to believe, isn't it?  Apparently the girls husband is involved in some kind of dirty business and has a baby in his possession unbeknownst to the girl, so at the end, for over 30 minutes we have to deal with the slow-moving storytelling of the baby's mother appearing and threatening the girl for her baby back, along with the repercussions of the husband concerning the baby.  May sound interesting reading it here on amazon but it's drawn out, poorly executed, poorly acted and poorly written.  Poor movie overall.  I guess the moral is, if you believe your life is in danger, you can overcome any kind of phobia.  I already knew that though.",1354320000,7,2903,4.752

8335314,4,B001QAFL3E,"This low budget psychological horror movie is well worth watching. The first half of the movie does a marvelous slow burn and is quite unnerving. Director Bob Badway is clearly a talent to watch. He creates a very weird and creepy atmosphere that pervades every frame. There are some wonderful storytelling flourishes, from the use of a documentary to introduce us into the world of the heroine as well as an excellent use of the frame. The movie definitely stumbles in the third act (listen to the engaging commentary to hear some of what went on behind the scenes) but even with a flawed ending, the creep factor of the entire film and Badway's confidence definitely makes the movie worth a discriminating viewer's time.",1323388800,2,722,4.830645161290323
