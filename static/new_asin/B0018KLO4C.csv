It is good stuff. I thought it was part of Better the Devil You Know originally, but it wasn't. This should be a good DVD release. I've seen The Bench and The Knights of Zodiac here online at Amazon, but I've never seen Intemperance or the new one that they're making now. I can't wait!",1280361600,,451,4.195402298850575
8615419,5,B0018KLO4C,"If you love Better the Devil You Know, chances are you'll love this. Funny and original. This is where it all began for these guys and it must have been exciting. Honestly, these movies are just funny. The talent shows and you have to wonder where the ideas came from. It is truly amazing to see these early shorts and to witness the building blocks that would eventually lead to Better the Devil You Know (which I highly recommend seeing FIRST in order to truly appreciate these shorts). But, just my opinion. I first saw The Bench in theaters when it played before better the devil you know. Sadly, the movie only played on a limited release, which is such a pity:(  But now you can catch it on DVD! So check it out and join the Augment Image revolution. Can't wait to see what these guys come up with next.
