8313458,5,B00000JKMZ,"This is the absolute best documentary about Avalanches ever. I've watched it again and again on TV and finally bought my own copy on VHS. The amazing and inspiring story of Lester Morlang, a man who survived three avalanches in a row is worth the price of the tape alone.  The photography is astonishing! The characters are unforgettable! The stories are riveting! You'll travel all around the world, witness actual avalanches as they happen and learn everything you ever wanted to know about the astonishing power of snow and more. This is National Geographic filmmaking at its very best. I can't wait till they put this out on DVD!!!",1312502400,,635,4.825688073394495
