3466585,4,B001ASIHX8,"I saw this movie at a film festival in Los Angeles and was pretty impressed.  I don't know what the guy that hated it was looking for but he's off the mark on about all of his critiques.  The director spoke after the screening and mentioned all the awards this won (for himself, the cast, and the movie).
If you're looking for an original, thought provoking, well made movie, I've gotta recommend this one...if you're looking for the latest cookie cutter, multiplex, by the numbers movie, then stay away.",1222300800,8,504,4.651685393258427
3466586,5,B001ASIHX8,"This film was very well done.  It was obvious the writer/director spent a lot of time thinking through this complex plot! The film kept you in suspense as to what would happen next, and had a surprise ending that wasn't typical of the norm.  The actors and actress were perfect fits for the script, and did phenomenal acting.  I would compare this film to ""No Country for Old Men,"" and would highly recommend it.  This is definitely a five star flick!",1222214400,2,451,4.530864197530864
3466587,1,B001ASIHX8,"To make up for the lack of quality films of late I have been ordering some of the locale filled indies (oft overlooked) in hopes of finding a gem that catapults a story past the overwhelming film scenery (hence I went with this and Far North tonight).

This Colorado based piece had promise with both a desolate yet majestic ranch style and authentic looking characters. In all fairness, the lead actor has the ability to carry an old school father type figure, but in the end, he could not save this D movie mess. The acting, story and script truly felt like a middle school film that got greenlit out of pity. I commend an indie group for trying, but I could never recommend this film, even for the Lifetime crowd looking for a low key western.

The story of a father trying to give his paroled son a second chance appears noble at first, but even after several lines the son is so irritating, horribly played, and fake - that you want to hit the stop button and thank yourself for putting in the next film. I did not, as I wanted to be fair. The ""tragic"" ending is so fake, contrived, unbelievable and miserable that I could only feel relief that it was over. Many reasons could be listed as support for being a poor film, including pointless dialogue, bad sets, flubbed lines, bad acting, pointless characters, etc., but in the end, it was just poor planning.

Beautiful landscapes, a nicely remodeled ranch, and old western friendliness all make for a feel good film, but please spare yourself the pain of watching this film. I wish the best for any of their future endeavors.",1221696000,,1581,4.520979020979021

3466594,1,B001ASIHX8,"DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!  This was a horrible story.  There is nothing redeeming in this film.  The setting is beautiful. The story is deceivingly endearing, when in fact it is just plain tragically awful.",1448064000,,206,4.828571428571428
3466595,3,B001ASIHX8,"It was a pretty okay movie but I hated the ending!!!! I understand the concept of father and son working on their father son relationship but why did they have to die? I didn't get that part, I really didn't understand toward the ending, come on they took father from his daughter, a love interest from Joe as well as his son!!!!! What kind of ending was that, it could have gone in a different direction, I mean the ending was not your normal ending,",1445385600,,451,4.317647058823529
3466596,4,B001ASIHX8,"I don't agree with most of the negative reviews, I thought that Broken Fences was a very moving movie.  Agreed the acting was not the best and the storyline should have been more detailing about Joe and Dylan's father/son relationship and journey to reconcile their relationship.

Why would you want this associated with your brand?  Either make it look good or drop from your movie offerings.

I recently retired so it you want someone to work from home to police your video quality, I'll send you my resume.

3466610,1,B001ASIHX8,Did not like it at all. Stayed watching it to see how worst it got. It got to fictional at the end with all that killing that the young man did.  Would not recommend.,1395619200,,166,3.8823529411764706

3466624,1,B001ASIHX8,I'm sorry but this movie is OK it is about a kid that trouble just seems to follow.  I hate to admit it but I did not finish the movie.  The writing is great.  The acting is good but I the movie I search for was a movie with a gay theme. This movie did not have any gay theme.  Amazon needs to not list in movies with a gay theme.,1392508800,,330,3.6056338028169015
3466625,1,B001ASIHX8,Hated the movie.  Definitely not worth wasting your time on this poor attempt at cinema.  Disregard this movie and move on.,1391558400,,123,4.809523809523809
3466626,1,B001ASIHX8,"It's a personal problem.  I suffer from a serious movie addiction and get really desperate for anything watchable I've not already seen--and if the movie was any good at all--at least twice.

Just like that boy who awakens on Christmas morning to find the tree buried in horse pucky and starts digging like crazy because he reckons with all that poop, there must be a pony buried under there someplace, I gamely road along with the stilted dialogue, the amateur acting and the retarded production values (otherwise known as sets, props, wardrobe and such) at the beginning of Broken Fences.  As the film opens, there actually are some very pretty panoramas of green pastures, brilliant blue skies and wide open spaces which, however, oddly mismatch the dialogue (""Been havin' a lot of rain up your way, huh?"" ""Yeah, sure have."").

Then I started itching to pick up the pace with the fast forward button, pausing for possibly key plot points. These appeared to include (in no particular order for nos. 1 through 7):
(1.) a paranormal pre-death experience as well as maudlin confessions of previously unexpressed parental love,
(2.) a self-identified ""barfly"" divorcee who moved back from California to buy the too-cute general store where three bottles of ketchup are displayed safely out of reach behind the counter (for just one example of some highly peculiar art direction--and one seriously doubts Heinz paid for that product placement),
(3.) a brief game of pool with a studly cowboy that flares into fisticuffs at the local saloon,
(4.) a misspelled homophobic graffito revealed on the side of the barn before breakfast,
(5.) a pleasant-looking sheriff (the only actor in the whole flick who could believably deliver a line) summoned to investigate the graffito incident,
(6.) the most ludicrously inept stalking of a mountain lion ever recorded on film or video (think Monty Python Goes to the Rocky Mountains), which did not involve the
(7.) one horse, partly glimpsed in a corral (but never ridden), as the entire livestock count on this ranch,
and
(8.) the climactic scene in which the weathered rancher's quasi-cute, freshly-paroled-from-prison son blows away the snooping sheriff with a shot gun (something about the studly pool player going missing and his truck showing up close-by) before
(9.) quasi-cutie then fatally impales the divorcee on a nasty piece of farm equipment (sorry . . . missed how she happened to be in the barn at the same time as the sheriff), at which point,
(10.) rancher dad returns from clomping around in broad daylight looking for the cougar,
(11.) only to take his sobbing manchild into his arms and promise ""No, son, you'll never have to go back to prison"" as
(12.) rancher dad simultaneously pulls his semi-automatic pistol (for cougar hunting? really?) from his pocket and at point blank range pumps a bullet into his boy, all the while amidst a convulsive (sorta like dry humping) full-body embrace.  Yikes! Talk about your extra-bizarre incestuous phallic symbolism!

Or how about the truly offensive ""moral"" of the story that the secretly queer son is a natural born cowboy killer who must be put down like a rabid dog?  This is some seriously sick excrement here.

Yup.  I swear I exaggerate nothing.  I've watched way more really bad movies than the average bear, but this one left even me slack-jawed in wonderment.  How such a colossal steaming cow pie could net a three star rating--AND without even resorting to any nudity whatsoever--is the strangest part of all.",1386460800,7,3518,4.996581196581197
3466627,1,B001ASIHX8,"Sound quality is bad kept going in and out, plot even worse.  I wouldnt have spent the money had I known how bad it was.",1377388800,2,120,3.8
3466628,2,B001ASIHX8,"The first half of Broken Fences is an infinitely moving story of Joe, a widowed father and Dylan, his estranged son.  Upon Dylan's release from a six year stint in prison, Joe decides to give his son another chance and allows him to live on his ranch, paying him as a hired hand and we witness a bumpy reunion of two men healing, learning to forgive each other and forming a bond they never shared before.  As Joe, Jan Van Sickle turns in a performance of quiet strength creating a quietly tough, but ultimately likable character.  Similarly, Ryan J. Parker's stuttering, nervous  Dylan breaks through barriers of having the odds stacked against him and I found myself routing for the young man.

The loosening of tensions between father and son is handled beautifully.  Enter a budding romance between Joe and  the attractive California transplant who bought the town's general store (Earla Stewart) and things are looking up for everyone in this bucolic tale.  That is until things go horribly wrong as the story descends into a nightmarish collision of improbable events and murder, murder, murder then, more murder.  If not necessarily unbelievable, the violent gear switch comes at one so out-of-the-blue that it felt like Grand Guignol more than realistic drama.

The first half of the film had me smiling and nodding at a touching, intimate family drama.  The second half had me howling with laughter and feeling embarrassed for the cast and wondering just what in the hell writer/director Troy McGatlin had in mind and why he sabotaged what started out as a heartwarming movie.  Still, I had fun watching it!",1376265600,12,1616,4.900735294117647
3466629,1,B001ASIHX8,"First the rating that I gave it is way to high. Second it is a waste of money, even though I watched it for free. The acting was stiff. The editing was horrible. Was listed as a gay movie, wrong!!! Waste of time.",1375574400,2,212,3.953488372093023
3466630,2,B001ASIHX8,"This is not in anyway a gay movie, so why is it listed under gay movies. The cover makes it look like a gay cowboy romance, but in fact it's got nothing to do with that and is one of the worst movies I ever watched.",1375228800,21,215,3.6956521739130435

3466637,5,B001ASIHX8,Broken Fences is a well made film. I liked it but have to say that I have a problem with films that end like it did. I always hope for the best at the end of the film...well I won't say much more but I would recommend it....,1367625600,,224,3.6875

The son also played true. I take it he was a special needs kid. I know a kid, personally, who is so much like that character that it breaks my heart. The actions of not knowing what to do, of working so very hard, of being polite and yet having rages of anger ran true. Therefore, I'm not sure what the ending was trying to say. It really tempered, for me, what otherwise was a pretty good flick.",1292976000,,557,4.214953271028038

Ryan Parker's performance as he becomes unwell as his psychosis takes over is superb.  So to is his Dad's reaction.

The title Broken Fences is apt for can we really mend our Broken Fences especially with Others or Them always present.
It is clear that Dylan (Ryan) has suffered some psychological trauma in his youth and this has never been resolved hence the recurrent psychotic episodes.  The final act follows the psychotic script so well, for Dylan's actions are perfectly reasonable for a mind lacking acceptable insight.
To Dylan each action is his only choice not to go back to the Hell of Prison!
