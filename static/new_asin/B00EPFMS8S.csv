5932561,2,B00EPFMS8S,"I have just viewed the movie yesterday at a movie theater, attracted by the trailer showing Vienna's museum with paintings along with the story of someone struggling to stay alive in an hospital.....

Just a few pros and cons for my 2 cents of opinion for anyone who are interested to know a bit more before going to see the movie or buying the DVD later.

Pros:
* Did show the paintings of Vienna's museum, with details on a selected few
* Parallel presentation of the world of paintings and the real world of life and death of today's people
* Subtly raised the questions about:
  Each person is basically alone, facing: life and death, hopelessness, a bit of light in the darkness and the repeated theme of: Is there truly anything that is ""timeless"" or ""priceless""?
* Friendship, however short-lasting, could definitely give us some warmth in life for a while

Cons:
* Very long movie with very slow pace: over 2 hours long
* One shot of a yellowing grass land lasts way too long: to get across the point that a person gets into the scene, and then leaves the scene, one by one....(implying ""what is the significance of a person's life?)  that shot lasts way too....long
* Unnecessary nude scenes (projecting ""could human beings become innocent again (by being nude), despite all the darkness, anyway?)
* Without a true story line or development of a story (mainly using the characters and snap shots to speak what the producer and the director want to say)
* Many shots of mundane scenes (of the streets, garbage....etc) to emphasize the mundane nature and pointlessness of human life

Lastly, I still give it 2 stars, not 1, because it did reflect some real questions in life.
Only that the audience would be expected to figure out the answers on their own.  Not unlike the book of ""Ecclesiastes"" in the Bible, pointing out mankind's hopeless conditions, and make you think where lies the answer.....

Just to let you know: This movie is not about presenting the beautiful Austria like that of ""The Sound of Music""!",1379808000,7,2021,4.686440677966102
5932562,4,B00EPFMS8S,"""Museum Hours"" (2012 release; 107 min.) brings the story of Anna, a woman in Montreal who gets a call out of the blue that her cousin Janet in Vienna is in serious condition in a hospital in Vienna. Anna takes off for Vienna. Meanwhile, we get to know Johan, a guard at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna who passes his days observing the visitors and rediscovering the beautiful paintings in the museum's collection. Comments Johan: ""In my young days, I was a tour manager for a band. Then I had my share of loudness. Now I have my share of quiet"". When Anna arrives in Vienna, she is easily lost and by happenstance comes into the museum where she gets to know Johan. Anna and Johan strike up a friendship. To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is one of those movies where the scenery itself is a major character, and yes a star, in the movie. There are tons of beautiful shots of Vienna, but even more so, the Kunsthistorisches Museum is in the leading role for this movie. At one point, about half way into the movie, we get to know one of the curators of the Bruegel room, and we get an insight as never before on several of Bruegel's more famous paintings, including The Wedding of the Peasants and The Conversion of St. Paul. So if it wasn't clear by now: if you are not really into art (paintings, in particular) and museums, save yourself the trouble (and money), and go see another movie. Second, the performances of the lead actors Mary Margaret O'Hara in the role of Anna, and Bobby Sommer in the role of Johan, are nothing short of outstanding. In particular O'Hara brings a couple of heartbreaking scenes, when she sings a couple of songs a cappella (when the credits roll at the end, it turns out that she wrote those songs, ""Never No"" and ""Dark, Dear Heart"", herself). Last but not least, kudos to writer-director Jem Cohen for pulling off this little gem of a movie.

I saw this movie just this past weekend at the Laemmle Royal Theatre in Los Angeles, and the screening I saw this at was quite well attended for a matinee, which is great news. ""Museum Hours"" is about as far away as can be from Hollywood's ""A Night At the Museum"" franchise, and that's just fine, as there is room for everyone. That said, if you are in the mood for an extraordinary and top notch foreign movie about the everyday lives of ordinary people set in the exquisite environment that is Vienna, you cannot go wrong with this movie. ""Museum Hours"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1377475200,32,2568,4.496788008565311
5932563,5,B00EPFMS8S,"This is an ambitious movie about art, death and friendship. Nothing happens in the movie: a museum guide in Vienna tours with a Canadian woman who came to visit a dying cousin. The atmosphere is not unlike that of of the highly intellectual movie Mindwalk. However, the film is not verbose, It is all in visual touches.
Dennis Lim commented in the New York Times that this is ""a gentle reminder that art is both a living thing and a way of seeing. """,1406851200,2,449,4.357142857142857
5932564,5,B00EPFMS8S,"The older one gets, the more one muses over the nature of life.  Perhaps it is because one wants to know whether one is making best use of how little of it one gets to have, or whether one is just wasting it.  For me, this movie went to the heart of this matter.  It touches upon the way most of life really is-- i.e., we hang around unreflectively and simply go through it as if we have all the time in the world.  We don't, of course, but living on the end of that skewer (that is, perpetual consciousness of the scarce commodity we are constantly wasting) would only drown us in a neurotically oceanic existential anxiety.  So we employ defensive unawareness to get through those ever so many moments in life that just happen.

  We can't make much sense of the vast majority of life's moments, any more that one can give a grand coherent singular sense to any of Brueghel's cast-of-thousands paintings of peasant scenes.  Things just happen in these paintings, just as they do in so much of real everyday life.  And these things tend to be only happenstancially connected to each other (often only by the fact that they happen to appear in the same picture), in life as in the paintings.

  In this movie, a Canadian woman of limited means spends what must have been for her a small fortune to cross the ocean and come to see an ill cousin-- who is actually in a final and irreversible comma.  Lonely and lost, she meets an equally lonely and lost man her age who happens to have for no real reason fallen into a job as a museum guard-- which for equally unexplainable reasons happens to suit him quite well (or suits him well enough to permit him the energy to be a kindly and generous individual to a stranger).  They figuratively bump into each other and, as if in a rebound, seem to fall away from each other.  But for some no special reason they choose to crawl back in each other's . . . slowly so as not to scare the other person or themselves. Carefully they pick themselves up to a standing position, so to speak, to where they come face to face in increasingly more personally intimate conversation.

  But in a very non-Hollywood manner, there are no ulterior motives at play here.  Nobody seems to be horny and on the prowl.  Each responds to the other's kindness and thoughtfulness with his or her own kindness and thoughtfulness.  He starts out by giving her directions to the strange city in which she is finding herself, and ends up accompanying her to where she can go to enjoy the town she is in.  The town that started out as a place where she would complete chores now becomes a place she can enjoy with no agenda.  Pretty soon, they are enjoying it together, in a real touristy fashion!  In the process, they pierce each other's solitude and loneliness here and there, but throughout the film the retain their separateness.  No grand affair ever erupts here!!!  Raised on Hollywood plot lines, I kept waiting for the big moment when they would ""make it"" into each other's arms and life.

  In the background, running like a spine to the whole story, the ill cousin that brought them together would never come out of her coma and to life despite little hints of hopefulness (""The doctor said that at least she didn't get any worse).  Finally the cousin-- the supposed reason for the Canadian woman's coming to Europe-- simply dies.  This is followed by a scene of what appears to be our couple enjoying each other's company in a bar one last time, and the film ends with the museum (that repository of ""things""), going/continuing on and on-- even after that relationship we saw ever so slowly building up seems to be out of the picture.

  I might add that the film confronts us not only with the prosaic, but with the contrast between the prosaic and the even more prosaic nature of life.  That is to say, images flash between the museum and its seemingly high falutin art objects and a flea market on the street selling ever so low falutin everyday object (some seemingly just junk). One is left with a sense that either high or low falutin, life is transitory and follows (or perhaps I should say, stumble through) its own  happenstancial course regardless of what noble meanings or Hollywood-like ulterior motives we might wish to ascribe to it.

  If you check out some of my other reviews, you will notice that I am somewhat given to such intricate, Warburgian-type, high-culture interpretations of movies, because I believe film is fundamentally that elevated (and elevating) a degree of an art form.  In its strange form of story telling, film goes to the core of our deepest fears and concerns.  Its light illuminates the dark corners of the mind we might otherwise be too afraid to explore.  This movie is well within this tradition, and it conveys its ""sense"" (as opposed to ""message"") of the transitory and relative meaning of things very well.  It requires a practiced patience to get through it, which academic high culture training helps one acquire, but which its appreciation does not absolutely necessitate.  I, too, love action movies-- having seen this movie after watching a Borne Identity film.  But this movie is R-E-A-L-L-Y  SOMETHING  SPECIAL !!!!!!!!",1405728000,3,5200,4.619411123227917
5932565,1,B00EPFMS8S,"In a word....  Stinks.

Boring.  Who cares?

The Bruegel lecture was great - and this film could have been a great documentary about Bruegel - or about the Museum, or about Vienna - or a great story about the museum guard - or the Canadian woman - or even the comatose woman - but wasn't.  Instead, it was a monumental waste of time masquerading as avant-garde.

I'd guess this is why it was such a great commercial success?",1404345600,,424,4.371794871794871

5932567,4,B00EPFMS8S,"Jem Cohens Museum Hours is another hybrid fiction/documentary film. A middle age American woman, Anne, has been summoned to Vienna because her name was found in the address book of a cousin who lies comatose in a hospital there. She has never been to Vienna before, doesnt speak the language, and has little money. She meets Johan, a middle age museum guard at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, and he becomes her interpreter, tour guide and friend. On one level the movie is the fairly simple but touching story of their evolving relationship. Will romance blossom? Alas, no. Johan is gay and Anne, though single, must return to America. Their relationship, with its thoughtful conversations, is the fictional part of the movie.

The film, however, is about much more than these two people, endearing though they are. We also get to know the museum in which they spend much of their time. We inhabit for a while a richly photographed world and ponder, as Anne and Johan do, a range of subjects: cities, art, time, sight, museums, property, collective memory, the flux of objects, transience, maturity. Have I left out anything? Oh, yes. Brueghel and the room in the Kunsthistorisches Museum that contains many of his masterpieces: Peasant Wedding, Childrens Games, The Conversion of Paul, The Fight Between Carnival and Lent. Because Johan is our guide as well as Annes our introduction to Brueghel and the museum and the imperial city that contains them is relaxed and intimate, much more personal than a conventional documentary would be. Jem Cohens camera eye  probing, playful, wise  becomes our eye.",1401062400,5,1601,5.033962264150944

5932569,1,B00EPFMS8S,"If the intent of this film was to immerse the viewer in a painful journey of the mundane life of an exasperated and unfortunate Canadian woman's happenstance Vienna and the equally disenchanting existence of a museum guard  well then maybe I should be giving this film the magnanimous stars that other reviewers have. I fear, however, my opinion of this film differs greatly from those reviews. I found this picture to be extremely dark, uninspiring, and downright depressing. With all that Vienna and the Kunsthistorisches Art Museum have to offer the accidental tourist it is bewildering that someone would consciously elect to use one of the worlds most beautiful cities and culturally majestic landmarks as the backdrop for this ominous interpretation of two common strangers chance and most assuredly lackluster encounter.",1398643200,3,827,5.312977099236641
5932570,5,B00EPFMS8S,"This is one of the most beautiful, haunting, meaningful films I've seen in a long time. There's no real plot, no real narrative, no real drama ... so much so that many call it boring, tedious, and complain that nothing happens. Yet they're missing one of its central points: the Nothing that happens is actually Something. In its simple, single thread of story, the museum guard Johan befriends the Canadian woman Anne, who's come to Vienna to be with a cousin who's fallen into a coma. Anne has little money, and Johan not only shows her the city in a way that doesn't need a lot of money, but shows her empathy & subtle human connection. Movie conventions would have us expect a typical romance to follow; but this film is far wiser than that.

In truth, the film is more of a meditation, even a tone poem, on art & life. Each fleeting image takes on the aspect of a painting, rich & brimming with possibilities, not unlike the masterpieces in the museum. And those masterpieces are shown to be filled with possibilities themselves, always open to new interpretations & revelations, rather than being dead & static. The viewer is invited to pause & really look at the world, down to its most (seemingly) mundane details, to see the beauty & mystery that hovers over every moment of existence.

For example, when Johan asks Anne if she saw anything interesting earlier in the day, she tells him of seeing a flock of pigeons at the bottom on a concrete embankment, scattered on the ground ""like pepper"" -- and how they suddenly flew up in a perfect arc into the sky. It's something any of us might see any day, without noticing it in the least. But how many of us would really look at it & truly SEE it, in all its wonder & grace?

What strikes me in particular is the lack of conflict, deemed so essential for any story today. Johan senses the loneliness of a fellow human being & responds to it, simply because he's a decent human being. He has no hidden agenda, no terrible inner secret driving him to help. He & Anne are just two human beings who have lived long enough, with enough sensitivity, to have been bruised without being broken, who can look at the world around them with more compassion than regret or resentment. They have genuine wisdom, a wry, rueful, but certainly not defeated view of life, one that enables them to decline from passing judgment on others as an unthinking reflex. They observe, they reflect, they laugh, they share their common humanity. Everything is understated, which somehow makes for a more complex & mature emotional response from the viewer.

In short, this is a reminder of what a civilized life is supposed to be, something that's sorely lacking in much of today's fast-paced, profit-driven, terribly superficial world. As such, it won't appeal to every viewer; but for those who value a life that goes deeper than the latest trends & fads, this is essential viewing -- most highly recommended!

Note: the DVD includes three short films by the same director, each of which is a meditation on art & life in its own way. The addition of these films reveal the sensibilities & vision of the director, and makes me want to see more of his work.",1398211200,4,3186,4.592267135325132
5932571,5,B00EPFMS8S,"Jem Cohen solicits Mary Margaret O'Hara to narrate, walk through the city of Vienna, the bombastic Kunsthistorisches Museum as a grand gesture of art as a process, a history of man, all whom have gone before, reintrepreted endlessly, wonderfully. Befriending a museum guard as solace to her lonely heart journey we get an insiderers peek beyond imagination. Uniquely conceived format for his second ever feature film has so much substance/sustenance to take in I can't conceive time of possible saturation. Our odd couple, drawn together by chemistry, need come from the ""we  are over 50 club"". They frequent numerous cafes, clubs, haunts as diverse as the art collections inside, the hallows halls of the wide circle of every imigrant imaginable landed, rooted, each its own museum of particulars, peculiars, and proclivities.

A reputable film maker, our autuer has a broard range of subjects material of which we get three films ranging in length 8 to 45 minutes as bonus bucks bonanza. This may be to quiet and drab for some but if you are the art history type you will love this approach. Perhaps like my embrace it is something much more than a story of lovely, lonely lady gone to foreign shores to comfort the last days of a cousin in coma, her only real kin. Countless moments held in time of a city and museum with a endless, breath taking views. My god I love this film.",1397260800,6,1381,4.7740585774058575
5932572,5,B00EPFMS8S,"A very satisfying film about the relationship between a Viennese museum attendant and a visiting Canadian woman.  Not a love story, just a sensitive friendship that begins and ends.  My favorite film of 2013.",1395878400,2,208,5.088235294117647
5932573,5,B00EPFMS8S,"It's hard to review a film this uniquely incredible, but I'll try.

MUSEUM HOURS looked like it might be kind of boring, but after watching, I can't see why any more or less adult person would not be enthralled by at least certain aspects of this film. Though pretty distractible, I was held spellbound from start to finish. Like most people, I generally like a strong plot-line with tension, surprises, and all of that. While MUSEUM HOURS has very solid character development and cohesion between its scenes, it just isn't a story-story and is one of those rare films that doesn't need much sequence of events. It's far less depressing than it may appear and actually quite funny in certain--naked people casually strolling the Kunsthistoriches, Johann's narration of missing strategic body parts on ancient sculptures--places.

This film is, of course, all about art imitating life and vice versa. But don't let that scare you off. It's totally lacking in pretense and plays no tricks on its audience, carrying the casual viewer along with it. If I'm making MUSEUM HOURS sound like stoner-stuff, I can only say that it's a drug of the very best kind. Brilliantly simple, without any of the obscurantist b.s. we often encounter in films of this sort.

There's a lot about Bruegel, one of the few painters who's ever meant much to me. Yet, even if Bruegel doesn't move you, other things in this film most likely will. Tons of miscellaneous images, some ""everyday,"" some ""famous art"": MUSEUM HOURS gives new insights into even the simplest, oft-ignored imagery. You'll never be able to look at another landscape--real, imagined, on canvas, whatever--in a cursory way again. Forgive me, but MUSEUM HOURS is truly mind-expanding.

The biggest reason why this film succeeds in being artsy without any of the negative connotations of that term is that it's narrated by Johann, a guard at the famous museum in Vienna who, though he's never been a particular fan of painting, has had much time to stare idly at the artwork--which, of course, includes the visitors and everything else around him--until it becomes so familiar that he notices new details and meanings with every view. Anne, the  visitor from Montreal who likes art-in-general but is in Vienna mainly to visit her sister in the hospital, provides further perspectives in her conversations with Johann. There is also a very memorable five minutes with Gerda, amazingly keen in her descriptions but still friendly and open-minded with her tour group.

I don't give five full stars to many films, but anything less would be an injustice here. Though I'm sure that I'd EVENTUALLY grow tired of it, I could watch MUSEUM HOURS every night for quite a while.",1393372800,3,2708,4.953744493392071
5932574,4,B00EPFMS8S,"Having lived in Wien many years ago, this film was a set up for me to like.  But in addition to my personal pro bias, Museum Hours was so cinematically evocative of place, the characters so deftly portrayed, and the themes so subtle but powerful, this film has an impact on viewers in general.  I find myself thinking of it and wanting to view it again.
While a refreshing break from movies that overwhelm with special effects and violence, Museum Hours could have a bit more plot, although that might destroy the mood.  And mood is much of what it is.
Strong theme of watching the people watching the paintings was great, as well as the lingering and lingering of the camera on an image creating a feel of a painting, not so much a movie.",1393372800,3,739,4.419117647058823

5932576,1,B00EPFMS8S,"I saw this film in a theater with friends and all of us were disappointed and BORED.  I'm sure there were redeeming qualities - the artwork was beautiful - but it went on and on and on.......  We didn't care about the characters, who they were or where they had been or where they were going.

Reading the other review makes me wonder if we saw the same film.",1390867200,4,359,4.173913043478261
5932577,5,B00EPFMS8S,"There were only thirteen people in the theater when I saw this film. While pairs of us knew each other, none of us knew the others. At its finish, we all stood around outside and talked about it. Everyone was so moved by the beauty of the sweet story with its lovely characters and its great metaphor that it was with reluctance that we went our separate ways.

The comatose cousin - being kept alive, yet brain-dead - is observed by the two main characters as if she were a still life like those in the gallery. There to be seen, the Dutch masters' eternally beautiful flowers and fruit are threatened by insects and decay. They remind us of the transitory nature of life and of the inevitability of death, their message set into position the way the lady has been arranged in the hospital, hovering between the present and her future. But there is nothing morbid to this delicately wrought film.

So sensitively was it nurtured into existence - a story compellingly related in the booklet accompanying the DVD - that, of course, it was overlooked entirely by the Golden Globe people and so far unmentioned by the Motion Picture Academy folk (who are drawn elsewhere). ""Museum Hours"" is the rarest of the rare: an elegiac tribute to life as it can be savored through the beauty of painting.",1389916800,4,1291,4.608695652173913

5932580,5,B00EPFMS8S,"Nothing much happens in MUSEUM HOURS in terms of plot: the action focuses on the experiences of a guard at the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna (Bobby Sommer), as he observes the different types of visitor and reflects on the exhibits in the art gallery.  He has a chance encounter with Anne (Mary Margaret O'Hara), a Canadian visitor who has come to see her sick relative in Vienna; and together they visit different parts of Vienna, as well as making regular visits to the hospital.  Filmed on a minuscule budget. Jem Cohen's film reflects on the relationship between art and film, concentrating in particular on how (and whether) paintings by the Old Masters 'speak' to different types of viewer.  Through brilliant use of visual compositions, Cohen shows how the daily rituals of Viennese life bear a strong similarity to those compositions portrayed in the paintings (for example, the work of Brueghel).  This is designed to prove how the artists drew their inspiration from life, as well as their imagination.  Other sequences are quasi-surrealistic - at one point we see three visitors to the museum who are naked, adopting poses very similar to those represented in the paintings.  This technique emphasizes the importance of the imagination in the way we look at paintings.  The relationship between art and life is reinforced by Johann's voiceover, as he reflects on the paintings, the visitors, and his reactions to both at any given moment.  Beautifully shot (by Cohen and Peter Roehsler) in muted colors on a series of winter days, MUSEUM HOURS is a masterpiece of cinema, reflecting on the viewer's relationship to visual objects.",1386979200,13,1644,5.08550185873606

5932582,5,B00EPFMS8S,"I saw this little masterpiece immediately upon its UK release early last month - at an exceptionally well attended matinee screening at the Cornerhouse, Manchester. As the previous reviewers have stated, the film dwells a great deal on some of the paintings housed at the Museum of Art History in Vienna...especially those of Peter Breugel the Elder. Immediately we are bewitched  by their sense of mystery - and all the possible meanings that the passage of the intervening centuries has hidden from us. But we are also taken on a voyage of exploration - through the magnificent gallery, through the bleak but beautiful winter cityscape and through the layers of Vienna's own fascinating history. The chance meeting that leads to a touching friendship between the room guide and the visitor provides us with further insights into the very things that must have preoccupied those early painters - the joy of living, mortality and the transience of things.

I saw this movie on the Saturday. On the Monday I was on the plane to Vienna - and by the Tuesday morning I was experiencing the Museum of Art History for myself. Can any film have a higher recommendation than that?",1381622400,22,1172,4.884422110552764

This movie is Mary Margaret O'Hara who I never forgot from her performance on David Sanborn's Night Music show looking at a few paintings in an Austrian museum and the going nowhere conversation efforts of a native son.  And MMO plays the small talk nobly.

Trying to be interesting certainly in that way gleaned from a what would be considered a doable - not hipster - but whatever the 80s version of that was - not rich, not athletic, not ambitious enough to be a frat boy financier - wanting to be around doting pretty kind gentle people who were doting because they were liberal humane artist types (I just wanted a job and my own very good masculine apartment but in high school, I did notice that looking a certain way came with a certain obvious tolerance and some of THOSE people weren't really nice at all but they were studiously PC.)

So the dialogue is written by someone whose thought deeply about the character development of the Austrians - Mary Margaret O'Hara was hired for herself - that sharp pointy unpredictable quality that both she and her more openly shocking sister (those eyes) Catherine possess - which makes you wonder - not about the Irish - but the Canadian environment (Dare Wright's official story = shenanigans) - they need to be cast in the Neil Gaiman Sandman movie.

I'm sure Jews appreciated the Brueghel paintings.

MMOs can't be assigned to Brueghels to keep the peace forever.  Its asking a lot of them - that they can deliver the charm - it's hard work - and she does not belong in that tiny room in that uncomfortable bed.

And eventually, it's not enough for some of them anyway.  It's not real.  It's not genuine chemistry or appropriateness.  It really corrects nothing - it's not like oh, if they had had an Ellen Page/Juno to be their constant companion in high school, they never would have shot their classmates.

8607968,4,B00EPFMS8S,"Museum Hours is a film documentary with a fictive narrative set in Vienna,the city and the Kunsthistorisches Art Museum. Johann(Bobby Sommer) a guard,encounters Anne(Mary Margeret O'Hara),a foreign visitor called to Austria because of the poor health of a cousin,who is in hospital with a coma. These two characters,are loosely based on their real lives,one a singer getting some work in Canada through the support of friends,the other having been a manager in the punk music business. The film just hangs together on the fragile narrative,as Anne asks for help finding the hospital from the museum guard,she doesn't speak German,and he also shows her around Vienna to parts he hasn't seen in a long time,the less touristy parts. They strike up a friendship useful to them both. He is gay but his lover has deceased,she is lonely,poor and a long way from home. They cheer each other up and keep each other amused. He gives her a free pass to the Museum,so she can come whenever she wants and look at the art works,from the Egyptians,Greeks and Romans,via Cranach and Breughel up to the Dutch and Renaisance painters. They both go to the hospital.

The film is shot on 16 mm and digital(interiors) and has a palette of dark hues and autumnal and winter tones. I found the film hard to get into at 1st,having to watch it at least 3 times to let it grow on me. What I found difficult is that the film has no real action,drama or plot elements to hook you or draw you in. There are many darkened scenes hard to make out and the sound is poor,the articulation fuzzy. When characters speak their faces are often in the dark or they're shot from the side so you can't even see their lips or faces. There is little animation(they being strangers to each other),yet they are just plausible enough to believe in. They are also both non-actors. There are no subtitles (apart from when he speaks German,optional).

Having said that I liked the idea of the Art Museum as being a special space where the public can view works of art free of considerations of price (apart from the price of entry),where the viewer's gaze transports them to this other world,set free from considerations of time and cost,reaping the harvest of value,history and beauty. The central art works under consideration are Breugel's. The lecturer offers her own overview:the focus of his paintings was not the ostensible subject. He painted all of humanity,the `hallucination of the real',elements from allegory and folklore. He even disguised himself as a peasant to be able to paint their lives. She refers to Auden's description of the Fall of Icarus,how Breugel depicts the event,the world going on as if nothing has happened. But the realistic observation of Bruegel was more at liberty when, in his last period, he frankly took the life about him as his subject, for it had been that which interested him chiefly even when depicting sacred themes. He also had a vast conception of nature,new to his time. The film connects the classical art and the streets,what's inside and what's outside the museum.

Somewhere towards the end Johann remarks ""One begins to wonder what the real subject is""while describing an old woman walking up a path. In another scene Anne looking at a painting of a late Rembrandt says,""there doesn't seem much there,as if it came from nothing and will go back to nothing. There's a lot of detail in thedarkness.""Far be it for me to use these quotes to undermine the film's intent,but they are telling. What was especially good was the way the film shot images outside the museum which matches imagery of the paintings of Breugel,like birds in the trees,on the ground or in flight,or images of detritus,cans,egg-shells,gloves. The inspiration for the film is John Berger's famous Ways of Seeing, expressing gratitude to him in the end -credits. Johann watches the viewers studying the works of art,the babies, the schoolkids,bored or dallying to see the erotic work or scenes of cut off heads. In another scene he slyly has the adult onlookers become as naked as the painted nudes they look upon.

The 2 songs Margaret O'Hara sings are her 1st original compositions since 2000. Cohen `s film is rooted in photography and emphasises anonymity. We also get Breughel's `snapshots' of lived experience. The voiceover comes from Johann watching the film himself. We get a sense of the transcience of things,everything seen in relation to each other,with no sense of hierarchy and separation. Cohen's interest is in themarginal,found and outsider art. He locates in a caf frequented by immigrants,with all their posters,photos framed on a wall,toilet signs, showing a democratic gaze. As we depart the museum,shots of cranes,a little old lady walking away,images of junk shop wares, the hangers left in Anne's ward-drobe as she leaves city and Johann behind,the procession of images glides past and disappears. Friendship has altered Anne's way of looking. The film has found a way to connect the past and present with transcient images.",1410739200,2,5021,4.938461538461539
8607969,5,B00EPFMS8S,"This movie plays a little bit like a documentary. The main character is the Kunsthistorisches Museum. One of the museum's guards and a woman from Montreal, Canada at a loss in a strange city provide the human element bringing about a celebration of life and art.

The two characters appear to have uneventful lives which only makes the film more real. They are brought together in unusual but mundane circumstances and manage to find a camaraderie that is warm and very special. This film is a true celebration of art and friendship.",1409616000,,533,4.793478260869565
