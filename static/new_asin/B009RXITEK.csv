I didn't see where the description had said it was in Japanese (With subtitles) only, however I grant that it might have been an oversight on my part. However, it still has a good story line and I am overall pleased with the purchase. I would recommend for anyone who likes the occult and a little bit of humor on the side.",1492041600,,497,4.1875
8543983,4,B009RXITEK,"When Maya's father dies unexpectedly, she decides to take over his post as the principle of Waldstein Academy, also known as Occult Academy due to its focus on the study of paranormal disciplines. Maya, who both disbelieves and dislikes the occult, meets Fumiaki Uchida, a time agent from the future sent to 1999 to prevent the apocalyptic Nostradamus Prophecy. The predictions states that the school will be ground zero of the cataclysm that will destroy the world. Maya and Fumiaki must team up to discover the truth behind her father's death and to prevent the apocalypse.

I had read reviews that talked about how the first episode showed such promise and the episodes following went steeply down hill. I wasn't all that impressed by the first episode, so the series could only get better for me. I thought the first 10 episodes were fun, but nothing special. Maya starts out seeming to be a very tough and collected character, but quickly devolves into a helpless, abusive character. I have never understood how the Japanese could find it so amusing for women to slap men around at the smallest provocation. The other characters were similarly flat. I enjoyed watching them, but didn't particularly like any of them.

But the story is fun. It doesn't much of anywhere until the last three episodes, but when it finally gets there it has interesting and touching wrap up of the series. The filler stuff at the beginning had some creative takes that kept me watching. I was never bored during the series, and never felt like I was wasting my time watching it. I really liked the way it ended. Nothing really surprising, no twist endings, but it did change things around and bend your mind a little, while coming up with an acceptably happy ending.

The DVD set comes with episodes 1-13 (complete) + 4 bonus short episodes on two DVDs (contains same bonus features as the Premium Edition). Japanese audio only, English subtitles.",1370563200,10,1931,4.827794561933535
