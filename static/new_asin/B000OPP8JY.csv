8220831,5,B000OPP8JY,"Patlabor 2 came out in 1993, this is to say the least an older anime film. There haven't been many reviews for this particular set up so I just thought I would post up something in case fans were on the fence about this collection.

Pros :
- The transfer is just fantastic to view. It seems like Bandai Visual got the Master copy and was able to have it transferred to Blu Ray.
- The Sound transfer is fantastic, Unnatural City sounds so wonderful coming through your TV/Sound systems speakers.
- The Packaging is kinda like a 2 DVD set box set. The outer box is wonderful to see.
- Story, if you are reading this you know the story... FANTASTIC

Cons:
-The Dub is the Bandai dub from the 2000's. I prefer the Manga dub from the 90's but this is only a minor gripe.
-The set only came out in Japan, besides here it is tough to hunt down.
- The DVD is Region 2 (a no brainer, but still needs to pointed out.)

I didn't buy this set from Amazon, I got it used while I was in Japan at a Book-Off in Kobe. I spent the equivalent of $68USD.
But if you want a great transfer then you will be happy. Think of it like the transfer that was done for Akira from Bandai Visual / Honneamise. It is that wonderful to view. Hope this helps.",1392681600,2,1226,4.078838174273859
