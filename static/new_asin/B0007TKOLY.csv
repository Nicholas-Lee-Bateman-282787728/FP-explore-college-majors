Patton was born in 1885. Then I tried watching several of the episodes. My favorite error: Montgomery crossed the Rhine on March 7 1945 and was the first to cross the Rhine since Napoleon. Say what? Montgomery was the third to cross the Rhine. The US First Army crossed at Remagen 16 days before Montgomery. Patton's Third Army crossed March 22nd a full day before Montgomery. If I wanted to get sick, I would have watched more and found more errors. I do not recommend this DVD set to anyone.",1424390400,,649,4.408333333333333

This is a good set to have.",1386374400,,105,3.8181818181818183
8051492,1,B0007TKOLY,"Basically a series of old photos, newsreel footage and interviews with veterans.  The series starts off well, but quickly goes downhill and eventually becomes pure torture to watch.  The fifth hour, ""Birth of the Special Forces"" consists entirely of interviews with veterans (which is OK) but uses the same 30 second soundtrack looping over and over for the entire hour!  I gritted it out to the end but was left with the feeling that I had been listening to DVD ""intro music"" over and over and it couldn't be turned off.  To turn the sound off would have made the speakers inaudible.  Bottom line - if you like wasting money and want to be driven insane, this DVD is for you!",1267142400,3,676,4.553719008264463
8051493,2,B0007TKOLY,"This 6 disc set (10 episodes) starts out well -- the first two hours are good, with a narrator, footage, and interviews. You know, the stuff you expect to see in a documentary. After that, the producers apparently ran out of money and/or effort, because the rest of the discs are lame. Most of them are just old news reels slapped together. Not that the newsreels themselves aren't interesting or appropriate, but there is nothing else there. No commentary, no narration, no interviews. By the time google puts the national archives footage on-line you can see the same thing for free.",1141430400,9,585,4.801980198019802
