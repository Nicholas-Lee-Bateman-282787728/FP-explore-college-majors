8251770,5,B0013LL2UC,"This is a fantastic boxed set. If you're into old school gory horror and 60s/70s grindhouse flicks like me, youll love this. When i bought this i had never seen any of Jims films ive only came accross The Manson Family DVD in stores and it looked cool and i ended up buying this box set. Both Deadbeat at Dawn and The Manson Family are awesome gritty independent movies. Included in the box set is Vanbebbers short films as well, the best of which is My Sweet Satan.

If you love independent horror/action films and have a twisted sense of humor you owe it to yourself to pick this set up. Its great",1348099200,4,599,4.300884955752212

8251772,5,B0013LL2UC,"These films are stunning and this DVD collection of long-out-of-print works by Jim VanBebber is long overdue. They're deeply sick, sexy, gory, shocking, disgusting...and absolutely brilliant altogether. I'll be surprised if Jim ever directs another feature, unfortunately, due to his rep, but even if he doesn't we still have these gems to remind us of his visual genius.
