3671584,5,B001KW08L8,"Last year, my second semester Social class was learning about Hitler, and the Nazi party. We came across a short film called ""The Wave"", which was based on a true story about a teacher who taught his class about Hitler in a shocking way: He formed a social club called The Wave, where he brainwashed the kids into acting like Hitler. At the end of the week, he revealed to the kids he was using them to act like Nazis, so that they could learn about Hitler. My entire class was shocked and surprised, no matter how dated it was.

After school, I got home, booted up my laptop and went on IMDb to find out more about the movie, when I came across a page for a German re-imagining called ""Die Welle"". Now it's not released here in Canada, but I managed to have found an import Region-free DVD with subtitles at the video store during spring break. So having found the copy, I rushed it to the front and laid down the bucks. Then of course, I immediately began watching it when I got home!

I was quite surprised by how good the movie was. I mean, it has great acting, it's gorgeously shot, it tells the story in a way that's shocking yet refreshing. And most importantly, it was entertaining.

The movie tells the story of Mr. Wenger. He is new to the school he teaches at, and his wife teaches at the school too. He is assigned to teach a social studies class. So he gets there, and the class is full of boring and depressing-to-look-at drones. His first day goes over not so well, so the next day, he decides to bring some energy to the class. In teaching about Hitler, he gets people to stand up when they talk. He gets them to to several odd things you wouldn't find in a classroom. Soon this becomes a social club called ""The Wave"". This is his way of teaching the kids about Hitler in a sense where they won't become bored. Throughout the week, the club spreads like a wave, and thus it spirals out of control!

If you all remember Battle Royale, remember how the kids were forced to kill each other until one remains? Well, that's basically this movie in a nutshell. There's very little violence in the film, yet that's a good thing- it makes the movie even more disturbing. There's good acting in the film, great cinematography, and a shattering climax including the ending, which will knock you flat. If you enjoy a good intellectual flick, then do see ""The Wave"". It's Germany's very own ""Battle Royale"".

IN TOTAL:

Entertainment: 10/10
Sex: 0/10
Violence 1/10
Shock factor: 10+/10
It makes you think, doesn't it? 10/10
Would I want to go to a school like that? Definitely not.

3671585,4,B001KW08L8,"""The Wave"" is a German film directed by Dennis Gansel. The film is based on a true story of an experiment by a high school teacher, Ron Jones, who taught a class in autocracy, and demonstrated how easily the masses could be manipulated. The experiment was called The Third Wave, and it took place at Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California during the first week of April, 1967. This film is a warning to all about how fragile democracy is as within a week a class of students were manipulated to accept a fascist point of view. The movie convincingly conveys the transistion, and how it affected a community.",1261699200,5,615,4.6
3671586,5,B001KW08L8,"Germany, The Present: Rainer Wenger (Jorgen Vogel) is a middle-aged high school teacher who has been reluctantly tasked with teaching an optional class on the notion of ""autocracy"" during project week. A former anarchist himself, Wenger initially encounters gentle resistance from his teenage wards - who are predominately the indulged, privileged children of successful middle class intellectuals who have been so inculcated with the historical significance and conduct of the Nazis that they have come to believe that it would be impossible for a dictatorship such as the National Socialist Worker's Party to rise to dominance again. With this in mind, Wenger initiates a week-long practical experiment in the class in order to examine whether just such an event is truly possible. But as the class begin to coalesce around the authoritarian youth movement, which they name ""The Wave"",events begin to run out of control...

Like its recent German contemporary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Experiment/dp/B00009AVA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Experiment</a>, ""The Wave"" is a fictionalized account of events which actually occurred in the US: ""Das Experiment"" was a reimagining of Philip Zimbardo's notorious ""Stanford Prison"" experiments (chronicled in his book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lucifer-Effect-Understanding-How-Good-People-Turn-Evil/dp/0812974441/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil</a>) and ""The Wave"" is based on an actual class experiment which allegedly ran out of control in Pao Alto, California in the late sixties (and which was fictionalized by Morton Rhue/Todd Strasser in his book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wave-New-Windmills/dp/0435123785/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wave (New Windmills)</a>).

Dennis Gansel's film is a thought-provoking examination of the nature of unity, peer pressure and social affiliation in contemporary society which eschews easy conclusions about just who is susceptible to the corrupting nature power. In less talented hands it could have been an utterly pedestrian exercise, but Gansel explicitly (but subtly) demonstrates how the initially attractive notions of strength through social unity and cohesion can be perverted. Alarmingly, like the school principle who is initially won over by the way in which Wenger's Wave experiment appears to motivate his students, the audience finds itself seduced by the way in which the initially disparate and feckless students begin to work together as a unit in order to win at Water Polo and produce the school play, but to Gansel's credit when events inevitably take a turn for the sinister, he refuses to indulge in soap opera; his teenage subjects do not degenerate into faceless automatons but rather retain their very realistic personalities within the framework of their movement. One witnesses the march of the innocently unaware into the jaws of totalitarianism: when, for instance, they adopt a salute, they relate to the concept of it as ""mellow, chilled-out"" sign of social greeting rather than to the overtly sinister vaguely connotation that it has for outsiders (something which, one must inevitably conclude, also played out in the streets of nineteen thirties Germany amongst members of the Hitler youth).

Gansel also subtly examines the way in which the concept of tribal affiliation extends far beyond ""The Wave"". When his white-shirted protagonists face off against a group of anarchist punks, one is struck by the uniformity of the so-called rabidly individual anarchists. Similarly, when ""the wave"" turn out in droves to support the school water polo team, one is prompted to ponder the inherent uniformity that exists amongst ""normal"" sports fans who turn out in their colours to support their teams in everday life.

A brilliant depiction of the unwitting seduction of the gullible, ""The Wave"" is one of the most thought-provoking treatise on the corruption of social affiliation that you'll see in mainstream cinema.",1261267200,43,4149,6.063032367972743
3671587,4,B001KW08L8,"How do you relate to an unthinkable heritage?  It is easy enough to embrace and celebrate the heroic struggles that define one's cultural or national identity, but is it enough to label the evils as such in order to safely relegate them to the past?

In Dennis Gansel's film The Wave (Die Welle) a likeable but unorthodox German high school teacher sets out to demonstrate to his students that fascism is still possible, and finds his experiment to be more successful than even he had predicted. Rainer, who had been planning to teach a course on anarchism and punk rock, is assigned to teach a special module on fascism and autocracy.  Confronted with the apathy of students who find the topic both irrelevant and done to death, he decides to try another approach: he shows them firsthand just how appealing a regime based on order, unity and discipline can be.

As the students' fascination with dictatorial techniques of social control leads to their enthusiastic participation, the newly established community takes on a life of its own that grows dangerously out of control.  The film is based on a true story of a teacher in California who, at the peak of the social upheaval in the 70's, wanted to show his students how Nazi Germany and the horrors of Auschwitz could come to be.  The genius of the film - which manages to be thoroughly engaging and fun to watch at the same time as it raises important questions - is in its seamless adaptation of this story to a very different time and place, showing how easily the universal need for acceptance and desire to belong to something important can be perverted into a system that promotes hatred of the nonconformist and of the outsider.",1258675200,3,1692,4.71864406779661
3671588,3,B001KW08L8,"The Wave is of team values as imperative for personal victory and overcoming private problems.

A very sensitive topic for Germany, it's embedded from a general notion of fascism as only a way work in team leads to as a teacher-ex-monarchist tried to make a class water-polo team winning a competition.

3671589,3,B001KW08L8,"The Wave, the ninth movie directed by young German film maker, Dennis Gansel, cleverly explores the propensity for fascism to remerge in this technologically more sophisticated age.  The main character Rainer Wenger, played by Jurgen Vogel, is a left leaning high school teacher who is given a week to present a special project course on Autocracy to senior students.  When one of them suggests that Nazism could not remerge he decides to conduct an interesting experiment.  He insists that while in class the students always rise to speak to him and address him as Herr Wenger.  The following day he introduces calisthenics, where the students stamp their feet in unison.  In the days following they adopt a name, a uniform, identifying insignia and salute.  These reinforce collective solidarity and distinguish the group from the broader school community. Authoritarianism is rewarded and independence of thought suppressed. Those not willing to internalize the group-think are ostracized and socially excluded. The climax of the film is reached when a highly suggestible, disaffected youth with a fractured childhood responds tragically when the group is disbanded.  He takes matters into his own hands with dramatic results.  Do we take the narrative seriously?  Well, I suppose the film reminds us of Brecht's prescient observation in his brilliant parody of Hitler, ""The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui"", that the seeds of Fascism remain dormant: ""Do not rejoice in his defeat, you men, for though the world has stood up and stopped the [...], the bitch that bore him is still in heat"".

3671681,4,B001KW08L8,"Based on the true story of a California High School Teacher in the 70's whose history class students didn't think that what happened in Germany in WW2 could happen again and also couldn't understand why the people there didn't rise up and stop it.  So the
teacher decided to initiate an experiment without divulging the purpose, where he copied some of the totalitarian ideas and
applied them in his class over a few weeks.  The emphasis was on discipline, order, and community.  Soon most of the class
had become miniature fascists, unaware of how much their behavior had become like those of Germany pre WW2, till the
teacher showed them dramatically what they had become.  This film, unlike the 45 minute American drama, runs over 90
minutes and takes some liberties at the end for dramatic power.  It is very realistic, and the climax is extremely powerful.  I
was conflicted, because this improves on what really happened as far as dramatic storytelling impact, but since it isn't what
really happened, I gave it a 4 instead of 5.  But as a stand alone film, were it an original story, it would get a 5 from me.",1399161600,5,1116,4.663265306122449

The central character in the film is the teacher, who's latest classroom project sees his students creating a faux-totalitarian society within the walls of the school. The walls, however, eventually fail to contain these students, who end up becoming a sort of gang with the good-hearted teacher as their dictator, who is initially unaware of the students' intentions.

For those in the know of how subtle indoctrination can occur, they scream out from the movie to you; to those being indoctrinated, the steps seem quite benign.

This movie is not about a cult, by the way, but rather the political system that cults use:  the group becomes more important than the individual, anecdotal evidence just good enough to gain compliance, us-vs-them, and information control.  A cult would add to these by instilling fears and phobias into the group, as well as an overemphasis on partnering (which is surveillance) and conditioning to submit to leaders; these are not addressed in the movie because, again, this movie is about an experiment in real life that resulted with too many associations with facism.

The speed and relative ease with which this diverse classroom is willing to conform to a hive-mind is suspect, as is the instructor's dull misunderstanding of the stakes.

Most students are inquisitive and eager to participate in the discussion. The next day the class picks a leader and name for their group (the Wave). This is followed by a logo, salute, and uniform of white shirts and blue jeans. Outside of class the ""white shirts"" congregate and protect other group members who are being picked on. At night some members don the community with the Wave logo. A rather rogue member attains a handgun and offers protection to the teacher as rumor has it the other teachers are filled with disdain for the perceived success of the autocracy class. In the end two students are dead when the instructor has announced the class project is over the The Wave is no more.

The directors and actors were authentically successful in demonstrating how a dictatorship could start out small and grow to such popularity based upon the members just wanting to belong to something to feel part of something good in their minds. The process used mimics the Nazi party incrementalism process. That is to start out small and discrete so that people hardly notice, before long the group is so large and powerful it cannot be stopped.

""The Wave"" (2008 release from Germany; 107 min.) captures a (fictitious) social experiment during ""Project Week"", in which a teacher transforms an underachieving and aimless group of kids into a unit eventually called The Wave, where individuality gives way to the betterment of the group. Mind you, the class is called ""autocracy"" and examines the roots of autocracy, and then the class, at the urge of the teacher, acts out on it. Inevitably, things go very wrong. I found this a fascinating movie, in particular since the setting is in Germany, with its long history of failed/doomed autocracy, peaking of course with the Nazi regime. The movie felt very real throughout, all the way through its tragic ending. The acting is superb, as is the script and the direction.

There are a couple of nice, albeit short, DVD bonuses, including an interview with the director as well as with Ron Jones, the US teacher who 'invented' the original ""wave"" experiment in California in the late 60s. In all, this is a terrific movie, with a lot of lessons worth noting. Highly recommended!",1329177600,2,1294,4.721238938053097
3671732,4,B001KW08L8,"I bought this movie because of a friend's recommendation, and from reading some of the Amazon reviews. I found the movie to be great for adults, but would not be good for younger teens.  After watching the movie I read about the original experiment in Palo Alto, CA, and discovered the movie's ending was made up.  But, having said that, I really liked the movie and thought the acting was very good.",1329004800,,400,4.541666666666667
3671733,5,B001KW08L8,"This was a very good film, which actually went much further than the American version of the same film did.  Usually, it follows the American version fairly closely, with some added bits and German cultural equivalents.  Be prepared to be shocked at the end, however.  I won't say any more about it than has been said.  I think it suffices.  But I was very moved by this film, and circumstances like this really could happen (have happened, many times over) -- anywhere, any time.",1327017600,2,480,4.666666666666667
3671734,4,B001KW08L8,"This movie is based on the book ""The Wave"" which was inspired by the social experiment ""The Third Wave"".  In the book this scenario takes place in a factious high school in the US.  It is, however, based on a true story that took place in California.  This movie ""Die Welle"" (The Wave) is set in a German high school which makes it very intriguing as they experiment with the idea of social conformity and whether Nazi ideals and influence could happen again.  Not possible, or is it?

Movie is done really well with the exception of a few trivial errors in editing.  Slow start and sound effects can be a bit annoying, but very good story.  The main actor, Jrgen Vogel, does an excellent performance as Rainer and his character keeps the movie viewer on edge because one is not sure how or if he will end this project.

3671735,4,B001KW08L8,"How do you relate to an unthinkable heritage? It is easy enough to embrace and celebrate the heroic struggles that define one's cultural or national identity, but is it enough to label the evils as such in order to safely relegate them to the past?

In Dennis Gansel's film The Wave (Die Welle) a likeable but unorthodox German high school teacher sets out to demonstrate to his students that fascism is still possible, and finds his experiment to be more successful than even he had predicted. Rainer, who had been planning to teach a course on anarchism and punk rock, is assigned to teach a special module on fascism and autocracy. Confronted with the apathy of students who find the topic both irrelevant and done to death, he decides to try another approach: he shows them firsthand just how appealing a regime based on order, unity and discipline can be.

As the students' fascination with dictatorial techniques of social control leads to their enthusiastic participation, the newly established community takes on a life of its own that grows dangerously out of control. The film is based on a true&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/story/dp/0440993717/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">story</a>&nbsp;of a teacher in California who, at the peak of the social upheaval in the 70's, wanted to show his students how Nazi Germany and the horrors of Auschwitz could come to be. The genius of the film - which manages to be thoroughly engaging and fun to watch at the same time as it raises important questions - is in its seamless adaptation of this story to a very different time and place, showing how easily the universal need for acceptance and desire to belong to something important can be perverted into a system that promotes hatred of the nonconformist and of the outsider.",1323129600,3,1819,5.141891891891892
3671736,5,B001KW08L8,"""The wave"" Die welle"" is an allegoric movie that displays through a very thoughtful and smart script the burning ashes of a tormented collective conscious. As part of  a weekly project of his class, the professor Rainer Wenger (Jurgen Vogel) habitual in the German schools  - Projektweche- decides to undertake the issue of the autocracy and so proposes an experiment in order to be able to explain his pupils the functioning of the Totalitarian Regimes. The proposal is a provocative game of roles beginning with the discipline and community as fundamental pillars. But just at the middle of the week, the things begin to get out of control with unthinkable consequences, when the members of ""The Wave"" decide to maintain and preserve this radical movement.

This monumental and original script carves sin relief the fascism resides in our souls like an invisible gene, waiting just for a ring bell to make its appearance. The parable is by itself an interesting anti myth, we have to pay for the feeding dreams that inspire us and at the same time, to learn these heroic dreams can forge into our bestiality and blood shedding unpredictable monsters from our own.

In this sense the film has a close affinity with two films of 2001: the best film of that year directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel ""The experiment""  and the winner film of Sundance Festival in the same year ""The true believer"" .

An absorbing, tense and formidable film that will maintain you hold to your seat from the very start until its powerful end.

You must not miss this overwhelming movie, directed by the talented filmmaker Dennis Gansel.",1289260800,,1611,4.8791208791208796
3671737,4,B001KW08L8,"This film was PERFECT for me to use to bring the story of the classroom experiment known as The Wave up to date.  The young people in the film are certainly a rougher breed in general and the language is really rough for American audiences.  But the lessons of the story are valuable.  It was pretty predictable and the time was compressed so much that it seemed hard to believe that the transformation would take place so quickly.  Nevertheless, this is a quality film that has a powerful message.",1287792000,2,498,4.561797752808989
3671738,5,B001KW08L8,"A movie about what it is really like How Hitler manipulated and brain washed his  followers the Nazis. It explores teachers and students in a public high school. The teacher trains them by demanding things he wants. For instance he will say evreybody walk around and then in a comanding voice say stop he would time the students and make sure they do it more quickly use slogans and catch phrases such as strength community leadership. This was in essence a reinactment of, how hitler manipulated his followers. This film is very powerful and shows how we can also fall into this category, If we are not careful we can commit th Heinous crimes that the Nazis commited. This is a true story it really happened not the same people because these are actors but definitely the same concepts.",1287100800,,787,4.661870503597123
