4513364,1,B00507IBTA,"It was a good soap when I watched bits and pieces on tv when the soap was going on. But I didn't watch it when I bought the dvd because I notice after I open it that I was a three disc set, instead of the one I wanted that was the five disc set.",1320710400,,245,3.4727272727272727
4513365,4,B00507IBTA,"Estoy Esperando con Ansias el Lanzamiento de esta Telenovela, Me Gusta Mucho Ariadne Diaz y Valentino Lanus, hacen una Exelente Pareja en Llena de Amor y ademas es una Bonita Historia.
Ojala el Dvd Incluya la Segunda Entrada de la Novela que esta mucho mejor que la Primera, aunque lo mas seguro es que tenga la Entrada 1 ya que fue con la que se inicio la Historia de Marianela, pero bueno aun no pierdo las esperanzas jeje.
Me Encanta la Cancion de Luis Fonsi, Llena de Amor, es un Hermoso Tema.
Ojala el Dvd tenga lo Mas Importante, las Mejores Escenas ya que la Novela fue Muy Larga, mas de 200 Capitulos y al parecer estara resumida en Aproximadamente 12 Hs, espero que hayan hecho un buen trabajo de Edicion, es lo menos que esperamos para poder Disfrutarla Al Maximo.
Cuando la Compre, Tenga y Vea les cuento que tal esta...
23/10/2011: Me Encanto el Dvd, Muy Buen Resumen, si bien le faltan muchas Escenas ya que fue una Telenovela Muy Larga, tiene coherencia, se entiende y se puede seguir perfectamente el hilo de la Historia.
Es una Exelente Historia, Muy Dinamica y con Mucha Adrenalina, te mantiene muy entretenido. Realmente la Recomiendo, no se van a arrepentir!!!
Ariadne Diaz es Hermosa, Exelente Actriz, se llevo esta Telenovela con su Personaje Protagonico, Valentino Lanus estubo Magnifico, muy buen Actor. Sin Duda Azela Robinson fue una Exelente Villana, como pocas, su Papel Fue Increible y Altair Jarabo muy buena Antagonista.
Si tienen la Oportundiad de Comprar este Dvd haganlo, les aseguro que les va a Encantar.
Contiene la Primera Entrada y los Creditos Finales con el Tema de Luis Fonsi, Llena de Amor.
El Dvd tiene un Resumen de Ms de 12 Horas con las Mejores Escenas.",1310601600,3,1699,4.723905723905724
4513376,2,B00507IBTA,"Series is very nice, but too cut series and in 3 disks is not enough, there are beautiful and important scenes which do not appear and the plot is a little lost.",1433376000,,161,4.0625
4513377,1,B00507IBTA,Overall I noticed that there were several scenes missing from the TV series. It was incomplete and took away the understanding of certain episodes.,1425081600,,147,5.166666666666667
4513378,3,B00507IBTA,I hate that this is missing the whole show. It's a terribly spliced together edit of the whole show with English Subs. But if you are desperate for Eng Subs to complete the serial (like I was) go ahead and buy it.,1415577600,,213,4.095238095238095

4513380,4,B00507IBTA,I'm using this novela for my Spanish 3 class. It an end of the week treat. My students are enjoying it and can't wait for Fridays to see what happens next.,1381017600,,155,4.032258064516129
4513381,4,B00507IBTA,"Llena de amor (Filled With Love - 730 minutes) is about a ""gordita"" (little fat girl) who stands to inherit significant wealth if her evil aunt can be thwarted. She has been in a girls' school, so sees her primo (cousin) for the first time since childhood. They had always been best friends and she has had a crush on him all her life. Now HE feels it too.

Problem is, he's engaged to a supermodel (aren't these fun!) AND they are first cousins. Besides, the aunt is slowly poisoning our heroine. She goes to Spain to live with a relative for two years, leaving our hero to agree to a platonic marriage with the supermodel while our heroine loses 80 pounds!

Of course when she returns no one recognizes her (she was mad at him when she left, so refused his letters, his emails and his text messages, which was why he got married).

This has it all, goofy plot twists, unrequited (then requited) love, dastardly villains and absurd situations. I liked it because of the actor who played the ""primo"" (cousin) Valentino Lans. He's in ""Las Tontas..."" too. I got my DVD from Amazon and LOVE it!

By the way, watch it a second time. It's even BETTER!",1366934400,5,1146,4.442857142857143
4513382,4,B00507IBTA,"It was great I loved it but I only rated a 4 as not all the good epidodes were in the DVS and all the episodes jumped to different scenes but it was easy to follow and to figure out what was going on.
If you are a telenovela fan I highly recommend to watch Llena de Amor!",1350777600,5,271,3.689655172413793

4513384,5,B00507IBTA,"I saw this telenovella on a Spanish-language television channel, but there were no English subtitles.  Thankfully this DVD-set does have English subtitles.  It is a cute, romantic, funny soap opera.  The actors are great.  It has the usual intrigue, missed opportunities, and a wonderful lady villain.  The only draw-back is this is just a ""best episodes"" set.  I wish it had had all the episodes.",1334188800,,397,5.030769230769231

8450802,1,B00507IBTA,"I hope people will be smart and read all the reviews,before buying this product. Unfortunately i did not. I was soo excited when i bought this dvd but very dissapointed when it arrived and started to watch it. I realized it was missing important scenes. I think maybe even full episodes. They cut out parts even making it hard to follow the novela. Soo sad. I guess i will just have to keep watching the full episodes on youtube. Poor quality but at least its all there.",1460678400,4,470,4.413793103448276
8450803,1,B00507IBTA,"Very disappointed
The dvd cut multiple scenes. It's not the entire series",1458000000,,73,5.166666666666667
8450804,1,B00507IBTA,"I ordered this telenovela. Last year..And at frist when it came i was so excited  to put the DVD in my DVD player...so upon seeing all the CD'S I noticed  that it doeant play the hole movies it skips episodes. Which really it wasn't want i paid for at all..i hate it when you buy something such as a movie.electronic, games ETC.and. its not what u expect  at ALL. (DON'T ORDER THIS MOVIES ) unless u want to get Ripped Off..",1457568000,,424,4.209876543209877
8450805,3,B00507IBTA,The episodes were not complete and story lines were cut out.,1446422400,,60,4.545454545454546
8450806,1,B00507IBTA,"Not worth the money. It's not the complete series and it's not even in order. There's a lot of episodes missing in between and the few that are on the disks are edited, which makes it confusing to follow the storyline. The company that put this together should be embarrassed for doing so such crappy job, which is sad because I like this novela and was excited to watch it again when I bought the DVDs.",1438300800,2,403,4.315789473684211
