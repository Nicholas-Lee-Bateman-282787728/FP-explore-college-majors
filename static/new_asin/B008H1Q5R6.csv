8527843,4,B008H1Q5R6,This doctor provides information that I have not found in other books dealing with hyper tension and other illnesses we seniors face.  Our son turned us on to this book and we are grateful for the info.,1424304000,2,202,4.45945945945946

My PCP recommended this book. He thinks he made a mistake because now I beat him up with questions.",1420848000,,181,3.918918918918919
8527845,4,B008H1Q5R6,The information inthe Book is not aonly usefull but simple for understanding. A lot of new concepts on personal caretaking and some disrruptive criteria on what one consider to be right thing to do and eat and drink.,1398038400,3,216,4.7105263157894735
8527846,5,B008H1Q5R6,Very good  5 star. The Information is not same old thing we hear all the time. My doctor recommended it. Very useful info.,1378080000,3,122,4.304347826086956
8527847,2,B008H1Q5R6,"IMHO, Dr. Agus appears to be trying to sell his book, which I have not read.  As far as the DVD is concerned, there is little substance to it and quite a bit of innuendo.  For instance, to prove a point, he cites a study from 1953 on heart disease to prove one of his premises.  The study lists the difference in initial instance of heart disease between drivers (inactive) and ticket takers (active) and is shown in rate per 1000.  The TTs had almost 1 per 1000 and the Drivers has less than 2 per 1000.  1/1000 is hardly a significant finding and why couldn't he find a more recent study?  The assumption has to be that there are none?
the next example is even worse.  the study is from 1932 and is showing Coronary Heart Disease in heavy and light workers.  It is listed in death rates per million, with the highest rate being 1000 per million and the rest are even lower. Again, this is 1/1000 or less and along with the age of the study is hardly a statistic upon which to base a huge lifestyle change today.
On the other hand, when he makes many of his own claims, he usually does not cite studies to prove what he says will work.
On the surface, I did not find the DVD at all enlightening.  Perhaps you could check the book out of the library to see if it has any useful information.",1375315200,5,1290,4.190283400809717
8527848,5,B008H1Q5R6,I am sure it is a wonderful book but i find reading discs difficult and not very much fun. So I have read very little of it.,1365724800,4,124,3.6296296296296298
