8272125,4,6305120722,"I've been doing a thorough research on different handguns, as I'm getting close to buying one of my own.  As much as I've found out, I was pretty sure I was missing a lot of things that are crucial when it comes to  finding out which one was right for me.  The Manstoppers video was a great  help to me.  It got into the several factors that I wasn't too sure about  and what I could not find in books and on the Net.  Different safeties,  trigger pull...they even introduced how easy it is for someone to grab at  the pistol and fire back, hadn't really given that too much thought. I was  also glad to get a little bit more background on the 10mm round, which I  had a hard time getting info about to begin with.  However, this video was  made a few years ago.  And just like computers, handguns have been evolving  so the newer handguns that I was looking at weren't on the video.  Also,  there wasn't as wide a variety of handguns compared as I thought.  However,  most of the handguns from a certain manufacturer share the same qualities  so I'm not too concerned. It is still a great video and it's price is worth  it in preventing you from blowing off a large amount of money on a pistol  that you may end up not liking.",964742400,,1227,4.198275862068965
