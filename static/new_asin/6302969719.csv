7832636,4,6302969719,"Two early short film directed by Martin Scorsese.

ITALIANAMERICAN (1974; 49 minutes) Documentary in which Scorsese interviews his parents, Catherine and Charles, about their lives and family histories. This is a charming film that anyone interested in Scorsese should enjoy, and is as important to understanding his sensiblity, in its way, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raging-Bull/dp/0792833236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raging Bull</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Driver-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0767830555/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Driver (Collector's Edition)</a>, if not more so. Plus, you get Mrs. Scorsese's recipe for marinara sauce! (NOT, as some reviewers have stated, her recipe for meatballs.) My rating: 4 stars (out of 5).

THE BIG SHAVE (1967; 6 minutes) A nightmarish film that is believed to be Scorsese's commentary on America's involvement in the then-current Vietnam War. Piquant and disturbing, if not overly subtle (though I doubt it was intended to be). The reference to ""whiteness"" in the closing credits is an allusion to Melville's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Moby-Dick-Dover-Giant-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486432157/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Moby-Dick (Dover Giant Thrift Editions)</a>. My rating: 4 1/2 stars (out of 5).

Note: I think both of these films have been uploaded to YouTube if the VHS tape is not an option for you (or if you're trying to save some dough).",1303084800,,1553,7.2063492063492065
7832637,4,6302969719,"Four and a half stars actually. A documentary classic for sure, from one of America's most important filmmakers. The choice to interview his own parents pays off big time, as they're willing to get much more personal with Martin than they would with a stranger. The interaction between mother and father in front of the son, who's already a longtime participant in their relationship, and who they're already accustomed to pointing cameras at things, is as natural and honest as you're likely to get. The recipe, the stories, the threat on the cameraman's life: Classic. Of Scorsese's shorts, only American Boy with Freddy Prince gets a higher rating from me; and why is that not part of one of these DVD boxed sets? Release it already, what are'ya waitin for!?!",1145404800,2,762,4.869230769230769
7832638,5,6302969719,"If you think the attitudes, humor, and plastic covered sofas were limited to Italian American immigrants, you are sadly mistaken.  Anyone who grew up as first generation Americans with parents who immigrated (legally) during the 40's and 50's will relate to Scorsese's affectionate look at that generation.

If you enjoyed the mom in Goodfellas, who cooks up a big dinner ""snack"" for Pesci and his pals at 2 in the morning, that's Scorsese's mother playing herself, featured here in this documentary.

As nutty as it was growing up in a European immigrant household in the 60's and 70's, those who did so will forever share a common bond, and this documentary will make you smile.  If you didn't have the pleasure, but you enjoy the kooky parental observations Jerry Seinfeld made on his show, you'll enjoy this too.",1125187200,,816,4.891304347826087

Italianamerican is a Short flim/Non-Fiction Bio about his  lovley Mother(Who has been in more then a few Scorsese movies) and Father,  Who immagrated from Italy to the big apple and had a hard  ""working-class"" life. Easy to relate too. Mama Scorsese reminds  me of my mother.",924998400,4,413,4.616438356164384
