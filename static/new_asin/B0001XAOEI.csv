8017902,4,B0001XAOEI,"I was a huge BB fan when I was in elementary school. I had pretty much every single Berenstein Bear book and VHS tape produced up until about 1996. I have to agree with some reviewers that I preferred the voices in the old tapes to these new ones, but it's just matter of what you're used to. That being said, my 4 and 5 year old boys love the new version, and I love the morals/values they pick up from each episode.",1332892800,,417,4.036144578313253
