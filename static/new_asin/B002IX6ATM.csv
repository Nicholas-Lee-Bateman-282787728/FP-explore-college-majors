8477273,5,B002IX6ATM,"The Ancient Wisdoms must be passed on to us somehow. Ancient China had forms of exercise and self defense which included various palm techniques. Two branches of palm strategies are 1. Ba Gua (Eight Diagram palm) which some say was originally called Turning Palms. 2. Buda Palm which is said to evolved from Shaolin and is used in arts like Choy Li Fut.

Palms are palms, you say. There is a difference from style to style in how the palms are used and the attitude in which the warrior combats using the palm techniques. For example: A Ba Gua warrior thinks in terms of finesse, how to deflect or suppress the enemy attacks, how to sneak over, under or around the attacks to counter strike with a thundering palm to the enemy. A Choy Li Fut warrior thinks in terms of an experienced street fighter who will pound the attackers' arms down or to the side to clear the way for a lightning strike to the enemy.

Ba Gua Types of Palms vary greatly.
With respect to the Hand. Open hand, closed fist, tiger claw, monkey wrist.
With respect to your body. Lift up, press down, expand away, retract in, press right, press left, circle vertical up-down-left-right, and circle horizontal left and right.
With respect to action. Pushing, pulling, gripping, thrusting, swinging, spinning, pounding and avoiding.
With respect to each other (double palms). Side by side, lead, follow, expand in opposite directions, contract inward, twist and cross over-under.
With respect to combat. Covering (in close block), repulsing (pushing attack away), deflecting (glancing blow), redirecting (to specific direction), suppressing (preventing attack), hitting (fast strike), thrusting (push hard), grasping (stop attacker), slapping (palm block or strike), Chopping (edge of hand), whipping (bullwhip type strike), pulling in (close distance), grappling (control enemy).

This video includes all 64 palms of linear Ba Gua. There are eight short forms, each with 8 palm techniques. Each palm technique is employed with a specific step, shuffle or turn to add power.
The video starts with a demonstration of full Ba Gua 64 palm linear form at normal speed.
Then it flows into the first set of 8. Demonstrating at normal speed, followed by a very slow walk through-talk through of each individual palm, progressing sequentially through each of the 8 palms.  Next, a combat explanation of each of the 8 palms in the first set. Various assistant instructors attack slowly while the instructor talks you through the palm technique to counter the attack.
Then on to the other sets. Each of the 8 forms containing 8 palms each are demonstrated and explained very thoroughly. It is very easy to follow along with. The English subtitles are easy to read. However, I am mainly following along with the movements and will read more of the details as I get better.

The instructor Master Zhang Quan Liang is a very good teacher and has a gentle way of explaining Ba Gua (Eight Diagram palm).",1280966400,5,2954,4.959595959595959
