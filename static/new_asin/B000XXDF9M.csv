Actually I had never seen Jet Harris or Liquorice Locking on stage previously so that was a surprising extra bonus, and the full concert with whispering Marty Wilde was truly engaging.",1481068800,,254,4.906976744186046
8230243,5,B000XXDF9M,"Pretty much unknown to U.S. audiences, Marty Wilde was one of the crop of post-Tommy Steele/pre-Beatles British teen idols. As far as look and style go, Wilde was closer to Cliff Richard and Pat Boone than to -- can I say it? -- legitimately wild rockers. The closest he came to a hit in the States was ""Bad Boy,"" which lost some momentum to a cover version by Robin Luke. Which is ironic in that many of Wilde's hits were covers of U.S. hits.

""Born to Rock 'n' Roll"" was filmed at the London Palladium on May 27, 2007, the final date of his 50th anniversary tour

Segments of the 135-minute show are devoted to tributes to Billy Fury, Cliff Richard and the Six Five Special TV show; guest performers include several Shadows: three numbers by Jet Harris (whose between-songs patter is quite funny); and, in various combinations, Hank B. Marvin, Bruce Welch, Brian Bennett and Brian ""Licorice"" Locking -- Bennett and Locking were Wildcats before being drafted tby Cliff, as was Big Jim Sullivan, who shows up for ""Bad Boy."" Other guests include the Moody Blues' Justin Hayward (another former Wildcat) on a duet of Nights in White Satin; and Wilde's daughters, Kim and Roxanne, both of whom look and sound terrific. Yet with all this going on, the show flows smoothly and (thanks in part to some rather clumsy editing) never seems cluttered.

Included are numerous UK hits for Wilde, in full-length versions (no medlies), including Jezebel, Endless Sleep, Sea of Love, Rubber Ball, Little Girl, Donna, Danny (aka Lonely Blue Boy), and Tomorrow's Clown, which he says he wrote for Roy Roy Orbison.

The second disc, also a bit more than two hours long, is largely devoted to interviews with several of the participants.

Evidently not region-coded, the PAL-formatted discs looked and sounded great on my Region 1 Blu-ray player (the discs are not Blu-ray) .",1479945600,,1856,4.80564263322884
8230244,5,B000XXDF9M,"Absolutely fantastic.  Worth every cent. Marty Wilde has still got what it takes after all these years, it is like stepping back to the 60's. How can he still have the voice and energy fifty years on? Terrific to see the Shadows and Jet Harris invited to take part in the show and together again on the same stage.  Highly entertaining.

8230245,5,B000XXDF9M,"Fantastic performance from Marty Wilde.
 The guy sounds exactly the same as he did in 1957,marvellous voice,and he still looks the same,
maybe a little older.
 His two daughters Kim & Roxanne perform with Jet Harris ,Brien Bennet .Hank B Marvin
and the legendary Wildcats.
