1982903,4,B00019U4QA,"I gave this book to my 22-year-old son for his birthday. I love the clear descriptions of the poses, the photographs, and the layout of the book in general. I also like the upbeat, youthful approach of Mr. Baptiste.",1221782400,,215,4.538461538461538
1982904,3,B00019U4QA,"I love Baron and I should preface this review by saying I have considerable Power Yoga experience, though I'm far from expert. I also have to work within some physical limitations.

That said, I found this video far too slow and disjointed and, as one reviewer said, too easy even for beginners. It had no flow like you expect in vinyasa yoga.

I would say that if you need to learn the very basic poses this would be a good video. But if you want a short practice that flows, this is not a good video for you.

I would suggest a Bryan Kest video or most any other Baron Baptiste videos. But just not this one.

I enjoy short practices and Rodney Yee, Bryan Kest and even Baron have some very good ones. I would pass on this unless you are a real novice and need to understand the basic poses.",1160438400,67,793,4.197368421052632
1982905,4,B00019U4QA,"I think is a great yoga dvd. It is a worthwhile substitute to attending a Baron Baptiste yoga class. While the instruction is superb I still find there are a few flaws with the DVD. The instruction assumes that you have an understanding of how to assume the poses, as well as the ability to do them correctly.

This is not a DVD for the total beginner, who has no knowledge or experience of yoga. There is no accompanying instruction or breakdown on the postures. I think someone entirely new to yoga would be lost trying to follow this program. Also there are a few minor mistakes in the instruction that might confuse the viewer.

If you have no experience or undestanding of yoga I suggest you first try the Yoga Zone DVDs which have slower instruction and repeat the steps for each pose so you can see how they are done. I also suggest for the complete beginner to attend a yoga class to get at least a foundation on yoga postures and learn the proper way to do them.

Though I don't think this DVD is easy for the total beginner, I think those with a basic knowledge of yoga would greatly enjoy it. It moves quickly and flowingly. It is not slow and sedative like some of the yoga DVDs out there. It keeps a quick pace that is easy to follow and does not bore you or let your mind wander.

It is definitely good for strength and stamina building without being too challenging. I consider this to be one of the best yoga DVDs Baron Baptiste has done.",1146700800,37,1454,4.315018315018315
1982906,5,B00019U4QA,"I have a very extensive Yoga DVD/Video collection (over 80 and counting). Out of all of them, Baron is definitely my overall favorite teacher, hands down!

 This program is a 30 minute, moderate intensity vinyasa flow. It  is similar in intensity with Baron's ""Unlocking Athletic Power"" and ""Core Power"" programs in terms of length and difficulty. It's slightly more intense (mostly just by virtue of being 10 minutes longer) than his ""Power Yoga Basics"" program which is found on his ""Transform Your Life, Yoga With Baron Baptiste"" which was originally aired on PBS.

 This ""Journey Into Power"" Level 1 program is very well rounded, has clear instruction and a nice overall feel to it. It's a class setting so you get to see lots of different ways of doing the poses.

 Baron has a wonderful approach in that students should use their intuition to approach the poses at their own level of ability or energy level on any given day. You should go to your own personal ""edge"" without going into overwhelm.

 I've been doing Yoga daily for over 7 years and found this DVD very useful for a shorter practice. My 12 year old football playing son has worked with Baron's programs and has gotten tremendous benefits from them (and did this particular DVD this morning) and my wife who is fairly new to yoga jumped right in to this program and has really enjoyed it and is making wonderful progress in strength and flexibility after only doing it for about 4 or 5 days. She also loves Baron's approach which is not intimidating even though she still finds it challenging enough to make her feel like she's getting benefits from it.

  I hope this review helps those who are interested in trying a vinyasa (flow) based style of yoga, those curious about Baron as a teacher in particular  or those who may be familiar with Baptise Power Vinyasa Yoga but are looking for a shorter practice to mix in with their other programs.

 Namaste",1123545600,146,1925,4.6875
1982907,3,B00019U4QA,"This DVD is the first real Yoga I have ever done, and although it was relaxing, I found it far too easy and only used this DVD once.  I bought it one along with the Level 2 and went straight into the Level 2 after that.

I do have a somewhat athletic background, and/but am naturally very inflexible and not the best at balance. Coming from that background, although I enjoyed this DVD I personally found it too easy.",1115510400,28,417,4.265822784810126
1982908,2,B00019U4QA,"I'm sure this is a great tape for yoga enthusiasts, but it's way too hard for real beginners.  I do aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes a day, so I'm not a complete couch potato.  I thought I could use some strengthening and stretching exercises, so I bought this program.  The trouble is that there's no working up to the positions  -- it's all or nothing, and if you're not strong or flexible enough to hold the position, down you go.  I found it really, really hard.  I could manage less than half the positions.  Since each flows into the next, you don't get to stop and try less advanced versions.  I hate to think what the advanced programs are like!  I also have a small quarrel with the outside of the package, which says that the participants are of ""all body types.""  That would be both slim and strong, and very slim and strong.  There are no pudgy real beginners on this tape.  For instance, if you're a woman who can't already do a number of full-body push-ups (no touching your knees to the floor!), you won't get through this tape. I think this would be a good program for people who've already done considerable yoga or strength training.  But it's not for beginners.",1103673600,24,1182,4.4672897196261685
1982909,5,B00019U4QA,This video is great for the beginners and the advanced beginners.  I started taking a Vinyasa class and was unable to coordinate my schedule with class times so I looked for a video to supplement my practice at home.  What a great choice.  Baron Baptiste takes his time to explain the poses and provides the mood that is needed to practice yoga at home.  I highly recommend this DVD.,1082592000,27,383,4.507246376811594
1982929,3,B00019U4QA,"I have been doing yoga for several years and thought I would do this video when I could not attend class. After doing the video once I am conflicted as to how I would classify it. The pace was definitely for a beginner and I felt the instruction was well suited. I felt it odd that Camel Pose was a part of the sequence, definitely not a beginner pose.

This was my first Baptiste DVD, guess I expected a little more since it is entitled Power Vinyasa Yoga. I didn't feel the power.",1425254400,,482,4.182795698924731

I got this one for the great reviews but I just finished doing it and is not great like those reviwers said.

I finally wore out my VHS tape version of it and immediately reordered the DVD version.  Easy to follow, some modifications of the poses given, and a traditional abdominal strengthening exercise series that you don't usually get in a yoga class.  I have made a few modifications on my own; I do the back bend poses on a large physio ball or I just do a bridge pose.  Also, I modify the straight leg lowering exercises only to a place where I can keep my low back firmly into the mat.",1402790400,,593,4.221238938053097

1982953,2,B00019U4QA,"I realize this is a Level 1 yoga video, but it was really basic.

I will use this video on days I don't feel like doing very much.",1359158400,,332,4.203125

1982977,5,B00019U4QA,I have quite a few of Baron Baptiste's yoga DVDs and books and I have worked from some of his books in the past. His books are detailed and easy to follow and he also warns you about positions where you need to be careful with lining up. I would love to go on one of his yoga retreats one day.,1355184000,,293,3.819672131147541

1982991,5,B00019U4QA,"I really enjoy this DVD!  I am NOT a spiritual person at all, and I don't want my morning workout interspersed with a hundred comments about qi, flow, chakras, or whatever else.  This DVD is perfect for someone that enjoys the physical aspects of yoga, but without all the fluff.

This DVD is also great for beginners that have only the barest knowledge of the yoga poses or their traditional names.  Thankfully, Baron Baptiste recognizes that few people are familiar with the English names of yoga poses, let alone the Sanskrit names (I hate you Shiva Rea).  He explains each pose clearly and how to transition between them, how to structure your breathing, and gives modifications if the pose is too strenuous.  He provides little bursts of encouragement without going overboard, saying things like ""this is so healthy!"" and ""You want to be strong/build your strength!""

The routine itself is not difficult, but definitely does the job.  At around 30 minutes it's short enough that I can do it in the morning before work (without wanting to die later), but provides a great workout for my arms/shoulders and legs.  After two weeks (3-4 times per week) I am MUCH more flexible and I am gaining strength in my arms.  I'm looking forward to Level 2!",1339718400,3,1248,4.7627906976744185

1982993,1,B00019U4QA,I found his form of vinyasa not very flowy slow and boring. If you want something more true to Vinyasa this is not the video.,1327276800,2,125,4.04
1982994,4,B00019U4QA,"It's not a fancy video, but it is a good one.  It is a short review of basic yoga poses.  This video is most helpful for those just starting out in their practice. The only thing in the video is all of the shirtless pasty men in the video, but quality of the instruction makes up for it.",1325462400,,287,3.9310344827586206
1982995,5,B00019U4QA,"Just what I was looking for! This video is my favorite in my collection, the way Baptiste takes you through the moves ans allows you to get lost in your practice is perfect for any level.",1319241600,,187,4.222222222222222
1982996,4,B00019U4QA,"I was able to preview Baron Baptiste when one of his yoga instructional videos was available for streaming on Netflix. He by far has been the most impressive tutor I've seen to date.  This I feel is due to his concentration on the Vinyasa style of yoga as opposed to the Hatha or Pilates-hybrid varations so prevelent in the market and gym.  He also trusts in the process of the yoga unlike the biggest loser and boot camp flavors of yoga program.

This is a video I can recommend to my mother who has had back problems for over a decade.  You are in power over your movement and can make it as intense or light as possible. I will continue to purchase Baron Baptiste videos as I reaquaint myself with my love of yoga.",1319155200,,718,4.296296296296297
1982997,2,B00019U4QA,"Not impressed. I've been to a few classes at one of Baron's studios and really enjoyed it, but this DVD doesn't quite do it for me. It's only 30 minutes, and for the price it feels like a rip off. I've spent less for DVDs with longer routines, or multiple 30 minute routines, and been happier. I'm new to yoga - definitely a beginner, and this STILL wasn't anything new and there was zero challenge.
I expected more.",1318204800,4,416,4.346153846153846
1982998,4,B00019U4QA,"This is a nice presentation of some of the basic poses, and it's not very expensive.  But it doesn't really amount to a workout.  So if you want to review some basic poses at home once in a while, this DVD is fine for that.  But this isn't really something to get if you want to follow along for a home yoga class on a regular basis.",1317945600,,333,3.9402985074626864
1983009,5,B00019U4QA,"I've done yoga off and on over the years and don't consider myself very advanced.  I have several of Baron's workouts as well as several others by Rodney Yee and Shiva Rea.  I've owned this DVD for years and this is the one I like to do most often.  The ab workout is awesome.  I'm male and sometimes find, for me, that some workouts will over-emphasize the legs until I feel like my thighs are about to catch on fire and my femurs to snap in two.  This one does not.  My problem area is more my core so this workout is right for me.  It does hit your legs as well as stretching you from head to toe.  It's a well-balanced workout.  After letting myself get pretty out of shape, I've gotten back into doing yoga recently and have been doing this workout almost every morning for about a month and have dropped significant weight, gained much more flexibility and feel much more energized.  I guess I have indeed elevated my altitude of attitude.  Now if I can just keep doing yoga once I get where I want to be.

I've noticed a lot of complaints of this ""beginner's"" workout as well as from other yoga teachers who have workouts for beginners.  The complaint is usually that it is too tough for a real beginner.  I would say that anyone who is truly a beginner, has never done yoga and possibly out of shape, don't try a whole workout right away - from anyone.  Maybe if you are already a practicing athlete only.  First work on stretching until you have some flexibility.  Maybe find a DVD only on stretching.  Otherwise you are probably going to hurt yourself.  Then learn some of the basic poses until you can do them without falling over and have decent form.  Then eventually do parts of a whole workout.  It might be helpful to find a teacher to show you the basic poses so you know your form is OK.  It's a little difficult to really know what you look like when you do a downward dog and if you really are close to an inverted ""v"" for example.  Once you are ready for a whole yoga workout, this one is an excellent start.

Baron seems like a really pleasant guy, too.  I like how he explains how you can alter many of these poses to make them simpler if you want.  Baron also explains the poses well enough that you don't have to watch the TV to understand what he is doing after you've gone through it a few times.  That is really important while you are doing a workout.

If you want mind blowing scenery, incredible production, exotic locations and a more metaphysical type approach, a Shiva Rea DVD is pretty amazing. But I found I needed to work with Baron before I could keep up with Shiva.  And you don't really watch the DVD that much while you are doing a workout anyway.",1315440000,4,2688,4.298804780876494
1983010,5,B00019U4QA,"I absolutely cannot witness for or praise Baron Baptiste and his method of teaching Yoga enough.  Baptiste Yoga is a powerful tool.

Yoga has helped strengthen my back and keep me from having back surgery.",1313366400,,366,4.671875
1983011,4,B00019U4QA,"This DVD is exactly at the beginner's level as it stated.  However, if you've never taken a Vinyansa Yoga class, I recommend you do so in order to familiarize yourself with the poses and to make corrections or improvements on such with an instructor prior do starting a practice at home.  Form is very important and I feel without an instructor physically being there, at first, can lead you to poor performance. That being said, I highly recommend it.  I use it to supplement for those days I don't feel like going to the gym; at the very least I get some physical stimulation.",1290729600,,578,4.538461538461538

He has had some back pain associated with a compression fracture.  Our massuese said to try and incorporate some yoga into our life to help him stretch and lengthen.  We love this DVD, his voice is very relaxing and he flows very well from one move to the next.  He also explains the moves well as we are beginners.  We watched it first and then had to watch a couple times while doing it.  Now I can understand what he means and just flow into it without needing to watch the screen.  It is about 30 min long which is perfect for us as we do it when we get home from work.  Helps relieve the tensions of the day and settle us for a nice evening.",1270684800,,795,4.077419354838709

1983014,3,B00019U4QA,"I attended two classes of power-yoga in the spring, never having had any experience with yoga before.  I loved it.  I think yoga is the ultimate workout.  It got my heart rate up enough to qualify for aerobic, but it also builds strength, flexibility, balance, concentration, good breathing habits, and on and on.  I checked out one of Baron's books at the library and really enjoyed, so decided to buy one of his videos.  I was disappointed in the video.  It's not a bad video, but I don't care for the format.  I prefer an individual instructing alone and demonstrating poses, but Baron filmed this in one of his classes.  Throughout the video he walks around the room critiquing and correcting postures.  He is very positive and upbeat, but not very instructional.  I want a video where I don't have to constantly be looking at the video to do the exercise.  I want verbal instruction in addition to the visual.  This is not a bad video, but if you want to know more about Baron and his brand of yoga, I suggest buying one of his books.",1255564800,,1039,4.497326203208556
1983015,5,B00019U4QA,"I think this is one of the very best programs for the beginner.  I tried others but this one is really special, really down to earth and doesn't make me feel bad for not being able to go fully into the poses. Very gentle and inspiring.  I do it several times a week and just love it!",1251417600,,283,3.9473684210526314
1983016,5,B00019U4QA,"The first thing that I realized is Baron's voice is very calming.  He comes across as caring and is very subtle.  I never felt rushed or pushed only supported and encouraged!  ""Lifting the corners of the mouth""

He takes time to explain every move, breaking it down in extras on the DVD, and shows you the best way to perform the poses with modifications and allows you to get to the end at your own level.

His calm demeanor and his easy listing voice makes you want to come back and practice everyday.

I had done the full Vinyasa Power Yoga workout with Joseph in Tucson, AZ.  Although I enjoyed it very much, it was far too intense for this complete beginner in the humidity and 90 degree heat for 1 1/2 hours.  But, I'm working my way back to the classes and this DVD is taking me there, fast!

This DVD lets me go at my own pace and is great for beginners, allowing you to work your way up from there.

I used to say I felt like I was dying after working out, now I feel like I'm living!

I can't wait to go on to level two.

1983017,5,B00019U4QA,What a great way to get started!  Just the right length of time and complexity for a total novice like myself. I will recommend this to my friends......,1240790400,,152,4.428571428571429
1983018,5,B00019U4QA,"I like the dvd, but found it is too easy for me. I have been doing hatha yoga off and on for years, and tho Baron's style is new to me, this class seems to be for basic beginners. I think for people with no or little experience, it would be a great way to start a yoga practice. I do like his teaching style.",1238284800,,308,3.753846153846154
8008917,1,B00019U4QA,"This tape is horrible, the picture is fuzzy like a child recorded it. There are way to many people in this video; which is distracting for a beginner trying to find the proper positioning. And to be quite honest with you, his cover looks as if it has been photoshopped because he looks a bit out of shape in the video, heavier. That is not motivation for me to put his tape in. Needless to say, it went in the trash but I kept the case to put another DVD in.",1492992000,,458,4.043956043956044

8008919,5,B00019U4QA,"I love Baron Baptiste's yoga DVDs.  This is similar to his his Core Power DVD, but I did not mind this at all because it provides me with a bit of variety.  I have a great many yoga DVDs ( including Eric Schifman, Susan Deason, Travis Eliot, etc.) and find myself coming back to Baron Baptiste's, especially when I am not feeling up to more challenging moves/poses.  I consider this to be a beginner practice.  It is very easy to follow, without being too slow or too fast, and he explains the poses so that you do not find yourself looking up to the screen to see if you are doing them correctly.  The transition from one pose to another is fluid.  So if you are looking for an easy to follow, beginning practice, I would definitely recommend this DVD.",1468886400,4,753,4.3428571428571425

You have to start out gradually because it is difficult.
