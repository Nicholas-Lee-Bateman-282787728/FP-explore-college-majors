6042862,4,B00G0PXU1A,"As far as this goes, it's a worthwhile examination of the repeated pattern that Robert Reich identifies in US economic history: that the widest income gap precedes and apparently precipitates a crash. He describes compares the related graph to a suspension bridge, with the highest peaks in 1929 and 2008.

The sharp increase of the income gap is solely due to the highest-income people claiming that they deserve to pay a lower rate of taxes than everyone else -- and gaming the political system to get their way. They claim to deserve huge tax breaks because they are ""job creators""... However, as one wealthy business owner admits, his money mainly goes into offshore investments, and his own purchases don't support the economy. The most wealth-generating business model in fact results in exporting jobs from the United States.

The reviewer who panned this film, dismissing it as leftist, evidently has not seen it at all. In fact the stats show productivity is higher than at any time in history. However, ordinary people can barely make ends meet. The middle class has tried to compensate for wage stagnation by first of all mothers of families going out to work, then by more borrowing. This has all been to no avail, and instead there are massive losses of homes as well as jobs.

The real engine that drives prosperity is the purchasing power of a large middle class having income to spare for discretionary purchases. As their wages decline (though costs rise), their purchases decline, thus reducing sales and forcing more shutdowns of jobs, etc. in a ""vicious cycle"". Reich's analysis of the contrast between that dismal picture, and what he names the ""virtuous cycle"" that boosts jobs, is enlightening. It would be helpful to have this video and repeat watching these scenes in order better to understand both the problem and proposed solutions.

As far as the film goes it appears well-researched and valid. However, it does not address the issue of the government borrowing money from the privately-owned central banking system known as 'The Fed"". The only dot which can be connected here is Reich mentioning that income tax was first implemented in 1913.

That caught my attention because it's the same year The Fed was established. The Fed's owners are private bankers who rule Washington, apparently through buying elections and politicians on both the 'left' and the 'right'. After 100 years of being governed by this financial system, isn't it time for American people to examine that aspect of their economic history?  (The banking system and debt-based money was not specifically addressed in this film.) If they then decide they don't like the results, what would American voters do to change their situation?",1386460800,235,2734,5.024282560706402
6042863,5,B00G0PXU1A,I saw this movie at the local theater and it was great. Robert Reich put this film together with easy to understand graphs and numbers that were easy to follow. It shows how the wealth distribution is tilted toward the very high income and increasing dramaticly. The top richest 400 people in the USA have as much money as a 150 million people in our country.,1386374400,24,359,4.454545454545454
6042864,5,B00G0PXU1A,"Yesterday, I viewed ""Inequality for All"" on Cape Cod. The screening was shown in a small theatre in the Cape Museum of Fine Arts. Three screenings of the documentary were held. That said, I have always admired the work, mind, and heart of Robert Reich. He may be small in stature, but his heart, soul, and genuine caring for the welfare of all people are HUGE! The statistics presented in the documentary cannot be refuted. As a baby boomer, I well remember the Age of Prosperity enjoyed by the majority of citizens throughout the 50's and into the late 70's. Then the political and economic climate began to erode. The Clinton years saw advancement in our economy, and he left office with a budgetary surplus. As Reich notes, more could have been done at the time. The years since have seen a dramatic decline in our economy on all fronts. The rich have achieved more wealth, the middle class is eroding, and those in poverty have a tough time treading water. One doesn't have to be an economist to realize what has happened. One reviewer noted that raising the minimum wage will do nothing. But not to raise the minimum will advance the status quo and keep far too many people in poverty. We must make changes otherwise I can see uprisings on the horizon. How long before those who suffer at the hands of the wealthy will say, ""I've had enough, and won't take it anymore."" God-willing, we will realize just, moral, and equal access to  life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness for ALL. As Reich suggests, we need to raise the minimum wage, strengthen worker's voices, invest in education, reform Wall Street, fix our tax system and get big money out of politics. Currently, big money buys candidates and puts them in office. Let's face it, poor George Bush was nothing but a puppet of big money. They saw to his election as President, and expected him to do their bidding. Look where it got us. Surplus eroded, unjust, immoral war, our monetary treasure squandered, economic decline,not to mention lives lost and hearts broken.  I plan to buy the DVD and share it with as many who are open to listening and pondering the data. We need to take action NOW.",1386288000,102,2158,4.6171875
6042865,5,B00G0PXU1A,"I just came from the theater.  This film was fantastic.  I am so glad that I saw it and I want everyone to see it.  I'm buying a copy right now.  So many people are angry... The television is filled with the voices of angry people... But the anger comes from not knowing the source of our suffering.  It's not the government, it's not the media -- it's the inequality!!  I feel like Chicken Little - I want to run through the city calling ""TAX THE RICH!! TAX THE RICH!""  I'm married to a Swede, and I can assure you that taxation that creates equal education for all, housing for all, health care for all and so much more results in a society that is a real community, and enjoys a high standard of living - surpassing the United States on almost every index.

He gets his job as Secretary of Labor from an old Oxford University graduate school friend Bill Clinton - cronyism at its finest.  Hey Robert, England gives out Rhodes scholarships to influence our foreign policy.  However, the best of all is that he doesn't understand the economy.  You can't just give money to people to create demand. It may work in the short run to stabilize demand but it doesn't work in the long run and this is why we have all the problems today.

I have been saying the same things for years and years. Outsourcing , big corporate lobbyists and campaign donations that are controlling white house has definitely been pressuring the middle class.  Money is flowing to other countries and not helping the US economy. I am a total capitalist, however, when the negative effects are clearly damaging to a country's economy then some policy changes are needed.

This is a must see for anyone living and working in today's economy.
Unfortunately, the inequality is still here and the gap between the very rich and the almost in-existent middle class is only expanding.
Surprisingly, you can find answers in this movie why Trump got elected, and why the blue-color workers are so unhappy with the status quo.
When the rich are getting so much richer and the middle class is declining, when there is no upward mobility or any prospect of improvement, things are only going to get worst.

6042910,3,B00G0PXU1A,"Robert Reich is a really nice inspiring guy and does an excellent job of showing many of the symptoms and causes of the current capitalist state and economy.  But, like most economists, he doesn't really ask the right questions or dig far enough for root causes.  He is correct to show that ""free trade"", the gutting of unions, growth of technology/robotics, along with deregulation and tax cuts for the rich, have done a number on the value of the average worker.  He shows how the Ronald Reagan administration was really the instigator of many of these policies (while every president who followed essentially bought into the same policies Reagan did).  This is all true and very easy for the average person to look up.  Even the most hardcore conservative would agree with most of these facts.  But Reich leaves out a couple of very important things.  The lesser factor that Reich leaves out of wage value and wage inequality is immigration. Immigration has been exploited to drive down the value of wages in this country.  It is dishonest to not include this in the analysis.

The biggest element Reich leaves out as a factor for wage inequality and wage depreciation is one that most economists and ALL politicians completely leave out of the equation, no matter what political party is assigned to your name.  Whether this is done out of denial or ignorance depends on the economist or politician.  But that issue is the future of energy decline.  We can deny it all we want, but oil probably peaked in this country in 1972 and world supply probably peaked around 2005.  Other energy sources are peaking now or will be soon, some at increasing rates as the scramble to replace cheap oil is enacted.  It doesn't means we will run out of oil or natural gas any time soon.  We won't.  But we will see changes in a very gradual fashion (with the occasional economic shock that puts more Americans permanently out of work and more Americans pushed to the underworked economy).

Many Americans understood this dilemma during the Ford and Carter administration and also understood that conservation techniques would be essential to the future of economics, politics, and lifestyles of the future.  There was a crossroads.  Should Americans gets serious and be leaders in a new conservation economy that embraced ""appropriate technology"", organic farming, and alternative thinking, OR should Americans keep up their lifestyles and embrace nuclear powers, hoping untried reactors and fusion technology were safer than critics assumed?  Unfortunately Reagan and Thatcher swept Americans into a third option: pursuing short term strategies to force down energy prices in order to keep the masses and businesses happy.  SUV culture. Unfortunately every administration since Ronald Reagan, has gone the SUV route, blasting through as much energy as we possibly can in order to prop up upper middle class and rich lifestyles as long as possible.  The early and mid 1970s conservation and appropriate technology movement is now completely forgotten, except for a few stubborn individuals on the fringe.

Well, this SUV lifestyle is coming to an end gradually, and has been for over a decade.  While we use our straw to suck out the trapped energy sources and occasionally talk about unrealistic green energy solutions (do the math -- they are completely unrealistic in a consumer economy and really serve as extensions of fossil fuels -- check out Ozzie Zehner's most comprehensive  and brilliant book Green Illusions), we keep playing this make believe game of capitalist economics.  There is too much to criticize, and detail would take hours, but we need to be more morphological in our historic thinking, as well as realistic. Reich maybe has some solutions that will make our energy decline more equitable for everyone, but as energy decline really starts hitting home, the inequality will continue to get worse and worse.  The same is true of wage value descent, growing unemployment (some permanent), and massive political polarization. I suggest taking a look at the writings of John Michael Greer and his Archdruid Report for a better analysis of the predicaments ahead.  His book, The Long Descent, is a well received book, that despite its faults, has no real fact-based refutations that I have seen.  And I am pretty darn open minded.",1486252800,,4337,5.026573426573426

Robert Reich  talks about economics and how it affects the lives of ordinary people. Come on people ""Econimics"" it is a subject that normally makes people's eyes glaze over in the first few minutes. Yet Robert Reich tells the economics story in very engaging ways using props and turns of phase that bring the human stories affected by economic policy into clear view. Robert Reich highlights how the wealth gap has become a time bomb in our economy and suggests ways to resolve it before it explodes in social unrest or just suffering and pain on heretofore unimaginable levels.

Robert Reich is a little person a fact I did not know before and yes I'm proud of how he handles it. Robert Reich is his own person and he loves life. Watching him go about the task of helping us understand economics was in itself an inspiring experience. Robert Reich took being a little person and made it into a defining strength.

6043056,5,B00G0PXU1A,"Robert Reich is a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. He explains the growing inequality in America. He talks to the rich and the poor and explains what has happened over the last 30 years. Reich is not a dull college professor, hes likable and funny, and the film is both entertaining and thought provoking. The film is also part autobiographical. He was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford with Bill Clinton and at Yale Law School with both Bill and Hillary. The film was released in 2013. Reich endorsed Bernie Sanders in 2016.

Reich shows that for the past 30 years huge amounts of money have been generated in the global economy and most of it has gone up to a tiny fraction of the population. The key to his presentation is a slide which shows that a typical male worker in 1978 was making around $48,000, adjusted for inflation, while the average person in the top 1% earned $390,000. By 2010, the typical male worker was earning $33,000 and the average worker in the top 1% earned $1.1 million.

As well as wages stagnating, many costs are rising faster than inflation, particularly the cost of buying a home, health care, child care, and the rising costs of higher education. At Berkeley, where Reich teaches, in the 1960s, tuition was free. In the 1970s, it was $700 a year in today's dollars. But now it costs $15,000 for in-state residents. Ordinary people are falling behind. Middle-class families, often with two wage earners, are working harder and getting nowhere. In America, a new aristocracy is emerging. Half of the US's total assets are now owned by just 400 people and, Reich believes that this is not just a threat to the economy, but also to democracy.

Reich's thesis is that since the 1970s a combination of anti-union legislation, market deregulation, globalization, and technological innovation have contrived to create a situation in which the economy boomed but less of the wealth trickled down. Though for a while, nobody noticed. There were ""coping mechanisms"". More women entered the workforce, creating dual-income families. Working hours rose. And increasing house prices enabled people to borrow. In 2007, this all came crashing to a halt. He claims that ""we have exhausted all the options."" Reich suggests that if this trend continues there could be trouble in the future.

Reich believes that inequality is linked to education. He argues that more than anything else, that's what lifted people out of poverty and into the middle class in the past. But starting in the late 1970s, college graduation rates began to flatten out. He argues that it is important to invest in people, in the workforce, so Americans can compete in the global economy. Reich uses the example of the iPhone and illustrates where the dollars go when you buy one. Most of the dollars are going to Japan (34%), Germany (17%), South Korea (13%), U.S. (6%), and only 3.6% is going to China. The phone is assembled in China, but the assembly is of pieces from all over the place. Reich wanted his students to see that it's not just cost of wages or labor. It's also which country's workers add what value. Japanese and German workers have the skills needed to participate in the iPhones manufacture. The old assembly line jobs are gone, American workers need the skills so that they too can add value.

Reich argues that taxes are the price we pay to finance the kinds of things that we can't do individually, that we need to do together. One of the problems is that the taxation system has tilted toward the rich and away from the middle class. He interviews Warren Buffett who does not believe he pays enough tax. Buffett claims his tax rate is 17.7%, while the average for the staff in his office is 32.9%. If the wealthy are not paying their fair share and if the middle class are basically stagnant and are not paying much in taxes because they're not making much money, then there is less money to support public higher education and fund infrastructure.

The middle class provides 70% of the spending in the U.S. When the middle class doesn't share in the economic gains, you get into this vicious downward  cycle. The middle class creates jobsbut only if they are given salaries that allow them to be spend, create demand, jobs, and generate more tax revenue. Reich argues that every place you look on Earth where you find prosperity, you find massive investments in the middle class and the poor.

The problem with trickle-down economics is that the rich spend too little. They're not generating enough economic activity. Somebody earning $10 million a year doesn't spend $10 million. A venture capitalist with an eight-figure income is interviewed. He drives an Audi and claims he only needs three pairs of jeans. He saves most of his money. The money of the rich often goes offshore where they can make the highest returns. Reich argues we need to replace trickle-down economics with middle-out economics. The most pro-business thing you can do is to help middle-class people thrive.",1480636800,18,5012,4.806264501160093

6043065,5,B00G0PXU1A,"If the information in this film doesn't provide a clearer and more honest picture of why the middle class in America is struggling, I don't know what will. And, as to the disillusionment of the common citizen in this country with their political leadership, this also addresses many of the reasons behind the recent presidential election phenomenon. Bernie Sanders hit the nail on the head with many perceptions, and nearly half the voting populace turned to Donald Trump to voice their feelings about how the establishment treats and leads the people of this great nation. The leadership of this country should be about the best interests of the majority of its people, not the global financial gain of the privileged few and the institutions which serve primarily those few, including the self interest of the institutions themselves. When is enough ""enough"" for these people, and how long is the public going to take the callous treatment handed them by their political leadership?

There is simply no way most folks in an advanced society can benefit from free trade without tariff protections. The benefits of an advanced society cost money, and the long road to achieving those benefits must be protected, not set aside for the sake of greater profits and the ability to compete in third world emerging markets. Build your factories there, and sell within that society at lower costs in that market, but don't allow selling those products in advanced nations who simply cannot fairly compete against low wages, little environmental protection costs and minimal society and infrastructure costs. All of this benefits mostly multinational corporate bottom lines and global financial industry profits, not the best interests of most individuals in advanced societies, who have struggled over generations to better their living standards. And, why should advanced societies be expected to sacrifice those gains, by paying lower costs for the products from outside their societies at the sacrifice of their own jobs and economic well-being? That cycle cannot last long before advanced societies are forced to lower their standards of living as the less advanced nations catch up.",1479340800,,2180,5.228571428571429

6043117,5,B00G0PXU1A,"Mr. Reich is a modern day hero in my opinion.  He lays out the recent history of income and economic inequality in the US, in clear, unambiguous language that all or most can easily understand.  The solutions are the challenge for the American people, but importantly, there IS hope, as long as folks can become increasingly informed and educated in this area and become motivated and activated in ways that will effectively create change over the coming years, decades and beyond.  Our situation, as Mr. Reich explains, didn't happen overnight...it's taken 40 or more years for the inequality problem to become what it is today, and it will take determination and hard work and folks becoming informed and involved to reverse it and hopefully insure it never happens again.",1474156800,,774,4.984496124031008

Mr, Reich does (sort of) admit the short comings of the administration he last worked for, and that they could have done more. For the most part it stays on target about the inequality issue, and not too far into leftist politics.  I would like to see an economist's rebuttal of his arguments.",1473984000,,444,4.67948717948718

I new something was not right with the U.S.'s class system but now I am ashamed to say that it all boils down to greed and the human condition of never being satisfied or content.  Checks n balances.  Sure having it all is great, but literally having it all will eventually lead to no one having anything.  If this one thing could be fixed, it would trickle down to the rest of the social problems we are having just like their economic policies.  Only this trickle would be welcome.  We need to be a class 4 civilization by the time the next astroid gets here and we are only at a 1.5 still.  Sad something as simple and trivial as greed will ultimately be what brings us to our demise.  This is what happens if we don't pay attention.",1473984000,,760,4.340425531914893

Great wealth has ALWAYS corrupted those in power, and in turn corrupts the Governments ruling the common peoples.
It has always been this way, and will continue to be so until Christ returns. Then, for the very first time ever, there will be equality FOR ALL.
Until then, for those who refuse to honor God, and hold Christ as their only way of salvation, hold on best you can.
For those of us who do, we see what's going on, and pray, Come Lord Jesus.
Because the most important thing Reich failed to mention, is that when the people of nation openly turns it's back on God, and becomes openly hostile to any who do not, and willingly gives place to things that God has forbidden, that nation will not stand for long. This ""nation"" will tear itself apart, because EVERYONE wants to do what is right in their own eyes, and all have adopted a subjective morality.",1473465600,,948,4.361581920903955

It explains a lot about the ""system"" that I had not put together myself, though I had done my research into many of the things he discusses.  But this movie puts it all together and gives it a human face -- in other words, you and me, real people living real lives and how the system affects us all, from top to bottom, and how it all got that way.  If you ever wondered why it all feels like it's stacked against you, even though you work as hard as you can, this is the movie for you.

Meanwhile ""singles"" are brutally ""taxed"" (our incomes stolen) to support feloniously enslaved ""marrieds"" and antisocial population litterers to satisfy the dictates of felony tax evading ""religion"" gangs.

Interestingly, when you watch the documentary you will realize that this income inequality is also to blame for the rise of Donald Trump (though Robert Reich doesn't mention it). The working people in the US have been led to the tipping point of frustration, and people are constantly looking for someone to blame, and so that hits home to Trumps main message. Bernie Sanders would have brought us much closer to ending this massive income inequality, but now that the DNC cheated him out of the elections, the future of the US is unfortunately very uncertain.

Friends and Family, here is an email I sent to one of my hero's, Dr. Robert Reich, UC Berkeley professor, and past Labor Secretary under Clinton. I will let you know if I hear from him. I spoke with him before the 2008 collapse, as I note below. Now that I am out of the broker/dealer world, where all of my writings were squashed, I will try to do what I can to help motivate an economic and environmental Renaissance, saving the species from what I fear, the extinction of homogreedious. I must admit, I think that the US resonse to the extinction level risk of climate change is ""far too little and far too late,"" but better to go out at least trying! With love, Jim

Dr. Reich,

By way of introduction, we spoke in 2007 about my work, then called ""The Slowing Growth Future,"" and my forecast that the economy was on the brink of collapse. You noted that you hoped I was wrong. Sad news, I was not.

Now my work I title ""The Beginning of The End Times,"" due to the the following primary market driving forces, resulting in three massive collapse periods:

1. 2016-2025 - A Global Deflationary Soft Recession, due to global aging; the US fiscal gap resulting in rising current and structural deficits - necessitating government spending cuts and tax increases; and, the average savings of 55-64 yr olds being only $12,000.

2. 2025-2035 - A Global Deflationary Soft Depression, due to massively rising deficits - the fiscal gaps becoming current and structural deficits - necessitating massive cuts in government spending and increases in taxes; a massive collapse in the global stock markets to where the dividend yield provides a reasonable risk adjusted total return of 5-6%, where it was when I made this forecast; the average retirement savings dropping to around $5,000, due to this market collapse; a collapse in housing and commercial real estate, due to the above; and, the implosion of financial companies, due to the above, making many of these bankrupt.

3. 2035-2050 - A Global Inflationary Great Depression - Due to the world falling off Hubbert's Cliff, and the extension of the above.

4. 2050 on - Hell on Earth, due to the above, and runaway climate change.

On my Facebook page, I provide a documentary based summary of these arguments. Here is the link.

[...]

I conclude that there is only one solution to save the species:

The only solution to save our species, I argue, is for the UN to issue 5% of global GDP (gross domestic product) of countries in a ""save the species"" non-debt based currency, similar to the way Lincoln used ""green backs"" to finance the Civil War, and invest these funds in transitioning the world to a renewable energy planet.

This would be extremely difficult, even if the world would almost drop everything and transition now. Think of it, this means transitioning roughly 1.2 billion and growing gasoline cars and hundreds of millions of gasoline trucks and other vehicles to electric, roughly 1.5 million gas stations to recharging stations, transitioning manufacturing back to local areas and based on renewable energies, transitioning global food production to local organic renewable energy based farming, building out a global electric smart grid, building out global high speed electric rail, building out millions of windmills and farms, millions of solar farms and plants, hundred of millions of solar panels on homes, completely restructuring living in cities and communities to sustainable renewable energy cities and communities.

These tasks are daunting if you have a century or more to do it! Let alone decades! Think of how disruptive this would be to the distribution of wealth and power in the world - like nothing the world has ever experienced before!

It is too late, in my opinion, for a ""carbon tax"" to do anything meaningful, and ""cap and trade"" is just another billionaire play!

Although the distribution of wealth is a critical issue, the transition to renewable energies, in my view, is the most critical issue facing homogreedious. If we don't solve this problem, in my opinion, it will be the end off the species.

Please review my overview of ""The Beginning of The End Times.""

Here is my work history.

[...]

I, like my hero, you, am still trying to ""save the planet.""

I believe that if we can get Hillary to see the rising risks facing the planet due to climate change, peak energy, and the risk of scaling up hard fossil production when the world falls off Hubbert's Clifff, and that this series of events may result in the extinction of the species, we may have some real hope.

Pleas, please give my overview a read.

I believe we are facing the crossroads of human civilization, we either:

1. continue on the current path, enter a global great deflationary soft depression, then an inflationary great depression, and then end all species, due to runaway climate change, or

2. transition the US and assist the world in transitioning to a renewable energy sustainable world, saving the species, and creating a massive economic and environmental Renaissance.

If you can see the vision and can help me, please let me know.

Thanks so much for all you have done! You are my hero.

Have a great week,
Jim",1470009600,,5397,4.792880258899676

6043299,5,B00G0PXU1A,"No matter what your politics, this is one documentary that you owe it to yourself  to see. It is well-researched, thoughtful, and very scary. Robert Reich has a marvelous sense of humor, which keeps the movie more lighthearted than the facts might warrant. Completely non-partisan, this movie offers a clear-eyed view of a system that truly is stacked in the favor of those who already have most of the money and therefore make the rules. Consider, for instance, that the man who earned $41,000 in 1974 earns approximately $27,000 today for doing the same job, in money adjusted for inflation. Yet his boss, who theoretically does a job comparable with bosses of 1974, now makes more than 1000% more than he would have made then. This is obscene! Reich makes a strong case that without wages rising for the middle class, not only is our economy not going to get better but the very fabric of Democracy is in peril. The parallels between today's situation and that of 1929, just prior to the Great Depression, are sobering. People must have hope for themselves and their children. Only if Americans arm themselves with facts and say, ""NO MORE!"" is there any hope of being able to climb the economic ladder in any meaningful way.",1464825600,,1227,4.76056338028169

This documentary is eye-opening, and hopefully after watching it, people will be less likely to allow themselves to be taken advantage of or tossed by the wayside by their employer. I wish they had focused a little more on unions, since unions can make a huge difference in wage, benefits, quality of life, protection against wrongful termination, protection against wage/benefit erosion, etc., etc. I highly recommend this documentary to people who realize their need to arm themselves with knowledge to prepare and achieve a better future for their family.",1464652800,,827,5.0

His thesis is pragmatically supported by clear facts and figures.  I believe his ideas and points are extremely relevant, and should be seriously considered included in and at all levels of local, State, and Federal government policy/decision making.  Timely.

Also it talked a lot about how important having a healthy and thriving middle class is for driving our economy.  Makes the solid point that tax breaks for the rich do not help business or the economy. Very interesting ,eye opening documentary, a must watch if you care about our economy and the American way of life, and how the super rich are slowly eliminating the middle class and unions.",1464048000,,672,4.647058823529412

6043340,5,B00G0PXU1A,"I watched the whole film and I read many of the worst reviews, many very detailed.

First, this is not socialist or anything similar.  It is clearly a presentation of facts and opinions from a person that love the democratic and capitalist systems and is concerned for their future in our country.  These ideas deserve to be heard and debated and if you can't do that without name calling and labeling then I, for one will not be interested in your input.  That goes regardless of the side you argue.

Second, I must have missed the part where he said raising wages is a solution.  I heard him talk about investing in people but that seemed largely focused on doing things to educate people and improving their skills and value.  That in turn will raise wages.

I also heard people talking about the concept of job creators and how our assumption that the wealthy are job creators.  I personally will not argue that point although I do fall on one side of that assumption.  If you want to know the truth there may be two ways.  Look and increases and decreases in wealthy income verses job growth or raise taxes on income that comes from investments that do not create jobs and see who screams.

To me, we need to educate better.",1463875200,,1229,4.486486486486487

It's a lot of pro union talk.  I manage a union workforce. Most of the time is good because i don't have to worry about raises, entitlements, etc. My problem with unions is they protect lazy people.

It pieces together a history of the political and economic changes since the 1970's which led to the growing disparity between working-class Americans and the wealthy-class. It backs up its assertions with research and gives many tangible examples. I gave it only four stars because for those looking just for a film on the topic of inequality may not fully enjoy the film as it is also somewhat of a biographical sketch of the professional life of Robert Reich.",1463356800,,643,4.8545454545454545

This year's election primaries are interesting in that many of the blue collar finally realize that the ""establishment politicians"" are there to serve only the interests of the rich.  However, on the Republican side it is a shame that their only other alternative is you know who.",1463011200,,645,4.723214285714286

6043406,5,B00G0PXU1A,"This may be the most important non-fiction movie of the last 50 years (and 50 years ago I was 21). When politicians spout platitudes and rah-rah, much of it downright lies, we desperately need an explanation for where we are and how we got here in order to sort out where we want to be and what it takes to get there. Robert Reich lays out the whats and the hows and quite a few of the whys in a way that is both factual and entertaining. He doesn't talk down or insult the viewer's intelligence. He lays out the picture of how capitalism and government depend on each other, and how the middle class depends on both. Where did we go wrong? Watch the film. It's a must see.

He is a world-reknown economist and writer, and this documentary is based on one of his books. In this, he discusses how the economy works, what makes it go...and what makes it stall...and why. He also gives a bit of a history lesson, running down the past century or so of economic policies in the U.S., and why they worked or didn't, and what they can tell us about how to do things now. This is an excellent film, and worth watching for anyone the least bit interested in the economy, how our country got to the point where it is today, and why what we're doing isn't working.

6043492,3,B00G0PXU1A,"Reich's heart is in the right place.  But some of his analysis is strained and conclusionary.  Correlations between rising and falling economic indicators do not mean that their is a causal connection, which he assumes consistently.  I also take umbrage with how he defines middle class, wealthy and other terms.  The other problem is that he completely ignores fairly obvious reasons for the behavior of various groups of people (e.g., greed, lack of interest, lack of capacity or ability).  It seems clear that wage inequality upsets some people greatly.  There also should be no doubt that the huge disparity between the incomes of the uber rich and the struggling hoards is facially unfair.  But there are certainly people who would passionately disagree with even these fairly innocuous observations.  It is very clear where Reich falls in this controversial topic.  Having studied both philosophy and economics at the school where Reich teaches in the film, I certainly found it interesting that those were the subjects he studied while at Oxford.  I wish I would have liked the film more.  But, as I started, his heart is in the right place so I wanted to like it before it started.",1462233600,2,1189,4.954545454545454

Many people talk about inequality but few support their arguments with facts that are made both compelling and yet so entertaining and easy to digest. Reich's interviews with people from all segments of the income distribution are particularly enlightening. Reich embraces policies that work and debunks policies that don't work with clear and irrefutable logic, sparing no one including himself. Every bit of this film is researched and considered.

6043584,5,B00G0PXU1A,"Robert Reich is all too lovable, certainly when he leaves his students with some of the most inspiring and passion-inciting words they can ever hope to hear; or when he sensitively recalls some childhood anecdotes; or expresses the fervor and frustration that caused him to voluntarily forego a dreamy secretarial position alongside President Clinton.
In ""Inequality For All,"" we get to go inside the mind, and literally experience a day in the life of, such a genuine, charismatic soul. But it's the objective information about today's United States of America--the exposure of failed economic opportunities, the hard work that rewards individuals with foreclosed homes, the ever more devastating income inequality gap, the volatile history of income tax percentages among the wealthy, not to mention interviews with sympathetic wealthy persons--that make this documentary so incredibly appropriate for today's audiences.
The film recaptures a time--specifically the few decades immediately following World War II--when the USA had a bar-none education system and labor force. Individuals flocked to this country in hopes of experiencing such a fulfilling lifestyle. I specifically aforesaid ""today's audiences"" because I don't know if the USA will ever boast this esteem on the global scale again. But with Reich's motivation, and the film's invitation to viewers to change the world around them, there surely always is hope. And if--nay, when--we have recreated the United States of yesteryear, this documentary will become obsolete as an information source, though invaluable as a symbol chronicling our generation.",1461369600,,1619,5.639344262295082

6043599,4,B00G0PXU1A,Good documentary showing correlations between shifts from higher tax rates prior to 1980 to the current lowest tax rates in history that have benefitted the top 1% while dramatically widening the income inequality and eroding the middle class.  That and a number of other factors have shifted power away from the 99%. The documentary questions whether or not the government is still working for the benefit of the people or just for the benefits of the corporate lobbyists representing big business and the top 1%.,1461196800,,514,5.047058823529412
6043600,5,B00G0PXU1A,When Clinton was in office I knew Robert Reich as a talking head of the president. But his documentary makes some valid and concerning insights about our economy. Why we are not prospering more when our GNP is accelerating. I found his arguments surprising because I really felt they were going to be very left leaning and that was not the case at all. He showed history of how the economy failed in the past for the same reasons and why they are bound to hit rock bottom again. Stimulating and insightful throughout the documentary it is definitely worth the watch.,1461110400,,566,4.6138613861386135

Reich is a liberal's liberal--clear-eyed and optimistic with down to bone skepticism of self-serving politics, and it turns out in heaps in this film.  Reich has always been an advocate for bottom-up economics, and was one of the most vocal critics of Reagan's ""trickle  down"" theory.  A strong middle class is what carries a strong economy...and anyone at any strata of economic experience agrees with this, even though they may not be outwardly saying it.  Reich stops short of being a Robin Hood, but after years of economic abuse, the U.S. I think could use a full-blown Robin Hood--and Reich is the next best thing to it.

The huge influx of corporate money into politics was also discussed (i.e. Citizen's United).

then no one will to protect us. Social media outlets are what most have left as a voice.
The video stresses that we must mobilize, organize and energize  others to
get money out of politics; elevate & rebuild the Middle Class.
History is on the side of positive social change:
think Womens right to vote, Civil Rights;
Unions giving people a voice to obtain a living wage;

Republicans and Democrats want the same thing..to reward hard work. But, the devil is in the details. Republicans think we have too many welfare programs disincentivizing hard work and rewarding the lazy. In principal I think we'd all agree that we don't want to reward laziness, but is that what's happening? In the context of the current environment of economic inequality could it be that having too much of the wealth at the top is disincentivising hard work, limiting opportunity and undermining our economy? Do we have lazy people on welfare or are the american people working hard and just not making any money? Could we have hard working poor and lazy overpaid wealthy?  Are businesses or consumers the ""job creators?"" What were America's tax rates in the past an how did the economy do? What's the data show about ""trickle down economics?""  Why do workers at Walmart still consume 6 billion in taxpayer funded welfare? If you've ever pondered these thoughts you have to watch this movie.

The rich can still be rich beyond measure while the middle class doesn't have to become poorer with stagnant and declining wages. The consumer drives the economy. If we don't have money to spend, businesses lose and start laying off the very people it depends upon to purchase its products.
You can only buy so many houses, cars, boats ... At the end of the day a wealthy family still only spends so much of their income while the rest of their is tied up in the stock market, where it does nothing for the economy. Money needs to stay in circulation.

It is about striking a healthy balance. Right now, we're way too top heavy. The middle class is the backbone of this nation and we can't sustain and grow if things don't change.",1444608000,,1053,4.560846560846561
6043802,5,B00G0PXU1A,"This documentary presents eye-opening statistics about our current Capitalistic system. It illustrates perfectly how great Capitalism can be but how there are numerous flaws within the American system which prevents it from being as ideal as possible. The film does a great job of providing anecdotal stories about real-life people who are struggling to navigate this post-2008 economy, and offers some relatively actionable and practical solutions. My only qualm with this film is that it fails to go the full distance of offering a solution which is easily executable and something which every common lay person and average citizen can implement immediately. Nonetheless, terrific film by what seems to be a terrifically brilliant individual who has real-world experience at a topic which is very near-and-dear to the hearts of most Americans!",1444608000,,845,5.458015267175573

If you have not viewed this video, I suggest purchasing the DVD as you will gain more information on the problem by viewing it multiple times --over time.

6043908,4,B00G0PXU1A,"Inequality for All is a documentary by 72 Productions and director Jacob Kornbluth. The film premiered January 19, 2013 at the Sundance Film Festival. Radius-TWC, a distribution label from The Weinstein Company, released a limited run in theaters on September 27, 2013. The United States was slowly crawling out of the subprime mortgage and financial crisis of 2007-2009; budget issues plagued the country, and unemployment was steadily but slowly declining. An exhausting fiscal cliff debate had finally ended; tax breaks for most wealthy people became permanent, while workers saw their payroll tax deductions permanently eliminated at the same time. A climate that saw the wealthy get wealthier, the working man lose ground, and an economy that was failing to recover seemed the appropriate setting for Robert Reich to discuss income inequality and its effect on economic growth.
 Reich, the film's presenter, is the embodiment of Ivy League pedigree. Reich attended Dartmouth College, won a Rhodes Scholarship to study at the University of Oxford, and received a J.D. from Yale Law School. He has served in three federal administrations, the last of which he served as Secretary of Labor for President Bill Clinton. Reich is an author, editor, and commentator; he is currently the Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the University of California Berkeley.
 Why would such an erudite be concerned with the class of people to which he has no connection? Reich states in his film that he used to be picked on and bullied throughout his childhood, so he had to make alliances with older and bigger guys for protection. One of these guys, Michael Schwerner, was tortured and murdered by racists in Mississippi while registering African-American voters. Reich states:
""I had sensed that something fundamental had to change. Not only in American society, but also in me. And all of you, right now, understand intuitively that if we allowed America to continue in the direction it was going on, with the wealth and the income and the power and the political potential for corruption and all that represents, that the bullies would be in charge.""
 Inequality for All is a filmed aimed squarely at those in the once thriving and currently withering middle class, as well as the wealthy with a conscience. The topic should hold the attention of the 99% who see crumbling standards of living, polarization, and declining worker representation. The primary point driven by Reich is the middle class is the backbone of a healthy vibrant economy, and centralization of wealth in the hands of a few has only contributed to the decline of the middle class. The issues spotlighted through the course of the documentary are the minimum wage, strengthening the voice of workers, investing in education, reforming Wall Street, fixing the tax structure, and getting big money out of politics. Throughout the course of the film, Reich uses a combination of correlational data and real world examples of those who are struggling.  The visual data used appeals to pragmatists, and those with a more ideological focus will appreciate the testimonies from those who struggle day to day to get ahead in the world.
 Reich does not have any issues establishing credibility. He is well versed on the subject of inequality and economics, especially provided his work and educational background. It would be difficult to challenge his authority on the subject matter, particularly when he seems to have thoroughly researched the topic.
 Reich's logic is literally visible throughout the film. He does a good job of using visuals to display concepts such as rising costs, stagnating wages, poverty mobility rates, consumerism, and tuition rates. These all seem to work on the surface, but the viewer does not have much time to digest the data and look for more meaning. Fortunately, one can visit inequalityforall.com and download the graphics package used in the film. Reich also uses where we have been as a country to bolster his claims that the United States can flourish, but it falls short in a practical sense; the past is not always a good indicator of the future, and those who know how to work the system to their advantage can always use these same lessons from the past to increase the income gap.
 Inequality for All is a documentary with as much passion as it has ideology. One can sense Reich's passion when he speaks in front of an audience, and that passion is just as equal when he is speaking only to the camera. The scenes of protests and interviews of the two families struggling to make ends meet really serve to make an emotional appeal, but the comment from Deborah Frias, a litigation assistant, really puts the argument to a point - ""How do you build wealth? Not that I want to be wealthy. I just. . . How do you do it? How the heck do you build wealth, like, when you don't have anything, when you don't have any assets, when you don't have nothing?"" That gut check ties directly into the poverty mobility rate argument, and it should make one really consider the forces that may be at work against the middle class.
 Overall, the documentary film certainly does improve the argument against income inequality. Interviews of people simply trying to get by - even an interview with someone not struggling at all - coupled with strong visuals, makes an overall appeal that is difficult to ignore.  The tone can seem somber at times, but remains positive and upbeat overall.
 I think Reich's film does succeed in fulfilling his intentions, but only on a surface level, and I will get to that in a moment. The circumstances, timing, and audience seems to be nearly perfect for the delivery of his message, and Reich's sense of empathy is outstanding. It almost makes me forget that Reich himself is worth more than four million dollars, according to the website therichest.com.
 Some may point to Reich's net worth and question his ability to shine a spotlight on the income gap. I would be prone to being sucked into that argument, if I really wanted to pick apart somebody based strictly on party lines or, say, make a complete straw man argument. To me Reich's income really has nothing to do with how credible he is in his argument. I find it endearing that a millionaire cares about more than himself. Reich made this movie with the hopes of reaching out and alerting people to what is going on around them, and I will not begrudge him if he makes millions more from this film. The greatest influence for me in this film was Reich's ability to be humble and human, regardless of his salary or bank account. That is not a typical characteristic impressed upon the working class by those of more than ample means.
 Back to my comment about the film fulfilling intentions only on a surface level. It is easy to get fired up when watching this film. I personally make what I consider to be an decent wage, and I always wonder where in hell it all went at the end of the month. I am saving, but it feels as if I could be doing so much better. While Inequality for All does a great job of getting the message out, it does little in the way of telling people how to make changes. Fortunately, the website for the movie does provide action items for making changes. Maybe that is all the film is supposed to be; a wakeup call to those who are idly getting by, meagerly living from one check to another. The rest is up to us. Income inequality may exist, but we do have voices and tools to help us lessen that inequality. I thank Robert Reich for pointing us in the right direction.",1425254400,2,7578,4.794027565084226

6043921,5,B00G0PXU1A,"When you stretch a rubber band to its' extreme point it breaks apart well that's a good analogy of the ever widening and expanding wealth gap between the rich 1% and poor people in America, there is no middle class you have the rich 1% and either working poor or non-working poor. This film talks about this issue ROBERT REICH'S viewpoint is very much welcomed since he was SECRETARY OF LABOR under former President Clinton, here are some of the significant points ROBERT REICH talks about:
1. THREE DECADES AFTER WORLD WAR 2 1947-1977 THE U.S. ECONOMY BOOMED
2. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE G.I. BILL HELPED VETERANS MOVE INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS
3. EXPANSION OF FREE OR LOW COST PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES
4. 35% OF WORKERS BELONGED TO LABOR UNIONS BY THE MID 1950s
5. FROM 1947-1977 THE U.S. HAD THE LARGEST MIDDLE CLASS THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN
ROBERT REICH also talks about THE VIRTUOUS CYCLE: PRODUCTIVITY GROWS-WAGES INCREASE-WORKERS BUY MORE-COMPANIES HIRE MORE-TAX REVENUES INCREASE-GOVERNMENT INVESTS MORE-WORKERS ARE BETTER EDUCATED. From 1980-today globalization, government deregulation of corporations, tax breaks for the rich 1%, out sourcing manufacturing jobs overseas, and a stark reduction of labor union jobs contribute to make up this VICIOUS CYCLE: WAGES STAGNATE-WORKERS BUY LESS-COMPANIES DOWNSIZE-TAX REVENUES DECREASE-GOVERNMENT CUTS PROGRAMS-WORKERS ARE LESS EDUCATED-UNEMPLOYMENT RISES. ROBERT REICH makes an excellent point when he says ""BIG COMPANIES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE PROFITS, NOT GENERATE JOBS,"" he also points out ""THAT WITH MONEY COMES THE CAPACITY TO CONTROL POLITICS"" in 2010 3.5 billion dollars was spent to influence political decisions in Washington D.C.

According to this film, it would appear that all we have to do is take more from those filthy rich bastards in the 1% in the way of taxes ('their fair share') and ""invest"" more in the 'middle class', then everything will get better in America. Then we can have the same prosperous middle class as the really progressive countries in Europe.
They even found some fool who said that his business and his wealth doesn't create jobs. Then proceeded to speak about how he was proud to be one of the early investors in Amazon. Let's think about this - because he didn't - he invested in Amazon, which helped the company get started and grow, which hired more people (created jobs!), which made money, and grew, and hired more people. So the investor became wealthier and more jobs were created. Now he has more money to invest in more businesses and create more jobs.
I would not have ever watched this film if my daughter had not been forced to sit through this in an English Composition class in college.

6043984,3,B00G0PXU1A,"My reaction to ""Inequality for All"", Clintonite Robert Reich's brilliant primer on the failed economic system called capitalist, is similar to my reaction to Reich's co-star Nick Hanauer who wrote ""The Pitchforks are coming ... for us Plutocrats"" (Politico, June 2014). The movie clearly documents the cyclical failures of capitalism, despite the spin put on it for Democrats to whom it is pitched. Nick Hanauer is a central figure in that movie.

In the movie as in the article, Hanauer begins by saying that he is an unapologetic capitalist. The Politico piece is essentially a warning to the class with which Hanauer clearly and unapologetically self-identifies - the capitalist class which he hopes and intends to see survive. Hanauer's warning? ""You are about to kill the goose that laid the golden capitalist egg. Don't.""

The other part of this article  and movie which disturbs me is Hanauer's incomplete and careful presentation of his personal history. Both in the article and in the movie, Hanauer essentially presents himself as a humble millionaire pillow-maker who has come to the, for him apparently, mind-opening realization that he can only buy so many pillows himself, only so many blue jeans, and only so many Volvos and other consumer products from his fellow capitalists.

Hanauer does mention his relationship with Amazon. But in neither the movie nor the article does he mention that among his venture capitalist endeavors was being on the board of and an early investor in Hood River-based Insitu, Inc., the manufacturer of the most deadly drones in the world for the US Air Force and Marine Corps, now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Boeing.

What is even more disturbing about that fact is that in the movie Hanauer makes the absurd and incredible statement that he doesn't really know where his money comes from. Again that is in the context of presenting himself as a humble pillow-making millionaire (as he say in the movie ""not the smartest, not the hardest working"", just the most opportunist), rather than a drone manufacturing billionaire.

If he doesn't watch it, Hanauer's honesty will result in him taking a pitch fork, not from the 99.99%, but rather from his 0.01% colleagues, who at least as of today seem to be far from being convinced by his true confessions, as far as they go.

Perhaps Hanauer's intentions here are noble but I still find it rather peculiar and find myself scratching my head in large part because of his glossing over his understanding of how capitalist exploitation works and his unmentioned involvement with Insitu. To me, having watched the movie twice with Democrat audiences bubbling over with approval and gushing with hope, it is abundantly clear that this ""Inequality for All"" construct is part of the liberal-progressive Trojan horse the Democrats are climbing into already in advance of the 2016 US presidential election, the early stages of the campaign for which are already under way.

However, this is a very well done documentary. There are moments of slight bias when the topics touch the world of politics, but the economic arguments are sound and well reasoned. As even a layperson can tell you, our economy is not healthy. A vibrant middle class is always at the heart of a healthy economic engine and as this film points out, the middle class is not doing so well.

This film examines the reason for the decline of the middle class and manages to do so without engaging is so called ""class warfare."" Rather than attack the wealthy like some documentarians, Robert Reich takes the intellectual high road and keeps his analysis confined to facts and basic economic principles.

6044005,5,B00G0PXU1A,"The point of taxing the rich isn't to pay for more government services, it's to spread wealth fairly, expand the middle class, and reduce the number of poor people.

Median wages have gone down in real terms. For about 30 years, from 1950 to 1980, it was possible for a middle class family to buy a nice house, go on vacation, and put children through college on ONE median income. Today, two median incomes are necessary and even then, that family won't be as comfortable as it was in the 1960s.

The rich getting richer doesn't help the economy because they can only consume so much. It's the middle class that does all the spending that translates into a healthy economy. Make the middle class prosperous, expand it and you improve the economy and society.

Give tax breaks to the rich (and by rich, I mean the top 0.1%) and you help them get richer at the expense of the middle class, and without creating more demand for goods and services. Demand comes from the middle class and Ronald Reagan got it wrong: it does not trickle down from the rich.

6044009,4,B00G0PXU1A,"Synopsis:  Robert Reich gives an impassioned demonstration as to why income inequality is the most destructive force for the American economy.  Reich interviews politicians, entrepreneurs, students, and others to demonstrate how anyone of either side of the aisle should be recognizing income inequality for what it is instead of dismissing it as ""socialism"" or ""Marxism.""  He gives footage of recent events that show both the right and the left are dissatisfied with the bailing out of Wall Street while Main Street suffers.  News footage is shown (both from stock and from Reich's own political career) demonstrating the decline of America's golden age (where Republicans were further left of center than many of today's Democrats) to one where private interests, corporate media, and lobbying have hijacked the political process to make sure that the needs of the ""haves"" trump the needs of the ""have nots.""

Reich did well to present an argument that when the wealthy get too wealthy, everyone else suffers because of how the ""little people"" are expected to deal with the gap in income (read:  credit spending Vs. independent spending power.)  Reich does what he can to provide facts to support his causes instead of relying on fear-mongering or solely opinion to get his point across.  I respect the fact that he expressed his dissatisfaction with serving in the Clinton Administration and called out how presidents like Eisenhower, Nixon, and Ford (all Republicans) seemed to serve their citizens better than Clinton or Obama have (but don't expect any similar love for Reagan.)

I had a few qualms.  One was that you were made to feel more sympathetic for the OWS crowd as opposed to the Tea Party (who, despite having ideals, are ultimately fighting against the same thing.)  That and there wasn't much mention of what happened during the 70s when the wealthy weren't wealthy enough (in which the resulting stagflation was too much of a hindrance to job development and innovation during that time.)  Yes consumers drive the economy, but there's a point where investors need to have the tools to get businesses started.  Just because we're too far in one direction today doesn't mean that we couldn't end up too far in another direction tomorrow.

All and all, it will make you think (and isn't a ""Let's bash Republicans!"" fest that some may think it could be.)  I recommend viewing it and purchasing it if it's up your alley.",1407801600,,2434,5.004962779156328

6044043,1,B00G0PXU1A,"At the center of Reich's argument is the assumption that ""wealth inequality"" is a bad thing. He tries to trick viewers into thinking that ""wealth inequality"" is the same as ""economic discrimination"", it is not. This is a major leap in logic that those opposed to of ""diversity in income levels"" will always make. Despite widely proclaiming ""diversity"" as a positive thing when it relates to nationality, race, religion and sexual orientation when it relates to income levels it is judged as bad. This movie fails because it never attempts to honestly explain it's own agenda, there is no reason given for the bedrock assumption that wealth inequality is at all problem. One person doesn't become ""poor"" because another person becomes wealthy. The statistics used regarding how well the poor get along are those which relate to ""quality of life"" not ""how much richer is some other guy"".

Liberal Statist's try very hard to put forth the idea that they speak for the common man, as if they had no vested personal interest in their political ambitions. Sometimes the best way to appeal to the common man is to make a blatant ""appeal to the masses"" by promoting an ""us vs. them"" mob mentality. Reich's message is more as a call for the masses to rise against the few. The few whom he describes as ""having more than they need"" and ""poor contributors to the GDP on average"" (a claim never validated with numeric data, instead by the story of a seemingly random investor who doesn't know where his money is invested, from there narrator assumes it must be in the terrible ""non-socially beneficial investments"". Logic doesn't get any more hackneyed than that.)

It is clear to me that this movie is a product of a growing endemic facing the western world, the professional statist. These people could care less about equality, they just want to be the one's at the top. They want to be the ""philosopher kings"" they studied in humanities class. They want control over EVERYTHING and the wealth redistribution scheme they endorse will give them vast unchecked power. Any student of politics knows that centralized authority will ultimately be used by it's incumbents to benefit themselves, both individually and as a privileged class.

This movie very much follows director Michael Moore's style of ""documentary""; lots of appeal to the emotions and questionable logic supported by irrelevant mathematical data thrown in so the theory looks convincing to the young and impressionable. If this where nothing more than one guy trying to cash-in on a popular film genre I would not be as disturbed as I am. The reality though is this movie represents another ""cog in the machine"" made by a bunch a self-promoting politicians who want nothing more than what benefits them personally. When these people finally get their way, those who believed they would benefit from the politics of statist expansion will be the ones most afflicted the by it's effects. Instead of equality they will get a pyramid scheme where nepotism and bribery is the determining factor determining where an individual lies in the ""trickle down"" system state control.",1404432000,16,3124,4.946666666666666

6044049,5,B00G0PXU1A,"Former secretary of labor, Robert Reich, may have faced headwinds in the Clinton Administration for not viewing the larger picture. Although the U.S. has the largest economy as measured by GDP (until China surpasses us by 2020), we rank 12th highest per capita income at $48,000 in 2011 dollars. Currently more than 2 billion of the worlds population subsist in impoverish conditions on less than $2.00 a day. Given our high standard of living, should consumerism continue unabated as if we have infinite resource? The planet is heating up from CO2 emissions (currently at 400 ppm but rising every year and is increasing at an accelerated rate) by burning coal, oil, and gas and it is altering the climate. Our fresh water supplies are dwindling as the Colorado River no longer flows into the Pacific Ocean. A dearth of its supply would be a far greater concern. The use of the of the term ""income inequality"" conjures a sense of entitlement to the less privileged. Should we practice providence and be concerned for future generations and what kind of imbroglio we leave for them? We should and we are and that is the intent of the reduced wages for the middle class since the late 1970's. Why not make the Federal Minimum Wage the cynosure and raise it, say, to $15 an hour, to succor and distribute ophelimity for the lowest income earners? Furthermore, globalization is a worthy pursuit because it raises incomes (for basic necessities and to relieve suffering and dying from poverty) in third world nations. The goal should be to benefit humanity in most need not a faction of U.S. And this is the prevailing view among economists as we're moving in that direction, beginning with the enactment of NAFTA.",1402444800,,1709,4.836177474402731

There's a stagnation in wages in the US, a tendency for education to become further out of reach of ordinary people, and a growing divide between the incomes at the top and the bottom.

Reich makes a case for why this is so which you may or may not agree with but nonetheless it's a depressing reality that is facing a lost generation where the opportunities of social mobility are never realized and the ability to attain the fairly modest goals of middle class life is slipping away. Reich is a great orator and carries this documentary with ease and flair - he's clearly passionate about the subject and offers some solutions for restoring the opportunity to a country which has essentially lost some of the key ingredients that historically made it so economically beneficial for the majority of its people.",1399420800,,1139,4.871134020618556

Otherwise, I agree that the portion of the wealth generated by our collective efforts is too concentrate with a few persons.

Let's remember, America created Globalization and although it has caused some in the American Middle Class to experience wage stagnation, millions of others around the world enjoy more of the fruits of their labors.

As far as the movie itself goes; Reich is likable, the film is well done and entertaining.  It definitely skews to the left as we now define the left, but not enough to inflame the conservative viewer.  If anything, the film gives the Tea Party a nice look into the enemy's camp.

6044105,1,B00G0PXU1A,"The movie is thought provoking, though it's clearly one-dimensional and somewhat near-sighted.

The premise of the movie is that 70% of the economy is consumption, and if middle class earners don't have high wages, they can't consume, which creates a vicious cycle where consumption decreases, government spending decreases, the workforce becomes less educated...rinse and repeat and we end up in a broken system. The proposed solution? Raise middle class wages and all of our problems will be solved. Oh, how I wish world peace could be achieved by such simple advice!

Here are three inconvenient truths that Reich ignores:

1.) Reich completely dodges the bullet of global inequality. Wages in the US and other developed countries are an order of magnitude higher than those in impoverished countries. Why should I feel sorry about the guy making $50k as a baker when he's making 10 times what the guy in India (4k/household; source Wiki list of countries by GDP)? Global income disparity is so much more important of an issue than local income disparities. Being on the low end of US income distribution means 1 fewer SUV for my family, while being on the low end of the global income disparity means my family dies because of insufficient access to vaccinations, food, shelter. The inconvenient truth is that the guys making $50k in the US that are ""struggling to get by"" are clearly in the top 1% of the global income distribution. Borrowing from the hateful rhetoric of the occupy wall street crowd, the top 1% on the global scale is clearly evil and greedy....right?

(Global outsourcing actually goes towards fixing the issue of global income inequality. Since this doesn't fit Reich's agenda well, he says that outsourcing is bad and completely ignores the fact that the programming job that is outsourced to India substantially improves the standard of living of the Indian guy who gets hired (substantially because any change in income in India is important given the low levels of consumption there).)

2.) Contrary to Reich's claims, science says that economic opportunity is as healthy as it was in the 1970's, Reich's purported golden age of equality in the movie. The author of this 2014 study? Emmanuel Saez, Berkley economist responsible for the suspension bridge income inequality study. The paper is called ""Is the United States Still a Land of Opportunity? Recent Trends in Intergenerational Mobility"" if you want to read it.

3.) The Hoover Institute recently published an article on income inequality called ""The Mismeasure of Inequality."" In this article, the Hoover Institute says that comparing differences in GROSS incomes is trivial; the relevant measure is comparing NET incomes after taxes and transfers (food stamps, tax breaks like earned income tax credit, etc). Here's a quote from the paper: ""Thus, a family claiming $22,300 in income in 2005 would have reported about $44,000 in expenditures in that year."" This comparing of GROSS incomes is irrelevant, which is the only measure of income that Reich discusses in the movie. When comparing the NET income after transfers, income disparity is much less of a problem.

In my opinion, bickering about the polarizing issue of income inequality seems fruitless. On the other hand, talking about how to educate our workforce to remain competitive in an increasingly global economy (at a reasonable price) seems a much more productive place to spend our time. This question addresses how to grow the size of the pie, not just quarreling about how to divide it.

By the way, my current income level puts my family below the poverty line, so I quality for several government transfers including the earned income tax credit, food stamps, and free health insurance. I make $25k/year gross, but close to $50k after government transfers, and I end up saving $15k/year easily, which fund my (and wife's) Roth IRAs ($11k/year).

**** edit in response to questions to my post ****
My ""free"" health care is from Medicaid. The recipe: have several kids and low income. It's the ""magic"" of redistribution at it's best. We max out the earned income tax credit at $6,044/year(google ""Taxation and the Family: What is the Earned Income Tax Credit?"" to learn more about this program), and the additional child tax credit at ~3k/year, so our tax ""return"" on $0 of taxes paid throughout the year and $25k/year in income is $9k. Add on free food to the amount of $700/month, and free bullet-proof health insurance(no premiums, copays, nothing), it adds up to a substantial subsidy. I'm sure we qualify for subsidized housing, but we prefer not to live in the ghetto so we don't do that program.

I left engineering at 90k/year to do a 5-year phd at 25k/year. After taxes and transfers, my 90k engineering gig looks like a 65k gig and my 25k phd gig looks like a 50k gig. Google ""mankiw poverty trap"" for a fascinating discussion on the issue. Remarkable to me how a 65k gross pay differential (90k-25k) turns into a 15k net pay differential.

When I explain to my brother making $50k/year that he'd be financially just as well off making $0/year (per Mankiw's chart and my personal experience) it kind of puts a damper on the whole incentives to work thing. In my opinion, incentives to work only exist above 75k or so, but not very much higher we enter the realm of 35% marginal tax rates (that's federal only which caps out at 39.6%, add state(over 10% in CA), payroll taxes(7.65% of the employee portion, or the more economically relevant measure of 15.3% which covers the total taxes since the employer covers the other half...but at the end of the day the employee indirectly pays both sides of the tax....a topic economists call ""tax incidence""), and sales tax on consumption which caps out at 10% in some states), and incentives to work are pretty much destroyed. Why people haven't faced the music and stopped working and consuming in response to these taxes, I'll never know.

Of course several people have left the labor force. Some are smart enough to have figured out how to live on low annual incomes (from savings) and actually get by without legally owing a single penny in taxes. Google ""Go Curry Cracker Never Pay Taxes Again"" for a post that rocked my my world on the subject. It's freakishly brilliant. The strategy is simply converting 401k's to Roth IRA's slowly over time to the amount of $20k/year and living off of this (tax free due to standard deduction + personal exemptions) while supplementing with up to $70k/year in dividends/capital gains from taxable accounts per the current tax laws on investments; google ""Capital gains tax in the United States"" to educate yourself on the 0% tax region.",1397865600,30,6685,4.943009795191451

6044118,2,B00G0PXU1A,"I watched this Documentary about ""Inequality"" do to the suggestion of an acquaintance, they recommended ""Forks Over Knives"" which was pretty good, and had a lot more logical info backing it up as well as case studies.

Inequality for all, while I think it does bring up an important factor about the wealth gap in the United States, and how the middle class is getting shafted, and how rather than adapt and change, people are trying to keep their standard of living and are figuratively selling their souls to do so, at least selling their lives and their kids lives away to future debt.

The documentary mainly just shows one side of the coin, figuratively speaking. It doesn't show the other things that drag people down. The only thing that the documentary seemed to focus on, was ""Poop on the rich"" ""Poop on the wealthy and big companies""...

I figured up the rate of taxes I pay (taxes by any other name, are still taxes), and it came out to be 26.5%+ is taken out of every check I bring home. That basically means, 1/4 of the year, I work for the government. That's flipping crazy. It should be 10% max, and the best it should be is 1%. And this drags me down financially, they're no splitting hairs here. It hurts.. I have school debt I am trying to pay down as quick as possible, and this huge chunk that's taken out of every pay check, stops that from happening. Its disgusting. I think this is where the term ""Wage slave"" originates, because while I can put food to the table. Pay my fuel expense to work.(1hr drive every day) with my school debt and interest eating at me.. I can't seem to do more than tread water. And I've already used up all the tactics I can do, to cut expenses. No eating out, no cable, no xm radio, no fancy phone, simple phone plan.. etc. One phone.

And that's the thing  no where in this documentary does say anything about the multitude of taxes, both direct and indirect, including inflation(A huge hidden tax)... that the working individual has to deal with, basically the middle class. (disclaimer this review was written several days after watching the documentary, so watch it yourself to get the details) Instead, its just harps that people aren't paid enough. I would argue that if people got to keep their entire pay checks.. They would have enough to save up and live a better life. It would be even easier to climb the socioeconomic rungs of life. The reason I mention this, is because no matter how much more I get paid per hour, the state I live in, has an income tax, so they are going to get a larger percentage of my money, the harder I work. So I don't get anywhere new by being paid more is what I am saying. Because on top of the income taxes, you pay other taxes.. so.. basically you end up where you started out at. Your getting drained of your productivity basically, more or less to simplify it.

It does mention in the documentary about ""Campaign contributions"".. both for Democrats and Republicans... and how this negatively effects our government, and leads to things like corporate bail outs and what have you. (no poop Sherlock)

The only thing this documentary manages to do.. is either upset you, or depress you, or a combo of both. For my friend, it did the combo, for me, it kinda made me bored mainly because I've studied history, and I've studied economics (as a ""hobby"")... and that's why I say, this documentary only shows you half the story.

A long time ago, people used to save up money, mainly because it wasn't devalued around 97% of its value.. and you could actually save it up for a rainy day, or a nice treat for yourself. The documentary doesn't talk about this.. The only thing it does, is point to 1970'ish and say ""Something important happened around here"".. but it never elaborates on what could have possibly happened here. (Gold, silver, real money, being separated from the dollar) In life bad things are going to happen, good opportunities are going to present themselves. It's important to save up for these times. Our grandparents grandparents realized this.. and today, our economy is like the Documentary says, based on consumption and flow of cash, whether its logic or not. We just gotta keep the ""money"" (read currency) moving, keep the spending happening.. and if we can't do this were screwed and our economy declines and people suffer. So we need ever more continuous growth,.. doesn't make sense.. and I guess it kinda explains the re-occurring boom and bust cycles we have in the united states? maybe? Where we have recessions and depressions ever so many years.

6044140,1,B00G0PXU1A,"You need to understand who Reich is and what the Secretary of Labor is. Once you do you will view this video differently.

First of all Reich is not intellectually honest. In a previous book he was caught manufacturing quotations from opponents which he then refuted. As far as I know he has never apologized for that.

Secondly the Department of Labor was invented to represent the interests of organized labor just as the Department of Commerce was invented to represent the interests of the business community. These organizations are not disinterested impartial academic-like agencies. They are advocates for the economic interests of their constituents. Reich is not impartial and neutral. His career has always been as a partisan for the big labor point of view. He makes the best arguments he can for labor's interests.

Third Reich is not an economist. He is a lawyer. He basically presents the 'talking points' of labor's case. He does not make economic analyses based on his own research. He is an advocate who presents the canned arguments of big labor and the Democratic party.

Fourth Reich is a Marxist. His stance on income inequality is based on the arguments that Karl Marx made more than a century and a half ago. Anyone who has studied economics has heard the Marxist line before. But modern economists have dismissed these notions for the most part. Like many Marxist ideas they still hold power over the general public but serious academic economists don't think this way anymore.

Finally Reich fails to face up to many known problems. He does not for example mention race.  The US has at least two minority populations - blacks and Hispanics -  who under perform. Nation's like Japan or Sweden that are more racially and culturally uniform will not have as much inequality. Reich conceals these kind of differences. He tends to attribute inequality to the greed of a few people. But if anything, today's capitalists are less greedy than those of the past.  Reich seems to be laying the ground work for a system of income distribution which relies on the federal government to pick favorites. Reich tries to make a case that having the feds in charge is more 'progressive' and more 'fair'.

But the central distribution of income, benefits and contracts is in fact not modern at all. That's the way it was done in the late Middle Ages. There used to be royal charters for everything from strawberry jam to the right to rule India. Everyone competed for access to the throne. The modern version is called crony capitalism.

Inequality is indeed a problem but Reich isn't an impartial student of economics. He is an advocate for a political clique that hopes to profit greatly from a restructuring of the marketplace.",1395878400,24,2737,4.866666666666666

He convincingly claims that the current rates of inequality constitute a threat to democracy and to USA's competitiveness in the global economy. The video is very well produced; complex ideas are illustrated with graphs and plain English explanations. Reich is an experienced communicator who manages to present himself as an accessible speaker. This video can be understood by high school students as well as homemakers.

While trying to find a Sociology grad student from UC Berkeley to interview, one of them recommended this documentary. I had actually read his foreword from ""The Spirit Level"" so I was excited to hear about this.

ACTUAL REVIEW (spoilers included): Income inequality is a complex issue that Robert Reich tackles in a no-BS type of way. I've read books including the one I've stated above, ""The Price of Inequality"", and ""Unintended Consequences,"" all of which I recommend. Anyone can benefit from watching this. He narrates this topic beginning with comparisons of incomes between the 1%  and average worker in the years 1978 and 2010. Then follows with parallels of 1928 and 2007, being the peak years of income concentration. That is the extent of my spoilers.

Whoever you are, watch it - it's worth it. I'm not saying buy it (pretty expensive), but take the time to view the entire 90 minutes. I've watched it three times already, and it's still enjoyable.

Where does the wonderful Professor teach: in the most bankrupt state in the Union.  When was he in Government with Ford, the most liberal Republican EVER, then with Carter, the worst President ever and then Clinton, the president that absolutely SOLD THE UNIONS DOWN THE RIVER (Commanding Heights, Pulitzer Prize 2002).  He seems to have no clue that this is and never has been a Democracy, it is a Representative Republic. No where does Prof. Reich once call it a Republic.  He says he is not a Socialist, but then I also suspect he doesn't know what a Socialist is.  Because he IS a Socialist.  A Socialist is one that believes in a government that controls the money and distribution of wealth. Keynes is a Socialist and I suspect that every economist at Berekely is a Socialist. They simply don't say it because the average person would think the USSR. Reich and most Democrats are socialists.  They want your money and they want to control where it goes. My only real concern is that all those young faces at that age, totally believe him and as the young man said ""he inspires me"". If they don't know the truth about LBJ and the Great Society which is the ONLY reason we are in so much trouble today and yes, the Democrats want people to think its a Democracy; in another word thats MOB RULE.  If only we had not approved the 17th Amendment we would still have some sane heads in the Senate, we also turned them over to mob rule. The question is, ""Is the Republic doomed?

He ends on a high-note, using the country itself as an example in turning things around.  Personally, I'd like to believe that he's right--but fear that the current polarization and extremism, coupled with downward pull of a nation in decline, might just be too much to overcome.

I also liked the fact that he takes some of the blame for what happened on behalf of the Clinton Administration, stating that the Administration lacked the political will to reverse the trends toward growing inequality. He also calls out the Treasury Department without calling Robert Rubin by name, with whom Reich quarreled with frequently over economic policies and their implications.

Those who are making a middle income or lower, out of pride or necessity have used up virtually every last hand hold on the bottom rung of the economic ladder. It hurts to think that even though you may work two jobs, you can't do more than just break even. It is like trying to scale a sheer glass wall. The raises that the top tier (1%) get are from the economies of scale created by not giving you a raise, or benefits, or opportunity to improve yourself. What we have now is a form of involuntary servitude with a very long leash. Now, the leash is starting to shorten, and the collar has been taken in another notch. This is not a socialist viewpoint. This is reality. Please, do yourself a favor, and watch this movie. It should be required viewing for every Economics 101 class in every college in our nation.

There are patterns of activity, taxation, and other economic measures that make a good case that improving the earnings and stability of the middle class will strengthen the country.

The wealthy control the rules and make the rules for Wall Street by electing government officials who will make decisions in their favor, thinking that this will help them save more money.  They save the money they earn and invest internationally, which does not help the US economy.  The middle class income levels out and declines.  The wealthy's income continues to increase, but they do not spend their money in the US, hence the economy stagnates and eventually will have a crash again as Reich shows has happened throughout history.

 the end of WW!! to now.  The documentation is accurate and may surprise many Americans.  No American can consider him/herself  politically literate without being familiar with these facts. And without being politically literate, we will always be victims of the existing political/social structure which is not set up to serve the middle class nor the 99% in general.
My only criticism is that there were not more solutions offered besides raising the minimum wage. To my mind, the political consciousness of our citizens  has to be raised tremendously,  so they can see that they are not getting the real news

The wealthy don't spend the same way the working people spend.  Working people buy what is made from other people who work.  Wealthy people move their money in a way to only make more money, not more jobs.  Robert Reich is an intelligent man who understands and explains well what we need to do in this country.

6044214,5,B00G0PXU1A,"This is an excellent documentary. It admits it has a viewpoint and does not hide it: That there is economic inequality and that this inequality can be harmful to our economy and our democracy. Yet it is neither preachy nor boring academic although it does fall more on the academic side. What is good about this documentary is it backs its arguments with facts and statistics. People may still wish to argue interpretations of the numbers, but this film makes solid arguments without being preachy nor melodramatic, as some failed documentaries do.

Viewers learn that household wages rose from the 1940s to the late 1970s and then began dropping after that. The wage increases were helped by an increased graduations from higher education that made the U.S. the most educated country which in turn led the U.S. to be the most economically productive nation. There was a similar growth in unions which protected wage growth.

In the late 1970s, the I.R.S. allowed companies to deduct executive pay based on performance. This resulted in an increase in greater compensation to executive with stagnant pay to other employees. In the 1980s, taxes on the wealthiest Americans were reduced to levels seen before the depression. Unions faltered and many wage protections were removed. The financial industry experienced increased growth as law changes permitted increased speculation that brought them wealth yet did little to create new product snd more jobs. By 2008 the disparity in economic wealth was similar to that which existed before the depression of 1929.

Household spending had kept pace even as housing, education, and health care costs continually grew faster than the inflation rates. Households achieved this by the historic entrance of women into the labor force, by people on average working longer hours, and by households taking on increased debt. Consumer debt reached $500 billion by 1929.

As in the depression, there was another economic crash in 2008. The country has seen a revival in stock market prices. Yet nearly all of the increased wealth has gone to the wealthiest people.

Economic growth occurs when the middle class and poor spend money which increases demand for more products which produces more jobs. This creates an upward cycle of growth. Concentrating wealth in a few people who do not spend as much money creates a downwards cycle of economic downfalls.

This creates a threat to our economy, this film argues. The wealthiest Americans are investing more in lobbyists and in campaign contributions to politicians who are keeping tax rates on the wealthy are kept low. A 2010 Supreme Court ruling now allows unlimited amounts of funds to flow to candidates. The lower taxes paid by the wealthy reduces public sector revenues which in turn leads to cuts in spending on public education and higher education. The education levels overall decline which diminishes the productivity of our labor force. This results in lower wages and further lowers public sector revenues and the downward cycle continues.

I found this movie informative. I suspect many will bring their prior biases and political beliefs to when they view this film and their reactions may be in accordance to their prior conceptions. I would urge people to have an open mind when viewing this movie and to think of more questions on these economic issues to which we should seek further answers.",1393286400,,3397,5.087971274685817

Robert Reich is a charming fellow with a sharp mind who, one might think, also would have a sharp tongue. But rather than slash those on the opposite side of the issue, Reich duels like a gentlemen who knows that cooperation is the only way to advance his agenda in the long run. We see Reich's lecture hall at UC Berkeley where he amazes, amuses and challenges his students. And we take a series of short visits into Reich's impressive past, beginning with his early friendship with fellow Rhodes scholar Bill Clinton, all the way through his many stints in government service, right up to the sometimes friendly, now hostile reception he has received at FOX News.

Staunch believers in the ""American Dream,"" which is usually translated as ""becoming wealthy,"" the middle class resents the unchecked power of the super-rich over it yet desperately wants to join its ranks. So the middle class is hopelessly divided: one-half wants justice; the other half wants wealth (for proof, consider the millions who spend millions on ludicrously long-shot lotteries every week). So the middle class is mired in an endless, internecine war with itself--much to the bemusement of the plutocrats, who rationalize their greed and excess on the presumption that if the middle class ever does become as wealthy as them, the middle class would act even more avariciously and behave more heinously.

There are exceptions, but many 1% individuals also develop Libertarian viewpoints in judging folks in fiscally inferior standing.  In real time I do not intend to judge individuals and feel the best way to ensure that the system is just is to apply a progressive tax policy that targets income and wealth in amounts that all pay an amount that reflects how they have benefited from our economic system.  Thus our infrastructure, social security program, national security, public safety, etc. are funded to benefit the common good.

6044276,4,B00G0PXU1A,"I really wanted to give this movie a 5-star review. I think Robert Reich has consistently and skillfully argued for policies to reduce economic equality for as long as I can remember. This movie clearly outlines the problem of the historically wide income gap between the median income earner and the 1% earners and how that creates a perpetual economic drag.  Reich loses a star because other than more taxes for the wealthy, he is short on policy prescriptions.  Tellingly, though he identifies globalization and technological change as reasons for stagnating wages, he doesn't suggest how workers can counter those trends other than getting ""education"".  Americans now are getting a lot of education that doesn't help them in the job market.  An 18-year-old picking a major is not likely to have a high success rate in determining what field will be in demand 10 years, 20 years, 30 years in the future. A company might need machine tool operators, but if the company gets to direct public education dollars, that company will want to train two or more tool operators for each job to keep the price of labor down.

Reich also touts the effects of unions in raising the earnings of the median workers. I'm pro-union,  but the unions have a lot of work to do to sign up the employee who's company is already threatening to move the jobs offshore if wage concessions aren't made.  I suppose you have to limit your scope if you want to make a movie that is watchable and that is a reasonable length.  Watch this movie to get a good overview of the problem. Don't watch the movie expecting a solution.",1391731200,,1599,4.706093189964157

6044278,5,B00G0PXU1A,"Robert Reich's critique of economic inequality and its consequences is well worth viewing, for it is entirely factually based.  It is hard to deny reality, though some continue to. It is also true that Reich tries to soften his harsh message with many biographical asides, so that parts of the film suggest selfies. But that device is only a means for getting his student audience at Berkeley and now a national audience to study the facts of the matter: the most massive disparity of wealth and poverty since before the Great Depression.  If most Americans are too poor to consume the goods and services for sale, what profiteth the society, except of course for the very, very few who can buy anything they want.",1391731200,,714,4.75

6044290,5,B00G0PXU1A,"There is a hidden truth about freedom. Well, it isn't really hidden, its in plain view, yet hardly noticed. Freedom is tied to economic equality. Freedom is tied to a degree of wealth. When a person no longer struggles to feed and clothe themselves and their loved ones, they can then gain knowledge, participate in societal activities, including government, as well as develop creative endeavors. During the 20th century Americans were able to send themselves in record numbers to college and thus developed a smarter workforce which pushed us into becoming a world economic powerhouse. Americans participated in politics because they were more informed, and had the time to explore the data given to them and debate this data. Things are starting to change, however, and not for the better.

 I have been trying to stay informed about current economy for awhile now. This has interested me not just because of how it effects history, but how it will effect the politics of my home. Plus, I lost my job in 2008, couldn't continue my education and have found myself on the low end of the wage graph with a bachelors that has left me in massive debt. I wanted to know why. I wanted to know why I couldn't get paid more. I wanted to know why some people made so much money while others lived hand to mouth in such a wealthy nation. I wanted to know why everything in America was so much more expensive than anywhere else in the world, even when the good or service being purchased was American made. I think many people want to know why and they need a place to start. The documentary Inequality For All, directed by Jacob Kornbluth, and featuring the economics work of former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich, may be just the starting point so many need.

 The film is somewhat centered around Reichs class on economics, so it plays out like a lecture, in a way. There are scenes that are lifted straight out of his class. Than you will follow him to talk to other political figures he is friends with, but there are many times where it is just him explaining points. He shares a little air time with Nick Hanauer, a successful entrepreneur who is using his wealth to become a benevolent billionaire, like Buffet and Gates. Hanauer started making waves a few years ago with a TED Talk about income inequality. Outside of these interviews there are many moments of graphs and power point like fact listing, but all is delivered in an easy to understand manner. Reich finds the way to communicate effectively what seems to be so complicated for news media to explain. For anyone truly starting to understand these issues, there are plenty of jaw dropping facts. If you have been unaware up until now of what has been going in the melding of politics and money, prepare to be shocked. If, however, you are one of the few paying attention, you really won't be all that shocked. However, you will find some tools to help explain it to others, or you can just have them watch the movie.

 There is one main underlining point in all that Reich discusses. As the middle class crumbles, more and more Americans will fall into a vicious cycle that they, nor their children, will be able to climb out of. Poverty will become the norm, and education will take a back seat to being a warm body at a remedial job. While this happens, the rich will get richer and continue to use their money to influence how the American government works. Because Americans will be too poor and undereducated they will be too weak to effectively fight off this corporate take over our civil liberties. In short, our freedom is tied to our ability to educate and cultivate ourselves, and we cant do that as poor third world citizens.

 This isn't a communist manifesto, as so many would have you believe. Reich is talking about fairness, ethical business and economic practices that have no politics, but simply work. The film stresses this point, the economic problems we are facing today have nothing to do with politics. There are ways to get what we need out of the economy and since is it not a natural phenomena, we can shape it however we choose. The tool to shape the economy lies within government regulation, however, one can not create reasonable regulations when corporate money, through lobbyist, is flooding the branches of government and shaping all to their advantage. A strong middle class not only drives our economy but also our democracy.

 In short, I feel everyone should become more informed on these issues. These economic issues will end up deciding the limits of our civil liberties in the future. Just take a look at what large corporations are attempting to do with Net Neutrality, or the businesses that make money off of a highly armed police force, and private prisons. Consider how green initiatives have been stalled time and time again because law makers have been under the thumb of oil barons. Think of all the debt we have been saddled with, from student to medical. We have become slaves to wealthier masters and have lost our upward mobility.  How will we ever have the time and resources to protest for the changes needed when we have such a hard time feeding our families? The father of Aung San Suu Kyi, Aung San, once said that; While you don't think about politics, politics thinks about you. The government, which is no longer under our control thinks a great deal about us. We the people, need to start thinking about it and how we can once again have a government for us, by us. Robert Reich has hope that it is not too late, I am hoping with him.",1391472000,,5560,4.628803245436106

His illustrations are very clear. For example, he shows a picture of a suspension bridge, with two tall support structures near each end, and then he juxtaposes on the bridge a graph of income inequality. One end of the graph shows the period starting before the Great Depression, and the other end shows the recent Great Financial Crisis. The graph closely mirrors the supports of the bridge, clearly showing a high correlation between income inequality and profound economic instability. The image of the bridge makes it easy to remember.

Having a multimillionaire business owner weigh in for this story adds a compelling argument in pointing out that these folks have so much dough that they have no Idea where most of it is.  The investing process becomes a big game at this level, but this guy understands that you can only eat so many meals, get a limited number of haircuts, wear so many clothes, and drive only one car at a time with all this extra money, so most of the money just sits and accumulates. I doubt that the Waltons see things this way. Only Michael Moore, with his movie making chops and legendary history in doing this sort of thing, could've put this over the top as a 5 star blockbuster.

I wish more people would see a film like this and it is able to use a lot of facts to prove its point. The only thing I will say is that it sorta shows a bias against automation.

But the filmmakers focused too heavily on Reich as a personality and the adulation gets to be a bit off-putting.  I like Reich!  But do I have to be hit over the head with how great he is?  I thought this was supposed to be about inequality.  I think the film (and Reich) oversimplifies issues a bit but overall it's very worth watching and sharing.  (Regarding oversimplification, did Reich REALLY think he was going to be able to influence life-long working class mid-western Republicans to join a union, simply by presenting compelling data and facts?  No one operates that way -- not even the most rational among us.  These are emotional decisions, emotional affiliations, emotional reactions.

It challenges the premise that if we all just allow the rich to be become richer our economic problems will be solved. Only a fascinating personality like Reich could have sustained interest in this fairly mundane topic for ninety minutes. My criticism would be that it was a little light on solutions, probably because there aren't any good ones. It also glossed over the fact that when inequality was low we, as consumers, did not have anything like the purchasing options that we have enjoyed in recent years. Still, the next time some politician remarks that income inequality is the inevitable result of the innate genius of the super rich or that trickle down economics works for the middle class, those of us who have been fortunate enough to see this movie may ask "" Are you sure about that?"".",1390089600,,890,4.711538461538462

6044352,5,B00G0PXU1A,"In the movie Robert Reich uses some of his personality to discuss the sometimes dry topic of economics and how it affects everyone. His use of historical data such as stock market pricing, flow of national GDP, education levels, tax rates, and national debt effectively cuts through all of the rhetoric of both sides of the current political argument. If this use of historical data was sufficient enough, the example he uses of Iphone manufacturing is very eye-opening.

Over 45% of the current Iphone is made in Germany, a country with higher taxes, higher wages, yet a lower unemployment. By their dispassionate and calculated business decisions, Apple demonstrates that a highly educated middle class combined with business reinvestments outperforms our current system of short term profits and wealth flowing upward. Apple is not using Germany because they want to; it just makes the most economic sense.

Hopefully this movie will help cut through the misinformation and childish terms (like ""job creators"") and allow real discussions to be held.

The information he provides is substantive and valid due to his education, years of experience as Labor Secretary and time in the beltway.  While passionate about his subject, he is not offensive and presents his material in a way that is straightforward yet interesting.  He makes his point not by using media generated talking points and hot button reactionary language, but by presenting the historical context of how we got in our current economic mess.

6044382,5,B00G0PXU1A,"I'm going up on my soapbox for a minute. I just watched a documentary called Inequality for All. IMHO, this film should be mandatory viewing for every American citizen of voting age. And let's take it a step or two further by making it mandatory for both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate. In fact, I think the eyes of the congress people and senators should be held open (remember Clockwork Orange?) while they are forced to watch this film about 100 times until they FINALLY understand just what the (BLEEP) they are doing to this country with their tear-down policies.

The tea party, when it started out, actually held to the philosophies of the middle class of this country. For the betterment and advancement of the middle class. For the strength and equality of the middle class. For the power of the people and the people's government.  The middle class is what makes this country strong.  Without a strong middle class, our society begins to crumble.  The extremists who have taken those grassroots efforts and bastardized them to reflect the greed and desires of the 1% is outrageous and needs to be stopped.

There was one woman in the film who really impressed me with her heartfelt plea. She is a registered Republican and a Mormon...very conservative in her politics and ideas. She said, quote: ""If you have ten million dollars, if you have one billion dollars...why do you need that little bit that is mine?"", unquote. Those words said it all!  Big business, big CEO's....with all your millions and billions, why do you need more? What can you possibly do with more? You're certainly not recycling it back to the workers of this country.

I don't think anyone disputes the fact that there is inequality of income, but America provides more opportunity than anyone else.  It's more of an equality of opportunity vs equality of outcome thing.  You can't guarantee equality without things devolving to an old socialist style of governance.  We all know how that ends up, lots and lots of death.  This is just the wedge issue of the day and Reich is a pusher and profiteer off of it.  Good for him.  I wonder if his income is equal to mine, or yours, or most others?  Of course not, he and his brethren of I promise I am looking out for you, pay me your hard earned dollars, and I tell you how.",1389312000,16,792,4.297297297297297

6044388,5,B00G0PXU1A,"Robert Reich does a 1967 style ""Vietnam War teach in"" on the subject of income inequality in the US, what it is, how it came about, why it is pernicious to our economy, democracy and way of life.  We've heard a lot on this topic since the ""Occupy"" movement, but Reich drills deep in this documentary, based on his Berkeley lectures, but including other subjects, ordinary people, politicians, and tycoons.

The most interesting tycoon depicted is the CEO of Pacific Pillows, who realized belatedly that the ""CEO as job creator"" myth and ""I'm a maker, you're a moocher"" ideology of most billionaires (think Mitt Romney) with humility that he was not a master of the universe, but rather the consumers that could no longer afford to buy his pillows.

I'm a political person who reads Paul Krugman (and agrees with him) so much of this is old news to me, especially since Occupy and Citizens United, but there were some surprising ""dots"" here which Reich connects, like the country which provides the most ""value added"" content to an iPhone is not China (3%) as I supposed, but Germany.

The documentary is fairly entertaining as well, as a work of education and political agitation, rather than the typical escapism of ""narrative"" movies and TV shows.

However, after the problem is explained and diagnosed, Reich offers no solutions or easy answers.  He implies this has changed before either peacefully (progressives and FDR in US) or not (revolutions, social unrest) but offers no prescriptions or predictions.  The one shocking and somewhat depressing end is presented as uplifting, when at the end of the film (spoilers alert) Reich implicitly turns over the problem to the younger generations, his students, with the notion that they will figure out a solution somehow.

The film's one call to action is at the end where a text number and website address is given where those interested can stay in touch with future political organizing efforts (the first of which is a Move On petition to increase fast food workers wages to $15/hr).",1389225600,4,2039,4.906976744186046

He poses some great questions that really make one think about the current state of the middle class, but doesn't necessarily leave us with any silver lining. Is there any hope looking forward? Will the middle class ever recover to a fraction of what it once was? While Mr. Reich brilliantly lays out the decline of the middle class, I'm not necessarily left with any feeling of hope, but instead, more a feeling that it will just linger on in its current state, while the 1% continue to prosper on. Definitely worth watching, Mr. Reich's natural charisma clearly comes across and as he attempts to educate us in hopes of making a difference for a better tomorrow.",1389139200,7,727,4.6875

So if an able bodied person does not work and depends upon those who do to subsist... why is that not inequality or theft?
Reich has made a career out of being a ultra progressive left wing liberal, becoming wealthy by complaining about the wealthy.
Can no one see the hypocrisy of this movie, otherwise should it not be handed out for free at an occupy the pavement event?

6044396,2,B00G0PXU1A,"Absolutely typical Robert Reich.  You could have just read or watched anything else he's done in the past.  Here's the thing.  He wanted to make money.  That's where all of these pseudo-docs are just big fat frauds.  They are a part of the system they rail against.  The world has been overrun with awful liberal ""documentaries"".  A documentary is when you go out, with no agenda, film what is happening, and then after filming come to a conclusion based on what you have documented.  These days, the Reichs, Moores, Spurlocks, Gores, etc, of the world go out and create a film that leads to the conclusion that they are trying to reach.  It's a joke and honestly insulting to the real documentarians of the world, and stops real honest filmmakers from earning acclaim they should get.  Their format is hijacked by folks who are famous and steal attention from them for financial gain.  Just look at the fortunes that have been made by the aforementioned ""documentarians"". Truth is I wasted only about 35 minutes of my time on the film, luckily.

Edit/update:  if you read this review check out the comments. That's who this film is for. Also maybe those who have no prior knowledge of Reich's opinions and want to see what he's all about. It's not a terrible idea to watch even if you don't think you'll agree so you can see him lay out his arguments. Best wishes.

Second revision:  for all the people talking about oh, the profits, the humanity.  Businesses cannot stay in business without profits, and lots of it.  If they do not take advantage while they can, all it takes is one or two bad quarters and they're done.  Jobs gone, everyone out on their butts.  I don't know about most people but, I'd rather have a job where the boss makes a whole lot more than I do than not have a job at all.  Also, so much of this profit is phony paper profit that exists in share prices only.  Which is a result of the current administrations policy, inequality has gone up more under them than at any other time.  The true problem is burdensome regulations keeping people from opening and expanding their businesses. Reich is a likeable guy, he's been ahead of the curve with this, as it is now become the cause du jour.  It's hilarious listening to millionaires talk about income inequality.  Some of them mean what they say, like Reich, who I believe to be a genuine person, also a celebrity, but professor/theorist type first, some celebs though like with all causes do themselves and their cause a disservice by offering their opinion or ""help"".  Anyhow, if you want to be mad at profits, feel free, but without profits, their would be no jobs.  Before you say oh the profits are growing/obscene etc, that's just for now.  Not all companies are always profitable and if they are they are consistent employers of people and if you are anti-profit you are anti-job.",1388102400,18,2860,4.6118811881188115
6044397,5,B00G0PXU1A,"I saw this film twice at the independent cienemas. It is an excellent film that has structure, organization, and an unfolding plot from the distinguished University of California, Berkeley professor of economics. Dr. Reich is funny, engaging, critical, realistic, and humane in his moral message about the current crisis of the U.S. income gap and growth of poverty in the United States. More than a simple documentary about the economic state of the union, Inequality for All also follows Professor Reich's development as an economist, former Secretary of Labor under Clinton, and his most recent profession as a Professor of Economics and Policy at UC Berkeley.

As a social studies high school teacher who teaches Government and Economics courses--and a who has a graduate degree in philosophy--I strongly recommend this film to anybody who wants an accessible understanding of how our current capitalist economic system requires a major shiftin in ideology and policy-making. Professor Reich is obviously a leftist, but he is a responsible leftist who understands what radical economic policy will not be immediate, and hence needs to be progressive. Furthermore, this film ends with a positive and optimistic message.

This is a film that I will be showing for my Economics and Government courses and it would be great to incorporate for our Common Core State Standards.",1386979200,87,1375,5.273972602739726

The film made me like and respect Reich more, as it included a bit of his personal background. However, on the minus side, I would say this film focuses a bit too much on Reich's model of how economic growth works, rather than addressing any of the actual concepts of monetary policy. I think the film would be more effective if it could explain how the ""flattened wages"" statistic fits into a broader set of neoliberal policies. Students are asking me after we view the film, ""but WHY do wages remain flat?"" and it would be nice to answer with something other than ""CEOs don't want to share the wealth.""",1527120000,,936,4.610778443113772
