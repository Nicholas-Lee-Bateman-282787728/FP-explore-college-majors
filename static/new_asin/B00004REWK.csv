1342967,4,B00004REWK,"One of my favorite movies of all time. Hume Croyn and Jessica Tandy were the perfect choices to star in this movie. Their love (real) is tangible throughout this film. You really get drawn into the story from the very beginning and it keeps your attention, right to the end. Not something that happens often enough, especially with the movies they are producing now.

I'm taking off one star as I did get a bit tired of all the references to sickness, aches and pains...it would have been nice if they had been portrayed as healthier older people; that part got tiresome. Overall though, a real treat.

One more thing, the dog(s) in this film (I'm guessing there were at least 2) were AMAZING!!! It would have been nice to have them mentioned in the credits. Without the white dog, this film would not have happened.

Buy it, you won't regret it, if you love enduring, sweet love stories. But DO have the tissues handy. I always cry when I watch this movie.",1432080000,,957,4.520231213872832

1343019,5,B00004REWK,"Wonderful, heartwarming film!  I happened to be in Americus, GA, when it was shot, and was staying at the same hotel downtown as most of the cast.  At night the actors would gather in the hotel's dining room with the rest of us for dinner.  There were very nice and it was fun to meet some of the principals.  One of them, perhaps Christine Baranski, was in the room next to mine and I could hear her in the evening running her lines, getting ready for the next day's shooting.

1343059,5,B00004REWK,"I first saw this on a VHS tape over 15 years ago an I had to buy it an it took me a long time to find it again an I did at a flea market in Peru Indiana.. Since then several friends of mine have asked borrow it to watch because it is a truly beautiful love story of these two people an there family. So now that I have found it on Amazon needless to say I was extremely thrilled. This movie will touch your heart an sometimes bring tears to your eyes, but in the same way make you smile, an clap your hands....
What I don't understand is I have never it seen it in any rental / video stores in the all time classics section because it definately should be. I am also curious as to why the Hallmark channel never shows it. But I really believe anyone that is truly into family value movies, would want this to be a part of there collection. I truly hope that everyone will get this movie an post a review about it.

1343075,1,B00004REWK,"I have been instructed by the live chat line to submit a feedback about this product in here.
I tried to order this DVD but it will not send it to my address. The issue is to do with the region of the DVD.

The DVD is region 1 and I am in Australia region 4. This I know, but why does the ordering system REFUSE to send it to me? I HAVE a region free player, I HAVE ordered region 1 DVDs from amazon before... So what is the problem?

Something has obviously changed in the way the program cross references items to areas but I think you need to fix this problem! Why is an ordering system restricting me from obtaining a DVD because of different regioning? Is it trying to prevent me from making a silly mistake? Or is it just poor programming?

I can play that DVD here, please send it to me!!!",1351036800,,796,4.057324840764331

1343078,5,B00004REWK,"My sister gave this to me for Christmas, knowing I had seen it on TV and loved it. It shares a similarity with another movie this couple made called Firefox also starring John Denver as their son. The title To Dance With the White Dog comes from an unwelcome gift to an aging widower, Mr. Peek, in the form of a walker. He tries it out just to please his son but his face tells us he does not like it until a strange white dog who had come out of nowhere earlier in the movie to become his friend places her forepaws on the bars and actually dances with him. We watch as Peek tries to bake the biscuits his departed wife did so well, and try to convince his family of the dog's existence. He sets off on a road trip with just his dog for company and winds up in need of family help. When the movie nears its end, well, you will just have to watch the movie, so full of family members giving all sorts of advice and cautions to the patriarch who is not about to listen to any of them. It will tug at your heartstrings, so be prepared to shed tears while laughing and crying, and enjoy another winner from the Tandy-Cronyn team.",1307750400,,1126,4.099547511312217

1343098,5,B00004REWK,"Several years ago my mom told me about this lovely ""Hallmark"" movie she had seen on tv.  I looked for it, when I thought to, but never saw it in the stores.  This year I decided it HAD to be my Mother's Day gift to her and I would find it.  It took less than 5 minutes to discover it on Amazon, and less than that to order it; in 2 days it arrived, in plenty of time for Mother's Day.  We watched it together and as both of us are women of a ""certain age""--I'm almost 60 and she's almost 80--it was intensely meaningful on many levels.  The setting is beautiful, the actors perfect in their roles but what brought it all together, for my mom and me,dedicated dog lovers that we are, is the white dog--her heart-breakingly sweet face and what she symbolizes.  This movie was a real moment for us in a special time in our lives together.",1242604800,3,835,4.15527950310559
1343099,5,B00004REWK,"To Dance With The White Dog is one of my favorite movies ever. It is the story of Sam and Cora Peeke who have been married for 57 years. When Cora dies Sam is befriended by a white dog who stays with him through his last days. What makes this movie so poignant is that Jessica Tandy and Humn Cronyn were married for fifty plus years like the characters and the year this was released Jessica Tandy died of cancer. THis movie really celebrates a special love these two characters had and at the same time shows the relationships with their children and the issues faced by a lot of older people- losing a spouse, health declining, and maintaining independence. To me the movie was about how love can live forever and that the magic between two people will live on. Jessica Tandy was luminious in this movie- she just glowed and was so amazing and elegant- what a class act- both of them are. Humn Cronyn was very good as well as Sam Peek. It was so bittersweet watching Jessica Tandy in the DVD extras talking about life and how it should be enjoyed such a short time before her death. God bless both of them and I am sure they are together right now. Have some tissues nearby when you watch this movie!",1228003200,6,1202,4.346666666666667
1343100,5,B00004REWK,"This is one of those rare movies which should be on everyone's list of movies.

As always, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy delivered performances which were sincere and deep, and brushed with the humor and affection they were renown for.

Watch this with someone you love, or watch it alone, but make sure you have a box of tissues in either case.  In the end, what matters is there are no ends, just discoveries.",1199491200,3,411,4.527027027027027
1343101,5,B00004REWK,"If you enjoyed ""Foxfire"" or ""The Dollmaker"", you will love this too. If you have seen this already be sure to check the other two I mentioned. Susan Cooper is an outstanding writer to have written such great stories of how people cope with lifes events. Some wonderful and some heartbreaking, we learn to move on and embrace the best of what we have had and lost. Cronyn and Tandy are perfect for their roles and will draw you into this story as though it happened to you. This is one of the best Hallmark has to offer. I watched this and ""Foxfire"" with my mom a couple years after my dad passed away. I have to say they both had a profound affect on me. They will heighten your appreciation for your parents. I highly recommend it.",1138838400,5,732,4.311594202898551
1343102,5,B00004REWK,"This is quite an exceptional drama that will stay with you for a long time.  It stars Hume Cronyn as Sam, a farmer, who's beloved wife of fifty years, Cora, has died.  The couple were devoted to each other in life, and Cora's spirit,  in the form of a beautiful white dog, returns to look after Sam and help him in his time of grief.  The old man is greatly comforted by the dog, whom he alone can see, and as his own health ebbs, he faces his own death with anticipation, for he knows he will see his Cora again.

Was there ever a better acting couple than Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn?  Their life experiences etched into every line of their gentle faces, and their real love evident in their eyes, their performances bring not only tears, but also a sense of awe for their profound talents.  They play simple people with such charisma that you simply cannot take your eyes off of them.  The script is guaranteed to tug at your heartstrings and send the hopeful message that death is not necessarily the end for those who truly love.  A memorable film; heartily recommended.",1095033600,16,1077,4.426395939086294
1343103,5,B00004REWK,"This is one of the best.  When elderly widower Sam Peak befriends a stray white dog that no one else can see the family is sure he is becoming senile.  Everyone that is but the maid who asserts that it must be a ghost dog and that no good can come of it.  She's seen it before.  The dog will surely lead Sam to his death. When a strong willed Sam decides to take the dog with him on an out of town trip to his high school reunion (without the knowledge of his two overprotective daughters), it sure looks like she might be right.  But appearances can be deceiving.
This is a heart warming and perfectly portrayed movie of the strength and endurance of love beyond all bounds. Guaranteed to make you cry and smile at the same time.",1063065600,11,730,4.185714285714286

The first time my husband and I saw this movie is when our grade-school children bought it for us for our 10th wedding anniversary as a surprise.  I know...how sweet.  One of my favorite movies ever!  Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn...it doesn't get much better.  What epic acting!  Ok...it might be Hallmark sappy, but sometimes that is exactly what we need in this often-cruel and sad world.  I love the message:  marriage is a good thing.  My husband loves it too, and he is no wimp by any stretch of the imagination.  :)",1473984000,,582,4.40566037735849
