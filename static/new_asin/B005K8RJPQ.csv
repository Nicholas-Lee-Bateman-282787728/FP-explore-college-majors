8476660,5,B005K8RJPQ,I love any video with the Von Erichs. Yeah we know they were a bunch of screw-ups but it was fun while it lasted. I guess their story is so interesting to me because of the unfulfilled promise and thought of what could have been. World class championship Wrestling was great in  those early parts of the 80s and the Sportatorium was the place to be. The director did a good job for what he had to work with. Gary Hart and Skandor Akbar steal the show on this video!,1446422400,,465,4.166666666666667

8476662,4,B005K8RJPQ,A very interesting story of the family that wrestled together. It was very sad how everyone died so young and didn't get to see their family grow.,1390176000,2,146,4.444444444444445

To Whom It May Concern:

 order# 1017782 thru Amazon US

On 8/20/13 I ordered World Class Championship Wrestling the Von Erich Story.  I received it about a week later.  I am VERY disappointed. First I paid $7.94 for it but on the case was clearance sticker for a $1.00. Second when I went to play it, all it said was the story has a beginning and ending.  Nothing else.  I was looking forward to watching the whole history of the Von Erichs.  I was a huge fan back in the 1980's.  The way it was described on Amazon, sounded as if there were some of their old matches.  I would like to send this dvd back and get a refund for the $7.94. But if you have a better dvd with all the matches and their history an exchange would be better.  Please let me know either way.  Thank you for your consideration in  this matter.

Sincerely,

Maria Nolan",1382400000,4,920,4.171428571428572
8476664,5,B005K8RJPQ,I was in my early teens when i would go with friends or family every Friday night to the sportatorium and watched my heroes wrestle ! Nothing has excited me like those nights in that hot smoke filled arena ! Ive seen this dvd before and am ordering now ! Losing that precious family is like losing a part of us who were living thru them !,1357603200,3,338,4.059701492537314
8476665,5,B005K8RJPQ,The movie arrived before I expected and was in excellent quality! Thank you for the prompt service! I haven't been able to find this particular movie for suce a low price that wasn't scratched and unable to view...and this one was brand new. I am very pleased I chose to deal with you.,1348704000,,285,4.39622641509434
8476666,5,B005K8RJPQ,"I gave this dvd a high rating because I also Gave Heros of world class a high rating. This Dvd is almost the exact same as Heros of world class. The only difference is they use a few more photos and extended videos. They also changed some of the music.

Some posters would like you to believe this isn't the same, but it is. If you own Heros then I wouldnt waste your money on this one.",1325548800,10,386,4.012987012987013
8476667,5,B005K8RJPQ,"This is a great story, and a real must for wrestling fans.

I also have the older release and this footage is not the ""exact same"" footage in a different package as others would lead you to believe.

If you are a real wrestling fan, you will enjoy this incredible story.

I watched them both side by side and this is a great version of a great story.  Very well done considering the circumstances. Praise goes out to the producer Brian Harrison.

It should also be noted,

This great documentary was done long before the WWE purchased the rights to the World Class Wrestling footage and furthermore, has no connection to the WWE as stated in an earlier review.

The fact is, this is a wonder and compelling story told in the best possible way by
a producer who cared about the Von Erich Family and wanted to tell the real story
behind the rise and fall, of World Class Championship Wrestling and the family who started it all.

Great! and I give it Five Stars.",1321315200,2,960,4.4147727272727275
8476668,1,B005K8RJPQ,"For those of you who purchased the independently-released ""Heroes of World Class"" DVD a few years ago, don't bother picking this up as it is the exact same thing (albeit with different packaging)!! Nothing new to see here, folks!

With the WWE owning the World Class Championship Wrestling tape library, it should have come as no suprise that this was nothing more than a
rehash of a disc that has already been released twice before.

For shame!

Let my blunder be a lesson to the discerning buyer.

Oh, well.  Time to test out Amazon's return policy...",1320796800,27,553,4.71875
