8590192,1,B00D75TZ4W,This game came in a ripped up crumpled cellophane package and the bingo sheets are TINY(about the size of a greeting card)!!! AND THERE ARE ONLY 4 BINGO SHEETS... The calling cards are perforated and you have to tear them apart on your own. THIS IS BY FAR THE CHINCIEST Lotoria game I have ever seen.,1450742400,2,300,4.375

8590194,1,B00D75TZ4W,worst purchase ever the disk was scratched,1423353600,,42,5.142857142857143
8590195,5,B00D75TZ4W,"to be honest I bought this for someone else but when I watched it, I ordered another one for me to watch, because it was so funny.  it is packed with, I believe, 15 episodes which are insanely hilarious",1418688000,,202,4.17948717948718
8590196,3,B00D75TZ4W,This was not a great party disc.  It had all the downer episodes but it's my own fault for not paying closer attention to the title.  I do love all Finn & Jake episodes but having all these sad ones in one disc did not make for feel good times.,1410739200,,244,3.86
8590197,4,B00D75TZ4W,"Kinda sucks I saw almost all these episodes before, but I love having each disc that comes out.
Everything I expected, since it's actually not a season.
Good purchase though!",1390003200,,174,4.833333333333333
8590198,1,B00D75TZ4W,Don't waste your money and purchase this version from Amazon - go to anywhere else.  This is the only one that doens't come with the hat which completely crushed my kids.  Every other site comes with a hat and is a better deal.  Even more disappointing since all of the advertising shows the DVD coming with a hat.  Future business on these will be going to Barnes and Noble since they are honest about what's in the box.,1381795200,7,421,4.358974358974359
