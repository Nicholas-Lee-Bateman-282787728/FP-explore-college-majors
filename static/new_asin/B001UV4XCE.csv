3809676,4,B001UV4XCE,"This is a rough-and-tumble film that shows us the personalities of the young men who rise to social and media prominence in a national sport. It shows us the guys behind the flat, cliche-ridden delivery of on-the-field interviews for TV sports and the glamorizing of sports writers and commentators. The film's two central characters are country bumpkins, who happen to be so naturally gifted as athletes that they shoot straight to the top of the game and are soon rolling in dough and luxuries, unaware of the under-the-table wheeling and dealing of their manager and owners.

Brothers - one of them married, one not - compete as much with each other as any team they play against. Given opportunities to learn about the way of the world, they miss every one of them, fixated on what they are really interested in - a singing career for one and high-stakes gambling for the other. It's a recipe for an unhappy ending, but even when matters take a turn for the worse, there are no regrets. There's plenty of cleverness in this film that celebrates sport while satirizing the conventional sports movie. The spectacular plays on the field are off camera, and we get instead the amazed reaction shots of onlookers.

Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna are well matched as the film's two brothers, nicknamed Rudo and Cursi. Bernal has the wonderful ability to play farcical comedy as naturally as he does straight dramatic roles. This film is not the social commentary that we get in the excellent road movie ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" which under its comic surface is dead serious. ""Rudo y Cursi"" is more of a lark and for all that probably less memorable.",1252022400,3,1646,4.751748251748252
3809677,4,B001UV4XCE,"I saw ""Rudo y Cursi"" this year at the Sarasota Film Festival and was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the movie. The main reason I went to see ""Rudo y Cursi"" was because it starred Gael Garcia Bernal, whose films I generally enjoy. I felt a little unsure about the film going into it, because I didn't know much going into the film and felt this would be a typical sports movie, but I really enjoyed seeing this. The film is truly a story of two brothers more than anything, and, though it does revolve around their passion for sports, it didn't feel like your regular sports film. It does have some of your stereotypical sports film moments, but in the end it was a very unique movie experience. Anyone who enjoys Gael Garcia Bernal films, will definitely love this movie. He is equally serious and humorous in the film and serves as a great counterpart to Diego Luna who plays his brother. I feel that this film can be enjoyed by a wide array of viewers and would suggest this film to anyone, as it is an all around great movie.",1250035200,8,1038,4.355670103092783

3809679,4,B001UV4XCE,"Like any good sports movie, the subtitled ""Rudo y Cursi"" is not at all about sports. The competition exists on a much more fundamental level: One brother is pitted against the other in a battle over who the better person is. Even more fundamental is the battle each brother wages with himself between his talent and his passion, neither of which seem to go hand in hand. The strength of this film is that it relies on these simple, understandable ideas to get its point across. It also relies on clearly defined characters that behave realistically. The brothers, for example, seem not like archetypal clones but rather like actual human beings, shifting back and forth between loving and hating each other. While none of this makes for groundbreaking cinema, it does allow for an enjoyable film that's sometimes fun, sometimes dramatic, and always charming.

The film, written and directed by Carlos Cuarn (Alfonso's brother), is about Tato (Gael Garca Bernal) and Beto (Diego Luna), brothers from a rural Mexican village where life revolves around a banana plantation. As they play soccer, they're spotted by a stranded talent scout named Batuta (Guillermo Francella), who doubles as the film's narrator. As smooth as can be, he offers them a chance to try out for a professional team. From this, we get a much better understanding of who the brothers are: Tato clearly has talent on the field, but his real dream is to be a famous singer; Beto's dream is to be a goalie, although he seems better suited for a career in gambling. Both seem determined to help their mother, who's married to a new husband neither one of them have any patience for.

It's the eager and ignorant Tato who Batuta chooses first, and within no time, he's taken to Mexico City and given the nickname ""Cursi"" (which translates as ""vulgar""). The quick-tempered Beto eventually joins his brother, leaving behind a wife, a few children, and a steady job. He earns the nickname ""Rudo"" (which translates as ""coarse"").

As they both go through the ups and downs of playing on a professional soccer team--and this definitely includes the many hazing rituals in the locker room showers--they engage in other activities. Tato begins dating a beautiful TV personality and produces a music video for the Spanish version of ""I Want You to Love Me."" Beto gets sidetracked by fame and fortune, resulting in risky games of high stakes poker and a line or two of cocaine. It also results in a considerable amount of debt ... the kind that comes with death threats from shady people. This isn't good, especially since his wife has made the journey to Mexico City hoping to make it big pitching health supplements.

All this inevitably leads to a climactic soccer match, made more interesting by the fact that Tato and Beto find themselves on opposite teams. Were this all ""Rudo y Cursi"" were concerned with, it would be a very mundane film. As it is, it's an absorbing tale of two conflicting personalities, both so convincing that they effectively overshadow the conventional plot. One of my favorite scenes takes place on the beach, where the brothers are spending time with their visiting mother. As they sit in the sand, each son tries to one-up the other by promising to build a big house right along the shore. It's a perfect example of evoking a rivalry, and I say ""evoking"" because one gets the sense that it's been building within them ever since they were children.

This very intentionally functions as a counterpart to Batuta's narration, which seems made up almost entirely of proverbs and facts. He begins the film, for instance, by giving us a brief history of soccer: Long, long ago, the Ancient Aztecs invented a game in which they kicked around the severed head of their enemies. We know right then and there that ""Rudo y Cursi"" will be a story of competition and sacrifice with just a little bit of game-playing thrown in for good measure. To extend the metaphor, the story that we're about to see will be just like a soccer match, with opposing forces working towards their own set of goals.

By the end of the film, there's the implication that every gets exactly what they wanted out of life, albeit in unconventional ways. To elaborate would give too much away, but rest assured that the story resolves itself appropriately, if not unexpectedly. What ""Rudo y Cursi"" lacks in originality is more than made up for in depth of character and simplicity of theme; we watch this film aware yet forgiving of its conventions, and that's because we're being told a relatable story with protagonists who seem real. This would have been very difficult to achieve were it not for the natural onscreen chemistry between Bernal and Luna. They just seem like a natural fit together. More to the point, they seemed like actual brothers--perpetually caught in that gray zone between love and hate, driven by the need to upstage each other, united in their desire to please their mother. This, I feel, is so much more compelling than a simple game of soccer.",1242777600,14,5023,4.801156069364162

3810056,4,B001UV4XCE,"The film Rudo y Cursi is one that will appeal to sports enthusiasts across the spectrum and is not just limited to fans of the beautiful game that is football because it is about more than just the sport.
  If you are someone such as myself who has conversations related to the world of sport on a regular basis, it is most likely you have been a part of a discussion that seeks to answer. How could they be so dumb with money?
 In director Carlos Cuarns debut, he shines a light onto just how athletes can have trouble adapting to their new lifestyles brought on by the talent. Although, the film places an specific emphasis on the state of Mexico Citys narco-society, its satire is one that can apply to athletes in regions all over the world who come from humble beginnings and are thrust into a life they are not accustomed to.
 Rudo y Cursi also depicts the role that media has in influencing peoples perceptions of what it means to make it in society.  This is evident early on in the film when Rudo is seen watching television with his wife and sees a brand new vehicle that he hopes to one day purchase for his mother.
 Rudo y Cursi is a must-watch for sports fanatics who would like to gain a better understanding to the some of the struggles that athletes face that aren't covered by the cameras at game-time.",1428019200,,1319,4.385245901639344

3810205,4,B001UV4XCE,"Rudi Y Cursi is a great film that proves that Mexican Cinema still has some bite.  Of course it helps that the film does have some incredible lead actors (Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna).  Be warned that the movie is in Spanish and that the subtitles do not do the actors justice.  The story is pretty good but not as great as Y Tu Mama Tambien, however the great thing about watching these two actors work together is the dynamic interchange between the two.  Whenever they are on screen together, the relationships (in whatever movie) are so believable.  If they play brothers (as in this film) or friends (Y Tu Mama Tambien), the true essence of natural acting shines through.  What I enjoyed about this movie as well as in Y Tu Mama Tambien, is the way the film gave a wide range in terms of the variety of true Mexican culture and society.  The story itself ranges from humble to over the top, tragic at times and hilarious at others.

3810209,3,B001UV4XCE,"How do you make a sports-themed movie with virtually no sports action in it? Call Guillermo del Toro, I guess. The comedic elements are just laughable. The one brother as a singer doing a Spanish ranchera version of a Cheap Trick song just made me think, ""Is '70s rock still alive for Mexicans in 2009?""

This is an identikit by-the-numbers telenovela story really. Two poor brothers make it big in the world of soccer and end up (SPOILER ALERT) in the ""pen[alty]ultimate faceoff.

The acting is first-rate although Gabriel Garcia Bernal is looking too much like Freddie Prinze. Jr., in this flick for my liking which drove me to distraction. The soccer scenes, albeit brief, are good especially of the training ground and the final match complete with the ever ""classy"" vocal rendering of Mexican soccer crowds. Problem is we rarely get to see either brother show off their soccer skills. Then again this is more a movie about sibling rivalry and love than anything else.

That's where this movie falls flat. The script is brutal. What do the boys do when they go to the big time in Mexico City--one falls into drugs and gambling and the other hooks up with a hottie who dumps him the minute he stops scoring the big goals. It reads like a very bad romance novel.

The last half hour on the soccer pitch more than makes up for the ""you see it coming from a mile away"" plot up till then.

The weird thing is why did they decide a penalty kick would be the most dramatic event to drive the movie from start to finish. When Rudo the keeper comes up with the suggestion of one penalty kick to decide whether the scout Baton will take him or his brother, Cursi, is the guy insane? Face facts, 90 percent of the time the penalty taker will score. Why not challenge him to something with a bit of a 50/50 chance of success?

I guess it's all in there to set us up for the final scene but still I thought it proved how dumb Rudo was at gambling and maybe that was the point. I don't know but that got this movie off to a stupid start really.

The extras are decent with the usual making of, deleted scenes, commentary track but the bonus is a classic in theater ""turn off your cell phones"" clip with the stars of the pic.",1328832000,,2214,4.385365853658537
3810210,4,B001UV4XCE,"This is a sort of follow on to `Y Tu Mama Tambien' as it brings together the same team from that movie. It stars Diego Luna as Beto and his half brother Tato being played by Gael Garcia Bernal. They work on a banana plantation and struggle to make a decent living - dreaming of the day that  they can fulfil the promise they made to their mum and actually build her the house she has always wanted.

Then while they are playing a game of football, a wandering talent scout has the misfortune to get a puncture in their town. He watches the match whilst drinking cold beer and awaiting the repair. He then says they are both good enough to play at club level, but he will only take one. They decide which with a penalty shoot out -as one is striker and the other a goalie.
Tato wins and its off to Mexico city, where he gets to meet the rich and famous and indulge his real passion of singing - badly. He pesters Baton the coach into finding a place for his brother and he manages to get him one.

The story is about love, envy, greed, pride and the sudden realisation that the higher you get, the further you have to fall. There are some really great moral lessons in here all tied up with buckets of humour and real affection. It is a warm story told well, acted superbly and brilliantly written and directed by Carlos Cuaron. At ninety seven minutes it will be over leaving you wanting more, in Spanish (Mexican) with great sub titles, this was one of those films I had been meaning to se for a while and now can not belive I was missing pout for so long - can not recommend highly enough.",1313366400,,1591,4.2098360655737705

Garcia Bernal and Luna do great character acting, and the interaction between the Mexican brothers and their Argentine manager is funny and spot-on.

3810310,4,B001UV4XCE,"'Rudo y Cursi' is a fun, rollicking movie and a cautionary tale to boot.  I was lucky enough to see this film's debut at Dallas AFI in early 2009, where it was introduced by writer/director Carlos Cuarn.  That night, Cuarn called 'Rudo y Cursi' ""a tale of my Mexico and what it is today, good or bad.""  What we get is Cuarn's comedic/dramatic arc of the gravitational pull of Mexico D.F. on small-city dreamers, an obsession with El Ftbol Mexicano, shady sports promotion, a hyper-aggressive media looking to find and promote stars, here-today-gone-tomorrow success, and - lurking in the background - allusions to the ascendancy of powerful drug lords.

Our audience was split 50-50 between native Spanish and English speakers - the Spanish-speaking half laughed uproariously throughout; the English-speaking half found the proceedings interesting, funny...but maybe not quite that funny.  The difference was between the spoken word and the subtitles - I had a friend confirm that half-brothers Tato (Gael Garca Bernal) and Beto (Diego Luna) are insulting each other throughout in inventive, bluer-than-blue, can-you-top-this street language.  The subtitles reflect only a small slice of that linguistic flair.

Like many, I was delighted by the little Easter egg tucked away inside this film: Garca Bernal's hilariously campy ranchera rendition of Cheap Trick's ""I Want You to Want Me"" - recast here as ""Quiero Que Me Quieras."" As director, Carlos Cuarn may not have quite the emotional touch that older brother Alfonso laid down with perfection in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Y-Tu-Mama-Tambien/dp/B00005JL57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>, but Carlos definitely has the ear for comedy and cultural touchstones.

As much fun as it was to watch Garca Bernal and Luna pair up again, my favorite role in the film belonged to Argentine actor Guillermo Francella as sports agent and scout, 'Batuta.'  His role in plucking Tato and Beto from obscurity and riding their wave of success - and what follows - rings true at every step.  He inhabits that role perfectly.",1258070400,5,2125,5.49079754601227
3810311,4,B001UV4XCE,"""Rudo y Cursi"" (2009) features two banana-picking brothers playing football (soccer) in their small Mexican village where they are discovered by a scout/scam artist (Guillermo Francella), the film's sometime narrator. Rudo (Diego Luna) is a goalie, and Cursi (Gael Garcia Bernal) is an effective scorer. The scout can only take one of them to Mexico City, so they choose who is to go by a penalty kick. Cursi wins, gets established in pro soccer, and talks the scout into getting his brother onto another team.
 Both become successful. Cursi would just as soon be a pop music star and tries his hand at it. His flaw is falling for a beautiful faithless celebrity girl friend, and Rudo's failing is his addictive gambling habit.
 Both run into trouble and can't handle success. There are a lot of crooks around ready to fix games, and one brother gets entrapped in a fix which involves the other.
 The movie ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" was co-written by Carlos Cuaron, but this time he wrote and directed using the same lead actors from ""Mama.""
 In Spanish with English sub-titles, the flick never really shows the two with any real soccer skills, and is short on detailed soccer sequences. The pictures of village life are well-handled, and the movie has many realistic elements.
 These two guys aren't the best actors you've ever seen, but they turn in credible enough jobs to keep the plot boiling and the lid ready to pop. Some of the plot features may seem familiar and overworked to you. It reminds me of what a very good ""B"" movie used to be like in the good old days.",1257638400,5,1566,4.659420289855072

Now once again the three men, along with important input from some of the finest talent in Mexico, join in a low key, warmly humorous, well acted and directed and produced RUDO y CURSI. There has been considerable publicity about the movement to raise the importance of Mexican films to the high standards of International films, largely due to the passion of Garc&iacute;a Bernal, Luna, Cuar&oacute;n, Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Guillermo del Toro.  The success of this movement is obvious in this very fine film - a tightly conceived story about the poor families in Mexico who long for the ability to climb the ladder to success in business, fame and comfort, and the Cinderella story recasting  brothers played by Garc&iacute;a Bernal and Luna whose struggle for opportunity leads them into the bumpy relationship with a 'talent scout' (Batuta played with aplomb by the Argentinean actor Guillermo Francella) and to tenuous triumph because of their soccer talent and the inevitable temptations of success in the great Mexico City world.

Garc&iacute;a Bernal is Tato (to be nicknamed 'Cursi' by his teammates), a wannabe singer whose goal is to make it big in the world of entertainment, using Batuta as his means to get there. Luna is his brother Beto (to be nicknamed 'Rudo' - the alternate title of the film is 'ROUGH AND VULGAR' instead of 'RUDO y CURSI'!) who is married but longs to follow his brother into the fame of the Big League soccer.  Each lad lands in Mexico City, each takes advantage of his given soccer talent  and each succumbs to personal goals - Rudo to gambling  and Cursi to women and singing in silly music videos.  Batuto is always on the sidelines (and in the voice over narration) to follow each of  brother's successes and failures.  The manner in which the two brothers compete and come together creates a moving and tender story ending.

What makes this little film so special is the genuine qualities and ensemble acting that come from Garc&iacute;a Bernal and Luna but also form the actors portraying the impoverished but proud family of the two boys and the 'big town characters' they encounter in Mexico City.  The film  feels real and committed, mixing just the right amount of humor, fantasy, and tenderness - thanks to the excellent script by writer/director Carlos Cuar&oacute;n. It is a pleasure to watch and a very fine statement about the quality of films coming from Mexico.  Grady Harp, September 09",1252195200,3,2637,5.046082949308755

8345158,5,B001UV4XCE,"I've seen it several times before and even bought the DVD with bonus material (which I'd like to get on Firestick!). A laugh-out-loud comedy with a serious message. It was the first film I saw with Diego Luna. He was portrayed as unattractive, and it took viewing several more of his movies to discover otherwise. I would see Gael Garcia Bernal in anything. He is always gorgeous, intelligent, and has a flair for the comic as well.",1522972800,,432,4.623376623376624

One of my favorite Mexican films. Light up a fatty if you're old school like me or dab it like these youngsters and enjoy this movie!",1518048000,,353,4.67741935483871
