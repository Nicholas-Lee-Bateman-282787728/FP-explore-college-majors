2551469,5,B000F4RHC0,"This film is a three-part BBC special based on Vita Sackville-West's tale of the state of femininity in post-Victorian England.

We open with the death of Lady Slane's (Hiller) husband, a former viceroy of India. We see more from the aged children than the recent widow.  And what we see of the children isn't pretty.  Most of them are more worried about the money than their Mum, who they deem impractical and very amenable to do what they want with her.

Turns out, she isn't.  Lady Slane decides to take a cottage in the Hampsteads, a home she'd seen thirty years prior that turns out to still be available for rent.

Instead of the society the family expects her to keep, she has tea mostly with the landlord and handyman.  The only family member who visits often is great-granddaughter Deborah (Snowden) who is about to wed a Duke and isn't particularly happy about the situation.

It's fascinating to watch how these two generations of the family evolve and change as they have decisions to make about their lives and futures.  The story's lovely and strongly emotional.  Dame Wendy Hiller is an amazing actress and a beautiful woman herself.

On a personal note, it reminds me of what a treasure it was to have known my own great-grandmother. I miss her every day.

To those of us who especially appreciate that era of history, it was also instsructive.  I am sure I will view it another 6 times!",1215216000,14,251,4.976190476190476
2551471,5,B000F4RHC0,"Wendy Hiller and Harry Andrews deliver haunting and very, very beautiful performances in this, one of the best films I have ever seen. It is all--every bit of it--utterly charming, provocative, true, beautiful, and brimming with life in every scene.

And the reviews that speak of Vita's feminism, though true, miss entirely the point that this film is as completely relevant socially, emotionally, and spiritually now as it was in Vita's 1930's.

The film is not glitzy, or fast, or loud, but it is one of my few all-time favorite films. Like the rest of them, it seeps into one's soul like wine falling slowing through water, eventually coloring one's whole view of life. You will not be quite the same once you have given yourself the gift of All Passion Spent.",1190073600,127,764,4.78030303030303

The fabulous Wendy Hiller portrays a strong-minded elderly Lady in this excellent TV mini-series, breaking the stereotype and showing that seniors have aspirations of their own like any other age groups.

2551486,5,B000F4RHC0,"I can't even tell you how much I love this story. It is divided into three episodes. I love that it is a story of personalities and how people are. The mother is the main character and she has lived as others wanted her to her whole life. Once her husband, whom she loved dearly passes away, she is finally free to be the woman she wants. It shows how her children really did not know her except for two that were just like her and so they shared a kinship with her, while the others underestimated her and considered her irrational or not capable. I love the contradictions they are faced with in her behavior and how she is completely UN-oppologetic about her choices. Inspiring and touching. The people who become her close friends are so amazing.  Its absolutely a beautiful story.",1387324800,2,785,4.489510489510489
2551487,5,B000F4RHC0,I love this movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and the persons chosen to represent each.  A really nice production.

2551498,5,B000F4RHC0,"This is a piece of group theater using an excellent cast of players. The story is interesting, and inspired me to read Vita Sackville-West. The plot centers around a woman in her later years finally taking back her life. While she has some regrets regarding the sacrifices she made for husband and family, for the most part she's ready to make her own choices, unimpeded by those around her. Inspiring, with delightful performances.",1381536000,2,432,4.931506849315069

2551501,2,B000F4RHC0,"All the great reviews here, I expected a wonderful movie.  Well, if you like to watch frumpy old men babbling away in unintelligable upperclass English about their lives and the appropriate steps for a recently widowed older woman, then this movie is your thing.  The subject might have been an interesting one, but this draggy candidate for insomnia misses the mark.  Ugh!  Well, I finally watched the 3rd and last episode.  Gosh, this drama is depressing!  First two episodes are draggy and boring, as mentioned, and the last is a real downer.  Need a lift in your life??  Uh, don't buy this!",1370736000,,594,4.754901960784314
2551502,5,B000F4RHC0,"Watching our heroine gently and strongly do what she thought was right for her after her husband dies made this movie a delight.
Her children's plans for her did not correspond to her plans for the rest of her life. Love the hidden messages of what she thinks is important---giving her jewels to only one sondaughter-in-law.  Wondering why?  I have all ready watched this movie 2 times and will watch it often. Have recommended it to many people and had a tea party to view it with a friend. The script is so well written and there are lines that I will want to repeat in my conversations.  This is a fun watch for any of the older generation facing decisions in the later years and doing it with delight and freedom.",1366502400,3,717,4.416666666666667

2551506,5,B000F4RHC0,"This movie was excellent. The story was beautiful and touching. The acting and actors were superb! There could not have been better actors to play in this movie. Dame Wendy Hiller was excellent in this movie, this truly is a classical story in Edwardian England, and the author Vita Sackville-West is an outstanding writer.

2551520,5,B000F4RHC0,"I can watch this over and over again.  This short story is wonderful and a great picture of life after 60.

Wonderful and captivating and a charmer.",1347148800,,310,4.5
2551521,4,B000F4RHC0,"The story is very slow. Nothing is wrong with that, except you need to be ready. This story is for a easy, slow evening. I liked the way th main lady maneuveres her childern, who think they are running things. Ms. Hillery is a very good actress. Her relationship with people should be a lesson for all of us. It's a clean story. No violence, hard laugange or nudity. It has to do with honor, respect, being in control of ones self.",1339977600,4,431,4.2682926829268295
2551522,5,B000F4RHC0,"Our 85-year-old heroine is much stronger than she appears. It's a joy to see her teach her family a thing or two about what's important in life.

When 85-year-old Lady Slane, played by Dame Wendy Hiller, is widowed, her children immediately make her plans for her. Fortunately for her and for us, she has other plans.  Exhibiting great poise and grace, she carries out her own plans to move to a small cottage where she meets and entertains new friends who are surprisingly different from what her position in life and her family deem appropriate.  It is a pleasure to watch",1337299200,2,574,4.663366336633663
2551523,5,B000F4RHC0,"Dame Wendy Hiller is superb in this portrait of a woman transitioning from Victorian values to the new freedoms that women are gaining in the post-Victorian age. After the death of her husband, she asserts some of these freedoms to the surprise of her children and discovers that there is a life to be had in her twilight years. What a wonderful story.",1330387200,,352,4.603174603174603
2551524,5,B000F4RHC0,"I had never read anything by Vita Sackville-West so ""All Passion Spent"" was a pleasant surprise. The characters are as vivid and memorable as anything Dickens wrote. I'm not quite as old as the main character but I get courage from her refusal to obey her children and her determination to live out her widowhood the way she wants. She's gentle and loving and insistent on having her way in this. Listen for the reference to the lilies of the field at the end. I've watched this a dozen times and still choke up. Not because it's a Biblical reference, but because it's so apt.",1327622400,3,576,4.495238095238095
2551525,1,B000F4RHC0,"As a dedicated devotee of British drama, it pains me greatly to have to say this but, try as I will, I found this  boring beyond my ability to appreciate it. It is a finely done production by every measure: superb acting etc. but it simply touches nothing for me. I cannot imagine anyone younger than 65 getting past the first ten minutes. {I am 73 so perhaps a few more years will ripen me up for it.}  The concept is hackneyed -- Sackville-West, it seems, is conveying a story about an old broad who, at 85, is at last going to release her pent-up feelings about female suppression and cut loose out there in Hampstead as a newly minted widow whose children look almost as old as she. {That is part of the problem  re dramatic credibility.} She awaits with modest but nonetheless unabashed joy and sly caution  the prospect of now sharing with great-granddaughter the myriad of profound insights that were most surely  formulating as she dutifully lay in the marriage bed during those  miserable years of marriage with a man of such distinction that, upon his death, no one can decide where to bury him. {Finally, Westminster Abbey becomes the spot of choice topped off with a note of condolence from the Queen herself} Great granddaughter, of course, is already privy to all of this re the significant fact that a woman's place most certainly is not to be at the husband's side but rather doing one's own thing in compliance with whatever this prudish young woman's idea of that might be. So off they go, bonding along while the audience falls flat on its collective arse in deep slumber. I fear that I fell prey to making  this most hasty, uninformed, and unfortunate selection by an absolute blind devotion to  Downton Abbey. I should know better. In any event, I am completely aware of what an uncritical review this is. Thus I will depart. Just don't say I didn't warn you!!",1327276800,14,1881,4.594029850746269
2551526,3,B000F4RHC0,"As always, buying from AMAZON is great.  The movie was a little disappointing, It is slow moving, but the title tells all.",1318032000,,122,4.545454545454546
2551527,5,B000F4RHC0,"A very nice movie but not quite the ultimate feminist manifesto. After all, Lady Slane is, first of all, ""Lady"" because of the position held by her deceased husband. Second, while the film insists that she is not nearly as wealthy as she should be and would be if Britain paid its public officials more generously, she has a sufficiency to rent a house in Hampstead with an acre of land, to fix the house up beautifully (it is in desperate disrepair), to afford a full-time personal maid, &c. While the life thus available to her may not be what her (mostly awful) children think she should have, most of us would not feel terribly disadvantaged to have it. In other words, one must be rather well disposed to the British aristocracy not to think occasionally, during this movie, about the Declaration of Independence.

That being said, the film is beautifully done. I have adored Wendy Hiller since her early days (1930s) playing George Bernard Shaw heroines, most memorably Major Barbara. You had better agree, for the cameraman is totally in love with her, and if she were any less charming, the entire show would fall apart. But her charm is limitless and so the focus on her every expression is welcome. All the other parts, both the fine fellows and the spoiled brats, are well done; the great granddaughter is as charming as her ancestor. The scenes are lovely. Many years ago I lived in London and recognize the architecture and even more the gardens - we had a lovely garden, albeit one we shared with our neighbors (neighbours). The film, a mini series, is spread over 3 episodes each lasting a bit under an hour, ideal for watching at dinner time over 3 days, which is what we did with great pleasure. It certainly was a welcome change from the clangor of the political/economic news. I do recommend it highly.",1312502400,10,1821,4.65527950310559
2551538,5,B000F4RHC0,"Our whole family adores this video. We have watched it more than a dozen times and still see new gems in it. A telling phrase, an expression on one of the excellent actors' faces or some new reminder of how we need to learn to grow old with dignity. Lady Slane certainly is an inspiration to us in this regard. Has there ever been such fine acting in a film that so few people know exists? Enjoy!",1309910400,,396,4.1558441558441555
2551539,5,B000F4RHC0,"This was an excellent film which deserves the highest rating possible. It should become a classic. The acting, period settings and plot were well developed, understandable, and flowed in a very smooth fashion. My only regret was that the film ended and I was anxious for the story to continue. I hope there is some sort of follow up. Watching the film sparked an interest in Vita Sackville-West, the period, and her family. It was a wonderful social history of the period and the story could have gone in any direction. Each of the characters in the film was a story in itself. I was lucky to have found this. One note, there are three segments on the disc and no continuous play option.",1307232000,3,687,4.548387096774194

Master piece Theatre; an apt description. BBC production.

Everything about this production is magnificent; the acting was superb.
A glimpse into the days' when women supported their husband's occupation full time, putting aside most of their needs with the exception of childbearing. No recrimminations, that is just how it was.

This one definitely ranks up there with the best. The story is gently acerbic and the character development is truly fine. Wendy Hiller gives a terrific performance, portraying the dowager with a light but very firm hand on the helm of her life. once her public/familial duty is done, her duty is to herself, despite the arrogance and assumptions of her children and their spouses.

2551542,5,B000F4RHC0,"A lady of class shows family and friends what class really means. She is a ""Victorian-style"" widow who surprises her family with gumption and a mind of her own. At age 85, Lady Slane (Dame Wendy Hiller-`Anne of Avonlea') becomes like a woman of the 21st century and makes her own decisions, a step ahead of her greedy heirs, and to the delight of the viewer. She downsizes, gives away much of what others think important, and moves to Hampstead Heath, a place to rest, a place with peach trees, and refuses visitors under age 40. One exception is a great-granddaughter, Deborah (Jane Snowden-amazing also in `Wish Me Luck') who L. Slane sees as similar to herself as a young girl.

The cast makes this Masterpiece Theatre, BBC, Vita (Victoria Mary) Sackville-West adaptation a success.
Mr. Fitzgeorge (Harry Andrews-`S.O.S. Titanic' 'Agony & the Ecstasy') was a past relationship with the Lady, and reminds her of much, but only after her husband's death. Son Herbert (Graham Crowden-`The Way We Live Now' `Bleak House' `Waiting for God') and his wife Mabel (Antonia Pemberton-`Enemy at the Door' `Behaving Badly') lead the greed of offspring. Son, Kay (John Franklyn-Robbins-`Emma' `I, Claudius') and daughter/spinster Edith (Hilary Mason-`Nicholas Nickleby' `Maid Marion and Her Merry Men') seem the best of the children. Daughter Carrie played by Phyllis Calvert (`Mrs Dalloway' `Kate' `Little Women'). Son William (Geoffrey Bayldon-`Hallelujah!' `To Sir With Love') and wife Lavinia (Faith Brook-`The Irish R.M.' `War and Peace') also scheme to get all and everything they can of value. They all miss the point and fail to see what their mother hold of true value.

How much freedom do duty and love permit any person? The writing is wonderful, the staging unfussy and utterly convincing, and the cast - led by the superb Wendy Hiller - completely winning. This three-part adaptation of the Vita Sackville-West novel, made in 1986, looks and sounds as fresh as new paint and is a treasurable addition to any collection.",1289952000,18,515,5.216867469879518
2551545,5,B000F4RHC0,"Lady Slane (Wendy Hiller) spent all her life being an et ux. She enjoyed being the wife of the viceroy, a mother, and a leader of charities. However when her husband died she finally, against her children's wishes, had time to contemplate her life, what it could have been and what it will be.

She moves into a smaller house that she had seen 30 years before. Now she strikes up a friend ship with people as the house owner, the craftsman repairing the house and others.

Unknown to her is a friend of one of her sons, who knew her 60 years ago in India.  He reliving the time and she realizing that they both had great depth that was not required of them at the time, form a unique friendship.

We get the privilege of watching Lady Slane make her discoveries and the reaction to this by the family.  Of particular interest is her great grand daughter is now on the cusp of making the same life choice that Lady Slane succumbed to.

Based on the novel by Vita Sackville-West, ""All Passion Spent"" we see a lot of Vita's real life parallels. The screen adaptation is by Peter Buckman. This film has that BBC quality.",1249430400,,1116,4.367149758454106

Viewing it in conjunction with ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" might be interesting (perhaps with ""The Wrong Box"" as well).
The depiction of the greed of one's potential heirs rings all too true but  overbalances the script for this reviewer's taste.

8117452,5,B000F4RHC0,An exceptionally wonderful film with a most informative emotional story- line for elderly in copping with the loss of of a spouse. Wendy Hiller carries off this most difficult role as only she can. All developmental ages have much to learn if they let the story engage their emotions. For it ca[tures ever so accurately how this final act plays out in a family releasing emotions that linger from childhood. Very strong emotional treatment. Undoubtedly one of the strongest films of this genra. A must see film one of the five best. Maurice James  . .,1421107200,,551,4.739583333333333
