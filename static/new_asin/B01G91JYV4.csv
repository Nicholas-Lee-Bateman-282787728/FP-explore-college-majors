7759076,5,B01G91JYV4,Excellent work by Kyle T. Miller. I thoroughly enjoyed the plot and more importantly the characters were believable. Newcomer Niya Davis is a force to be reckoned with. I will be looking for more from this director and from all of the actors!,1472515200,,242,4.651162790697675

7759086,1,B01G91JYV4,"Sorry, I struggled through to complete this movie, however I wasn't impressed. This is the first review I've written that strongly urges others they can watch it, but in my opinion the acting was pretty poor, most predicaments some got into were so obvious and predictable. Some of the actors were sobbing but they've were no tears. Whoever wrote the screenplay, made a nice attempt to write about a womanizer, but the actor protraying the part needs to continue to learn his craft. This movie for me fell short ........kind of disappointing.",1478476800,,542,4.9021739130434785

7759092,5,B01G91JYV4,"I think the movie is a great inspiration to love in this real life we live in.  You never know what could happen. It's a low budget film but well worth watching.  You go through so many emotions and you are left guessing the outcome.  Hats off to Kyle Miller and crew, actors and to the plot of the story.  I will be watching for more",1476316800,,334,4.015151515151516
7759093,5,B01G91JYV4,Really out standing meaning loved it.,1475971200,,37,5.333333333333333
7759094,5,B01G91JYV4,"By no means was it the greatest movie ever done but I didn't expect that. What I did want was a story where the actors wanted to be a part of the story, completely and not merely reciting words in front of a camera I wanted them to feel inspired by what they were doing and the message they were looking to express was truly conveyed. This movie told a story very common in society today, and one that I can truly relate to. Love indeed does conquer all and no matter what, when God says its right its right.

I personally loved the movie. I felt inspired and immediately called friends to tell them to watch it. So many good points, so many moments that sparked emotions. Thank you all for putting this movie together. THANK YOU

My hat off to you all",1475884800,3,752,4.215277777777778

7759097,5,B01G91JYV4,"I loved the play Ashley & Jeremy, on which the movie is based. knowing how movies made from books or plays don't always get the small nuisances across on the big screen, I didn't have high expectations, but I loved every minute of it. This is only the beginning from new director Kyle Miller.",1472860800,,292,4.425925925925926
8762574,3,B01G91JYV4,"Good acting. But too long, too predictable, too common of a story. Upsetting moments no tears.",1537056000,,94,4.9375

8762579,4,B01G91JYV4,Started off not liking this movie only to stick with and ending up loving it. Relatable love story with religious overtones that are subtle but true.  Great cast with a non predictable storyline.,1484438400,,195,4.909090909090909
