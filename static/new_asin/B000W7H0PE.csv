8221486,4,B000W7H0PE,"I did this DVD a LOT back when it was first released and loved it. Then, I didn't do it for a really long time as I moved on to other DVDs.  I kept it because I felt like I'd want to come back to it one day - and, I'm glad I did.  It's a good workout for me to have because it is different from any other workouts I have.  I may not do it often, but I would miss it if I didn't have it.

The DVD main menu has the following options:

Pre-Exercise Guidelines
The Workout
Cooldown

The workout is comprised of a series of exercises, one after the other, and you do each exercise for 1 minute.  Anni notes when you are at the end of 10, 20, and 30 minutes and gives you the option of skipping to the cooldown.  Unfortunately, the main menu has the only chapter points - you can't skip any individual exercise easily; you have to fast forward through it.

Anni shows the ""standard"" exercise and 2 background exercisers modify it - Amy shows the more advancd modifications, which includes using a step, and Eli shows beginner options. I follow all three of them at one point or another in the workout.

Anni encourages you to carry 1 pound hand weights throughout the workout and gives the option to increase the weight to 3 lbs for strength moves.  I find the strength moves pretty useless since they aren't long enough to really add strength, so I try to add movement with most of them to keep up the cardio effect.

All the exercises are drill based, easy to follow movements with no complex choreography. I think the fanciest they get is a sashay and the Charleston. Easier moves include hamstring curls and step touches.  Some of the moves include impact, but Eli always gives a low-impact modification.  And, you can follow Amy with some moves even if you don't use a step.  Sometimes, I like her more advanced modification and do it without the step.

Personally, I like this DVD.  For me, the first few minutes drag a little with the strength moves I don't enjoy, but I've learned to modify them.  Once I'm past that, the workout picks up and is a lot of fun.",1434326400,,2062,4.2979274611398965
8221487,5,B000W7H0PE,"Love this workout. She really gives you a great cardio workout.

You have 3 levels of intensity, and alternative ways of working out
the same area.

Each exercise is 1 minute and you quickly move onto the next.
You chose your workout from 10 minutes to 20, 30, 40, 50.  She
reminds you every 10 minutes if you want to keep on going or
if you need to increase the level up a notch or decrease it.

You use 1 lb weights and have the option to increase the weights.
You can use a bar for stabilization on some exercises and a mat for
some floor work. Optional stepper to increase the intensity.

You will work every part of your body, doing punches, kicks, squats,
lunges while moving every part of your body.

The music is fantastic, with great beats that make you want to
keep on moving.

She encourages you throughout the whole workout.

Even my husband noticed I started loosing weight, I'm incorporating
this work out with BeyondDiet which I joined through the BeyondDiet
website for about $49 for a lifetime subscription.

Anywho, I loved this workout so much I purchased Anni Mairs':
Core Force and Anni's Force Fitness: Life Force, (title almost the same.)

I really love this work out!",1364428800,,1191,4.549295774647887
8221488,5,B000W7H0PE,"With all the intense/insane/shredding workouts out there, sometimes I feel like there aren't a whole lot of options for those of us who just want a good, solid workout without all the anger and frenetic exercises.  I've found the perfect solution in Anni Mairs' Life Force.

Everything is here--cardio, strength training, and stretching.  In one-minute segments, you will work out all body parts without taking it from the top, having to memorize complicated dance steps, or flailing around and contorting your body in an effort to be cut.  Basic, controlled moves are shown that take minimal learning to get down.  The cardio effect continues during the strength training intervals.  Three levels are shown, so this routine would work well for beginners through advanced, the only exception being super advanced or athletes who would need more of a challenge.  You have the option of working out for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, or doing the whole 50-minute routine (not including the initial 2-minute warm up and the 8-minute cool down/stretch).  If any move doesn't feel right to your body, or you have a different strength training exercise you prefer for that particular body part, you can substitute your own exercise in for that minute without losing the flow of the workout.  I have to do this on a few occasions within the workout due to personal back issues.  The cool down and stretch are, in my opinion, the best in any workout I've done.  The pacing is perfect and the stretches are great for people whose flexibility might not be the best.  The cool down music is a beautiful combination of Gregorian chant/light jazz/Indian pan pipe.  It has a very relaxing, spiritual feel to it, but without putting you to sleep.

I highly recommend this workout for getting all your fitness components done in one package, for the versatility, and as a nice change of pace from the ""killer"" workouts that are out there.",1320624000,,1939,4.9079754601226995
8221489,5,B000W7H0PE,"I'm an intermediate/advanced cardio addict who often ends up with advanced step routines just to get my heart going (often at the expense of my knees).  So I was pleasantly surprised at the intensity of Life Force, and would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a serious workout without serious time spent learning the choreo.

Instead of the standard (Add-on/Build-onto routines), Life Force goes thru a series of very simple 1 minute motions, done at such a fast pace your HR won't drop at the 'toning' intervals. You have your choice of 3 levels of difficulty - all of which (unlike other vids) are EASY to see and follow. So It's extraordinarily easy to adjust your workout for current mood and/or aches and pains... It's also a no-brainer adjusting impact level, and in fact I'd consider this a somewhat Lower impact vid.

Anni's cueing is excellent yet she still finds time to focus your attention to proper form. I personally find this very refreshing compared to the current trend.

Too many of vids (even some of my favorites) require so much time to learn that I'm sick of them by the time I've REALLY got them down pat.
I really DO enjoy good choreography but I also like having some no nonsense vids that really get the job (tone body/burn calories) done in minimum of time and this is surely one of the best in this category.

I think anyone from  intermediate-beginner level thru moderately-advanced level would get much out this vid. TRUE beginners should always start with Fat Burning for Dummies or elsewhere, and VERY advanced exercisers might not find this challenging enough (they should probably do Mair's ""Cardio Force"". available at: [...]
PS: the vid uses 1 pound dumbells (but you could do it without) - and you might prefer to use weighted gloves...",1263513600,3,1781,4.785016286644951
8221490,5,B000W7H0PE,"This little lady, Anni Mairs, makes you work!  Her moves are not complicated, but so very effective.  She incorporates cardio with light weights.  She's one of a group of three and they each show a different level for beginner, intermediate and advanced options.  At times I had to drop my weights to keep my momentum.  This is an excellent workout for all ages.",1227657600,3,362,4.682539682539683
