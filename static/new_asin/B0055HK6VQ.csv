4578342,1,B0055HK6VQ,"This film was definitly aimed at the under 20 crowd.... so unless you like rap and poor acting,don't waste your money. I tried to watch it all the way through to get a better understanding about what the younger crowd was into.... but I couldn't. It drove me nuts. Gonna donate it to the library.",1318636800,5,296,4.4

4578361,5,B0055HK6VQ,My husband and I have watched this movie every year for the past three years and this year I couldn't find where it was being played on ABC Family.

4578363,3,B0055HK6VQ,"This isn't a family film.  More like a teen film.  And the title's misleading.  It's more like A Christmas Carol for teens than a Christmas love story, though it DOES have romance in it.  And the captioning's atrocious which would make it hard for anyone who's hard of hearing or deaf to watch.  Instead of just copying the caption directly from the aired broadcasting, whatever company put the DVD together should've worked to fix it if they were able to.",1449532800,,456,4.65

4578374,1,B0055HK6VQ,"I love cheesy, holiday movies even though they are predictable. Christmas Cupid was horrible!!!  Yes, it was predictable but the characters were not likeable in any respect.  They were all backstabbing and materialistic until the very end. I found nothing remotely heartwarming in the storyline.",1419897600,,295,5.533333333333333
4578375,5,B0055HK6VQ,I loved the film good romance parts its based on A promoter to A film star but who must also loosen up I would however not advise for small children do to the fact there is drinking and other things but it is an excellent movie.,1419638400,,228,3.9782608695652173

4578384,5,B0055HK6VQ,"First of all I really enjoyed this movie and have re-watched it several times this year. It is a different spin on A Christmas Carol and a great romantic movie. However, I don't know if I would say it is a ""family"" movie. It does involve drinking and an out of control pop-star. Personally, I would let my teenage kids watch it as they understand the difference between make-believe movies and real life (real-life pop stars act much worse than this movie portrays). Overall I give it 5 stars and would highly recommend it!",1387152000,2,523,4.574468085106383
4578385,1,B0055HK6VQ,"This is without doubt the worst Christmas movie I have ever seen and is the last Christmas movie that I would want my family to see. I imagine that at the end it has something good to say, but I just couldn't make myself watch it that far.",1381276800,,239,4.0

4578394,5,B0055HK6VQ,"Christmas Cupid is about a young woman named Sloane Spencer, (Christina Milian)who is a high powered Hollywood publicist. Sloane finds herself haunted by her recently departed client, Caitlin Quinn(Ashley Benson). Just three days before Christmas Caitlin takes Sloane on a journey to meet ghosts for her ex-boyfriends from past to present. Sloane runs into her old college boyfriend, Patrick (Chad Michael Murray) who is a doctor.  Sloane is dating/her boss, Andrew (Burgess Jenkins). Sloane has to make a choice on which guy she chooses.  Do you think Sloane ends up with Patrick or Andrew? Watch this movie to found out what happens to Sloane! It is a really cute movie. I would recommend this movie.",1353974400,2,702,5.095652173913043
4578395,1,B0055HK6VQ,"This is not the nice girl from Snowglobe. This movie has lot of drinking in it. The star is a sexually charged, drunk and the movie to me has nothing to do with the joy of Christmas and young children should not watch it. As an adult I thought the movie was junk and I wouldn't watch it again.",1352332800,19,293,3.983050847457627
4578396,5,B0055HK6VQ,This is a good movie just like A Christmas Carol only this time they did it differently and she had to confront three exs. One from her past one from her present and one from her future. The ex from her future turns out to be just as much a shock for us as it for her and saying anything further about him would be a great big spoiler. I probably shouldnt even said that much. She does end up with man she loves though. You should get this movie. Merry Christmas.,1342310400,4,463,4.043478260869565
4578397,1,B0055HK6VQ,"I love Christmas movies and yes, I even like the ones with the weak plot, predictability, etc. I just really enjoy watching Christmas movies, so I usually buy many Christmas movies each year (most of which I've never seen before). I think that this is the first Christmas movie that I've ever purchased that I will most likely be throwing away. Usually I would sell or give away a movie that I really didn't like, but I don't want people to have to watch it and waste their time (and I wouldn't want people to know that I owned this movie). It is not an appropriate family movie, unless you consider it okay to see a young girl die from choking on an olive during her drunkenness. At the end the girl supposedly goes to Heaven where it is a ""party"" of people drinking, etc. This was not the main point in the story, but it did establish it to be okay to get drunk all the time. Very disappointing. I have liked all of the abc Christmas movies: snowglobe, Holiday in Handcuffs, the Christmas List, etc. But this movie is a horrible for a Christmas movie or a family movie.

I would rate this a zero.",1336176000,3,1098,4.304347826086956

4578401,1,B0055HK6VQ,"Full disclosure: we are going through 1-2 hallmark type Christmas movies a day right now. We finish most but not all. This is the worst one we have seen this year. Gave it 15 minutes and just stopped. Acting is not the worst but the storyline and worse the writing is hideous. After seeing the ghost of her dead friend one lady exclaims in shock ""I see dead people"", a totally unfitting reference to 6th sense. And then just minutes later the same girl smiley and buddy buddy with her doctor friend. Just rubbish all around. A similar concept but FAR better executed was Christmas Magic.",1324339200,4,587,4.547169811320755
