7771049,1,B01GWDUA6M,over reliant on canned laughter for boring dialogue that utterly lacks humor.,1496361600,3,77,5.5
7771050,3,B01GWDUA6M,"Started out kind of funny but I'm sorry, laugh tracks just completely ruin it for me.  If it's funny, I'll laugh, I certainly don't need to be prodded. I bailed after 5 minutes or so.  It might be a great series but this robotic madness has always struck me as totally creepy.",1495843200,4,276,4.288461538461538
7771051,5,B01GWDUA6M,"Just when I think I've figured this out, it surprises and delights me with all the twists and turns and laugh-out-loud moments!  The three main characters are so harmonious and such good friends that they totally understand each other and accept all their flaws and mistakes along the way.  Utter silliness is mixed with plenty of slap-stick comedy and heart-felt moments.  It's such a creative mix that I can't compare it to anything else.  I totally recommend this!",1493078400,8,467,4.948717948717949
7771052,5,B01GWDUA6M,If you love British sit-coms this is for you. It's laugh out loud comedy.,1491868800,6,73,4.285714285714286
7771053,5,B01GWDUA6M,Very funny sitcom.  Great writing and a cast that pulls it off very well.,1491436800,5,73,4.214285714285714
7771054,5,B01GWDUA6M,One of my all time favorite comedy shows. Very funny. I re-watch the whole series ever so often and it never gets old. My only complaint is ut says three seasons but there is no season two.,1490054400,6,189,4.135135135135135
7771065,5,B01GWDUA6M,It's goofy laugh out loud. Characters are fantastic and original story lines. I wish there were more seasons.,1508716800,,109,5.111111111111111
7771066,2,B01GWDUA6M,"I love Tamsin Greig from Green Wing and Emma so I hoped I would like this show. But I did not.  I'm a fan of British comedies but this was not my cuppa.  I watched three episodes and could take no more.  The main character, Bernard, was too gross for me.",1505952000,,254,3.9411764705882355
7771067,5,B01GWDUA6M,I love this show. 3 short and sweet seasons that will quickly have you forever smitten with psychopaths. :),1502755200,2,107,4.684210526315789
7771068,5,B01GWDUA6M,"This is my 10th time watching it. So great! The scissor-panty moment is so phenomenal that I peed myself.  Another thing I love love love Black Books is that it is so original so the surprise makes the joke 10 times funnier. In fact, every second of it is solid gold if you are into dry humor or Dylan Moran.",1502064000,4,308,4.133333333333334
7771069,4,B01GWDUA6M,"British slapstick humor at its best.  Three friends who care about each other, get into improbable situations, and their humanity is evident even with all the pratfalls.  The only criticism is the utterly obvious and unnecessary  canned laughter.",1498262400,3,246,5.421052631578948

7771073,5,B01GWDUA6M,"Ignore those who give this less than five stars. It's one of a kind.  If you have any UK roots, you will positively love it.  It may be the funniest sitcom I've seen in decades.  Bernard is the funniest curmudgeon, and Manny played by Bill Bailey is incredible.  The script is worth the price of entry.  Tamsin Greig rounds out an incredible threesome. Amazing that it holds up 13? years later.  If you don't like wine slurping, cigarette smoking, book shop Irish sardonic humour, then go back to watching Friends. I also have a crush on Dylan Moran now....",1496793600,9,557,4.575757575757576

8764117,5,B01GWDUA6M,"Honestly this is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. I haven't laughed this hard in years. Of course, I should mention, this is not for people who do not understand/like British humor, or do not like a bit of wit in their comedies. That being said, I think anyone who likes shows like Big Bang theory would get a kick out of this, although this is much better, in my opinion.",1521590400,,383,4.1891891891891895
