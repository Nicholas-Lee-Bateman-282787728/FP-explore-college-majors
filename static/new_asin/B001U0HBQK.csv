3795188,4,B001U0HBQK,"As someone who absolutely loves the original Korean film ""A Tale of Two Sisters,"" I was initially really disappointed when I saw the trailer for this film; it looked as if the best stuff from the original had been stuck into a completely different and subpar story (the movie's changed name and the cliched ghost children didn't help either).
Well, good news: the film itself is much more like the original than the trailer suggests.  A few things have been changed; mainly some of the more confusing aspects of the story have been streamlined to make the film easier to follow (not a bad thing).  I didn't think the major twist was as surprising as it was in ""Sisters,"" but that could have just been because I already knew it was coming.  The film is well-directed, has a beautiful look to it, and the cast/acting is much stronger than in most horror films.
While not quite on the level of ""A Tale of Two Sisters,"" ""The Uninvited"" is a smart, well-made and very creepy horror film that is absolutely worth seeing.",1240617600,,1014,4.5911602209944755
3795189,3,B001U0HBQK,"The filmmakers waste no time setting up the conflict between Anna and Alex and Rachel. Early on, the directors keep us guessing if The Uninvited is going to be a traditional thriller with the evil stepmom or a supernatural thriller with the vengeful ghost of the mother? The filmmakers apply the usual scare tactics with sudden jolts but nothing truly horrifying, more like the fleeting thrills one gets on a rollercoaster. The typical nightmarish imagery is duly trotted out (keyholes that drip blood, creepy dead people coming back from the grave, and so on) but it isn't anything that hasn't been done a million times before.

If you've seen enough of these kinds of films, it is pretty easy to predict what happens next in The Uninvited except for a nutty twist ending which kind of comes out of left field. Although, in the case of this film that's not necessarily a bad thing. There's something pleasant in familiarity and The Uninvited certainly delivers in this respect.

There is an ""Alternate Ending"" which spells things out a little bit more but in a completely unnecessary way.

Also included are four deleted scenes with more of Anna's homecoming. There is another scene between Anna and Alex talking about visions of their mother. There is a nice, tense scene between Anna and Rachel. Finally, we see Anna and Alex getting ready for a dinner party with their folks and their friends.

""Unlocking The Uninvited"" is a making of featurette that gives away some major plot points so you should watch the film first. Cast and crew talk about how this film differs from the original Korean version. Emily Browning and Arielle Kebbel talk about how they were cast and how it was working together.",1240531200,2,1703,4.821917808219178
3795190,2,B001U0HBQK,"Well Hollywood does it once again by attempting to take a foreign film and adapting it to the mainstream market. Without going into detail, (don't want to spoil the movie) if you have already seen the original Korean version ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" this remake will feel like a let down, and will not ""thrill"" you since you already know the plot before the movie even begins. Hollywood followed the original Korean version almost to the letter, and I assume they bought the rights in order to do so.

The original version is far superior to this remake in my opinion, but if you simply cannot tolerate movies with subtitles or have no interest in Asian cinema, then  this version maybe worth a peek. I would recommend waiting for the DVD release. 2 stars for its lack of originality.",1239753600,2,783,4.585714285714285
3795191,4,B001U0HBQK,"The Uninvited begins with our protagonist, Anna, in a mental ward after dealing with the emotional trauma of losing her mother in a freak fire. As the film begins, her psychiatrist believes she is ready to go back into the real world and she is allowed to move back in with her father and her older sister, Alex. Unfortunately, father is now seeing Rachel, a nurse who was in charge of Anna's mother. This weird situation is further complicated by the fact that Anna is becoming more and more convinced that her mom wasn't killed in a freak accident...maybe she was murdered.

So if you have watched ghost movies over the last ten or so years, you basically know this film. It hits all of the major plot points, has a couple requisite twists and throws weird scares at you (it is based on a Korean film, you know). I expected all of this. I even expected one twist that I thought was revealed very early on. Even so, the ending still surprised me and I have to say that this film was classy in telling a familiar story. The truth is, there hasn't really been a genre-changing film in the ghost story genre for awhile now. The Uninvited is no different. So, what is important is not what is being told (as there's nothing new under the sun), but how it's told.

Here The Uninvited soars where a lot of recent ghost stories (Unborn, for example) have failed. The storytelling is far classier than it has any right to be, the script is well-written and convincing and the actors are terrific. Emily Browning, playing Anna, practically carries the weight of the film on her slender shoulders. With her forlorn and innocent gaze, you really start to feel for her increasingly desperate plight. Meanwhile, her sister is played perfectly by Arielle Kebbel who brings a sexy older sibling charm to the proceedings. And then there's Elizabeth Banks, playing the stepmother who might not be all she says she is.

All of this is pitted against a murder mystery or two and wrapped up in a perfect bow. There's not a dull moment in the film, the scares actually startled me, even when I expected them and some of the ghostly hauntings could give the weird factor of The Grudge/Ring a run for their money. It's effective and very well done.

I definitely recommend going to see it. The Korean film, A Tale of Two Sisters, is definitely in my scope now, to see how it stacks up. Go see The Uninvited if you're in the mood for a fun, classy and, yes, sometimes scary ghost story.",1238976000,63,2463,4.515695067264574
3795192,5,B001U0HBQK,"I didn't know what to expect, but was thankfully impressed by this film. Some might be dispointed with the movie, in this day and age of movie after movie that goes deeper and deeper into ultraviolence in place of real tension and raw emotion of say hitchcock movies. The scary part of the movie is how realistic and identifiable the plot is. If your looking for lots of blood guts you'll be disapointed. But I liked the movie a lot because it had lots of essential elements for a good movie: gets better with repeated viewings, well shot, expertly acted, good locations, several funny moments weighed in with dramatic parts showing the movie and creators didn't take themselves seriously, and the ending kept my friend and I discussing the movie well after it had finished. The ending goes by very quickly. I haven't seen the original, but I understand the movie is different enough to have added an additional character (perhaps they made it a remake so as not to be accused of ripping off the original.) I look forward to getting the DVD for the extras and whatever else is on there. Emily Browning and Elizabeth Banks are so punk rock. Definatley worth a look, and in contrast a great little film overlooked in favor of countless garbage movies the industry is endlessly churning out. Gimmie a break...",1238889600,2,1306,4.707423580786026
3795193,5,B001U0HBQK,"If you haven't seen the former version of this movie, you'll have nothing to compare it to as I didn't. Which is why I thought it was so good. It starts out scary....gets a little boring with the thought of 'it's an obvious ending'. Then completely wakes you up, to the point where you want to rewind it to see if you saw it correctly. After seeing it once, it has to be seen again. I can't wait to buy it.",1237680000,,406,4.0246913580246915
3795194,1,B001U0HBQK,"I almost gave this movie two stars for its professional acting and cinematography, however, the subject matter is so depressing and is too similar to other creepy thrillers, it also has the same ""surprise"" ending as High Tension, which was a much superior horror movie.

I didn't feel entertained nor did I like the selfish characters.  The subject matter was a major downer and the ending was just lame.",1237075200,2,404,4.840579710144928
3795195,4,B001U0HBQK,"I have been interested in this film, since I saw the previews. The story  is as good as the acting. I like the films strong cast, pushes the story. I expect to get suspensed. The film has good twists, that will surprise you. Two sisters makes sense, now.

3795198,5,B001U0HBQK,"I watched this movie, first, a year after it came out (2010). I bits of it later on that year and figured out a little bit more. This is the kind of movie you MUST watch at least three times to make sense of the whole thing. Such a well put-together movie! All the little elements line up, yet are hidden so well. I won't spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen it. The plot is great! I haven't seen the original movie that this is based on (The Tale of Two Sisters) but this was good enough for me. You get the horror, the suspense, the mystery, you can be a detective and put pieces together, and talk about jump scares! Watch this at night with no lights on and (in this day and age) plug in your headset. You'll be in for a real treat. The score is awesome as well. As I type this, one more VERY key ingredient of the movie just opened a door. WOW. I love this movie! Oh and Emily Browning <3",1505088000,2,898,4.022346368715084

3795203,4,B001U0HBQK,"This movie was disturbing on many levels.

The main characters are 2 sisters, Anna and Alex, their Dad and his fiance Rachel.

At the beginning Anna returns home.  She'd had a break down after her Mother burned to death in a fire.  Their mom had been ill for some time before that, and Rachel had originally been her nurse/care taker.

Throughout the movie Anna and Alex share many tender sister moments, and the usual teen drama.  As the story progresses they come suspect Rachel isn't who she claims to be.  They learn her name is a fraud, and believe their lives are in danger.  The fear and paranoia builds, and is eventually fatal - for Rachel.

That's when the really disturbing part is shown.  It's revealed that Alex had died, the same night as her mom.  Every scene with Alex had been a hallucination of Anna's.  One of the main characters had only existed in Anna's mind.  As had the threat Rachel had seemed to pose.  Rachel was harmless, and truly loved Anna's Dad.  Anna had murdered her in/from/with her delusions. Also Anna had been responsible for the fire, and had suppressed the memory.  She was very dangerous and completely insane.",1477872000,,1151,4.651741293532338

3795207,3,B001U0HBQK,"The Uninvited is a remake of the K-Horror film A Tale of Two Sisters, and it does include some cinematic reverence for the original movie. However, the original is far far better, and I'm not just saying that out of some kind of hipster snobbery. The K-Horror genre has a kind of gentility, spirituality, and deep fairness that are unique to their horror films - even those (like Audition, for instance) that are almost unbearably violent. The Uninvited misses most of those points entirely. However, The Uninvited is still worth watching for several reasons, most of which are the actors.

First, Elizabeth Banks is perfect as the ambiguously evil or not would-be stepmother. And David Strathairn is always good. Always. Emily Browning is wonderful as Anna, home from a long inpatient stay. And the cinematography is gorgeous.

However, unlike The Ring, Let Me In, and many other American remakes of foreign horror films, The Uninvited departs in several key respects from the source material, with, for me at least, really unsatisfying results. The twists are telegraphed from miles away. All of the complexities are smoothed out. And the scares are much less scary. More than that would spoil, and I'll let The Uninvited do that for you itself.

I recommend that you watch this for the fine acting and cinematography, but only after seeing the much superior Tale of Two Sisters.",1475884800,,1381,4.96969696969697

As a big horror fan, I spent most of the movie rolling my eyes at how cliche and bland it was...until the last 15 minutes. From there, I had my jaw on the floor, wondering how I'd missed the signs.

3795255,2,B001U0HBQK,"Did I miss something? Did I watch a different movie then what is reviewed here? I watched it on HBO because the reviews were so strong here but WOW! I would probably actually give it 2.5 stars if I had that option, but still! DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE BASED ON THESE MISGUIDED REVIEWS!

It is about a pretty girl who tried to kill herself after her sick mothers untimely death due to an explosion. It is based on a Japanese horror movie that I haven't seen but can't imagine it wouldn't be better then this. The film itself is framed well with lovely scenic areas & the actors are good looking (Elizabeth Banks has a major role) - so if you watch it for that reason alone I guess it is worth it.

But the TWIST ending? UM, yeah, not so much. At the end I thought -did I really just spend and hour & a half watching that & this is how it ends? I figured it out less then half-way through. Although one part of it I didn't predict but it was kinda stupid anyway. SPOILER & TIP if you are the only one that sees creepy looking dead people that scream MURDER at you, you have probably played a role in the crazy that your life has become!

You will not even sort of guess the end, super excellent.  I highly recomend this one!",1438646400,4,447,4.8933333333333335

If walking slowly toward billowing curtains, or partially opened doors, is your idea of taut, tense, suspenseful horror.... maybe you'll like it. But for me, no thanks.

In the first 2 minutes of this film we see every tired 1990's JHorror gimmick in the book - blood drips from locks, heads pop out of bags, a mental patient says something ""spooky"".  Going by the reviews you'd think this was something cool to watch, instead we are treated to a 14-year old Angelina Jolie lookalike pouting, crying, screaming, pouting and then pouting some more.  She is beautiful yea but this is not a horror film just a very tired ripoff of The Grudge.

The Uninvited is one of the best psychological horror films I've ever seen. This movie is really well acted, well made, and the ending is truly shocking.

It is hard to talk about this film without revealing the big secret, but I'll do my best. The film is about a girl named Anna who goes to live with her dad, stepmother, and sister. Anna and her sister don't like their stepmother, and they think that she is using their dad. Throughout the film, Anna has visions of ghosts, and she and her sister start to think that their stepmother is a murderer.

Anna begins to have haunting visions that may link Rachel to the accident. The Uninvited is a solid horror film, although very predictable.

This is a remake of ""A Tale of Two Sisters""; the stories aren't exactly the same, but they share many similarities. This film consists of some creepy imagery, jump-scares, and mystery; it's balanced well enough, and moves at a moderate pace. The plot twist is very predictable - whether you've seen the original or not - as it frequently drops obvious hints and it's usually the first guess most people think of when they know a twist is coming. Regardless, the ending is also good. The acting was also great. Not a very memorable film, but not a waste of time - of course, if you have time to spare, there're plenty of better horror films to watch.

Overall, The Uninvited is a good horror film, but very predictable and forgettable; if you watch a lot of films, you've likely watched a film like this before. I recommend a purchase for hardcore fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

The Uninvited has some disturbing imagery, violence and blood.",1367884800,2,1250,4.698630136986301

3795358,3,B001U0HBQK,"Hey!  I wrote a review for this movie last year.  Where is it?  What did you do with it amazon???  Reviews don't just vanish in the night like Jack the Ripper!

The Uninvited is about a girl who has agoraphobia- a fear of public or enclosed places.  Hey wait!  I may be partially agoraphobic.  I have a fear of public places but NOT enclosed places.  Stuck in the middle, just like the way it's always been.  Meh, I doubt I have anything close to what the woman who stars in the Uninvited has.  At least, not if this ""potentially far-fetched for the purpose of entertaining horror fanatics"" movie is any indication.

Anyway the movie is about a young woman who either experiences symptoms of agoraphobia or perhaps this is Hollywood's exaggerated version of agoraphobia- I'm not knowledgeable enough in the subject to determine which one.

The girl (played by Emily Browning... I think) spends most of her time fighting these symptoms inside her home.  Her much older husband who's more appropriate as a father-figure (and perhaps should have been written into the script as such) is sometimes around to lend help, but often is out of town on business trips or wherever husbands go when the wife is stuck at home having problems in these type of thriller movies.  Unfortunately if you have no personal experience with agoraphobia that either you or someone close to you has experienced, the Uninvited is going to present itself as a big, confusing mess with little to no logical explanation for any of the events taking place.  And surprise surprise- that's the predicament I'm facing right now.  How do I rate such a movie?

Basically the girl spends her days touching and feeling walls to make sure they're actually there, believing that something bad is about to happen at all times so she takes an extremely cautious approach to everything, sees distorted walls and shadow figures either outside the front door or inside her house, and hides under a blanket in bed assuming it's a safe protective place to stay without anybody harming her in any way, etc.

This is honestly too much for me to understand.  It basically means that, if you run with the agoraphobic or any phobia gimmick, you can practically do *anything* you want to warp the viewers imagination.  However the consequence is not much in the way of coherent or logical writing material so many of us end up starring at the TV screen in confusion.

I can sum up the Uninvited like this- the actual horror is just a series of severe symptoms of agoraphobia with added sound effects making the condition appear as frightening/disturbing as possible.  With that said, it's not a bad movie- at least all the confusion provides several moments of uncertainty and unpredictability.  That's better than being bored. It's pretty much what saves the Uninvited from being a disastrous movie.

Update- July 16, 2013.  Wow, and I thought the agoraphobia plotline was confusing- amazon said that I have NOT written a review for this movie, so when I went to type a review, guess what happened?  The original review I wrote on December 12th of last year magically appears on page 2 but NOW it's the new review I'm writing down right now, replacing the old one.

Another uninspiring American remake of an Asian horror film, this one being 2003's `A Tale of Two Sisters' which is a personal favourite of mine. Packed with cliche scares and predictable plot twists it just becomes another unoriginal thriller that we've seen time and time again. One thing I admired about the original was the guilt ridden protective sister relationship; here i felt nothing for the sisters, turns out Anna is just a guilt free nut-bag...boring! The acting is good but not even Emily Browning's performance can save this. Watch it for bikini teens, skimpy nightgowns and excessive cleavage; about all this movie is good for.

It's another one of those American horror films that are remakes of Asian films, but out of all the others, (""The Ring"", ""The Grudge"", ""One Missed Call"", etc.), this is one of the smartest remakes.

3795377,3,B001U0HBQK,"The Uninvited (Charles and Thomas Guard, 2009)

I am coming into The Uninvited in what may actually be an unique situation; I realize the film is a remake of the Korean smash hit A Tale of Two Sisters, but I don't really much care. Unlike every other devotee of Asian horror films I know, I was pretty unimpressed with A Tale of Two Sisters (viz. 2-6-2006 issue, and I've actually since revised my rating down to 3 stars) given its sterling reputation. An amusing side note, though: I did find it interesting that the Guard Brothers, instead of keeping the original title, switched it out for one used by another Korean film released the same year, directed by Su-yeon Lee, a paranormal mystery that is in every way superior to A Tale of Two Sisters (in fact, it was rather high on my list of the best films of the decade). This film, a pretty straight remake of A Tale of Two Sisters, has nothing at all to do with Lee's Korean film of that name. More's the pity.

Bros. Guard, in their first feature-length outing, introduce us to Anna Rydell (A Series of Unfortunate Events' Emily Browning), who as we open is in a mental institution, about to be released. Her shrink (TV character actor Dean Paul Gibson) believes she can get no better while still there, and needs to go home and heal with her family, or what's left of it. There's her father, Steven (L. A. Confidential's David Strathairn), and her sister, Alex (The Grudge 2's Arielle Kebbel). There's also her late mother's nurse, Rachel (The 40 Year Old Virgin's Elizabeth Banks), who's now romantically involved with dad. Anna and Alex are not at all happy with this turn of events, and after poking around, come to believe that Rachel may not be who she says she is. The problem, of course, is convincing dad that Rachel may be after more than fun times...

My friend Mariel posited that this movie exists solely to showcase Emily Browning in her underwear. I'm not going to argue with that, mostly because I'm too distracted by Emily Browning in her underwear. I'm also willing to, at least on the surface, give Guard 1 and Guard 2 props for some of the trickier stuff they pulled off successfully here. Problem is, none of it's really original. (It wasn't original in the original film; either; the Big Reveal montage is nicely done, but was a great deal subtler in another, earlier film whose name I can't tell you, because it would blow the twist entirely.) Which leaves us with a movie that's all style and no substance, but I don't think of it as sacrilegious, as so many others do. Like the similarly capable Shutter remake, this movie simply struck me as being unnecessary, rather than being bad. (That said, I also cannot comprehend people who refuse to watch movies with subtitles; I'm sure they find this film necessary in the extreme, if they're curious about the original.) Thus, I'll put forth the following: let how you felt about the original be your guide here. If you thought it was the cat's pyjamas, you're probably going to hate this. On the other hand, if you could take or leave that one, this one won't offend you. Which sounds like a lose-lose proposition, so the kicker is how you feel about the idea of Emily Browning in her underwear. For me, that's a win. ** ",1299542400,,3248,4.5756013745704465
3795378,3,B001U0HBQK,"Not really sure why it looks like it's cold in the poster because the movie is not at all like that. Just a little side comment to get us started.

I watched this movie last night with a few friends; 2 of which had already seen it so I knew a scary moment was coming when they would cover their eyes.

This always helps as I don't enjoy scary movies.

The Uninvited is about a girl whose mother died in a fire, her father is living with the live-in nurse, and the sisters believe the nurse killer their mother.

Starring Emily Browning as Anna, the main character, who just got home from the nut house and begins to have dreams/visions of her dead, burned mother along with three children who seem to have a connection to it all (think Stephen King's The Shining).

David Strathairn as her father: maybe he killed his wife...they did it before when the good guy actor plays the villain (What Lies Beneath)

and Elizabeth Banks (Betty Brant in Spider-Man) as the new girlfriend/fiancee.

This is a psychological thriller that has a self-promoted twist ending. You may see it coming if you pay close enough attention throughout the film.

With some situational cussing (in fear) and some sexual content (looking through keyholes), this movie didn't quite leave a lasting impression. The twist was nice but I'd have to watch it again to catch everything.

And I don't think I'd care to do that.",1294099200,3,1391,4.59919028340081

But the Guard boys missed the point of the original movie, and as a result have made a boring, unscary and pointless film out of a terrifying, bittersweet one. The basic problem is the stepmother--the stepmother in Two Sisters is insane; she has to be insane in order to make the plot work. They seem not to have realized that.

As I recall, it was a simply terrible film that wasn't very scary, was frankly boring, had actors that deserve MUCH better than this, but oh, that ending. I still remember the ending. Looking back on it, the ending actually helped the movie since I still remember it. This movie should by no means taken seriously, so I will not write this review seriously, instead, I shall try to remember all I can about it without looking it up online.

Alright, so the main girl comes home to her lake-side house to live with her father after a stay at a mental institution, where she was coping with her mother's death. Her sister is there, and her father, played by the great David Strathairn, who has a new girlfriend in the form of Elizabeth Banks. Elizabeth Banks is playing the role of the evil step-mother here. The main girl thinks Banks is only there to still her father's money, and then kill him, but why she is so evil to the main girl. The main girl also finds out that Banks might have been a babysitter that killed a few kids or something, and the main girl is also haunted by the ghosts of the kids, and the kids pop out as ghosts and provide the ""scary"" moments.

In the end, the main girl and her sister are almost killed by Banks and then... My mind gets fuzzy. I'm sure it wasn't important. Point is, the main girl was actually batcrap crazy the whole time, and imagined most all the proceeding events. Her sister is actually dead and died in a house fire that killed the original mother, and it was all started by the main girl accidentally, which made her insane. Thus, Elizabeth Banks was actually a nice person the whole time and was not evil. There's something to explain away the ghosts or something, and the main girl actually kills Elizabeth Banks in real life, rendering her ultra batcrap crap crazy, and poor David Stathairn is left without his girl friend, and an insane daughter that has basically killed (accidentally of course) his entire family. Let's see if I was right (Hold on while I look up the plot to gauge my accuracy)...

Alright, so it was even more crazy than I originally remember. Wikipedia has the full plot details here: [...]

Point is, if you watch this movie, you'll be mildly entertained, but not in a good way. This is a stupid, stupid movie that's as crazy as its main character and is not really recommendable to anyone, unless reading the plot synopsis really interests you.

Note: I wouldn't mind Elizabeth Banks trying to kill me. I'm just saying...",1284336000,,2593,4.496815286624204
3795386,4,B001U0HBQK,"I just watched ""The Uninvited"" for the first time and I really enjoyed it. It's sort of like 3 movies in one because it is layered with a lot of depth and character development. It's like looking at an intricate picture; each time you stare at it the picture looks different because you're watching it from a different angle.

Emily Browning played Anna impeccably. She totally captured all of the emotion, terror and fear that this young girl was experiencing throughout the entire movie. Elizabeth Banks, playing Rachael (the resident home wrecker) was also wonderful to watch because some of her lines and mannerisms were so outrageous and over-the-top (I loved the part when they had the fancy dinner engagement  and she went off in the kitchen).

Some have described ""The Uninvited"" as a ""horror"" movie. As someone that has seen my fair share of horror I don't know how much it would fit into that category. The movie is certainly creepy, and very suspenseful and eventful, which had a lot to do with Emily Browning's character and Arielle Kebbel (as her sister Alex) who was also fantastic.

When I first watched this movie I didn't hate the Rachael character as much as I hated the father (David Strathairn). He just seemed so out of touch with his daughters and their own needs and was only thinking of himself. And perhaps to make the story flow a little more seamless the father was often missing in action which allowed the girls and Rachael to take over the burden of rounding out and shaping the plot. But after I watched this movie again I had a much different perspective, he seemed much more multifaceted and dimensional than I had first thought him to be.

""The Uninvited"" is currently in rotation on Home Box so if you have a chance to watch it I certainly recommend it. I did take off 1 star simply because the beginning was rather slow-moving, but it sure picks up a lot of momentum.

Watching ""The Uninvited"" will remind you of that old proverbial reference: when the cat's away the mice will play. The question is, who's the cat and who's the mouse?",1283644800,9,2071,4.644808743169399
3795387,5,B001U0HBQK,"I love classic ghost stories and psychological thrillers -  the ones that don't have a lot of gore but do have sympathetic characters you can feel anxious for plus an element of mystery. A number of people have pointed out that this is a well done movie but doesn't have a lot of new elements. I have to point out that there have been no truly surprising plot twists in ghost movies since ""The Sixth Sense"" came out - the best ghost stories since then have all had plot twists that are some variation of that famous movie or older horror films. There has also been a deluge of remakes of Asian horror films, the Ring and the Grudge being the most famous, plus a host of others I can't even recall right now. The Univited contains elements from everything: Asian horror films and your favorite old thrillers: The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Poison Ivy, Hide and Seek - I could go on and on.

None of this impeded my enjoyment of the movie. All the necessary elements are there: 1. A huge house in a gorgeous wooded and secluded setting; 2. A dangerous intruder in the form of Dad's former mistress now fiance who invades the family sacred space and threatens to turn him against his daughters; 3. A concerned but distant father who puts his traumatized daughter's needs after his own sexual ones; 4. Two very sympathic daughter heroines - the younger one ethereal and tormented by something she saw but can't quite remember and the older one sassy and assertive but funny rather than annoying and 5. The mystery - how much of what we are watching is real and what is perception? Can we trust the perceptions of our heroine or is she crazy? Are the ghosts real? Is the stepmother a killer or just an opportunistic - well, you know what.

The photography is beautiful and the acting is good. The two girls are fantastic and Elizabeth Banks as the ""wicked stepmother"" has a subtle nastiness that contrasts wonderfully with her summy, sexy exterior. The actor playing the father comes off as sympathetic and tormented instead of slimy even though you want to shake him for his cluelessness.

I don't want to give any of the surprises away, so let me just say that this is one of the few keepers for me in the ghostly genre. It will do fine until the next ""Sixth Sense"" or ""the Village"" comes out - and I have a feeling I could be waiting quite a long time for another original.",1282953600,7,2372,4.45852534562212
3795388,5,B001U0HBQK,"The Uninvited is an amazingly intense suspense thriller. I must commend the directors, the Guard Brothers, for their incredible work on this film. Their work in this film is equal to that of Alfred Hitchcock, director of many suspense thrillers such as Psycho, Dial ""M"" for Murder, Vertigo, and The Birds. It's almost as if Hitchcock's spirit was raised from the dead to possess the directors of this movie to make one last effort before he laid to rest forever. But everyone knows that Hitchcock's mark on the world will never fade away, and this movie is proof of that.

This film is about a young woman named Anna (played wonderfully by Emily Browning), who returns home from a mental hospital after her suicide attempt following her mother's death in a boathouse fire while she was ill. She is greeted by her sister Alex (played by Arielle Kebbel), father who is a writer, and his new girlfriend Rachel (played by Elizabeth Banks) who was Anna's mother's nurse. Strange things come to Anna's mind as she adjusts to returning home, such as strange apparitions of her mother, as if trying to warn her of what's to come. This film has an intense surprise ending that one would not even guess till the very end.

The exquisite and intense camerawork, acting, beautiful and mysterious score, and plot that is similar to Hitchcock's Psycho makes this a thriller that I'll be watching for years to come.",1282780800,5,1400,4.757201646090535

  I don't want to give too much away so I'll just give you the gist of the story. Two sisters thing their mothers former nurse(now their fathers girlfriend)was responsible for the death of their mother some months ago and they will everything they can to prove it.

3795392,3,B001U0HBQK,"About ten minutes into the movie I began to experience a chill up my spine.  No not from the storytelling, but from the scenery!  I was having that deja vu feeling of having been there before, the incredibly lush and tall trees, the rocky craggy beach, the formidable cliffs and the stormy sea.  It all looked like Harpers Island, the thriller series from CBS that we enjoyed so much last year.  In a way, THE UNINVITED is a lot like Harpers Island, only not as scary, but they share a predilection for a good grabber twist.  Suffice it to say that we stayed for the credits and noticed that the movie was filmed on Bowen's Island in British Columbia, indeed the exact same location that Harpers Island was filmed at.  Good spotting!

SPOILERS AHEAD.

I want to know what kind of direction do they give a character like Elizabeth Banks plays here?  My observations extend not only to Rachel, the nurse played by Banks, but to all similar characters in similar plots.  ""Director, what's my motivation?""  ""Well, we want you to look evil and forbidding, even though it will turn out that you are completely innocent.""  ""How do I do that?""  ""I don't know, maybe freeze up your face as though you'd just swallowed a tube of botox, and glare through your eyes as though squinting in the sun.""  I have to give Banks credit for playing a difficult part, though I think she was cheating as we saw the movie again, she definitely seemed to be trying to portray a ruthless ""angel of mercy"" type serial killer nurse, and that got me to thinking, maybe they gave her a different script than the other actors got, one in which she was definitely the killer.

THE UNINVITED was a movie so dull, in which nothing happens really, that it makes you immediately suspect all this chazzerai is only the setup to a twist ending.  Well, we didn't figure out the ending (except we knew the killer's identity from the beginning), but the surprise wasn't worth the drawnout family drama of these super rich white people!  I have heard that the house on Bowen's Island is for sale and they are asking 8 million dollars (Canadian) for it!

I don't want to go too much into detail because I don't want to spoil anything for people who have not seen it but It is a MUST for people who love a good suspense thriller with some horror.

3795401,4,B001U0HBQK,"So I am one of those people who absolutely love horror movies, even the crappy ones like 'The Ring'. So with this movie I had no idea what it was about until me and my cousin rented it.

For those who don't know 'The Uninvited' is about two girls, one of which has been recently released from a psychward after the strange death of their mother. They both start investigating the past of their father's new girlfriend (who happens to have been their mothers former nurse). Later they come to the conclusion that she setup the murder of their mother and they try and get people to believe them.

Anyways, I would reccomend this movie to most people who love the creepy kinds of movies.  It really isn't a movie that makes you want to have bad dreams for a week, but their are a few parts thay could be certified as 'creepy'. Furthermore, the movie is really good especially the ending!(which happens to be one of the biggest twists I have ever seen in a movie!",1259366400,,959,4.406779661016949

I think that is part of its cleverness to let your guard down and think you know what to expect. There are many scenes where you know what's coming, but still made me jump! The acting is very good for this type of film and I have to admit I was surprised at the ending. The film has a few good shocks, creepy images, brisk pacing and the last quarter of the film completely validates the clich's that plague the rest of the film. 'The Uninvited' is a very good shocker with a few great surprises!",1258934400,2,602,4.2894736842105265

3795404,4,B001U0HBQK,"After the fire, everything seems to have changed. The woman that was supposed to watch over the matriarch of the family is now in the arms of the father, and the daughter coming home finds this disturbing. Worse still is the mystery of the night itself - what happened, how it happened, who caused it - there seem to be a thousand questions spinning like a loom in her mind. This leads her to question everything and everyone, and to wonder why she keeps seeing her dead mother, looking at her and pointing out the window to the tune of one word: ""murderer.""

The first time I watched The Uninvited, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit. There are twists and turns that are unexpected, people that seem like horrid only to be victims, and terrible calamities that await anyone caught in this unexpected maelstrom. The dead are not quite in this movie, either, making their presence known as they piece together things that a broken memory does not contain. Still, things are not what they seem and, at the end of the movie, the tune sung is not what I expected. I liked that - being surprised for a change - because most movies are easy to figure out. This one can be figure out if a person sets out to do it as well, but the horrific camouflage that hides the plot is thick enough to keep one from guessing the true ending.

Another great thing about this movie is the first time you watch it with all the answers in your pocket. This casts a strange light on everything and shows you just how much your implied sensibilities make you guess at the answers you think you have. In truth, I enjoyed doing this more than anything, and I say this because it shows the characters without the smokescreen they throw up. This makes for an interesting showing, not better than the movie the first time around but great nonetheless, and made me happy that  had the chance to scan the show once more.

If you like your horror creepy, then you'll enjoy this. It has some terrible parts inside the storyline, with bodies snapping to stand and terrors limping across the floor to make contact with our main character. In some places I actually felt for her, and this made me all-the-more happy when I watched it on the second go. If you are thinking, ""I should skip this because it's a modern movie,"" then you would also be wrong. It appeals to a range of people that enjoy movies both new and old, and even took me - an old school horror junkie - for a nice little ride. While it has its points of horror it is also a psychological tale, and the feeling that you get at first, thinking you have the answers, is a deceptive one. I recommend at least watching it twice, just to get the feel of knowing and then not really knowing, just to show you how well the actors did in their roles. Normally I would not recommend a new-school movie, either, but this is one that I think is worthy of praise.",1257379200,,2877,4.3719626168224295

3795406,5,B001U0HBQK,"I was so relieved that this American version of The Uninvited was not patterned after the Asian film of the same name, but rather after the Asian film A Tale of Two Sisters. The Asian version of The Univited was long, not frightening, and entirely too boring. The Asian film A Tale of Two Sisters was very engrossing, only there were some variances in culture, which I am not well versed in. This version of The Uninvited begins with Anna being released from a mental institution in much better condition that the girl in the Asian film. She is trying to remember the events that took place the night of the fire in which her mother died. Her father has written a book and dedicated it to Anna and her sister Alex. He also surprises her by saying that he has taken up with her mother's former nurse Rachel and later tells her of his plans to marry her. Right from the start, Anna is suspicious of Rachel, feeling that she is somehow involved in her mother's death. If you have seen the Asian film A Tale of Two Sisters, then you will know what plot twist is to come. Alex tries talking to her father about Rachel, but he doesn't seem to hear her. They even managed to include the strange under-the-sink scene, which I consider to be THE MOST STARTLING SCENE OF ANY MOVIE I have seen up until now. I knew it was coming, but I still jumped.

The ""tale of two sisters"" within the film is actually quite touching. I really enjoyed the sister's chemistry - it was very authentic. What great young actresses! It made the twist ending all the more powerful!

I would have given it another star - but after watching it I had a strange feeling I had seen it before. It kind of made me think of The Sixth Sense and The Others.

3795412,3,B001U0HBQK,"Long before the American remake came out, I watched the Korean ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". Not only was that amazing, it became one of my favorite films of all time. Now, of course, as soon as I heard of the remake, I had doubts. Usually Hollywood really screws up Asian horror but I tried to be positive.

So I'm watching the movie... so far so good. A couple of scenes they kept faithful to the original which, as a fan, I was very appreciative. The music score was really, really pretty. I loved it. Also, LOVE the sister (named Rachel, I believe). The actress that played her did an amazing job and gave her lines great personality.

And then it all goes a bit down from there. Many of the ""scary"" lines were laughable. I mean, did they really try to make those scary or were they kidding? Picture this:

There's a ghost girl crawling out from beneath the sink. She's cover in blood and slime. Her hair is soaking and dragging on the floor. She tilts her head to look up at you. You back away as fast as you can. Unfortunately, there's a cabinet behind you, but you wouldn't DARE look away. You want to know when to dodge the creepy girl. The girl looks up at you and then growls, ""You're next."" Huh? I'm sorry, can you say that again? ""I'm next?"" Is that the best you could come up with? That's not scary at all! The scene is instantly lost and I'm reminded that it's a Hollywood ""horror"" movie I'm seeing.

The twist at the end... well... it was better in the Korean one. Much better. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to see this and once they get to the American twist ending, they'll be thinking, ""That's the oldest one in the book!"" I know I was.

Still, it was a good movie. It was shot well, I liked the acting, it was a nice set (though some sets were clearly in a studio somewhere). Perhaps if I hadn't seen the Korean version first, this would have been a bit better. Do yourself a favor, buy ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" before buying this.",1248912000,,1957,4.221925133689839

The Uninvited was a fairly scary movie and the acting was pretty good. The story follows Anna on her journey home fresh from the asylum where she takes up with her sister to rid the household of her father's girlfriend whom they fear is a murderer and has doom in store for them.

There are a few twists and turns that keep the story engaging and some parts of it were fairly frightening. The actress who played Anna, also starred in A Series of Unfortunate Events, was  good in this film too.

3795414,4,B001U0HBQK,"This movie is NOT a remake of the well-known 1940's movie of that title starring Ray Milland. I had thought it might be, and so had initially steered away from it. However, this film is an original script with an unfortunately recycled name. Actually, the title is unfortunate on several counts. Not only does it suggest duplication of that previous classic, but it also misleadingly suggests that some ghostly manifestations might play a role.

I'm not giving anything away by telling you that there are no ghosts involved here. That becomes almost immediately apparent. So if you favor supernatural explanations and lots of spooky supernatural threats - this isn't the movie for you. This is a realistic look at a reunited family that seems to be developing a dangerous dynamic.

If you are a long-time fan of psychological thrillers and suspense stories, you might think you can detect a familiar plot device coming into play here. You might begin to suspect that there is either more or less than meets the eye. I won't say whether that expectation is fulfilled or not.

The ""Guard Brothers"" (who do we thing we are? the next Coen Brothers? those Matrix guys?) take one of the most artful Korean films of the past decade, a subtle, beautifully-acted thriller with gorgeous art direction and photography, and turn it into a dumbed-down piece of Hollywood kee-rrrap of the worst order. And who cast this thing? The vulnerable younger sister of the original is now recast as a taller, sluttier older sister, utterly destroying the dynamic of the original story's central relationship. The severe stepmother of the original has been turned into a bleach-blonde cliche. David Strathairn is the only remotely appropriate casting, and he is sleepwalking through this, clearly just picking up a paycheck to build a new wing on his house. From there, the krapmakers (they aren't filmmakers) decide to tinker with the original story in ways that just make the new version either more stupid (an enormous, drippy tank of fuel inside boathouse that just happens to be housing these girls' invalid mother?) or simply more obvious.

However, when I watched the DVD, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked it. First off, this isn't a horror film per se. While it does use some horror elements and seems to have been marketed as a horror film, it really isn't. In the special features section, I believe one of the directors describes the movie as ""a tragedy disguised as a horror film"" or words to that effect. I think that describes it rather accurately.

While I can see why some people may have found the plot predictable, I think the casting of Emily Browning as the main character balances that out. Even when you find out what kind of person she is at the film's end, you still don't want to believe it.

And I think that it's good the film didn't heavily concentrate on special effects to scare people. A lot of the fear and tension created is just editing and misdirection. Remember, sometimes the scariest thing is the thing you don't see.",1245196800,,1022,4.430851063829787

3795418,4,B001U0HBQK,"A friend lent this one to me, and I had no idea it was based on A Tale of Two Sisters.  But before long, I had could see that the writer and director were either remaking the earlier film, or stealing the best images from it.  Upon reading through the end titles, I saw 'Based on . . .' and I felt vindicated.
I'm a huge fan of J and K-Horror, and A Tale of Two Sisters was one of the first ones I purchased.  It's a very good film- maybe not the classic some people say it is, but very good nonetheless.
And usually, American remakes are less-than-stellar in my opinion.
However, I really liked what they did with this film.  They captured the essence of the original, without trying to make it a carbon copy or worse, going in a completly different direction.  It's a fine balancing act, and I feel they pulled it off nicely.
There are certain points that bothered me, such as the two sisters piecing together the 'true' identity of their new step-mother.  Or the dream sequence stuff . . .
That's the difference between Asian Horror and Western Horror: Hollywood feels compelled to burden us with grounded logic.  Why do we have to know the history of the step-mother, or the possible connection to a previous murder scenario?  Why couldn't the step-mother just be a loathesome individual, like in the original?
And the dream sequences . . . It seems that scary stuff can ONLY happen in dream sequences, according to Hollywood.  Of course, the girl then wakes up and things are fine . . . OR ARE THEY?  MWAHAHA.
In the original, everything was simply nightmare reality.  There was no waking up from it.  To me, that's a much scarier scenario, where the writer and director aren't hamstrung by logic . . .
Oops.  Sorry for the rant.
Anyway, even shackled by Western sensibilities, this movie manages to succeed.  In fact, I'd consider it a perfect starting point for someone curious about Asian horror.",1245024000,,1904,4.529239766081871

I was in ""ho hum"" mode for most of it, and kept telling my husband, ""Maybe we should just shut it off and find another one to watch.""

That is, until you actually hold it up to the film that it was remade from, the Korean horror smash A Tale of Two Sisters.  Emily Browning stars as Anna, a teenage girl who returns home from a stay in a mental institution, and along with her sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) come to distrust and suspect that their father's (David Strathairn) new girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks), who was the former nurse for their ailing mother, played a role in their mother's fiery demise.  There's a good amount of gloomy atmosphere to find in The Uninvited, and even some twists as well, but none of which that amounts to a whole lot compared to what's found in A Tale of Two Sisters, which is far, far superior in terms of shocks and a dynamite ending.  The scares here are predictable and, well, unscary to say the least, and it's hard to decide who comes off as creepier, Browning or Banks.  Other than having Arielle Kebbel in a bikini, there isn't a whole lot to really recommend The Uninvited.  While it isn't as terrible as PG-13 rated Asian horror remakes usually tend to be, in the end you're better off checking out the original film it is remade from if you want to see a truly haunting, psychological, and truly scary horror flick.",1244246400,7,1351,4.493877551020408

If not a Korean remake, then a sequel to a long-ago classic--like Terminator, Halloween, Star Trek, Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Today's Hollywood has no idea on how to make an original thriller--so they give us junk like this. Sure enough, I did discover that this movie was a korean remake and I wonder if there are any more horror films made by Koreans to feed the zestful appetite of HOllywood? In this movie, there's nothing remotely horrible.

You have vapid performers who are not very attractive and they always end up doing stupid things.  I wish we could get a mature, talented actress--like Naomi Watts who made a remake of ""The Ring""--in the main role. this movie appears geared for the teeney-bopper crowd because most of the main characters are all teenagers.

3795426,1,B001U0HBQK,"I agree with Paul Bens' assessment (May 24, 2009) of this movie.  Fortunately, I rented the movie for a very cheap price ($1 at a Red Box rental machine).  Had I paid more I would have been seriously annoyed.

If you're looking to watch this movie for its horror content, please do not waste your time.  I was a big fan of horror movies when I was in my early 20s, and I've seen many.  This movie doesn't even raise the hair on the back of your neck.  I think there were about three instances in the movie (totalling maybe two minutes) when it almost began to get possibly kind of scary.  As a horror movie it utterly falls flat.

If you're looking to watch this movie for its psychological thriller content, you won't fare much better than you did hoping to be scared by it.  In this regard it was lackluster and predictable.  There are far better movies available to give you this kind of thrill.

Overall, this movie was basically 87 minutes of my life gone down the drain.  Save yourself the boredom and pass on this one.",1243296000,2,1025,4.336842105263158
3795427,1,B001U0HBQK,"I rented this movie on the strength of David Strathairn's involvement in the project as he is one actor who can always be counted on to choose good material.  Unfortunately, this is the one time where Strathairn's judgment seems to have been off. Hugely off.

I won't go into the details of plot, because if you've seen any horror film in the last 25 years (especially The Sixth Sense) you've already seen everything this remake of a Korean movie has to offer done better...and in far superior pictures.

Saddled with over the top, one-note performances, this movie is undone early enough by casting of Emily Browning, a lead actress who seems far too young for the role she is playing, and one also woefully unprepared to bring any depth to the role. Arielle Kebbel is only marginally better, at least she is age appropriate for the role, though the character is about as cardboard cutout as you can get. But hands down, Elizabeth Banks as the ""evil"" Rachel Summers is so far over the top that you expect her to do the Dr. Evil pinky to the mouth maneuver about 30 minutes in.  Demented is the only note she chose to play and she plays it with a capital D.  Strathairn is left to toddle about as the poor old widower with the hot, younger girlfriend and other than say ""Anna"" with a disapproving look every once in a while, there is little for him to do.  And what little there is for him to do, he doesn't do well.  Gone are any layers that I always expect from one of our greatest actors.

With a weak script and extremely unimaginative direction, this movie is really relying on it's ""twist"" ending.  It isn't a twist you've never seen.  In fact you've seen the twist done quite often.  And often.  And often.

Possibly one of the worst movies I've seen this year, the Uninvited should remain that when it comes to your movie-viewing choices.",1243123200,4,1846,4.5075075075075075
3795428,4,B001U0HBQK,"The Uninvited: DVD Review

Grade: B

...and the person for whom the bell tolls isn't always the person you think it is. A strange-yet it works well at times-mixture of drama, suspense, some frights, and some good old fashioned mystery, The Uninvited may come off as at first being just another remake of an Asian horror film.

But it manages to be so much more that that, and although it is not perfect, The Uninvited has to be the best remake of a Asian film i've ever seen.

Anna (Emily Browning) has just been released from a mental institution 10 months after her mother's death, and is finally going home now, to her boyfriend, her writer dad, and her, well, lets just say outgoing sister. But arriving home she finds a newer surprise...Rachel (Elizabeth Banks, showing her creepy side). She used to be her mother's maid, and just so happened to have the night off when Anna's mom blew up, along with the rest of the gasoline-filled boathouse where she was staying. Anna now thinks that Rachel killed her mom, along with some other kids from past experices; Anna basically thinks that Rachel is a serial killer, now after her and her sister.

And that is just the beginning of he plot. There's a whole lot more going on in this movie, almost too much for its tight 87-minute running time, but The Uninvited still manages to wrap everything up in the end, along with a couple (did I say A LOT?) of plot twists and changes.

But too-crazy-for-itself plot is the only problem in the movie; the casting and acting is pitch-perfect. Browning, aside from her terrible fake crying, plays the part well, Alex, her sister, makes you truly believe her plot that Rachel is the bad guy, and the father truly looks like he's fallen into Rachel's hands just like a puppet. Yet nobody does a better job at playing their role than Elizabeth Banks does playing Rachel, everything about her-her evil looks, her evil motions, even her voice at time (""I won't allow it..."") is creepy. Banks always does a good job in her roles, but this role is truly convincing to watch, even if you don't like the rest of the characters.

So in the end this is probably the best remake of an Asian horror flick out there, and if you want solid acting and a somewhat-solid story, The Uninvited would be your best bet around.",1243123200,,2293,4.564476885644769
3795429,1,B001U0HBQK,"Following a tragic fire and a stay in a mental institution, teenage Anna (Emily Browning) returns home to find her widowed father (David Strathairn) preparing to remarry. His love interest is the nurse (Elizabeth Banks) hired to care for Anna's now deceased mother.

Anna joins forces with her sister Alex (Arielle Kebbel) to try and dislodge the nurse. As they ask more questions about the fire that claimed their mother's life, the girls become convinced that the nurse is not who she says she is. But proving this to their father seems impossible, for he regards them warily and seems to believe everything he hears from their stepmother-to-be.

The Uninvited is a remake of the Korean horror film Janghwa, Hongryeon (released here as A Tale of Two Sisters) directed and written by Kim Ji-woon. The original was only released in 2003, and is superior in every way to the Hollywood version. In fact, the Korean version is so beautiful and the English language adaptation is so awful, the comparison calls for an accompanying rant on the very practice of adapting recent foreign hits for American audiences.

It's great to see artists of the caliber of Kim Ji-woon being paid for the rights to their work. If only the people buying those rights would honor what they buy. What is the point of remaking a film with a devoted following, and distorting or throwing out every element that excited fans and critics about that work? Wouldn't it be better to have a U.S. distributor re-market the original with the aim of making it more popular? It seems to me that the expectation of American audiences is dismally low in Hollywood. Or is it pure xenophobia that makes the majority of our film producers believe anything good still ought to be re-titled, re-focused, and given a Western cast?

Leaving the general social attitude and getting back to The Uninvited, the problem with adaptation is demonstrated perfectly in the DVD extras. There the film's directors and producers talk about why they were drawn to the project. The directors praise their favorite Korean horror films for their emotion and ambiguity. The producers also note the ambiguity of the original, and then go on to explain how they and the writers systematically did away with that ambiguity, because it was confusing and made the story ""hard to follow.""

In other words, they were not bright enough to understand or interpret the original to their satisfaction, so they made it simpler and more stupid, for the rest of us. Unfortunately, all of the changes made to A Tale of Two Sisters turned The Uninvited into just another cheap ghost flick sprinkled with teen angst.",1243123200,8,2639,4.881696428571429

3795437,3,B001U0HBQK,"Produced by remake king Roy Lee and directed by Charles and Thomas Guard, ""The Uninvited"" is a remake of Kim Ji-Woon's South Korean blockbuster hit ""A Tale of Two Sisters"". Well, actually this film is more of a re-imagining of the Korean horror film; it does have the original's main concept, throws in a few iconic sequences from the original, but has an entirely different premise. Let's get right to the point, ""The Uninvited"" is VASTLY inferior to its South Korean counterpart, but would provoke curiosity from the original's fans (as I am).

Released from a mental institution after a suicide attempt, Anna (Emily Browning) hopes for a happy reunion with her sister, Alex (hottie Arielle Kebbel, John Tucker Must Die) and their father Stephen (David Strathairn). She finds that her dad is currently making whoopee with their deceased mom's former nurse, Rachel (sexy Elizabeth Banks, Slither) and this relationship may indeed stand in the way of her family's happiness.

I loved the Korean original and that would be my standpoint in this review. I will try to stick along the reins of this film, since this film is no comparison. ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" had certain thought-provoking elements and gave a very mind-bending cinematic experience. The original was meticulously executed, brilliant and is ANYTHING but conventional. This ""Americanization"" is your basic Hollywood offering, very routine and offers little surprises. I do have to give some credit to the directors since it avoided another shot-for-shot remake, too bad the end result is a little dry. No wonder that American Horror has fallen in popularity the past few years. It takes a supreme effort for me to even remember a real great serving of Hollywood horror.

The screenplay in this film is a little too routine and telegraphs its punches too soon even for those who never saw the original. The clues to the mystery were very obvious especially to the experienced movie watcher. Thrills and scares will always have to contain emotions, the viewer has to form even the smallest amount of attachment so the characters would feel real and a script can grab its audience. ""The Uninvited"" tries but falters, its build ups to its suspenseful moments feel uninspired and its dialogue a little sour. The film does try to become a ""crisis of conscience"" emotional struggle in a way, and mixes in a few supernatural elements along the way; the problem is, it just couldn't achieve an engagement to its plot.

The puzzle pieces were very predictable and was uninspired. It fumbles through its exposition of its mystery with very obvious clues that even a teenager can spot. It was fairly obvious that the direction was struggling a little midway through the film, the Brothers Guard kept relying on the usual conventions of Asian horror such as creepy ghost children, mild ghoulish images, a mystery and the critical ingredient; a surprise twist in the climax. I guess the plot did set its groundwork which is why I didn't hate the film, but it was very routine. The usual plot mechanics are omnipresent in the film.

Elizabeth Banks is one very attractive lady, she is quite distracting to look at. Banks is a decent actress, but she was burdened by the script to maintain a creepy, intense presence that she was almost reduced to a cheap villainess. Emily Browning did the best she could given the limitations of the screenplay, but even divine intervention couldn't save the film. Browning is a talented actress, and the poor girl is just lost in the limitations of the script. Arielle Kebbel makes for good eye candy and I tolerated her somewhat unconvincing portrayal, but I feel that she failed to form a unique kind of chemistry with Browning as with their Korean original counterparts.

Although a bit disappointing, ""The Uninvited"" is still decent compared to other servings of Asian Horror remakes. This is a masterpiece compared to the remakes of ""Shutter"" and ""One Missed Call"". It suffers quite a bit with its lack of suspense and its attempts to generate tension proved very lackluster. One redeeming quality is its twist at the climax, it wasn't as brilliant as the one in the original, but at least it set its groundwork so it didn't feel like a throw-away detail. Unfortunately the journey between its beginning and its last act does feel very dull. It just played its aces too soon that it all felt rudimentary. I wouldn't really advise to see this film unless you're very curious as to how the magnificent ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" get ""Americanized"".

3795444,3,B001U0HBQK,"Based on the popular Korean film `A Tale of Two Sisters', `the uninvited' is more of a tragic film not a horror film that ultimately rocks you with its shocking ending.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""the uninvited"" features a very clean transfer as it sports a MPEG-4 AVC codec at 1080p (Aspect Ratio: 1:85:1).  The shots are primarily dark and low-level lighting and no artifacts or low-light noise were evident.  Outdoor scenes were vibrant in colors with blue skies, trees in the background.  Blacks are very good and no artifacting.  Overall, the picture quality was very good and you can see the detail of the talent's faces and surroundings.

As for audio, the film features a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.  Some scenes that are there to frighten, really come out quite strong from your front channels.  I didn't hear too much subwoofer usage or rear channel usage.  But for dialogue, dialogue was crystal clear, as was the music.  This film is not much of a horror film, so there were no major action, horror sequences.  If anything, there were short bursts of tense and frightening segments that were strong and really done well to frighten the viewer.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

This Blu-ray disc for ""the uninvited"" comes with three special features in high definition:

  * Unlocking the uninvited - Nearly twenty minutes long, this featurette goes about how the producers came across the Korean film and then purchasing the rights for the making of a new film for the English speaking audience.  Interviews with the directors, the Guard Brothers, the producers and also the talents of the film.  Emily Browning (with her Australian accent) and Elizabeth Banks talked about their first impressions of each other.  How the goal was to not be the same as the Korean film which was artistic but to come close in the final cut.  We also learn how difficult it was to find the home where the film would be shot and what alterations they were allowed to make in the home and for the alternations they couldn't make, they had to use less light in those scenes.

  * Deleted Scenes - About five minutes long and four deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes were not integral to the film but one does feature Anna and Alex discussing her dreams and how Anna didn't want her father to know or else they would think she's crazy and send her back to the mental hospital.

  * Alternate Ending - About a minute long, for this alternate ending, let's just say that I'm glad they didn't use it in the final cut.

JUDGMENT CALL:

First, I must say that ""the uninvited"" is not a horror film, it's a tragic film with a few horror elements.

For anyone expecting a horror film, they are not going to get anything anywhere near what is shown in theaters today.  If anything, the film is actually clever, creepy and enjoyed how the film was building up to this shocking ending which I admit, I was not expecting.

It was great to see Emily Browning as the main character of Anna, now slightly older since her appearance as the young Violet from the 2004 film ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"".  Her portrayal of a teenage girl who is haunted by these dreams and images makes you care for her character and thus makes the ending quite surprising for the viewer. I was amazed to hear her talk with a strong Australian accent during  the special featurette and then turning the accent off for her character.  All in all, she did a good job.

Arielle Kebbel who plays Alex did a good job and its another horror film for the young actress since ""The Grudge 2'.  David Straithairn as the father Steven is a well-known actor who has been on many films (""The Bourne Ultimatum"", ""Fracture"", ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", etc.) and plays a father who cares for his daughter but at the same time, conflicted when his daughter tries to hurt his relationship with Rachel.  And Elizabeth Banks (""Zack and Miri Makes a Porno"", ""W"", ""Spider-Man"" films) who has come off a string of theatrical hits plays the nurse and fiance of Steven.  Playing a character of mystery until we reach the unraveling of the film at the end.

Overall, ""the uninvited"" was an entertaining film.  Like any Asian horror film that is being remade in the US, remakes tend to make people who are familiar with the original film, tend to give the automatic thumbs down.

Having watched a good number of these horror films from Japan and Korea, I never expect to see an exact replication for the English adaption and I just take it for what it is.  And ""the uninvited"" is a tragic film with a few moments of creepiness but it's the ending that I felt was quite clever and gave the film that extra creepiness.

Anyone expecting horror/slash elements will probably be disappointed because the film doesn't strongly go in that direction.  But as much as I found ""the uninvited"" entertaining, I still recommend everyone to watch the original Korean film ""A Tale of Two Sisters"".

As for the Blu-ray, picture quality and audio quality were pretty good.  It's just that the special features were a bit on the small side and the film was short and average at best.

Otherwise, if you are a fan of any of the talents in the film or want an entertaining, creepy popcorn flick to have in your collection that is not gory or overly bloody and sadistic, ""the uninvited"" may be worth it for you to check out and possibly adding to your Blu-ray collection.",1240876800,,5378,4.64021164021164
