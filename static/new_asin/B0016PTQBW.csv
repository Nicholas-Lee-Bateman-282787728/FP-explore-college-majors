8264062,5,B0016PTQBW,"This is the first set of four episodes of the Magi Nation TV series, based originally on the 2000 collectible card game.  It includes the first episodes and 3 other episodes as well.  It's a nice introduction to the world, as it follows Tony Jones, who traveled from our world to the Moonlands, on a quest with friends Edyn and Strag to become the final dreamer, and stop Agram from escaping the core of the moon.  They use magical spells and powerful creatures to battle the forces of evil and often throw a bit of intelligence and learning in for good measure to outsmart the villains.

Definitely appropriate for all ages, it shows good morals of courage, honor, and loyalty, as well as being a great adventure and introduction to the world of Magi Nation.

Only complaint is that there aren't more episodes, and that they aren't in order.",1246752000,9,842,4.624161073825503
