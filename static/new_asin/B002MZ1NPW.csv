And now I'm really glad that I did! Despite she's not the main character in this and doesn't even play the kind of vivacious characters she's mostly remembered for, this is still a very nice and memorable comedy. Phyllis looks rather serious most of the time, but still so beautiful and charming.

Aside from Ms. Haver, there were only other two familiar faces to me in it: a very young, pretty and cute Mary Astor, and an intentionally ""aged"" for the role Ernest Torrence, both of which are wonderful, as usual. The rest of the cast was awesome, too, especially the leading man, Cullen Landis. I must confess I wasn't even familiar with his name till I saw this movie, but I really got impressed by his performance in a ""dual"" role in this, since he played equally great both the naive and then the bully, and was truly a hoot as the latter.

The print quality of the Grapevine Video DVD is very nice indeed, much better than I expected, sepia-tinted and rather clear most of the time. As for the score, it's made of pre-recorded music that fits rather well all the scenes. As a bonus, there's a super-funny Felix the Cat silent cartoon (""Felix Doubles for Darwin"", also from 1924), which -by the way- was the very first of his that I ever saw, but made me instantly a fan and left me wanting more.

I totally recommend this DVD, either if you're a fan of one of the actors/actresses in it, or just a silent comedies fan. It's rather dynamic and doesn't go on forever, barely over an hour, and doesn't have a dull moment.",1425686400,2,1759,4.389570552147239
