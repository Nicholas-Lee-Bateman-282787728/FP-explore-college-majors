7999818,2,B0000D0YWA,"This story tells the truth about how blacks in Mississippi feared the intrusion of the freedom riders because they were afraid of possible repercussions from City officials; especially the sheriff.  The storyline does well until the end, where the little girls play on a tire-swing together (one white girl and two black girls).  If that is what the storyline means by Children leading, I was lost.  I thought the children would have come to a public meeting and gave the blacks the courage they needed to allow the voter registration efforts by the freedom riders, but that did not happen in the movie.  Maybe it did do that, in a book.",1522108800,,637,4.711711711711712
