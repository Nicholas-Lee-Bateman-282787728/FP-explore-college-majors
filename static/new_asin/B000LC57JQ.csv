8161046,1,B000LC57JQ,"The things that are wrong with this movie start to accumulate quite fast. First of all Merlin and King Arthur have American accents. Morgana has a British accent but it sounds fake. Also the characters have a habit of using twentieth century slang. During the first five minutes I heard Merlin say to Uther Pendragon, ""everybody's a critic"" and I very nearly turned the movie off.

For reasons that were never explained Uther Pendragon takes his five year old son (Arthur) onto the battlefield and when Uther's troops are losing badly he has Merlin take little Arthur to someplace safe. What parent takes their five-year old son into a war zone? Is he TRYING to get his little kid killed? Doesn't he have a castle with thick stone walls and a moat? That's where I'D keep my small children to try and protect them from homicidal adversaries!

At any rate the ""safe place"" Merlin chooses for the little boy is the streets of Los Angeles, California in the late twentieth century. Arthur has never seen a car or a bus or an SUV before and during his first few minutes in this ""safe place"" he very nearly gets run over by a car because he was standing in the middle of the street.

Merlin erases Arthur's memories and makes plans to come back for him when he's a teenager. He never puts any thought for how Arthur is going to find food to eat (remember Arthur is five-year old child at this point) or protect himself from pedophiles. Merlin just sort of hopes that a small child with amnesia can fend for himself on the streets of Los Angeles for ten years.

It doesn't really get any better after that. There are several scenes with sword-fighting and the actor's lack of training on how to wield a sword really shows. The dialog is bad, the acting is bad, the budget is quite low and despite the fact that Merlin and Morgana are both wizards, there's hardly any type of magic or magical spells in the entire movie.

I can't think of ANY reason ANYBODY would ever want to watch this movie!",1331337600,,1986,4.490304709141275
