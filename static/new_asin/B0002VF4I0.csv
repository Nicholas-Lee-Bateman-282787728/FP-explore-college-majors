8032958,5,B0002VF4I0,"This series shows the begining of one of the finest series ever made for televison.
Having seen the complete series over the years it is interesting to see how it developed.
The characters themselves start to come to life very early, Horn Rim Harry, Tooley, WPC Wallace,.
Most of all Jack Frost himself, he does not seem to change much even to the end, always getting the better of Supt Mullett, right from the first episode of backing into his car.
He continues to show the compassion and wit that continues throughout the whole 15 series.
A must for all Frost fans",1400544000,,566,4.5588235294117645
