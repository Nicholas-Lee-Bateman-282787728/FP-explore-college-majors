8316090,1,B001KSYVVU,"If you are looking for a dvd of yoga exercises to reduce your blood pressure, don't waste your money on this one.  It is not a guided exercise program, it is simply an introduction to many different yoga poses.  They don't give you enough time to complete the poses before moving on to the next one in the hour long dvd.  You'd have to memorize all the poses and do them on your own to get the full benefit.  The most annoying thing of all is the horrible music that plays so loudly you cannot hear the voice over instructions.  Plus, the copy I got would not play on my DVD player and would only partially play on my computer.  I was extremely disappointed with this product.  And, the seller MusicIndia didn't even have the courtesy to respond to my request for a replacement for the defective DVD.  Total waste of money.",1249689600,9,823,4.368421052631579
