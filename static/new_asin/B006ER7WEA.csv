8496895,5,B006ER7WEA,"This is an excellent DVD.  Well produced and recorded.  Even more footage interviews than their first video. See my review of the Knoebels Haunted House - by Laff in the Dark.  This is more of the same and now two dark ride/attractions are included - lots more footage - same price.  And stay tuned, with folks like us buying these and encouraging the creators, even more such DVDs are in the works in the future.  Check the Laff in the Dark web site for more possible DVDS in the future.  Maybe from a dark ride/attraction like at Kennywood, Camden Park, Conneaut Lake Park, Virginia Beach, Ocean City MD, Idelwild, Indiana Beach or other such places with classic Dark Rides.  I'm and ACE and DAFE member and hope that you buy this DVD and encourage Laff in the Dark to make more videos as well.",1356825600,,796,4.486111111111111
8496896,5,B006ER7WEA,"For those of who remember dark rides (not the new ones with blood, gore and torture) this is your DVD. Video is excellent. Sound is excellent. Ride thru and walk thru of the attractions with and without the lights. Plenty of history and an up close look at the individual ""gags"". Almost like being there.",1351209600,,304,4.545454545454546
