8307955,5,B001H5QCN6,"I saw some of Family at War back in the 70's and was very impressed with it.  The later episodes brought home how very long post war Britain was rationed and deprived.  It was far from the boom USA enjoyed after the closing of the war.

I was hoping the series might be available through Netflix, but no.
I did find parts of the series at Amazon but alway with the warning the DVDs would not play on Region One DVD players.  I gave up.

But then I purchased a french version of Pride and Prejudice for $2.00 at a library book sale.  Thinking that it would have English subtitles and forgetting about the Region One or Two restrictions.

When I inserted the DVD, I was offered a menu that had several Regions on it.  I chose Region 2 and it worked. When I put Region One DVDs in, I was never offered this menu.

So I came back to Amazon and ordered this set.  It is engrossing as ever and seeing British stars, i.e. John Nettles and Barbara French, in their early careers has been great fun.  I will continue to check out Amazon for more episodes.  My no frills Dell Computer w/DVD player has given me an extra capability and my reunion with the Ashtons has been warm and as inspiring as it was almost 40 years ago.",1287532800,2,1214,4.230434782608696
