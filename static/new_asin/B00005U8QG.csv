Dajaun Wagner. The Paul Mcphearson dunk from the free throw and the blocked shot at the top of the sqaure were sick and much more if your from Da CHI you gotta check this out we are truely represented we need a little Will Bynum, Luther Head, Ronnie Fields and Michael Hermon to make this complete though but this is gonna make you get the nextt one holla back!!!! remember the last two years we been givin it to New YORK!!!!!

8183119,5,B00005U8QG,"I've seen all the ball dvd's out there and what I like about this tape was the variety of footage to check out.  The tape is hosted by the infamous DJ Whoo Kid  featuring raw hoop footage edited to  50 cent - that alone is sick- there is a small section on brooklyn's sebastian telfair and  young ... kobe footage from high school- that was tight-  the section with dj stretch armstrong is funny-  the ...  puerto rican  princess at the end got me  a lil chubby-  I was feeling loose watching this tape-
I recommend this tape for those who live this-",1021420800,4,550,4.252427184466019
8183120,1,B00005U8QG,"This DVD was a waste! It was unorganized, the moves were wack, and I couldn't stand the host. The DVD kept drifting on to other topics besides basketball that I didn't give a damn about---like the host's car, how rapper 50 Cent got shot, etc. Then they had a tribute to Kobe who I'm not a fan of @ all. They had some dudes talking about how great Kobe is and you can CLEARLY see that they were getting paid to say that cause the way they expressed themselves looked like they could have cared less for Kobe. The ONLY good thing about this DVD was this HOT chick that they interviewed who was an adult film actress (Straying for the topic of basketball again like I mentioned earlier). Truthfully, she was the only reason why I've had this DVD for so long (1 Month) and why I've given this movie 1 star. ""Ball Above All"" was a MUCH better DVD than this [piece]...""The NBA's 100 Greatest Plays"" is better than both of them...And the AND1 DVD is hotter than all of 'em. ""Ballin' Outta Control"" is horrible AND ghetto! I'm about to sell this DVD right now...",1020384000,3,1054,4.328282828282828
