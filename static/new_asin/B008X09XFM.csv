8531564,5,B008X09XFM,"Strangers on a Train, 1951 film

Two cabs drop off two men at a train station in Washington DC for long distance travel. Bruno Anthony makes his acquaintance with Guy Haines, the tennis star. Their characters are quickly established. Bruno is a friendly stranger (a bad sign?), and ne'er-do-well rich man's son. Bruno has the idea of committing the perfect murder: no motive to point to the killer. Guy humors Bruno instead of telling him where to get off (not a New Yorker). Guy's wife, pregnant with another man's child, no longer wants the divorce. Guy is so angry he threatens to strangle her. We see Bruno described as a ""naughty boy"". Bruno's father threatens to get medical treatment for him. [Does the apple fall far from the tree?] So Bruno goes ahead with this imagined contract, He stalks Miriam, Guy's wife, who goes to an amusement park with two men. [This shows popular entertainment before television.] And Bruno carries out his self-appointed mission.

Guy returns on another train. Bruno is lurking in the shadows of night to see him. The police drop by Guy's home. Guy visits Ann Morton, a Senator's daughter, and hears of Miriam's murder. There is humor in the Senator's remarks. The professor on the train remembers little. Now Bruno begins to stalk Guy. [The police don't notice this?] There is a funny scene at the tennis club where people's heads move mechanically, except for one man. Bruno's conversation with the Senator shows his increasing insanity, and so does his trick with the old lady. He is so weird it can create a scandal in Washington! Ann Morton figures out what happened: her sister Barbara resembles the late Miriam Haines! The watching detectives also see that ""something funny is going on"".

Guy calls Bruno to tell him his plan will be followed. [We see a watchdog that doesn't bark at a stranger?] There is a surprise here! The police learn of Guy's absence from home. Ann visits Bruno's mother, but little is accomplished. Bruno plans his revenge. Luck upsets Bruno's plan when the lighter slips from his hands. A crowd watches its retrieval. Once again Bruno visits the amusement park [remember them?] waiting for the darkness to cover him so he can plant Guy's lighter at the crime scene. The merry-go-round plays ""Ain't We Got Fun"". Guy shows up to follow Bruno, there is a fight on the carrousel while ""The Band Played On"". There is a dramatic finish to the ride, and the truth is discovered at last when it slips from Bruno's hand.

You can pick out some faults in this story, but it seems quite good with its mixture of drama, suspense, and humor. This plan for a ""perfect murder"" has one obvious flaw. Most murders occur between people who know each other (husband/wife, boyfriend/girlfriend, parent/child, lender/debtor, etc.). After the first murder the police will investigate the likely suspects, one of which will be the co-conspirator. Raymond Chandler should have known better than to use this plot. ""Murder by organized crime is seldom solved by the police"" said ""Perry Mason"". ""Unless they arrest the wrong man."" Wasn't this one of Hitchcock's creepier movies?",1421452800,,3121,4.8830188679245285
