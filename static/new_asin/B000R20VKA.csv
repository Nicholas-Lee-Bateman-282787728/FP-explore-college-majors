8198374,5,B000R20VKA,"I already had Arc of Infinity in region 1 format and that is a 5 star story. I purchased this region 2 box set in order to get Timeflight which was a bit pricey as a region 1 title, I had heard that Timeflight was a bad story and not actually worth getting however that information was wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed Timeflight.

Timeflight was a somewhat unique story in that it was also used to advertise British Airways in an agreement similar to the many military stories during the Pertwee years. Many times product placement style shows tend to oversell the product but this was pretty low key and that just made the story a bit more believable, A 4.5 star adventure overall with the Kalid performance by Anthony Ainley being just a bit over the top although I liked how they hid the fact that Kalid was actually the Master (even changing Ainley's name in the closing credits until the Master unveiled himself).

Now Arc of Infinity I loved and gave this a 5 star rating. I tend to like the Gallifrey based stories the best and this story added in the return of Omega, thought long gone after The Three Doctors story from the Pertwee era. Although this Omega wasn't as good as the original Omega, it still played good. It was also fun seeing Colin Baker in the story, before he was chosen to be the next Doctor.

Having a region free DVD/BD player, I have found region 2 titles are often less expensive than the region 1 titles are and they are exactly the same except the region 2 titles include an insert with some additional information, I was able to get two stories as region 2 for far less than it would cost for either one of the stories as region 1.",1436400000,,1660,4.400651465798045
