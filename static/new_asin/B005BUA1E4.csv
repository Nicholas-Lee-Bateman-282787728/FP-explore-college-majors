4647329,5,B005BUA1E4,This show happened to be one of my son's favorite childhood programs. I am so happy you decided to make it available to your customers. We look forward to you allowing more programs like this available to the fans. As always Amazon gets 5 stars from us. Thanks!,1288396800,,261,4.458333333333333
4647330,5,B005BUA1E4,"It's about freakin' time! I've been waiting for this show to come out on DVD for a while now, cause I've missed watching it on Nick since I was younger, So whenever I can, I'm DEFINITELY buying this.. can't wait to watch it again!!!",1287100800,,232,4.295454545454546
4647331,5,B005BUA1E4,"The Ahhh Real Monsters: Season 1 DVD set is well worth the purchase! I had previously bought (from the Nickelodeon rewind collection) Rockos Modern Life: Volumes 1-3. Now the Rockos Modern Life DVD set were not the greatest quality, specifically there were issues with the DVDs playing on my laptop and even on my DVD player.
Now that sucked about the Rockos Modern Life DVDs. However the Ahhh Real Monsters: Season 1 DVD set is much better quality all around. Better packaging, well just much better production all around. I have not had any issues viewing the discs as I did with Rockos Modern Life.
I have viewed the first two discs without any problems but I will update this if this does not remain the case.
To the Amazon.com powers that be, please realize the market for these products exists (obviously you do as these shows are being released), they have a strong fan base who are adults now and want to invest in these awesome products (shows) to pass on to their children. So please continue to produce high quality products like the Ahhh Real Monsters: Season 1 DVD set. If anyone at corporate reads this, can you get me some better quality Rockos Modern Life DVDs, because I think this show deserves a much better produced product than it has previously been given.",1287100800,2,1278,4.65929203539823
4647332,5,B005BUA1E4,This box set is well worth it! Yes there are no extras (which would have been nice) but the episodes are adapted well and seemingly not edited in any way. There's a good amount of episodes per cd and the episode count overall is well worth the price. So grab your copy and snuggle up to perk up your 90's nostaglia :),1286928000,2,317,4.129032258064516
4647333,5,B005BUA1E4,"Oftentimes I'll want to see something again because I remember loving it as a kid. Then I'll rent (or even buy) it, pop it into the DVD player and stare blankly at the screen, wondering in dull horror: ""How did I ever think this was a good show? What sort of brainless child was I?"" That didn't happen this time. In fact, I may have enjoyed the show more now than I had as a child.

Aaaa! Real Monsters is not at all some uncreative, dumbed down ""kid's"" show. It was actually quite imaginative and the characters were all unique and memorable. Watching Ickis, Krumm, and Oblina making their way through monster school was entertaining and I did not at all feel that I should be embarrassed for popping in one DVD after another even at the age of 26. It had exactly that daringly dark, twisted touch that those who love the Burton ""style"" and Invader Zim should be able to enjoy. And, something nice: Oblina, although female, is a unique and likable character, rather than some reflection of one of the boys or serving as merely a figure for the male characters to bounce off of.

So, for those of you sitting on the fence, unsure whether to make the purchase, wondering whether or not this show you once loved will withstand the test of time, don't fret. It absolutely will.

I desperately hope the other seasons debut on DVD. I will buy it without hesitation.",1284336000,9,1360,4.475806451612903
4647334,4,B005BUA1E4,"Talk about being down in the dump, these monsters take that literally. Meet Ickis, Krumm and Oblina three students of the Monster Academy who are learning all the best scaring techniques. Ickis has his Looming (growing) ability, Krumm has his stinky armpits and Oblina has her contorting ability. So, are you scared yet? Don't worry, they don't eat humans, only garbage. But they're ready to bring their scaring skills into your living room. So turn out the lights and grab your security blanket because the monsters are back in town! I'm very excited about this release as I've been waiting for it for a few months now but I gave it four stars out of five because of the above price. They could have fit thirteen episodes on two discs instead of three which would have saved all of us some money. It would save Amazon money for all these discs and would save us another ten bucks of the cover price. This is one of Nick's best though (not to mention one of their darkest) and I would recomend it for anyone who might have Invader Zim on DVD also as this would be a good companion piece to it. Thanks Amazon, your prices could be a little better but it looks like you're coming around with the season sets now. Just fix your prices and I'd say we have an accord.",1283212800,4,1262,4.420600858369099
4647335,4,B005BUA1E4,"What a great show from Nickelodeon this was, from Nick's own golden era of shows like Doug, Rocko's Modern Life and Pete & Pete among others comes another long awaited gem of a show. I know we all wish these shows would come out on proper release season sets with extras but these Amazon MOD seems like all Nick is doing these days for the 90s shows.

The cartoon debuted in 1994 and lasted 4 seasons containing 52 episodes in total. The premise is the young monsters are in school learning how to scare humans, many times through out the show they venture up from under the dump where they go to school to visit humans and scare them. Lots of hi-jinks and personality can be found in these monsters, fun for all ages! There were many monsters with zany characteristics but the 3 main ones most would remember are Ickis who is located on bottom right of the dvd package art, he could grow large to scare humans, then you had Krumm on the left bottom who carried his eyeballs in his hands or even in his mouth at times and his specialty was using his foul armpit stench to scare which was quite comical. Then we have Oblina a female monster who could pull out her internal organs, transform herself and was one of the best students in the school. They sure don't make many cartoons like this nowdays!

Something must be wrong though with the time listing here Amazon, as it only shows 90 mins run time, I mean 3 discs and the first season of episodes do not add up to 90 mins, hope someone there corrects that info. Due to this error I am not sure if this is truly all the season 1 episodes but here is a list from a cartoon database of season 1. *Update "" In the comments section I been told these MOD sets are always listed as 90 mins length so I guess we can assume this is the complete first season and just a generic run time listed here""

Season 1 (1994 Original air date)

1.""The Switching Hour""
2.""Monsters, Get Real"" & ""Snorched If You Do, Snorched If You Don't""
3.""Curse Of The Krumm"" & ""Krumm Goes Hollywood""
4.""Monstrous Make-Over"" & ""A Wing And A Scare""
5.""Krumm's Pimple"" & ""Monster Hunter""
6.""Monsters Don't Dance"" & ""Gone Shopp'n""
7.""Old Monster"" & ""Mother, May I?""
8.""Don't Just Do It"" & ""Joined At The Hip""
9.""Smile And Say Oblina"" & ""The Great Wave""
10.""Cold Hard Toenails"" & ""Attack Of The Blobs""
11.""Chip Off The Old Beast"" & ""The War's Over""
12.""Where Have All The Monsters Gone?""
13.""Simon Strikes Back"" & ""The Ickis Box""

The cartoon rocks, pick it up if you enjoyed the Pixar Monster's Inc movie.

Pros: We finally get to see Aaaah! Real Monsters on DVD and get a full season set instead of a "" Best Of ""
Cons: No extras to be heard of.

After all these years, it's even more gross to me than it was when I was a teenager, but it is pretty funny. As far as the educational factor? I guess it teaches kids valuable lessons about friendship, but I don't believe education is a main focus, these little monsters are all about laughs &fun...

It contains wit and humor that adults may find enjoyable. It is a great 1990s show. It is mildly funny and amusing. If you watched Ren and Stimpy, then you probably remember this and like it.

4647457,4,B005BUA1E4,"I was quite pleased when I ran across Monsters on Amazon. What a hoot! I remember catching a few of these back in '94 when the series premiered, but never caught many as life, the universe and everything caught up with me. Occasionally I would think back and wonder if maybe it would come out on disk sometime. How much fun when I found both Monsters and Tak and the Power of Juju both on Amazon Prime!

The monsters live in the tunnels under an unnamed city, going to Monster School, and learning how to frighten humans. The 'stars' of the show are Ickis, Krumm, and Oblina. Oblina, the female sidekick, is striped black and white, with a huge mouth, bulging stalk eyes, and the ability to reform herself into various and sundry horrible looking creatures, while Ickis can grow his big-eared, big-mouthed body to an impressive size. Krumm, (yes, Krumm is rather dumb) holds his eyeballs in his hands and attacks with a case of BO strong enough to knock over a warthog. Together, they go through the same (but different) trials and tribulations of any trio of class nerdy-misfits, working together to get through school and find their own identities as monsters.

This is a lower scale of violence from some other cartoons in the ""old style."" I haven't worked my way through all of them - I am taking my time and enjoying as there won't be more when I get through the ones on Amazon, but so far no worries for parents of the younger set. The monsters can be scary, of course, but in a gentler manner that shouldn't frighten the little ones.

4647566,5,B005BUA1E4,"I reviewed the previous Nick Rewind/DVD-R set and now I finally have my hands on Shout's release. Which one do I like better? Definitely Shout's! I'll go through the details first.

Aspect Ratio: Original Full Screen  (1:33:1)
Languages: English, Spanish
Subtitles: English (For the hearing impaired)
Running Time: 5 hours
Openings and endings included in each episode (In the DVD-R set, the opening was only played at the beginning of each disc)

Episodes (played in airdate order)
Disc 1:
1. The Switching Hour
2. Monsters, Get Real & Snorched If You Do, Snorched If You Don't
3. Curse Of The Krumm & Krumm Goes Hollywood
4. Monstrous Make-Over & A Wing And A Scare

10. Cold Hard Toenails & Attack Of The Blobs
11. Chip Off The Old Beast & The War's Over
12. Where Have All The Monsters Gone?
13. Simon Strikes Back & The Ickis Box

Pros: The picture quality is a lot cleaner and smoother than the DVD-R release. The DVD-R sets were priced at about $40 for each season. A bit too much for 13 episodes if you ask me. The price for this set is very much at an affordable price for everyone.

Cons: There is still some grain but this was released in '94 so that's understandable. There's also no extras. I'd be great if Shout! could add some original commercials, bumpers, etc, to their Nick releases.

Overall: A very nice upgrade from the Nick Rewind sets! It's so great to be able to watch these nostalgic cartoons again. :) Can't wait for Season 2!

Note: I grew up in the 90's and when the show first came out, I remember being afraid of it. In the late 90's, As I grew older, I began to enjoy it more. So to parents with young children, this cartoon may be a bit too scary for children under 6. If your child is sensitive to monsters or anything scary, I would not recommend this for them.",1323302400,8,1988,4.342318059299191

4647570,5,B005BUA1E4,"I grew up watching this show on Nickelodeon back in the 90's. I was scared of this show, but at the same time enjoyed how different it was compared to other cartoons at that time. I used to have an Aaahh!!! Real Monsters t-shirt that i got from BlockBuster, in around 1997, when they used to sale Nickelodeon items. I used to catch re-runs of this show on NickToons Network aired it when they first began in 2002. So imagine my shock when Shout Factory announces that they have the rights to release classic 90's Nickelodeon shows like Aaahh!!! Real Monsters & Rocko's Modern Life on DVD. Finally a proper DVD release for these great Nickelodeon shows.

The only problem i ran into with this DVD release was the limited release that this DVD received. Target, Wal Mart, even Best Buy did not carry this release. Only select Best Buy locations have this DVD. When Rocko's Modern Life, Season 1 was released, i was able to purchase it at Best Buy, so i was disappointed slightly...I was starting to lose hope that i would be able to purchase this DVD without having to buy it online. However, i was lucky to find one copy of Aaahh!!! Real Monsters DVD at F.Y.E this morning of the release. It was priced at $17.99, which is the highest price i have seen for the DVD, but regardless, it was worth the money! The person who worked the cash register didn't even know that the show was released on DVD and he worked there. lol. He said how much he loved the show growing up & how it was a great childhood memory, like all of us who grew up on 90's Nick, we have this nostalgic feeling of the 90's, which now we all miss. He went on to say how it made his day and that he was going to go watch it as soon as he get home. lol. It's always good to see another 90's fan like myself.

The shows quality and picture is great on the DVD, and is more amazing then i remembered. I wish there were special features, but it's all good! They show the introduction of the series in all the episodes, but i'm okay with this because the intro is not the same because they do switch up what the Groble says...but the intro might bother others to hear after every episodes though. But i would suggest this DVD and Rocko's Modern Life DVD to anyone who grew up on 90's Nickelodeon.

I wish they would had re-did the cover for the release because it was same art cover as the burn-on-demand discs that Amazon was selling too, which is not worth the money and were overly priced at that. Glad i waited for this DVD release. Now let's just hope they release the other 3 seasons of the show and Rocko's Modern Life, so i can complete my collection. Now if i can just get a DVD release for Doug & Rugrats too, then i will be set.",1317686400,4,2700,4.249027237354086

4647602,4,B005BUA1E4,"What a great show from Nickelodeon this was, from Nick's own golden era of shows like Doug, Rocko's Modern Life and Pete & Pete among others comes another long awaited gem of a show. The cartoon debuted in 1994 and lasted 4 seasons containing 52 episodes in total.

The premise is the young monsters are in school learning how to scare humans, many times through out the show they venture up from under the dump where they go to school to visit humans and scare them. Lots of hi-jinks and personality can be found in these monsters, fun for all ages! There were many monsters with zany characteristics but the 3 main ones most would remember are Ickis who is located on bottom right of the dvd package art, he could grow large to scare humans, then you had Krumm on the left bottom who carried his eyeballs in his hands or even in his mouth at times and his specialty was using his foul armpit stench to scare which was quite comical. Then we have Oblina a female monster who could pull out her internal organs, transform herself and was one of the best students in the school. They sure don't make many cartoons like this nowdays!

Pros: We finally get to see Aaaah! Real Monsters on DVD and get a full season set and on proper DVD-9s discs and not those MOD burned style discs.

  The price is much better then the Amazon Burn on Demand sets were,

Cons: No extras to be heard of. The picture looks good but doesn't pop so I am not sure if much remastering was done here.

But i hope this isn't one of those dvds where they only release one season and not the rest like they did to ""Malcolm in the Middle"" and ""King of the Hill"".  I hope they continue to release the dvds for this show and all the other classic '90s nick shows.",1314748800,2,349,3.887323943661972

4647607,4,B005BUA1E4,"I was very excited to recieve this DVD set, it shipped when it was estimated, and when i opened the box the 3rd disc was out of its holder. As i played disc one everything was running as expected until the end of the credits came. After the klasky csupo logo ended the nickelodeon logo should have shown up, but it was just a blank screen instead. Great show, but a bit more care with the product would be appreciated.",1292544000,,418,4.2375
4647608,5,B005BUA1E4,"I loved the 'old' Nickelodeon shows ans as soon as I saw that Amazon sold them I bought them all up.
My husband and I have actually enjoyed watching them.
I nanny for a family with a 9 year old and a 7 year old, one day I brought the DVD's AHH! Real Monsters and Rugrats. THEY LOVED THEM!
They have watched all thier own movies and had become bored with televition. They complain that T.V. only plays the same shows and ""There's nothing on!"", but when I put in Ahh! Real monsters they sat still and watched episode after episode. They ask me everyday now if I've brought 'my' DVD's. Now we're waiting for Amazon to start selling more seasons of our favorite shows.

The DVD's are in a plain black case with two dvd's inside. The dvd's have graphics on them and look very professional. Each dvd has the 'intro' theme on only the first episode, but at least it's on each dvd.",1292457600,,873,4.290909090909091
4647609,3,B005BUA1E4,"Everything Amy C. Rogers says in the below review is accurate.  I don't really like how they only show the opening once at the beginning of each disc (kind of takes away from the experience, in my opinion) but some people might like that.

My biggest issues, and why I gave it only three stars, was because I was not pleased with Amazon's service.  I originally ordered this DVD on October 1st, anticipating it would arrive well before Halloween.  I received an e-mail on October 13th that it had taken longer than intended to ship, but the DVD was finally on its way and I should be receiving a shipment notification within the next business day.  I didn't.  I had had nothing but good experiences with Amazon up to this point, so I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.

I finally called on October 26th asking about the order.  I was told that they would reship me a new copy with one-day shipping and I should definitely receive it the following day.  I didn't.  I finally received it this Monday, November 1st, one month after I had ordered it and far too late to watch on Halloween night.

As far as the actual product goes, as I said before, everything in the below review is accurate, which is great, but there were a couple things that I thought could be improved upon.  First, the DVD case is difficult to open and difficult to close--very shoddily made.  When I finally did get it open, the 3rd disc in the package was not in place correctly and came flying up and out at my face.  Not pleasant.

When I actually got to watch the DVDs, all this trouble seemed to not matter anymore.  But then I got to disc 3, the one that had not been properly packaged.  It's scratched and does not work.

All in all, it was a good idea, but poorly executed in my case.  I hope no one has the same experience I did with this.  I'm debating contacting Amazon about replacing the 3rd disc, but I might not get that until next Halloween and I'm still too frustrated to even think about it right now.",1288742400,2,2001,4.342318059299191
8464270,5,B005BUA1E4,"This season of Aaahh! Real Monsters was really fun to watch. There's a great Halloween episode called, The Switching Hour.
