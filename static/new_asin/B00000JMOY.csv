7912683,5,B00000JMOY,"Loved it in the small Chinese theater and owning it (until my housemate left with all DVDs).  Will hold your attention and emotions from beginning to end. My favorite haunting musical theme ""Sukiyaki"" repeats, as do story themes revisited and expanded. All thumbs up!",1405987200,,267,5.068181818181818
7912684,5,B00000JMOY,"First of all, the packaging was excellent and to the movie, this is a great movie that pretty much covers everything, from drama, action, to a little life lessons learned...Great stuff!",1344556800,,185,5.0
7912685,5,B00000JMOY,"This was the 10th Jonny To film I've seen and while I wouldn't argue that it's his best, it is definitely his most entertaining!  There are three classic scenes in the first fifteen minutes and several throughout the film.  If you're a fan of Jonny To--or Hong Kong cinema or well-crafted, slick, cool, emotionally charged actual flicks--then this film is a MUST!",1227225600,,363,4.838709677419355
7912686,5,B00000JMOY,"A Hero Never Dies is a hardcore, gritty, and just plain ass-kicking film.  I was already a big Lau Ching Wan fan but after seeing this, Leon Lai is no punk either.  Martin (Lau) and Jack (Lai) are top-notch killers who admire each other but work for opposing triads.  After a bloody shoot-out, Martin is crippled and Jack is wounded.  Jack's boss even sends assasins after him in the hospital.  His girlfriend (Yoyo Mung) saves his life but is horribly burned as a result.  The triad leaders join forces and forget about our heroes.  Martin's girlfriend (Fiona Leung) is murdered by his former boss and revenge is the only option.  Jack decides to team up with Martin and a new war begins.  This is another great product from director Johnnie To and the Milky Way Image team.  If you liked The Longest Nite and Expect The Unexpected, this is right up your alley.",1136937600,2,862,4.57516339869281
7912687,4,B00000JMOY,"This movie is a stylized version of *A Better Tomorrow*.
Leon Lai and Lau ChingWan are the 2 ace hitman in the middle of the gangwar. Tho they work for different bosses, they develop a strange friendship. Sadly, they expect one to die by the other's hand. And the opportunity comes up, as they get a lil *competiion* at Malaysia. But their bosses join force, to leave them dead. It's only through each killer's sense of honor and perseverance that payback can be done.
Once again, Lau Ching Wan turns in a fine performance. Charismatic and layered performance. Leon Lai is pretty good as Jack.",1028937600,3,593,4.6571428571428575
7912688,5,B00000JMOY,"From great Director Johnny To, 'A Hero Never Dies' is quiet simply a heart pounding battle of guts; heroism; friendship; love; and revenge. This is simply one of the best films made ever in the history of Hong Kong Cinema and is rivaled only by 'The Killer';'The Longest Nite';'Hard Boiled';and 'Full Contact', it is one of the best films of it's genre and is widely considered a fantastic film for it's performances by Lau Ching Wan and Leon Lai, as well as the superior direction of Johnny To.
'A Hero Never Dies' is a must for people that enjoyed any of the mentioned films and, like the Longest Nite, it is definetly not for people with out a mind. The film is involveing, emotional, and creative.",1010966400,3,701,4.571428571428571
7912689,3,B00000JMOY,"johnny To used to be a master of melodrama, partly due to his training from the tv soap opera...but since this very film, he changed into a serious filmmaker with a thorough look at the person ""hero"", in  terms of both human nature and the burden which were set on them by the  world. I think To was greatly influnced by his writer-partner Wai Ka Fai on  this issue. Looking foward to seeing his latest ""Running Out of  Time"" and ""Mission"".",956448000,,440,4.395061728395062
