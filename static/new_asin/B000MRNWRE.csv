8171618,2,B000MRNWRE,"I am Jewish and I am always on the hunt for Jewish film/TV with positive messages. I was super excited to get this DVD. However, the production of this movie was not great. The stories are done in small skits and the premises behind them are by doing good for others good things will come back to you. The skits are very short and not as uplifting as you may like. The production is poorly filmed as if it were filmed in people's homes. The actors must be local community because none were great actors.

The Story of the couple from the Holocaust is amazing and the best story.",1497139200,,578,4.302752293577981
