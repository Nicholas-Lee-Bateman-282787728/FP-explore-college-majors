3966121,1,B002Q03LCQ,"Wow this movie is crap Brett Moses must be the worst writer, actor, director since Ed Wood, this movie is horrid there are about a hundred unnecessary camera shots that serve only one purpose showing Brett Moses with yet another slow motion country dumb look on his face. Notice all the reviews are by other people that know this guy or where extras or attached to this movie, as a person with no connection to this steaming hot pile of a movie I would recommend not buying it, not even watching it swag online",1266537600,2,510,4.4361702127659575
3966122,5,B002Q03LCQ,My favorite part of the movie is at the first during the true red-neck drinking and chasing scene with Bo Bice growling the Old Spanish Trail!,1266105600,2,142,4.5
3966123,5,B002Q03LCQ,"Good movie about small town boys who have to man-up fast after taking some risky big city chances that have ultimate consequences.  Folks from Beaumont, Sour Lake and other communities from Southeast Texas might recognize some background scenes.",1265155200,2,245,5.447368421052632
3966124,5,B002Q03LCQ,"Great Job Brett loved the movie. It was cool seeing a bunch of guys from school all in a movie at the same time.
Good Luck and hope you get to make another one.",1264809600,2,160,3.735294117647059
3966125,5,B002Q03LCQ,After watching this movie you get that old fashion feeling of movies the way they were.  Great job for a new upcoming star - Brett Moses!,1263427200,2,137,4.269230769230769
3966126,5,B002Q03LCQ,"This movie tells a wonderful story, family, friends and doing the right thing. It isn't just a chick flick both like it you left the movie with a warm heart. All ages will like this film.",1259712000,7,187,4.222222222222222
3966131,4,B002Q03LCQ,"Real life situations blown up, realistically, to a level that makes a great story.  Gives pause to thought after the show is over.  I like films that are not stereotypical environments/settings but are captivating.  This filled the bill for me.  I only gave 4 stars because I was legitimately sad at the end of the movie.  That is the story, but I prefer to not be sad at the end.  Not a flaw of the movie, just personal taste.",1425081600,,427,4.341772151898734
3966132,5,B002Q03LCQ,This movie is one movie that kept me very interested.  It was good.  Wes Brown was not afraid to flex his muscles and attitude.  He was great and so was the movie. Fans should watch this movie and support the actors.,1424563200,,216,4.219512195121951
3966133,4,B002Q03LCQ,Very defined characters makes this intriguing to watch.,1424390400,,55,6.0
3966134,1,B002Q03LCQ,"The fight scenes were too long.  Everyones a drunk. People fight for no reason. People with lung cancer and their families smoke. The characters were not likable. Too much time spent with the truck driver and crazy guy. The ex-girlfriend and her son being taken away that was left hanging.  Too many guys saying I love you to each other. Main character said yes sir about 500 times. I think he said it to the female acting sheriff.  The final scene was not plausible.  Why would the protagonist pull a gun on the sheriff for the reason he did?  I could see if that fat guy that got bullied did it. That would make more sense. Like a hostage scene at the bar. Do these jeans make me look fat? Tell me I look skinny in these jeans or I'll kill all y'all. That would have worked better. And then maybe they could have like Richard Simmons come in as one of those police negotiators. Put down the gun. I'm going to count to ten... one, two, three... and four, that's good, and five, uh huh, lookin' good...five more... you go girl...    And who is Brock Goodwin? I don't think that's his real name. I think he changed it from Milton Dagmire Quigley or some other dumb name. Brock Goodwin. Now there's a country sounding name... Hi y'all. How all y'all doin' tonight? I'm Brock Goodwin from Gooberville, Arkansas and I'm gonna sing a little song I wrote on I-95 called... well... ""Song I Wrote on I-95"".  It goes somethin' like this... ""Drove my truck down I-95. Wrote this here song, or at least I done tried...""
Okay, I didn't like the movie if you didn't guess.",1419033600,2,1559,4.40418118466899
3966135,5,B002Q03LCQ,"Lot's of films on Amazon have been rated highly, but I have found very few of those films worth watching. This one surprised me and I am glad I viewed it. This was well written, well directed, well acted. The only  ""predictable"" aspect of this material was the hell-raising-good-ol'-boys-just-havin'-a-good-time, which always ends up with a fight, takin'-it outside-followed-by-a-crowd-and-the-gals crying-for-their-men. But, know what? That really does happen and predictable as it is, it is credible. No wasted words in the dialogues, either. Makes you think. Going to look up the story on-line. I would watch this one again.",1418083200,3,627,5.463917525773196
3966136,1,B002Q03LCQ,We kept waiting for it to get better.  So unrealistic and a waste of time.  I really don't understand how it was rated as a four star movie.,1417392000,,140,3.9642857142857144
3966137,5,B002Q03LCQ,I thought this was a very good movie. Very touching on how family will do things to help other family,1408838400,,101,4.1
3966138,4,B002Q03LCQ,kind of predictable but great wholesome viewing.  I hate smut....this was a good movie for me. Enjoyed the story very much.,1403481600,,123,4.857142857142857
3966139,1,B002Q03LCQ,"Very cheesy, predictable, weak plot develpment, flat characters, moves slow.  Some good music.  Don't waste your time on this one.",1401753600,,130,5.45
3966140,5,B002Q03LCQ,One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. This was exactly my kind of movie. I was very pleased,1397088000,,104,3.5652173913043477
3966151,3,B002Q03LCQ,"The acting was fairly good.
Story was fairly interesting though not above a Lifetime movie.
Actors were not caricatures,  though lacking in some nuance.",1394582400,,152,5.333333333333333
3966152,4,B002Q03LCQ,Love Lee Ann Womack....nuff said.,1389139200,,33,5.8
3966153,4,B002Q03LCQ,This was ok movie it was little rough for me but I think some would like it .Main got it because Michel Parks was in it .,1358380800,,121,3.5185185185185186
3966154,5,B002Q03LCQ,"know some of the extra in this movie.  it told a great story about life, family, love, friendship & happiness",1357430400,,109,4.45
3966155,5,B002Q03LCQ,"This is a good movie. I got it mostly because my Favorite Country Singer, Lee Ann Womack stars in it. I enjoyed it very much not just to see her but the other stars as well.  I think anybody would enjoy this movie.",1349913600,,214,3.9767441860465116
3966156,5,B002Q03LCQ,"It seems Mr Byrd is taking time off since 2007 to help his family grow up
2 boys and a girl
he says he is not going to record till his kids are grown up
so goes life and sensebleness
chfancier
fancier of fine movies",1348790400,,215,3.8
3966157,2,B002Q03LCQ,"I was very disappointed with this DVD, finding the whole thing amaturish with poor sound and visual.
To tell the truth, the only reason I ordered it was to see Tracy Byrd - good thing I didn't blink or
I would have missed him.
However- it was priced right and delivered quicker than I expected.
What ever happened to Tracy Byrd - love his songs and voice.  Does anyone have
any news of him?",1317081600,,390,4.27027027027027
3966158,5,B002Q03LCQ,"Our daughter was very excited to receive this DVD....
She had been trying to locate it forever & could not. Amazon had it & we bought it for Christmas 2010. She squealed and took a pic of it even lol. Great movie that stars her favorite country music singer LeAnne Womack...
She said the movie was really good (coming from a 16 year old) her grandmother liked it too (69 yrs)
Thanks Amazon!",1294963200,2,390,4.3561643835616435
3966159,4,B002Q03LCQ,"The video story line is so-so, but the soundtrack amazing! Some great country artists both old and new. Good to hear Tracy Byrd again and Bo Bice rocks it out on Old Spanish Trail. The music is what really drew me to this video.  I'll watch it again, and again.",1282953600,2,261,4.22
3966160,2,B002Q03LCQ,"Brett Moses wrote, produced, directed, and starred in this film; which seems to be about a bunch of really silly people with no ""acting for the camera skills"", who hang out in a honky-tonk bar in Jefferson County, Texas. To his ""credit"", Moses soft peddles his starring role and lists Michael ""Bronson"" Parks, Lee Ann Womack, Ryan Hurst, and Dominique Swain ahead of him on the promotional material; despite the fact that he is in every single scene and only Womack has a substantial part in the production.

This is the sort of production where you can almost pick out the point where the crew finally flipped and realized it was a train wreck in the making. Then they begin secretly laughing at the writer and director, who in this case is the same poor guy. To their credit, the crew still managed to maintain their professionalism throughout the production and should get high marks for their hard work, which must have seemed like a huge waste to them. But it is one of those sow's ears to silk purse things where you just can't do much with such a hopeless script.

This over-wrought melodrama has something to say but doesn't do a very good (or entertaining) job of saying it. It might have worked as a Texas style parody of a Tennessee Williams play but I think the comedy is entirely unintentional.

Potential viewers would be wise to disregard the favorable comments about the movie which seem to have been posted by people associated with the production who have commented only about ""Noble Things"".

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1281830400,2,1558,4.650909090909091

8377381,5,B002Q03LCQ,"Just turning the dial on the TV and movie was just starting - when I saw the name MICHAEL PARKS
it didn't matter who else was in it!  Great movie - Michael always the BEST - miss not hearing him
sing.",1443830400,,200,3.8780487804878048

8377385,2,B002Q03LCQ,"Meh, super slow.  Not all that interesting.  Ending was pretty lame.  It really didn't deserve 2 stars - more like 1.5.  But I couldn't give it one star because I save those reviews for movies like ""Dude, Where is My Car""  - if you are super bored and have nothing to watch, then put this at the bottom of your list.",1425945600,,316,4.114754098360656
