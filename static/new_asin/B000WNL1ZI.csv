8475502,1,B000WNL1ZI,"This DVD is absolutely horrible.  The production quality is terrible and the narration is practically incomprehensible.

It looks as if someone ran around on a cloudy day with a hand-held camcorder and shot vacation-quality videos.  Finally, the colors are completely washed out, and most of the shots are taken on cloudy days, and this choice of weather exacerbates the inherent poor production quality.

FYI - I returned the DVD to Amazon for a full refund.

Please try these Amazon DVDs on India instead:
