5372181,5,B009XZG9LM,"I watched some of this excellent series on and off when it came on the History channel back in 2006-2007, but was never able to watch most of the episodes, and now I have found out that there were many more seasons than 06-07. I even recognized one of the people in this series, namely Dana MacKenzie, author of ""the big splat"" who I happened to see at my chess club (a fairly good chess player at that) here in Columbus, Ohio back in the late 1980's or early 1990's (can't remember exactly when).

  After watching the whole 4 seasons included in this particular set I can conclude that this is ""one of the best bargains in the universe"" at the price I paid for it. (less than 30 greenbacks when you include shipping charges).",1426636800,,727,4.37037037037037

8545163,5,B009XZG9LM,"I love The Universe. You can tell in season one that they were just beginning. But then their momentum builds. My favorite is in season 4, The Pulsars and Quasars. The best is you don't have to sit through commercials.",1465257600,,218,4.475

8545168,2,B009XZG9LM,"My recollection of this series first coming out was better in the past. I've come to find that this series isn't really a series of facts. All it is, is a bunch of educated guessing, and furthermore, what you didn't expect: a bunch of non-educated fear-mongering. I swear, every show has an out-there theory: ""What if the moon gets hit by an asteroid and hurls through space and wipes out a planet earth by first landing on an orphanage of innocent children?""

I kid you not, for whatever sick, demented reason, every show's punchline happens to be a ""what-if"" theory that planet earth is threatened? These are all way-out-there speculations that have so many factors to make the usually twisted scenario even half-way possible. Some of the shows go the whole way and tell you what they are, there are a few shows about possible apocalyptic occurrences. But when I'm watching a show about supposedly the moon, or the sun, and the show's punchline is about the people of earth dying because we didn't hug enough trees or look at the stars enough, this isn't a show about facts and the universe anymore. If this is what astrologers and scientists sit around and think about, I grieve over their families, if they have them.

Do yourself a favor, buy a telescope, or maybe a picture-book with a few anecdotes of what scientists DO know, don't waste your time on fear-mongering, sad, depressed scientists, and movie-makers that use both educated and very uneducated guesses about what they haven't figured out yet. Just like Americans to pretend they know when they really don't because, believe it or not, we don't have the ability to, yet.",1444176000,,1637,4.780918727915195

8545171,4,B009XZG9LM,Very interesting series but sound quality problems on the second disc of the season one set is disappointing.  Very hard to listen to as it is so distorted.  I would have given it five stars if not for this problem.,1440460800,,215,4.35
8545172,5,B009XZG9LM,Bought all the series for my husbands birthday.  He loves them!,1440201600,,63,4.7272727272727275
