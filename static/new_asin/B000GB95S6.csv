8130269,5,B000GB95S6,"Maximum Breakout is glorious bad movie. If you think that there will be any kind of prison breakouts with a name like Maximum Breakout, you're wrong. This movie really explores the meaning of breakouts. It's got one seriously creepy plot but don't worry it's ready to explore it in many of the same ways as it does breakouts.

Basic plot, a couple go out for a drive and the gal pal is kidnapped. 9 months later, the hero finally gets a band of weirdos with mullets, mustaches and questionable clothing choices together to get her back. They also meet a speech impaired cowboy who rides a horse around in the city who tags along cause he probably was an investor on the movie. I'm trying not to spoil anything. One of the best things about this movie is that it's not made by the thought processes of a normal person. It's done by essentially a crazy person. A fun crazy person at least or one that's just getting it all out on screen. Either way it's hilarious.

Sadly, after looking on IMDB, it turns out there were a lot of people who simply didn't go on working after this. If they did, there was a lot of Skinemax work in their future. It's really pretty funny cause they all pretty much have zero sexual chemistry on screen with anyone. So this movie just keeps on giving.",1520899200,,1278,4.411016949152542

8130271,3,B000GB95S6,"In MAXIMUM BREAKOUT (1991), Travis (Bobby Johnston) and Bobbi (Sydney Coale) are driving along, minding their own business, when they are attacked by thugs, led by a man w/ a heinous ponytail and wearing a long black coat. Travis is knocked out, while Bobbi is drugged and abducted. Travis regains consciousness, and screams for Bobby: ""Bobbbbbyyyyy!"". He looks a lot like a 1970's Robert Plant merged w/ Dave Mustaine, w/ a tomato squashed on his forehead. ""BBobbbyyyy!"", he wails! Oh no! Bobbi awakens in a prison-like facility, where we witness a man preparing her breakfast, in much the same way as a go-rilla, impersonating Martha Stewart, would fix an omelette! Bobbi knows she's in big trouble, especially when she looks out her window to see, what appears to be the world's largest hillbilly! With a shootin' iron! ""Ohhh, Trrravvviss!"", she blubbers! Six months pass, and Travis Plant-Mustaine, while loitering in front of SLIM'S GUN SHOP, joins up w/ the enormous-haired, tough-talking, chain-smoking, Debbie (Carrie Murray). They are soon joined by a man who resembles every heavy metal guitar player to ever appear on MTV in the 80's! His name is Reb. In no time flat, Travis and Reb are surrounded by one of the gangs from Michael Jackson's BEAT IT video! Their leader, named Loch, likes to laugh and fire guns into the air. Enter Suicide McVie, a cray-zee stunt man who is the spitting image of Schneider the handyman from ONE DAY AT A TIME. He even acts like him! Next, the posse employs the expertise of ""the professor"", a computer geek / explosives expert. He's almost as exciting as a nasally-challenged loaf of bread. A side story ensues, concerning Bobbi's snobby parents, while Bobbi rots in captivity. Their strike-team assembled, our heroes -finally- set out to rescue Bobbi, who could be a mummy by now! This B-team even takes time out to boogie down -guns in hands- at a frat party! We're even treated to a dull, soap opera, flashback-montage of Travis and Bobbi in better days, complete w/ wretched, finger-down-the-throat theme music! Sheesh! More precious time elapses. Bobbi who? Anyway, they're going to have to be careful, since ponytail man is far more than the lifeless, male model he seems to be! Yep, he and his cronies run an adoption agency! Poor Bobbi is just one among a gaggle of impregnated prisoners! After what feels like centuries, Travis and company find out where Bobbi is being kept. It's a good thing, since most of the movie has slipped away! Isn't this supposed to be an ""action"" movie? And what's up w/ the cowboy riding around? And why would any criminal mastermind, pony-tailed or not, hire brain-bereft hillbillies? At long last, our heroes are on their way to Bobbi's location, at ""the ranch of terrible actors""! No, really, these people are as natural as Naugahyde! By the time Travis and his pals arrive -w/ the damned cowboy- the movie's almost over! So, are the final fifteen minutes worth the eternal wait? Welllll, not so much. Still, this mess is just absurd enough to induce some much needed laughter. EXHIBIT A- The pregnant hostages, having already experienced untold trauma, are now subject to explosions, automatic weapons, and a nice, bouncy ride in the bed of a pickup truck during their rescue! EXHIBIT B- The baby / doll in a blanket is ""rescued"", and carried like a bundle of firewood, and handed off like a football, to the cowboy! I rest my case!... P.S.- Perhaps, MINIMUM BREAKOUT would have been a more appropriate title...",1510963200,3,3498,4.890572390572391
8130272,2,B000GB95S6,A decent B action movie with some good moments and but other than a friends in low places vibe. The movie overall very run mill revenge action flick.,1408752000,,149,4.357142857142857
