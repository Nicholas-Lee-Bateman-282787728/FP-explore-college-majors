2933945,5,B000V8Q3KC,"I got this DVD for my 71 year old mother.  She suffers from low blood pressure, which can make her dizzy, so she thought exercising was out of the question.  Not so with this DVD!

Focusing on a fairly good workout for a seated position, everything is explained well, at a nice pace, and in a pleasant manner.  I highly recommend this for seniors, or anyone who has mobility problems who is looking to stay in shape.",1300320000,12,416,4.363636363636363
2933946,5,B000V8Q3KC,This is easy and helpful for anyone who needs rehab or anyone having trouble getting around. It gets the blood flowing better and the lungs working a little extra. Wilson is great with people. She really has a heart for helping. The music fits each segment and helps the brain to switch gears. Nice for all ages.,1299196800,9,312,4.491228070175438

8217235,5,B000V8Q3KC,"As an arthritic senior on oxygen, I was delighted to discover the TV show with exercises just right for me.  I ordered this so I could do the exercises on days the TV show wasn't on  The pace is just right and I feel like Mary Ann is a friend who understands what I can and cannot do.  I like the approach of not doing it til it hurts, but stopping if there is pain or discomfort.  There is a lot of stretching and expansion of the chest and lung area, which is really helpful to my breathing.  I am so glad I got this.",1378425600,,519,3.9047619047619047

8217237,3,B000V8Q3KC,"Liked the exercises, of course, but they are the exact exercises in another dvd we purchased sometime ago.
Therefore, we did not get new exercises and feel that we paid for a repeat of what we had already paid for.
We would like some new moves rather than repeating the same moves over and over.",1354665600,,295,4.381818181818182
