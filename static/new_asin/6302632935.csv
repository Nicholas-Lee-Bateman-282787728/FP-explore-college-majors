What I remember is that it has great music, an original score by the now legendary Antonio Carlos Jobim.  Worth seeing for that reason alone - wish I could get a soundtrack CD.

488716,2,6302632935,"I'll defer to Leonard Maltin who calls it a three-hour challenge to the kidneys.  He exaggerates; it's only 177 minutes long.  The obvious intent was to make another ""Bigger than Ben Hur"" but even with magastars such as Charlie Assover, Canned Ice and McHale, it doesn't gel.  The Colombian government kindly rented their zocalo in Bogota, the nation's largest plaza, to the film crew.  Also lots of blood and sex if you're interested.

488717,3,6302632935,"I saw this film on first run after reading the novel by Harold Robbins. I was afraid  now I would be disappointed in the production, but was pleasantly surprised to see that this deserves to be a high rated guilty pleasure for me. If this falls down it is not the fault of the cast or crew, but of the story supplied by Harold Robbins, and that is purely a matter of personal taste . I agree with the reviewer who said that this film is better than other Robbins adaptions including The Carpetbaggers. The direction is excellent as is the editing, art direction and photography. The cast is entirely competent and the dialogue is actually clever, sparkling occasionally, and well above-average. Star Behkim Fehmiu was certainly an unknown yet does a solid job being a man whose emotions were largely destroyed by a childhood trauma. You might compare this bad boy hero to James Bond or even Mr. Darcy  in terms of his stone-faced implacability. The novel and the film are long, but the story demands it. The film's tagline is 'Nothing has been left out of The Adventurers,' and that seems to be the effort here,  approaching three hours with an intermission. In all, the film is probably much better than you've been told it is, with plenty of action and violence, and a bit of 70's sex, mixing with human stories -- and worth watching.  I certainly liked it better than Lewis Gilbert's directing effort You Only Live Twice. This is not a forgettable movie in film historical terms or in terms of overall production quality.  If this is your genre,  you could do much worse.",1462492800,3,1574,4.623655913978495

488726,4,6302632935,"So here we have the much maligned and abused film 'The Adventurers' which makes many Top Ten lists as one of the worst movies ever made.  Here I will give the only Spoiler Alert I can make about this movie:  yes, it is bad.  Like, really bad.  With that being said, however, I found this movie to be nearly hypnotic in its awfulness.  You can almost bathe in it.  You can't even make the argument of 'it's-so-bad-it's-good' because it is truly bad.  There is much ado about the acting (or lack thereof) of the lead star, Bekim Fehmiu, but if you look at what atrocities they put him through in the first ten minutes or so I am amazed that he can even function as an adult and almost forgive him for being an emotional invalid.  My top three reactions to this movie were: ""Well, this is something that is happening"", ""Why not!"" and ""How did they drag poor Olivia DeHavilland into this?"".  The very lovely Candice Bergen is pretty much wasted in this, but when you see her 'orgasm-face' you start to think that it's probably not a bad thing.  The movie is actually quite stunning to look at even though everything else around it is a total mess.  The fact that the movie is SUCH a complete mess is what makes it so compulsively watchable and I mean that in the most non-ironic way possible.",1441065600,,1288,4.3924050632911396
488737,5,6302632935,"Although this is an average movie, it brought back sweet memories of the 70s. When thing were so cool and slow.

488741,5,6302632935,"I saw this movie in 1970, when I was 20, and it profoundly moved me, affecting me from that time onwards, as it apparently has many other viewers. I think that it's a very great movie. Having spent the majority of my life trying to make this world a better place, I find now, at age 65,  that -as I feared- I will probably end up like Dax myself. The local municipal tyrants that I've worked to overthrow time-after-time, here in the U.S., just keep getting replaced with young Turks that soon become corrupt themselves. So, I think that this movie should be appreciated for what it is, a great morality play. At least, that's the movie that I saw 45 years ago, as an idealistic 20 year old. It moved me then, and it still does today.",1426723200,,734,4.318840579710145

488759,4,6302632935,"I like this flawed film as a guilty pleasure. From the bad title sequence to the misuse of great Jobin music...(did they just add songs from a record with no idea of working the music into the story?) to the great cast cut down by the inept directing to the editing that seems to have left out some crucial elements, this still could have been a good film.

The actors and actresses are doing a good job (aside for a few scenery-chewing scenes) in what sometimes appears to be a supremely extravagantly funded student film. The sets are great. The camera work and lighting is classic Hollywood. The basic script is even quite good. BUT. The sexual encounters are especially cringe-worthy and not to be missed. The war sequences are just strange on many levels and the ending...whomever decided that was a great idea should have been shot. You just have to have that unintentional laugh.

Yet, as I look at it, I cannot help but think if someone could get their hands on the original footage, this could still be saved and edited into a iconic-good and not ironic-odd film.",1386374400,,1072,4.607329842931938
488760,5,6302632935,"I saw this movie when I was very little.  The part of where they say ""I'll take you over the Mountain"", seems to hearkens back to Thomas Jonathan ""Stonewall"" Jackson when he died and said ""Let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of the trees.""  It is the interplay between Ernest Borgnine and Dax (Diogenes Alejandro Xenos)  the lends so much to this movie.  If you dont' like European 70's movies then you might not get much from this movie, but if you enjoy the duplicity of power politics and Borgnine this is a must see movie.",1382572800,2,543,4.346534653465347

The film makes some changes to the book, more time spent in Corteguay and more battle scenes. These are the strongest element of the film and give it some form of epic grandeur which the Rome sequences do not always offer. What the film gains from being shot in Columbia it sometimes loses in Italy. The film has many delights - Miss Moneypenny at a fashion show, the strange death of Dax's baby, that fashion show in New York (truly a marvel of sixties fashion/music/direction). The acting is decidedly up-and-down and the production design can be sometimes real and sometimes unreal (Charles Aznavour's secret place for one, rub your eyes in disbelief at that one).

Of course it is too long and sometimes too much of 1969. The characters engage and repel and the actors are a mixed bunch. But...you should see this one if only for how cinema was. Mad and bad and just a little bit more charismatic than it is now.",1374364800,2,1121,4.544554455445544

488788,4,6302632935,"This movie came out in 1970 and I enjoyed it greatly as a college freshman. It was a very revealing hot film even if it was not a financial or critical success.  I decided to take a second look after 40 years and despite the criticism, the film really is good entertainment.  It is an extremely ambitious film, full of characters, and full of European jet set dynamics and South American politics.  The cast is very good with Candice Bergin demonstrating her considerable abilities early in her film making career. The depiction of the sexual appetites of the international jet set was ahead of its time.  This is also one of those rare films where the film is much better than the book. Harold Robbins wrote the Adventurers based on the life story of a polo playing playboy, Porfirio Rubirosa, from the Dominican Republic who marries heiress Barbara Hutton and then later Za Za Gabor.  The film captures the foreign intrigue and double dealing and the drugs and alcohol and parties of the beautiful people. Dax Xenos, the main character, based on Rubirosa, undergoes many traumas as a child which retards his emotional ability to love but certainly does not retard his ability to seduce and marry wealthy women. Dax gathers considerable wealth, slowly matures and becomes a responsible adult, which is a primary theme of the film. However the corruption of power, especially evident in South American politics, is also the context in which Dax lives and which he eventually gains the maturity to try to impact for the better. So we see a child, traumatized by violence and the murder of his mother and sister, become an international playboy seducing every attractive and wealthy woman he meets, only to finally be confronted with his personal power to impact injustice and maybe correct some of the wrongs he himself has committed through omission and commission. The film is highly entertaining.",1267228800,2,1898,4.900311526479751

One line at the end of the movie said it all, ""Corteguay will always belong to the revolution"". It was sad after all the fighting and dying the only thing acomplished was killing one tyrant and putting another in his place.",1243987200,,494,4.428571428571429

Real locations...Columbia, Rome, New York. Lotsa good actors. Even the unknown lead does a good job. Some, for the time, over the top sex and violence. The soundtrack was a real find: Antonio Carlos Jobin and Deodato. Two first class Brazilian composer's at the top of their game. The story is basically exploitive trash...but it is presented in such a most professional and engaging way that you can't help but be sucked in.

488795,4,6302632935,"My vague memory of THE ADVENTURERS was that it was a campily bad studio flick--one I'd never bothered to see when it came out in 1970.  Nearly 40 years later, it turns out to be extremely entertaining as a DVD experience.  On the big screen during the era of EASY RIDER and M*A*S*H, it's easy to see that this would be considered an overproduced, overblown bore.  But with a pre-CGI cast of thousands and extravagant sets, it's now truly impressive.

I haven't been a reader of Harold Robbins, but this film explains his popularity.  The fantasy elegance of the rich and ambitious is tremendous fun, and he crams more plot into his story that a whole shelf of Galsworthy.  Except for a 4-yr-old in the second part of the movie (yes, there's actually an intermission!), even the kid actors are good in their roles.

I'd expected VALLEY OF THE DOLLS and instead found the epic sweep and sturdy dialogue of the Taylor-Burton CLEOPATRA.  True, a number of the sex scenes look like PLAYBOY (not PENTHOUSE) layouts from the '60s (James Bondy but even more lavish), and a couple of daringly camp touches after the intermission are a hoot:  a VALLEY OF THE DOLLS fashion show, and an UNDER THE YUM YUM TREE lothario's lair.

All in all, however, this DVD is a good investment and, of course, after large portions of such rich scenes and scenery, one can turn off the DVD for a while to recupe before plunging again into its fabulous excess!",1178928000,7,1432,4.602362204724409

Sorry that the original soundtrack album is a long time out-of-print item, a big object of desire though part of it has been re-recorded in Mr. Jobim's album 'Stone Flower' for CTi Records, available here @Amazon.

It is also interesting to watch singer and composer Charles Aznavour acting as an actor. It is also good to see beautiful actress Candice Bergen in action.

488800,4,6302632935,"Taking a look at the DVD case for this, you read a whole different text than what this movie actually is.  The DVD case presents a movie that is a romantic action adventure, a children's movie (rated PG) or at least family movie about a hero who gets the girl and everything turns out all right in the end.

This movie is rated PG.

We open on a boy and his dog, idyllic, playful, nothing to worry about.  The music is friendly, the colors are friendly, the land is friendly, everything is perfect.  Then a gunshot rings out and the dog falls dead.  The boy runs to a villa, where he watches his family get raped and murdered, all very bloody, violent, and horrifying (much like the same type of violence in A Clockwork Orange, actually).

This movie is rated PG.

We follow this boy's journey through life, not as an action adventure, but as an epic... the story of a man who, after the trauma of his family's near complete distruction, is sent away to Rome to escape the made-up South American land of Corteguay, where he transistions between being an adulterist playboy (much like a less liked and less proactive James Bond, which is interesting because the director made Moonraker), to an apathetic, bitter nigh-rapist, to the potential savior of Cortequay who is only used and abused by its leaders until he himself falls victim and nothing changes for the better.

This movie is rated PG.

We follow a whole melange of extra characters as they move through their either abused, poor life without happiness, or their empty, corrupted life as the rich, and how they all intermix and intermingle to create a land, Corteguay, that is constantly at war with itself, and how they all add to it their own violence.

This movie is rated PG.

We follow playboys into S&M dungeons (again, imagery very alike A Clockwork Orange), young boys becoming men by shooting down rows of prisoners with automatic machine guns, women without control of their independence, civil leaders claiming that ""There must be a cohesion of evil and politics,"" revolutionaries who rape, pillage, plunder, and massacre; prostitute nuns, apathetic heroes, unstimulating sex (and lots of it), children getting killed, and the beauty of civilization and nature juxtaposed with explosions and grimacing Gothic architecture, idealistic moments ALWAYS ended suddenly with pronounced, crippling pain.

This movie is rated PG.

I'll go out on a limb here and say that it's probably likely nobody likes this movie.  It's not likeable.  It's well done, but clocking in at just over 3 hours of watching the horrors of humanity being committed again and again while our unsympathetic hero has sex with everything with two legs and makes a living off of it...  Even if it was marketed correctly, it wouldn't be approached correctly.

Good mix of drama, local color, some saucy but dated romantic scenes, plenty of action (plenty of nice vintage WWII armor), backstabbing, shoot 'em ups and Ernest Borgnine as 'Fat Cat' is extra special. Worth watching.",1126483200,,286,4.74
488802,5,6302632935,"Most people who saw this movie did not understand it, and when it was first released in 1970 the sex and violence were so far over the top for the period that most critics couldn't see the top.  The movie, like a lot of the actresses it featured, was topless.  Today it is par for the course.  The gorgeous photography, however, is far better than what one sees in most modern films.

The story is a roman a clef.  The fictional South American country Corteguay is not either of its quasi-namesakes Paraguay or Uruguay but Colombia, where much of the principal photography was done.  Dax Xenos is not really Dax Xenos but Porfirio Rubirosa, who was not from Corteguay or Colombia but the Dominican Republic, which is not a South American country but a Carribean country.  (Harold Robbins admitted this, so there is no doubt.)  Rubirosa was not the playboy son of a diplomat.  He WAS a diplomat, who discovered early on that he could use his diplomatic skills to become a wealthy man by becoming a playboy and marrying wealthy women.  The most engrossing fiction is based loosely on reality.

That said, what makes the movie work is its theme.  In movies, the character who changes is the main character, regardless of what the billing says, and the only character in this movie who changes is Dax.  He starts out a cynical playboy, out to charm his way into the beds and bank accounts of wealthy ladies, and ends up a saint, struggling valiantly to change the world for the better.  Alas, for the world will not change, and protects its scumbag identity by killing the irritating Dax, so things can go on being as corrupt as ever.  The theme is therefore that the world will not change and perhaps even cannot change.  But individuals can.  Whatever his failings in early life, before Dax is murdered he thoroughly redeems himself.  There is hope, the author is saying, for the individual, but not for the larger context in which he lives.  The story therefore combines hard nosed realism with a cautious optimism, and the result will win over the most cynical among us.  I know because ""the most cynical among us"" is the way I would describe myself and the story makes sense to me.

If you understand this, the whole middle of the movie, which follows Dax and his friends as they acquire the wealth and power they need to fulfill their respective destinies, makes sense and is thoroughly enjoyable.  This part of the film is necessary to make sense of the movie's ending, in which Dax confronts the corruption that has plagued his beleaguered homeland.

If there are sex and violence and drugs in the movie that is because there are sex and violence and drugs in the real world in which characters like this live.  As one of the characters in the movie says, his people did not get to where they were by being philanthropists.  He could have added that they did not get to where they were by being burdened with unnecessary impediments like scruples.  Welcome to the world of the upper class.

Oh, yes, and the book is not better than the movie.  The movie in this case is better than the book.  Much better.  The book needed an editor in the worst way.  The movie had one.  It is too long for some tastes, but it works well as home entertainment because you can watch as much as you want in one sitting.  Then come back for more later.  I have probably watched it twenty times.  I will probably watch it twenty more.

The best movie by far made from a Robbins novel, only rivaled by The Betsy.  Highly recommended.",1125446400,31,3516,4.55023923444976
488803,3,6302632935,"For the price this DVD is well worth the effort,great photography and print makes it standout over more recent releases but thats where it ends.  I saw the movie on its initial release all those years ago and quite frankly it remains dreary.  The book was never great,but the movie could have been tighter and pacy with a better script.  A pity though,as it seems wasted in time.  However if you want to wallow away a few hours on a wet Sunday afternoon,this might do the trick",1124150400,,477,4.448275862068965
488804,5,6302632935,"This review is based on the VHS release: ADVENTURERS ranks among the Top 10 ""Very Best of the BERRY Worst"" in my book THE OFFICIAL RAZZIE MOVIE GUIDE (also available from Amazon.com). Based on one of Harold Robbins' trashiest novels, it tells the story of Dax Xenos, a South American revolutionary who as a child witnesses the triple murder of his mother, his sister...and his puppy dog(!). Dax spends the rest of his life confusing sex and death. Among those along for fun in this laugh-a-minute ""drama"" are a wooden Candice Bergen as his wealthy American wife, Ernest Borgnine in Man-Tan as a Latino father figure, and Olivia deHavilland as a rich woman who hires Dax to be her gigolo. Every element of this one is pricelessly idiotic, from the costumes and sets to the music and sound effects. If you love bad movies, this one is a MUST!",1114646400,5,840,4.644295302013423
488805,3,6302632935,"Though ""The Adventurers"" has many of the trappings of a grand epic, it's ultimately one long trash wallow--one I thoroughly enjoyed. The engrossing story, about a South American playboy who vows to avenge the death of his parents, is a three-hour slog through violence, sex, deceit, more violence, polo, some more sex, silly fashion shows, marriage, divorce, double-crosses and another heaping helping of violence. You may not be impressed, but you certainly won't be bored. The cast is OK, with Ernest Borgnine making the most favorable impression. Bekim Fehmiu is adequate as Dax Xenos, though he looks more at home in the role in the latter third of the movie, when he's supposed to be in his late 30s, than in the first half when he's supposed to be in his early 20s. Candice Bergen tends to be wooden (comedy is more her fort), but she looks lovely, which is pretty much all that's expected of the women in this movie. Look for a young Jaclyn Smith in a bit part as a reporter.

""The Adventurers"" is big and expensive looking, but it can't escape the pulpiness of the Harold Robbins novel on which it's based. The book is much better, yet the movie isn't all that bad, either. When you consider some of the execrable movies made from Robbins' novels (""The Lonely Lady,"" anyone?), ""The Adventurers"" could've been a whole lot worse.",1106611200,4,1335,4.7296137339055795
488806,4,6302632935,"I caught this movie in theatres a couple of times when it was first released in 1970. It impressed me then and still does, for several reasons. First, it has a very good cast. And they are not completely wasted, only 75 percent wasted. Second, it has plenty of sex, violence, and the other human failings that make watching other people so much fun. Third, sure, it's overly ambitious, and falls well short of its grand intentions. But, it is a trip worth taking even if you know you're headed down a dead-end street.  Don't listen to the so-called experts. This movie is one that is worth making up your own mind. I'm still enjoying this film some 30 years later, and I think you will, too.",994809600,17,691,4.440944881889764

7828525,4,6302632935,"THE ADVENTURERS (1970), directed by Lewis Gilbert, color, 177 minutes, shot in Panavision.

This widely reviled film (The New Yorker gave it a one-word review: ""Rotten"") has found a second life on DVD. If only the Warner Bros. Archive Collection had the courage to release the original R-rated version; the one I got dated 2013 was rated PG, and clearly had been trimmed (a little nudity still appears in the rape and murder scene at the start). The film is far better than its reputation has it (it didn't get a good review in its first run, and failed at the box office), but now it is finding an audience. The film is epic, and reminds me of any number of other movies both before and after it--before would include ""Doctor Zhivago"", with a sprawling love story dwarfed by revolutionary times, ""Valley of the Dolls"", with its glossy, pop existential angst, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", the most Playboy-esque Bond picture, as well as the great drama of political corruption just before it came out, ""Z""; contemporary to it would include ""Ryan's Daughter"", where the main character is the cinematography; and following it would be ""The Godfather"", where corruption replaces family love; and ""Apocalypse Now"", which the massacre scenes prefigure. In fact, its release in spring 1970, when My Lai, the invasion of Cambodia, and Central American revolution were on many people's minds, is no coincidence. At times, the massacre of women and children felt like a direct comment on Vietnam. Thank goodness the film switches gears and jumps to the high life in Italy and the US east coast, where the scheming and betrayals were set at a lower key. I liked all the performances in the film except the rather flat adult Dax (Bekim Fehmiu); if only he could have continued the riveting performance given by the boy who played Dax in the first half hour, but the filmmakers opted for a Belmondo look-alike. This is the era of American film where you can count the number of seconds it takes for a bomb to go off, or for a rifle to fire, and it always does. But despite the tonal shifts and the limited central performance, the film (like the novel) is epic enough to sweep you along and make you forget the world for awhile.",1511049600,,2222,4.712082262210797
