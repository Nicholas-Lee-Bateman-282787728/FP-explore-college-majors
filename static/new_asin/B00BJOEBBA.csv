I find the One thig about Asian Movies I really like is they still show there are consequences for crimes & Just bad behavior! USA has gotten to a point where even when A Person who Is shot & Killed just because He is trying to do His Job! Or When He does Do the Job He is trained to do ,People blame Him all the way up to the Top of OUR Political scene! This One is not a trurh or Consequence Movie! Even though I appreciates The Real-Thought process You Need to put Into It! My Husband likes the  Asian DVD's &  Enjoys some Movies Of This Type! If You enjoy having to read Your Words to keep track of what is going On,This is a real mystery! I think It Takes Someone who Really Enjoys  Mysteries & Putting Pieces together One step at a time!",1395446400,4,814,3.98159509202454
