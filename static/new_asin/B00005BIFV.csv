1424479,3,B00005BIFV,"If you live in the US all of your life, you might find this series exotic. For an Asian like me, The movie has a weak plot and slow on action and too much Drama, for a fantacy movie. The Monkey King and his techer are the only things that were quite ok because they are quite funny. For some reasons, the goddess speech's annoyed me so (I rather listen to Arnold or Jacky Chan). I think they choose the wrong leading man, Shouldn't he be doing a romance or a comedy. Can't really point my finger on the wrong things but I only can see this movie once, not like Merlin, Gulliver's Travell, Arabian night, the Odessey ot even the 10th Kingdom. How ever it is still a little bit better than Noah's ark or Alice and wonderland.(all because of the exotic Eastern story).",999907200,,765,4.2827586206896555

The only problem I see is it had been adapted for an American audience so some of the original content had been changed. However, the music, costumes, sets, and special effects are first class. I recommend this popular Chinese children's fable to anyone who enjoys The Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland. Best damned made for TV adventure in years!",994723200,2,492,4.53932584269663

1424483,1,B00005BIFV,"despite the participation of david henry hwang, there were many miscalculated, unfortunate, misguided and tragic mistakes made in the production of this good-intentioned attempted.  a commentary seen in the l.a. times review describes more eloquently and directly my thoughts.
----
""The Lost Empire"" provides a touchstone for looking at ways that anti-Asian sentiments are practiced. I say ""sentiments"" because at this point I am somewhat reluctant to label the movie ""racist,"" at least until a fuller definition of the term is operative.
TYPICALLY, we might think of racism as discriminatory exclusionor discriminatory selection that is institutionally enforced: people of color not matriculating into higher education at proportionate rates to whites, not being promoted to upper-level management, racial profiling, etc. ""The Lost Empire"" turned this ""history of exclusion"" on its head, but in a way that is no less offensive to many Asians. The production accomplished this by injecting a white, male romantic lead into a Chinese myth where none before existed.
WHAT'S PARTICULARLY DISTURBING about ""The Lost Empire"" is that the inclusion of the white man was mandated to screenwriter David Henry Hwang. Further, it was made clear that this character was to serve as the romantic interest of the female Asian lead.
IN A STORY in The LA Times (""Ancient Mysteries,"" by Susan King, March 11), director Peter MacDonald said that producer Robert Halmi ""wanted the romance between Orton [the white male] and Kwan Ying [the Asian female] to be the most important element in the adventure.""That's a far  cry from an ancient Chinese myth where whites weren't even present. Indeed, can you imagine the reaction if Asian filmmakers decided to tell the American myth of Paul Bunyan with an Asian actor as the lead?
TRYING TO PIN DOWN motivation for the inclusion of whites in ethnic films is an endeavor best left to another essay. For now, let us simply include ""The Lost Empire"" with other films in Hollywood's history that have, for their own reasons, placed white males in lead roles in otherwise Asian stories. Films that come to mind are ""Come See the Paradise"" (1990), which placed a white, romantic male lead squarely in the story of the Japanese American internment, and ""Year of the Dragon"" (1985), which placed a white, romantic male lead in New York's Chinatown. A more recent example is ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" (1999), which also dealt with World War II internment. And then there's the hit Broadway play ""Miss Saigon."" In each case, the white male was the romantic lead to an Asian woman.
ASIANS and other groups underrepresented on television, such as racial minorities, gays, lesbians and the physically and mentally challenged, deserve the same level of respect as the mainstream. But they need to make their voices heard. And network and studio executives must listen.
THE FRAMEWORK FOR IMPROVED RELATIONS is in place: Underrepresented groups have advocacy organizations that can be consulted, and the networks, as a result of the NAACP-led protests in 1999, have vice presidents for diversity. Now everyone involved must make two-way communication the norm. One thing is clear: Unless meaningful, ongoing dialogue is established during the script development process, the door to more cultural insults such as ""The Lost Empire"" will remain open.",989193600,13,3356,5.236059479553903

The production design and the costumes and the CGI, considering that the movie was released in 2001 is nicely done.  It seems more like a sound studio movie but all this falls away once you focus on the story with the help of the actors' characterization of the main characters (the scholar, quan yin, the 3 warriors...) with flaws and insecurities makes them more humanly relatable .

1424526,5,B00005BIFV,"My review doesn't match my stars!
Please, someone, recommend a GOOD Monkey King DVD that I can watch in the USA!
From an American point of view, I enjoyed the fact that it was Monkey. I've read two translations, but until this, had never seen Monkey on-screen (for another western taste, get Forbidden Kingdom). I loved this, except for the stupid love story. There is no place for that in Monkey, and I found it offensive. If you are from Asia, you may be offended at what America has done to a venerable tale and to the Goddess of Compassion. I don't blame you. I keep rewriting this in my head. Hollywood screws up everything. At least, thank God, Disney hasn't got a hold of it.  Well, getting on with it:
Read the one-star reviews first, then go up the scale. Since other reviews will tell you what you need to know, I'll say this: If you are a westerner who is unfamiliar with Monkey's Journey to the West (one of the world's most popular tales, even if we don't know it), this is a fair introduction, even if it is inaccurate and offensive. I know, offensive is a bad word. Think of the old Westerns, where the indians were all white actors, or minstrel shows, where the actors were all in blackface. It's that kind of offensive. But like those old westerns, you can still enjoy this film for what it is.
It was fun watching the terra cotta army, the Chinese version of heaven (so filled with beaurocrats and civil servants), and Monkey and crew. I found it a lot of fun, except for the offensive romantic relationship. I can take bastardizing a tale as long as Journey to the West. I can even allow a western scholar to bridge a cultural gap, even if Another White Man to the Rescue bores and angers me. I was disgusted at the turning the Goddess of Compassion into an airbrained, ditsy sex toy (albeit a chaste one).
Still, probably because I am a westerner, I enjoyed this for what it is. Funny, because I can't enjoy Disney's destruction of Little Mermaid or the Pocahontas rape/kidnapping.
Anyhow, I enjoyed it and watch it regularly, which is why I gave it five stars. Enjoying it does not take away any of the negatives, but the negatives do not take away from the pure fun of this.",1289347200,2,2196,4.435643564356436
1424527,4,B00005BIFV,"I thought that this was an enjoyable movie. I love the Monkey King and his friends. They are the best part of the movie. I thought Thomas Gibson was really good as Nick (The Scholar from Above). I think for the time that the movie was made the special effects are pretty good. There are some good values in this movie. The fight against good and evil, Making choices, and facing the concequences for your actions. There is a little bit for every one. Great fight scenes, comedy, and alittle bit of love. I do have a few things I don't like about the movie, but over all I would highly recommend this movie.",1281916800,,606,4.324561403508772
1424528,1,B00005BIFV,"I borrowed this DVD from my uncle. Someone had given it to him and he gave it to me. Now I know why. This is probably one of the worst films of all time. It was so bad, I couldn't get past the first 10 minutes of it, and that was really pushing it. The script is horrendous and the acting is pathetic. I don't know who Ling Bai is and neither do any of my Chinese friends or my Chinese wife, but she is a terrible actress. I'm quite sure she is an unknown in China. The rest of the actors aren't any better. If anyone gives you a copy of this DVD, do yourself a favor and immediately throw it in the trash where it belongs.

1424529,4,B00005BIFV,"This is not real mythology, but it does mention several legit Chinese myths.  Of course, it's not meant for a mythology or history lesson, it's meant for entertainment.  This is not a great movie by any stretch.  Having read the reviews already on here, it's not even a good movie to some people.  It is, however, entertaining and fun to watch.  Yeah, the story does wander off of the plot a few times, but it always meanders back.  The acting is hardly Oscar caliber, but the actors are good enough to get the point across.  Ling Bai is very good as the Goddess of Mercy.  She is able to be sweet, sexy and heroic at the same time.  The main selling point for me, though, is that my 9 year old granddaughter and I can watch this movie and enjoy it together.  She likes the character of the goddess and that gives her a good female role model in the movies and that's not something a lot of movies offer these days (ie Mean Girls).

Thomas Gibson plays a splendid ""scholar from above"", a reluctant hero with a fairly decent backhand at racquetball.  Russell Wong is perfect as the Monkey King, cocky and exceedingly sure of himself.  The companions Pigsy and Friar Sand play very well as sidekicks.  Bai Ling is flawlessly beautiful as Kwan Yin, the goddess who brings ""the scholar from above"" into the mystical world and save it from the evil Shu and the Five Traditional Masters.  The dialog is quirky-an interesting mix of classical Chinese and 21st century slang.  If you're looking for an historical deeply significant film, this isn't it.

1424534,4,B00005BIFV,"I've read the other reviews available at the time this one is being written, and this film has some enthusiasts and some absolute haters. I'd like to offer a more centrist look in the hopes that it might make a little more sense. I gave this film 4 stars as center leaning towards fun and inspiration.

I'm a graduate student doing research on modern Japanese interpretations of ""Journey to the West"", ""Suikoden"", and ""Fenshen Yanyi"", and let me tell you, this film doesn't even compare to the weirdest, out of context interpretations the Japanese have done with this classic story. One of the most popular modern Manga adaptations of Journey to the West has the scripture pilgrim (who Mr. Gibson replaces in ""The Lost Kingdom"" [sort of]) as a gun toting, beer drinking, gambling, meat eating, rebel (""Gensomaden Saiyuki"" by Kazuya Minekura). Another has him as a harmonica playing traveler in a post apocalyptic world (""Assobot Goku"" by ARIMORI Jyoji), and don't get me started on ""Dragon Ball"". It doesn't detract from the story all that much to have a white guy in the lead roll if you've already trudged through that, especially since this movie is obviously designed for a Western audience.

On the pros side: This movie is entertaining. Its family friendly and it's not bogged down for a casual watcher in fancy dialogue. In fact, it's very much in the new millennia so far as most of the language goes. Having read the full original novel for my research, having every other paragraph be poetry would not have worked here. You'll laugh at it most of the way through. Fun Martial Arts sequences can be found throughout the film. You don't really have to know anything about the original story to watch it (but it helps). Amazing costumes and makeup are used in this film. It's very aesthetic.

On the cons side: It's not accurate in a lot of places. It's also not really trying to be. This strikes me as a movie that would have made a better book. The acting is not as good as most American's would expect, but it probably could pass for a BBC Miniseries in a Dr. Who/Neverwhere kind of style. Its special effects aren't stellar (although what they lose in quality they certainly made up for in quantity). It's important to remember that this movie is not supposed to be a retelling of the original legend, but more of a really campy sequel. Yes, Confucius is a lying swindler in this. He seems to embody more of what the government in modern day China is in this film that what he historically was. It seems relatively obvious that his character is simply a way to move the plot. It's unfortunate that they chose a historic scholar to corrupt.

Why is it worth a watch then? ""Journey to the West"" was historically a series of stories that were circulating long before Wu Cheng'en put it to paper in the Ming Dynasty, and those legends differ slightly across East Asia. The reason the collective works had so much meaning was that they were the literary pieces of the time that allowed for integration of Taoist beliefs, Buddhist beliefs, and Confucian ideals peacefully, and that union is part of what created the Chinese identity. ""The Lost Kingdom"" has taken bits and pieces of the original and used them with Western ideas to introduce the legend to a new audience. In the beginning narrative of the film, the main character even likens himself to a 'western cowboy' in China. There is no attempt at all to hide that this is a best fit cultural merge. It's an effort to bring cultures together for 3 hours that could spawn a search for a better understanding of Chinese culture (despite the fact that this doesn't match the original creator's full intent at the outset).

My academic pursuits of Chinese and Japanese literature started from a Japanese science fiction adaptation of Fenshen Yanyi as a 10 year old. Aliens in Ancient China who wear turbans (""Houshin Engi"" by Fujisaki Ryuu) didn't put me off finding out the truth behind the original. Who knows what this film could inspire?

It's worth a watch. It's funny, and it's campy, but don't take it seriously. I understand declaring it 'Racist' and 'insulting' makes big headlines in news papers, and that sells issues, or gets blog hits, but the movie doesn't take itself that seriously, and making broad sweeping declarations about it probably means you've worked yourself up for nothing.",1239667200,6,4358,4.735177865612648

1424536,4,B00005BIFV,"I rarely write reviews because it is so time consuming to write a good/thorough review.

I have read the other reviews for this movie and would like to submit an alternative way of looking at this movie.  First, I do like the movie.  It is exactly as it was designed to be - bloodless battles, villians that are larger than life, heroes that are equally large, and special effects that will never win any awards.  The movie is simply 'fun' if you can leave your brain at the sidelines for a while.  Who wouldn't want to learn to fly on clouds, learn martial arts from a mystic instructor, and battle dragons, demons and evil spirits all for the love of the beautiful goddess (ladies, just substitute 'handsome god') and to save the world?

That hardly seems like enough reason to give a movie a '4 star' rating though.  I grant that the movie is hardly accurate in its portrail of Chinese mythology and/or religious beliefs.  However, it is the kind of movie that makes the viewer want to know more.  Does the book ""Journey to the West"" really exist?  Are there really stories about The Monkey King, Piggsy and the other gods that appear in the movie?  Are the stories similar to the mythology and fables of other countries that teach lessons as they amuse the young (and not so young)?  Who is the Jade Emporer and what is his place in Chinese history/theology?  China is a country that is rich in history and this movie can make the viewer ask the questions that can start him/her down the road to appreciating another culture.

In summation, I found ""The Lost Empire"" to be an enjoyable film with the potential to cause the curious viewer to begin an appreciation for another culture.",1203897600,9,1687,4.561461794019934

The only one that can act is the damn monkey and even then the character development is slim. I always buy Halmark movies, they've been great (10th Kingdom etc) but this one is the worst movie they've ever endorsed. I read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance-save yourself the dissapointment. The movie could have been so good. The plot is quite good but the screenplay, acting, effects, are not. A goddess having a drink at the bar...come on, even I won't watch something that lame. Mythology is something I love but the way these people portray it becomes laughable, and disrespects the story it's trying to tell. Most of all you can't even like the hero because he is so annoying! Buy the Snow Queen, Jack and the Beanstalk, DEFINETLY 10th Kingdom, but don't buy this movie!

1424540,4,B00005BIFV,Well done modern telling of a classic Chinese tale.  Some special effects were not up to todays standards but that did not get in the way of a well done story.,1180137600,2,159,4.129032258064516
1424541,3,B00005BIFV,"I picked 3 stars as a medium for this movie.

For those of you who enjoy mythical worlds for entertainment purposes, then you might rank this as high as 4 stars.  Though the acting by Thomas Gibson (playing journalist Nick Orton, the Scholar) falls a bit flat, Russell Wong makes for an enthusiastic and entertaining Monkey King.  The costumes are nicely done, particularly that of Pigsy, and the martial arts scenes are well choregraphed though a little cheesy sometimes.  The special effects, while not perfect quality, give the movie character and a touch of humor.

For those of you who favor accuracy, this probably falls as low as two stars.  (1 if you are an extremist, but then why did you even bother watching this?)  The movie was created with little regard of the historical/modern origins of Buddhist religion.  Issues of particular note are:
1. the Goddess Kwan Ying's deception/drunkenness at the begining of the movie and the romantic feelings throughout the film conflicting with the modern view of the holy figure Guan Yin (whom Kwan Ying is based on)**
2. the portrayal of Confucious as greedy and selfish instead of wise
3. (though not a religious issue) there seems to be a little bit of a dig at Chinese communism in the movie's second half which may be too much for the politically sensitive.  There is some obvious emphasis on Western values such as individualism vs the collectivism of the Chinese.

** For those of you crying bloody murder over the portrayal of Guan Yin and looking for a warped version of a Christian holy figure, see the movie series 'Prophecy' by Gregory Widen. (Interestingly, Russell Wong is also a lead in Prophecy II as Danyael.)  The archangel Gabriel has turned against the Christian God and the humans of God's creation.  The warping of holy figures doesn't just happen to those of Chinese origin - it happens everywhere.

Note: THIS IS ***NOT*** A RECREATION OF 'JOURNEY TO THE WEST'!!!

Too many people seem to be expecting this.  If you are looking for a retelling of 'Journey to the West', keep going as this is not for you.  This is a Westernized story that pulls elements from the story ""Journey to the West"".  You will not find a cast of all Asian characters. You will not find Buddhism or Confucionism presented here accurately.  This is an entertainment piece and not a historical one.  This was made for a the general American (and European?) audience and not an Asian one.",1165276800,8,2435,4.768496420047732
1424542,3,B00005BIFV,"it's funny reading some of you ppl ...

making such a big deal over religion, confucius, kuan yin, and all that.

 you're so self-righteous that you missed the point of this movie.

kuan yin falls in love with the teacher. she knew she was risking the loss of her godliness ... but being the goddess of mercy,

she was willing to do what she needed to do ...

in order to save the world.

that is what compassion is all about.

confucians being insulted that their master is portray as a snivelling self-centred so and so?

well, maybe he was as self-righteous as those who put down this movie.

step back and stop looking at it from the perspective of the true message; not from what the pig, monkey, kuan yin, white man, yellow man, whatever.

the story and message is good over evil.

and that even gods can fall in love.

some , like monkey , finds love as rather unnecessary.

but, is it not due to their own self-centeredness?

like monkey, who is portrayed as rather arrogant and too concerned with himself. is it no surprise that he finds loving another person unnecessary? he's too much engrossed in himself.

i don't think it was the intention to insult anybody's beliefs  or what not. what's the point?

the story is interesting, and the fights are kept to a minimum...

not like the jackie chan and jet li, or kill bill

overkill.

it's meant to send a message , as kuan yin tells the scholar:

you cannot do wrong if you listen to your heart.

remember your past, you were hurt by love,

but you can do great things if you only continue to listen to your heart.

that's all there is ...

no great insults, no subversive insinuations,

... just a simple message.

why make mountains out of molehills???

 in closing,

every one has their own perspective of what is and what is not.

we're all unique, and sometimes we need to see it from the other person point of view.

you are not wrong, neither am i. we're just different...

and why don't you just enjoy the movie, huh?

it's an enjoyable movie.

at the end, with monkey , pig and the other walking away...

it reminds me of tin man, lion,...

of wizard of oz.

that was a fun movie, and an unforgettable one,

 and so is this one.",1155686400,9,2197,4.365671641791045
1424543,4,B00005BIFV,"OK, I rounded up to 4 stars. This really isn't bad, though.

It's an idiom that most American viewers won't be familiar with. The major characters are Kuan Yin, Confucius, and a flock of other gods, godlings, immortals, buddhas, figures from myth, and other well-known figures and stereotypes from the Chinese pantheon. There are the flying heroes, improbable weapons, and acting at least on a par with the Dr. Who series. In other words, lots of viewers will see it as alien, disconnected, and amateurish, as well as being filled overly convenient miracles.

But it's not in the Western idiom, so parts of it have to be taken in their own terms. And it has the look of a low-budget film, so you won't see effects on the Star Wars scale. And it is a bit cheesy and over-the-top, which is part of the appeal.

The fights are bloodless, the romance is chaste, and all but the youngest kids will understand the characters. If you don't take it or yourself too seriously, there's a lot of fun in this one.

1424544,3,B00005BIFV,"If you are at all familiar with Chinese fantasy stories this was right in line with that genre: Huge monsters, forbidden places, animal-men who kick martial art (...).

Was this A Chinese Ghost Story I, II or III? No.
But it was still fun to watch and a lot more kid oriented then the Chinese Ghost story movies or many of the Chinese fantasy movies made. Not to mention it is in English so you don't have to read subtitles or hear a bad dub.

I think the biggest downer of this movie was the main protagonist (played by Thomas Gibson) just isn't a good actor. The rest of the cast was just fine. Does Russell Wong ever age?

This movie not up to par with the direction or story telling as the Hallmark verion of Gulliver's Travels or The Odyssey, which in my opinion are more serious stories made for adults anyway.

My kids thought Piggsy (the pig-man) kicking martial arts (...) with a rake was hilarious. They didn't get the love story aspect of the movie, nor was it directed well so you felt a connection with the story and actors. They loved when Monkey was flying in the sky and how cool he was.

1424545,1,B00005BIFV,"First, this piece of trash is based on The Journey To The West about as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on the Bible. There are some characters common to both Lost Empire and Journey. Well, common in name. That said let's get to the real problem with this film. It is astoundingly insulting to Chinese religious traditions. Imagine for a moment some non-Christian producing a film in which: the God Jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to Satan; Jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power; and the Virgin Mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars. Sound offensive? It is. And this film is equally insulting to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism (the three big ones in China).

Confucius, a man revered these past 2500 years for his uncompromising moral standards appears in Lost Empire as a lecherous,traitorous,lying,cowardly weasel.

The Jade Emperor,Taoism's chief God, is shown as a despondent,apathetic slob who no longer cares about the earthly or celestial realms.

Kuan Yin, one of the Bodhisattvas, is shown in Lost Empire falling in romantic and physical love with a man. That is as likely as the Virgin Mary turning tricks on a street corner.

If some religious bigot wanted to disguise a piece of anti-Chinese propaganda as a clever adventure-fantasy they could not easily do better than The Lost Empire. It makes me wonder if the insult was intended.",1106784000,12,1490,4.80859375

1424547,3,B00005BIFV,"First of all there WAS people who were White in Asian before Europeans even started circumnavigating the globe. They've found mummies in China that appeared to be Caucasions (right done to the DNA testing that was done) that were there for nearly a millenium.

Going all long with that, the monk in the story that Thomas Gibson replaces was known as The White Monk. So its not a far stretch to have a White man who is a scholar searching to protect the text when The White Monk was the one in the original story who set The Monkey King free and was the one on the journey to take the texts from India to China so that China would have the Buddist texts.

Gods and Goddesses in every religion vary in the way they act. They are not forbidden from any act because they are above us mortals. They can do what they want because they have more ability.  Mara, the God who become the Buddist version of Lucifer, tries to tempt everyone including tempting Buddha with women. A god can do things, but they would have to deal with the kharma.

Yes they are some gross misrepresentations of the story. But you have to realize that it is a Western version of a story.  Eastern version's of Western stories have serious flaws, but we still accept them if they are well done as a story.

If anything we should be complaining that this story did a better representation than Dragon Ball.

Overall this is a decent movie, not the best but I've seen worse representation of ""The Journey to The West"" in films that were made in China. so considering the culture gap it was well done.

Its worth getting for less than $12, anything more is a joke for any DVD.",1098316800,2,1641,4.375

As someone has already pointed out, Quan Yin is a Buddhishiva of compassion.  Buddhists don't have romantic affairs, eat meat, or drink alcohol.

Its makers seem to assume, rightly or wrongly, that its audience will be unable to relate to a ""foreign"" story unless a white guy is inserted, however incongruously, into the action.  As if this were not bad enough, the idea of the ""hero"" comducting a romantic affair with Kuan Yin must be deeply offensive to many people of Chinese extraction.

1424552,3,B00005BIFV,"The Lost Empire / The Monkey King is a mini series that tells the story of Nicholas Orton (Thomas Gibson) who finds himself on a save-the-world mission. The plot itself is a bit difficult to follow - it is loosely inspired by 'Journey to the West'- the famous chinese epic. However in this version, it shows us what would happen if 'Journey to the West' had never existed. Demons are trying to destroy the book (for the simple reason of that's what evil demons do with their spare time) and the world is running backwards because of it, deleting all the things that 'Journey to the West' helped inspire (which includes buildings and clocks, strangely enough). So the Goddess of Mercy, Kwan Ying (Ling Bai) travels from her world to find the prophesied Scholar from Above - our own Nick Orton. He is 'above' because all of the mythological characters he later mets live in a copy of China in one of the (very, very, very large) unexcavated tombs, under the musuem. So with the help of Kwan Ying and the famous terracotta warriors that come to life, Nick finds himself inside the tomb/copy of mythological China, faced with the sacastic Monkey King (Russell Wong) who was been trapped inside a mountain by those same demons that are out to destroy 'Journey to the West'.
As you can see, the premise is quite confusing, so if you like to sit down and get a nice, logical plot, you might want to give this one a miss, as our heroes do a lot of wandering around and your not actually sure where they're going or why.
However, if you are a fan of other Hallmark fantasy mini-series (the Magical Legend of the Leprechauns, Merlin, Arabian Nights, the 10th Kingdom, the Voyage of the Unicorn) then this is the movie for you. Like the others it boasts great special effects, great set-designs and Kwan Ying and her consort Whitesnake wear the most beautiful outfits I've seen. The lovely Ling Bai is perfectly cast as the Goddess of Mercy, and the scenes that take place in the home of the gods are wonderful. Nick and his reluctant teacher the Monkey King are good too, and get some good one-liners, and their allies Pigsy and Friar Sand should appeal to kids. The romance between Nick and Kwan Ying is nothing new, but still enjoyable to watch, and the carefully choreographed martial-art sequences are amazing.
If you are a Chinese-historian or a purist of any kind, I advise you to steer clear, as I'm sure Confucius wasn't an annoying, back-stabbing traiter as he is portrayed here, but everyone else should just sit down and enjoy the ride without being picky.",1016496000,26,2557,4.6219780219780215
