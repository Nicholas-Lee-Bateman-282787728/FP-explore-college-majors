3588785,5,B001FSDP30,"This story tells of George Ellery Hale and his epic struggles to build
the 40"",100"", and the 200"" telescopes.
Hale also had to battle mental illness and he was truly heroic as
he never gave up!
The focus of the story is the great 200"" telescope on Palomar.
The Hale telescope is still a cutting edge instrument after 60
years and I found that it is at least 100 times more powerful
than when it was first built due to the support technology built
for it bt Cal-tech.
This is my all time favorite science special. Watch it and enjoy!",1268870400,,532,4.33
3588786,5,B001FSDP30,"I had the opportunity to see this documentary presented in its near final cut at Caltech in the presence of most of the living members of the Hale family. It's an excellent effort, and well worth watching for anyone interested in telescopes or the history of astronomy. Also a good choice for inspiring a child interested in astronomy or engineering.

For nearly a century (93 years by my count) the largest productive astronomical telescope in the world was one of Hale's creations. (The Yerkes 40"", the 60"" and 100"" on Mt. Wilson, and the 200"" Palomar telescope, named after Hale.) He also established the the Yerkes, Mt. Wilson, and Palomar Mountain observatories, co-founded the Astrophysical Journal, was instrumental in creating the modern Caltech, created the greatest solar telescopes of his time, invented the spectroheliograph, and conducted research in solar astronomy. This documentary is good introduction to the amazing man Hale was, and the unprecedented accomplishment the ""Hale Telescope"" represented.

A documentary can't, of course, give you the depth of information that a good book can. If this DVD whets you appetite for more, turn to ""The Perfect Machine"" by  Ronald Florence for more about the 200"" scope, or ""Explorer of the Universe: A Biography of George Ellery Hale"" by  Helen Wright (sadly out of print, but available used) for more about the remarkable man.",1245628800,11,1387,5.178571428571429
3588787,5,B001FSDP30,"This is a beautiful documentary that tells a compelling story about how some very American traits -- individualism, salesmanship, sensationalism, competition, even greed -- became the basis for one of mankind's greatest scientific achievements, mapping the universe.

George Ellery Hale was born to privilege, but in Chicago, where even the wealthy and influential need a combination of sharp elbows and charm to get ahead. He applied what he learned in order to get support for the Yerkes Observatory from a dastardly streetcar tycoon, for Mt. Wilson from the ultimate captain of industry, Andrew Carnegie, and finally, for Mt. Palomar from the heirs of Rockefeller.

That Hale was driven by a passion for science, not personal wealth or glory, makes the story more fascinating.  The man literally ran himself ragged in his quest to build telescopes that first proved and then added to Einstein's theories, eventually suffering from stress-induced hallucinations. As is said in the film, Hale had ""the American disease"" -- a nervous breakdown caused by ambition and overachievement.

At various points, there were serious doubts about the viability of Hale's ideas.  The sequence at the Corning glass factory, illustrated by some amazing archival footage, is a good example.  It was unknown whether glassmakers could produce a mirror of the size and perfection that would be needed to make the telescope work.  The sequences demonstrates American ingenuity, but also shows the high degree of frustration and disappointment that must be tolerated along the way toward an engineering breakthrough.

The film effortlessly shifts between the drama of how the telescopes got built and what they taught us.  At the end of the film, the filmmakers show us all of the scientific milestones that Mt. Palomar enabled, most of them long after Hale's death, proving that it is possible to get teary-eyed at recitation of facts about the cosmos.

George Hale's name is not one that most Americans think of when they think of the most important contributors to science to come from our shores.  ""The Journey to Palomar"" should go a long way toward correcting that omission.  Hale was one of the greatest Americans of the 20th century, and this film finally gives him his due in the motion-picture format.",1241049600,16,2291,5.178861788617886
3588788,5,B001FSDP30,This DVD is a must for anyone teaching Astronomy and the history of US observational Astronomy weather as a Home-schooler or in a classroom .It presents the Stories of the Palomar and the Yerkes Telescopes and George Ellery Hales obsession with  building larger and better Telescopes in order to push forward Mankind's Knowledge of the Universe in a clear manner. As with all PBS Home Video's it's good value for money and a valuable addition to a home or school collection,1234742400,7,473,4.839506172839506
3588789,3,B001FSDP30,"This show attempts to do three things at once, be a biography of George Hale, explain astronomy, and document the creation of three large telescopes (Yerkes, Wilson, Palomar).

Let's start with the bad news. The biography of Hale is so sketchy you'll be running to Wikipedia to make sense of it. It starts with Hale as a 12-yr old watching Chicago burn. In the next scene he's having his father build him a major observatory. Ummm, did he go to college somewhere? Was his father rich? No clues here. Later his wife appears for a quote or two but is otherwise ignored. He speaks fluently about the arts and Italian art to the wife of one of his backers... when did he have an interest in that? No clue here about that either.

As for the second thread, the narration attempts to justify the creation of these ground-breaking new telescopes by giving very brief descriptions about what astronomers wanted them for. Unfortunately there's way too much 20-20 hindsight and these diversions make no sense either.

The show's real strength is in the raw history of the telescopes themselves. They seem to have found a mother lode of wonderful photographs showing many under construction photos of the telescopes.

So if you're interested in telescopes, this DVD is 5-stars. As entertainment, it's somewhat annoying due to the many gaps in the story line.",1233532800,6,1347,4.818181818181818
3588790,5,B001FSDP30,"This documentary is just brilliant! What George Hale did for astronomy is mind boggling. I urge all of you reading this not to miss this enoromously important film. There is a book too, it's called The Perfect Machine by Ronald Florence.",1226880000,9,237,4.804878048780488
3588791,5,B001FSDP30,"Having seen this film 3 times now (most recently at a screening in the dome that houses his final creation, the 200"" Hale Telescope) I am glad to finally be able to add it to my collection!

Journey to Palomar takes us along on the journey that was the life of George Ellery Hale. From a small boy up through the building of four of the worlds largest telescopes. The film makers also included some awesome information about the future of large telescopes. Thanks to Hale, we have a better understanding of the universe around us.

I consider this film a must see for anyone interested in Astronomy, and a great starting point for the rest of us. It shows us that one person through drive and determination can make a difference.",1225756800,18,729,4.515151515151516

8302602,4,B001FSDP30,"This is one of the most important stories of the 20th century. It's an amazing tale of the inspired genius of George Ellery Hale, who designed and got the money to build the three largest and most important telescopes in the world.",1423872000,2,231,4.523809523809524
8302603,5,B001FSDP30,Excellent story.,1422489600,,16,7.5
8302604,4,B001FSDP30,"This is a very well made, 90 minute biography of George Ellery Hale, the well-born, brilliant, driving solar astronomer (or astronomical entrepreneur) who was responsible for the building of the successively larger observatories:  Kenwood, Yerkes, Wilson and (postmortem) Palomar.  I would only add that the theme is interpreted through the dry scientism of the current era and that, in a rather amorphous way, the spirituality, for want of a better word, that was the motivation behind Hale and his coworkers is lacking.  One ends wondering why it was all done.  A second criticism I would have is that the comment is made that Hale had hallucinations, in telling others of the little elf who bedeviled him.  If you read about Hale in depth, you'll find that the elf is simply his personification of his episodes of depression, much as Abraham Lincoln personified HIS depression as a black dog.  He did not hallucinate this critter.  (Overall, it would seem that Hale was most likely bipolar, with his energetic pursuit of observatory building the result of his manic phases - and that he was not a schizophrenic, the mental illness more typically associated with hallucinations).
Finally, amateur astronomers will relish the brief segment of Russell Porter, the fellow amateur who participated in the design of the Palomar telescope and building and who left us such pleasing drawings of these.",1421280000,4,1396,5.1233480176211454
8302605,5,B001FSDP30,Excellent all the way around. I would buy from them again. Very satisfied overall.,1414713600,,82,4.928571428571429
8302606,5,B001FSDP30,"Informative, revealing and beautifully made movie. I went to the observatory and that was a journey too. Over hills and dales, thru Native American reservations and up winding roads. I've driven up the scary road to Mt. Hamilton near San Jose. Made me want more info on Mt. Wilson. Perhaps the road to Mt. Wilson will not be so daunting.",1383868800,2,337,4.633333333333334
8302607,5,B001FSDP30,"The Journey to Palomar dvd documentary is just outstanding.  Very well done and
informative.  The whole story of Palomar's journey is just so intriquing.  Don't
hesitate to buy.",1381449600,2,177,5.25
8302608,5,B001FSDP30,"I am an amatuer astronomer and just loved the history of Palomar Observatory (actually worked with the 18"" and even touch the 200""). You really get a sense of what it took to complete such a huge endeavor back then. Hale was a wonderful man. Also have the book 'The Perfect Machine' about building the 200"". Would like to see other stories about Lick, Mt. Wilson, Yerkes, etc. Turn of the Century Astronomy, got to love it. Thanks",1282003200,3,430,4.5256410256410255
