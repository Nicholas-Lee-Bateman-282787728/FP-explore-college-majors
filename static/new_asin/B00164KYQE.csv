3151086,5,B00164KYQE,Another TV show cancelled before it's time. The strike killed this one off. It was a great show produced by Bruce from the kids in the hall. I hope they will at least put the ones out that were aired maybe if we are lucky some that weren't? That'd be nice!,1224115200,3,256,4.03921568627451
3151087,4,B00164KYQE,This was a great show.  It was goofy and fun.  It is a shame that it didn't get picked up for another season.  There is no info. anywhere as to when the first season will be on DVD.  Any details from anyone?!?!?!?!?,1223424000,2,215,4.0476190476190474
3151088,4,B00164KYQE,My wife and I loved this show. It didn't get great reviews from the critics though.  I hate when networks don't give T.V. shows time enough to develop a large audience.  It also helps when it is in a prime time slot. Jerry O'Connell is awesome in this show. The whole cast made the show so funny. I hope it comes out on video soon.  Atleast we will have one great season of this show to watch.,1221350400,4,393,4.077922077922078
3151089,5,B00164KYQE,"This show was by far the best comedy TV show of the 2007 Fall Season. Sadly the seaon ended so abruptly (for all of the shows) but especially for this one before it gained an audience. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. I have a few shows taped from the season and I watch them over and over. I now wish I had recorded all of the shows. The four main characters worked so well together it didn't matter at all what they were going through. I guess this just ads up to good casting, good script writing and great actors.",1215561600,12,524,4.0
3151090,5,B00164KYQE,"One of the best television comedies in recent history - and most certainly one of the few television shows I still bothered to tune-in faithfully each week.  I don't have the show info in front of me as I type this for episode titles, but the episode on Work-Place Sexual Harassment still has me suddenly bursting out in ""inappropriate"" laughter just at the memory of this great, brief show! And who names their kid Marmaduke?!?  Funny, funny, funny.  Well worth the DVD purchase price & viewing time (face it, you'll watch this over & over), should it ever be released. A big ""Thank You!"" to the people who gave us this great TV program.",1214870400,15,638,4.578947368421052
3151091,4,B00164KYQE,This is one of the best new shows for 07-08.  The ratings were not great but this show is really funny.  I have not seen the dvd yet so I can't comment on it.,1210550400,6,158,3.6176470588235294

8260819,5,B00164KYQE,"I adored this show and was so disappointed when it was unceremoniously cancelled. TJ Miller was wonderful and so uniquely funny. Not a cookie-cutter comedy, the writing was fresh, clever and hilarious. I hope they make the dvds available soon!",1346716800,,243,5.1
8260820,5,B00164KYQE,"I loved this show SO much, and I'm still waiting for the dvd's. I felt the same about ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"", and IT finally came out on dvd. Everyone I've shared it with has loved it. Fresh, funny characters you care about, reference, and  long to see each week. When Carpoolers comes out on dvd, everyone will love it just as much. !",1343692800,,349,4.369230769230769
8260821,5,B00164KYQE,"Ok! I'm in when the DVD for ""Carpoolers"" becomes available.  I agree with others about the mystery of why these great shows are cancelled without a vote from the viewers.  Please make this past series available soon.",1298851200,2,216,4.8108108108108105
8260822,5,B00164KYQE,"I loved ""Carpoolers"". I would buy all the episodes shown if they become available. I especially liked the episode about the wolf mistaken for a dog. It seems everytime I like a new sitcom it gets cancelled.",1275955200,4,206,4.594594594594595
8260823,5,B00164KYQE,"By far the best sitcom since Parker Lewis Can't Loose and Boy Meets World, which both actually got progressively bad over several seasons. I totally agree with other comments that carpoolers is really for the whole family and it is so much more fun to watch than any other recent sitcom just because the humor is very subtle, not just blurted out jokes and catchy phrases. Actually I imagine it terribly boring for simple minded people but unfortunately they appear to make up the biggest part of the audience. If you pay attention to the details of Carpoolers, almost every second is funny. It gives you a good feeling and you can actually enjoy a relaxing evening after work watching it. You won't get tense, worried, frightened, or bored. It's just a very good time. You can watch every episode over and over again. I am most impressed, however, by the actors, everyone perfectly fit for the role, and every role being something completely new. I have never seen such characters on a sitcom before. Especially ""Marmaduke"", who's subtle clumsiness, which is never put into the foreground of the plot, is so well played, making it just the most hilarious slapstick I've ever seen. And seriously, that scene where Aubrey gets ready for a foot massage for his wife and spays that microwave heated coconut oils in his face - I died. Where is that in any other recent sitcom? Boohoo-drama, corps slaughter, and real-life boredom, that all there is. I am really looking forward to the DVD releases and I am really, really hoping that ABC will come up with some new sitcom soon for people like me, who want an intelligent plot in a nice atmosphere that I can enjoy and laugh about while relaxing with my family, in the evening after a hard day of work.",1268784000,3,1747,4.656957928802589
8260824,5,B00164KYQE,"I only discovered this show last week and have been watching dodgy streams from Korea (I think). I'm in Australia so I don't really understand the American system, but I thought it must have been considered 'bad' to have been cancelled and there must have been something odd about me for loving it! So I'm glad to read of others who also think it is a great show. The performances are excellent and the whole thing moves along beautifully. I love the premise and the way it is fleshed out differently in each show. Jerry O'Connell as the ridiculous 'Laird' is a revelation - he's far from a household name here and I didn't realise he was so good a comic actor *and* so 'devastatingly handsome':-) The Marmaduke character deserves a cult following on his own. I'll buy the DVD as soon as it's out and hang the postage to Australia. (I'm presuming it *will* come out?).",1264204800,2,868,4.535031847133758

8260826,5,B00164KYQE,"It's disappointing when fresh, original shows like this don't find an audience. My wife and I looked forward to this show every week. It was something we both could watch and enjoy. There was nothing else like it on television, and perhaps that's the reason it was yanked. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD because it was quite literally one of the best sitcoms of the past ten years. Easy.",1239321600,7,395,4.351351351351352
8260827,5,B00164KYQE,"I don't get to watch much tv anymore but this is one I would plan my day around.  If I missed it I would watch online at abc.  It was just plain funny!  My wife and I absolutely loved every single character.

It was so disappointing that it was canceled but I searched everywhere on the internet and found some sites that were showing it online.

I will buy this dvd the day it comes out.  Fingers crossed.",1232150400,5,406,4.141025641025641
8260828,4,B00164KYQE,"It gets a bit tiring when all the shows I fall in love with are cancelled and other completely unfunny tripe (no names mentioned) runs seemingly forever (except ""30 Rock"".  Thank god that caught on before getting axed).  This show was slow to get going, but when it hit its stride it was HILARIOUS.

I agree with the reviewer that it would be awesome if we got some unseen episodes on the DVD, but I'd be happy with anything.  I'm confused why it isn't available yet while other completely unfunny tripe is.  Ah, me.",1228780800,8,516,4.446808510638298
