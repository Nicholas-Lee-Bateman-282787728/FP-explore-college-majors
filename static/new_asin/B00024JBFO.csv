8022244,3,B00024JBFO,"The story follows one Chicago Latino gang of poor drug dealers, particularly the lives of three members who are torn between being a brother in arms gangster and taking care of people they love. The film boasts one of the worst drive-by shooting with a vintage Pontiac. The ending has a twist that wasn't well developed. There wasn't much of a story plot. 2 1/2 stars

8022249,5,B00024JBFO,"This is a very good movie and enjoyed the plot lines, it is about reality in the Hood. Wasn't sure if i would like it when ordering it based on reading about it, but it gets the intended message across.",1338163200,,202,4.075
8022250,5,B00024JBFO,"This was an excellent movie. I loved the storyline. Definitely worth checking out.  It was about a gang in Chicago, and one of the guys was ""going soft"" in their eyes because of a woman he loved. Getting out of a gang brought difficulty in his life. Again, this movie had a wonderful storyline. Check this movie out.",1110585600,8,316,4.448275862068965
