1396960,4,B000056BRU,"No one is Immortal, It's really sad Pac Had to go, He was the most Talented Modern Rapper of his day and also to This Day. No one since him Has been Good Enough. I don't like his political background, but His Talent is good.
The video shows the night of his death footage from the Casino. and some other good matters. I think one should not be proud to be A Criminal nor thug.",1244937600,,376,4.026666666666666
1396961,4,B000056BRU,"Let me start by saying I came to this documentary knowing next to nothing about Tupac Shakur, his music, or hip hop/gangsta culture.  I don't think I ever even heard of Tupac until the rumors started about how he faked his death, etc.  Thus, it should come as no surprise that I found Thug Immortal a pretty informative documentary.  I'm not sure it really captured the essence of the man, however, so I'm still on the fence as to whether the positives of his life outweigh the negatives.  A diverse range of his friends and associates talk about the man behind the thug persona, but the facts of his life make it a little hard to buy into some of what they are saying.

This isn't a biopic, as the vast majority of the material consists of interviews with those who knew Tupac from his early days in San Marin to his final days with Death Row records leading up to his murder.  As far as his childhood is concerned, all we really learn is that his mother was a major player with the Black Panthers.  The story here really starts after his move from Baltimore to California as a teen.  That's where his pursuit of a rap career really started, and I greatly enjoyed the interviews with those who knew him and rapped with him then.  Of course, most of those stories couldn't be farther away from role model material, but it's hard not to laugh with these guys about the crazy stuff that went down back then.  The most surprising thing to me was the fact that Tupac, while never one to back down from a fight, seemed to get beaten up a lot.  It's here in these formative years, though, that we see the idealistic Tupac who wants his rap to mean something and to help change for the better some of the aspects of life as he has lived it.  It is not until his portrayal of Deacon in the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juice/dp/B0000541AK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juice</a>&nbsp;that he turns more to the hard core rap and lifestyle he is best remembered for today, and several of his friends express some sadness about this change in his life, arguing that it wasn't the real Tupac.

Apart from Shock G, I had never heard of any of the rappers interviewed for this documentary, so I'm not sure how prominent any of them may have been (my knowledge of rap does not go very far beyond old school artists like Run DMC and Whodini), but the words of Death Row head honcho Suge Knight, who was almost killed himself when Tupac was gunned down, certainly leave a few lasting impressions.  For me, though, the greatest insights into the life and legacy of Tupac come from some of the journalists and writers who interviewed him, such as Malcolm Hoover of 4080 Magazine and editor Tony Patrick, who seemed to sum Tupac's life up with the following words: ""age without maturity, knowledge without wisdom, ... order turned into chaos.""

In the end, though, I don't feel as if I know very much about Tupac yet.  The limited video of the man himself included here (much of it from home movies) do not show the intellectual artist that many of his associates describe.  I certainly know little more about his music, as that is in no way a focus of this documentary.  As for his death, you'll find no conspiracy theories here, just the sad reflections of a life of great potential cut short by unknown assailants.",1219017600,,3345,4.621621621621622
1396962,1,B000056BRU,I am an ETERNAL Tupac fan and this video is about 85% interviews with people who KNEW him and 15% Pac! I would have rathered it be the other way around.,1182902400,,152,3.935483870967742
1396963,1,B000056BRU,"This video is a collection of interviews with minor characters in Tupac's life. Tupac never shows up in it! What they had to say about the performer could have been condensed into a 10 minute production--if that. Your money is much better spent buying the Tupac Resurrection video, which is really very good and actually has Tupac giving the interviews.",1109980800,9,353,4.9
1396964,1,B000056BRU,"Im a huge 2Pac fan, and Im here to tell ya' don't waste your money on this video/DVD. Its basically just no-thrills video footage of some old friends of Pacs from Baltimore, hanging around their neighborhood talking about Pac, some of their memories are funny and its amusing watching them clown around telling their stories, but most of it is entirely forgettable. Theres a few home made video segments that Pac and his boys took of each other back in the day, but nothing too great. If you're a crazy Pac fan that must own everything with his name attached to it, then go ahead and buy this Video/DVD.  But, if you're just a big fan of Pacs who wants to pick up a video/DVD about him, I recommend the Tupac Movie documentary ""Tupac/Resurrection"" which is really a must own for any real 2Pac fan.  Also although not all about just Tupac himself ""welcome to Death Row"" is interesting to watch, but do yourself a favor and save your money rather then spend it on this video/DVD. Trust me people, this video/DVD sucks, don't believe any of the reviews that said it was great or whatever. Pac himself would be the first to blast on this video/DVD saying that its garbage.",1109808000,20,1168,4.530805687203792
1396965,5,B000056BRU,"This is one of my favorites I picked at Wal-Mart. 'cuz it's the 1st documentary I ever picked and own by my man 2Pac who is an inspiration to me. I luv him the way since he started off as a rapper, a activist, and then an actor. I actually seen Welcome to Death Row, Tupac Shakur-Thug Angel:The Life of an Outlaw, Tupac:Resurrection (which I haven't seen but look forward of getting it into my collection), I mean there are a lot more documentaries I seen asides this one. Tupac will always live on in my heart and soul. Rest in peace, baby your spirit and your music lives on.",1102118400,3,577,4.254545454545455
1396966,5,B000056BRU,"This DVD is great. Portrayed is actually Tupac living the thug life. You witness his thoughts, feeling and emotions, all in one dvd. Dont worry, if you are thinking that this might be a waste of money, believe me, its not.",1080777600,3,222,4.439024390243903
1396967,5,B000056BRU,"Alright off rip let me let y'all know, I've seen this in VHS not DVD format, so as far as beyond the regular viewing I can't help y'all, but as far as the actual feature goes, this is one of the greatest documentaries on the life of Tupac Amaru Shakur I've seen.
Any fan of Tupac will greatly enjoy this, most fans of hip hop would and should enjoy it, and I've even found some people who don't like the music, who've enjoyed finding out a bit more behind the life of the ""villain"" they heard so much about in the news.
Best Points:
The interviews with people who knew THE REAL PAC, those who grew up with him in the jungle, people who knew him when he was still on the East Coast (New York and Baltimore), and those who knew him from L.A.
A point where he is walking down the streets of New York.  It gives you a slight look into his freestyling abilities, and a small confrontation with a booth owner selling a bootlegged copy of his album (I think it was Me Against The World, but don't quote me)
But all in all there is a lot of educational info on the man here, and a lot of entertaining video of himself, including random run ins with just about every class of person you can think from business mogules, to a girl working at Mc Donalds, so buy buy buy, and please Enjoy!!!...",1046822400,14,1282,4.169354838709677
1396968,4,B000056BRU,"I liked this documentary, even if it gets a bit slow at times. It tells of Tupac's hard life as a child and adolescent. He was born in New York, but the family moved around a lot, ending up in Marine county in northern California. Tupac's mother was a former Black Panther, released from prison just before giving birth to Tupac. As everybody knows, Tupac's first name is due to Leftist Tupac Amaru guerilla's fighting in Peru.
The people interviewed, with the exception of Suge Knight, are not nationally known, but there was not much one could do about it, if one wanted a thorough documentary about Tupac's life as a young adult in northern Cali. He did not hobnob with a lot of nationally known people, so you are left with interviewing those who actually knew him.
I enjoyed the documentary, especially those moments (unfortunately they were rather rare) that showed the footage of Tupac. Suge Knight gave a very good interview, and I suppose that the price of having him in this film was that neither ""Bloods,"" nor ""MOB Pirus"" are mentioned. But there is a reference to Orlando Anderson as a ""notorious Crip"" and the footage of what happened in Las Vegas following the Tyson fight, when Tupac and his friends apparently assaulted Anderson, who it is said, refused to press charges when approached by the police.
Finally, there is a story of the shooting of Tupac and his death in the hospital.
The video lacks a flashy production, and the camera work may be less than outstanding at times, but it does give you an insight into Tupac's origins and character. There are many ironies in life. In this case, a New Yorker was transplanted to northern California, ended up in prison, was bailed out, and came to represent southern California gangsta culture. There are two classes of people who occasionally grow to lofty heights in a foreign soil--great tyrants and great artists. Tupac personified the latter.",1028332800,16,1911,4.77643504531722

1397053,2,B000056BRU,"I think this dvd was so cheap to produce, you go around with a camcorder and interview guys who crossed Tupac at one time or other!
For [the money] it [isn't worth it], i was annoyed about the amount of screentime these nobodys had...
i agree with the other review, the best part of this dvd is tupac fronting a street seller, with fake Tupac tapes... wow Tupac was angry!
I wonder if he would of liked me? i don't care Tupac was an amazing actor, and who knows what he would of gone on to do?

1397057,3,B000056BRU,This video dealt mainly with Tupac life when he first got to Marin City California (Near Oakland). The documentary was both entertaining and enlightening. The production quality was subpar and some of the people interviewed seem to be unnecessary. Overall for the Tupac fan this is a must have. The footage of tupac on camcorder alone is worth the price of the DVD. If the quality and production had been better I probably would have given it a 4 and half.,1011657600,,456,4.6419753086419755
1397058,2,B000056BRU,"Hey do not buy this !!
it is the biggest waste of money ever, the picture and sound quality is real bad!! Its just a cheap way for people to make a buck out of 2pacs name.
It is rather degrading to see what people would do to earn a bit of money, Tupac was all about quality and he would only want his fans to get the best, WHICH IS NOT THIS DVD!!",1007683200,5,347,3.7027027027027026

1397060,1,B000056BRU,"What a terrible DVD, I love the man and the legend that is Tupac but this offers nothing in terms of content and the picture and sound quality is dreadful.
The Pac soundbites that come in throughout the DVD is taken from various VIBE interviews, if this is of interest then buy the book 'Tupac Amaru Shakur 1971-1996' which contains the interviews in full, is a lot better and provides far more insight into Tupacs life.
His so called friends on the DVD are all more interested in trying to take credit for Tupac and seem to all think they are better rappers despite they look like the sort of people you see hanging out at 7/11's but they are at least 30.  They all judge the value of Tupacs friendship in terms of what they could get off him for free and none of them have the aura and talent that Tupac has and continues to have.
The Suge Knight interview is ok but the DVD is just another rip off for the fans of the great man.
Whoever got paid off this needs to take a long look in the mirror, they are in danger of tarnishing Pacs image with dross like this.

1397062,5,B000056BRU,"This is the best documentary on 2pac's life.  Being a huge fan, this ranks at the top.  Unlike other videos on him, this video interviews people in the industry such as writers for magazines like 4080.  It also interviews 2pac's early friends before he became famous.  And it also has home videos of 2pac never seen before.  The only thing is that it's unauthorized by his mother.  But judging by what she puts out, it could be seen as a plus.
