8411416,5,B003ZZK2NW,Great Music. Great acting by SRK and Gayatri Joshi (debut role). One of my favorite movie of all times.,1474416000,,103,4.473684210526316
8411417,5,B003ZZK2NW,His best performance.,1459209600,,21,6.333333333333333
8411418,5,B003ZZK2NW,"Shahrukh Khan wears his roles well
This movie gave me new respect for SRK, having seen him in romantic comedies like Dilwale Dulhania le Jayenge, where his boyish charm is irresistible in the dancing and lovemaking.  Here he is at home in the Western World but falls in love with his roots, part of a common theme in Hindu movies, it appears.
It is never maudlin or mawkish, sometimes serious and sometimes wacky.  I recommend it for audiences of any age or gender.",1446768000,,465,4.590361445783133

8411420,4,B003ZZK2NW,This is a good movie with wonderful acting. It has a slow pace and style that is just not my preference. I would watch it again.,1432684800,,128,3.9615384615384617
8411421,5,B003ZZK2NW,"One of SRK's best performances. Thoughtfully portrayed movie dealing with issues of class, caste, traditions and NRI's. Very moving. Makes you think!  This is one for your  home film libraries, because you will watch it again and again.",1423094400,,236,5.184210526315789
8411422,5,B003ZZK2NW,Seen it several times already. I Loved it! Shahrukh Khan is one of best actors I have seen. The loved the story and music.,1395014400,,122,4.125
8411423,5,B003ZZK2NW,"This is such a wonderful, thought-provoking movie! It's not like the typical Bollywood movie, but is more serious and the viewer sees a sadder side of India without making the movie depressing. All the acting is great, including the main actress who is debuting in the movie. There are a few songs (not as much as usually in BW movies), but only a couple of them that I thought were really good. I bought the UTV version, which is great, no defects at all.",1332201600,2,456,4.440476190476191
