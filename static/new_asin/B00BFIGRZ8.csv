8567789,5,B00BFIGRZ8,"This second, and better, Inspector Maigret installment finds our hero going back to his hometown, meeting a rich widow with whom he'd had a romantic dalliance in his youth. The lady has been receiving written threats. Coming to her aid, Maigret stays at her decaying chateau only to get involved in a clever murder with a cast of suspects right out of Agatha Christie; the film is redolent with the atmosphere of small French village life reminiscent of Chabrol. Not a dull moment to be had.

The transfer offered by Video Dimensions is tack sharp with excellent contrast and good grays. The subtitles give you a choice of white or yellow. Hopefully, this outfit will continue to release this classic French series. I will certainly be looking forward to them.",1394668800,13,760,4.846153846153846
8567790,5,B00BFIGRZ8,"Excellent movie. Arrived fast. This was the second Maigret movie with Jean Gabin. The author of Maigret, Georges Simenon, said that after seeing Jean Gabin in the role, Maigret would always carry his face in his mind.",1385856000,8,217,4.891891891891892
