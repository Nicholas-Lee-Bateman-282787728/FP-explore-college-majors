8665178,5,B00LCFOMGK,"Each of the Athletes featured in this event, I've been watching for about three years now and they always present exciting performances individually. Together, they make for a very good, & very respectable show of their craft.

They don't display obscenity or vulgarity to compensate for talent & skill, they present a straight forward exhibition of Professional Wrestling. I highly recommend this Disc as a Starter to anyone interested in the superior presentation that is Independant Wrestling.",1435104000,,496,5.441558441558442
