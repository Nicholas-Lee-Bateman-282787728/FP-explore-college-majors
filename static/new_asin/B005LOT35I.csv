8478379,5,B005LOT35I,"My 15 month old son is obsessed with John Deere!  We have all four of the John Deere Kids videos and a couple of the On The Farm videos.  We downloaded this to his Kindle Fire and this is his new absolute favorite! It's mommy's favorite too.  It does exactly what the title states, it shows John Deere's in action.  Not a lot of unnecessary filler.  Just John Deere tractors and equipment at work.  Great videography and narrating too.  We will be getting all the videos in this series!",1468800000,,486,4.393258426966292
