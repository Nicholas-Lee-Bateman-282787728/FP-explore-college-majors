8563564,4,B00B79WKRE,"I never watched the series but was put onto the movie by a friend. It was sweet and resolved nicely (I kept waiting for the betrayal that didn't happen, thank goodness) while giving you a sense of the bittersweetness inherent in old friendships rekindled during a homecoming for the worst kind of reason.

Personally think the performances by Christopher Waun, Stephanie Long Lomenick and Josh Hodgins (in that order) carried the movie. Waun's performance is reassuring and believable as the kind of friend who has a grip on life, who holds a group together and who'll take one for the team when needed. Lomenick plays Gracie with - well, grace - and the kind of level headedness Hodgins' character needs to ground him through the turbulence of his hometown visit. Hodgins could have done with the kind of charisma Waun carries naturally but his Jackson is a solid and sympathetic character.",1372118400,,891,4.900662251655629
8563565,5,B00B79WKRE,The continuation of Jackson Horns life is about some serious life issues from two different presectives. Having heard that the story was from real life stories from the writers lives made it even better. Great local hometown talent is nice to see. The movie is a great view on a rainy afternoon.,1363046400,,295,4.6923076923076925
