8352115,5,B00266E4YO,"This series has never been made available in a Region 1 DVD for American viewers, at least not that I've ever been able to find.  I saw bits and pieces of it on television and was so impressed I went out and bought a multi-region DVD player just so I could watch the entire series.  It was well worth the cost of the series and the DVD player required to play the disks.

Clarke covers many, many intriguing topics, and while he clearly does not believe everything has an unfathomable cause, neither does he present the material with that smug look of, ""I'm reading this script, but I'm obviously far too intelligent to get sucked into this stuff the way the viewers watching it do,"" as is all too common today when network broadcasters occasionally address controversial topics.

Included in this series are segments on UFOs, mystery animals, the Mitchell-Hedges crystal skull, and a host of other intriguing subjects.  It is an older production, so don't look for whiz-bang special effects to illustrate points.  The series rests on the strength of its research, its narrative, and on Clarke's own reputation as a serious scientist and author.

For those unwilling to purchase a compatible DVD player as I did, Clarke was involved with another series called Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe.  It is much smaller and covers far fewer topics than this Mysterious World series.  But it is of comparable quality, and Amazon carries it on Region 1 formatted DVD.  I own and highly recommend both of these series.",1314489600,5,1515,4.837209302325581
8352116,5,B00266E4YO,"This has got to be the most interesting series of shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I highly recommend this dvd set for anyone with an inquisitive, intelligent mind who has an interest in mysteries of every sort. These are the kinds of shows that you will want to watch more than once and they will often inspire you to learn more about the topics that were presented. If you watch one of these shows with some friends or family, interesting conversation is sure to follow.

One word of warning: this dvd set does not play on ""standard"" (region 1) dvd players in the U.S.; fortunately, all-region dvd players are readily available on Amazon so this was not a problem for me.",1302307200,,688,4.504
8352117,4,B00266E4YO,"A two DVD ""Mysterious World"" set accomplishing 13 sequences of a Time-Life-produced program did make it to Amazon at last.

Both technically and contextually, this movie demonstrates a distance natural science did since its appearing in the eighties last century-interesting data on occurrences explained later already and some still demanding additional research, has been presented while deploying the same actors testifying to different mysteries they had supposedly witnessed, increases reviewer's inclination towards rather mocumentary than pure historical value of a sci-fi master's visual work.

Generally interesting viewing, otherwise.",1278201600,,644,6.306818181818182
