8535531,5,B00943GKWQ,"I live in Anchorage, Alaska and had some family up for a visit in June. I've always wanted to go on this trip from Anchorage to Valdez, stopping at Kennecott. I rented a 15 passenger van and spent 1 day each at Matanuska Glacier, Macarthy/Kennecott, and Valdez. It was truly a trip of a lifetime and I can't believe it took me 16 years to get around to it.

This video was like reliving the trip all over (minus the Matsu glacier and Valdez). It is really awesome and almost like being there. One thing my parents were wanting was a memento of the trip in video particularly McCarthy and Kennecott where we spent 1.5 days and was the highlight of the trip.

In the title of the video I said that it undersold Kennecott, what I meant was from the cover and description I didn't think they would spend much time at all on that area, I was more than pleasantly surprised as they went into great detail and that was the highlight of the video.

So, in summary, great video for those just wanting to experience the area for the first time or reminisce on past trips, also it would be great for a trip planning video.",1376956800,3,1111,4.30622009569378
