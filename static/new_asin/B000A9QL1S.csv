8076485,4,B000A9QL1S,"This is a two disc set. Disc one contains the movies ""Count Dracula and His Vampire Brides"" (aka ""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"") (1974), ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964), and ""Fangs of the Living Dead"" (aka ""Malenka"") (1969). Disc Two has ""Grave of the Vampire"" (1972) and ""The Vampire Happening"" (aka ""Gebissen wird nur nachts"") (1971). The quality of the transfers is average - there are visible scratches from the original prints. There are minimal extra features - a couple of bio pages and a stills gallery. But overall it's a nice collection of some decent movies at a bargain price.",1134345600,8,587,4.764705882352941
