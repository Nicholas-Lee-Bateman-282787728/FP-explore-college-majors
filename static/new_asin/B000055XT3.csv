7931219,5,B000055XT3,"Hip-Hop Rock's inventors that spawned bands like Kid Rock, Limp Bizkit, Faith No More, and Linkin Park. The combination of metal and rap or hip-hop is very potent and appeals to a wide fanbase. Nothing is harder than hardcore rap mixed with NWA/Public Enemy like lyrics. When Anthrax and Public Enemy performed ""Bring Tha' Noise"", people went hoarse from screaming it in the audience! Without Run-DMC, there would be none of the bands I have listed other than NWA and Public Enemy around today. Period.",1283126400,,502,4.91764705882353

7931221,5,B000055XT3,Excellent product. It has all of the best hits on it. The documentary is interesting. Very fine product.,1231286400,,104,4.833333333333333
7931222,4,B000055XT3,"Great stuff here.  The dvd is pretty bare bones as far as extras.. you only have a static discography and an extremely brief documentary on Profile Records..
Anyway, MOST of their video hits are here.. People who remember the DOWN WITH THE KING cd may notice that ""Ooh, Whatcha Gonna Do"" is not here..
Also, ""sucker mc's"" and ""it's like that(remix)"" are certainly NEW videos, but technically, don't feature the band..
visually, you can't help but notice that hip-hop videos have gotten much better budgets since Run DMC's heyday (witness the head-swapping graphic on ""rock box""..), but hey, the music is still as good as it gets...",1050710400,4,631,4.897196261682243
7931223,4,B000055XT3,"If u are a RUN DMC fan this one is a no brainer. These videos are all top quality. You are getting what you pay for. The videos are complete. Plus u get a video that you probably haven't seen. Its for the Jason Nevins club remix of ""It's Like That"" (Jason Nevins is an English Dj who's remixes of Run Dmc classics can be found on the UK version of their greatest hits album) This video features two b-boy/girl crews battlin old skool in a wherehouse...dope.  This dvd also features a ""mini-documentary"" which is a worthless Priority self-promo. But that aside this is a must have for RUN DMC fans. (Remember Penn and Teller in the ""It's tricky"" video, or the countless cameos from rappers in ""Down with the King?"" bet you've never seen Kriss Kross and Eazy E in the same place before.)  Would've gotten 5 stars but the video for ""My addidas"" is missing.  They be illin.",981417600,8,869,4.41875
