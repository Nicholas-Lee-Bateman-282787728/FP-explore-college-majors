8511735,5,B0077EMR2G,"Truth in 24 is a documentary for racing fans and novices alike.  This fascinating movie follows the Audi Teams as the try to win and unprecedented 8th Le Mans title.  From the beginning you are sucked into the story.  Audi was the first to bring a diesel engine to the race, and it was at triumph.  Now 3 years later, they are facing stiff competition from Peugeot's new diesel entry, which is a faster car, but that is only a part of what makes a winning team.

The directors Keith Cossrow and Bennett Viseltear do a fantastic job building suspense for the match up.  They give us a little history of the Le Mans, and through archival footage show us how this grueling 24 hour race is not just about the fastest car, but about the driver's skill, the engineers who designed and built the car, and the pit crew who keep it running, and perform repairs at break neck speed.  It is clear that Audi not only has their world class drivers, but the team-focus, practice and work ethic that is the keys to the previous success.

Although anyone can google the results of this race, that it besides the point.  Cossrow and Viseltear make us part of the Audi team as we join in the thrill of the race.",1380758400,4,1193,4.361990950226244
