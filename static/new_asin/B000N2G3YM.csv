8174036,5,B000N2G3YM,Ask yourself one question. How do you know where you are going if you don't know where we have been? Within this movie are some hidden secrets that most will not recognize...,1514419200,,174,4.46875
8174037,2,B000N2G3YM,"Jim Crandall or Callie (James Britton) gets shot with a mini-ball. Majorette, Margie De Mar (Linda Jenkins) disappears. Reporter Jim Crandall (James Britton) and inept night club singer Sandy De Mar (Ann Pellegrino), whom happens to be the sister of  Margie, search for the missing Margie near an old Dallas farm house and end up in the lab of mad scientist Professor Ernest Von Hauser (Jack Herman.)  Will they ever be seen again or will the mad scientist, using his time machine, bring back his friend Schicklgruber from the past and restore the rightful order of history.

The acting is hokey; it is probably on purpose. The background music will grate on your nerves. Shot in black and white. The accents are east Texas so we know it was made in Dallas and not Ft. Worth.

The only redeeming portion of the film is the mad scientist who takes more time than usual to explain Einstein and does not over act the part. Is he wearing Tom Ford glasses?

We are left with these thoughts:

8174038,2,B000N2G3YM,"THE YESTERDAY MACHINE begins with a series of shots that show a man working on his car while a young woman twirling a baton stands nearby, grinding her hips to a rock and roll beat as she spins the silver shaft.  Then she opens her mouth, and her Texass accent is such that it could peel your socks off.  The duo decide to seek help from a nearby farm house, but unexpectedly run into two Confederate soliders!  The boy is shot and the girl disappears!  Gee, what's going on?  A total waste of your time, that's what.

The story continues as a newspaper reporter and a really bad lounge singer go in search of the missing girl and find themselves confronted by a Nazi who has invented a time machine to bring back Hitler.  The performances are ... well, let's just say that Ed Wood's actors were Oscar-winning in comparison.  The men talk with terse lips.  The mad scientist draws diagrams on a chalk board.  The women swoon.  An Egyptian woman in bad costume comes to the rescue.  And so on.

Now and then you come across a bad movie that is bad in an entertaining sort of way, and to a certain extent that is true of THE YESTERDAY MACHINE.  The opening scenes of the baton twirler are a scream, and the cast is so ludicrously bad that it's hard to supress a snicker, especially when they are tossing off some of the worst dialogue since MANOS, HANDS OF FATE.  Even so, there's a limit to the amusement to be had in this film, and I paid for each chuckle with a tooth-grinding moment.  If you're really into obscure and very bad movies, this one is for you--but all others should look away.

8174039,3,B000N2G3YM,"We have here a privately-manufactured DVD. My experience with barebones DVD-Rs has been satisfactory, as I'm not interested in commentary, deleted scenes, other bonus features, that is, stuff these discs don't offer. Transfers are ""best available source"" and quality can vary from very good to only fair. Of greatest concern is no mfr. ID in Product Details.

THE YESTERDAY MACHINE is an intentionally campy film sure to amuse all fans of vintage low budget quickie sci-fi. It's about a post-WWII German physicist (Jack Herman in an over-the-top-of-Mt.-Everest performance) who has --big-- plans. From his  laboratory hidden in a Dallas area farmhouse, Prof. von Hauser hopes to restore Der F&uuml;hrer by conquering the 4th dimension! Meanwhile, he kidnaps a high school majorette just before the big game and the cops come looking for her.

8174040,3,B000N2G3YM,"WOW! Some forgotten 60s films should really stay lost, but this homemade in Texas movie should have gotten released somehow - it's fairly well-done technically but the sci-fi plot about a mad scientist hoping to bring back Adolph Hitler with the aid of a time machine is wildly over-the-top, as is the performance of the actor playing the scientist. Delightful! I'd heard of the film over the years and never hoped to see it until noticing it was now on DVD. Held my interest beginning to end thanks to its earnest cast of mainly amateur actors, incredibly unlikely plot and Tim Holt(!) playing a cop. See it if you've ever loved a drum majorette!",1266969600,12,647,4.684210526315789
