8066751,4,B0009UD6M0,Slapstick is a must see for fans of Jerry Lewis. I really cared for the misunderstood twins. The moral of the story is that you shouldn't judge people by thier looks. Many people feel threatened by highly intelligent people and only want to make themselves look good. This film had a few funny moments. What made the film was the heartfelt banter between the twins and the humor of Pat Morita. Highly recommended for fans of sci fi. Fans of Jerry Lewis won't be dissapointed. This is a highly original film.,1368144000,4,507,4.582417582417582
8066752,1,B0009UD6M0,"Some films deserve to be lost. This disastrous 1982 ""adaptation"" of Kurt Vonnegut's novel sat on the shelf for two years. ""Slapstick of Another Kind"" constitutes a painful embarrassment, with a good cast wallowing in cinematic ineptitude. Barely released and largely forgotten. Extra Trivia: Jerry Lewis earned a Razzie nomination for Worst Actor.",1365120000,2,347,5.566037735849057
8066753,2,B0009UD6M0,"'Slapstick of another kind' is a movie that could have been good if it took itself a little bit more seriously, or didn't rely so much on childish behaviour and special effects.

The plot is so hard to follow and, well, it's not as if the movie really cares about the plot too much, rather, it relies on some childishness from Jerry Lewis, that is 'Wilbur' and his sister 'Eliza', played by Madeline Kahn. Actually, I was enjoying the movie more before you meet 'Wilbur' and 'Eliza' - the Chinese are funny in this movie, and it was interesting to see a movie from 30 years ago reflect today's political climate.

Once you get into the laborious details about the twins and their 'eccentric-looking-but-not-funny' carers, the movie is rather dull.",1345593600,,747,4.7384615384615385
8066754,1,B0009UD6M0,"I saw part of this film on TV years ago.  Jerry Lewis should have known better than to make fun of retarded people, as he has done in this film.  Both Jerry and Madeline Kahn play mentally challenged offspring.  It is so horrible to watch.  They wear wigs, make stupid noises.  It's embarrassing.  I shut it off -- I couldn't take it anymore.

Guess what: I'm a rabid Jerry Lewis fan.",1330128000,2,384,4.323943661971831
8066755,1,B0009UD6M0,"I am a huge Jerry Lewis fan and this one is definitely not worth the time it takes to watch.  Save yourself the trouble because you sit through it knowing his reputation (expecting so much better) and at the end of all of the nonsense all you can say is, ""Really?  I mean, really?""  What a waste of film.  There are so many movies he did that are soooo much better!",1322438400,3,365,4.098591549295775

8066757,1,B0009UD6M0,"Based on the Kurt Vonnegut novel ""Slapstick - Or Lonesome No More,"" SLAPSTICK OF ANOTHER KIND was a box office bomb filmed in 1982 but not released in the U.S. until two years later. Star Jerry Lewis was nominated for the Worst Actor Golden Raspberry for his efforts here. Orson Welles, scraping the bottom of a distinguished career, vocalized the ""Father of the Aliens.""

SYNOPSIS--

A beautiful and renowned couple (Lewis and Kahn) give birth to mentally deficient twins who look like their famous parents, with one exception: the kids grow up to have oversized heads. It turns out they were just pretending to be stupid, for when they touch heads their intellectual abilities are second to none. After a former Chinese ambassador (Morita) fails to convince parents and President (Backus) that the twins could potentially save our planet, an alien with Orson Welles' voice appears. He explains that the gifted pair are HIS children sent to Earth to solve all our problems, but since we Earthlings couldn't cope with such immense brains, they were going back to their home planet.

Jery Lewis rebounded nicely with his next film, Martin Scorsese's THE KING OF COMEDY, which actually appeared in the U.S. before ""Slapstick."" Here, Jerry is a famous late night talk show host who's stalked by a talentless wannabe stand-up comic (Robert DeNiro).
