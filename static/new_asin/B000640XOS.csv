To make matters worse, this region is controlled by one of ZAFT's most elite commanders, the brilliant but somewhat eccentric ""Desert Tiger"", Andy Waltfield. While he pays as much attention to his prized coffee recipes as his battle strategies, Waltfield and his forces are every bit as formidable an enemy as the Le Creuset Team, especially with their quadrupedal BuCUE mobile mobile suits, which are ideally suited for desert combat. Fortunately, Kira is also reuinited with the mysterious Cagalli, who since escaping Heliopolis has joined a local resistance group, ""Desert Dawn"". Will these newfound allies be enough to overcome the Desert Tiger? Buy the DVD and find out.",1100044800,3,920,5.440559440559441
