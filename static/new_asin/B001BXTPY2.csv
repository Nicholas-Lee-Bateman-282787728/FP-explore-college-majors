3499822,5,B001BXTPY2,"LOVE THE SHOW ON TV AND LOVE THE DVDS. IT IS NICE TO WATCH SOMETHING I WATCH WHEN I HOME. I AM DEPLOYED TO IRAQ,",1244073600,2,112,3.52
3499823,5,B001BXTPY2,"This is a great show. Bear shows you different ways to survive in the wilderness or on the beach or in the mountains or the desert or where ever they decide to drop him off, all of which are beautifully shot countrysides. Yes he has a camera crew, yes hes is given some info and help in different situations for him to present to you. so if you don't like that you might not be into this show some people compare him to survivor man Les Stroud which is another one of my favorite shows although Man vs. Wild is a more action packed, because he doesn't have to spend his time lugging  around camera gear and trying to get good shots of himself doing these things.",1242432000,6,662,4.21259842519685
3499824,5,B001BXTPY2,"Apparently the survival experts have spoken and MAN VS WILD = SUPERMEGA FAKE.  That's alright with me; I am an idiot who enjoys ""dumbed down"" productions such as Man vs. Wild moreso than I enjoy watching Survivorman, a show in which the adventurer (i.e. Les) sits around a campfire for 7 days while he plays his harmonica and does nothing else.  Survivor experts are we???...yeah...ok.  I guess Surviorman is one who brings the excitement of hiking to the screen-he walks to a spot, camps in a spot and does not move.

Bear Grylls (or should I say the infamous Ed...) may camp in ""hotels,"" he may eat pieces of steak instead of badgers, he may jump through sheets of ice into a secretly hidden hot-tub beneath the surface of a ""frozen lake,"" he may even use ""smoke machines"" to simulate the gaseous, boiling properties of lava, but he nevertheless is more of a survival expert than you and me.  Any man or woman who goes into nature and puts his/herself into situations in which he/she shows inexperienced outdoorsman how to escape quicksand, animal threats, etc. has my respect.  I suppose the beetle grubs he eats are fake as well....  After using these techniques he displayed for creating compasses, building camps, and even learning of the different types of insects and plants that are edible in regions I myself have visited (i.e. the Moab desert and the Badlands), there is no doubt in my mind that the things he teaches are relevant and useful.  While he may not camp through the entire night or eat every single disgusting insect/animal upon which he appears to dine, he nevertheless shows people what to do in moments of emergency.

I have faith in Bear/Ed, his camera crew, and the survival experts with whom he explores.  While I do not doubt that some things are staged (i.e. the disclaimer at the beginning of the show states this), there is no way one can completely discount the show, even if that SURVIVAL EXPERT does not agree with the techniques he employs. Further, I have a hard time believing that the Discovery Channel would allow a show to air on their TV station that bore absolutely NO truth and applicability.  That is simply ignorant.  Bear Grylls is a genius and he should not have to suffer verbal abuse from naysaying simpletons.

Do not allow the negative, pessimistic reviews from those angry with and at life deter you from purchasing this DVD.  Buy this DVD and you will know how to survive; more importantly, buy this DVD and you will also know what it means to be human.  I will cease writing now, as I aim to write a review and not an essay.",1232928000,50,2580,4.62719298245614
3499825,5,B001BXTPY2,great for the price. 13 episodes. and as a bonus there's bears mission everest. great buy.,1232236800,12,90,4.6875
3499826,5,B001BXTPY2,"Man vs Wild is not Survivor Man. Bear is not out to survive the wilds and by doing so prove to you that it can be done, instead he shows you how it can be done.

This show sets up for you some techniques to help you in a survival situation, I don't know why most people can't get that and think that Bear should be doing the same thing Survivor Man is doing.

I enjoyed this season because it seems that everything Man vs. Wild was supposed to do in season 1, is done very well in this season. I really felt I was learning something from this season instead of just watching a man survive while filming himself (survivor man).

This season really gets in the grove of teaching you what you can do, what you can build, and of course, what you can eat in order to survive if you found yourself in that type of situation.",1231977600,5,818,4.1
3499827,4,B001BXTPY2,"Entertaining show with some interesting survival tidbits.  Forget all the ""fake"" hype, all of these shows have some production value-added, otherwise they'd be so boring and unappealing they'd never get past one pilot episode.",1231459200,2,226,5.647058823529412
3499828,1,B001BXTPY2,"Bear Grylls has a somewhat entertaining show but it is completely worthless from a survival standpoint. I do not like the Title ""Man vs. Wild""? There are enough people going against the natural world already. That title gives nature a bad name, like it is something you must fight against. The man has admitted to staging scenes of the show and staying in hotel rooms, to me, that discredits almost anything he has to say about natural living. If you are only interested in entertainment, then this show deserves about three stars. However, if you are interested in learning survival information, or not interested in seeing a fool run around in the woods, I would highly recommend Survivor Man. Also, any of Tom Brown's field guides are great for a person who is truly interested in survival and not just cheap entertainment.

Also, NEVER drink your urine as Bear tells you to do. That ""survival advice"" can easily get you killed.",1230940800,9,931,4.782608695652174
3499829,4,B001BXTPY2,"Despite all of the controversy surrounding the show, I think season 2 is great.  Note that if you get it through the Discovery Store, like I did, its been available since August.  In any event, if you take the show for what it is and not for absolute authenticity, then you will probably like it as much as I did.  If you are dead set on Bear spending the night in every camp he builds or every encounter being total coincidence and never staged, then maybe this isn't for you.  I personally would rather see a staged event to demonstrate techniques rather than an uneventful walk through the forest!  For the amazing landscapes the show offers, the fast paced adventure and seeing Bear eat snakes, worms, spiders and all the rest, it will always be worth it to me.

On a side note, I thought season one was slightly better (the first released set, not the edited set that comes with 2 discs in the same package!) based on more varying places all over the world, and more consistent format.  Still tho, this is a great buy and I hope we will see more of Bear Grylls.",1230854400,9,1066,4.380710659898477
3499830,5,B001BXTPY2,Great show! Bear Grylls is a very likeable host and always willing to put himself is dangerous circumstances for the viewers to learn how to deal with these situations. Great for learning as well as entertainment. I highly recommend it.,1463961600,,236,4.925
3499831,5,B001BXTPY2,"I have three young sons who love the outdoors.  We watch a new episode or more as a family every weekend!  Never gets olds.  Bear eats some things that you would never consider eating, but it sure makes getting the kids to eat their dinners a lot easier.",1463270400,,254,4.25

3499835,5,B001BXTPY2,"In defense of Bear Grylls and the show he hosted for 6 seasons I would like to say that I like this show very much and it has a considerable amount of valuable survival knowledge imparted to the viewer. It is very adventurous, exciting and you get to see different and exotic places around the world. Although a certain amount of what happens is planned before shooting Bear does demonstrate lots of valuable survival techniques and discusses many helpful tricks, tips and warnings about the place he is in whether it`s the jungle, desert, woodland or snow covered arctic. There is a real life story of a boy who got lost for days and would have died before help arrived but he survived because of some survival tips he learned from Bear Grylls on the show before he got into this situation. I understand that some things where added and done for show and entertainment because ratings are the first priority. But despite this, this show is definitely worth watching and owning and if you don`t know anything about survival you will definitely be better off having watched it and learned from it. I think most people know that climbing a mountain or repelling down a 200-300 foot cliff is not safe or possible for most people among other things. If you want more realistic and reality based survival shows check out Dual Survival seasons 1 and 2 with Cody Lundin and Dave Canterberry and Man Woman Wild with Mykel Hawk and his wife.",1458604800,,1432,4.641732283464567

I really enjoyed the audiobook but came to associate him with the narrators voice and was a little shocked by how tiny his voice is in the show.

Whether it's eating something truly disgusting or finding shelter, he is as good as it gets when the survival of hope is the issue. I like they way the camera and production crews are included in the handling of each season's problems.

3499868,5,B001BXTPY2,Another fun season of Bear Grylls on his globe hopping survival tests.

3499870,5,B001BXTPY2,"This is one of the best seasons of Man vs. Wild and one that fans of Bear Grylls will enjoy a lot.  I am one of those fans.  I understand that Bear is not a survival instructor.  He takes a lot of risks that are not advisable for someone who is merely trying to survive.  This is what gives his show its high entertainment value.  That being said, there are a lot of Bear-haters who trash everything he does.  These people will obviously not approve of much of what Bear does in Season Two. Speaking of which...

In Season Two, Bear travels to Patagonia, Siberia, Panama, Namibia, Zambia, Panama, Indonesia, and the Sahara. Thus, as with any good survival program, you get a taste of some very different environments--from very cold to very hot; from very wet to very dry.  It includes a few of my all-time favorite episodes (""Castaway"" and ""Namibia"") and few episodes that I intentionally skip over.

Season Two is unique among the seasons of Man vs. Wild in that there are several two-part episodes.  In these, he typically meets up with indigenous people in the second part and learns some survival techniques directly from them.  Examples of this are his porcupine hunting expedition with the San Bushmen of Namibia and his attempt to eat a goat testicle presented to him by a Berbers of North Africa.  This feature of Season Two makes it all the more worth watching.

This is good entertainment for almost anyone of any age.  Bear goes to a lot of interesting places, eats a lot of disgusting things, and performs his usual daredevil feats of climbing, skydiving, and so on.  I would consider this one of , if not the, best of the Man vs. Wild seasons.  It certainly has a ""do not try this at home"" element that keeps it from being a true survival program (to purists of the genre, at least) but it is definitely great Bear for Bear fans--but not Bear fans only.",1372982400,,1867,4.528358208955224

This is an amazingingly skilled and highly trained human being whose experience in the United Kingdom Special Forces Selection has made him who he is. All of his experiences are real and unfabricated. He is trained for survival at all costs, and rescue teams are on stand-by should something go dreadfully wrong for him and his crew. In case some of you are unfamiliar with this bit of trivia, Bear Grylls learned to climb and sail from his father at an early age. He earned a second dan black belt in Shotokan karate as a teenager. He now practices Yoga and Ninjutsu. He also became involved in scouting, beginning at age eight, as a cub scout. He speaks English, Spanish, and French. Grylls is Christian, describing his faith as the ""backbone"" in his life. In other words, he is no joker! God bless and long live Bear Grylls!",1259712000,3,895,4.530864197530864
