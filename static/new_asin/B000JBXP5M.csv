2670312,4,B000JBXP5M,"This is basically a lighthearted action fanservice anime about how a busty blond senshi (gun expert) Rushuna Tendo is traveling around the world spreading love and peace to the world without resorting to violence--at least tries to, anyway. And along the way she accompanies a bumbling mercenary swordsman Yajiro, and an obnoxious balloon maker Mikan to join with her along the ride.

I'll keep it short and sweet: I seem to have an unhealthy love for this show, mainly because of how laughably stupid it truly is. The team I mentioned above is one the oddest pairings I've seen in a long time, and the action has a dumb campy charm to it, showcasing the most illogical reloading technique imaginable provided by Rushuna. And did I mention this show provides some light fanservice? (Rushuna has a strange addiction to taking baths, so the minute you hear her say ""Oh, I'm all sweaty."", you'll sense a bath scene coming along.)

Goofy elements aside, it also has some positive elements as well. Rushuna and Yajiro, despite their problems, are still likable characters (Just don't expect a love story between the two.), the theme song is so darn catchy, and the animation is pretty decent for a TV show. Also at times when an action scene is not goofy, it's a decent one.

Of the 12 episodes, if I have to choose a personal favorite, it'd definitely be Episode 8's ""An Enemy From The Past: Teppa Eizen"", mainly because of the title character himself. The closet pervert Teppa's reaction to when he accidentally squeezes Rushuna's boob always sends me dying in laughter every time, making this character rank high on my list of favorite anime perverts.

Bottom line: If you're in the mood for some dumb, stupid entertainment, this anime's worth checking out. I know it's a goofy show, but then again, denying my enjoyment for this series would be like criticizing the sheer stupidity with the Adam West Batman show; It's not SUPPOSED to be taken seriously, you just enjoy the show for what it is.",1257724800,,1993,4.784883720930233
2670313,1,B000JBXP5M,"Yes I'm a perv that's why I continued watching it but I originally watched it without knowing what it really was about.

To the reviewer that said its like trigun but with breasts. This is no Trigun, don't insult trigun by comparing this to it. Trigun is by no manner a flawless, top of the line anime but it had a lot more quality in it. The humor and gun battle was much better. This anime is only for people that have nothing to do but watch animated women. Anime like this, btw, insult women in general. No natural woman is built like that, but that's what most animes are. Just wanted to clarify that.

The action scenes are very lame and even their pervy scenes are lame. Nothing great. This anime actually deserves a 2 or maybe 2.5 but I'm trying to balance the score out. I'm sorry, but this anime doesn't excite, either for the pervy minded or even if you just want to watch it for the gun battles. Trigun gets you connected to the character, this is just blah.",1254355200,2,970,4.295081967213115
2670314,5,B000JBXP5M,Grenadier is a really nice series and is funny and fast enough to keep my attention.  I love sexy comedies and this is one of my top favorites with Love Hina and Tenchi Muyo.  Not everyones cup of tea I'm afraid though.  But if you need something with a sexy heroine and a clutsy guy who likes her this should be a good addition to your collection.,1216944000,6,348,4.164179104477612
2670315,5,B000JBXP5M,"I recieved this series from a friend as a birthday present. I'd been meaning to get it for awhile but was pleasently surprised to get it as a gift. My friends have to check with me when purchasing anime for me or themselves. My personal anime collection is REALLY LARGE, so they need to know if a series is good or if I have it. As for the series the opening music really took hold of me. I really like the opening song, and I like the opening song it's a good bet bet I'll like the series. Past examples are please teacher, loved the song and got the soundtrack. And the bubblegum crisis ova. Konya wa hurricane is my favorite japanes rock song and I have BOTH soundtracks for the bubblegum crisis ova. Back to the actual review, the cast of characters involve a smiling blonde woman with a gun and a very cynical swordsman that travel together after achance encounter. It's a classic story lead duo encounter evil, pick up a child sidekick. Go on a jorney to clear their names encounter friends turned enemies fromm their pasts etc. Iloved the voice acting and thought the main villian is trully great with his goals and his old european otfit with the ceramic mask. This a fun light hearted series with drama, comedy, and suspense. And like a lot of people say it's trigun with a female lead. I really enjoyed this series and would recomend it to anyone.",1212969600,,1357,4.432
2670316,5,B000JBXP5M,"Grenadier is a great 12 episode series. Recommended for those who like  action, a good story, and a decent ending resolution.",1206403200,5,125,4.9523809523809526
2670317,3,B000JBXP5M,"To properly enjoy Grenadier, I would simply rehash a phrase used many-a-times by other reviewers to describe various Anime series: ""Leave your brain at the door"".

If one were to deviate from simply enjoying the visuals by contemplating the story, characters, theme, etc; your brain might eventually cause you to regret your purchase.

""Why did I purchase Grenadier?""  ""Why does this happen when this doesn't?""  ""What kind of outfit is that?!""  ""Is that even a logical way to reload a pistol?!""  Thoughts like these might ensue.

For what it's worth, Grenadier is a very nicely animated and entertaining series; though I personally find it as standard fare for Japanimation, with storylines including: revenge, save-a-town, badguy-turn-good, rescue-a-princess, etc.

I would not recommend, nor persuade anyone from adding Grenadier to their own personal collection.  Although I do have to admit, the Opening Theme for Grenadier is a sweet melody...  As I watched through all the episodes, I never skipped past the opening once.

As a final note, Grenadier is not recommended for viewing by youngsters, or those sensitive to suggestive themes.  There is no actual nudity, but it doesn't shy away from convenient cover-ups.",1202342400,4,1221,5.302083333333333
2670318,5,B000JBXP5M,"Good DVD series. Some comic humor, some serious overtones and a Girl with ""Big Guns"" what more can you ask for in an anime. Hey that reloading sequence that defies the laws of physics is worth it alone.",1178150400,11,202,4.342105263157895
2670319,4,B000JBXP5M,"A slapstick humor that, when combined with a few good fight animations, makes this a really good fix for boredom.",1177113600,3,113,4.7

8150035,4,B000JBXP5M,"What happens when you mix a samurai anime with a gunslinger show with fan service? You get the anime, Grenadier. This anime is kind of like Trigun or Rurouni Kenshin, in the way that the main character is an extremely powerful warrior, but absolutely refuses to kill anyone, even those that try to kill her. The difference between those other shows and this show is that the main character is a young woman with very large assets. This anime is a fan service series, but not as heavy as shows like Queen's Blade or Ikki Tousen. Although the main character does seem to take a bath in almost every episode.

The main character, Rushuna Tend, a blonde haired woman who meets the swordsman, Yajir Kojima, in a rather peculiar way in the first episode. He is trying to escape from samurai, and meets her while she is bathing. She helps him by hiding him under her very large breasts while she is still in the hot spring. The enemy ask her about him, but she plays ignorant, and Yajiro is indebted to her service. They start travelling together, but meet a lot of enemies on their way. Rushuna is an expert with a gun, but feels that fighting in not the only way to resolve their problems. She believes that conflict can be resolved with a smile, and sometimes a hug. This sounds preposterous, but it does work more times than one would believe. Don't worry; there is still a lot of gunfights and action in the show.

As mentioned above, this is a fan service show, so if you are against women with large breasts or women bathing, then you may want to look elsewhere. As I recall, there is no actual nudity in this series. The series would of been more interesting if there was more than just 12 episodes. There is also a character, Mikan Kurenai, who appears about half way into the show, and she is just too young to really do anything in the series. She is not the only character who does this as well because there is another character, Teppa Aizen, who appears about two thirds of the way into the series, and is deprived of getting proper appreciation in this series. Its as if the series could of used other characters more often, but it mostly relies on using the two main characters.

Despite this show's shortcomings, it is still an enjoyable anime to watch every now and then if you like samurai-fan service shows with both guns and swords.",1381708800,,2346,4.4766355140186915
8150036,4,B000JBXP5M,"Aside from the nearly required stare-fest at a couple of the biggest boobs in anime, Grenadier is a fun show all around.  Rushuna is a wonderfully generous, gun wielding defender of everything good & just. And she has a fancy way of reloading her 6-shooter!  And while she's 98% of the time in a delicately balanced good mood she definitely has a streak of seriousness you don't want to be on the receiving end of if at all possible.

All in all, the series isn't one I'd count in my ""top 10 ever"" - but it's one I wanted to own simply because it's a truly fun watch.  I think most will feel the same.  No full gambit of every emotion entwined with each scene - but definitely a series you can pop in anytime and have a chuckle and an enjoyable watch!  ""Grenadier"" is absolutely worth the addition to any collection!",1377302400,,816,4.3355263157894735
8150037,3,B000JBXP5M,"The basic premise of this Grenadier is a gunslinger advocating peace and refusing to kill anyone. The beginning episodes show off the main character's marksmanship well and got my hopes high for the rest of the series. Unfortunately, all the fights are either against opponents who have zero chance of actually meaningfully fighting back or against someone with a cheesy wacky power who will then give up fighting after their weakness is finally exposed (except the fight at the end against another grenadier toward the end which was absolutely awesome). If they had edited this down to a six-episode OVA it could have been great.  Grenadier is good enough to pass the time and you may go back to re-watch the highlights, but is ultimately a poor copy of Trigun which is an all-around better anime.",1261353600,,798,4.867647058823529
