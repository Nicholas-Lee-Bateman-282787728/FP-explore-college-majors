5192243,4,B008YV11JQ,"A-cappella nerds are run amok in the new movie ""Pitch Perfect"", and how wonderful it is in this day and age of studio doctored album releases that somebody would have the keen sense to make such a movie. Sure, there's the television show ""Glee"" that explores the same thing, but the television show ""Glee"" is studio doctored a-cappella. The beauty of the human voice without instruments or synthesizers is truly a lost art form and ""Pitch Perfect"" represents well.

The best part about ""Pitch Perfect"" and the a-cappella that it demonstrates is the realization that Anna Kendrick (Up in the Air, 50/50) can really sing among other things. One scene in particular stands out where she auditions for the a-cappella group, `the Bellas'. In the scene, she creates music with her hand and a cup while singing. Brittany Snow as well showed off her singing ability in the television show ""American Dream"" but here, she hits it out of the park even more. Then there is Rebel Wilson, who plays Fat Amy. You may remember her from the smash hit ""Bridesmaids"" from last year. She adds the humor and spice to the group.

""Pitch Perfect"" isn't without criticism in its predictability. Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton recently teamed up for a more wholesome film called ""Joyful Noise"" in which a group of choir singers are trying to compete in a national competition and need to spice up their routine. You get the same storyline with ""Pitch Perfect"". Given though, ""Pitch Perfect"" is by far the superior film of the two. The comedy is better and the a-cappella is real and well constructed.

The a-cappella in ""Pitch Perfect"" is the film. Director Jason Moore who knows a thing or two about music, having directed ""Avenue Q"" on broadway, knew it had to be great. The storyline wasn't going to be the selling point. He also knows a thing or two about what young teen audiences want as well, with a few directing credits on the WB and CW networks. There are many highlights throughout the film and I even found some of the musical numbers in the middle of the film more compelling than the finale.

""Pitch Perfect"" is a combination of a lot of films, but the good thing is, all those films are good ones. Movies like ""Mean Girls"", ""Bridesmaids"", ""Joyful Noise"", ""Bring it On"" and oh, I'd have to mention ""Glee"" even though Glee is sort of fake a-cappella, are all inspirations for what turned out to be a movie with a routine storyline that you can't take your eyes off of. The script is tight, eventful and always interesting. The humor is good. Everything blended together to lock you the audience into your seat for a fun and toe-tapping good time.",1349913600,6,2634,4.670258620689655
5192244,5,B008YV11JQ,This movie was amazing and I strongly feel that if you are not sure if you want to see it... DO! It may be the best movie you have ever seen! I know I am buying it! It was sooooooooooooo funny and just AMAZING!!!!!!!!,1349827200,,217,3.9545454545454546
5192245,2,B008YV11JQ,"The lovely Anna Kendrick (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) stars in Pitch Perfect, a film produced by actress Elizabeth Banks (People Like Us) that could be the product of a hook-up between television's ""Glee"" and the Scary Movie franchise. It starts off with an unexpected gag (quite literally) and stumbles along for nearly two hours, trying to figure out what kind of movie it wants to be. It has romance, a few heartwarming moments (mostly at the end), some scenes that try to be comedy but aren't funny, and some halfway decent tunes. It won't have you running home to purchase the soundtrack, though, although the ""Cups"" scene is certainly worthy of mention. It certainly does not compare to ""Glee"" and seems to be an obvious attempt to cash in on a cash cow.

So the plot goes like this. Snobby Aubrey (Anna Camp) and likeable Chloe (Brittany Snow) need to recruit girls for their school's acapella girl group, the Barden Bellas, in order to beat rival boy group the Treblemakers at next year's competition. It seems that the unlikely scenario has occurred in which their entire group, aside from Aubrey and Chloe, have graduated. Beca (Kendrick) is new to the school, and she desires a career in making music. She doesn't want to be a singer - she literally wants to make music. She regularly combines samples on her laptop to create mash-ups that aren't anything special. She is told she is ""very good"", but her songs beg to differ.

Beca shares a room with stereotypical Asian roommate Kimmy Jin (Jinhee Joung) who, no joke, is tinkering with a gold Bonsai tree when Beca arrives. Beca is the typical disgruntled child of a typical broken home with a throwaway dad who she typically blames for the divorce. Yawn. On her first day, Beca has a run-in with Jesse (Skylar Astin), who is the obvious love interest. Despite appearing like a jerk while attempting to be endearing, Jesse becomes more likeable throughout the film. Luke (Freddie Stroma) is Jesse and Beca's boss at the college radio station where they end up landing jobs without being interviewed, and we don't see nearly enough of this genetically superior specimen. What follows amongst the three of them is a love triangle so subtle that it would be undetected and forgettable if Jesse didn't keep reminding us of it with his jealousy over Beca's assumed fawning.

Benji (Ben Platt), Jesse's weird roommate (as we're reminded multiple times), is the kid you try to avoid in the high school halls while not realizing that he is just ""sweet and misunderstood."" You hope he doesn't kill himself halfway through the film. He is obsessed with magic and idolizes the Treblemakers to a creepy level, but it's okay, because he's really just an innocent. He attempts to join the group, only to be bullied by the lead douchebag, Bumper (Adam DeVine). Seriously, that's his name - Bumper.

Moving on, despite the new fad of films that showcase Ellen Page-type characters as female leads (i.e. likeable, no-nonsense, strong women), Beca sells out (as seen in the trailer), and decides to join the quirky Bellas after Chloe accosts her in the shower when she hears Beca's singing voice. But Beca sings along with the music she creates, so it is assumed that this can be enough to justify the oddity of her willingness to submit to a concept that she declined merely hours ago.

The Bellas recruit the quirkiest auditioners (""Glee"", anyone?), the most notable being Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). Wilson earned the target spot in Entertainment Weekly's ""Bulls-Eye"" column last week, and it is easy to see why, as she is the Gimli of the group (i.e. chubby comic relief). She consistently pokes fun at her own weight before the ""twig"" girls can do it first, and despite being given a solo at one point, she does not have the vocals necessary to impress. Beca is obviously the She's All That type of girl who possesses all the talent and charm that we would all be privy to if she would just remove her nonexistent glasses and let her hair down, as Jesse is quick to point out. Thank you, Mr. Exposition.

Arguably, the most enjoyable vocals in the group next to Beca is Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean), although they barely give her any lines and reduce her to yet another boring stereotype cliche. Of course she's the lesbian - she's the one with the crazy hair who wears flannel shirts. Yawn. Hana Mae Lee is snicker-worthy as Lilly, the token Asian of the group who speaks so quietly that you have to strain to hear her, although all she spews is Ralph Wiggum-type nonsense anyway.

This is one of those films that shows you all of its best moments in the trailer, such as the ""Riff-Off"" in which both the Bellas and the Treblemakers meet in what appears to be a drained pool in a Jets/Sharks attempt to out-sing each other. For what purpose? It is never made clear, but it seems that the ""Riff-Off"" will determine who will win the competition. Not only is this completely inaccurate, but wouldn't you just watch each other's performances at previous competitions? It makes no sense, but it is fun, especially when Beca jumps in with her rendition of Blackstreet's ""No Diggity"".

There is a moment in the film when Jesse is explaining to Beca, who is bored by all movies, that she needs to watch more of them because the endings are the best part, especially when they're unpredictable. This scene masquerades as a relieving foreshadowing, promising that this film will have the surprising and unpredictable ending that Jesse longs for in the films that he wants to someday score. The ending to Pitch Perfect is decent enough, but it certainly won't stick with you long after the film ends. It is not the Rudy of musical comedies.

Banks and John Michael Higgins have cameos in the film a l&agrave; Jason Bateman and Gary Coleman's scenes in Dodgeball. They are announcers for these competitions, and they get ridiculously glam for the occasions, despite no one ever seeing them way up there in their booth. They say silly things that are meant to incite laughter but that are unfunny and insulting, like how women can't win a competition in much the same way that they shouldn't be doctors.

In an attempt to explain that Aubrey is resistent to change, the script calls for The Bellas to perform the same tired version of ""I Saw the Sign"" multiple times until the audience in the film, along with the audience in the theater, falls asleep. These scenes could have actually been funny, if done right. The Bellas could have performed songs that no one had ever heard of, or that haven't been popular since the sixties or seventies. Hearing the same jaded '90s song over and over again felt like each audience member was Alex in A Clockwork Orange, forced to stare at the screen in agony to the point of retching. Speaking of retching...nah, that's a gross surprise you can find out on your own.

Despite the moments of silliness in this film, though, the ending was enjoyable and will give you the warm and fuzzies. Despite being lauded as a ""musical"", this film does not require great acoustics or a theater viewing to get the necessary experience. This film can definitely be passed off as a rental if you'd rather save your cash. It was surprising to see Banks' name attached to a film of lackluster quality, and sad for Kendrick, who is usually equally enjoyable. Pitch Perfect wasn't horrible, but it you shouldn't hate yourself if you decide to skip it.",1349654400,3,7401,4.720588235294118
5192246,5,B008YV11JQ,"First, I do not like Glee, but I LOVE this movie. However, I have taken two friends on two different occasions to see it that like Glee and they LOVED it too. I have seen it 3 times in one week! This movie is for you if you liked the humor in Ted, Hangover or Bridesmaids. Or, if you like sexy chics (Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp) or sexy dudes (Skylar Astin). Or perhaps you just appreciate good voices making music and/or re-mixed music. Oh, and if you haven't had a crush in a while ladies...you're going to after watching this movie. ;-)",1349568000,,540,4.303921568627451

5192249,4,B008YV11JQ,"""Pitch Perfect"" (2012 release; 112 min.) brings the story of college-level competitive acapella singing, and what a fun romp this turns out to be! We follow Becca (played by Anna Kendrick) as a freshman at Barden, a fictitional college in/near Atlanta, and she feels like a fish out of water, wanting to produce music, but eventually charmed into joining the Bellas, an all-girls acapella group. Their big rival is an all-boys acapella group, the Treble Makers, who last year won it all. We get to know the girls in the group, and they are quite the characters!

There is no point in telling you how it all turns out, as it is quite predicatble, but I never lost interest as the movie unfolded. Several comments: this is the first time that Anna Kendrick fronts a movie (I saw her recently in ""End of Watch"" and of course she had a memorable breakout supporting role in ""Up In the Air"" a few years ago), and she delivers. But to be honest, the true scene-stealer is Reben Wilson as ""Fat Amy"", whom we also saw in a supporting role in ""Bridesmaids"" last year, and she is just a hoot. Who said you needed to be a 'classic' good-looking girl to be a great actress?

Then there is the music, which obviously plays a huge role in the movie. I was enthralled by some of the performances, such as the very clever ""Since U Been Gone"" montage of the auditions of the Bellas in the beginning of the movie, and later again when there is an informal 'sing-off' between the acapella teams, eventually seguing into a thrilling performance of ""No Diggity"" by the Bellas. The movie is a delightful fun from start to finish. I saw this movie when it opened in limited release this past weekend, and it will open wide this coming weekend. You can just see why this movie is going to do very, very well, as it has all of the elements to break big: great performances, clever story-telling, and just fun to watch. MILES away from your summer Hollywood  fare of explosions and super-heroes, yet this movie resonates just as well, if not more.",1349222400,,2021,4.516393442622951
5192250,4,B008YV11JQ,"A young girl, Becca(Anna Kendrick) arrives at her new college. She meets mean girls, sweet girls, and weird girls. They all have one thing in common, singing together. They fight to climb to the golden ladder of success in a cutthroat world. A world in which there's a combination of being cool, and insanity. The music is Good, Acting Performance Excellent, and there are moments of laugh-out-loud fun. Rated PG13, not for very young children.

What was amazing about the movie is that there is truly something for literally everyone. While it's not a movie for young children, I would guess everyone over the age of 13 will love this movie!! For the women there's an understated love story going on and for the men, there's very attractive women  and some seriously good humor... and it is funny throughout, it was engaging throughout and the music was amazing. The sound track alone will be worth your time and money when it comes out. I'll definitely be in line to purchase both the Blu-ray of this movie as well as the soundtrack.

I've never written a movie review before but I was so impressed and so moved by this movie... I think you will be too.",1348185600,2,834,4.374193548387097

There are some funny moments, like a singing contest against the male college a cappella group.  Kind of like a Glee continuance with the smash-ups.  Also Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) has a classic little one liner: ""I'm gonna finish you like a cheesecake!!"" After a rival a cappella team throws a burrito at her head.",1510531200,,535,4.782608695652174

5192451,5,B008YV11JQ,"I truly didn't know what to expect when my daughter asked me to purchase this movie. It is hilarious! The music is fabulous and the acapella singing will blow you away! Very talented cast!

For the most part a tween / teen can easily watch without much parental conversation. But there is one scene where two of the ladies are in the shower and you soon learn that a boyfriend is in the shower with one of the ladies. My tween daughter eyes popped out of their head. Movie pause time. The Lollipop song had some sexual innuendos too. So if you are a parent not ready to discuss the birds and the bees this is a movie I would hold off having your tween / young teen kids watch. If you are comfortable and open with your child, this movie will make the whole family laughing!

Highly recommend!",1494633600,,792,4.308724832214765

was terrible. The music was not good and the jokes were not funny.  Hard to understand how the the first Pitch Perfect was so
good and how they went so wrong with number 2. It puts me in mind of the Rodney Dangerfield line in Back to School:""In life look
out for number one and don't step in number two.""  Apply to Pitch Perfect: Enjoy the first one and if you dare to watch
the second one, you'll be scrapping it off your shoe when the credits roll.",1477353600,,582,4.2727272727272725

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

5193115,5,B008YV11JQ,"A Pitch about Pitch Perfect:
A college set comedy about an all female a cappella group and the outsider Beca (Anna Kendrick) who shakes it up, Pitch Perfect revolves around the lowest imaginable stakes, and especially in the opening scenes plays way too closely to the expected beats Kendrick's character Beca at one point actually says out loud, ""I don't want to be in college! I want to move to LA and become a DJ!""

 But once Pitch Perfect gets going, there's absolutely no slowing it down, with Kay Cannon's script slinging one zinger after another, and the young cast of up and comers biting into the film's bitchiness and flashes of heart with such aplomb they should all become stars immediately. Like Mean Girls and Clueless before it, Pitch Perfect takes what ought to be a story with limited appeal and makes it so hilarious you can't deny it. I practically wore out my hand writing down all the great lines, from great put downs like Rebel Wilsons Fat Amy referring to her teammates as ""twiggy bitches"" to giddy nonsense like ""My dad always says if you're not here to win, get the hell out of Kuwait.""

  Kendrick sheds her perky go-getter reputation from Up in the Air, one of her previous films, to play Beca, a city girl who wears a lot of eyeliner and giant DJ headphones, and who would rather create mashups on her laptop and work at the radio station than actually participate in college. But an ultimatum from her dad and some pushy enthusiasm from her friend Chloe (Brittany Snow) leads her to join the Bellas, the prissy all girl a cappella group that bit the dust at nationals the year before thanks to some uncharacteristic nerves from Aubrey (Anna Camp), who rules the group with a clenched smile and an iron fist. The Bellas are having a rebuilding year, and after auditions a terrific montage of people singing Kelly Clarkson's ""Since U Been Gone they're left with a motley crew that includes Beca, Fat Amy and a handful of other girls who don't quite live up to Aubrey's glossy sorority girl expectations.

 There's plenty of inter group conflict to tackle, but Beca is also dealing with pressure from her dad, and most of all a flirtation with Jesse (Skylar Astin), a cutie from the rival all boy a cappella group, led by the douchey Bumper (Adam DeVine, who is essentially Jack Black reincarnated). Everything comes to a head several times at a series of a cappella competitions, where Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins provide Best In Show-style commentary that threatens to steal the movie right out from under the kids.

  The movie has many labored musical numbers, featuring actors with real singing chops and inventive riffs on many, many familiar pop hits. The ""Since U Been Gone"" audition is the first jolt of unsure thought about the movie, but then comes the improv sing-off in an empty pool featuring ""Let's Talk About Sex"" and ""No Diggity,"" and the grand finale features a series of mash-ups so fun and surprising I won't spoil them. Even with its sharp irony, Pitch Perfect takes the musical numbers pretty seriously, and the emotions that slip in through the jokes may force you to acknowledge you're more invested in the story than you might want to admit.

 I recommend this movie to people who enjoy musicals, if you don't then stay clear from this movie. I give this an 9/10. Whenever I watch this movie with someone I have to tell them to shut up and sing along. Now I am not saying that in a mean way I just want then to enjoy the very up beat musical. Overall I would watch this movie again and again. Now go turn your device off and watch this movie, if your into musicals.",1456272000,,3630,4.610852713178295

Oh, it's definitely campy!

Becca is a spirited college freshman attending Barton University. Her father, a professor at the University, wants her to pursue her academics, but what she really wants is to be a DJ. Her heart isn't in her studies, and she's at odds with her father and the forced education. He pushes her to become more involved, and isn't happy when she takes a job working for the school's radio station.

When this isn't enough to satisfy her father, and the school's all-woman a capella group approaches her to invite her to join, she auditions and joins the team. Unaccustomed to social relationships with other girls, Becca struggles with the leader of the group while navigating the muddy waters of forbidden romance.

The movie is funny and it's fun, and the music that the a cappella groups produce is outstanding. If you enjoy adult humor, you'll love the banter from the announcers.

This is the movie that proved that Anna Kendrick was so much more than Twilight.

I loved just about everything about this movie and can make no complaints. I'm a fan of listening to the music because the actors are incredibly talented.",1453248000,4,1352,4.731914893617021

Although the plot line was predictable like every other movie out there nowadays , it was good for a few laughs. I enjoyed it, as well as my buddies.

This is absolutely the BEST feel good, no feel GREAT movie I have seen in years. After initially watching it, I immediately watched it again. It is well written and I say this with a bias, because I grew up singing in an a capella group.
I had no idea Anna Kendrick could sing, her voice is elegant and powerful. Rebel Wilson as ""Fat Amy"" steals the scenes she is in, and I had no idea she could sing either. I was pleasantly surprised as I watched this movie. I have downloaded it into my cell phone now so when I wanna feel good I just begin watching it. I cannot wait for the second movie to be released!

My biggest complaint is that this movie can't decide what it wants to be.  Is it a coming of age story? Is it a gross out comedy? Is it a competition movie?  Is it a romantic comedy?  I'm all for genre benders but the switches in tone, and style are so jarring that it seems like someone else has the remote and keeps changing the channel.  And so much is made out of the fact that they can compete despite not having any bass voices and they win (in part) because one of the girls has an injury that causes her voice to go down to the bass register.

5193959,3,B008YV11JQ,"Whether you like the film itself or not, you will admit there is one good thing in Pitch Perfect: acapella performances. Well, it may not be as good as you expected, but still it is fine. Dont expect more than that, and perhaps you will enjoy the musical comedy, despite the predictable story and stereotyped characters.

Anna Kendrick is Beca Mitchell, a freshman, who is recruited into an all-female acapella group the Barden Bellas. Skylar Astin is Jesse Swanson, a nice and outgoing guy who joins another group Treblemakers. Part of the film is about their romantic relationship, and two stars did a decent job.

But the films storyline is weak. Beca says she really wants to be a DJ, which is not very convincing. Beca is rebellious enough to disobey the groups leader on stage, but will not quit the group, or the college for that matter. Why should we follow this impossible and almost non-existent story, especially when she is often an unlikable person?

The reason is, of course, the films musical set-pieces, and they are decent. The rest of the film is just another formulaic Hollywood-made college comedy.",1437091200,,1118,4.842931937172775

5194057,5,B008YV11JQ,"I'm a 30-something man who's into football and tools and gadgets.  After my wife patiently let me decide the last few movies (they all had things exploding), I decided we'd settle down for a comedy/chick-flick.  I had no idea how much I would enjoy this movie.
For the record, I'm not into this new generation of entertainment.  I've never watched Glee, or any of those singing competition reality shows.  My idea of quality entertainment is binge-watching Breaking Bad.  I didn't know who Skylar Astin is and couldn't care less.  But I was raised with a heavy Bollywood influence, so I'm used to suspending disbelief when it comes to corny rom-com plots and just going with it.  I can appreciate a good tug at the heart-strings, but only if its accompanied with smart, witty, raunchy humor.
This movie has an excellent mix of humor, young people puppy love (why was college not like this for me??), and music.  The accapella angle made it interesting and unique, and the finale is even more musically interesting.  And I think it's pretty neat how the actors/actresses actually sang the tracks (with professional mixing, of course).  Anna Kendrick is a multi-talented actress who was perfect for her role, but Rebel Wilson is a force and truly truly carries this movie.  We died of laughter at her lines.  She's the new Meg McCarthy, except she's got an awesome accent and brilliant deadpan delivery.
So tough (and not-so-tough) guys, give this one a shot with your partners/spouses.  At the very least you'll get some brownie points, and you might even enjoy yourself.  Heck, the Green Bay Packers O-line sure did and landed themselves a movie spot because of it.",1436140800,,1665,4.858156028368795

Not just a chick flick, this has serious legs as a comedy.

It's mean girls, meets glee, meets bridesmaids and all blended together into a great film that leaves you wanting to belt out some tunes. Soundtrack rocks!",1435968000,,538,4.546391752577319

In fact, I had no intention to watch it, until a friend loaned me the DVD and encouraged me to give it a chance.  Although the story and acting is a bit cheesy at times, I found the movie to be funny (my favorite character was Lilly), entertaining and with some good music and singing.  To my surprise, I liked it, even though this is not within my norm of movie watching.

The good news is that you have nothing to fear, because Jason Moore's picture is a total blast. The only places where Pitch Perfect really stutters, are when Kay Cannon's screenplay tries to focus on non-vocal aspects of the story. Not only do these scenes disrupt the film's flow, but they feel superfluous, adding unnecessary running time to what could be a much tighter movie. These plot issues feel like relatively minor flubs in the overall performance though, since the rest of the picture is such a damn good time.",1435881600,,690,4.956896551724138

5194155,3,B008YV11JQ,"Somehow, I missed what Pitch Perfect was even about until a friend learned I loved a Capella music and told me about it.  Ever since then, its been on my to be watched list, which means I had to set my DVR when I saw it on TV.  I think I paid about the right price.  It grew on me, but it wasn't as great as I had hoped.

Beca (Anna Kendrick) is a freshman at Barden University, but against her will.  She wants to go to LA to start a career in music, but her father is insisting she have at least one year in school first.  And she has to join some kind of group or club and attempt to make friends.

That choice is helped along when she is overheard singing in the shower and is asked to join the Bellas, the schools all-women a Capella group.  Last year, they made it to the national finals, something womens groups have a hard time doing.  They are hoping to actually win this year, which means beating the all-male group at Barden, the Treblemakers.  However, Beca is quickly clashing with the Bellass leader, Aubrey (Anna Camp) over just about everything.  Will it work out?  Can the Bellas rise above the past and win?

The plot is perfectly fine.  Its a fairly predictable story, but that never bothers me as long as Im having fun along the way.  And I did have some fun  once things settle down in the second half.

I actually had several issues with the film.  The first?  Projectile vomiting.  Twice.  Enough said there, right?  Moving on, the characters are just plain weird.  I don't know that there was a normal one in the bunch.  Now, I don't mind oddball characters as a rule, but this movie seemed to be almost mocking them, especially in the beginning.  Considering I hate what I have termed awkward humor, situations where we are supposed to laugh at someone making a fool of themselves, I really had a problem with that in the beginning.  I realized as I was watching the film that this is part of my problem with Rebel Wilson, who appears here as Fat Amy, another of the new Bellas.  We are supposed to laugh at her being stupid, and I just don't find it amusing.

However, as the film went on, all that began to change.  Some of the characters showed some depth.  They all stopped being completely clueless idiots.  And as they became friends, I got behind the movie and started rooting for them to get the well-deserved happy ending.  Well, most of them.  There were still a couple of jerks in the cast, but we weren't supposed to warm up to them.

One thing that never changed for me was my opinion of the commentators.  Played by Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, they provided some color commentary for the viewers at home (I guess the contests were televised?  I never got that).  However, these comments were filled with pointless sexual innuendo and sexism.  They added nothing to the film and actually took away from my enjoyment.

However, I did enjoy the music.  Wow was it fabulous.  Im seriously thinking about getting the sound track.  Any time the groups are singing, and there is plenty of singing, the movie is wonderful.

And the acting is great as well.  Everyone brought their characters to life perfectly.  Yes, as much as I don't like the characters she plays, Rebel Wilson did a good job with Fat Amy.  I also really enjoy Skylar Astin as Becas potential love interest Jesse.

So Im left feeling ambivalent about the film.  Pitch Perfect definitely had some moments I enjoyed, but there was also plenty that made me cringe along the way.  Even though I loved the music, I probably won't rush out to watch it again.",1435104000,,3566,4.445820433436532

5194185,3,B008YV11JQ,Good singing. Silly and predictable plot. But harmless and somewhat enjoyable. Prob appeals to younger adults. Saw it to prep for pitch perfect 2 which looks good in ads.,1434585600,,170,4.896551724137931
5194186,2,B008YV11JQ,"So, as a >movie<, this product sucks. The acting is tuh-rrible and the plot is downright dopey. The lesser characters are actually quite good. Rebel Wilson is fan-diddly-tastic and hell-arious. Love her to pieces and the other minor characters are great too. But geez the movie is mostly so gawd-awful it's painful to sit through.

Now the singing and the routines - those are terrific. Save yourself the time of watching this paper thin dopey plot and just fast forward to the sing-offs and the competitions.",1434585600,,509,4.9186046511627906

5194311,5,B008YV11JQ,"Fun movie, very entertaining and amusing.

I saw someone felt my review was not helpful. Anna Kendrick plays a young woman entering college her freshman year; she is heavily interested in becoming a DJ and a music producer. After her father encourages her to get involved in some school activities, she ends up joining an acapella music group. Hilarity ensues and romance blossoms between her and a gentlemen in a male acapella group.",1433894400,,434,4.945205479452055
5194312,4,B008YV11JQ,"Love a musical where about every singing performance is one worth hearing.  Pleasantly surprised by the tonality and range of the leads, performance of a capella singing no easy thing.  Liked the banter between contesting teams, and yet the support that shared when time to be shared.  Wilson a delightful standout, Snow a surprising voice not seen elsewhere, and Hello, Anna Kendrick!",1433894400,,385,5.17741935483871

5194323,5,B008YV11JQ,"I am a 12 year old girl from Kentucky. I love this movie because it is very funny. This is a comedy movie there is very little curse words in this movie. The violence is like comedic. The main characters name is Beca. The movies theme is a completion. The cinematography was really good in the movie, like the sound effects, the sound effects they would use for the sounds they make with their mouths. Adults and young teenagers would like to see this movie, but this movie is not really for kids, it is really for ages 13 and up. Both males and females would like this movie. This movie is about groups of people who make sounds of interments with their mouths. This movie is really cool because they make really cool sounds with their mouths and it sounds like the real sounds of the interments. Its really interesting. There are two movies. There is pitch perfect and pitch perfect 2, but both movies are really good ages under 13 without permission should not watch this movie. This movie has some curse words. Pitch perfect 2 just came out May 15. I love both movies they are really good, you would like this movie if you are into comedy. I rate this movie 5/5 stars. I would recommend this movie to ages 13 and up both boys and girls would like this movie. It is really good. If your not into comedy you would not like this movie. I was aloud to watch the movie because I got permission my mo watched it with me so just in case and my sister watched it to, she is 15 so my mom said as long as I have super vision I could watch it.",1433808000,,1536,4.2101694915254235

5194327,5,B008YV11JQ,"I am a big fan of this subject, having participated in a cappella groups and performances most of my life since my early teens (now I am 59 and finally have retired my fading vocal instrument).  I am certainly a biased viewer given my fondness for the genre.  That said, I purchased this as a digital download after multiple viewings of the film via rental and pay-TV presentations. I found repeat viewings remain enjoyable, largely for the musical presentations but also the character focus of the story. Though predictably exaggerated to hyperbolic stereotypical excess, most were tolerably positive and enjoyable, if somewhat unrealistic. It is a Hollywood version of reality, after all.  But the singing is stellar, the arrangements often inspired and these are the 'special effects' I love the most in movies. I find myself replaying the music in my head long afterward, always a sign to me of a positive film-going experience. Highly recommended, except to those with the crippling inability to comprehend and enjoy vocal harmonies; I pity those persons, they do exist.",1433721600,,1075,5.096590909090909

Wow-- so boring and predictable.. and so well behaved. Hey I was no tea totaler in school but come on--- if this is the way kids act in college (other than the singing- again- it was truly enjoyable and engaging to see... I wish all schools could produce talent and passion this terrific!) then we are doomed lol!,1433721600,,470,4.292134831460674

5194336,4,B008YV11JQ,"The movie was fun loving and enjoyable, the singing was amazing and clearly the best part of the movie. I enjoyed when the girls were individually revealed as their true selves and not the losers they first appear to be. But that adds a bit of unreality to the end of the movie when the magically are able to harmonize together at a moments notice and then without any apparent work or strategy they bust out with a winning performance that I believe only one girl has the ability to do and pull off but somehow magically all the other girls are able to do it too. Which is why I give the movie a rating of 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise I'd give the movie a 5 star rating. I guess there just wasn't time in the movie to show how the girls pull it together at the end to make that winning magic happen. But the ending makes the movie worth seeing. I love all the individual talent that is displayed, it makes the movie enjoyable throughout the whole time. And I believe everyone, winners and non-winners alike walk away with a feel good vibe. There is also some comedy to the movie which adds a nice twist at moments where its needed and is perfectly timed. You may feel bad for the fat girl at first but theres a surprise in the movie that makes you feel really happy for her and you laugh cause none of the other girls know about it and so its just the perfect surprising twist and you stop feeling sorry for the fat girl, you start to envy her. lol. Theres lots of surprises in the losers group of performers come the finale'. So watch the movie and enjoy and look forward to the end, which I played over and over.",1433721600,,1618,4.205787781350482

5194647,5,B008YV11JQ,"I really did not know what to think about Pitch Perfect when it was first released. At the time, I just could not bring myself to watch it. I honestly expected to dislike this movie, but my review of Pitch Perfect will detail why I enjoy this movie.

After settling in to her new dorm room at Barden University, Beca ventures around her campus and soon comes across two girls Aubrey and Chloe who are recruiting for their A capella group. As it turns out, Beca has a lovely voice; and despites Aubrey's initial disapproval, they allow Beca into the Barden Bellas and so begins Pitch Perfect.

Anna Kendrick shines as Beca in Pitch Perfect. Beca has an amazing vocal range, but she is also this sort of reserved person with an interest as a DJ. Brittany Snow stars as Chloe alongside Anna Camp who plays the little TOO overzealous leader of the Bellas, Aubrey respectively. Rebel Wilson is absolutely hilarious in her turn as Fat Amy, While Skylar Astin portrays Jesse and does a good job.

Musical numbers are present, but Pitch Perfect benefits from having both a cohesive plot and likable characters. I like how the movie balances humor and still keeps in tune with what it is trying to achieve. I will say that once the 3rd act starts, you can kind of tell what will happen, but even still, Pitch Perfect is a fun film due to the acting, the music, and the story. I will be seeing the already released sequel so expect a review soon. And to close, Pitch Perfect is

A Very Good Experience

I am an Adam Devine fan, so I enjoyed seeing him as an unexpected treat.  The humor is pretty juvenile, the joke about a body part that resembles bologna is typical.  The idea that there is more than one A Capella group from the SAME school at the SAME regional competition is not realistic, but realism is not why you would watch such a movie.  One reviewer pointed out that it does stereotype Asians unfairly as cliqued out snobs, so don't watch it for political correctness.  Although there is no nudity, I think it is a bit racy for anyone under the age of 12.",1432857600,,668,4.434426229508197

5194674,2,B008YV11JQ,"Distinguishing the good from the bad in this film has never been easier.  The Good is the singing, music, and performance.  The bad is pretty much everything else.

Have you ever ""Bring it on?""  Or ""Drumline""?  Or ""You got Served""?  Or basically any other movie about organized competition?  Then you've seen this.  It's just an endless list of competition film cliches:  The main character who is reluctantly convinced to join a team in competitions they were never interested in at the start of the movie.  A friend or love interest on a rival team.  A team that makes a horrible mistake at the start of the movie, and spends the rest of the film seeking redemption  A leader who is a total control freak.  Constant battles between the leader's old school style and the team members who want to try new and hip things.  The main character's conflict with a parent.  A big blunder that causes the main character to leave the team and start on an inevitable path to rejoining through atonement.  It just goes on and on.

Not only that, but many the cliche issues are laughably contrived, or just flat out make no sense.  Most notable is the conflict between the main character (Becca) and her father, whose only flaw is that he happens to be divorced (We get no evidence that the divorce was his fault or that it was due to a severe flaw or mistake on his part).  It simply shouldn't exist.  Becca's father seems like a completely loving and supportive family man, yet the film still tries desperate to create some type of adversarial situation between them.  The absolute worst thing he does is insist the Becca finishes college (which he is paying for) before moving to LA (at his expense) to chase her dreams.  Oh horror of horrors!  How dare he insist the she get a college education on his dime before chasing pipe dreams in LA on his dime?  Seriously, we should all be so lucky to have such wonderful parents if that's the worst thing they are guilty of.

The characters are every bit as contrived and cliched as the plot.  We have the fat girl who is distinguished by being fat.  The overbearing power-mad leader who is distinguished by being power-mad and overbearing.  The quirky asian girl who is distinguished by being asian and quirky.  Seriously, this is the most one-dimentional cast I can recall seeing in years

And this is really a shame, since the core of the film, the singing and performances, are actually quite good.  That was pretty much the only thing that made this film watchable, and the final performance is flat out amazing.  That partially made up for how terrible everything else was, but simply could not save the film on its own.

Overall, I just cannot believe all the praise this film gets.  This has got to be the most overrated movie of the decade.  There is just nothing that makes this film exceptional.  It's simply bland heavily contrived competition movie that just happens to be about a type of competition that hasn't been covered yet.",1432857600,2,2979,4.62906309751434

5194737,3,B008YV11JQ,I was torn between 3 stars and 4 stars. Definitely not a 5 star movie (of course most movies aren't). The heavy-set Caucasian actress was the funniest part of the whole movie. I wouldn't recommend buying the dvd but I would recommend watching the movie at least once in your lifetime.,1432771200,,284,4.588235294117647

The comedy is excellent and modern, meaning actually funny, not just cheap laughs and mean jokes. Saving fourth star for Oscar shoe-ins but this could compete for best comedy.

Then, several months later, I came across it on HBO, and thought - what the heck. Now, I am truly sorry I didn't see it in theatres, and I will be lined up to see the sequel when it comes out next week.

Pitch Perfect is a perfect ensemble movie. Every character fits the actor, and you actually feel you know them by the end of the movie. The main cast is wonderful, but Elizabeth Banks's role as a commentator is possibly the underrated highlight of the film. All of the mash up songs are catchy, great, and will stick with you. I honestly prefer the audition song version of Kelly Clarkson's ""Since You Been Gone"" to the actual version, as it exemplifies some excellent a capella work.
This is a movie you can watch over and over, and be perfectly happy.",1431043200,,854,4.2392638036809815
5195234,4,B008YV11JQ,"Whats it about?

Beca (Anna Kendrick) isn't the sociable type but somehow gets cajoled into joining a social activity group called the Bellas. They sing songs without any instruments at all. Its all from our mouths (insert appropriate blonde giggle here). But the Bellas are going to have to switch up their tired repertoire if they want a shot at beating their rivals, the Treblemakers, at nationals.

What did I think?

This film is what you would get if you sucked Glee dry of all its sugary, saccharine nonsense and injected it full of sassy, smart dialogue and a twisted sense of humor. Rebel Wilson steals the show as Fat Amy and had people in my audience applauding nearly every time she was on screen. There are moments where Pitch Perfect verges on taking itself too seriously, but they are few and this flick has attitude.",1431043200,,832,4.684931506849315

5195508,5,B008YV11JQ,So I am sitting here watching this movie and I can say that it is very good. I mean I love the story behind it and the music in it is very good. I have downloaded some of the songs and also have favorited them on other sites. But I think it is a cute movie that teens would like only because some things in it could relate to them. But have you had the chance to experience this movie. There are also many parts in which a character named Fat Amy is truly funny. I love this actress and I know that she only came on the scene in the last couple years. She is truly is a talented actress and I know that there will be many more good things from her. I think that in my opinion she is what gave the comedy to the movie without it I think that it wouldnt have been as good.,1428278400,,770,3.81875

The movie demonstrated how much talent is really out there.  Its an uplifting movie with a good ""growing up theme.""  This is a more than entertaining film. Yes, the film is tailored to the youth but it appeals to individuals of all ages and gives a very favorable view to the acapella form of music.",1428192000,,439,4.45

5195535,2,B008YV11JQ,A mindless romp highlighting acapella choirs and faux competition.  I am NOT a fan of gross so several scenes lowered what would have been a 3 stars review.

5195540,5,B008YV11JQ,"Beca,Anna Kendrick, is our protagonist, who is starting college but, she is unhappy about it. She wants to really move to LA and become a DJ, but her dad, a college professor, says she has to join a school club for the year. If she does, her dad will help her move to LA. Beca finds an a capella group called the Barden Bellas, whose leader, Aubrey, Anna Camp, is very controlling and makes everyone do the same routine over and over again, with old songs. After losing a competition Beca gets into a big blowout with the group and quits, thinking that it is the best decision.
While the movie may be funny, I think that the director tried to bring out the theme of you don't know what the person next you has been through. For example, when Becas dad and mom got divorced, Beca just blocked out everyone, even when her dad tried so hard to make things right between them. Another example is when Becas dad and her are talking, after the big blowout, and Beca realizes that she blocks out anyone who tries to help her.
Overall I think Pitch Perfect is an excellent movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is mature and honestly just needs a good laugh. It is rated pg-13 because of language and some content. Pitch Perfect is honestly one of the best movies I have seen and I am very excited for the second one to come out in May.",1427932800,,1340,4.300395256916996

5195600,5,B008YV11JQ,"First off - I hate musicals.  HATE them.  This, IMO, is absolutely not a musical.  Well, maybe it is, but it's the first one that I've ever seen where the music didn't suck.  :)

There are so many positive reviews for this, and I'll just chime in one more because I think the movie deserves it.  I think it's hilarious with great characters and character interaction.  The music is also very good.  Granted, a lot of the songs in the competition scenes don't sound a cappella to me because of the heavy bass beats, but I'm okay with that.

You can check out the preview and (if it's still there) the entire soundtrack on YouTube.  I think that the video clips currently here on Amazon don't come close to conveying how funny this movie is at times.

The blu-ray drops down around $10 from time to time, and I think it's totally worth that.  I put off buying it when it was up around $20, but I snagged it over the holidays for about $10.  Great audio and video quality, and a great movie.  Highly recommended.",1427500800,,1009,4.354838709677419

5195701,3,B008YV11JQ,"Interesting story about the need to belong, to contribute, to compete, to change.  Also about leadership, and how it works and doesn't.  Subtly woven into the story is the main character, music, and our human need to make it beautiful with our voices and our skill.  Directed at a teenage crowd with a somewhat predictable story, but with valuable lessons.  As a grownup, I prefer views of more complex values and dilemmas.  Pitch Perfect was fun to share with my teenage granddaughter and her mom who both loved it.",1426550400,,516,4.752808988764045

5195727,4,B008YV11JQ,"This was a fun, fun movie, anchored by terrific a capella performances, and arrangements. Some very good performances here, particularly those of Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Skylar Astin and Brittany Snow.  The rest of the cast is mostly enjoyable, but the roles were very limited to ""types"" with minimal character development.
It's really a 3-1/2 Star Movie -- 5 for the musical performances and 2 for story and character development.  Some of the downsides:
1.  Other than Anna Kendrick, the rest of the cast play two-dimensional characters.  Most of the characters are white, and what little ethnic diversity exists, confines itself to cliches or has no color to it (pun intended).
2.  The father-daughter relationship is hackneyed, a throwback to old TV sitcoms.
3.  The progression from area to national competition was lame and lacked any believable increasing levels of competition.  I would never have voted for the ""hero"" group to move into the finals.  They were just not that good.  Even the device that got them into the finals was silly -- were there no groups any better than our heroes in the entire region?

Watch it for the music and some of the competition performances.  If you don't expect much of a film experience, and you won't be disappointed",1426032000,2,1267,4.957345971563981

So for the first time ever, I was disappointed when my dentist finished my filling, because the movie wasn't over yet. I sent home and checked Netflix, on demand, hulu, and prime instant video, without success.. I would have to pay to watch the end of this movie. So Amazon got a few more dollars from me for the convenience of instant streaming on my smart tv. But it was with it. A little cheesy and somewhat predictable, but fun and a good laugh.

My husband and I watched this movie and we were laughing hysterically the whole time. It's a great film. It's entertaining and I personally love Anna Kendrick as an actress.

5195853,3,B008YV11JQ,"Went into this without watching trailers or knowing anything about it; other than what acopella is...I have an aunt that sang with the Sweet Adelines for decades. It is ok, it plays out a lot of tropes and rides on (typically funny) sterotypes. It somehow misses the mark. I didn't feel attached to the group enough to root for them. The love interest was forced, rushed and underdeveloped.

They worked a ton of pop songs from the last 30 years into this, but being in my mid 30's and recognizing so many of them, makes me wonder if this was a period flic from my tween years. I mean, do college students even listen to ""vintage"" stuff like that now?? Some of the skits were cleverly executed and fun to watch.

HUGE TURN-OFF..... Gratuitous VOMIT scenes...didn't fit. Not funny. I'm not even a sypathy puker...

If you're feeling like my review is a bit spastic, well, that's how I felt about this movie.

'Mean Girls' meets 'Glee' meets every college trope movie ever made.",1424563200,,976,4.591954022988506

Really a very fun and surprisingly funny story with some memorable characters. Overall it was a delight - the only thing that holds me back from four stars is that it maybe had one too many songs (I found it a bit repetitive, but your expectations may vary for a borderline musical) and there were some forgivable but undeniable plot holes that could have been handled better. Still, a great movie.",1424390400,,511,4.389473684210526

5195983,3,B008YV11JQ,"With all the rave reviews, I was disappointed this wasn't funnier. Don't get me wrong--Pitch Perfect is cute and fun, but not as hilarious as the hype led me to hope. Rebel Wilson is laugh-out-loud funny, but the rest of the cast isn't, except maybe Hana Mae Lee, playing a shy girl who says outrageous things so quietly you can barely hear her. The plot isn't terrible original; the movie draws it's energy from great covers. I enjoyed Pitch Perfect, but I was disturbed by some of its stereotypes (the unfriendly Dragon Lady roommate and the predatory lesbian whose unwanted advances cause a teammate to blow a rape whistle). Why isn't a supposedly female-empowering, feel-good comedy more aware of the subtle messages it's sending its impressionable teen audience?",1422576000,,767,5.0

Still, it is a silly, self-aware comedy with relatively likeable characters and a fantastic selection of 90s pop to help round things out.  Honestly, if it weren't for the songs it would have only earned 2 stars from me, but who doesn't love some Ace of Base and Blackstreet?",1420156800,,419,4.402597402597403

A perfect mixture of crowd pleaser songs and group dancing forced me to fall in love with acapella, an organization I had no prior knowledge.

5196412,5,B008YV11JQ,"Taking place on the college campus known as Barden University, Pitch Perfect is a movie that appeals to a variety of audiences, but most importantly music fanatics. In the movie, there are two major a cappella groups, Barden Bellas and the Treblemakers, which have been competing against one another for several years. The annual competition means everything to these two groups and it is interesting to see how they make it all come together.  This upbeat, spunky movie illustrates how something small and boring can turn into something big and wonderful. It also demonstrates how something that would be thought to be just a whacky noise can turn into an amazing performance.  Pitch Perfect offers a talented enactment while also allowing the viewers to see several different types of self-expression.
 I believe that every good movie has to have at least a little bit of comedy throughout. Pitch Perfect provides just the right amount of comedy which in turn makes the movie that more entertaining. The well-known actress, Rebel Wilson, plays a huge part in making this movie so comedic. In the movie, when she introduces herself to the Barden Bellas, she refers to herself as Fat Amy because she doesnt want people talking bad about her behind her back and then falls to the ground and acts like a mermaid (Moore, Pitch Perfect). With her British accent and her sarcastic words, Rebel Wilson pulls this movie together making it humorous for all crowds.
 The plot that carries throughout the movie is one that can relate to many things in everyday life. In the beginning, the Barden Bellas are trying to recover from a major loss at their last competition, but they aren't having much luck recruiting girls. In a review, Todd McCarthy states, A too-cool-for-you smarminess sheathes the cutthroat competitiveness at Barden U., where, on club recruiting day, The Bellas, an all-female a cappella group, urgently need new blood to have a chance of beating male rivals The Treblemakers, who prevailed in the national finals the previous spring (McCarthy, Hollywood Reporter). When actress Anna Kendrick joins their group, she brings new ideas and change which leads them to a victory at their competition. This illustrates that even when you think there is no hope, something can come along and turn whatever it may be into something great.
 The actors and actresses are what make the movie come together as a whole and these people play a major role in these films. Pitch Perfect features several well-known actors and actresses including, Rebel Wilson, Anna Kendrick, and Adam DeVine. In a particular evaluation, Olly Richards states, Anna Kendrick, who yet again hits just the right note between pithy and chummy, is splendid as the girl baffled by the weird politics of her new school(Richards, Empire Online). Anna Kendrick comes into the new school year not knowing much of anything or anyone at the campus until she meets the Barden Bellas and decides to join. She then makes new friends throughout her adventure and also finds out who her true friends really are, all while she is trying to make the Barden Bellas win the championship. Bringing in these famous people helps the movie to become even more spectacular and helps it to come together as one piece.
 With all of the smashups, jam sessions in empty pools, and a cappella singing, this movie is by far appealing to all audiences. Pitch Perfect continuously throws curveballs and surprises the audiences just as much as it gives basic expectations, but with all of this, it fits perfectly together. Not only is the movie entertaining, but it illustrates that anyone can be talented, even if you are using your mouth to make cool noises. Pitch Perfect can easily be described as a-ca-awesome.",1414540800,,3756,4.972929936305732

But as their singing and teamwork develops...it is a journey that becomes powerful and, at some point, has you yelling in your seat. A must see. See it with a tween, teen, or 20-something if possible. For once, no vampires, just genuine friendships and talent that emerges from insecurity. Also, you see girls who were destined to fail, instead work, fight with a lot of heart, and succeed. It is so inspiring and worthy! Or, just watch it and enjoy, like I did. A gem I had never heard of. Kind of like these young women. TERRIFIC MOVIE.",1413331200,,643,4.699115044247788

5196513,5,B008YV11JQ,"The movie Pitch Perfect is a wonderful movie appealing to a wide audience. The actors in the film portray their characters very accurately and show their comedic side. This snappy, energetic, and lovable film shows an a cappella group in college fighting for first place at nationals in New York City.

The films main character, Beca played by Anna Kendrick, is a freshman at Barden U., but wants to travel to L.A. to pursue her show business. Her father, who is also a professor at Barden, tells her she must stay at college and join an after school activity. So she gets involved in one of the a cappella group on campus, where she meets another group member Fat Amy played by Rebel Wilson, and the leaders of the group, Chloe and Aubrey, played by Brittany Snow and Anna Camp. Beca plays a big role as the film starts with her coming to school and ends with her love for Jesse, played by Skylar Astin, that makes all the romance lovers in the audience go crazy. The characters are all brilliant but this movie wouldnt be as great if it wasn't for Fat Amy.

The director, Jason Moore, creates this movie with one thing in mind, to keep the audience watching. He, in fact, does a very pleasing job of this. The audience is hooked from the opening lines to the ending credits. The characters are well thought of, the music brings the right amount of spunk, and the romance never fails in the drama department. His creation of Fat Amy was the best by far and doesnt disappoint.

Fat Amy, which she calls herself so twig bitches won't call her that behind her back, has a huge personality. She lightens up the movie with her humor and also shows the reality of her life. During the intense or sometimes sad times, she throws in a witty line that gets the audience laughing. She isn't ashamed of her size and even says that thin people have fat hearts. Fat Amy gives the audience a lesson that anyone is able to do what they want. In the movie, Fat Amy reveals a lot about herself to the group that she normally wouldnt have. She explains how her name is really Fat Patricia and that she is the best singer in Tasmania with teeth. She has many talents including driving busses and many forms of dancing ranging from ballroom to mermaid dancing. Her only weakness would be any form of cardio, which she states many times.

The musical performances are catchy and well done, and the characters are engaging. The music combines oldies and new pop lovers into a whole new crowd with the a cappella lovers. All in all, this is an excellent movie that won't disappoint. The love for Fat Amy only makes the film better, and also creates a whole new meaning behind Pitch Perfect.",1411516800,,2668,4.483539094650205

Kendrick's voice is amazing for someone who was not known for singing in her big movies over the past 5 years.  I see now why she is singing in everything she's in now,  practically.  And these girls are FUNNY.  And raunchy.  Great mix.

Rebel Wilson is priceless.  To learn that she improvised most every joke makes this movie even more spectacular.

The singing in the pool, both times, is REALLY good.  Could watch those scenes like music videos over and over.  The shower scene is priceless.  And the Bellas final performance sends shivers all over, especially at the beginning when the fast tempo music kicks in.",1410825600,,786,4.594202898550725

5196556,4,B008YV11JQ,"Bought this after my kids (12 and 10) had seen it at their aunt/uncle's house and loved it.  It quickly became the go-to movie for them, and they've often been heard humming the music.  Ok, so some of the sexual innuendo (some of it in song) isn't exactly age-appropriate, but then, the original Grease movie had a lot of that when we were kids, so I'm letting that go.  YMMV.  My kids know the Facts of Life and can keep the ages and circumstances of the movie characters separate from their own lives.  Anyway, this movie is a lot of fun overall, with great tunes, some laughs, and a good lesson on not trying to be too controlling, or too prickly.  I could do without the two scenes of projectile vomiting, but that's easily avoided once you know it's coming.  Recommended if you like a capella music, pop tunes, pretty young men and women, and happy endings.",1410307200,3,862,4.452229299363057

5196575,2,B008YV11JQ,"This movie has some very funny moments (Rebel Wilson offers wry hysterics). However, it is filled with predictably stereotypical characters, who offer cardboard cutout versions of themselves with Disney like stoicism. For parents of small children, there are a couple of scenes of implied nudity/sexuality and college drinking (since the main character is a freshman, underage drinking is suggested). For young adults and up...the movie is relatively benign : )",1409788800,2,461,5.6

I could-not for the life of me figure out what the heck she laughed at throughout the movie. By the end, I may have even been in some sort of a transe. Apparently it has comedy in it. We must have been watching something completely different from each other. It isn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but I wish there was a rent option.

It's a cute, happy go lucky type movie with some humor included.  The movie reminded me a lot of Bring It On except instead of cheerleading it's about accapella singing.  I thought the best parts of this movie were the sections that involved singing.  Otherwise, it's a typical boy meets girl, girl hurts guy, girl makes grand gesture to win guy back type movie.

5196698,1,B008YV11JQ,"Painfully bad.  One can't blame the actors, though, since they were given a terrible script and wooden, predictable direction.  Of course this story is formulaic -- but there is no blame in following a formula.  Almost all stories (and songs) are based on a well-known pattern; it's what you do with the formula that counts.  This movie follows a well-trodden path, but instead of coming up with a fresh approach or truly funny bits or sharp dialogue, it simply tries to recreate what has been done better.

I was surprised to learn that Anna Kendrick was the same actress who played Jessica Stanley, a classmate of Bella and Edward's, in all of the ""Twilight"" movies. Anna really shows her acting and singing skills in this film. Boy, can she sing! It's no wonder that ""Pitch Perfect"" was a smash hit, mainly due to Anna Kendrick's performance as Beca Mitchell. I consider her one of my favorite actresses and singers in the entertainment world today. I can't wait for the sequel!

5196729,3,B008YV11JQ,"First off, I'll admit to not being a fan of GLEE and I don't really get the fascination with acappella. It's just singing without instruments, and the most fun I can see people having with it is as a novelty. Still, I decided to check out PITCH PERFECT and see what all the fuss was about. My general impression was that the musical numbers were pretty good across the board, and quite creative. Everything else just kind of drags it down a bit. The basic plot is that an all-girl college acappella group is trying to redeem themselves after an embarrassing loss at the last year's finals. It also served as an opportunity for a diverse group of girls, who normally wouldn't be together, to get to know each other and become friends. The cast isn't really filled with a lot of recognizable faces, but they all give decent performances. Still, the lack of character depth is apparent and none of them really approach anything past caricatures. Everyone has a couple of characteristics or quirks that get mined for laughs throughout the whole movie, and it did get old after a while. Plot-wise, no new ground was broken either. Everything happens exactly how you expect it to, complete with a last-minute crisis that gets resolved a little too quickly and cleanly. And really, outside of that there really isn't any conflict or reason to care about any of the characters. Still, the musical numbers are quite impressive, and the only reason I'm rating this as high as I am. While the core group, the Barden Bellas, stick to the same songs for the most of the movie, only changing up their act in the final part of the movie, everyone else varies their material and gives it a nice touch. There are a wide variety of songs chosen, and they're performed in visually interesting ways and have good choreography as well. The contemporary soundtrack was also quite good too. Overall, I thought the movie was ok, but nothing to rave about. Despite the great soundtrack and musical performances, the plot is rote and the characters all one-note. It isn't horrible by any stretch, but the only reason to see it is for the music or if you're a GLEE fan.",1406160000,,2142,4.639473684210526

I guess I was expecting something funny, based on what every said about it, but it's just predictable. Plus,the songs they sang were horrible: The Sign & No Digity ?? ugh, I wanted it to stop...OH, and the annoyingly bitter rude and racist (and she was very racist)Korean ""American"" roommate was horrible too.. I don't know if that was resolved by the end, because I finally shut it off after they started singing ""Party in the U.S.A."" on the bus - There are limits as to what I'll watch.. But on a positive note: the shower guy and Luke (the stern campus dj with the light British accent)were cute.. oh, btw, thanks for showing us your flat abs solely for the sake of being shallow and vain .. uh, just like this movie..",1405814400,,1168,4.642512077294686

5196813,5,B008YV11JQ,"I wanted to try the Amazon video streaming so I rented this video and streamed it via my Wii.  Yay! The streaming worked well. I'll did it again and I plain on streaming another movie tonight because I'm too lazy to walk over to the Redbox tomorrow. So it would cost me as much by the time I got my lazy butt over there to return the movie.

The very pleasant surprise was how much I enjoyed watching Pitch Perfect. I can't believe I had never seen it. It wasn't available on Netflix nor in the Redbox. When I saw it was available on Amazon Videos I jumped at the opportunity. I didn't regret it. I LOVED this movie and would easily enjoy watching it again.",1404432000,,657,4.2063492063492065

This is the first movie we bought using Amazon's Prime so we could watch it over the internet (on the Playstation)
It worked perfectly, I was a bit leery how that works, but I am satisfied with it.
We love this movie and repeat the lines randomly all the time. I mean, who doesn't find this addicting?
The music in great and catchy, my daughter loves to sing and dance to it, my husband even loves it.

Movie worked well and didn't stutter or anything, but the DVD case was completely destroyed. The case came within the usual plastic DVD case wrapped in shrink wrap. The DVD plastic case it a very shoddily made one. It is a thin plastic and bents easily, the case was actually bent slightly when I received it as it has yet to fix itself even when I place it squeezed among the rest of my DVDs. I am happy with the movie, but not happy with the packaging, and not happy that the image on the actual DVD disc was distorted. not sure if it's the manufacturer or the seller.",1404259200,,587,4.25

I know this is meant as a young adult comedy and I appreciate the atypical characters (not the usual evil, pretty villain and sugary, sweet heroine) - but it will not survive long past as a cult classic, unlike the reference of ""The Breakfast Club"" in the movie.  Worth watching but when it comes on TV for free.",1404000000,,399,4.4520547945205475

The music is so catchy, and the story line sucks me in every time. It's a movie that entertains if you sit down to watch just to enjoy, and it's also one that lets you do other stuff while it plays, still keeping you there while getting things done.

5196922,4,B008YV11JQ,"I think it really was the accapella work that stood out for me in this flix - especially in the finale.  Story is your typical ""college girl trying to find herself.  She really doesn't develop until she realizes her musical talents.  Again, oK - but my 4 stars are because of the music,",1400889600,,286,4.3584905660377355

Its all of the above and more. Its funny without being raunchy, there's NO SWEARING (Moms, this is awesome for your kids) and it actually sounds really good. I would recommend it!",1400716800,,349,4.147058823529412

5196934,5,B008YV11JQ,I have a category of movies that I call watchable. They may not be all time great movies but they are ones that every so often you can just put in the dvd and watch them and they are as enjoyable as the first time that you have seen them. The western Ride the High Country fits the bill. It is not a great picture but I can watch two or three times a year and enjoy it each time. I enjoyed that this was something I did know anything about. There actually is an a cappella event and it does take place in NYC. The acting was top notch and the music was excellent. I am now awaiting pitch perfect two.,1400457600,,600,3.9262295081967213

Actually, as I am writing this, I cannot even remember much about the storyline.  Obviously, it did not reel me in and for me, does not have a high level of rewatchability.",1400198400,,321,3.953125
5196938,5,B008YV11JQ,This movie was added to my musical collection.  It is ranked my top 5 as #1 still goes to Grease.

Not too mention I never knew she could sing!,1400112000,,306,4.224137931034483
5196939,5,B008YV11JQ,"My daughter, a musician, recommended this movie to me. It is really excellent.  So many movies about something specific (most often a sport or an art) don't get something important right.  Like having someone play a harpsichord and yet the music you hear is obviously a grand piano.  This is perfect, though, maybe because it isn't marred with instruments.  Just humans sing. It is awesome.",1400025600,,390,4.953846153846154
5196940,4,B008YV11JQ,"This isn't a musical exactly but then again, maybe it is. This is a funny comedy with a little romcom thrown in. It is about a Collegiate a cappella singing competition where the men's team has won the National championship and the girls team has only made it to second place. Handing off the baton from one set of Seniors to a new set, the team tries to recruit singers. Due to a bad gross out scene during the last Nationals, the women's team is having a hard time finding their usual caliber of sings, so they begin recruiting. Lot of sex references so not exactly kid friendly. But the story is a good one, the end if amazing. A couple of gross out scenes that are part of the story. The singing is great. So much so we bought the soundtrack.",1399939200,,746,4.26056338028169
5196941,4,B008YV11JQ,We laughed a bit and enjoyed the music. Fun and relaxing without too much drama and meaning. It is definitely worth watching.,1399852800,,125,4.7272727272727275

5196944,5,B008YV11JQ,"I am in love with this movie, totally bought it after I saw I was renting it so many times. It is one of my top musical movies (first one being Moulin Rouge, of course!) Anna Kendrick definitely holds her own leading this movie even though there are so many characters that any one of them could have upstaged her. However, she hangs in there and saves the world, one lyrical remix at a time. Love the songs in the movie, love the plot, love Jesse, and love the ending!",1399593600,,469,4.222222222222222

5196957,5,B008YV11JQ,"This sounded like a ""chick flick"" and my wife and daughter coerced me into watching it.

I've watching several times since... and laugh every time!

When I think of sing-offs I think Travolta and Newton John or West Side Story. Hell, even Drew Carey did a cool sing-off mocking Rocky Horror and Priscilla. This is just horribly lame. The lead character arrives at school with one, count it, one middling-ish bag and sets up a recording studio in her room. Where are her clothes? And why does her roommate seem to hate her from the first second? The characters are caricatures. There's projectile vomiting. Why? The girls don't sing all that well, so how are they competitive?

Now there is a sequel in the works. Yes, it was that good. Elizabeth Banks produces this and play a hilarious role, but the real stars are the actors who learned to sing and dance for this flick. Check out YouTube videos about the movie to get some background, then buy this movie.

The characters are entertaining, the music is great, and there's a lot of humor throughout. Even my husband, who hates musicals and chick flicks, said that he really didn't want to like this movie, but he just couldn't help but like it.

There are some ridiculously over the top moments, a cliched father-daughter relationship, and a bit of gross humor that didn't particularly appeal to me, and that's why I only gave it four stars. But it really is a fun movie and the fun far outweighs the annoying.",1394755200,,589,4.556603773584905

5197050,4,B008YV11JQ,"I adore this movie, and I'm surprised it didn't get more praise than it did.  I thought it was fresh and original, and the singing was so good.  Usually I hate singing in movies, but all of the musical numbers were so stellar.  The cast has chemistry, and I enjoyed Anna Kendrick and Skyler Astin's performances, the latter having an abundance of charisma without being sentimental or smarmy.  I do think it could have been better edited - I loathed the scenes with Becca's father - except for the first scene, they weren't really necessary, and I would have included some of the hilarious deleted scenes I saw on youtube instead.  I wasn't a fan of Rebel Wilson/Fat Amy - her character just didn't work for me, and her singing was mediocre.  I thought both Hana Mae Lee/Lilly Okanakamura, and Alexis Knapp/Stacie Conrad's characters funnier and more quirky.  I didn't like the subplot of Ben Platt/Benji Applebaum at all  - the Treblemakers's performance in the national competition was the weakest I had seen them perform.  Still, it was an enjoyable movie, thoroughly entertaining.",1394323200,2,1084,4.879781420765028

5197054,5,B008YV11JQ,You have to love Fat Amy and the snooty girl who hurls in acapella competition.  The commentary crew will make your sides ache. Anna Kendrick is great as the lead and can she sing?  Music well worth the rental / purchase.,1394236800,,221,4.365853658536586

5197074,5,B008YV11JQ,"This is one of my go-to movies to cheer me up.  It is the ""Bring it On"" of the acapella world, with more grown-up humor.  I've watched it a number of times and catch different little things each time.  The musical arrangements are outstanding, as are the vocal performances.  The comedic timing is dead on too.",1393718400,,310,4.482142857142857

The acting may not be Oscar worthy, nor the writing, but don't expect that going in, just take it for what it is and you will laugh or sing along with the songs! I was prepared to hate this film but now I love it and I can't wait for the sequel to come out!",1393632000,,390,3.8875

5197078,5,B008YV11JQ,"If you like movies with witty humor, this is a great movie.  The actors deliver the lines so well.  And some of the details (props, character development) are really well done - most you wouldn't catch if you aren't paying close attention.  I love movies with happy endings. Ummm, hello???? - that's what the movie industry was built on.  It was historically, a snippet of time where people could escape their lives and immerse themselves into another story .. and honestly, who want's the time you spend watching a movie escape from reality to be sad or a downer or have such a political message, you could have gotten it elsewhere?

A movie with good acting, direction, a wonderful creative team, and GASP! a happy ending.  ...... I'm sold. It is obvious that the entire team putting together this movie are amazing with what they do.  While I don't keep track of most movies and casts and directors (other than my favorites) - I gave this one a try & I was glad I did!",1393459200,,971,4.514285714285714

Every time we watch it we end up running around singing the songs.  My husband would kill me if he knew I said this, but at his fire department, the firemen sit around and watch this movie often!!

Great movie for a night of mindless entertainment!!",1393200000,,399,4.424657534246576
5197091,5,B008YV11JQ,"Hello, I'm a heterosexual male in his early twenties and I love Pitch Perfect. When there's nothing else on and I want some background noise that I can laugh at when I hear a certain line or catch a certain scene, its usually this movie. Its funny as hell! Some complain, saying the story is predictable. ""Will they win in the end or will they end up together?"" Hell, you can probably answer those questions correctly without having seen this movie. But what some call predictability, I call familiarity. Its a paint by numbers plot for sure, but I think knowing where the story's going gives you more room to let loose and laugh easy. But that's not to say that this movie isn't devoid of surprises. Oh no! Going by the trailer, you can't imagine how charming and funny this movie will be. Its complete with Hangover type humor, but never too raunchy or over the top (well, maybe a few parts). Pitch Perfect has really engaging characters, a surprisingly catchy soundtrack and plenty of light, fun laughs to keep you entertained each time you watch it! Truly a breath of fresh acapela air!",1393200000,,1090,4.5948717948717945

Okay, I am a sucker for  love stories because I'm 19. But my mom who is 41, liked it. My father, a truck driver, who is 60, LOVED this movie. Even my little brother liked it. I think its great how not everyone looks the same. They have people of all shapes and colors. Not a lot of people in this movie were professional dancers but they look flawless.

I love the fact that the main character is flawed, and sometimes not very likeable, so that you really get to see her grow as a person. The characters are fun and the movie is hilarious. Sometimes my son will come up to me and say, ""Mom, we haven't watched our movie in a while..."" He loves to run around the house singing the songs. It is a wonderful, feel-good movie, that almost everyone can enjoy. (I say ""almost"" because there are some fuddy-duds out there who don't enjoy much of anything.)",1392681600,,596,4.330357142857143

We had seen it at a store & she really wanted it just for the sunglasses,  she's 22 but I got a cool pic of her wearing the glasses.

5197294,5,B008YV11JQ,"I cannot believe I waited so long to watch this movie! I freakin' LOVE IT! So much fun.

Anna Kendrick stars as Beca, a disenchanted college student who dreams of leaving school as soon as possible and moving to L.A. to try her hand as a D.J. Her father, a professor at the college she's attending, promises to support her dream if she gives college a real try for at least a year. Compelled by her dad to get involved, Beca joins the Bellas, an all-girls a cappella group. The Bellas are in a bit of a rebuilding year after an embarrassing performance the prior semester in which they lost the international a cappella singing competition to their rivals, the college's all-male singing group, the Treblemakers.

Unfortunately, Beca finds that the Bellas are a bit old-fashioned in their way of thinking, performing outdated standards that will never vault them to the top of the competitions. Beca attempts to spice things up in the group, all while fighting her growing attraction to Jesse (Skylar Astin), a member of the Trebles.

I cannot say enough great things about this movie. It's super fun, well-written, and hilarious, with great performances all-around. And the singing is so awesome!!! ""Pitch Perfect"" is a must-see, and it's a movie I will be adding to my permanent movie collection.",1388534400,,1298,4.837837837837838
5197295,5,B008YV11JQ,"A fun celebration of music.  Don't overanalyze or try to find profound meanings; just laugh, enjoy, and sing along with the amazing musicians. Especially enjoyable - the ""riff off,"" singing on the bus, and the finale.",1388534400,,217,5.027777777777778

5197297,3,B008YV11JQ,"Anna Kendrick is so full of life, endearing and multi-talented:  singing, dancing and acting up a storm.  The women singer Belles were wonderful.  The story is thin but enough to hold the musical numbers together.  Some of the humor was too juvenile, but other parts made you smile.  We enjoyed the movie, mostly for the music and Anna Kendrick!",1388448000,,345,4.779661016949152
5197298,5,B008YV11JQ,"This is such a great movie for so many different people. If you're a guy and you want to buy a movie for a girlfriend that you're not going to hate watching, get this movie.

5197301,5,B008YV11JQ,"Must admit when I first saw the previews I wasn't that excited or impressed. I'm a female but just don't enjoy a lot of chick-flicks, the same boring girl is missing something in her life until she meets boy, boy and girl are total opposites and completely wrong for each other, but they ride off into the sunset. Wah wah. I was so wrong to think this movie fit that formula! Yes, it does have the unhappy girl who meets boy aspect, but it's sooooo much more. Mainly, more laughs- this movie is HILARIOUS. Belly laughs hilarious. And the music is fun. Perfect if you want to be entertained, or as a gift for friends or family members who are big on comedy and feel good movies.",1388448000,,677,4.338582677165355
5197302,4,B008YV11JQ,"Ok, I've watched this too many times. And honestly, I admit that now I pretty much fast forward and just watch the musical bits. That alone is worth it.

5197305,5,B008YV11JQ,"This movie is great for an evening in with the girls, where you just want to laugh, and maybe fall in love a little bit. It's not realistic at all, but that's not what this sort of movie is for. I especially like the jabs at Glee.",1388361600,,230,3.9148936170212765
5197306,5,B008YV11JQ,One of my all time favorite movies. Its absolutely hilarious and the songs are fantastic. Brings me back to my old choir days. Finally had to cave and download the soundtrack because the songs kept getting stuck in my head!,1388361600,,223,4.6

A lot of people aren't aware of the sub-culture of collegiate a-cappella, and this does a decent job of highlighting it, through the eyes of a novitiate. Although I would have been just as happy with more of a documentary-style of shooting behind the competition, rather than the typical outsider protagonist who reluctantly becomes a hero and saves the day and gets the boy in the end, this was an entertaining and musical diversion. A little vomit-intensive, and some of the jokes are a bit juvenile, but on the whole good entertainment value for the money.",1387152000,,617,5.0

5197369,5,B008YV11JQ,"I had NO idea what a fantastic movie I was about to watch when I rented PitchPerfect.  I was looking for something other than the dark dramas that are the rave the last few years, and I'd just read Anna Kenndrick's IMDb bio, so I had to give this movie a try.  What I thought would be an entertaining movie turned out to be an INSTANT addition to the list of my all-time ""Best Movies I Ever Saw"" list.

PitchPerfect is an extraordinary, sensational musical comedy-drama - a total surprise hit.  It has a solid plot, genius blend of actors and actresses that represent the quirks, humor, talent, personality traits that anyone can relate to - blended to present a visually artistic, inspiring, and unforgettable experience for the audience.  I have watched the movie almost 30 times already - and each time, it makes me laugh, and feel those warm fuzzies and goosebumps during the outstanding climax.

It is SO hard to find an artistic and inspirational movie these days, especially regarding music and dance, portraying the depth and inspiration of a character who attains the dream of reaching their full potential of their natural talent.  This movie delivers that promise with an awe-inspiring, unexpected thrilling cilmax that'll have you cheering, jumping up and dancing with them, sharing in the joy of their success.

I cannot finish my review without mentioning the following worthy ""traits"" that made this movie such a hit:
1.  Rebel Wilson is FANTASTIC, hysterical, lovable - personifying the human nature to overcome one's tendency to feel self-conscious when life hasn't dealt you what society values today.  SHE is beautiful, funny, extremely self-confident, and in-touch with herself, exemplifying that we each are special, unique and very worthy if YOU believe you are.
2.  Gail and John, the ""DJ's"" for the Acapella competitions are a total RIOT!  Listen carefully to their witty commentary.
3.  Anna Kendrick displays yet more of her exceptional talents - not just acting, but what a voice!
4.  Aubrey and Chloe - ALL the Barden Bellas have amazing voices!  The same goes for the Treble-makers.

I'm so glad they are making a sequel, and so looking forward to it.  This movie is sure to be a hit for ANYONE and everyone.",1386633600,,2237,4.891246684350133

But what I watched was cliches based on past musical shows/movies and mean spirited people with some vomit and raunch thrown in.

I was disappointed. I wish I'd bought the soundtrack instead because there is some decent music at the edges. But don't be expecting Pentatonix. There's no one of that caliber in the movie.",1386547200,2,512,4.494623655913978

5197393,5,B008YV11JQ,"I LOVE this movie!  The characters are relatable (if a bit over the top) and the music is super catchy (I find myself mumbling the words and humming the songs days after I watch it).

There are a few ""gross out"" moments that I feel aren't necessary for the overall plot of the movie, but now that I've seen it more than once, I just fast forward through those parts.

The Blu-ray offers a crisp HD picture (I gave the DVD disc to a co-worker since keeping both seems silly - especially with the digital and ultra-violet copies!) and I love the extra features.  I've watched both commentaries and I like the one that includes the director, Jason Moore, and producers Elizabeth Banks and Max Handelman.

if you're a fan of a cappella, Rebel Wilson, or gross out humor involving chicks, consider Pitch Perfect your one stop shop.",1385942400,,826,4.554054054054054
5197394,2,B008YV11JQ,"When I saw this movie on store shelves, I assumed it was yet another ""High School Musical"" knockoff -- and since that movie didn't exactly impress me, I avoided this one.  Only when a family member raved about the movie and told me it highlighted that oft-overlooked subgenre of music known as acapella, I decided to give it a shot.  I love acapella music, and was curious to see how this movie would portray it... as well as to hear the songs, especially those by an all-girl acapella group (a rarity in the genre).

I came away from this movie rather disappointed.  Yes, the songs are fun and catchy, but the rest of the movie is a clichd, over-the-top mess.  And it seems like the movie doesn't know whether to take itself seriously or play up the camp, and so settles for a whiplash-inducing mix of both.

At first the movie starts to follow an all-female acapella group known as the Bellas, as they botch the finals of an intense competition by virtue of the soloist throwing up rather graphically onstage.  Then the movie instead switches to Becca, a reluctant college student who wants to be a DJ but is being pushed into school by her estranged father, who's paying her way through college.  When one of the Bellas overhears her singing in the shower, she convinces her to audition for the Bellas, and Becca makes the cut... only to find herself constantly at odds with Audrey, the Bellas' controlling leader who insists that they sing the same songs at every show despite said songs boring their audience to tears.  Becca unexpectedly warms up to the eclectic mix of girls among the Bellas, including a shy girl prone to whispering creepy phrases, a possible lesbian, and a girl who proudly dubs herself ""Fat Amy"" for obvious reasons.  But when Becca falls for a member of the Bellas' competition the Treblemakers, butts heads with Audrey one too many times, and has her dreams of DJ-hood dashed by her father, she finds herself cut off from her newfound friends... but is determined to help them make it to the finals anyhow.

By far the best part of this movie is the songs.  While they're all covers, all the bands cover the songs well... and totally without instruments, relying on the human voice to provide vocals, accompaniment, and even drums.  Even if you're not a fan of acapella music, you'll enjoy these songs, which range from '80s to hits of the modern day.

The storyline, if you couldn't tell from the above synopsis, is a mess.  The movie can't seem to decide if it's about the struggles of girl trying to follow her dreams despite pressure from others, or about a group of mismatched misfits trying to succeed.  It tries to be about both, and sadly both storylines suffer from the film trying to juggle both.  I would have much preferred it if the film had picked one or the other and focused on it.  And on a writing-related note, the humor seems to focus on either puns on the word ""acapella"" (""aca-awkward,"" ""aca-serious,"" ""aca-amazing,"") etc., or on vomit jokes.  The former is far more eyeroll-inducing than funny, especially since the puns are delivered in perfect seriousness and without any hint of humor or irony... and the latter is just disgusting instead of funny.

The characters are what really kill the movie for me.  They're all either incredibly bland (such as Becca's love interest) or, far more often, annoying to the point where they grate on the nerves.  Becca and her Korean roommate are unlikable, Fat Amy is far too over-the-top to be believable, the announcers of the competition have mean and nasty senses of humor, and Audrey and the male leader of the Treblemakers are both obnoxious and hateful characters.  In the case of the latter two I suppose one could make the argument that they're antagonists and are supposed to be obnoxious, but they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and that bothers me.  Even the love interest's nerdy roommate is bland, serving no point to the plot and having no personality outside his love of magic tricks and obsession with Star Wars and the Treblemakers.  The one character I liked was the shy, creepy girl, who has some of the best lines in the movie (though you have to turn on subtitles to understand what she's saying).

I suggest passing on this movie and going for the soundtrack instead.  It's too adult-oriented for the ""High School Musical"" crowd, but is too clichd and mean-spirited for most others to enjoy.",1385942400,3,4414,4.713541666666667

5197405,5,B008YV11JQ,"I'd like to say I hated this movie - that as a grown woman I found it trite. However, it won me over. Is it silly and a bit immature and totally predictable? Yes. But it's still adorable and my 10 year old daughter loved it. (The language is a bit much for a 10 year old - but I don't mind that as much as when movies have overt sexuality and this has nothing but a kiss)",1385683200,,371,3.769230769230769
5197406,1,B008YV11JQ,"This is a bad mix of Glee and all cheap college comedies you've seen.
Rebel Wilson is the only actress, who saves this boring movie. I have bought the movie just to see her playing in it, and she was worth it. Pity, that she doesn't play the lead.",1385596800,2,247,4.061224489795919

5197415,5,B008YV11JQ,Have seen this on TV and thought it was well made with some very talented singers. I think modern Acapella is great with a little story line with it. Ms. Banks produced an up beat movie.,1385251200,,186,4.194444444444445

5197430,2,B008YV11JQ,"This movie has some cool music, but is pretty trite. I wanted to show it to my middle school music students, but it had too many un-funny sexual remarks in it to be appropriate. That's a shame , because the mentality it would attract would be middle school age. I wish that it were more appropriate for kids. The plot is pretty juvenile, but the jokes and curse words make it inappropriate for kids .",1384732800,,400,4.346666666666667

5197451,5,B008YV11JQ,This Movie is so funny! Fat Amy is my hero! This movie is to Bring it On as Cabin in the Woods is to Evil dead. A play on a cliche.,1383868800,,131,3.2580645161290325

5197458,4,B008YV11JQ,"This movie really surprised me.  It has some great lines and fun songs.  Anna Kendrick does a great job acting and singing.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the puking scenes.  The excessive puking was disturbing to watch and could have been replaced with something else (belching, perhaps).  Those are only two scenes in the movie, though, so it didn't affect the likability it too much.",1383523200,,417,4.581081081081081

I think there's something wrong with these blu ray dvds.  If I pause the movie, I can't continue in the same spot.  I have to get it to restart then fast forward.  I've tried two of these with the same problem.  It's not my player as I don't have the problem with any other dvd.  It's no problem now that I know I can't pause it.",1383350400,,506,3.9405940594059405

5197465,5,B008YV11JQ,"This movie does not take itself seriously in anyway but it is seriously entertaining! If you like chick flicks this is the way to go. It has everything plot wise. Girl trouble, Musical interludes, Making friends, Personal Growth, Boy trouble, A road trip, A competition, and funny commentary. The music is awesome! I still can't figure out who really created Becca's Mixes but I am dying to get my hands on them.",1383177600,,412,4.736111111111111

The music is very catchy and I always find myself singing the music at least once a week. I got the Blu-ray copy and it did come with an iTunes and Ultraviolet copy. I actually downloaded the movie on my phone once during a long car drive and had the movies playing through the speakers and it's just as fun because the music is well placed and diverse.

And even better, this movie is hilarious. It takes a lot these days for a movie to make me really laugh out loud hard and Pitch Perfect did that several times. I made everyone watch it and they loved it.",1382659200,,376,4.544117647058823

I lived with a college acapella group through college and loved it and though they did change up how easy it is for songs to come together (as was necessary for the cohesion of the movie) it otherwise reminds me so much of that time and those people. Singing through every day really does make the day better.

It's not a new story, but the musical numbers are so well done as to make the movie enjoyable to watch. Or you can just fast-forward (scene select) to the musical parts. I do recommend watching all the way through at least once as there are some funny parts.",1382227200,,467,4.7073170731707314
5197504,1,B008YV11JQ,"The one star, aside from being the minimum rating option, is for Rebel Wilson and a couple of the better musical sequences. I doubt that the music actually had much true a capella authenticity in its recording, but it generally sounds good and works as fantasy ear-candy. Other than that, however, this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen, in my personal opinion. Someone with different tastes than mine might find a lot here to like, but I find virtually no redeeming value whatsoever, and surprisingly little in the way of actually funny humor.

The dialog is extremely lazy and clichd. The characters are extremely stereotypical (in the offensive, one-dimensional sense, not the effectively simple archetype sense) and clichd. The plot is predictable. The music, while fairly decent on the whole, is rarely transcendent, edgy or spectacular in my opinion. It is okay, but this film would have benefited from it being spectacular. The humor is often gross-out and/or highly sexualized. That may or may not be objectionable or palatable depending on the viewer. The more universal problem with the humor, again in my personal opinion, is that it is rarely funny. The exception to that is Rebel Wilson, who is endlessly entertaining, but she alone cannot save Pitch Perfect, try though she might.

Is this film a satire? Maybe it is, but I would suggest that it fails to be an effective satire just as it fails to be an effective straight film. Nearly everything about it is lazy, cheap and uninspired. Not worth the time or money. That is my take.",1382140800,3,1560,4.8389513108614235

5197520,5,B008YV11JQ,"This is one of my favorite movies. I enjoyed it at first because it was one I could watch with my kids, nothing too bad or racy in it.  But I enjoy the songs and the romantic storyline as well.  They have grown tired of it, as kids tend to do, but I have watched it over and over to the point my kids think I'm nuts.  It's not perfectly written from a screenwriter's point of view, but it's pretty close.  There are also a few lines that more or less get thrown away because of the speed and volume at which they are said--I am the type who will rewind and even put on the subtitles for one sentence to see what I missed--but it's not a big deal.  While the cast is good, Rebel Wilson steals the show in almost every scene she is in.  Sometimes she's a little awkward, but it just adds to her character.  I also think it sends a good message to see a big girl fitting in at college, even if Wilson's humor tends to the self-deprecating (she calls herself Fat Amy, but at least she lives life on her own terms.)  I would recommend this as a family movie, and it seems the elementary age and early middle school set seem to gravitate toward it.",1381708800,,1142,4.089686098654709

5197522,5,B008YV11JQ,"I watched this movie for the first time almost by chance. Then I bought the BluRay and watched it about a dozen times. Then I bought the sound track to listen to in my car. The message is--if you like music, especially a capella music, this movie is addictive. And if you don't know whether you like a capella music, watch this movie and you will by the time you are finished.

This movie has a great deal beyond the music to offer. The story is charming, and although in a way it's very predictable, the path through the tale is immense fun. The characters are delightful and quirky. And watching Audra attempt to mold her new crew of diverse and... unusual... new singers into a clone of the previous version of the Barden Bellas is hilarious. The phrase ""herding cats""  applies nicely.",1381622400,,788,4.503496503496503

I'm never truly happy unless I'm singing, so this movie hit the right chords. And ANYONE would enjoy this. Amy (fat Amy, she calls herself, (from ""bridesmaids"") seems to get the best one liners but the whole movie is just fun and you begin getting anxious for the ending, because you know it's going to be kick-arss! And it was. A movie everyone should have in their library. Also, I believe it will be and is Anna Kendrick's come out movie. Will be keeping an eye out for her and the blonde- Skylar Astin (from True Blood).  Her ""Too controlling"" attitude comes to a head, hilariously so when the red head- Rebel Wilson, goes for the pitch pipe. One of the best scenes and there are many. Don't miss this.

This is quickly becoming a classic for our time, with so many great one-liners.  One viewing will hook you!",1380672000,,423,3.9411764705882355

5197576,4,B008YV11JQ,The movie turned out better than I expected. If you love acapella you'll love this movie. The songs choose for the movie was good. The quality was good.. It only skipped once during the entire movie.,1380067200,,199,4.555555555555555
5197577,4,B008YV11JQ,"It's the musical for today's day and age. It's pretty cheesy, and they have some gross out scenes that I think were completely unnecessary. This movie wasn't made to be taken seriously. It was made to laugh and have fun. In that respect they succeeded. If you like people breaking out into song, I say give it a go.",1380067200,,315,4.3559322033898304

5197583,5,B008YV11JQ,"While the premise may be similar to so many older films (i.e. any movie about dance groups, etc.), this one manages to play out on a much higher level.  The acting is smooth, even during ""awkward"" college moments, and the songs and performances are very well done.  Catchy tunes sung well - a good combination.",1379980800,,310,4.618181818181818

5197587,3,B008YV11JQ,"I ordered this for my daughter and a friend and figured it would be heavy on the cheese. I was right. However it also had cute moments and funny moments and ""awww"" moments.  Unfortunately, it also contained questionable, inappropriate moments that were NOT tucked into that ""right over her ten year old head"" place.  I don't believe in raising  a child in a bubble so those moments weren't  quite raunchy enough to fast forward or stop it all together.  Overall, it was cute enough to watch it with them ( the friend is 13) and get in some quality time.  I think it is important to show interest in what your children are interested in even if it is a sappy teen film.  Mission accomplished.",1379808000,,691,4.48
5197588,4,B008YV11JQ,"This movie is pretty fun to watch.  Not a lot of plot and what is there is quite predictable, but it's quite entertaining.  I love hearing these groups sing.  Actually, I think they should have included more performances.  We ultimately bought the soundtrack but it would have been nicer if it had more complete performances.

Not the most profound move but good fun.  My wife really liked it...a lot more than I did, actually.",1379808000,5,427,4.702702702702703

5197593,5,B008YV11JQ,"This is one you will watch over and over if you are a music lover.
The music in this is better than its original counterpart.
This movie has you watching movies and listening to music you never were interested in before.

A young standoffish girl goes to college only to please her father with out intending to really participate.
Her dad pushes her to get involved and she finds that she actually can (slowly and painfully) like being around people.

There are just no words to express how awesome this movie is.

The rest of the cast including the 3 ""other girls"" in the group are great and the performance numbers by both the women and the men show the work they put into them. Watch the inappropriate dialog section.",1379635200,,264,4.408163265306122

I can see why the kids today would identify so strongly with ""Pitch Perfect"".  This saga of a women's competitive collegiate a cappella group is predictably plotted but compensates with a resounding energy and joyfulness.  I'm fifty and my wife isn't quite fifty yet but we both loved it her more than I.  This movie is fun for all ages or those who are chronically immature like myself.",1379635200,,536,4.659574468085107

5197602,5,B008YV11JQ,"This film was a fun watch! In addition to being so unique & entertaining, it was also a great study about this Millennial generation. The interactions between these students and the lives they lead are vastly different from those of the Brat Pack. Of the seven core traits of Millennials (special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving), these students exemplified them all in one manner or another. The interpersonal relationships & group dynamics give life to these characteristics through romantic relationships & a cappella competitions. From feeling pressured to perform without fault, to following leaders without question, these students are without a doubt a study in contrasts with older generations. Fortunately, this film is still accessible to these other generations & can even be used as a way to orient oneself in relation to how these students live and thrive.",1379376000,,914,5.48936170212766

They showed them learning the dances and interacting with each other and the people behind the scenes such as make-up and choreographers.  Why was this not on the extras section?  They have a VERY lame compilation of fans and a few of the actors singing Kelly Clarkson's, ""Since You've Been Gone"".  It was poorly done and really irritating.  Most of the extra's had to do with the character Benji.  Come on!  They do have a extra about the burrito scene, but it's really not the interesting.  Great movie, but don't buy for the extra's.",1378425600,,709,4.592

Now, however, I am trying to sort out who sings what part during the 10 (not kidding) part harmony numbers. The leads are all great but, before becoming a PP geek, I had no idea that Ester Dean was such a huge force in the music industry or that Kelly Jakie was on 'The Sing-Off' for two seasons.

The performance scenes are amazing, and what really blew me away was the talent of these already known actresses - Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Brittany Snow specifically.  I was shocked that they were singers as well!  Anyway, there are always going to be nay-sayers who hate everything, but really, if you want a fun hour and a half where you don't have to think too hard and can laugh REALLY hard - plus see some great song remixes - watch it.

5197661,5,B008YV11JQ,"Pitch Perfect is a funny, romantic, and entertainingly sexy movie. Beca (Anna Kendrick)is sexy in her dark eye liner and punkish look. And to top that off, she has vocal skills that are natural and sultry. Her connection/back and forth with Jesse(Skylar Astin),who is even sexier and as equally talented as she is, is the highlight of the movie to me, along with their on stage performances. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) is hilarious through out. I love her character and the way she commits to a role. She is an awesome actress. Pitch Perfect has romance for the ladies and comedy for the men.

At first I wasn't really interested in seeing it, despite my slightly creepy love for Anna Kendrick (she's my pretend best friend who doesn't know I'm alive).  But I finally Netflixed it and before I had even finished the movie, I was ordering a copy for myself from Amazon.  I'm pretty sure I watched it 6 times the first week I owned it.

I'm not much of an acapella fan but the numbers were fun. Who doesn't love 80s hits mashups? The humor is raunchy sometimes and in some places oddly-placed but funny! The acting is average but Brittany Snow and Anna Kendrick kill it. They know they're in a silly movie and they don't take it too seriously.

5197706,4,B008YV11JQ,"I was impressed with this movie. I had low expectations, but this movie is up higher on the stick than the high school musicals that have been released in recent years. Though in the beginning, the main a Capella group of the movie has some blending issues, I stayed tuned in and was satisfied in the end.

The voices are good, the music is good, the story is believable and semi-interesting. If you like musicals in general, this movie will not let you down.

An unexpected (on my part, anyway) plus was the humor infused into the plot. The previews make it look a little funny, but it's a bit funnier than that, I think. I was laughing out loud a whole lot more often than I expected.

I feel like the preview/trailer here on Amazon represents it pretty well. If after watching it, you think you might enjoy this movie, I'd place money on you being surprised with how much you actually do enjoy it.

I highly recommend for fans of modern musicals with a bit of comedy included.",1376697600,,979,4.4222222222222225

However if more films were available to be see for free with prime membership, it seemed that all the movies I wanted to see weren't available to see for free.

Pitch Perfect is set at the fictional Barden University, featuring the rivalry between an all-male a capella group, 'The Treblemakers' and an all-female group, 'The Barden Bellas'. The protagonist is Beca Mitchell, played by the talented Amy Kendrick. Beca wants to be a DJ and move out to LA, much to the chagrin of her father, who is a professor at Barden. He strikes a deal with Beca, that she must participate in one college activity and if after one year, she doesn't find it fulfilling, he'll finance her trip to the west coast.

'Pitch Perfect' is most successful, when the music groups are performing their a capella numbers. The film begins with the introduction of The Treblemakers and The Barden Bellas at the national a capella finals at Lincoln Center in NYC, during the previous semester. Aubrey, the strident co-leader of the Bellas, ruins their chances when she throws up on stage (the workaholic and seemingly in control Aubrey, obviously can't stand the pressure).

Act 2 begins nicely when the a capella auditions begin at Barden, each candidate singing parts from Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone'. Desperate for members, the Bellas end up selecting a group of odd balls, including Beca, who comes in late for the audition, only to wow the audience by singing a folk-rock tune, with a cup as a percussive accompaniment. There's also 'Fat Amy' (Rebel Wilson from 'Bridesmaids'), Stacie, a self-admitted nymphomaniac, Cynthia-Rose, a lesbian with a gambling problem and Lilly, who sings so softly, no one can hear her (she later is revealed to have talent as a beat boxer).

There are a number of scenes in 'Pitch Perfect', where the film's scenarist, Kay Cannon, veers away from the music and bores us with dialogue heavy narrative. A good ten minutes could have been cut from those scenes which involve the initiation of the new members of each a capella group as well as the following scene, some kind of 'mixer', where the boys and the girls get a chance to interact.

It's at this point where the love interest begins in earnest, with Beca rejecting the advances of Jesse, who has just been selected to be one of the new members of the Trebelmakers. Jesse initially bores Beca with some dull zombie conversation but eventually woos her by appealing to her romantic, visual nature (first, he hides his face with a set of old record albums; later he convinces her to watch old movies (which is not her thing), especially the 80s film, 'The Breakfast Club'. In the finale, Beca utilizes the 80s hit, 'Don't You (Forget about me), the key song in 'The Breakfast Club', which helps the Bellas win the final competition.

The Bellas manage to get by in the regional competition, after one of their competitors, lamely feature Muppets, as part of their performance. The scuffle between the Treblemakers and another group afterward, goes on a little too long, and Beca ends up getting arrested after sticking up for her schoolmates. Jesse also infuriates Beca after he calls her father. The conflict between Beca and Aubrey escalates, as the latter wants her mates to wear the same uniforms and perform the same songs, they've used before.

The dark moment of Act 2, occurs when the Bellas lose in the semi-finals. Beca infuriates Aubrey because she did a little improvisation during their final number and quits the group. Beca must do some soul-searching and she finds it watching 'The Breakfast Club'. She's now receptive to her father (no longer rebelling) and agrees to rejoin the Bellas.

It should be noted that Cannon's screenplay contains two moments of outright political incorrectness. First there's Beca's dour Korean roommate, who for some reason seems to dislike non-Asians. Then there's the black lead singer of the Footnotes, who's disqualified from the finals because he's not a high school student. This is the reason why the Bellas get a second chance to sing at Lincoln Center in the finals.

Meanwhile, there's an additional sub-plot which I failed to mention before. Bumper, the Treblemaker's egotistical lead singer, quits after being offered a gig as a backup singer to John Mayer. That allows, Jesse's quirky roommate, Ben, a magician, to realize his dream of singing for the Treblemakers.

The finale isn't very hard to figure out. Beca is appointed the leader of the Bellas and they adopt her new costumes and arrangements. In a rousing face-off, both groups perform magically, but the Bellas have the edge, with Beca leading the way.

'Pitch Perfect' is an enjoyable, musical treat, featuring some fantastic a capella arrangements of both contemporary hits as well as classics from an earlier time in the rock/pop era. As for the story, it goes on for about twenty minutes too long and some additional, judicious editing, could have markedly improved the storyline. I would recommend seeing 'Pitch Perfect' and purchasing the soundtrack.",1375920000,,4925,4.957575757575758

However , the dialogue is hard to hear in one of the small scenes, it gets blurry during some parts of the movie. The last and most annoying is how the movie seems to just stop at or near the last scene every time I watch it on my Kindle fire.  I don't know if it's issue with that is, mine or Amazon's.

5197845,5,B008YV11JQ,"I can't believe it has taken me almost a year to watch this for the first time but I loved every moment, song, and "" A Ca"" references in this movie. Pitch Perfect for me is simply a great movie. Oscar worthy? No, but simply a great movie that I can watch over and over again because of its cast and musical talents. It has the good beats and the comic relief. After I watched it for the first time, I was so happy that it was not one of those high school guilty pleasure movies. This movie takes place during college (best four years of anyone's life) and it never loses any momentum. Anna Kendrick?! I would never have guessed that she has a ca-awesome singing voice after watching her in the Twilight saga. Rebel Wilson, classic funny. I would continue with all the actors/actresses but that would take forever to write.  I don't think you would regret purchasing or renting this movie.",1373673600,,888,4.414634146341464
5197846,5,B008YV11JQ,"As a former A Capella group member, this movie brought back a ton of memories.  Though not original in the sense of the teen romance, its focus on a group of women is refreshing when compared to teen flicks like the American Pie series.  The film includes brilliant singing (all completed by the cast of actors who were not professional singers), entertaining comedy, and a gross-out moment for two. In short, it's light-hearted fun and great for anyone who wants to relive the musical experience that high school and college can be about.

Then it started showing on HBO & I decided to watch it again, then again, then again, then again.  I fell in love with this movie.  I'm singing Cups all the time.  Fat Amy is probably my favorite character in this.  Rumor Willis is amazing in this movie. Of course I love Anna Kendrick & I couldn't help but wonder if she really is anything like her Character Beca?  I tell everyone that if they haven't watched this yet, watch it.

I watched it and ended up loving it! It is absolutely hilarious. It reminded me of a mixture of Bridesmaids (little cleaner) and Mean Girls. I, in turn, made my sister who also hates musicals and singing-movies watch it. She laughed throughout the entire movie, too.

This is a movie that is funny without trying too hard to be. The highlight of the story for me is definitely Rebel Wilson.

 I do not recommend this movie for young children or pre-teens, though. It is a little cruder than I expected. But, I am 21 so it is appropriate for me!",1373414400,,686,4.3023255813953485

The funny moments are very funny and the singing is great. I only did not rate it as 5 stars because it was not a very deep movie; maybe barely grazing serious moments, but not really.

5197881,1,B008YV11JQ,"It's like a glorified karaoke competition.

If you like Glee you might like this. If you don't like Glee...you'll hate this, very much in fact.

This movie is for people whop actually believe there is a such thing as a cut throat world of singing competitions in college where people dedicate their entire lives to singing and destroying other people's chance at a singing career. Before Glee no one had ever heard of glee club competitions getting so out of whack that people are destroying other people's lives just to get a chance to be the lead of a song that's been sung a thousand times before...and much better by everyone else.

Why have musicals gone the way of using everyone else's music? It's just lazy and plays off the ""hey, I know that song"" factor. ""If you like (insert song title here) you'll love this movie."" Where are modern day Fiddler On The Roofs or Jesus Christ Superstars? Everything's got to be a glorified karaoke competition where everyone is about to stab everyone and run away crying because their life is over if they don't win sectionals.

I dragged my boyfriend along to see it because I've seen my fair share of his movies, so he was due to go see one of mine. Both of us laughed so hard we cried in the movie theatre. I owned the digital copy the day it was released. Currently, we watch this movie once every two weeks or so. There are so many one line zingers that keep you laughing throughout the movie. The more I watch it, the funnier it gets because I notice new things as well. Guys, whatever kind of chick flick you think this movie is...give it a chance when your girl asks you to watch it with her.

I could not stop cracking up the first time I watched it and I'm pretty sure anyone looking over at me saw a grin on my face through the ENTIRE movie!!!!  I went with a feminist girl-friend, my boyfriend (who was somewhat reluctant) and all 3 of us LOVED the movie.  Yes, even the boy, who was pretty reluctant.  To sum up, he told his best friend, ""It's not a movie i would've chosen but it was really good.""  :)  I actually saw it again in theatres a second time with another friend, who I needed to convert to the Pitch Perfect cult.  :D

5197921,3,B008YV11JQ,"Well, well, I can see by the thousands of reviews here that PITCH PERFECT has struck a chord.  (I know, bad pun, plus at the rate reviews are posting this one will rapidly disappear from the first page.)  I ran across this light snack the other night on cable, so I tossed the remote across the room and watched this silly, somewhat contrived flick about a ditzy all girls a cappella group compete for the collegiate national singing title.  And their major rival is an all boys group on the same campus.  How gauche!  The girls group is in a rut; their act has grown boring and stale, yet headstrong leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) refuses to take on new material, forcing a girl power revolt, led by talented Beca (Anna Kendrick), and The Barden Bellas get their act together just in time for their climactic performance that brings down the house.  Meanwhile, there's an on-again, off-again romance between Beca and Jesse (Skylar Astin), a member of the rival boy band, that's so predictable you can set your watch to it.

Outside of Kendrick (along with John Michael Higgins and the stunning Elizabeth Banks, who play the announcers at the various a cappella contests), the cast of PITCH PERFECT is unknown to me, yet for the most part turns in enough energy to keep this light offering fresh.  And no complaints whatsoever with all the gorgeous Barden Bellas eye candy; scrumptious.  As an extra bonus, the cast can flat out sing, and many of the cover songs you'll recognize and enjoy as the various groups strut their stuff.  (There's even a song performed from the movie<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Breakfast-Club/dp/B001AEF6BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Breakfast Club</a>, for goodness sake.)  Some of the humor is sophomoric and lame, some of it works, but overall if you're looking for fluff to entertain you for 90 minutes, you can't go wrong with PITCH PERFECT.

I didn't consider it one I would want to own from the previews and I didn't get to see it in theaters.  I watched the trailer and decided that I did want to see it and $13.99 later the movie belonged to me.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.  Having been in choir practically my entire life and even loving Glee as much as I have (until 4th season, then it got boring) I have to say it was right about the same in level of enjoyment.

We slogged through the whole thing and the last 12 minutes were fun, but everything up to that point was painful.  There were lots of opportunities to expand on minor triumphs or a slow evolution of the singing group, individual minor character development.  Instead they had one scene at the very end where the group leadership changes, singing and - end of movie.  A lot could be thrown out too - the mean roommate, the bizarre throwing up, the older singing group and fight scene.

5197952,5,B008YV11JQ,"This movie is just a good time all around.  I have watched it many times and still like it. The middle drags a bit and it is quite formulaic, but still great.",1371427200,,158,3.9375
5197953,3,B008YV11JQ,"Kind of fun. It's like a typical teen drama, but with better writing and great music. If you like Glee, you'll probably like this too.",1371427200,,134,4.4

5197959,4,B008YV11JQ,"Funny movie which is very entertaining.  Aside from the fact that I know it'll be cheaper in the stores a week or two from now, I went ahead and bought it on here anyway... the price one pays to get it sooner.",1371340800,,209,3.9761904761904763

5197962,5,B008YV11JQ,"What a great movie!  The characters are initially stereotypical, but become quite developed and we realize that there is depth to all of them, just as in ""real"" life.  The music is great, and although the script was fairly predictable, it's well worth the time you invest!",1371254400,,272,4.76595744680851

5197967,5,B008YV11JQ,This movie is so funny. You laugh from beginning to end. The singing is great but there is also a story line to follow. You won't go wrong with this one! I watch it over and over again.,1370995200,,185,3.8947368421052633

5197970,5,B008YV11JQ,"When I went to see this movie in theaters, I was frankly not looking forward to it. It had the faint odor of Glee, which is a show I find rather blah. This movie is smart, witty, irreverent, and just hilarious. Rebel Wilson is brilliant, and Anna Kendrick is spot on. If you're in to unconventional comedies like Drop Dead Gorgeous or Best in Show, this flick is right up your ally.",1370908800,,382,4.319444444444445

5197974,1,B008YV11JQ,"I had to go and buy this movie from Best Buy because the version i received from Amazon skips, stalls and won't get through the menus when you hit the menu button.  I confirmed it was not my blueray player by going and buying the same movie from Best Buy.  Clearly this was a knock-off or damaged copy sent to me by amazon.",1370822400,,323,4.111111111111111
5197975,3,B008YV11JQ,When you've run out of other things to watch this is a good fall back movie. Not the blockbuster hit of the decade but it was funny and entertaining.,1370822400,,149,4.172413793103448

5197980,5,B008YV11JQ,"This didn't get a lot of buzz when it came out, I'm assuming there was some other comic book explosion movie around the same time, and it got made invisible. Very quotable, very funny, and caused a whole girl scout troop to sing, mashup and learn the cup flipping trick.",1370736000,,270,4.42
5197981,5,B008YV11JQ,"A lot of fun, the talent, the storyline, something for the not so young and their parents.  Leaves you whistling, and smiling..",1370736000,,127,4.7727272727272725

5197985,5,B008YV11JQ,I've watched this movie many times.  I love the story.  The music is great.  It's up there in my book with movies like Forrest Gump.,1370649600,,132,4.2

5197990,5,B008YV11JQ,Great Movie. Soo funny. The Music is good. I would grade the movie an A+. It makes glee look so stupid.,1370476800,,103,3.9523809523809526
5197991,3,B008YV11JQ,"This was obvious from the get go and I really didn't expect much from the movie, it's directed towards the younger crowd obviously. The singing was good and that's what I enjoyed the most in the movie, no doubt the voices during singing was dubbed in later by a more talented group.
Silly but fun to watch pretty much sums it up for me.",1370476800,,336,4.265625

The throwing up scenes ruined the entire movie for me.

What was left of the movie was slow and boring.
Just songs that no one wants to hear.

Why did the character of Amy allow everyone to call her ""Fat Amy"" as if it were her actual name?
It reminded me of Fat Albert.
And, yet, the ""fat"" black woman was not called fat, even though she was the larger one.",1529280000,,493,4.3478260869565215
