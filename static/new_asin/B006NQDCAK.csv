8501466,4,B006NQDCAK,"This movie was originally titled ""Abandon Ship!"", 1957 film

A ship sinks in the Atlantic Ocean. There is a lifeboat, but not enough room for all. The Captain must decide who shall be saved. The characters of the people are show by their speech. [Stereotypes?] The lifeboat is leaking, they must bail out as well as row to land. The Captain decides who will be sacrificed to save the rest. In the end, another ship arrives to save the survivors.

This drama is based don a true story from 1841. Alexander Holmes was convicted of murder, but given a six month sentence for manslaughter. Does this story reflect the concerns of people over the 1957 recession? Whenever the economy flops, the survivors have to manage to get by. Such times create a market for horror movies (such as the vampire films). [The real vampires are not the monsters of legends, but corporation who are the true living dead.]

The study of a small group and the dynamics of their personalities was the subject of ""Twelve Angry Men"" and other movies. Some war or action movies are also concerned with the interactions of a small group of people. These stories, if well-written, can be better than a bigger budget film with a cast of thousands. Lower budget movies need a small group of actors (to keep costs down). Just watch many of the TV dramas for examples.",1335312000,5,1333,4.639830508474576
