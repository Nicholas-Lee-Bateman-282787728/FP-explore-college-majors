8145969,5,B000IJX6RW,"This film is a very closely observed satire on the relationship of life and art.  Although the nude female form is celebrated, all the eroticism in the film is implied, rather than explicit, which establishes an interesting relationship between the imagination of the viewer and the cinematic image.  The final scene in which the uptight young abstract painter confronts his wife at the airport after two days in which the conventionality of his uncoventionality has been severely undermined, is absolutely hilarious.",1245801600,3,517,5.37037037037037
8145970,3,B000IJX6RW,"This is a British TV movie.  It is based on a short novel of self-consciously literary sort by John Fowles.

This is bubble gum TV, of course, but very high-toned bubble gum TV.  Whatever significance it may have arises from two things.  First, it is a fine example of the non-challenging, easy paydays that the once-great actor Lawrence Olivier solicited in his final days.  Second, Greta Scacchi and Toyah Willcox are stark naked--rather demurely, worse luck!--in a couple of scenes, and Scacchi wears no underwear throughout.

A painter (Olivier), now very old, is whiling away his prosperous dotage at his secluded villa in France.  He lives with two attractive young female models, one of whom is his assistant, possibly a major artist in her own right, and maybe much more than that to the old man.  Both models are perfectly happy to indulge the old goat in whatever erotic adventures still remain within his limited compass.

A younger man (Roger Rees) visits the villa.  He is an established, though less famous artist, one of a more academic bent.  He has come to interview the famous old painter for an article he is preparing.  The old man defends representational painting, criticizing Picasso and his successors for betraying ART.  The newcomer, an abstract artist by inclination, leaps to the defense of Picasso and the others (as though they need such a thing from the likes of him.)  The two combatants wrangle, but without excessive passion on either side.

Before and after these disputes, the younger man is obviously aware of the jiggling girl flesh around him.  We know this because he announces that he is a happily married man--several times, in fact, with each repetition becoming less convincing.  This being a ""literary"" work at heart, with an inevitability that Aeschylus or Euripides would envy, the younger man eventually reaches the hiighly foreseeqble point at which he attempts to make a complete fool of himself.

Olivier offers a little labored jollity but mostly he telephones in his performance.  Rees portrays John Fowles' academic artist as a not very articulate or self-aware cipher.  When he works on his own paintings, one may be sure that his palette will consist of shades of gray.  Scacchi and Willcox are pleasing enough  to the eye, whether clothed or not, although poor Willcox is burdened with a scarlet dye job (or wig) and Goth wardrobe (when she wears anything.)  Despite all the flesh on display, neither of the two women gives off much heat or generates any erotic charge.

The pace of the film is slow.  Its imagery is generally bland.  Sometimes, though, the film manages to be both static and bland.  The whole affair is positively drenched with the respect shown for literary fiction in general and John Fowles in particular.  The expense of spirit in a waste of shame is lust  in action; and till action, lust is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame, savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust--but not here in ""The Ebony Tower,"" alas.  What a waste.

Three stars, a mediocre rating for a mediocre story and mediocre acting.",1186099200,5,3089,4.916827852998066
