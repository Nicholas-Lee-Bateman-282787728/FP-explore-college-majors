8088865,1,B000BMCXZW,"This is not a very good video for cosmetology schools or businesses. It shows the technician double dipping and trying to wipe off wax product with a tissue. Not very sanitary!
This is a no go!",1367366400,,193,4.388888888888889
8088866,5,B000BMCXZW,"This DVD is not only great for established estheticians as another reviewer commented, it's perfect for us newbies too.  Unfortunately my ""school"" didn't teach me a thing about waxing so I had to learn everything on my own.  This DVD gave me the knowledge and confidence to begin offering waxing services safely and perfectly in almost every situation I've encountered.  Highly recommended.",1250294400,3,390,5.258064516129032
8088867,5,B000BMCXZW,"Take it from someone who has been in the esthetics business for a long time, this video is awesome. I bought it to show to the new estheticians are our spa. Most of them said that they learned more from it than from school and all of the estheticians at the spa will you use it for a reference from time to time. It's a really great video and I'm sure you feel the same way.",1207180800,5,374,3.9342105263157894
