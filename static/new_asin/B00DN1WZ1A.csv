Rough plot summary - The Tigers are being ruthlessly exploited by the music industry and dream of having even an hour of free time. A demon appears, and tempts them into contracts that he'll freeze time wherever they're supposed to be and they can play for X hours, but if they don't come back in time, he gets to take their souls. It takes them about 2/3 of the movie to even get to London. They meet Barry Gibb (credited in the preview as  Varry) who wrote their single ""Smile For Me/Rain Falls on the Lonely"".

The plot is both shocking (selling their souls?!) and weakly executed. A lot of the enjoyment comes from seeing the Tigers act weird. Like the part where the Tigers are homeless, broke, and hungry in London, and Julie tries to hide the food opportunity he just found from the other Tigers. That's Sawada Kenji for you! If you're not into Tigers personality politics, or 60s band movies in general, I really don't know if you'll enjoy it. But if you love the Tigers, you will love it!

The color quality is excellent, absolutely bombastic, no problem there. But I could swear the image was squashed horizontally just a little to fit 16:9 (see attached screenshot -- isn't that circle supposed to be...circular? Not elliptical?). The only special features are the original trailer and Poster Gallery. It's Japan region code, so you couldn't play this in the average USA DVD player; the average computer should play it.",1472947200,,1481,4.666666666666667
