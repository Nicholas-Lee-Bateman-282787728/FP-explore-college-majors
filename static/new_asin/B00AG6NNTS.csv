5424216,5,B00AG6NNTS,I watched this movie about 8 or 9  years ago and I had been searching for it ever since.  I was so happy that Amazon had the movie that I ordered it on the spot.  I am in my 60's and this movie is very nostalgic for me.  They don't make them like this anymore.  I am also a collector of movies from my childhood.,1379462400,14,312,3.7384615384615385
5424217,5,B00AG6NNTS,"I've seen most of her films but this is now my very first Esther Williams movie added to my new Old Hollywood DVD collection.  So very glad that I bought this from Amazon based on the positive reviews that I read here.

Esther Williams is absolutely fantastic in this movie!  I LOVE that this is so completely different than all of her beautiful MGM films she is best known for.  Such a wonderful performance!  Beautiful as ever! And after watching this and even though the content of the story is dark & scary, her facial reaction & responses from time to time are priceless! She & her character cracked me the heck up in those subtle, brief glimpses! She's brilliant! :D

I found it very interesting to see how the content/theme of this film was spoke about and handled back then in 1956. And though I admire her nobility in her character in the film, unfortunately we cannot have that in today's world, very sad to say.
Back to Esther Williams, the actress. It really breaks my heart that we lost out on so many more films that could have been, had she not decided to retire at such a young age at the request of her love.

For me, I think one of the biggest missed opportunities is that Esther Williams & Rock Hudson never worked and made films together!!  With their beauty & talent & style of acting, Esther Williams and Rock Hudson would have been a phenomenal pairing on screen!!",1378512000,2,1387,4.454545454545454

I watches it almost every day. This is the first time that I have seen her in
a serious movies.",1378080000,4,162,3.9393939393939394
5424219,5,B00AG6NNTS,Most people say that Esther Williams cannot act but I disagree.  This is a suspenseful movie up to the end.  I also love George Nader & John Saxon.  Both were really handsome men.  I get rather tearful watching due to Esther dying recently.,1376524800,2,240,4.511627906976744
5424220,5,B00AG6NNTS,"Good 1950's type thriller.  Although it may not compare with modern films, this is still a good one, and well worth the time.  Well done film.",1374019200,,142,4.423076923076923
5424221,3,B00AG6NNTS,"This is Esther's first movie after leaving MGM and it is very predictable. We miss Esther in the swimming pool. This is John Saxon's intro and while he is good looking, he displays very little talent. George Nader seems along for the ride as Universal's stock player.",1372464000,,267,4.702127659574468
5424222,4,B00AG6NNTS,"AN enjoyable movie which my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed.
It was interesting to see Esther Williams without a bathing suit on(you know what I mean)",1372464000,,148,4.730769230769231
5424223,4,B00AG6NNTS,"Fresh from her final musical film at MGM (""Jupiter's Darling""), Esther Williams was cast against 'type' in Universal-International's 1956 production of THE UNGUARDED MOMENT, an unsettling little thriller which finds Williams playing a highschool teacher targeted by a depraved sex-fiend.

Ms Williams is Lois Conway, the music teacher at a highschool who has been receiving suggestive notes from a mysterious male pupil.  All signs point to brash star football player Leonard Bennett (John Saxon in his leading role debut), but he turns the tables and accuses Lois of trying to seduce him.  As the police are brought in to investigate the murder of a woman close to the school, Lois is thrown headlong into a terrifying ordeal as her professional reputation hangs in the balance - not to mention her life...

Williams was approaching the end of her film career at this point.  With swimming musicals no longer in fashion, the ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" explored roles out of the water but audiences didn't follow - more's the pity, as Williams actually delivers a very solid dramatic turn in this tight, compact little thriller.  George Nader co-stars as the sympathetic police lieutenant who naturally falls in love with her.  John Saxon (""Portrait in Black"", ""The Reluctant Debutante"") was Universal's own answer to James Dean and makes a very dynamic impression in his first major role - keeping the audience guessing about his true motives, although anybody with half a brain will actually guess who the sex-fiend is LONG before the climax of the film.

THE UNGUARDED MOMENT has been brought to DVD as part of the TCM Vault series.  The film is available as part of the larger&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-in-Danger/dp/B0089EDDNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women in Danger</a>&nbsp;collection (along with some other rare titles featuring Joan Crawford, Ida Lupino and Merle Oberon), or separately on this DVD-R release.",1368144000,9,1973,5.506622516556291
5424224,5,B00AG6NNTS,Good little thriller. It was also great to see Esther out of the water for once.,1419292800,3,80,4.0625
5424225,4,B00AG6NNTS,Somewhat slow but effective thriller that has great elements of noir and was not on my radar before,1418083200,2,99,4.555555555555555

5424227,4,B00AG6NNTS,"I have always liked Esther Williams.  Is isn't the best movie but I enjoyed it for Esther's participation in it.  I want to see anything she has been in and if you are also a fan,  then it's worth the time and $.",1414108800,,212,3.883720930232558
5424228,5,B00AG6NNTS,I saw this movie when it first was released in the movies and liked it very much. Happy to see it a last on dvd.,1411430400,,112,3.52
5424229,3,B00AG6NNTS,"Mediocre print, but a rare occasion to see Esther ""dry"" and rather good in this very dated story.",1406246400,,97,4.444444444444445
5424230,5,B00AG6NNTS,"I first watched this movie when it was released in1956.  All really good performances.  John Saxton at the top of his game. George Nader and Esther Williams perfectly cast.  Based on a story written by Rosalind Russell.
Very suspenseful.  Worth buying.",1398816000,,252,5.073170731707317
5424231,4,B00AG6NNTS,"Same great movie which is a suspense genre, not horror as the synopsis would suggest. My wife asked for this movie and I thought about not getting it because she doesn't like scary movies. The fact that society has changed does not allow you to impose your current view/assumptions on to something made for a different time. Publishers, critics, and the like do this all the time so I guess I should expect it but it's no less irritating. Read a synopsis of the movie elsewhere and then come back and buy it. It's a good story and it's good to see Esther Williams in a dramatic role that involves no swimming. :)",1388707200,2,612,4.424778761061947
5424232,3,B00AG6NNTS,"This film is trashy fun from the overheated 50's. Not going into any ""artistic"" merits or demerits, the DVD offered here with a 2012 release date, should be a disappointment for HD flat screen owners. Though presented in its theatrical 1:85 wide screen aspect ratio, the DVD is NOT ANAMORPHIC: you have to use the Wide Stretch button on your remote in order to cover the entire screen. This from TCM of all companies. Also, this  Universal print tends to favor the blue hues, with over saturated smudgy color. You feel the need to wear glasses in order to watch it. Three stars only because of the DVD presentation and not the film which is an outstanding barrel of laughs - some very serious issues very clumsily dealt with.",1386028800,7,725,4.62015503875969
5424233,5,B00AG6NNTS,"Esther Williams is best known for her swimming roles but in this movie she doesn't go near the water, proving that she can act without her trademark swimming scenes. The high school scenes bring back a lot of memories of the way schools looked at one time. Not only the school but the football team uniforms and helmets as well as the cheerleading uniforms. An entertaining mystery that is not too complicated. This is the movie that introduced John Saxton to the screen. good copy! Another good movie from the 50s.",1379721600,12,515,4.670329670329671

8551289,5,B00AG6NNTS,"I saw this movie when it first came out back in 1956 at the New Mayfair in Philadelphia, and I remember being enthralled by it as a youngster.  When I finally got the chance, I bought it and lo and behold, it still enthralls.  This was worth every penny. The vendor delivered the DVD promptly and in fine condition--clear and colorful.  Highly recommended, both the movie and the vendor.",1475712000,2,387,4.579710144927536
8551290,4,B00AG6NNTS,"Good story & not a stretch, considering that theres always been some sexy teachers. & in this case a male student paying extra close attention to a sexy Esther Williams as the stalked h.s. teacher. But is this student the same one responsible for the sex-fueled attack & murder of another female teacher in the area that has the police investigating the case?  A good mystery drama,  & while wishing that these played longer, I truly liked the then current  2 or 3, 1950's boppin' sax-driven, rock & roll numbers that were big back then.",1474934400,,537,4.631578947368421

8551292,5,B00AG6NNTS,"The Unguarded Moment was released in 1956. Starring George Nader it is a great drama about a teacher who is menaced by a student in school and out. George Nader plays a police lieutenant who tries to help and slowly falls for her. Lots of soap opera action that is very well done. Some creepy touches that you won't easily forget. George Nader is so good looking. He made many films throughout his career. I like these Universal gems. Hope more come out on DVD soon, from their vaults. Ones I'd like to get are, Flood Tide, Appointment With A Shadow, Joe Butterfly, Man Afraid, Four Girls In Town, Congo Crossing, The Second Greatest Sex, Six Bridges To Cross, and Four Guns To The Border. Fans of George Nader will like this the most.",1464480000,,735,4.492537313432836

8551297,4,B00AG6NNTS,"In her first shot after her MGM musical contract ended Esther Williams found a nice taunt little thriller that Rosalind Russell had written for herself in the 1940's and had never made, now too old for the role Universal developed it and the reigns were handed to Esther who did a fine job with it proving she could act.  George Nader played the police detective and love interest, John Saxon, in his second credited role on the big screen, played the student and Edward Andrews really creeped you out as the Dad.  Storyline has a naive high school music teacher trying to help a young male student who made unwanted advances towards her and could be a serial attacker who just killed a woman.  While a handsome police detective enters the picture and becomes romantically involved, the father of the boy and the boy himself slander and try to ruin her reputation costing her her job.  Decent intense drama that has you guessing at times and worth the watch.",1429660800,,958,4.650887573964497
