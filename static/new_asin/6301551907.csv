7813448,4,6301551907,"While this is certainly an effective & enjoyable satire about the empty life of a Soviet bureaucrat, it could just as easily be set in any modern country, because it's an equally effective film about midlife.

When Leonid, resigned to his acceptable but uninspiring marriage to his superior's daughter, has a mild heart attack, he finds new purpose & meaning in his free-spirited nurse Lida (a captivating Tatiana Dogileva). His brush with death has revealed just how useless his life has been up to that point, just how much of himself he's surrendered for his relatively secure (if shabby) position. That reawakened part of his soul yearns for new life, for freedom, for reclaiming the meaningful dreams & aspirations he cast aside for the status quo. But is it too late for him to heed & follow the forgotten tune of the flute?

Anyone who's ever had to deal with a labyrinthine bureaucracy will find plenty to laugh at here -- though the laughter may be a bit hollow & rueful. But anyone who's reached midlife & wondered what happened to all those years, all those abandoned hopes, will feel a deeper pang of recognition. A pity it's still not available on a subtitled DVD.

7813449,4,6301551907,"Good Russian satirical film from the ""Perestroika"" time. Also known as "" Zabytaya Melodiya Dlya Flejty"" (1988). Directed by Eldar Ryazanov: ""Cruel Romance"", ""Garage"", ""The Irony of Fate, or ""Enjoy Your Bath"". Starring Leonid Filatov,  Tatyana Dogileva,  Irina Kupchenko,  Valentin Gaft.
 Leonid (Leonid Filatov) is a high rank bureaucrat in a Soviet bureaucratic agency which has no purpose at all. He is stock between his mistress (Tatyana Dogileva) and his wife (Irina Kupchenko), who happens to be his bosses daughter. At the same time this film shows very good angle of the Soviet life. Bureaucrats with their values: privileges and ""good stuff"" which regular people was not able to buy. And regular Russians with their values: love, family and real friends.
The only one reason why I gave this film 4 stars is ideas ""borrowing"" by the director Eldar Ryazanov (who is one of my favorite Russian directors). Every ""original"" and surprising technique in this film was taken from Luis Bunuel's ""The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie"". But Bunuel's films was banned in USSR and average Russian had no ability to se them. It changed with Gorbachev's ""Perestroika"" and in 1988 ""The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie"" came out on the big screen in USSR just few weeks before ""Forgotten Tune for the Flute"". Ideas borrowing by director E. Ryazanov was too obvioust and it spoiled the effect of his film.
