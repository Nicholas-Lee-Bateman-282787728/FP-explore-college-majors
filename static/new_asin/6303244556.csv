7841663,4,6303244556,"Intriguing Canadian mystery based on a Ross Macdonald novel.  Michael Sarrazin plays a famous journalist named Michael Taylor who ended up in a mental hospital after being captured and tortured by terrorists in the Middle East and then coming home to find his wife raped and murdered.  That last part he remembers nothing about.  His girlfriend Paula (Susan Clark) takes him out of the hospital for what she assumes will be a few days of sex and relaxation but Michael has other ideas.  Now that he's out he wants to figure out who murdered his wife, a crime that is not only unsolved but that didn't yield a single suspect.

One strange thing is that the girlfriend Paula is apparently being blackmailed by an amusingly sleazy man named Lawrence Miles (Anthony Perkins, better than usual).  Even stranger, Paula really doesn't seem to want Michael to figure out who murdered his wife and starts to panic as he gets closer to the truth.

Old Time Radio fans should get a kick out of the fact that Howard Duff (who starred in The Adventures of Sam Spade) turns up as a private eye hired by Michael's doctor to dig up some information about his past.  It's when the gumshoe starts to follow Michael around that Paula first begins to panic.  The stars of SCTV all have cameos even though Deadly Companion is most definitely not a comedy, since director George Bloomfield was also behind the camera for many episodes of that classic series.

Deadly Companion isn't quite a lost classic, but the story is consistently involving and the acting is generally pretty good.  But if you stumble across a copy of the movie don't be fooled by the video box cover--John Candy is in the movie for only a couple minutes (in a cameo as a mental patient) and Anthony Perkins is most definitely a supporting actor rather than one of the leads.  Michael Sarrazin is such an underrated lead he isn't even featured on the cover, but his performance provides a human element that helps to make Deadly Companion a whole lot better than it could have been.  The film may not offer much in the way of style or pacing, but for fans of the genre Deadly Companion is an above average mystery thriller with a couple of nifty twists.",1454889600,,2202,4.615384615384615

7841665,4,6303244556,"Anthony Perkins' performance here reminded me of his portrayal of the husband in ""Five Miles to Midnight"" with Sophia Loren. Tony isn't the star, that would be the low-key Michael Sarrazin, more famous as Jacqueline Bisset's boyfriend than any of his acting roles and Susan Clark of ""Webster"" fame. However, this is a pretty good mystery. The script could have gone a bit farther and made it a film noir, but I didn't guess the ending until it was almost over. If you are a fan of Anthony Perkins, which I assume is the main reason you are looking at this review, then ""Deadly Companion"" will not disappoint. He has a couple of key scenes that you will definitely enjoy.",1347408000,3,670,4.591666666666667
