4684380,1,B005FQ2H1Y,Would have loved to hear this DVD but both were sent and returned with the exact same issue. No Sound.  Manufacture was same so very inferior.  Each had sound for the introduction but once the Live production was to start there was just dead air!,1354060800,,246,4.444444444444445

4684382,4,B005FQ2H1Y,"It;s a very good DVD, would be better if it was a blu Ray. Anyway the performance on stop, look and listen to your heart was fenomenal",1350864000,2,134,4.0
4684383,4,B005FQ2H1Y,"This is a great DVD The quality is good and it's great value
Two for the price of one
Michael is better on 'Tribute to Motown' I think
I was disappointed with his guests on the live cut
India Arie was disappointing
I have followed her ever since she appeared on Oprah with Jill Scott and Alicia Keys
All in all it's worth putting in your collection",1350432000,2,348,4.208955223880597

4684386,4,B005FQ2H1Y,"Fact: I live in Norway and bought this from Amazon.com in the US. The great news is that this plays on my BD as well, and its not region free. So we can all enjoy it even though it says to be region A.

Might be important for people to know that! My tv/dvd is an older model so that might be why I had so much trouble also.  Good concert-some songs are repeated but I really like MM so it's all good now that I can HEAR it!!!",1425513600,,415,4.060975609756097

4684422,2,B005FQ2H1Y,"I love Michael McDonald songs, but the concert was a bit boring.  The guests he had on his show were not that impressive.  I thought the band was very good.  A lot of the songs I recognize, but the whole production was just not what I expected.",1403136000,,244,4.148936170212766

4684425,1,B005FQ2H1Y,Saw him on the Dukes of September tour.  I am experiencing the same issue as others here - no audio and Movie Mars will not accept return of product past 30 days from purchase. It'd be nice if the Michael McDonald camp and their production company would stand behind their defective product.,1391212800,,291,4.596153846153846
4684426,5,B005FQ2H1Y,Michael McDonald at his best. He don't mind sharing the spotlight with other stars that even make him better. Michael's voice stronger than ever.,1390176000,,145,5.083333333333333
4684427,5,B005FQ2H1Y,"If you like Mike Mcdonald, this is DVD tooooo HAVEE!!!! Good video and good sounds providing you have good video and sound system. ENJOY!!!!!!",1385596800,,142,4.958333333333333
4684428,4,B005FQ2H1Y,"If you liked the Michael McDonald era Doobies and Motown songs then this Blu Ray is for you. Great value getting two concerts and on the `Live' disc not only are most of the songs old Doobie songs but `Tom Johnson' and `Pat Simmons' join him for the last half adding guitar and harmonies enhancing what is already an excellent band. Just check out the drummer. She is top class and very funky. The Motown concert also has many guest artists including the late great Billy Preston. Michael has chosen these artists well in that they have soul voices which are a good contrast to his very distinctive and powerful voice and are obviously right at home with the Motown songs.

Sound and video quality are excellent and you can choose your audio preference on each concert individually. So summing it up if you like his voice you'll love this but I know that there are some old Doobies fans out there that would rather eat broken glass than listen to him. I loved all of it.",1383696000,9,970,4.480225988700565
4684429,5,B005FQ2H1Y,"This CD is a must have. It is well produced, very entertaining.  The quality of the picture is great,  and sound is very clear.  The guest artist is the icing on the cake. You really get your monies worth, and its worth every penny. A MUST BUY!!!!!",1380326400,,248,4.23404255319149
4684430,5,B005FQ2H1Y,"I saw Michael McDonald in concert and fell in love with him. I bought the DVD and relived every moment! I fall in love with him again and again, every time I watch the DVD, which is often. He, his band , and backup singers are fantastic!",1377907200,,237,4.0638297872340425
4684431,5,B005FQ2H1Y,"The Blu-ray of Michael covering Motown PLUS the Blu-ray of Michael reuniting with some of the original Doobie Brothers (and others) is VERY well done. Michael delivers AWESOME vocals and shares the stage with several other performers that add to the experience. The musicians are all SUPERB.

For audiophiles, you will be pleased with the audio editing. The 5.1 DTS tracks are well mastered and your audio rig will *LOVE* the high-quality 24-bit audio files. The video is also sufficiently done.

If you enjoy Michael's voice, you must add this Blu-ray to your collection. Worth twice the price!",1377302400,2,595,5.061224489795919
4684432,5,B005FQ2H1Y,"Sorry to see that technical, audio issues dragged the stars down for this show. The program itself is absolutely wonderful, beginning with Michael McDonald. But, besides engaging a full band and orchestra, he called on several guests, including the joyous India. Arie, the rapturous Toni Braxton, the buoyant Billy Preston, and the perfectly placed Take 6, who do a capella on ""Tracks of My Tears"" and a glorious ""Since I Lost My Baby."" The chemistry between India. Arie and Michael gets the audience on its feet. This is a wonderful tribute to an American musical institution: Motown.",1373673600,,585,5.041237113402062
