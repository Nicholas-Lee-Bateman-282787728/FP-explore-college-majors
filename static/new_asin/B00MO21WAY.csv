6590940,5,B00MO21WAY,"love it, have pre-ordered the next series which will be released this coming january",1413072000,6,84,5.071428571428571
6590941,1,B00MO21WAY,"In the mid 19th century, Matthew Arnold warned his countrymen, in ""Culture and Anarchy"":

"" . . . the use of culture is that it helps us, by means of its spiritual standard of perfection, to regard wealth as but machinery, and not only to say as a matter of words that we regard wealth as but machinery, but really to perceive and feel that it is so. If it were not for this purging effect wrought upon our minds by culture, the whole world, the future as well as the present, would inevitably belong to the Philistines. The people who believe most that our greatness and welfare are proved by our being very rich, and who most give their lives and thoughts to becoming rich, are just the very people whom we call the Philistines. Culture says: 'Consider these people, then, their way of life, their habits, their manners, the very tones of their voice; look at them attentively; observe the literature they read, the things which give them pleasure, the words which come forth out of their mouths, the thoughts which make the furniture of their minds; would any amount of wealth be worth having with the condition that one was to become just like these people by having it?' And thus culture begets a dissatisfaction which is of the highest possible value in stemming the common tide of men's thoughts in a wealthy and industrial community, and which saves the future, as one may hope, from being vulgarised, even if it cannot save the present.""

The Philistines are in fashion again. Adored again. They use the massive machinery of their wealth not for any ""spiritual standard of perfection"" but only for vulgar ends: such as eating. In fancy surroundings of course. Now and then, they breed more eaters to continue the august tradition. Which any bug can do. And some bugs have fancier costumes. Why not instead watch a nature show on insects? Learn more. Alas, our culture rarely ""begets a dissatisfaction"" . . .  Nothing else for looking up from the dining table? For moving on, ahead?

Kenneth Clark: ""I wonder if a single thought that has helped forward the human spirit has ever been conceived or written down in an enormous room.""

Nabokov: ""... generally speaking, philistinism presupposes a certain advanced state of civilization, where, throughout the ages, certain traditions have accumulated in a heap and have started to stink.""

T.S. Eliot: ""Not fare well,
 But fare forward, voyagers.""

But go on: consume.",1412640000,12,2423,4.779904306220096
6590942,5,B00MO21WAY,"I always buy it, and don't think complaining will make it cheaper, always seems to be a great deal by the time it comes out (to us)!!
I do have a question that no one seems to ask.... why do we have to wait so many months in the US to see it? It apparently started in the UK on TV in September, and we have to wait until January.  However, it is a wonderful show and worth the wait, and worth the money!!  Apparently these complainers haven't been to a movie theatre lately.  Now THAT is an expensive rip-off.",1412640000,67,509,4.07
6590943,2,B00MO21WAY,"As much as I really enjoy this series.... I really can't help making an observation about the cost YOU are charging as well as only 3 discs.  Are there 3 episodes on each disc?  4? 5?  As I say, I truly enjoy this series... but you and the producers have this year, price me out of YOUR market.  You just have to spoil it, heh?",1412640000,17,327,3.9846153846153847

6590945,1,B00MO21WAY,"Sorry, I don't HATE it but come on, $50.00 for 1 Blu-ray? 1 BRD counts as a season? Each season is getting and shorter but one Disc does not a season make. I have seen Mini series use 3-5 BRD this is a utterly disgusting to charge any more than $20.

I hope the season is free for prime users.

Obviously, I cannot comment on the season as of yet but my Mum did mention it seemed shorter this year.  Maybe it needs to be on ITV or have one of the US networks take over where they can pay the actors more so we can have an ""American"" length season.
Sad sad day.",1412208000,20,560,3.8947368421052633
6590946,5,B00MO21WAY,"Downton Abbey remains one of the most anticipated shows on both sides of the Atlantic, and with the UK shows already underway, those of us who are lucky enough to watch them know that the tribulations of the Grantham clan are already in full swing

We left season 4 with Carson and Hughes wandering into the ocean, ankles exposed.  It appears that the liberality of the modern age is starting to effect the help!  Soon they will be asking to take off weekends.  What is a weekend?  The Dowager is just as confused about it too.  There are too many plot lines to even recap, with various murders, hidden children, old-fashioned forbidden love; Season 5 continues along the same line.

Each of our well-worn characters seem to find themselves in familiar territory: Mary is advancing on and yet infuriating suitors, Edith is hopeless at trying to hide her love-child, Lord Grantham is still waiting to bet the family fortune to show he is anything but an impotent landlord (I hear dirigibles are a great investment), while the help are falling into similar conundrums as in Season 4:  Mr. Carson remains in a continual strain of retreating from modernity though steps into the wireless age, albeit mostly unwillingly, Bates continues to quietly menace while we wonder if he really is a cold-blooded killer, while Ms. Pattmore and daisy continue their upward ascent (Daisy might even make head cook someday).

Though it often feels like the ground has been covered before, Season 5 is just right for those Downton fans who have grown fond of the characters and get to follow them in their ascent to the modern age.  Though sometimes bordering being too melodramatic, the show is a tried and true companion in the winter months.  Sometimes just getting to see Isis wander through the scene and hear the Dowager utter a one-liner is enough for a fine Sunday evening.  The new season, so far, does not disappoint; a must for Downton fans.",1412035200,359,1932,4.786144578313253

6591000,5,B00MO21WAY,"The discs come in plastic snap cases. The discs play fine. The first five seasons had swinging plastic pages to hold the discs. The sixth season stacked all of the discs on a single plastic peg.

Downton Abbey captivated me for several seasons. It was different, unlike any other series I was watching. I enjoyed the entire series and plan on rewatching the show. The locations and scenery and likable characters were great. It's not without its flaws. For instance, in the fourth season I was wondering what Thomas' job was. All he does is stand around, spying on people. Is he the spymaster? In season five I found some of the situations and characters tedious and boring. But overall I liked the series very much.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969), Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001), and The Tudors (2007-2010). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2143,5.445783132530121

6591087,1,B00MO21WAY,"This is fast food compared to most other english period shows. For grown up stuff there's Jewel in the Crown(80s), Brideshead Revisited(80s) and what this is a cheap ripoff of in many ways Upstairs, Downstairs(70s). The phenomenolism and novelty moments cut together into a big feel good and feel bad moment fest is gruesome. I stopped watching this show after season 2, it just goes off a cliff into even more cheesiness from there. The plot is about a bunch of pharisees(phariseo-masons) trying to get money from an entailment, huh never have that in almost ALL english novels since at least Dickens. ALL about some inheritance or some such deus ex machina inheritance in the form of money. It's just so crass and materialistic wrapped up in a sugary coating for the dullards who love it. It also gives us all another helping of BS British history, great nonsense for the yanks to lap up and they do. The dog will eat it's own vomit if it gets lowly enough. Terrible.

It's packed with cringe worthy moments and awkward wooden acting in so many places I wouldn't know where to start. The BS British history pushed down our throats is terrible. Why does America have ""special"" allies who are its bitterest enemies throughout history like 1. Britain 2. Israel 3. Saudi Arabia. And why do dunderheads love those countries in such a treasonous fashion? Rhodes Scholars pack the elite in America and these are programmed multiples in service of the British Empire, which exists in a covert way, mostly financial but also spiritual. Anglophiles like the Rockefellers and others who are the biggest enemies to an independent America, not to mention Carnegie and Ford, both British-Israel acolytes. The CFR is controlled by the Round Table/Chatham House and the Federal Reserve is owned covertly by City of London masonic entities with its frontmen like the Rockefellers, Duponts, Russells etc In short this is British-Israel empire propaganda ""history"" writ large. On a deeper level it's a kabbalistic deified mankind judaeo-masonic occult piece. Witness the very logo which is a mirror of the Adam Kadmon of the Kabbalah if you look it up. The mirror image of the ""sacred"" house built on piracy and usury. The upper ""good"" for show part and the lower ""evil"" real part. Specifically the Kabbalistic belief of balance, that one must balance good and evil acts. In other words they believe to do evil is to ""help"" the good along and vice versa. This makes no sense and is satanic. For instance if one uses pyramidal banking like loaning out nine times more than what one actually has and charges interest for it out of nothing and then enslaves people to debt. That's the bad part, well the ""good"" part is putting your name or money into a TAX FREE trust which gives money to hospitals and the arts. The reality is that this charity is just a control mechanism to regulate medical care and creative expression that is ""approved"" by these evil internationalist central bankers, oil companies, insurance companies etc etc. These are controlled in the totally masonic City of London and Switzerland. I could go on but the point is that this is a terrible series that is only fake history and propaganda and dramatically is just so dumbed down it's insulting.",1502928000,,3248,4.841726618705036

It has become one of my favorite series of all time and after 60 years of TV and movie viewing that should say a lot.  From the marvelous character development to the gorgeous scenery and splendor of that era, each character has become so real and special to me. and Dame Maggie Smith is an absolute joy as the Dowager.  Her wit, sarcasm and wisdom in this part is unsurpassed and any and all accolades she has received are so very very well deserved.  That is not to take away from any of the other actors involved as it seems each and every one of them has taken me back 100 years and made me feel as though I'm a part of the family.  From laughter to tears and all the emotions in between, this series will forever stay in my mind as an outstanding example of writing, directing, acting, cinematography and editing.  No one should be disappointed watching this series in its entirety.",1487635200,,1021,4.427807486631016

6591289,5,B00MO21WAY,"I've watched the entire series.  I was riveted throughout.  What a wonderful peek into the lives of the wealthy in England at the turn of the century and before.  The sets and the costumes were brilliant and the story interesting.  I was pleased with the concern that the family of owners showed for the servants as well as the respect and concern the servants showed for their employers.  There was a constant parallel of trials and tribulations endured by both the family members and the service members which showed that, apart from the wealth, their lives were very similar.  One thing puzzled me throughout.  No one ever seemed to knock on someone's door to enter a room, they just walked in.  I would think that, with all their formalities and protocols, to barge into someone's private room would be considered rude.
I avoided Downton Abbey for a long time, thinking that it was not ""my cup of tea"", but after watching just the first episode, I was hooked.
I'll miss my routine of watching a couple of episodes just before bed each night.",1486684800,,1045,4.672131147540983

6591782,5,B00MO21WAY,"This was perhaps my favorite season, because so many outlandish mini-story arcs got introduced and then discarded like the issue of ""Lady's Sketch"" that Cora, the simpering Countess of Grantham, is shown reading in the very first episode. I will provide no spoilers and encourage any of you reading this to discover the wonders of Julian Fellowes's knack for delivering the implausible for yourselves. I will say this, though: I wish the series had gone on for a few more years. It ended just before the General Strike of 1926 and it would have been fun to see how Downton put up with that, and then the Depression, and then World War II, and the total post-war collapse of that whole way of life. If ""Downton"" bore any semblance to reality surely some of the characters would have been dead by, say, 1965, but given that the series started in 1912 and ended in 1925 or 1926 and no one seemed to have aged a day I'm sure they all could have lived on and been embroiled in the Profumo affair and maybe roll out the old Victrola to listen to a Beatles record.

Wonderful Maggie Smith steals the show, however, the entire cast is great. Downton Abbey brings to life a historical period that demonstrates the parallel lives of royalty and their servants.

6592404,4,B00MO21WAY,"Season 5 of DA continued along the series' merry way.  Lady Mary playing both nice girl/b*****, the Earl basically clueless, Thomas the footman/underbutler still a nasty piece of work but people still trust him (?), and Bates and Anna always one foot in the dark dungeon of law -- just a bit contrived. I'm a middling fan of Downton Abbey -- not because it's not good, but basically I've seen it all before. Not a single plot device not seen in the original Upstairs Downstairs. That's not to take anything away from the writing or the acting. It is well worth sitting through any number of plot-retreads for the scenes between Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton (Harriet Jones in Dr. Who -- ""yes, we know who you are"").  It does become clear during this series that the ""family"" still wields considerable power over others ""below"" them, regardless of morals, ethics, or feelings. Will they ever get their comeuppance or be made to atone?  Probably not.",1484092800,,951,4.751515151515152

6592435,5,B00MO21WAY,"Beautifully crafted story with characters you love to watch. My wife and I, enjoyed the break from the usual subject matter of TV dramas, and were carried away to another world. An era unfamiliar in its detail brought to life with captivating visuals as well harsh realities of economic excesses of the well placed in society to those working to survive amongst them. Time and historical events produce changes to society and economies resulting in shifts in the fabric of people's attitudes towards established beliefs. Change is not the culprit here but how you adapt to it and move forward. The characters on each side of the economic and societal scale are brought together so as to say goodbye to the past and look to the future as their only viable alternative for survival.",1484006400,,780,4.8283582089552235

I learned a great deal from it also and how the different classes truly lived in those times. Maggie Smith had me hysterical, though there were times through the different characters you just couldn't help but cry. I'm actually happy that I didn't watch it on PBS. Watching it on Amazon like it was 1 long movie, was great for me. I think it took me 4-5 days to go through the entire 6 seasons. I couldn't keep myself away from it. I'm so glad that my son gave me the fire stick as 1 of my Christmas gifts. It was actually my favorite gift, but I can't let anyone else know!  Maggie Smith had me screaming eith laughter along with a lot of the other characters,  and sometimes circumstances had me crying, especially when the show ended. I almost want to wait awhile and watch the show all over again lol. It's definitely a series worth watching and their English was superb, not a mumble among them!",1483574400,,1019,4.409574468085107

I am enthralled with the performances, and Maggie Smith, in a small supporting role, is better than ever.  That's saying a mouthful since she is one of the best actresses to grace stage or screen.

I've heard it rumored and would be delighted to see all of the characters grow and expand their stories through the roaring 20's and beyond. Of course there would babies and the Matriarch Lady Granthom would eventually die but the American stock market would crash and the Depression would happen in America.

6593032,5,B00MO21WAY,"Downton Abbey is one of my favorite series of all times.  It shows the best and worst of the British ruling class and how dependent everyone in the household was on their assumed kindness, generosity and continuing sense of responsiblity.  The issues that drive the plot of each episode are as believable and pertinent today as they were during the WWII era of this show.  Everything about Downton Abbey, the actors, actresses and the magic they weave is ""top drawer"" and leaves the viewer with a greater understanding of the human condition and a lingering melancholy for times past when everything was clearer somehow....",1481932800,,623,4.971153846153846

6593052,5,B00MO21WAY,Every Season of Downton Abbey was excellent. It felt like I knew every character personally. I watched season one to the final season in about a week each season having 6 to 9 episodes. I really didn't know what it was about. Seeing the era of time they lived in definitely didn't motivate me to watch it. But I decided to just look at an episode because I had heard bits and pieces here and there that it was good.  One episode I was hooked! If you're new to Downton Abby please watch the preview of the making of the show. It's fascinating. When I was watching the final season my husband who likes to slip upstairs after dinner and watch sports was still sitting downstairs. So I say baby you can go up. He's no I'm watching this. Then he watches another episode and wants me to go all the way back to season one so he can watch the whole series.,1481846400,,849,4.208588957055214

6593216,5,B00MO21WAY,"I  love Downton Abbey. I think it is at the very top of the heap. It is one of the best casts I can remember. The Brit aristocracy, to my recollections, has been vilified by so many writers, as if there were none of merit. I have regard for tradition when it serves a useful purpose, but I was never in the position of being pressured to maintain it because I was the successor. It brings to light the ambivalence of the peers in trying to keep what was entrusted to them while accommodating the political, social and financial upheaval going on around them. This resonates in the USA today as we grapple with the problems of refugees, national debt, countering the enemies we've made by our inept foreign policy and providing health insurance, educational opportunities and decent living conditions to our citizenry.",1481241600,,817,4.713286713286713

Sell Downton Farm hams and sausages and Downton Kitchen jams and soups with a picture of Mrs. Patmore holding a wooden spoon on the label. Turn the village into a tourist destination with a farmers market every weekend. Hold weekly tournaments on the cricket pitch for teams from the area. Set up the war widows with Downton Farms sandwich booths at all the village events and at the train station too. Keep a few core blocks of shops in the main district from modernizing - gas light, no electricity, - and as time passes begin to advertise it as a historical village where time has stood still.  Tuppence to park your car. I'd have them solvent in no time.",1481155200,,754,4.463768115942029

6593930,5,B00MO21WAY,"Not much great TV used to end perfectly but recently TV producers, directors and writers seem to have been paying more attention to how they wrap up their masterpieces.

Downton Abbey is a masterpiece and I cannot think of a better way of wrapping it up (except with a few more seasons) than Season 5.

Really brilliant stuff at the very highest end of what TV has ever had to offer.

I give my very highest recommendation to Season 5 and to all the preceding Seasons.

I must add that the video and audio quality of each and every Season of Downton Abbey on Amazon Prime is of the absolute highest quality.  I very seldom use my Blu Ray player these days because Amazon Prime streaming video is at least the same quality and you don't have to worry about dropping a disc or otherwise making it unplayable.

Downton Abbey is one of the high points of TV in the entire history of the genre!",1477094400,,889,4.357575757575757

The characters are great, and so easy to love or hate, or love to hate haha. I really like that this does not drag things out like so many other shows see to do. I love the time it is set in, it is so fun to see, it's like traveling back in time! I get so involved and in the characters, and I was so saddened when some of them have died. It is fascinating to see how people lived back then, I'm England too. The upper class are so proper and some are so snooty. But some are so kind and sweet. I think Matthew was my favorite male character and Mary is my favorite female character. Lord Grantham has his good attributes as well, he's easy to love too. Cora has such a good heart, such a sweety. I'll be sad when this show ends.",1476576000,,856,3.8971428571428572

The subtle humor was a warm welcomed change proof you need not curse to be funny. We were able to watch this as a family.  The set and costumes were amazing. Sad it's over and would welcome a season 7. We need more TV like this! Thank you PBS. Thank you Amazon-,1476576000,,384,4.162162162162162

We were fortunate to attend the season premiere attended by none other than the amazing actress Phylllis Logan, aka Ms. Hughes, in Richmond, VA.  The crowds reaction when her husband, actor Kevin McNally, who played Horace Bryant, introduced our beloved Ms. Hughes was jaw dropping.  Although we drove a short 50 miles to the venue for the experience, my wife & I both agreed we would have driven 5,000 miles for the moment.  In my small families opinion, there can never be such a rich & well done series which will be measured by the originality, creativity and beauty.

6594798,5,B00MO21WAY,"Loved all of the seasons of Downton Abbey--which I binge watched on Amazon Prime this month!  The final season really does bring the whole series to a meaningful conclusion, with moments that extend the memory of Sybill, and examine the desperate complexity of characters, such as Thomas Barrows.  Having started with this season by mistake, then watching the other five seasons in a couple of weeks, I found that I wanted to watch the last season again, and love the full range of history and emotion that I experienced with these characters, as the world changes, and their humanity is increasingly revealed.  When this series first came out, I was too busy to watch it and wondered what all the fuss was about; now I am as much of an ardent fan as all the rest!  The entertainment life of any audience member is truly enriched by this extremely well produced, acted, and written series.",1474329600,,889,4.716129032258064

This bureaucratic family and their servants captivates with loyalty, secrecy, love, loss, war, murder and wonderful snide remarks by the dowager duchess. As the seasons roll on, each character comes to the forefront. The villains keep popping up their ugly heads to put a wrench in someone's happiness. If you start watching, you won't stop!

6595810,5,B00MO21WAY,"The fifth season of Up and Downton Abbey proceeds quickly enough. I call this series The House of Many Changes. There are many story arcs here, some long, series long, some season long, and some that rise and fall within a show or two.

The costumes and sets, including period cars, must have cost a fortune. We've been watching the Manor House six shows that is a reality show based on 21st C people living an early 1900 life of Edwardian England. The costumes on The Manor House may be authentic, but frumpy compared to those depicted on Down Abbey. The fashions are gorgeous and give an idea of the style of the time.

I consider this period to be the height of modern history. Everything was changing. The Russian Revolution, the Irish uprising, cubist painting, atonal music, poetry, the arts in general, politics in general. The show emphasizes the changes from the 19th C before WWI to after. I would have loved to been alive then and witnessed it, were I to be well enough to do to appreciate it all.

There are threats to the Crawley family keeping their estate together. Others fail. The series will end in 1925 and I cannot help but wonder how the family could survive 1929? That would make for an interesting addition to the show. At this point, PBS has cancelled season 7.

We were sad to see the final show of season 6. Here at the end of season 5, we have a wonderful English Christmas. What could be better than that?",1470700800,,1433,4.478927203065134

Downton Abbey had great characters who made you want to know what happened to each and every one each week and each new season.  I feel sad that it came to an end because it was so well written and performed.  Could not stand to miss it.

6595850,5,B00MO21WAY,"Outstanding program.  Great character development.  Love the show, but must admit, I find myself laughing at the absurdity of it all.  Women getting bent out of shape if their ""lady's maid"" is not available.  Everything in their lives is scripted-  changing to formal  ""dinner"" clothes every night, , tea only in the library at tea time, needing butlers standing around in the dining room in case they need something.  These people don't do ANYTHING for themselves.  Their children spend much of the time with nannies and only see their parents for a short time each day.  The snobbery is disturbing and very overt.  Jealousy reigns.  God forbid if one relative marries to a more titled  man than another!  My favorite character was Tom-  the chauffeur who married the Earl's daughter.  He is a very down to earth guy who is now part of the family, but still is able to maintain much of his ""true self"".  Interestingly, he's an admitted Socialist-  the antithesis of the the family into which he married.  The cast is stellar, whether their character is nice or mean.  You really believe them to be who they play.  The characters are really brought to life.  Don't miss this series!",1470700800,,1182,4.752475247524752

6596356,4,B00MO21WAY,"Great show, if only somewhat predictable. A tiny bit overly reliant on dramatic and disastrous extremes and intrigue, with strange and difficult to believe resolutions. Not quite soap opera, but sometimes dangerously close in the story lines. I know it's just a show, but the same scenarios could be more effectively and believably played out. Like dishonest, backstabbing, felony committing help regaining favor on a whim multiple times. Unconventional death, unlikely to occur even once in a families life, in multiples. Overall well done and the acting is the true strength. Minus a couple weak performances.",1469232000,,611,5.375

6596376,5,B00MO21WAY,"Really a great show!  I was skeptical and my husband moreso but I decided to give it a try while he was at work.  He came home while I was watching episode 3 of season 1 and after 15-20 minutes he asked if I would mind starting over again with episode 1 so he could watch it too.  We were both immediately hooked and had a marathon week-long binge of it every chance we got.  Super quality TV, fairly family friendly, addressed some major social issues of the period.  In fact, the show was all about addressing social issues but cleverly done in a way that highlighted the perspectives of both sides on every topic and didn't really vilify either.  Some of the strongest proponents for both sides were also some of the most lovable characters which, imo, makes the writing very impartial.  We were really bummed to see it end and still have conversations about the show and the characters a week later.  Very thought provoking indeed.",1469232000,,935,4.523809523809524
6596377,5,B00MO21WAY,"TV these days has revolved largely around cop shows (clever how they solve cases but so violent), sitcoms I just can't get interested in, and talent-search.  I don't watch much of it.

It is so refreshing to have this delightful show on PBS.  And it is so interesting to see what life was like 90-100 years ago.  The show is very well-written, the costumes are amazing.  I highly recommend Downton Abbey.",1469232000,,404,4.633802816901408

It is a pleasure to watch but, at its core, it is basically a soap opera.  The actors are so wonderful that it makes it less obvious that there is very little in the way of real character development.  For instance, characters are suddenly ""in love"", but you don't really feel anything about how they got there.  But many of the performers manage to convey more depth than the scripts provide.",1468713600,,480,4.734939759036145

I'm not a royalist, I even think the whole King/Nobles/Peasants thing is due to die a quiet and natural death, but still I am a Kate & William fan. I am particularly attracted to the Royal Navy as portrayed in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin books. Anyway, Downton Abbey is by far the best TV production of the type that I've ever watched. Upstairs/Downstairs left me disinterested; Monty Python, for the most part, left me confused ""the larch"" what?; but I enjoyed Benny Hill.
