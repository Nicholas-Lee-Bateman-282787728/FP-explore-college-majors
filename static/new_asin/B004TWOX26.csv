8441014,5,B004TWOX26,"Vladimir Jurowski and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment grab you by the throat with the opening chord of the Coriolan Overture and don't let go until you've been sent through the roof by the Seventh Symphony's blazing Finale an hour and 20 minutes later.

What a wild ride.

This represents the finest of 21st century audio and video technology placed at the service of early 19th century music to reveal that music at its complete best. And musically, it's all done by the book, as Jurowski and these wonderful musicians follow the letter of Beethoven's scores in order to make their spirit manifest. I'd complain about the Blu-ray's relatively short running time, except I don't think I could take anymore at once. How this music must have rocked its first audiences. It would have been like Jimi Hendrix landing on stage in the middle of a Pete Seeger concert. No wonder composer Carl Maria von Weber declared Beethoven fit for the madhouse after hearing the Seventh Symphony.

Hogwood, Norrington, and Gardiner shook the world of classical music back in the 1980s with their ""innovative"" use of the instruments of Beethoven's time to perform the symphonies, also demonstrating in the process that Beethoven's carefully specified tempos -- which had been ignored and geared down by conductors presiding over huge, lumbering, early 20th century orchestras -- were not the product of a deranged mind but the marks of a revolutionary genius. Not that the whole period-instrument bunch produced good results. Some of them ... well, some of them were pretty bad, proving that old instruments alone did not a Beethoven symphony make. But when they struck fire, they could be wonderful. Listening for the first time to Hogwood's recording of the Seventh, with Anthony Halstead and his natural horn section blasting away in the Finale, I headed for the nearest university music library to look at a copy of the score. I'd never heard such raucous sounds in the cushy recordings of modern orchestras. Surely, I thought, this must be some kind of aberration. But lo, there those sounds were, plain as day, written right on the page. And wow, do they raise the hair on the back of your neck.

As they do in Jurowski's 2010 performance, held in the Thtre des Champs-Elyses (where the premiere of another revolutionary work, Stravinsky's ""Le Sacre du printemps,"" took place in 1913). It's not just about using period instruments or adhering to Beethoven's tempos or splitting the first and second violins left and right or restoring the original balance between winds and strings. It's all of those elements combined plus the requisite lan of execution, which is all the more obvious from being able to watch these remarkable musicians as they play -- whether it's Lisa Beznosiuk on flute or Antony Pay on clarinet or Andrew Clark heading up the section on those natural horns whose sound permeates the orchestra, from mellow to invigorating to mind-blowing, or Adrian Bending slamming the timpani so hard you think the taut heads will break or Matthew Truscott leading the strings, performing on gut rather than steel and using the shorter, faster bows that put Beethoven's tempos within reach. Jurowski is no period-instruments ""specialist."" He simply knows how to use them to produce results.

Take the Seventh Symphony for a closer examination. Some people will think Jurowski's tempo for the second movement too fast, but the second movement is not an Adagio or even an Andante. It's marked Allegretto and, as Jurowski & Company demonstrate, powerfully effective when taken at Beethoven's slightly brisker pace. One reviewer says he is surprised at the ""steady"" tempo maintained in the final movement, which is designated Allegro con brio. But Presto, as the third movement is marked, is faster than Allegro (the ""con brio"" that follows the Allegro title indicates only the manner in which it is to be played, not its basic pulse). Thus, the Presto third movement is clearly intended to move more quickly than the Allegro finale, which methodically builds and builds and builds to an overwhelming conclusion. As is often done in less disciplined performances, letting loose of the tempo in an abandoned, accelerating rush reduces the cumulative effect, and Jurowski holds onto the reins just tightly enough to ensure the desired result.

It's breathtaking, as I believe it was meant to be.

8441015,5,B004TWOX26,"Briefly:
About the BD: The sound and image are great. Period. Although, usually, I pay less attention to image, for I prefer to, in my 1st listening, only listen without image; I do not want to get distracted by image while diving into the music itself.
About the music: This is indeed one of the best performances of Beethoven music. For instance, Jurowski and OAE were able to bring out the Dionysian and the Apollonian aspects of Beethoven's 7th in all their clarity. The 2nd mov. is full of Apollonian grace and control (but almost hypnotic), while the fiery 4th mov. intoxicate us with overwhelming excitement that you will desire to become one with this music. What I love about Historic Informed Performances is the so well balanced sonority between strings and wind/brass while percussion is clearly heard as well. Such is what you get in this recording/performance. I just mentioned two little examples about the 7th, but the 4th and Coriolan are just masterly performed as well. There is no way to go wrong with this BD.",1421625600,,1030,4.792134831460674

8441017,5,B004TWOX26,"There are of course numerous authoritative readings of the pieces recorded in this DVD.
The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, however, is a period instrumental ensemble.  There are some people who adamantly refuses to accept any 'period' performance of Beethoven's grand symphonies.
I approachded this disc with reservation myself, but the performance as recorded quickly dispelled any of my remaining concern.
The recorded sound is very good.  I first played the disc without viewing, and was rapturous of the accoustics, and much more so as I listened further by the performance.
Jurowski has a good credential as an opera conductor.  He is in charge currently of the Glyndebourne Festival, and has conducted at Italy, Germany, USA, and at large opera houses, even the MET, all to critical acclaim.
Perhaps it is time to acknowledge that this musician's strength lies not only in opera.  The wonderful pianist Sviastoslav Richter began his pianistic career doing piano rehearsals for opera houses.  Nobody termed the legendary Richter an 'opera pianist'.  What is in the operas, often goes into a composer's instrumental music, W A Mozart is a clear example to boot.
The conducting of Jurowski is clearly dramatic, but at the same time totally idiomatic. You will not find a Beethoven that is like Wagner. Having watched him live, Vladimir is clearly one of those 'conducting before the music' conductors.
For young conducting talents, the No. 7 Symphony here reminds me of Guido Cantelli's own stereo recording of this masterpiece, a performance that is totally youthful and energised.  Jurowski and the OAE comes really close to that legendary reading.",1347148800,2,1661,5.2218045112781954
8441018,5,B004TWOX26,"This is a sharply etched set of Beethoven works as played by an orchestra using instruments typical of Beethoven's period under the firm and disciplined direction of the young Russian conductor Vladimir Jurowski.

Many will associate Jurowski with successful performances of opera where there is generally a strong dramatic impulse to the interpretations, frequently up-tempo choices of speeds and generally tight control. This often leads to exciting results within the theatre world. Expectations of a similarly dramatic view of Beethoven are therefore raised.

On this disc the music is presented along those expected lines. The concert starts with a grippingly taut performance of the Coriolan Overture. This is followed by an equally tight and dramatic account of the 4th symphony with sharp articulation from the orchestra at generally crisp speeds. Drama is accentuated by prominent timpani with hard sticks and cuttingly forceful brass. This is not a comfortable concept, but Beethoven himself was not a comfortable character either.

The concert concludes with a strikingly dramatic performance of the popular 7th symphony that follows all the previous characteristics with the exception of the speed chosen for the last movement. This `apotheosis of the dance' is taken at a relatively steady speed which initially comes as rather a surprise in the context of all that had gone before. However, as the movement continues, it becomes clear that the chosen speed, which is adhered to with remarkable consistency, is exactly right in enabling the vital concluding bars with blaring horns to truly hit home with precise articulation and power - the overwhelming effect that Beethoven surely had in mind at the time of writing.

This therefore, is a very fine and convincing disc of `period' Beethoven performances. Taken on its own terms it is probably unlikely to be bettered in terms of drama, accuracy of performance and period style.

The recording is exceptionally fine in so far as the sound fully captures the energetic `rawness' of the intended sound. This is backed up by dramatically sympathetic camera work that manages to be detailed without being invasive.

This disc can therefore be recommended for serious consideration for all collectors who like their Beethoven to be dramatic and powerful",1342051200,,2313,5.34065934065934

Vladimir Jurowski, conductor
Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment
Theatre des Champs-Elysees
EuroArts Blu-ray Disc

In my opinion, this disc illustrates once again why Maestro Jurowski is earning a reputation as one of the premier orchestra and opera conductors of today. The three Beethoven works performed here are examples of classical music-making at its very best, with tempos and dynamic shadings that are spot on.  In addition, the use of period instruments and a small-scaled orchestra afford listeners a clarity of detail, textures, colors, and harmonies that are remarkable.

Noteworthy also are those occasional passages featuring the tympani and/or horns.  In such instances these accent instruments are heard to distinct advantage; and, with impressive results.

Finally, it should be noted that the playing of the major theme of the 7th symphony's final movement is striking.  In my opinion this is due to the style of bowing employed by the violins that's known as (I think) ""spiccato.""  Spiccato is a bowing technique that gives the music more ""bite"" and definition than the legato bowing customarily heard in performances of this work. Hearing the theme played this way has convinced this music lover that it is exactly the way it should be played and heard.

Both the picture and sound quality of this Blu-ray disc are excellent.",1313280000,5,1399,5.242152466367713
8441020,3,B004TWOX26,"Where to begin? My friend Gerhard Knapp loves this disc (see his review).Usually we see eye to eye. In this case, I'm afraid we'll have to agree to disagree! I've listened to it several times, but I can't warm to it.

Let me say that my own preference for Beethoven is big-band sumptuous sound. I like the Thielemann/Vienna Phil. set. I'm not fond of the scratchy, honky sounds that emanate from these ""original instruments"". Sir Thomas Beecham once famously pronounced that they sounded like cats copulating on a tin roof. I wouldn't go that far, but I do think you have to play the music swiftly if you're going to minimize the unprettiness of these old instruments. Jurowski plays these symphonies way too slowly, especially the fast movements, so you get a lot of unusual, and for me, unwelcome noises coming through.

It is often said that this is how Beethoven heard his music. First of all, his deafness prevented him hearing much of anything, but I'm convinced that had he been able to appreciate today's much improved instruments and more skillful players, he would have much preferred this later sound.

If you like your Beethoven small, quick and lean, try to hear the Paavo Jarvi set with his Bremen orchestra on Sony DVD.His attack and phrasing are something to behold. Sadly not available from Amazon in the U.S.A,you can get it from ""import cds"" in California, amongst other sources. These are as exciting as any you'll ever hear, and contain the ""wickedest"" Beethoven #7 I've ever heard! Even a large orchestra guy like me can love this set!

So this Jurowski for me was disappointing, but others may like it better. My advice is get the Jarvi set. It really is remarkable.",1312848000,3,1689,4.7542662116040955
8441021,5,B004TWOX26,"From the very first bars of the Coriolan Overture, it is apparent that this is Beethoven at his very best. Vladimir Jurowski and his absolutely brilliant Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment give us a new reading of old favorites that may well blow you out of your chair. There is plenty to discover: sounds and textures never heard before, an orchestral timbre as the composer himself may have envisaged and heard, incredible strength and cohesion and, on the other hand, sensitive nuances that often disappear under a blanket of massed strings in more traditional interpretations. Listen to the period woodwinds, the valveless trumpets and horns, the timpani actually striking the music's beat! Enough. As the interpretations go, all three are glorious and fully in tune with the respective works. In the symphonies, Jurowski lovingly takes his time with the first two movements to press on rather relentlessly in the final movements. Believe me: it works. Sound and video of the 2010 recording are great and the Paris audience in the beautiful Thatre des Champs-Elyses is rightly bowled over. Do not miss this disk.",1308009600,4,1119,5.086956521739131
