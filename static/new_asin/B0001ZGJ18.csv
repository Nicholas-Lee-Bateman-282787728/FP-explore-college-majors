8018796,4,B0001ZGJ18,"I bought this DVD after my VHS copy was eaten by my player.

This appears to be a transfer of the original MPL video. As another reviewer noted, the picture and sound are acceptable, but if you're

expecting excellent DVD-style video and audio, you're not going to find it.  I'm hoping that MPL will re-release this in such a DVD format in the near future.

The content is great and a must have for any Beatles/McCartney fan.  There's footage of studio rehearsals in anticipation of the tour that followed and some fun interviews with Paul as well as some interesting commentary by Elvis Costello who co-wrote ""My Brave Face"" with McCartney and comments by both on how they co-wrote the song.",1169078400,,692,4.68595041322314

8018799,5,B0001ZGJ18,"A great document of the 1989 tour that supported the fine ""Flowers in the Dirt"" album. Complete with interviews, concert footage and rehearsals. A must for every Macca fan!",1094947200,6,172,4.9655172413793105
