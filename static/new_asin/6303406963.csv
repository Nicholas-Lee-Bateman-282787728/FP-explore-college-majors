642357,5,6303406963,"An exceptionally tense, minimalist film that truly exudes the whole Cold War era angst and mystery of what lies behind the Iron Curtain.  Though Frankenheimer did not direct this classic, it is reminiscent of The  Manchurian Candidate, but much more chilling in its unsettling view of Big  Brother Communism.",959558400,7,308,5.244897959183674
642358,4,6303406963,"The Naked Runner is not as well-known as it should be.  Frank Sinatra plays an ex-commando who is recruited to rub out a foreign leader.  The people recruit him by abducting his son and giving him the ultimatum  ""Kill our enemy, or else.""  Sinatra is manipulated cleverly and  battles against his own sense of right and wrong and the desire to get his  son back alive.  The film is entertaining from start to finish.",954979200,9,416,4.54054054054054

I called tonight to register my desire that Warner Brothers or their licencee create Video Discs of this classic thriller from cold war days. It is color and Frank Sinatra is a big man. It has a terrific twist at the end! Amazon, please make it available on disc!",1480982400,2,307,4.220338983050848

7846379,5,6303406963,"Sinatra's Best! Frank (Sam Laker) is a salesman of sorts and a former ""special forces"" soldier or sniper during WWII. A british intelligence agent (Mr. Slattery, one of Laker's former commanders during WWII) uses any means necessary to get Frank to assassinate someone... Slattery asks Laker to deliver a secret message hidden inside a watch to a watch repair shop in Leipzig without telling him that his former girl friend (Karen) will be at the receiving end. There's a lot of mystery and suspense as Laker makes he way to Leipzig, Germany on a business trip with his young boy (around 10 I'd say) and secret messasge in hand. When Laker makes the delivery to his old steady he is taken back and can barely control his emotions. After Laker makes the delivery he returns to his hotel and learns that his son has been kidnapped. Laker is then kidnapped by the same people who kidnapped his son. The kidnappers use this leverage to persaude Laker.

The supporting cast is superb! Derrin Nesbitt is very convincing as a former Nazi Colonel and one of his henchmen is sinister and hilarious at the same time. All around The Naked Runner is definately worth a watch!

The soundtrack is amazing! Here's a sample I found... [...]",1380499200,5,1224,4.714953271028038
7846380,5,6303406963,"I can't understand as to the reason this film has not been made into a DVD.
It has been made by Warner Bros.but is a typical British thriller. The story is excellent,the editing is tight and the acting with Frank Sinatra and several leading
British actors is very good indeed. The direction too is excellent.
VHS tapes don't last long in tropical humid climates so I had  it converted to a DVD disc in order to preserve it in my collection. This can be watched over and over again.

7846381,4,6303406963,"This little know film of Mr. Sinatra has been seriously overlooked as a good spy/cold war thriller...It is not the masterpiece of a ""Manchurian Candidate"", but it is a very intriguing film nonetheless...I appreciate the cinematography and different angle of camera shots used in this film...I enjoyed it very much and Sinatra is brilliant in this role...Amy",1246665600,7,357,5.280701754385965
7846382,3,6303406963,"I can't understand why this film has been overlooked for so long. You've got Sidney J. Furie directing Sinatra and a solid supporting  cast with a good storyline. Playing somewhat out of character as a fallguy trying to discover what's going on, Sinatra does an extremely credible job of portraying Sam Laker. Peter Vaughan, playing the ""instigator"" Slattery, is so good that I wanted to do away with him myself. It was great to see Nadia Gray again in a small but effective role. The only complaint is that it seems as though the entire film was dubbed in afterwards. There's a great and very satisfying finale that gives you reason to project what might happen next. This film deserves to be seen and I highly recommend it.",1076803200,7,725,4.6640625
7846383,1,6303406963,"This is a truly bad flick. Even the marketing catch phrase is nonsensical: ""They found the key to Sam Laker. They wound it up tight. And then they turned him loose."" You don't wind up a key, you use a key to wind something up. Good grief. The casting is also pretty wretched, with second-rate British actors utilizing German accents reminiscent of Hogan's Heroes. The kiddie actor who plays Frank's son is a cross between Danny Bonnaducie and little Anakin from The Phantom Menace. (This is not a compliment)
 The plot errors contained in the two positive reviews indicate how delusional these reviewers are.  The story is convoluted and ridiculous.  Let's see, a commie baddie has escaped from the British and instead of using any of their highly-trained agents to eliminate him they create an elaborate web to manipulate a former sharp-shooter, who has spent the last 20+ years in furniture sales, into doing the job. Yeah...
 Then again, when we consider the pre-September 11th performance of the FBI and CIA, maybe this is how intelligence operations work.
  Anyhow, Sinatra is certainly at his most disinterested. He filmed this movie immediately after his marriage to Mia Farrow, and subsequently walked off the film before it was finished(perhaps to be with his young bride?). Maybe this offscreen problem contributed to the choppiness of the film. In fact, the ""minimalist"" approach which the other reviewers tout was probably due to this constraint.  The frequent use of doubles/stand-ins for Frank's role provides some unintentional hilarity.  While this movie is not as passing-a-kidney-stone painful as a Van Damme or Martin Lawrence flick, do yourself a favor skip it. Instead, check out ""The Manchurian Candidate"" to witness a true cold war classic as well as a performance that demonstrated what kind of an actor Sinatra could be when he actually cared.",1024531200,3,1868,5.0816993464052285
