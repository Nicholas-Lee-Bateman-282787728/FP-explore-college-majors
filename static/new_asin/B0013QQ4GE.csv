There is no real training advise in this video. It is just a super old video of a guy training his dogs with no instructions or tips.
You are better off spending your money on something else.",1500595200,,249,4.434782608695652

8252637,4,B0013QQ4GE,"Great Information in this DVD. I adopted 2 mixed dogs (1 australian shepard/boxer mix and 1 lab/border collie mix) from a local rescue organization. They are EXTREMELY smart, but sometimes, I worry that I'm not challenging their minds enough. I do lots of obedience training, but I was looking to take training to the next level and this DVD was just what I needed. You can tell that the guy in this video has dog training experience, but sometimes having an up-beat personality goes a long way. If you can suffer through the dry talking, you too can take your dog training to the next level.",1439596800,,592,4.59433962264151

8252641,5,B0013QQ4GE,"This DVD will not do the trick by itself, but it is a perfect companion to Spencer's Training Retrievers for Marshes and Meadows book.  It was nice for me to see him in action after reading his book for 6 months.  He is awesome.",1310256000,4,228,4.159090909090909
