4093071,5,B003954IY2,I  purchased this for the Black Swarm movie.  It is about wasps that have been genetically induced to kill for the government in wars.  Everyone of the actors were great.  It brought a father together with his daughter he didn't know about.  I'm sure the other two movies will live up to Black Swan.  I missed them when they were on the SciFi Movie Channel.  Now I get to see them.,1391904000,3,381,4.28169014084507
4093072,5,B003954IY2,"I started collecting this series after I watched one with Gary Busey called ""Maneater"".  Which is an excellent movie, by the way.  Good entertainment.",1378080000,3,150,5.208333333333333
4093073,4,B003954IY2,"Three movies in this pack and my favorite is Swamp Devil.  Movie is far fetched but fun to watch.
Eye of the Beast is about a huge squid - don't see it much in the movie although they talk about it a lot.
Black Swarm is okay.",1376611200,2,225,3.7872340425531914
4093074,4,B003954IY2,"This set was okay, but not my favorite.  Two of the three I rated fair to good, and one mediocre.

Swamp Devil - Mediocre story of a vine plant creature that runs amuck in a swamp and kills people that trespass.  Not much to this one and it didn't keep my interest fully.  A bad case of poison ivy would be more exciting. I don't see much chance I will watch it again.

Eye of the Beast - Good giant squid story that kept my interest the whole movie.  I would definitely be interested in a sequel.  If the F/X had been a little better this would be almost to Jaws and The Beast caliber.  Well worth at least a rental and I'm glad I bought this set for this movie alone.

Black Swarm - Fair story about killer wasps from a military experiment that goes haywire so the wasps have stingers the size of knitting needles.  The acting isn't bad and has Robert Englund as a scientist.  Worth a rental.

8391939,5,B003954IY2,"These are three of the cheesy SyFy movies that show on Saturday afternoons, you know the ones we all love but are afraid to admit it to our friends. Each movie contains the requisite beasts (bugs in Black Swarm), the innocents dying, and the heroes fighting to stop the bloodbath. Each movie is in my humble opinion a 5 star ""B"" movie in it's own rite. I won't go into details about each movie that is for you the viewer to find out. I will however, say that if you like this stuff, you won't be disappointed. These are the movies that Saturday afternoon was made for. So, pop a top, sit back, grab some popcorn and enjoy. I know I did.

8391940,5,B003954IY2,Three pretty good films. Swamp Devil was actually outstanding. Bruce Dern always adds 50% to any film he is in though. Every actor in the film did an excellent job. I really enjoyed this one.,1469577600,,191,4.485714285714286
