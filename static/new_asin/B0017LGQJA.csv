8266432,4,B0017LGQJA,It's not high quality animation.  But it is engaging story-telling.  I get a big kick out of it.,1456876800,,96,4.277777777777778
8266433,4,B0017LGQJA,"We've all heard the saying, ""the book is better."" Silent Mobius has got to be one of the best series I've ever got into and highly recommend it. Though the true story lies within the the two animated movies and the manga. The T.V. series hits the high spots and even deviates the story sometimes but overall its still pretty good!",1445731200,,330,4.426229508196721
8266434,3,B0017LGQJA,"Kia Asamiya's story of the Attack Mystical Police (AMP for short) details the lives of several gifted woman who fight supernatural beings in a future Tokyo. While the team is made up of several talented ladies the main focus is on Katsumi. Silent Mbius was a quite high profile property in the early 1990s and the motion picture which was made during that period had high production values given the era. The movie was a very condensed story and did not really scratch the surface of Silent Mbius' rich world.

I was excited about the Silent Mobius series as there was so much story o be told. Produced  in the early 2000s I did not expect the animation quality or the motion picture but was very disappointed to see the series was very cheaply animated with a low frame rate. There are lots of long scenes panned across backgrounds as characters talk and in some cases reused cels.

The story is good and uses the manga as its bases although the character designs have been changed or altered in some cases. I enjoyed this anime but only as fan of the original source material. I imagine viewers new to Silent Mbius would be turned off by the low production values in the animation.

A great story made mediocre by bad animation and average voice acting.",1374537600,2,1255,4.564444444444445
8266435,2,B0017LGQJA,"Silent Mobius is a story about a team of women that fight monsters. It's like a lame version of Bubblegum Crisis. The things I don't like about this anime are:
1: The animation is bad. It's an older series, but the technology for way bTetter quality existed at the time.
2: The story had a good initial idea, but was not carried out in an interesting manner.
3: The characters. There were several characters with potential, but they weren't developed well enough to make you care about them.
4: Bad voice acting. The characters didn't have any emotions visible in their speech.

Adding all these flaws together I was very disappointed by this series. If you're still curious try watching it on youtube. Definitely don't buy w/o watching first. There are people out there that like this series. This is just my opinion. So you may want to give it a shot. I hope you like it.",1350604800,2,873,4.560509554140127
