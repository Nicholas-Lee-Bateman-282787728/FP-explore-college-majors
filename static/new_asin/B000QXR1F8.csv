Instead it was about how in the late 1970's and early 1980's that South Dakota chancge its usery laws and New York banks took their credit card operations to South Dakota to do business and provide some jobs.

This episode took place in 2004, they talked to folks who used their credit card as an emergency fund but due to job loss and the resulting penalty fees they were unable to pay their bills as they were paying Peter with Paul so they had to go bankrupt.

Ben Stein appears as does Christopher Dodd with impending legilation (which I think eventually passed) and then Elliot Spitzer as New York Attorney General.

There are four people at a table that are interviewed throughout.

A guy by the name of Andrew Kahr is featured, he suggested to banks the idea of 0% interest for a year and only paying 2% of the bill to cause people to pay less and go longer. Discussion of FICO score with the top number being 850.

Talk of penalty interest, changing the cost of the money after it has been loaned and the office of Comtroller of Currency. Insightful, interesting. We are probably all guilty of this behavior. They said seven million bankrupt claims in the previous year. wow.",1349740800,2,1257,4.491228070175438
