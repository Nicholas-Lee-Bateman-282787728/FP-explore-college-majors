765281,5,6304049285,"My children and I thoroughly enjoyed watching this short film. We found ourselves walking around singing/humming the songs. While I wish it were longer, I'm happy that Disney animated the story.",1446681600,,194,5.290322580645161

765283,5,6304049285,"""John Henry"" is one of Rabbit Ears finest classics since ""Pecos Bill"" as it details the adventures of America's greatest African American hero going up against the steam drill. Denzel Washington's narration is energetic and proud as he narrates John Henry's adventures as if he was really there ( which he points out somewhere in the beginning of the story). B.B. King's music is probably the best part since it is jazzy and soulful, which brings life to this story. Barry Jackson's illustrations are colorful and beautiful, especially of the image of John Henry wearing a white t-shirt and blue jeans. This Rabbit Ears classic will certainly be a favorite for both children and adults.  Also, I would strongly recommend you watch the other Rabbit Ears classics such as ""The Fool and the Flying Ship"" my personal favorite, ""Pecos Bill,"" ""Princess Scargo and the Birthday Pumpkin,"" and ""The Emperor and the Nightingale.""",1250035200,,919,5.046052631578948
765284,5,6304049285,"I am a recent convert to ""Rabbit Ears"" videos...none have appeared on DVD to date, so these are buried treasures. Most of the animated folk tales are very well done.  The story of John Henry (the boy who was born with a hammer in his hand) is recited in a folksy manner by Denzel Washington...but the music of B.B. King takes this simple film over the top.  If you find this VHS interesting,  take a look at the ""Emperor and the Nightingale"" - my personal favorite -  or ""How the Leopard Got His Spots"" - all by Rabbit Ears.  I have been showing these childrens'
movies to discriminating adults and all have very positive things to say...about the artwork, the content, and last but not least, the outstanding actors who have lent their voices to this series.",1181779200,,759,4.510948905109489
