That aside, I've seen a number of the discs in the Pure Beauties Collection and this one is by far the most erotic. The camera's eye seems to gently caress the truly beautiful Ms. Kusanagi as she moves and poses. Her attitude is charming and sexy and her movements are generally languid and appealing. She appears to fully understand just how attractive she is and she looks like she's really enjoying showing herself off. This is Japanese soft core--if you want to clearly see her private areas you're out of luck--but Ms. Kusanagi is partially-clothed or nude for most of the film; furthermore,  her nakedness is highly charged and erotic rather than being a simple innocent nudity.",1103414400,3,824,4.722222222222222
7924942,3,B00004W5W2,"For those who have seen Kusangai Jun pictorials, she is aver seductive and has this air about her whcih also makes her seem rather arrogant and unattainable.  This is what I what I expected when I got this DVD.  I was a bit disappointed that she really does not look as good as she does in ther pictorials, and her voice was nothing what I expected.
Personal expectations aside, Jun talks a lot, about herself and what she likes.  I don't speak a lot of Japanese, but I can make out the context of it all.  She does not do anything particularly naughty, this is really a very soft erotica, just a bit of nudity really,and music inthe background.
DVD features are almost non-existant, allowing only scene selection, and some previews of other DVDs.
Kusanagi Jun fans may want to collect this, but it's not very impressive.",989020800,16,821,4.5646258503401365
