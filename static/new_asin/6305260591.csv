1000158,5,6305260591,"This is masterful and precious storytelling about two middle-aged people: a has-been actress and a homeless man whom she's bumped into on the street and mistaken for a movie director. Intrigued, hungry, and lonely, he  assumes this director's identity and they spend the day together, deceiving  each other in the most loving and heroic ways.  This movie must be watched  over and over again, listened to carefully, savored.  The poetic honesty of  the two lovers and the plight of the homeless men in the shelter where the  man lives are all interwoven and depicted so fleetingly, so powerfully,  that you'll want to stop the tape and rewind it in several places just to  get the full impact of the characters and how they influence each other's  destinies.  The scuzzy realism of the homeless shelter is juxtaposed  beautifully with the lyrical speeches of the lovers as they woo each other  with their individual stories about life and disappointment and lost youth.  But, they haven't lost hope, and that's why I adore this film.  If you  want to see a small, beautifully crafted film acted by two world-class  Shakespearean-trained British actors in the lead roles, I guarantee you  won't be disappointed.",952214400,17,1210,4.994974874371859
1000159,5,6305260591,"A good one for those of you looking for an intriguing psychological plot set in a realistic style. Throw in a pinch of the unusual, a generous dose of pathos, a splash of sex, and ride along the edge of this winner.",929491200,8,215,4.142857142857143

I love David Suchet but thought that the part he plays could have been played by almost anybody.
To me this film was very arty farty and really didn't make much sense at all.",1519862400,,206,4.175

7886366,5,6305260591,This movie is so enjoyable that I will watch it more than once!  The acting by Suchet is nothing less than what one would expect of this exceedingly talented man.  I highly recommend this film.,1399420800,,193,4.485714285714286
7886367,3,6305260591,"What attracted me to Sunday was the pairing of David  Suchet (Poirot) & Lisa Harrow (a lady from NZ in  several roles from UK TV to international cinema) in a film as opposed to TV.
Then it was selected by Redford's Festival Sundance. It is serious drama, set in NY,and is gripping viewing.
I will view it a second time as it takes time to absorb. This is a film for those prepared to listen & absorb, rare today as it lacks cops, bombs & the seemingly popular violence on screen. Be brave, tackle it!
Regards

7886368,3,6305260591,"I find it interesting this film did so well at Sundance.  Because of that fact, and because of who was in it, I just expected more.  Had I seen this movie first, I would never have ordered it.  I didn't realize this was from an American film maker.  I ordered this film because of David Suchet and Lisa Harrow.  I have seen them both in BBC productions and am a great fan.  Most of my DVD collection is indeed from the BBC, and my expectations were erroneously along those lines.

The film itself was unique.  It was well acted.  For myself, however, I would rather have just rented it and seen it once.  It is definitely not something I will watch again, or at least not often.  I don't mean to say I hated this film, I did not.  I am not sorry I saw it, but I am sorry I bought it.  If I had a way of selling mine back, I would do so immediately.

The opening scene was full of profanity and characters in situations that looked like they were more from my husband's god-awful movie collection than my own.  Additionally, I found the special feature very boring and poorly done.

With the language and the nudity, I do not know why this movie carried an ""unrated"" rating and not an ""R"".  I'm not a prude by any means, but I at least like the information so I can make a choice about what I watch.  It's my own fault for not researching it more.  If any of you are not sure... be advised.",1293753600,,1389,4.134831460674158
7886369,4,6305260591,"The premier extra on this DVD is the interview that the film's director, Jonathan Nossiter, conducts with one of the great American directors, Arthur Penn, called ""Searching for Arthur"". Nossiter himself is a strange combination of self-conscious and intellectually smug, but when Penn is allowed to speak, it's fascinating.

The film itself, Sunday, in spite of the director's personality that oozes through during the interview with Penn, is actually very good. David Suchet plays Oliver, a middle class IBM manager who's been thrown out of his job, now living in a shelter. By chance, he meets Madeleine, a British actress living in New York, whose marriage is crumbling and who appears to be having a hard time finding work. The two of them connect by a mutual understanding of their sorrowful plights using the clever mechanism of telling each other ""made up"" stories that reflect their real thoughts and feelings about each other. This is compounded by Madeleine's initially mistaking Oliver for a film director, Matthew Delacorta, and then continuing through with this charade, even though she knows it's not true.

One of the plot devices that gives this film a tremendous boost is the intercutting between scenes of Oliver and Madeleine together with scenese depicting life in the homeless shelter where Oliver has come to stay. The men in the shelter--one of whom is played by an actual homeless man, Jimmy Broadway, with a great theatrical presence--are by turns vindictive, lost, petty, and hopeful. Jared Harris in particular is excellent as Ray, one of the homeless men.

Nossiter does not let the viewer off easy with a stereotypical development of the relationship between Oliver and Madeleine. This is an emotionally complex pairing, a coupling in which each person knows each other's needs for the other, knows how desperate both of them are, and at the same time, knows there is tenderness lurking in there somewhere--it's just a matter of teasing it out.

The film is shot through with great flashes of lyricism and visual panache, and was the winner of Un Certain Regard at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival. It's easy to see why; this is a unique work of cinema that shows a real talent who has both book smarts and street smarts and a heart as well.

7886370,4,6305260591,"I saw myself in this film of probable mistaken identity.

 It is the story of a man who loses everything and ends up in a New York homeless shelter with people who are very petty and is basically an outsider. So on a ""Sunday"" he takes a walk and runs into a women who mistakes him for a film director and they spend the day together. I liked this film as it is a small world film ( Small world films are cinema of characters who live lives of small events;the lost of a job,making a change,finding love, getting through a day. films to see...Dogfight,Palookaville,A Thousand Clowns,the Goodbye People,Death of a salesman) As note this cinema has a carnal scene between Madeleine and Oliver; it happens and may shock some people that people 40 and over actually fornicate. It is not very romantic or a love scene out of a movie like Moll Flanders,Lady Chatterley's Lover  or Tom Jones. So spend ""Sunday"" with these characters and visit the small world",1100908800,3,950,4.576470588235294
7886371,4,6305260591,"Rather than detail the specifics of plot and character (other reviewers have done this quite well), I'd like to express my gratitude to director Jonathan Nossiter and his superb leads, David Suchet and Lisa Harrow, for a film that shows us the small gifts that may come to every life--even the lives of those whose main achievements are that they have survived.  Surrounded on all sides by the brainless offerings of popular culture, this beautifully shot and acted small film is a revelation.",982540800,6,493,4.9397590361445785
7886372,4,6305260591,"The movie  ""SUNDAY.""  An amazing piece of recognition.  Recognition of need and warmth counterpoised against the routine pretense of recognition which accompanied one's life in the past.
The woman has lived a long time with failure, with the illusion of promise which the future might bring.  A new man, renewal of a career, that relationship which defies definition, but which can weave a magical web of  mystery around the usual day to day events of life. The woman's question:  I am still beautiful, I can act and speak and make audiences cry.  Why am I left behind then, with my image worshipped still, at an altar which does not contain me?
The man has not lived so long with failure, is still enduring the shock of it, in jagged shots of vision-as  a camera, flashing past sights no one ever wanted to see; persistent glimpses which go in and out of focus as in a dream, a nightmare-where eyeglasses produce a truth which eyes do not wish to see.  His escape from truth, he can remove the eyeglasses and see nothing.  Life has become a pile-up of trash, in rain spattered streets still blotched with late winter's snow.  In spite of looking, your eyes refuse to grasp it, to integrate scene after scene with reason or meaning.
I watch the screen in amazement.  I wonder how a story will emerge from the bad weather, bad views, bad tasting dark and light which tell the story of a fractured and blighted society. The society which we don't see or hear or care to see.  Yet this bitter, broken place contains the music and the vital energy of all races, all nationalities.  This energy, though misdirected at times, can still break through the clutter to beauty, unbelievably.",979516800,9,1680,4.650847457627119
