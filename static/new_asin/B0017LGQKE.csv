3173457,5,B0017LGQKE,"First of all people this is just movie 1 not the collection of the four. Well the price of the dvd is very reasonable considering I got this for 6 bucks with shipping included so the deal is great. This movie is remastered in HD and consists of GSD episodes 1-13 so it ends with Kira piloting the Freedom Gundam again. This movie has new scenes created for the movie and also has deleted some scenes like Shinn badmouthing Cagalli (which was one of the best scenes from Shinn in my eyes cause Cagalli sucks in this show pretty much)and adding a scene where Kira had a sad look when the Zaft soliders self detonated. Overall the dvd is nicely done and makes up for a good amount of flaws in the show but the recycled animation stays.

Reasons to buy this:
GSD fan
The first half of the series is better
When Shinn was the protagonist of the show
A decent amount wasn't recycled animation until later where it completely is the series

I enjoyed the movie so I give it 5 stars.",1360281600,4,975,4.293478260869565

I returned it as instructions given by Amazon because I found the price to be excessive. The refund was accepted but my credit card was only reimbursed for 22.00. I was stiffed for half the movie price with no explanation as to why.

3173463,5,B0017LGQKE,"If you don't have the time to see all 50 episdes, and looking for a condense version of the story, while still remaining true to the overall theme, this is it. Some say this is rewrite of the original gundam story even though I didn't see to many similarities but it is one of the best mecha anime, wortth your while.",1269561600,,317,4.213114754098361
3173464,5,B0017LGQKE,"Many were unpleased with the three Special Edition movies covering the original Gundam Seed Series. 48 Episodes, not counting the two clips shows were compressed into three 90 minute features. Many parts of the story were cut that fans felt were important. Not even the additon of a few new scenes and the improved animation quality was enough to sell most fans. However, for the sequel series Gundam Seed Destiny there are four movies instead of three. Also the Destiny series had four clip shows instead of two and even in some of the other episodes there are often flashback frame montages. So all together there's only about 45 episodes worth of material to cover and that includes the extra scenes from Final Plus. So with less material to cover and four movies instead of three the Special Editions for Gundam Seed Destiny overall were much better than the original Seed Trilogy.

This movie covers the major events that happened during episodes 14-28. This was easily the best of the four Gundam Seed Destiny movies. Everything that was awesome and relevant that I wanted to see was there and everything that was horrible and irrelevant wasn't. The first movie had the potential to be the best, but since it covered episodes 1-13, the best segment of the series there were some good things that were cut. Not in this one though. The battle near an Alliance Base, the battle of Dardanelles and the battle around Crete are all here. The widescreen format and improved animation makes for a fine presentation.

There were a few changes made and a few new things added. For one Miriallia is already on the Archangel when it leaves Orb, eliminating all the scenes where she's on her own as a photographer. Lunamaria is the one that rescues Shinn and Stella from the cave instead of Athrun, this was done to put more emphasis on her relationship with Shinn since all scenes showing her crush on Athrun are removed. During the meeting between Durandal and the main members of the Minerva crew instead of Durandal doing all the talking about war and profit Rey is given some of the dialogue instead of being quiet during the whole affair in the series, showing insight about his character earlier in the story. In the series he was in the background till about episode 33 when he became more involved out of nowhere. Lastly when Kira in the Freedom obliterates the Saviour its phased shift colored armor fades as it comes apart which makes sense given that it was damaged beyond repair. In the series the colored armor was retained which made no sense. The new song Tears by Lisa that plays during the ending credits was really good. There are a few new things that I didn't mention that you should check out.

One who hasn't seen the series and watches this might say it's a bit rushed. Trust me you're not missing anything. As someone who has watched the series twice I can say the fast paced Special Editions are more enjoyable than the often slow moving series. Unlike the original Gundam Seed when if I had to choose between the boxsets of the series or the Special Editions I'd choose the series easily I would say the opposite for Destiny. If you watch all four movies and still want more go for it. Either way you won't be disapointed with this disc.",1250726400,4,3257,4.651041666666667
3173465,4,B0017LGQKE,"Like the third movie of the original Gundam Seed Trilogy this movie covers a shorter range of episodes, making it better. This first of four movies covers episodes 1-13 of Gundam Seed Destiny. It flows really well because many of the scenes were redone, new things were inserted. A few new things were added like in the preceeding movies, but nothing major.

The creators felt that Athrun Zala's character being a narrator in this movie would give the story a more neutral point of few. Overall I have to disagree with this. Very rarely did we see Athrun in the series whole heartingly support ZAFT or stand by Shinn. At the end of the day his loyalties went to Kira and Orb first and foremost. Due to this though new scenes are added in the beginning as transition pieces. Athrun and Cagalli getting on a ship about to go into space, Kira and Lacus walking on a beach, Shinn and Rey messing around with their mobile suits and the Coordinator terrorists before they start their attack. During this we hear Athrun give the same Monologue Rey did at the start of Gundam Seed Destiny: Final Plus about mankind first eating the fruit from the tree of knowledge.

Any new scenes with action such as Athrun piloting the Zaku or at Junius 7 I'm all for, but at the same time they cut some of the action also. Little things like a scene of Rey just briefly looking at Chairman Durandal I don't really see the point of. Since the entire fourth episode was cut the scene where Chairman Durandal reveals Athrun's identity is redone. He reveals it at the same time Athrun asks Captain Gladys for a mobile suit to help break up Junius 7. Also Cagalli learns that Shinn is from Orb during the same time he denounces it along with the Athha's rathar than earlier when Shinn gives her the evil eye in the series which was cut. Some of the dialogue in this scene was also changed. I understand why they did this but Shinn giving Cagalli the evil eye was one of my favorite scenes.

Most of the scenes of Lunamaria conversing with Athrun are cut because the creators chose to ignore her crush on him completely and instead focus more on her relationship with Shinn. Since nothing happened between Athrun and Lunamaria I get it, but the scene when Lunamaria see's Meer in her night gown in Athrun's room was pretty funny. I bet that will be cut in the second movie.

I don't understand why the scenes when Kira hugs Lacus and gets the keys to open the gate to the Freedom Gundam is redrawn, but it does look better. Like the other movies the animation overall looks much better than in the series and is shown in Widescreen format. A remixed version of the song Zips by T.M. Revolution is heard when Shinn first summons the power of the Seed and defeats the Earth Forces fleet. It was alright, but I prefer the original version. When the Coordinators who attempt to assassinate Lacus commit suicide Kira shows a shocked expression rather than a blank one, that's much more like Kira. He really doesn't like it when people die. I really don't like it when they start showing the credits when footage is still being shown. They do offer a textless ending in the bonus features, but I'd rather it be a part of the movie. The new song played at the end, Result by Nami Tamaki was pretty good.

Overall you won't be disapointed if you check this out. As always I have to point out that it could've been longer time wise. Still a fun watch if you want to see the story again.",1218672000,7,3450,4.4525316455696204

8266370,1,B0017LGQKE,"I want to be very clear here. I picked Seed and Seed Destiny up dvd by pre-ordered dvd as they came out almost a decade ago. Seed was decent, but there was a point for everyone where they realized it wasn't a good series. Destiny, didn't even have that. Given that they managed to distill a 20 hour series into an hour thirty minutes without losing a lot should tell you a lot. Put simply, skip this, don't buy it, don't talk about it and just forget it exists. The series is horible, the movie less so but only because they cut out the constant flashbacks. Again, if you want a good anime look else where. Want a good Gundam, check out the Gundam 00 or Gundam Wing both are much better than this.
