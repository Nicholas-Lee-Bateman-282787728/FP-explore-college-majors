5085207,4,B007G8MN1S,"Although some things in the movie aren't exactly true, even though it states it is, it is a better than average Titanic movie. Of course, nothing even comes close to, A Night to Remember, but it does tell about those who were working to in the boiler rooms who didn't get all the praise they deserved. The best thing about the block buster movie, Titanic, is that it started another round of new books and movies about the ship. Now,I am happy to see more new books due to the one hundred anniversary. Keep them coming.",1340150400,3,519,4.416666666666667
5085208,5,B007G8MN1S,I just finished watching this amazing program. I must say that I am moved by the courage and attitude of Titanic's engineers who went down with her that night. Their sacrifice resulted in the saving of 705 lives! I recommend this program to all!,1335830400,,245,4.590909090909091
5085209,4,B007G8MN1S,"The televised version is less than 60 minutes while this version is described as 90 minutes.  I am anxious to see if this version is presented as an outright drama or as the narrated, dramatised documentary shown on PBS.  Either way, it will be good.

UPDATE:  I have seen it now and it is better than the version shown on PBS.  It is interesting to see the parts that were cut out.  I don't known why they edited it for PBS unless they thought the U.S. viewers would not understand part of it.  If you like movies about the Titanic you need to get this one; it shows a side of the events that you don't normally see.",1334534400,16,617,4.177966101694915
5085210,5,B007G8MN1S,"I also watched this PBS program and I have to say it brought me to tears, just seeing those brave Irsihmen working in the bowels of the ship, keeping the lights on for the passengers to board the lifeboats. Without their bravery and sacrifice, they would have been more casualties. This is truly a sad story and not one known by all who have an interest in the disaster. The acting is first rate and it will brings it home, when you see the actual photos of those brave souls at the end of the program. I cannot wait to purchase the dvd.",1334275200,24,537,4.223300970873787
5085211,4,B007G8MN1S,"If you think you've seen about everything about The Titanic to which another movie would just be a rehash then think again.  This is a more insiders look at the men who kept The Titanic afloat beyond what the ship''s chief designer said was possible.  In doing this the electricians, engineers, and a portion of the stokers gave many more people the opportunity to become survivors.  The electricians as group, for instance, worked feverishly to the point none of them survived.  This is a kind of celebration of a select group of worker's heroic actions and their story finally gets its due here.  The actors though unknown to me brought these men to life in a very entertaining way, so well it fact it honors their memories as no other film about the ship has done.  Well worth a watch.",1505260800,,788,4.5928571428571425
5085212,5,B007G8MN1S,great!!!,1503964800,,8,8.0
5085213,5,B007G8MN1S,Although there have been countless movies about the Titanic. This movie centers on the importance of the electricians who kept the lights on until the end. Without their support many more passengers would have been lost. So why not purchase the film for yourself to see how they accomplish this.,1494288000,3,295,4.92
5085214,5,B007G8MN1S,Great gift for my husband,1465084800,,25,4.2
5085215,5,B007G8MN1S,Gives a different side of the Titanic story by explaining what was going on down in the engine and boiler rooms. Those men did save lives at the cost of theirs.,1438905600,,160,4.193548387096774
5085216,5,B007G8MN1S,"My husband loves this- it was a gift. He says that this is from the perspective of the engineers, brought out that the Titanic lasted longer than it might have due to their bravery.  His main praise (and he is picky about this) is that it ""seems to be historically quite accurate!""  That is high praise from him indeed!",1438300800,4,319,4.389830508474576
5085217,5,B007G8MN1S,"THIS IS ABOUT THE MEN WHO WORKED BELOW THE TITANIC IN THE BOILER ROOMS. THIS IS THERE STORY AND SAD OF COURSE, ITS WELL WORTH THE MONEY TO WATCH THIS FROM THERE POINT OF VIEW. WHO WOULDA EVER THOUGHT. SO SAD. GREAT MOVIE.",1430870400,,221,4.162790697674419

5085223,5,B007G8MN1S,"A good and interesting story line, from the perspective of the engineers and crew..  All hero's who stayed at their stations, and eventually went down w/ the ship.  Worth adding to your dvd collection..",1391644800,,202,4.911764705882353
5085224,5,B007G8MN1S,This was something my husband wanted.  He has always been interested in historical documentaries and wanted this.  He said it was great.  Thank you for offering this product.,1375574400,,174,5.142857142857143
5085225,4,B007G8MN1S,"This is a really hard story for me to watch, but I think it is really good and it looks at and honors those people who were not readily recognized at the time or remembered for their heroic efforts by historians.  I am glad to have it in my own library as it takes repeated watching for me to absorb all that is there.",1375142400,2,318,3.96875
5085226,5,B007G8MN1S,"I enjoyed this story of Titanic. You hear about the passengers and what happened to them, but what about the crew? This movie does just that!",1371513600,2,141,4.461538461538462
5085227,5,B007G8MN1S,"VERY INFORMATIVE , PROTRAYING  THE  OFFICERS AND  THE STOKER MEN IN THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP TRYING DESPERATLEY TO SAVE THE TITANIC  FROM SINKING",1368921600,2,143,4.833333333333333
5085228,5,B007G8MN1S,I watched this on TV when it first came out. I enjoyed it so much I purchased it when it came out on DVD. This version tells you what the crew must have gone through and the sacrifice they made in keeping the Titanic afloat and the lights on for as long as possible. If you are a Titanic fan this is a must have for your collection.,1361836800,3,332,3.8970588235294117
5085229,5,B007G8MN1S,"Honestly, this is one of the best docs I have ever seen. Sitting somewhere between documentary and drama, it is informative, engaging, and emotional. The acting is great and the effects/sets are movie-worthy. I origionally watched it online via the CBC and I knew I had to own it. Titanic docs tend toget repeditive, but StT's story of the workers on board is definately woth the time/money.",1361836800,,391,4.850746268656716
5085230,5,B007G8MN1S,"This is a very well acted documentary that receates what life was like for those Titanic crew members who worked down in the boiler and engine rooms of the famous ship.  The film is told through the memories of Lead Fireman, Fredrick Barret.  Barret was one of the few men who remained onboard after the collision, toiling away in the boiler rooms of the ship; and he ended up being the only man to survive the sinking who had actually witnessed the impact from inside the vessel.  He personally saw the hull rupture, giving way to sea water flooding into the ship's first five compartments, and thereby assuring her loss.  The film tells his story in retrospect, while he's seated(presumably in England)before a group of Board members of the White Star Line.  They are looking for stories of heroism that they hope will counter all the negative news stories about the ship's sinking, that are so well known today.  The film traces Barrets actions from the time the ship leaves Belfast after her trials, it then covers the preparations for the start of the maiden voyage while docked at Southampton, and finally the start of the first voyage itself.  The viewer is introduced to a number of additional crew members, mainly Engineers, and Electricians, who, as Officers on the Titanic, were responcible for overseeing the daily mechanical operations of the new ship.

But the film also tells its' story in relation to what it was actually like for people living at that time.  Along with their kits and clothing, these crew members brought additional, personal baggage onboard that really impacted how this group of men got along with each other. Things like the ridged class structure, the religious wars taking place, particularly in Ireland where the ship was built, and finally, the rank structure of the crew itself.  All of these elements combined and they directly affected these men's lives during their daily routines at sea.  This film tells the story of the hardest working section of the ship; it's also the section that ended up having the fewest survivors.  Many of these men remained at their posts, trying first to save the ship, and then later, when fully aware that there was no longer any hope, their efforts then became to simply try to extend her life for as long as possible.  Their vital and heroic work saved hundreds of lives, and yet, their story is one of the less commonly covered aspects of this much written about disaster.  Everything about the production is truly first rate.  Excellent sets, and equally excellent acting, make this one of the best documentaries on this subject you will ever see.",1360627200,6,2628,4.834821428571429
5085231,5,B007G8MN1S,I watched this on TV & just knew I had to own this DVD.  It's portrayal of events from those with lower ranks is riveting.  A must watch for anyone with an interest in the Titanic.,1360195200,,180,3.9722222222222223
5085232,5,B007G8MN1S,I found the DVD very interesting and learned about a few of the Engineers who stayed below trying to keep the Titanic a float long as possible.,1359331200,,143,4.333333333333333
5085233,5,B007G8MN1S,"I saw this program by ordering it through cable while my husband was at work. I was having a Titanic marathon with all the shows, seeing how it was the cenntenial and all. This show brought me to tears. i do remember doing a Titanic report about men like this in the 6th grade but no one gave a second thought. Now that its on TV it makes the story more real and tragic yet they were brave to do what they did to prolong the life of the ship just a little more. To try and save as many lives as possible. I would definately recommend",1359331200,,533,3.9906542056074765
5085234,4,B007G8MN1S,"My earlier review confused two different TITANIC dvd's, which have very similar titles.  Something I just recently discovered.  This extended version is a must have for anyone seeking to know more about the inner workings of TITANIC before it's tragic loss.  It brings home the point that mor than just passengers were lost.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1357084800,,345,5.218181818181818
5085235,5,B007G8MN1S,I have seen several movies and read many books on the Titanic and this docudrama is one of the most informative ones.  It never occured to me that there was so much going on below deck to keep the Titanic afloat so more passengers could be saved. It had infoamtion in it that I had never heard nor seen and it really amazed me to say the least.  Just when I thought I knew it all this came along.  I have watched it twice on PBS.  It is an hour long packed full of interesting information.  I highly recommend this video.,1355875200,2,521,4.118811881188119
5085236,5,B007G8MN1S,"Much more moving than the James Cameron movie (which I did like) - tells the story from the perspective of the (non-fictional) boiler room workers & the engineers, how they kept Titanic afloat for as long as possible, and saved lives.  It's documentaries like this why I love PBS.",1355529600,,280,4.714285714285714
5085237,5,B007G8MN1S,Wonderful story and probably all true.  This is the story of what happened to many of the officers and seamen that served on this ship.,1355097600,,135,4.4
5085238,5,B007G8MN1S,"If you want to watch something a little different on the Titanic story that has not been ""rehashed"" over and over again; this DVD may very well be for you. It is a poignant story about the brave & ""nameless"" men who worked in the bowels of the ship right up until the time the Titanic foundered. Not one engineer survived to tell his side of the story, they stayed at their posts till the very end so others would stand a chance of survival. It is to their credit the lights on the Titanic stayed on till just before the Titanic plunged to her icy grave, with power to the very end Jack Phillips & Harold McBride, the Marconi operators, were able to send out distress calls to attract nearby ships and to keep the Carpathia updated on their plight as she rushed to their aid. Along with the help of the firemen & trimmers, the engineers managed to keep the pumps working effectively to keep the ship afloat longer than expected. Highly recommended DVD for people who like more quality & ""substance"" in their viewing of the Titanic story.",1348272000,3,1037,4.43455497382199
5085239,5,B007G8MN1S,"Superb! This is a true story of the century about the human spirit, with first class acting, incredible photography, effective dialogue as well as non-verbal messages throughout. The sacrifice of the workers in the boiler room whose super-efforts delayed the sinking of the ship and thereby gave time to save more lives is brought to light. These heroes did not receive the credit they deserved. Their courage to do the extremely hard work under the most difficult conditions should have been saluted to the full extent.

There is a touch of information on the workers' personal lives, dilemmas and heartbreaks, pains of separation from their families, serious conflicts based on religion, general depression caused by the boiler room job (""Do you remember the Sun?""), and unfair treatments by bosses including over-work and pay-cuts, all of which give strong clues on the social, religious, and economic history of their times.

It is the true story of human decency, going way beyond the call of duty, total sacrifice, standing up for principles, bravery, and jobs well-done strictly from the sense of duty and compassion-being human at its best.",1347580800,4,1148,5.166666666666667
5085240,5,B007G8MN1S,"The heroics of the crew on of deck the RMS Titanic on the night of 14-15 April 1912, is well known but below deck little, if anything, has been written. Having seen this dvd, I now know of a whole new level of courage. Facing certain death the seinor engineering staff stayed at their posts untill there was nothing left to do. Because of their efforts many more lived to see the dawn of a new day. As we remember those who died that night, let these brave souls rank amoung the very few who place the life of others before their own. God speed these heroes of the high seas.",1347494400,6,575,4.1891891891891895
