If you are a mystery lover and like British detectives, I can recommend Lynley.  Like Morse, Inspector Detective Lynley is not the usual run-of-the-mill Scotland Yard man.  From an aristocratic old, and wealthy family, very well educated at Cambridge, good looking and sophisticated, he bridges the gap and the jeers of his co-workers very well and always gets the case solved.  His partner is a working class woman from London who at first, has nothing but dislike for Lynley, but she has been assigned to him because she has been unable to get along with anyone else, and they are trying to make her quit by putting her with Lynley.  Their strengths come together to make a terrific team in solving mysteries.  Their backgrounds are also delved into and the love story of Lynley and Helen is believable. The sadness, worry and expense of Havers (Lynley's partner) in dealing with her mother's dementia is also very touching and timely. I loved the series and have added it to my collection.",1243641600,,1188,5.646067415730337

8216581,5,B000V5YP1Y,We have now seen seasons 1 & 2. The begining of this series was grimmer than we had thought but then murders aren't pretty. We have enjoyed watching the series progress. Each disk holds 1 show and is about one and a half hours. These come nicely boxed and unfold to reveal about 8 disks per container. If you like British mysteries then get this set. Would make a great gift for a mystery lover.,1221436800,,395,4.28

Fans of British mystery can't get enough of this stellar gem. Now that its future is in doubt, and fans are trying to convince the BBC to go forward with the show, we can look back and appreciate just how good this series showcased on PBS's ""Mystery"" has been. Nathaniel Parker's Inspector Lynley and Sharon Small's Barbara Havers have become the finest duo on television, mystery or otherwise.

The Inspector Lynley series is smart and atmospheric, Debbie Wiseman's opening music setting the tone for each intriguing installment. Based on Elizabeth George's characters, the BBC show has grown and matured beyond the books, which has frustrated some yet delighted others. The dashing Lynley was originally paired with Havers because it was taken for granted he would not be distracted by her in a romantic way. He was Oxford and she was from the other side of life.

The clashes that came in the first two seasons due to those differences became less important as the two quickly found there was more to each other than their reputations. They proved a great team and became quite close, their deep friendship and affection for each other rarely dwelled upon but always there beneath the surface. By season three when personal crisis hit both of them hard it was each other to which they clung.

By season five the series had become more than the sum of its parts. Havers had softened some over time and Lynley had become more accessible, both due to the influence of the other. Season five began with Lynley suspended pending an inquiry into brutality charges. Barbara has been paired with a new D.I., a very pregnant one a bit caustic regarding Lynley who, for his part, does not endear himself to her when he unofficially starts helping and thinks she is overlooking promising leads.

""Natural Causes"" began the season in fine style, and even some fun, as towards the conclusion Havers is the D.I., Lynley doing her bidding. The final episode finds a murder in Soho tied to Bosnia, even Lynley's Helen, winningly portrayed in season five by Catherine Russell, lending a helping hand. But this bookend to the season had tragic overtones, Lynley discovering an entire world can change in ""The Blink of an Eye.""

Parker and Small are fabulous in their roles, giving carefully nuanced performances in mysteries both intelligent and entertaining. If not for PBS this marvelous British series might not have garnered so many fans. Those just discovering this fine series and wanting to catch up with all the happenings prior to the short season six, will definitely find plenty to write home about, as the saying goes, with this set. The episodes are as follows:

SEASON ONE / Well-Schooled in Murder --- Payment in Blood --- For the Sake of Elena --- Missing Joseph SEASON TWO / Playing for the Ashes --- In the Presence of the Enemy --- A Suitable Vengeance --- Deception on His Mind SEASON THREE / In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner --- A Traitor to Memory --- A Cry for Justice --- If Wishes Were Horses SEASON FOUR / In Divine Proportion --- In the Guise of Death --- The Seed of Cunning --- The Word of God SEASON FIVE --- Natural Causes --- One Guilty Deed --- Chinese Walls --- In the Blink of an Eye

Fans of quality television and especially mystery lovers will find a bonanza in these 20 installments starring Nathaniel Parker and Sharon Small as Lynley and Havers. Fans truly cherish this show as much as Lynley does his cars. Hopefully fans of this fine show will prevail so we can continue to follow this most literate and atmospheric of mystery series.",1214956800,12,3658,4.731554160125588
8216583,5,B000V5YP1Y,"This is a well produced and acted British murder series which illistrates the class differences still in existence today in modern England. Havers. a working class girl with a broad accent and no polish teamed with a member of the aristocracy, plummy accent and public schooled (ie private in England!) Really well done, from the fine books by Elizabeth George. Beautiful scenery in some and always interesting plots. A first rate series and well worth watching.",1208476800,9,462,5.092105263157895
