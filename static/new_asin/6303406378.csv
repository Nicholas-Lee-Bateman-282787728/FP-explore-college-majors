But, if it is suspected that Riker used his phaser to shoot the generator, wouldn't such a ""progressive"", peaceful future track the use of a lethal weapon? People are accessable at the touch of a communicator ""badge"", trackable on board the ship via same, and apparently all have to log their activities (officers anyway), and in general live under a huge microscope. Yet, in an age of high technology, a lethal instrument that could easily have a computer chip to log every stardate it was fired has no such thing. Just doesn't fit in the whole Star Trek collectivist milieu.",1181260800,,640,4.663716814159292

Read no futher if you want to see the ending...
This one is an otherwise run of the mill episode made interesting by three different points of view of the same story.
We have Riker charged with murder when in fact it's the scientist's experiment that is responsible for the radiation that destroyed the station and almost finished the Enterprise.
We get the wife of the fellow developing this ""Kreiger"" ray project...she claims Riker made unwanted advances when it was actually her was doing all the advancing. The unethical assistant said he was also going after Krieger's wife. It all turns out to be false when the radiation from his experiment is putting holes in the Enterprise hull and insides of the ship.
It's all put to rest when the radiation bursts are 5.3 hours apart. It's at just such an interval when the station blew up.
All in all it's a good episode. It's worth it to put this one in your collection.",1012435200,,946,4.603550295857988
