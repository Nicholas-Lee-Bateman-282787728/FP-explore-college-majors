2120291,4,B0002UENEC,"Gunsmoke was often a good show but they did have a lot of lemons
too. This collection has pretty good shows. It's in the old west
of course, and it has things of historical interest you might not know about today.

""The Cabin"" is an especially good show. It was made in response
to complaints that Gunsmoke had ""gone soft"". ""The Cabin"" has a tough edge to it.",1284768000,,359,4.279411764705882
2120292,5,B0002UENEC,"These two episodes are from Gunsmoke's tenth season. They are: 1)Avenger: Late one night Thad Greenwood comes to get Festus and tells him there is trouble at the long branch. They get there and there is no more trouble. Kitty took care of. Well as Festus and Thad are walking back down to the jail house, they hear a window breaking. Looking to see what it is, they see it is Miss Kitty's room. They get there and find a young drunk cowboy trying to get his way with Kitty. Festus is forced to kill the man. Well a few days later the family of the cowboy, his father a judge in a different state and his other two sons come to Dodge to see Festus and Kitty hang for the death of the cowboy. Well Matt says no way and tells them to clear out of Dodge and Kansas for that matter. They do not. Matt and Thad are walking and Matt gets shot by a snipper hiding behind a wagon in the leg. The next morning they discover that Festus and Kitty are missing. Matt, right in front of Doc who tells Matt he can't travel, tells Thad to go saddle up two horses for himself and for Thad. Well Doc has something to say about this but is ignored. Then Doc is kidnapped after Matt and Thad and bartender Sam Nolan ride out after Festus and Kitty. Matt finds Kitty, Festus, and Doc and in the end one of the judge's other son's is killed. The Judge and his youngest son are arrested. 2)Gold Mine: A good episode mainly with Thad and Kitty only and a few guest stars. Matt is out of town but before he leaves Kitty and he have a fight over a gold mine in a very bad town that she has inheritted. Matt tells her to wait until he gets back and they will go together, Kitty decides to ignore him and goes anyway by her self. Matt gets back, hears about this and is furious. So he sends young Thad to go after her, send a letter back to him saying that she is alright, and then bring her stubborn rear end back to Dodge. Thad goes and gets there plum tired and worn out and Kitty tells him that he is not going to send the letter until he gets some rest. Well all in all, things happen and Thad ends up getting shot in the arm and Kitty telling him the wound, though in the arm is still serious and tells him he needs to stay in bed. Thad never gets the letter out and Matt ends up going after both of them.

Two really great episodes to watch.",1225756800,3,2473,4.028455284552845
2120293,5,B0002UENEC,"These episodes of Gunsmoke are from the sixth season. They are: 1) Potshot: Chester is shot by a snipper with a rifle and is seriously injured. Matt later begins to realize that the shot was ment for him and not Chester. This makes Matt feel extremely angry and guilty to the point of wanting more then anything to catch the shooter, and he refuses to let anyone help him. Matt believes that it was bank robbers that robbed a bank in another town are now in Dodge and it was they who shot Chester, well he later finds out that they didn't. The episode has an intresting twist to it at the end when Matt finds out who really shot Chester. A very great episode with Matt and Chester and it really shows just how close the two of them are. 2)Chester's Dilemma: A good episode and an intresting one. Chester is helping this young lady who has come to dodge get a job and a place to stay. Later, Chester realizes that she stole a very important letter ment for Matt. Chester has to try to figure out how he will deal with this situation. Another great episode with a great moment between Chester and Matt and even having Matt admit to Chester that Chester is the only man he can really depend on next to Doc. 3)The Love of Money: Not the best episode but it's still very good. A ex-lawman and a very good friend of Matt's comes to Dodge to see Matt and is later killed by being shot in the back. This upsets Matt and Chester, but mainly Matt to the point where he offers a $500 dollar reward for the killer. The killer is found because the girlfriend of the killer turns him in all so she could have the money. 4)Colorado Sheriff: A very intresting episode and yet a little confusing at the end. Matt and Chester are out riding on the prairie when they find a young man shot in the back, yet still alive. He tells them that a stranger in which he was riding with shot him and then took off, well the ""Stranger"" did not take off and ends up firing shots at the young man, Chester and Matt. Matt hits the ""stranger"" in the shoulder but he still gets away. A few days later Doc tells Matt he took a bullet out of a man's shoulder. The man tells Matt he is a Colorado Deputy Sheriff out to arrest the man that was shot in the back for bank robbery. At the end three men are dead and Matt finds out the true identity of the so called ""Deputy Sheriff""",1225670400,2,2340,4.179203539823009
2120294,5,B0002UENEC,"This is I think Season five or six. Not really sure on that. They are: 1)Kitty's Injury: Don't like this episode at all. Matt and Kitty are out riding, her horse throws her and she becomes seriously injured. Matt takes her to a house where a family lives with their very insane son. Not a great episode. 2) Where'd They Go?: A hilarious episode featuring Matt and Chester out looking for a man said to have robbed the store. They find the man at his house and he agrees to go in to town with them, but only after Matt and Chester do all of his ranch chores for him. After all is done, they find out the truth about who really robbed the store. Very funny episode. 3)Colleen So Green: Another great and funny episode. A young, very pretty girl comes to Dodge, claims that all of her money was stolen. Well she gets almost all of the men in Dodge (except Doc and Matt of course)to buy her things. One man even bought her a house! well in the end, she takes the money they get her and leaves with out saying a word. They then realize that she wasn't so green after all. 4)The Ex-urbanites: A very sweet episode with Doc and Chester. Doc is seriously wounded on the prarie and only Chester is with him. This is actually one of the most dramatic episodes with Doc and Chester involved. We actually see Chester come to tears and pray to save Doc's life. This is the all time best episode with Doc and Chester.",1224633600,4,1403,4.258426966292135
2120295,5,B0002UENEC,"I believe that this is Season five of Gunsmoke. They are: 1) Kangaroo: A very good episode. Chester upsets a Mountain man and his two sons. They kidnap him and hold a court trial on him. They are planning to kill him however an unexpected person saves his life. A great episode. 2) Saludos: Another great episode. An Indian girl is shot in the back, Matt and Chester go out searching for the man who shot her and find the only three white men in the area where she was shot. Matt tells the men that they are going back to Dodge so the Indian girl can Identify the shooter. So the episode is mainly on the priarie with Matt, Chester, and the three men. It has a very intresting twist at the end. 3) Doc Judge: A great episode featuring Doc and Chester. I think it was brilliance on Chester's side and it was a very sweet at the end with the last scene with Doc, Matt, and Chester. In a nut shell, Chester ends up saving Doc's life. 4)Kitty's Killing: Not the best episode but a good episode. Very hillarious in the begining with a very scary man and Chester. All in all, good episodes to watch.",1224633600,2,1093,4.23444976076555
2120296,4,B0002UENEC,"These episodes are from Gunsmoke season three. They are: 1) Kitty's Outlaw: A great episode and it really takes us into the past of Kitty Russell. 2) Twelfth Night: A very funny episode featuring mostly Matt and Chester. Some scenes with Doc and Kitty. Basically about two hill-billies that want to kill each other but can't because it's sunday. Matt and Chester go and try to find them on Monday before they do kill each other. All in all, a very hilarious episode. 3) Buffalo Man: Not the best episode. Only really  has Matt and Chester and like three other guest stars. No real action at all and though it's a good episode, I've seen better in the third season. 4) The Cabin: The worst episode of season three. This episode was very dull, no action. Only featured Matt and three guest stars and it only takes place in a cabin the whole episode. Season three has great episodes, this is NOT one of them.",1224633600,3,905,4.484848484848484
2120297,5,B0002UENEC,"I believe this is the 4th season.  It delves into the childhood Chester had and Kitty's original occupation and how she started to become owner of the saloon.  If you watch TV Land the 1 hr color shows, This will explain the characters and how they evolved.",1189814400,2,257,4.446808510638298

8031972,1,B0002UENEC,The episode I ordered was ''The Badge''from I think 1973 which is a classic episode. I received the episode from 1960 with the same title which was the wrong one.,1367452800,,162,4.433333333333334

8031975,5,B0002UENEC,"""The Colonel"" was produced late in Lee J. Cobb's career.  It may be the only work he ever shared with his daughter, Julie Cobb.  For that reason, it is a very valuable acquisition for fans of either or both actors, of which I am one.  Amazon made this purchase possible, and the seller handled the sale professionally and promptly.  Although the earlier reviewer had some personal point of view critical evalution that was quite articulate, any fans of the Cobbs will be very satisfied.",1294790400,,486,4.75
8031976,5,B0002UENEC,"Cannot say enough about the episode of ""The Cabin"" - such an original plot involving our Matt Dillon! It's true we don't get all the characters together in this one but hey, once in a while it's okay to break the mold! This episode is one of my favorites and am so glad to have it on VHS! The unforgettable Harry Dean Stanton and Claude Akins star as the baddies...and Matt has to go up against them himself.....watch it, you won't be disappointed!",1294012800,,448,4.409638554216867
