Has some cute songs in (one that is a little riskay but I never understood it as a kid). It a was one of those movies that never left the VCR and I am so happy to have found this on DVD.

I took a star off because of the products condition. A cracked case, scratches on the disc, and goop on the other. I never let my things get beyond their original recognition no matter how old and untouched. To me, there's just no call for it. I hope their products improve because aside from that on time and not completely in ruin.",1405555200,,600,4.084745762711864

47238,5,0783222726,I loved this cartoon as a kid and I have looked for it in video stores between 1999 and 2009 with no luck. I was thrilled to find it and purchase it through Amazon. The Chipmunks and Chipettes are so cute yet their cool. I loved all the songs in this movie and have watched this movie dozens of times. It was cool the way they unwittingly helped Claus and Claudia but in the end cracked their diamond smuggling ring. The twist with Inspector Jamal was a classic twist. It was funny the way they always dressed Sophie the dog in the bowtie with the same pattern as obnoxious Claudia's outfit and nail polish done the same. Overall it was a brilliant animation piece.,1391472000,,665,4.370967741935484

47331,5,0783222726,"They don't make cartoons like this anymore. This is the original '80s Chipmunks, not the live animation nonsense they have today. Ugh.

At the start of the movie, Alvin is pestering David to take him, with him, on his business trip to Europe. David says ""no"" and that he has to stay behind with the elderly Miss Miller.

Later on, The Chipmunks and their friends, The Chipettes, are at the local ice cream parlor playing an arcade game, Around the World in 80 Days. Alvin is still complaining about David's trip to Europe.

At the next table, a typical rich, '80s, couple overhears Alvin's complaining. The couple are actually diamond smugglers and need a dimwitted person to trade the diamonds for cash. The couple confronts the Chipmunks and Chipettes. They trick them into thinking it will be game. They have no idea that they will be escorting diamonds hidden in dolls across Europe.

Alvin then tricks Miss Miller into thinking David called from Europe and is sending the boys over to join him. The next day, they set off on their first quest in hot air balloons.

Like I previously said this children's movie would never work today. You have diamond smuggling, kidnapping, scenes of violence. Parents would be protesting! Ugh.

Amazing movie! I wore out my VHS copy back in the '90s, and bought it when it was re-released on DVD several years back. I'm never parting with it.

In this version they looked like 8 year old KIDS, which is more what I'm used to...

Though, I have to say, charging $94 and change for ONE movie? That's ridiculous and downright SHAMEFUL. I'd be ashamed to PAY that, much less charge it... (And the cheapest USED is $39 and change? Seriously?) I can watch youtube through my blueray player and I recorded this entire movie off of youtube yesterday. For FREE.

I'm 24 and she's 20 but we had both watched this when we were younger (it actually came out a year before my sister was born!) and loved it then.  Watching it the other day was the first time we had seen it since we were quite small and it was as fun and amusing as we remembered.

Then and now we love the idea of traveling around the world and doing fun (and sometimes dangerous) things.  The songs are cute and funny.  My sister and I got a particular kick out of watching Brittany and Jeanette try to snake charm with the song about ""gettin' lucky with you.""  I'd actually love to hear some of those songs non-Chipmunkified so that it'd be easier to sing along with but they are perfectly fun to sing as is too.

When we were little we liked Alvin and Brittany the best as characters but as adults we found them to be annoying and liked characters like Simon much better.  His dry humor when he instructs Alvin to put the balloon by the fountain and Alvin sticks it in the trees (""Like I said, in the tree."") made us crack up.  We never used to like him.

This film is full of catchy music, from 'The Girls of Rock & Roll' to 'Woolly Boolly.'  What surprised me is that, unlike most animated shows of the early 90s, this one wasn't drowning in cheesiness.  It had humor, as well as a couple of truly sentimental moments.  It brought back a lot of memories for me, and I actually watched it two consecutive days, which is rare.  If you're thinking about buying this movie, I'd certainly reccommend it.

But more importantly what is with this cover art?! First of all the characters are WAY off model, but there's something much more sinister at play here- Anyone that's seen the movie knows that there are two balloons in play in the movie- one with the three chipmunks and one with the three chipmunks. This artwork shows us the three boys in one balloon (barely fitting, btw), and in the other balloon we have . . . the villains of the movie Clause and Claidia . . . so where are the three chipettes? Well, as Alvin happily shows off a diamond . . . Theodore holds desperately on to Brittany hovering hundreds of feet above the ground.

47445,4,0783222726,"I remember watching this cartoon as a kid and absolutely loving every minute of it.  I was a huge fan of `The Chipmunks' and watched their cartoon's religiously, so it's only expected that with the birth of my first child right around the corner I would seek out and purchase some cartoons that I myself adore.  `The Chipmunk Adventure' I can honestly say still stacks up even in its old age.  It's funny and entertaining and enjoyable even in my adulthood.  The animation may not be as flashy and realistic as we have today but there's nothing wrong with a good old fashioned cartoon every once in a while.  The storyline is engaging, the characters are likable and the entire feel of this cartoon, the vibe and atmosphere is sure to excite and entertain any child.  There are a few things I found a little annoying but there's not enough here to really complain about.

First let's discuss the storyline.  Dave, the Chipmunks father figure, is traveling to Europe on business and is leaving the boys in the hands of absent minded babysitter Miss Miller.  Alvin is none to happy with this arrangement for he wants to travel with Dave and see the wonders of the world.  He soon gets his opportunity when two shady strangers overhear a conversation, or a fight, between Alvin and Brittany (leader of the Chipettes) in regards to who could really win a race around the world.  It just so happens that these two strangers, Klaus and Claudia, are in need of some transporters to smuggle their stolen diamonds.  They devise a plan rather rapidly to send the Chipmunks and the Chipettes on a race around the world, having them deposit dolls stuffed with diamonds at certain checkpoints along the way.  Of course this group of young rodents doesn't realize the dolls are carrying precious cargo and just feel that these two creepy adults are rich and bored, and besides, the winner will receive $100,000 and that's about all the persuading Alvin and Brittany need.  So, Alvin, Simon and Theodore set off in one direction while Brittany, Jeannette and Eleanor set off in the other and each of them meet danger in varying ways.

The film is filled to the brim with action and adventure and musical numbers.  The musical numbers, as hilarious as they are, present my first lukewarm feeling.  First of all, maybe it's just me, but was it easier to understand what they were singing when we were younger.  I had the hardest time figuring out the words to the songs.  Maybe children can hear at a higher octave than adults can.  Secondly, some of the songs are not songs I'd want my children to sing, some of them are somewhat suggestive (""get lucky with you"") and just not for children.  I know this was the 80's and these songs were popular, but as a soon-to-be parent I find myself a little more judgmental of things.  Like I said though, this is not enough for me to really complain about.

I also would have liked to see the boys really understand the danger in what they did, leaving home unchaperoned, trusting strangers...things of that nature.  Other than Theodore mentioning the guilty feeling once and Simon somewhat bickering in the beginning the boys never really acknowledge how wrong their actions were, nether does Dave for that matter.  I know this is a cartoon, but cartoons are notorious for morals and lessons learnt and I feel that this one could have established those a little better.  Regardless, this is still a fun time and not something I would hesitate to place before my daughter.  It remains a highlight of my youth and I'm hoping it becomes a highlight of hers.",1185753600,,3579,4.675718849840256

47457,5,0783222726,"If kids don't have this movie or have never seen it, they've NO idea what they're missing!!!! This is by far my all-time fave movie in the world! I've watched it so many times I can practically recite half the movie almost word-for-word & I can say the lines with each character while watching the movie, without looking up! Huge Chipmunk fan here, if you couldn't tell already. I may not own everything that has to do with them, but I do have quite a bit. If I'd more money I would so buy every single item on here that I don't have. But, alas, I have to wait patiently for when I do have the money & am not spending it on Ninja Turtle things - my other all-time fave cartoon.

But, yes, this movie is Awesome! The best ever! Kids MUST see this movie!!! I know kids who've never seen the cartoon, yet love this movie anyway thanks to me! *grins* Though, I SWEAR parts of it have been cut out. I got it on VHS back on my 17th birthday in 2001. There's part of the movie that got cut out, but I can't prove it, because somebody taped over the original version I had - thus the bad thing about taping stuff on blank tapes off television. I just wish I could find the original version in the original casing & watch it & prove that there ARE parts of the movie missing - All Chipette parts too! Like when they crash the balloon after the hurricane - Brittany says something about having to blow dry her hair that morning, that's why they can't use it to get the balloon back up & running again. And then when they return the penguin - the baby penguin hugs Eleanor again when they're all in the balloon about to leave the lil' guy behind & Eleanor is supposed to tel him, ""No, you better stay here with your Momma.""

47460,4,0783222726,"Since there is no synopsis, I'd thought I'd write one since I watched this movie a million times or so growing up.

While Dave is on business in Europe, and Mrs. Miller is in charge, Alvin, Simon, Theodore and the Chippettes are, thanks to the competition between Alvin and Brittany, schemed into a ""race"" around the world. The terms are that they race in provided hot-air balloons, and the must deliver and receive a Chipmunk or Chippette doll at various, specific destinations.

The race is sponsored by a very wealthy, Bavarian-like, brother-sister duo, who only say they are ""very bored."" When actually they are part of a diamond smuggling ring that needs a deceptive way to deliver their product.

The plot is the danger that the race puts our main characters into - both because of the bad guys, and the fact that they are racing hot-air balloons around the world. (Maybe this is where Richard Branson got the idea.) Anyway, how the Chipmunks and Chippettes get out of the trouble they put themselves in, not to mention how they deceive Dave and Mrs. Miller about it is the movie.

The thing about the movie versus other Chipmunk escapades is that the songs are original to the movie, not covers. They are rather catchy, and the animation is that nice 1980s, colorfully detailed, kind. The one that's still actually animated and not CGI.

The interesting part is to guess where they are in the world during the various music montages. Oh, and there's a baby penguin.",1167523200,,1472,4.734375

Now the colors are brighter and the film seems to be a bit jerky at times. The characters are too

cartoony.  The lack of the warmer colors diminish the original  quailty of the film. I waited along time only to be disappointed.

 For a first time viewer this movie will still have alot of charm and you and your kids will love it. I give the original version a 5 STAR rating. The DVD only a 3.

In my opinion, the best part of the movie is the ""sing off"" between the chipmuncks and chipettes. The song came back to me in no time.

47466,4,0783222726,"This is a film I've loved ever since I was a child, and even bought the VHS on Amazon a couple of years ago back when the dvd wasn't available.

The dvd version of this film has a few errors in it, such as the fact that several scenes were mysteriously 'cut' -- such as is the case where the Chipets are kidnapped in Cairo and taken into the palace of a young prince, where a segment has been cut-out when the prince is talking to the girls.  This also happens twice again when the Chipmunks are in Fiji -- once when a small segment is cut while the boys are around the camp fire, and then again later in the village.  This happened a couple other times around the film, along with the fact that some poor transitioning/fade effects were added into the dvd version of the movie between scene changes so that scenes would 'fade together'.

Apart from all that, though, it's still a wonderful ""5 star"" film on its on.  ""The Chipmunk Adventure"" has a great plot, and music that's just as great!  I think it's a film people of all ages can enjoy, and definitely worth an 'animated classic' title.",1153612800,2,1092,4.328431372549019

47473,4,0783222726,"""Hugs and Kisses,"" I had the same problem on my DVD: Most of the background dialogue and sound effects were missing. For example, in the beginning when Miss Miller is calling for Dave when she first arrives, you can't hear her yelling when Dave and the chipmunks are reacting to her from upstairs. In the arcade, you can't hear the Chipmunks cheering at the machine right before Claudia yells, ""Noisy brats!"" Then, when Dave calls Miss Miller, you can't hear the phone ring, but yet she goes to pick it up anyway. And you can't hear Alvin talk about how much he loves Athens right before Simon says, ""Alvin, you've never been to Athens."" And when the natives capture them, and Alvin shows them the clothes and radio, you can't hear them reacting in astonishment, and so on. I was really upset until I realized I have to adjust the audio options; the DVD is programmed to already start the movie with the 5.1 surround sound feature, but my TV doesn't have surround sound, as I'm sure most people's TVs don't. I clicked on the ""stereo"" option and skipped to the parts of the movie with the missing audio, and they were there again. In other words, if you had surround sound, you would be able to hear the phone ringing from the speaker behind you and Miss Miller calling from the side of the room, etc.

As for the movie itself, this is possibly the greatest animated kids movie ever, including ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" (it's certainly the most underrated). The only reason why I'm giving the DVD version 4 stars instead of 5 is because I was a little disappointed in the bonus features. There's only some screen caps of artwork, though apparently, you see some ""deleted scenes,"" like when the Chipmunks are captured by a group of dogs who hold them in their mouths. But the DVD didn't even have the trailer! Oh well, it's better than nothing. I'm just glad this classic has been finally released.

Oh, one more thing. Unlike the other ""Chipmunk"" adventures, this isn't Alvin's movie; Simon has all the best lines:

(Theodore tells him to get into the balloon as he's clinging to the side for dear life) ""Why didn't I think of that?""

(Alvin asks him if he knows how to operate the balloon) ""Not a clue, Alvin!""

(Simon tells Alvin to land the balloon by the fountain in Mexico City, but it crashes into a tree instead) ""Like I said, in the tree.""

(Theodore regrets leaving the natives who, after worshipping him as their ""Prince of Plenty,"" decide to sacrifice the three Chipmunks) ""Send them a postcard, Theodore.""",1149033600,4,2538,4.603982300884955

I even brought my niece a copy.  I have a copy on VHS from when I tape it off the Disney Channel, before they started showing commericals.  Need to say it is a bit worn; therefore, I was excited when it was being released on DVD.

47475,5,0783222726,"It is rare that one finds a movie that can be watched by several generations within the same family--baby boomers, generation X-ers and even the X-ers children.  Boomers (and maybe even a few of their parents)will more than likely remember Alvin and his brothers from the 1958 novelty Christmas hit; Gen-Xers, from the show that ran in the 1980s, and for the new generation, this is a great time to introduce the kids to a classic.  (WARNING--POSSIBLE SPOILERS)

Originally released in 1987, the story begins when David Seville, the chipmunks' guardian, goes off to Europe ona business trip, leaving the boys at home with a neighbor as a babysitter.  Ever the schemer, Alvin dreams of world travel on his own, and seems more upset at being left at home than he is oer the departure of his ""parent"".  Enter two sinister, ""Euro-trash"" international smugglers.  A borther and sister pair, they need someone who can deliver 5 million dollars worth of diamonds to their customers overseas without arousing the suspicion of the authorities.  the pair finds in the chipmunks and their girlfriends the perfect couriers, and arranges the diamonds to  be delivered under the guise of a hot-air balloon race around the world with a one-million dollar prize at stake.  The boys and their girlfriends enter the race, not realizing what they were getting themselves into.  Meanwhile, the interpol authorities are tracking the boys, both with the intent of getting the kids home safely and catching the smugglers in the process.

while the movie is largely tame by today's standards, parents should be aware that there are a few racial stereotypes depicted, for example, at a Mexican fiesta, almost all the people are wearing sombreros; in Egypt, the Arabs are decpicted as riding on camels.  While harmless in the 80's, these images have deeper implications for today.  Parents might wish to use these images to prompt discussion regarding international relations and stereotypes.  Parents should also be aware that the female villain, Claudia furstein, smokes regularly and in one scene, sips a martini.

But these detractors are mionor--for many young children in the 80's, this movie was their first exposure to famous world monuments, such as the canals of Venice, Machu Picchu and the pyramids.  Although I had already traveled widely by the time I saw the movie, I still loved it.  When I spent a year in Europe, one of the first places I went was to the PArthenon in Greece, the site of a mjor event in the movie.  I have also gone to other locales that were featured in the movie, never once forgetting where I first saw them.

Numerous live action and cartoon take-offs have been spun from Jules Verne's tale ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" some of which are quite lackluster and tedious. One of the better recent versions starred Sylvester and Tweety in a prelude to their comeback in Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries, which I hope also makes it to DVD. The Great Chimpmunk Adventure, as it is alternately called, takes off from Verne's tale but doesn't stick slavishly to the story, launching instead into a wild flight of fancy.

From the original ""Chipmunk Song"" which spun the chattering trio into the limelight, the Bagdasarians have kept the highest standards for Alvin, Simon and Theodore (and Dave) in radio, TV and film. But the culminating spectacular remains this film, happily now on DVD, where the trio may gain a new showing.",1144886400,,1289,4.8545454545454545
47483,5,0783222726,"This was my all time favorite as a child and I continued to enjoy it into my teen years. I always took this movie with me when I went babysitting and all the kids loved it! It's not as widely known so it was fresh and exciting for the kids. Any type child can identify with any one of the 6 Chipmunks or Chipettes.

One of the sweetest songs in any child's movie is ""My Mother"" sung by a Chipette in this movie. Great family values!",1142985600,3,432,4.023255813953488

At the various stops there are adventures and a song. The family favorite is in Athens where the Chipmunks and the Chippette sing a dueling song of ""The Boys/Girls of Rock 'n Roll"". All the songs are good.

The other characters are interesting. The bad guys, the brother and sister, are the usual snotty, sarcastic type. But they are funny. I love the babysitter. I can't hear someone says, ""is (fill in name) available and not think ""available for what?""

47491,5,0783222726,"I think this was actually one of the first movies I saw in the theater with my Mom and Dad, and it's a great movie! If you're a big chipmunk fan, then you'll especially love it!

In the movie, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore try to beat the Chibettes (I'm not quite sure how to spell that, but they're the three girl chipmunks) in a hot-air balloon race around the world. The trip is full of fun and surprises!

One part of this movie that I love is when the chibettes try to bring a baby penguin back home to his family in the artic. He was so cute! (I'm a big animal lover)!

I also loved the part where that little dog pokes a hole in that guy's swimming float and he starts flying through the pool.

The songs in this movie are terrific and the chipmunks are very funny! (poor theodore, he's always hungry, but can never find the time to eat on the balloon trip). And of course, there's practical Simon: ""Uh, Alvin, land the balloon by the fountain (crash).....like I said....in the tree."" And of course, there's Alvin, the troublemaking chipmunk!

My sisters and Mom and I think Ms. Miller is hilarious in this movie, and we love the chipmunks! It's a classic that the whole family will enjoy!",1122508800,,1193,4.3558558558558556

47493,5,0783222726,"The Chipmunk Adventure is still one of my all-time fav animated movies, ranking above most of even Disney's best from the 80s and early 90s (it's a shame it only did a disappointing $6 mil. at the domestic box office).

The animation is beautiful, the story never gets old for me, and the music...well, it should come as no surprise that I also own the soundtrack on CD. I think this movie still stands the test of time, and if you have young children today they'd enjoy this as much as I did at that age. My only warning is that if you think you couldn't stand hearing your kids' high-pitched versions of ""Wooly Bully"" for the next few months, then don't dare bring this into your home. (But if you are the type to sing along...)

But I digress. I don't want to give away any of the story, but generally, the chipmunks & chipettes enter into a bet to race around the world for $100K. Of course, Dave would never allow this, and the scheme to keep him (and babysitting Mrs. Miller) unaware is almost as much of an adventure as the race itself.

I won't ruin anything for those who haven't seen it, but suffice it to say, there is something the youngsters don't know about the race that will end up getting everyone in deep trouble before the movie ends.

It's exciting, funny, beautifully animated and like I said, if you can walk away w/o humming even one of the tunes, I'd be surprised.

Definitely a great kids movie, as well as for those of us w/ a serious case of 80s nostalgia!

One Final Note:

Obviously, this movie has been one of my favorites since childhood, and I--like many others, if you read the reviews here, alone--have been patiently waiting for it to come to dvd. I read somewhere--over a year ago--that it was slated to arrive in March of 2004, but was pushed back...evidently indefinitely. I'd love to see the Chipmunk Adventure on disc, and if you feel likewise, I'd suggest going to the official website ([...] & then the ""contact us"" link) to inquire about it; if BAGDASARIAN PRODUCTIONS LLC sees a notable increase in interest for the DVD version, perhaps we'll see it on Amazon.com quicker?? Until then, I guess the VHS will have to suffice...",1112400000,6,2169,4.48984771573604
47494,5,0783222726,"I've loved this movie since I was a child.  If I had to get rid of every movie I watched as a kid and could only keep one, this is definitely the one I would keep.

Dave is going on a business trip to Europe, leaving the boys with Miss Miller.  Then, the Chipmunks and the Chippettes meet two people who offer to let them race around the world for a prize of one-hundred-thousand dollars, not knowing that it's just a scam to get them to deliver diamonds to people.  Running into all kinds of trouble, and singing a bunch of great songs, this movie is one of the best cartoons ever!  The scene where the boys sing ""Woolie Bully"" is even more classic than Pee-Wee dancing to ""Tequila"".  If you or your kids have never seen this movie, you don't know what you're missing!

They go all over the world on a huge and dangerous race, all the while evading two captors who are out to get them.  There is a classic Chipmunks verses the Chipettes dance/sing off.

47508,5,0783222726,"Ahhhh, Alvin and the Chipmunks. An enigma even in the cartoon world. Alvin and his mutant brothers attend school, speak English, play on the basketball team, and record albums, and nobody thinks it strange. Except for their female counterparts, the Chipettes, all the other animals in the world act like plain old animals, suggesting that -- you got it -- they are actually ALIENS! FREAKS OF NATURE! AN EXPERIMENT GONE HORRIBLY WRONG! Or just the overactive imagination of a recording artist. You have to use a little ""suspension of belief,"" similar to watching a Jackie Chan movie. But this movie embraces these out-of-place, oversized rodents and makes them quite endearing!
As another reviewer pointed out, the movie looks LOADS better than the TV show. I watched the credits to see if there were Asian artists involved; while Alvin and pals don't look like standard big-eyed anime, they certainly don't resemble most of your usual American fare. (Actually the names were mostly American, with Asians turning up primarily in the background art. Who knew? Also a bit of trivia-- there is a category in the credits called ""Chipmunk Masseuse""!) All the chip-folk look great. And all the humans look... well, quite realistic!
I have to wonder if the Chipmunks and Chipettes ever thought it was strange how similar they are. There are the tall, smart, thin, blue-wearing ones, the popular, average-sized, red/pink-wearing ones, and the short, chubby, scatter-brained green-wearing ones. Guys and their ""feminine sides"" ? A psychologist would have an interesting assignment diagnosing these guys!
The songs are what make this movie. We're not talking West Side Story here, but wow! Catchy songs that add spice and pacing to the movie. The main title is orchestrated and the credits list the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra!
Now some of you might be thinking, ""Wait a minute, the chipmunks have the most annoying voices known to man, and you're telling me these songs are good?"" Believe me, I hear you. But somehow, SOMEHOW, it does work! With the EXCEPTION of the Mexican song sung by the Chipmunks (Alvin's laugh at the end is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me!) the songs blend nicely. As a matter of fact, if I ever saw the soundtrack in the bargain bin, I'd pick it up!
Can I say something else, frankly? I don't know how old the Chips are supposed to be. I remember watching the cartoon and thinking they were supposed to be somewhere around 12 (human) years old. And appropriately, there is a little (just a little, mind you) sexual tension between the Chips and the Ettes. This movie could be the usual boys vs. girls plot but it goes deeper than that. They spend most of the movie arguing over ""who is the best,"" with their dispute elevating into a mutual song, ""Boys/Girls of Rock'n'Roll"" where they end up dancing together at the Parthenon. Disagree with me if you want, but there is chipmunk love in the air -- and I say, hurrah! For all us ""Rescue Rangers"" watchers who were just waiting for Chip and Gadget to get it on, this one's for you!
There are some really funny moments in this movie, including everyone's favorite, an event which has come to be known as ""The Miss Miller Deception."" My sister used to do an impression of the Chipmunk's tape which had us on the floor with laughter. ""DAAVID! ARE YOU DRUNK?"" (Another bit of trivia-- listen closely to the child sultan... yes, it's Bart Simpson {Nancy Cartwright} in an early performance!) The villians are snotty Europeans, a Cruella DeVille and her designer-sock-loving brother. And the pint-size spoiled pooch. You gotta love 'em.
This is a well-done movie, with just a few slow spots -- for example, the shark attack scene could have been left out, in my opinion. But the plot is very good, (especially for a children's movie) and I hope a DVD release will be in order. I look forward to sharing this movie with my little Chipette, who is only 11 months old right now, but will appreciate it some day!",1033603200,,3973,4.809941520467836

The animation is of very fine quality and the plot is just marvelous. Infact, I think that this movie is what originally started my love of travel...the culture, the skylines, the adventure...*sigh*. The Chipmunks and Chipettes are my heroes! Not seeing this movie at some time in your life would be a great tradgedy indeed.",1001635200,4,1152,4.543269230769231

This movie takes you all over the world and contains humor, GREAT songs, and some adorable characters.  It has some lessons for the younger children and remind older viewers of the same lessons.

I would always watch this movie when it came on television...it glued me to the screen and I would not move until it was over. There is just a magic in this movie that sets the kid spirit wild. The songs are wonderfully done and visually stimulating. The kids will absolutely adore this movie and the parents will enjoy watching it as well (I know my mom did). Let's put it this way, I am 21 and still watch it everytime I get a chance.",986256000,,500,4.1020408163265305
