8146866,3,B000ION26M,"The Bomba series was a low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of the various Tarzan series. Here we have Boy, Johnny Sheffield, grown up in his late teens as the ape man. These jungle movies are basically all the same, but they are usually entertaining in spite of themselves.

A hunter and his family are living in the jungle while the father traps wild beasts for sale. His young son makes friends with Bomba, who his parents believe is just a legend and a figment of Davids imagination. Bomba wants to stay hidden; he knows how dangerous white men can be. But he does not approve of his young friends father. When two more men arrive and trick young David into telling them where he and Bomba found daggers made with gold, emeralds, and rubies, the family has to work with Bomba to get the boy back.

The women have little to do besides look beautiful, although of the two women, Elena Verdugo makes a good impression as a wiser-than-usual native nanny. The relationship between Bomba and David seems questionable to modern eyes, especially when David insists on dressing in a loincloth like Bomba because you cant swing on vines in clothes and shoes, but it is depicted as innocent. There are lots of laughable encounters with animals, such as a familiar scene where Bomba fights a crocodile in the water ala Tarzan, or a vicious slow-moving python who surprises his victim in spite of his crawling gait.",1433721600,,1414,4.652

8146869,3,B000ION26M,"""The Lost Volcano"" was made in 1950 and was the third entry
in a long series of Bomba, the Jungle Boy feature films which
comprised 12 features. Unfortunately, ""The Lost Volcano"" is
the only Bomba feature currently available on DVD.

It has been said that the quality of this DVD is very poor,
a statement that I would not entirely agree with.  Without
getting too technical, the picture quality is certainly not
of high definition standard but it is none the less most
acceptable to watch whilst the audio is clear and robust.
I was in no way disappointed with the disc and the delivery
service by AAE Films/Allied Artists was prompt and efficient.

The story told concerns Bomba (Johnny Sheffield) and his
friendship with a young boy named David Gordon (Tommy Ivo).
Both meet regularly in the jungle where Bomba teaches the boy
jungle ways and takes him to places that most people have
never seen. One such trip was to an ancient and abandoned
village inside a volcano. Whilst there, young David picked up
a small relic which he believed was not of any value and
took it home with him. At home, he had occasion to show the
relic to two hunters who were visiting his parents and they
discovered that it was made of pure gold and was very
valuable.

The two hunters immediately hatch plans to find this village
and use David as a guide. Because of his loyalty to Bomba,
David refuses and so the hunters kidnap David and force him
to lead them to the treasure.

This prompts Bomba to save his young friend and so the chase
begins, ending up inside the volcano as it begins to erupt.

The first half of the movie is slowly paced with little
action but that picks up towards the end when they enter the
volcano and it erupts in spectacular fashion.

Although ""The Lost Volcano"" is entertaining, it certainly
is no classic.

Prior to starting the Bomba series, Johnny Sheffield had
lost the boyish appeal that he had displayed in the Tarzan
films and his performances then became somewhat
uninspiring.",1347667200,,1997,4.605633802816901
8146870,3,B000ION26M,"In 1949, film makers saw the popularity of the Tarzan movies and saw that Johnny Sheffield had performed well as the adopted son of Tarzan, called Boy. They realized that they could make money on low budget take offs staring Sheffield, now 18 years old, as a boy who, like Tarzan lived in the jungle. This film is the first of a dozen movies starring Sheffield as Bomba. It is based on a book Bomba, the Jungle Boy.

 A father and daughter are photographers filming animals in the jungle. The daughter is out one day with a guide when a lion kills the guide. Bomba, who walks around with a spear in most of the film, spears the lion and saves the girl. She is afraid of him, runs off and gets lost. He saves her, takes her to his home, and shows her the animals that are his friends. He wants here to remain with him. The girl's father also gets into trouble trying to find her, and Bomba helps him.

Bomba speaks English badly, just as Johnny Weissmuller did as Tarzan. He says that he learnt to speak the language by a man who came to the jungle, hated humanity, and advised Bomba to stay away from people.",1321833600,,1108,4.266666666666667
8146871,1,B000ION26M,"The fact that this is a DVD-R means very little.
I'm not the type that complains simply because a disc is DVD-R instead of a 'pressed' disc. Many films would never be available at all if we had to wait for pressed editions. DVD-Rs allow many publishers to offer deep-library titles in small quantites, to collectors and film buffs (like me).

Some publishers (such as Warner Archive, Sinister Cinema, etc.) offer excellent quality DVD-Rs, and I am happy to own, and watch, many from those particular sources.

...However, This disc does NOT fall into that category. The quality of the source print used for ""The Lost Volcano"" is very, very poor. Any publisher worth a darn could have found a better print to use-- but not these folks.

I have a VHS-cassette of this 'Bomba' film that I copied from cable-TV back in the late 1990's.
That VHS copy of mine is miles ahead of this in clarity, resolution, and overall ""watch-ability""....

This appears to be a copy of a copy of a copy (..you get the point) of a bad copy tape.
The resolution is so bad that you can actually count the pixel-lines on your TV screen. I doubt this is even a 300-(horizontal) line copy
Focus is inexcusably soft; --there are no bold blacks or whites, and the grays have no definition, at all.

If I transferred my own VHS-cassette to a disc, I would have a DVD-R of this film that would be infinitely better than this.

I paid my $29.95 + $2.98 shipping because I thought I was going to get a studio mastered print of this film; --their 'talk' in their Amazon listing leads you to believe that this outfit actually IS Allied Artists, and they have the original AA prints.
...Not so.
 These folks have given themselves a similar name, that's all.
...and their 'library' is suspect, at best.

I just wish I had known that BEFORE I shelled out $29.95 for this.

I'm stuck with this disc.

Don't you get stuck.

You've been warned!

8146872,3,B000ION26M,"""The Lost Volcano"" is a good, black & white 1950 adventure film for the ""Bomba"" series that allowed Johnny Sheffield to reinvorate the ""Tarzan"" series after it timed out.

Paul Gordon (Donald Woods) leads safaris in the jungles of Africa, often capturing animals.  Bomba, while disdaining Paul, has taken up a secret friendship with his younger-teen son, David (Tommy Ivo), teaching David the vines.  An archaelogist from the Cairo Museum shows up with two helpers to ask Paul Gordon to lead an expedition to a lost volcano which has buried an ancient civilization under lava and ash.  When it turns out that David has a jeweled, golden knife from the civiliation, gained from an earlier visit with Bomba, the two helpers snatch David to get the treasure for themselves.  Bomba and the others chase after.  Complicating the matter is that the local volcano stages a big eruption, catching all the characters.  The series continues; so you can guess how it ends.

The Allied Artists (Monogram) DVD case says the movie lasts 67 minutes, but I timed it out at 75.5 minutes.  There are no extras or even any chapters.  The picture has not been restored.  While, the action is clear enough, there are enough artifacts, overly whitened areas, and lack of detail to make the lack of restoration noticable.  The sound is good.  There are no extras.  As expected, there are no language, sex, or drug problems.  The violence is shooting, mild tussling, and crocodile and python attacks.  Bomba and (usually) David wear loincloths; the Gordon's housekeeper Nona (Elena Verdugo) wears a sarong.  The DVD cover has a volcano and Bomba on the front, but the back has a rhinoceros not in the film, while the spine shows Johnny Sheffield as a young ""Boy"" from the ""Tarzan"" movie series.

Restoration does cost money.  Having the studios digitize existing film stock preserves a record before the film disintegrates or burns.  This is a good thing.  Will circumstances allow a restoration and re-issue, not only for the ""Bomba"" series but for so many other old films?  Let's hope so.

The movie is reasonably entertaining, with a poor picture quality and no extras, but with good stock footage.  I rate this version a low 3.",1262649600,15,2207,4.870967741935484
8146873,3,B000ION26M,"Young Johnny Sheffield played ""Boy"" in seven Tarzan films, then moved on after nine years to do a dozen jungle-set Bomba features. Except for a handful of early appearances, Sheffield spent his entire cinematic career acting in African adventure stories.

THE LOST VOLCANO was directed by action serial specialist Ford Beebe. Also in the cast are Elena Verdugo (Consuelo Lopez on the 1970s TV drama, ""Marcus Welby, M.D"") and Marjorie Lord (second wife to Danny Thomas on the ""Make Room For Daddy"" sitcom).

SYNOPSIS for ""The Lost Volcano""--
