8334270,4,B001PQDLS6,"En mand kommer hjem is the story of Sebastian who believes his father died on the railway soon gets a shock when he meets a world famous opera singer returning to his hometown. This is a comical love story and quite amusing with Sebastian and his stutter which eventaully disappears. Particularly impressive was Oliver Mller-Knauer who, surprisingly, has done no other work in Danish film or TV, considering the fact that most other Danish actors regularly revolve around various TV, films and theatre productions. Viewers of recent Danish TV acquisitions here will recognise Nicolaj Kopernikus in a small role in the film. Kopernikus played Vagn in The Killing and also appeared in The Bridge.
There are better Danish films out there than this, but this is definitely worth a watch, even if it just proves that Denmark isn't as dark and grim as depicted in The Killing. This film makes it appear that Denmark is light and summery all year round.
The film is in Danish with English subtitles.",1357516800,,992,4.875739644970414
