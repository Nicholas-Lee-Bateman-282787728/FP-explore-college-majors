8325335,5,B000KRMZQA,"A|s a child of 8 I was sent to a small boarding school, no day girls !  We didn't learn anything much but we certainly lived the life of St Trinians and the books were considered essential reading and provided a source of what we could get up to next, ie smoking and drinking.  St Custards also provided fodder for those of us who considered the opposite sex an essential part of life.  Unfortunately, we were barred from having such contacts but every effort was made to do so - use your imagination !  Great films with great memories of a very happy and naughty school life.",1329177600,2,576,4.355140186915888
8325336,4,B000KRMZQA,I am just getting together all the dvds / cds of movies and songs that I appreciated when I was a lot younger and found I still love the St Trinians girls.,1314144000,2,155,3.875
8325337,4,B000KRMZQA,I really like the St. Trinians movies and this doesn't disappoint. It's dark humor at it's best.,1282435200,3,96,4.705882352941177
8325338,5,B000KRMZQA,"The original St Trinians films are exceptionally well written and cleverly acted out, mocking the accepted style for romantic drama of the day. The new St Trinians film should be given a very wide berth. It just doesn't have that flair of the originals. The music is too hip, and trying to have a trendy story line....completely misses the point and harmless fun of the earlier films, which were intended as spoofs. the music should be haphazard and broken down, much like that of a poorly executed school recital. The old honky tonk, poorly tuned piano and band( especially the drum) just can't be improved upon. I was very disappointed with the modern remake! Originals should never be tampered with!!!!!",1228089600,,706,4.891666666666667
8325339,3,B000KRMZQA,"This is better than 3 stars for me (though not quite 4), and generally maintains the standard set by the previous two films. At the start of the film the school has been burnt down and the pupils are brought to trial. A lovely sequence follows in which the Judge is continually distracted by one of the rather good-looking 6th formers! Because of this and thanks to a scam devised by Flash Harry (George Cole) the pupils are basically let off. Sadly the film doesn't quite maintain the standard of comedy set in this opening section.

The cast is mostly good with John LeMesurier turning up as the Minister of Education and Sid James as the backer of the new school (to be built). Irene Handl, Dennis Price and of course Joyce Grenfell also feature, along with a large cast of schoolgirls. The recurring joke through the film is the numerous people who put on some relaxing music and dance to it to relieve the stress of trying to deal with St Trinians problems. This is quite surreal and almost Pythonesq.

This is well worth buying (unlike the final film in the series), and can be purchased as part of a 4 disc set, which is also strongly recommended.",1202342400,5,1154,4.516746411483253
8325340,1,B000KRMZQA,Save your money; stupid movie; even the usually great Joyce Grenfell couldn't save this one.  Boring.,1198800000,2,101,5.3125
8325341,5,B000KRMZQA,"As an ""Old Girl"" from a not-quite-so-similar school, back in the good old days of Gym Slips, White Blouses and Black wool stockings, I must admit that we were always up to something... we were not quite that outrageous...but, in a way I am sure that our Head thought we were. Though the entire cast of this film is extraordinarily exagerated...they all bring a faint sprinkle of reality and a giggle of happy memories..Long Live St. Trinians!!",1123804800,,443,4.766233766233766
