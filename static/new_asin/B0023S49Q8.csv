8349826,3,B0023S49Q8,"This apparently ran for a long time in GB - I am an English ex-pat and am always sceptical of longterm detective TV series in the UK - they tend to be something to view on the ""telly,"" and the episodes appear to eventually run together. This is okay, but I would not spend time and money on buying the whole set !! Taggart the detective is lukewarm and the acting, although up to BBC standards, does not invite undivided attention - somewhat boring in parts !! Sorry but not thrilled !!",1363564800,,486,4.293478260869565
