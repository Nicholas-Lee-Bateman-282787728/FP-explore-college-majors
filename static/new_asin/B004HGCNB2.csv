Low budget but good music and decently done.",1471478400,,104,4.777777777777778

8429507,1,B004HGCNB2,"This movie was the worse 11.67 that I have ever spent.  It is a low budget movie, Poor acting, boring and absolutely NO plot whatsoever!  It centers around a ""so-called"" Beat Master who is supposely comprising the ""Dopest"" beats at their so called Battles at various clubs.  In the movie you hear about 1 minute of the beat and then a winner is determined.  The title gives the illusion of a Step Dance Theme when in fact it has NOTHING to do with Stepping at all.  I was so disappointed that I fast forward in hopes some action was going to appear.  Whoever produced this movie needs a serious butt kicking and should be ashamed that they are duping consumers out of their money with false titles as ""Step Off""  This butthole probably doesn't even know the meaning of the term ""Step Off"".  I wasted 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back not to mention 11.67 on this piece of crap.  Run don't walk away from this one!!!",1302912000,,930,4.3604651162790695
