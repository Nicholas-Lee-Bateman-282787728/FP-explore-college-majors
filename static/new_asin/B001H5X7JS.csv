3622823,5,B001H5X7JS,"This movie is so funny you will...

--pee your pants.
--shoot soda out of your nose.
--choke on your tongue laughing.
--go to confession bc you laughed at retarded people.

It's risky, daring and oh, so graphic. Great camoes, too. Tom Cruise is freaking hilarious. Jack Black, as the struggling heroin addict is bloody brilliant. And let me just say that Robert Downey Jr. is a GENIUS! I've seen him in a lot of movies, but didn't realize the full extent of his talent until I saw this film.

It's not very Ben Stiller focused. surprisingly. But, IMHO, it is to the benefit of the film. What he is in is uber funny, though.

I hesitate to say this is a movie for the entire family (probably inappropriate for young kids), but I went with my husband, Mom and Dad and we were all ROLLING with laughter. We recapped all of the funny bits on the drive home.

Highly recommended.",1224288000,11,874,4.4375

3622825,5,B001H5X7JS,"OMG... this is so good. As a baby boomer I seldom watch any media about Vietnam. It is just too painful, but this hits just the right spoof quality. It is a COMEDY. A comedy that many won't like. That's okay. Those of us who like smart comedy will love this.  I had to look up the palyers to see how RDJ plays this. You won't recognize him... and his voice. Wow. Even Tom cruise is a cameo that has to be seen.

The special effects are over the top. as they should be.

Saying anything specific would be a spoiler. Watch it. I rented it first than had to buy it. So good.",1519171200,,571,3.991228070175439

3622829,5,B001H5X7JS,"So this movie is funny. But there is an even better gem with this. In the movie Robert Downey Jr says in his character ""I don't drop character till the DVD commentary"" true to his word he did the whole commentary till credits as his characters (yes 2 characters). This movie is a fun watch, a bit long for me. But with the commentary you can't go back to watching the other version. Besides rdj, you get some notes and behind the scenes with Ben and Jack and they were also funny too. Buy this version for the commentary.",1515715200,,521,4.2727272727272725

3622833,1,B001H5X7JS,This was the most disgusting movie ever. Nothing like the preview. I am disappointed in Ben Stiller for being a part of this TRASH.,1514937600,2,131,4.5

3622835,1,B001H5X7JS,"If you're wondering about the title I picked for my review, it's an actual line of ""hilarious"" dialogue from ""Tropic Thunder"". It's actually one of the better lines from this supremely odious film. I absolutely hated this movie, and what's worse, it's the second film with Robert Downey, Jr. that I've seen this week that I utterly detested (the other was ""The Singing Detective"", which I actually liked better). It's not his fault here; in fact, he's the best part of this one, turning in by far the best performance. Ben Stiller takes the annoyance prize for starring as a self-important actor caught in a war movie, and I am astonished how relentlessly unentertaining this film within a film is.

Although I received this as a gift, I read the DVD box and thought the concept had a lot of potential, but then I warily noted that it was partially written by, stars, and was directed by Ben Stiller. Stiller plays movie star Tugg Speedman, while Jack Black's considerable talents are wasted as Jeff Portnoy, a comic star famous for flatulence, and Robert Downey, Jr. appears as Kirk Lazarus, a black man...for some reason. That these characters are able be summed up so quickly (gassy or black for some reason) is about as far as the joke goes and reveals the underlying problem of this film: that's simply all there is to see here, and character and conflict seem to be mere afterthoughts to stupid visual gags or flatus. I'm not sure why they thought it'd be funny to have a white man star as black for instance, as it never furthers the plot and is merely an unwelcome distraction. The script is juvenile, there's lots of pointless gore, and profanity is a cheap crutch used as a substitute for actual humor. A water buffalo out-acts the remainder of the cast combined. Speaking of unfunny and over the top, watch for the unwelcome appearance of Tom Cruise as a dancing, profane agent in a fat suit. Side note: the DVD comes with lots of extras. I couldn't be bothered to watch most of them, but the time devoted to Tom Cruise as a mogul dancing to rap is especially painful. You have been warned.

I actually enjoy satire and spoofs when skillfully executed, but they're hard to pull off. The over budget war movie interfacing with actual combat has the potential to work, with a couple of huge qualifications. The first is that it's skillfully written, cast, and acted, so there is nuance, intelligence, and subtlety to the humor, the second and most important is that it's not referential to actual historical tragedies. I don't object to movies about Vietnam being made, not even ones that veer to pushing a political point as long as they're respectful. I served in the US Air Force, and personally know and served with a sizeable number of Vietnam veterans, and have to say the Vietnam experience is not one that immediately springs to mind as a source of inspiration for slapstick and satire. In that light, I found ""Tropic Thunder"" to be disrespectful of Vietnam veterans and in extremely poor taste. Beyond the comedy bonanza that is Vietnam, the movie is simply sophomoric at best. Although I actually did think the concept of a film cast and crew finding themselves enmeshed in an actual conflict had promise, I did not laugh once and was supremely tempted to just give up and throw it in the trash.

I found ""Tropic Thunder"" loathsome and tiresome. I could not recommend choosing another movie more.",1510876800,2,3415,4.707357859531773

Only question left to ask when will there be a part 2 since we got trump in office aka les Grossman which by the way Tom Cruise does some excellent acting in this movie cause some of the best Hollywood agents do act like that in real life. So if you enjoy a great laugh and want to see some stuff not even shown on cable tv this is the movie for you.

Id recommend this movie to anybody who having a bad day and just need to laugh once one while!

The opening was great- I laughed heartily at the fake movie reviews of the individual actors' past efforts (especially the one with Robert Downey Jr. and Toby McGuire, hilarious).  In a nutshell, what was best about this movie for me were the performances, the acting range evinced by all concerned, but especially Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black (even though Black was REALLY crude when playing his ""real"" self).  Downey Jr. was fascinating.  Ditto with Tom Cruise's CREEPY chairman of the board.  Hard to believe suave Cruise could be so... repellent.

If I tried to skip the previews, it would hang as well. I tried multiple times, even resetting my player with a hard reset, with no success, so I sent it back. The case did say it was region 1, which is what my player is, so I'm at a loss for what was wrong with the disc. I did not order a replacement so I can't say whether it was a single defective disc or indicative of a more pervasive problem.

I love Robert Downey, Jr.'s role as an Australia superstar method actor who becomes so wrapped up in his role that he really believes he's a black man, irritating the others and especially ticking off the only real black man in the cast.  Ben Stiller plays an air-headed egotistical star whose one claim to fame is wearing thin on audiences after too many predictable sequels of his action adventure series, and Jack Black is a hooked on drugs movie star of a series of movies that parody Eddy Murphy's Nutty Professor roles.  Tom Cruise's scenes as the foul-mouthed entertainment execute Les Grossman are priceless, and Matthew McConaughey is great as the shallow talent agent.",1456444800,,909,4.8076923076923075

This extended Director's Cut (120 minutes, 1 disc) features English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, French 5.1 Dolby Digital, and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, as well as two commentaries: a Filmmaker Commentary with Ben Stiller, Justin Theroux, Stuart Cornfeld, Jeff Mann, John Toll and Greg Hayden; and a Cast Commentary with Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. Available subtitles are English, English SDH, French, Spanish, and Portugese. As far as I can tell, the DC is the only version of the film currently available on R1 Blu-ray, though I'd prefer to own the theatrical cut as I've found the added scenes to be not particularly worthwhile.

There are plenty of extra features, including Before the Thunder, The Hot LZ, Blowing S*** Up, Designing the Thunder, The Cast of Tropic Thunder, Rain of Madness, Make-up Test with Tom Cruise, Deleted Scenes/Extended Sequences/Alternate Ending, Full Mags, MTV Movie Awards - Tropic Thunder, and BD-Live.

A group of actors are shooting an expensive action film on location when things continue go south. This film stars RDJ, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Jay Baruchel, Nick Nolte, Danny McBride, Matthew McConaughey, Brandon T Jackson, and an unrecognizable Tom Cruise.

This movie while hilarious, was also met with some controversy mostly because of RDJ's use of blackface. It was also met with controversy because of some of the language, mostly pertaining to Ben Stiller's characters most popular role of ""Simple Jack"" in which he played a mentally handicaped person.",1448236800,4,813,5.112781954887218

Lots of undertones and really fun to see a bunch of Hollywood elites and not so elites in a film that showcases the best and sometimes worse and a satirical view of the movie business from Ben Stillers eyes, which, I think he hoped to get more action adventure roles by producing and directing himself in this spoof of action/adventure films, but I think Meet the Fockers, is his wheelhouse.

Ben Stiller character in the movie played some kind of a retard in a movie at one time, and they keep bring it up over and over again as a running gag it's not funny either.

3623290,4,B001H5X7JS,"""Tropic Thunder,"" the big-screen Hollywood spoof of Hollywood war movies, Hollywood actors, Hollywood filmmakers, and Hollywood filmmaking, was one of the funnier comedies of 2008, the others being quite a bit different.  For instance, the remake of ""Get Smart"" was relatively gentle and reserved; the Coen brothers' ""Burn After Reading"" was irreverent and sarcastic; and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was salacious but intelligent.  ""Tropic Thunder,"" on the other hand, is wildly outrageous, vulgar, crude, and most often over-the-top.  In their own ways, though, all of these movies made me laugh, at least in part.  Go figure.

The premise of ""Tropic Thunder"" is one of those ""what if's.""  What if a group of goofus actors making a Vietnam war movie on location in Vietnam traveled to the interior of the country, had real enemies shooting at them, and didn't know it was all for real?  What if they thought it was just part of the film they were making?

When a movie company gets stuck and the producer threatens to pull the plug, the filmmakers decide to go for broke and shoot in the Vietnamese rain forests with hidden cameras.  Only in the middle of the jungle where they're shooting, they run into members of a genuine drug cartel who think the actors are DEA officers.  It all gets pretty silly pretty fast.

Ben Stiller co-wrote, co-produced, directed, and stars in the film.  I mean, you'd think it was a Ben Stiller film.  And you'd be right; his touch is everywhere.  Stiller plays a fading, Stallone-type actor, Tugg Speedman, who's starred in about 800 Rambo-like action movies, most of them sequels, and now desperately needs a hit or he sees his career going down the tubes.  His answer is a Vietnam saga, ""Tropic Thunder,"" in the mold of ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" and ""Full Metal Jacket.""

Stiller is funny, to be sure, but it's Robert Downey, Jr. who steals the show and upstages everybody.  He plays Kirk Lazarus, an Australian superstar method actor who takes every part he plays as the Second Coming.  Lazarus is clearly patterned on such meticulously finicky actors as Russell Crowe or Robert DeNiro.  Stiller says it was important to cast a real-life no-nonsense actor that audiences could take seriously if the satire was to work, and certainly Stiller found his man in Downey.  The guy is always the best part of any film he's in, and he's able to play heavyweight roles and comic ones with equal ease.  In ""Tropic Thunder"" Downey's Lazarus character accepts a part as a black man in the film within the film, and to do it up right Lazarus demands that he not use makeup but have his skin surgically dyed black.  Then he insists upon remaining in character at all times, actually beginning to think that he really is black.  ""I don't drop character until I done the DVD commentary.""  The result is hilarious, and Downey easily makes the movie worth watching.

The film's third major star is sort of the odd-man-out:  Jack Black.  Black's a funny guy, but his character, Jeff Portnoy, a gross, conceited, drug-addicted comic actor famous for fart jokes, never comes off as very funny; at least, not as funny as the others, perhaps because his character is the most overblown, exaggerated one of the lot.  He often simply comes across as crude for crudity's sake.

Among the film's other players are Brandon T. Jackson as Alpa Chino, a hip-hop artist gone Hollywood; Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky, a naive chatterbox who ventures into the fake film's very real jungle with the rest; Nick Nolte as Four Leaf Tayback, a tough, grizzled, handless Vietnam vet upon whose autobiographical book the filmmakers are basing the movie within the movie; Steve Coogan as Damien Cockburn, an effete British director of the movie; Danny McBride as Cody, the film crew's manic pyrotechnics expert; Matthew McConaughey as Rick Peck, Speedman's Tivo-obsessed agent; and Bill Hader as Rob Slolom, a studio toady.

Then, there is a major Hollywood superstar whose name does not appear in the keep-case credits.  By now everyone on the planet knows who it is, but for the sake of the two viewers who have been on the International Space Station these past few years, I won't mention it (even though it's listed in the extras below; sorry about that).  Anyway, even if you know who the superstar is, you probably won't recognize him under the hair and the lack thereof.  And he takes the part so earnestly, it's hard not to crack up just looking at him.

Nevertheless, there are several problems with ""Tropic Thunder"" that keep it from classic status, like never knowing when to quit, milking a gag too long, letting whole sequences go on too long, and interspersing brilliance with, literally, flatulence.  Illustrating the point are the pseudo trailers that open the movie, wherein each of the stars of the film within the film gets his own preview.  Two of the trailers, the ones for action hero Tugman and serious dramatic actor Lazarus are clever and witty and very, very funny; the two for hip-hop artist Chino and comic actor Portnoy are intentionally gross and distasteful.  These moments of ups and downs set the tone for the rest of the movie and make it hard to enjoy the good for the bad.

""Tropic Thunder"" has a little something in it to offend everyone.  Stiller isn't afraid to poke fun at the expense of the physically handicapped, the emotionally challenged, the disabled, blacks, even pandas.  For every big laugh, though, there's a groaner.  For every cute gag, there's one so coarse or tasteless, you have to shake your head.  It's a remarkably uneven film, yet when the laughs do come, they can be so sidesplitting or so surprising, they're worth the trouble of the clunkers.  You take what you can get.

Video:
As usual, you'll find an improvement over the standard-definition format in both the picture and the sound of the Blu-ray presentation.  DreamWorks offer the movie in its theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1 using a BD50, MPEG-4/AVC, 1080p transfer.  The image displays good color, with natural facial tones and fairly strong contrasts.  Black levels usually remain deep, setting off the hues nicely, although a few scenes look somewhat dark.  A light film grain is realistically present at all times.  The definition remains slightly soft in indoor scenes but razor sharp in most location shots.  Overall glossiness seems consistent with what I remember seeing in a movie theater.

Audio:
As befitting any real action movie, this satiric film's soundtrack delivers an abundance of surround activity, a wide frequency response, and plenty of punch.  More important, with the BD's Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sonics, everything is a tad bit smoother, wider, and more dynamic than in regular Dolby Digital.  During the opening sequences, the sound is intentionally exaggerated, but don't worry about it; it's part of the fun.  Bass is thunderously deep, and the musical background is pounding; like the rest of the audio, they are always at the service of the film's raunchy humor.

Extras:
The Blu-ray disc contains most, but not all, of the extras found in the standard-definition two-disc edition.  The first extra is a commentary with the filmmakers:  co-writer, co-producer, and director Ben Stiller, executive producer Justin Theroux, producer Stuart Cornfeld, production designer Jeff Mann, director of photography John Toll, and film editor Greg Hayden.  The second extra is also a commentary, this time a more amusing one with stars Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey, Jr.

The bonuses continue with ""Before the Thunder"" (HD), a five-minute section with Stiller, the producer, and others on preproduction stuff.  Next is ""The Hot LZ"" (HD), a six-minute bit on the location shooting for the film.  After that is ""Blowing S*** Up"" (HD), six minutes on the film's explosions, and then ""Designing the Thunder"" (HD), seven minutes on the sets.

After those relatively brief featurettes is a twenty-two-minute segment, ""The Cast of Tropic Thunder"" (HD), covering Stiller, Black, Downey, Jackson, Baruchel, McBride, and Nolte.  By the way, Downey says in his section that ""Ironman"" will be a trilogy, but it's hard to know if he's kidding or not.

Moving along, we get a mock documentary, ""Rain of Madness,"" a thirty-minute spoof of making-of docs, meant to send up films like ""Hearts of Darkness,"" the documentary on the making of ""Apocalypse Now.""  The ""Tropic Thunder"" documentary parody is pretty amusing, but it tends to overstay its welcome.

No collection of extras would be worth its salt if it didn't include a series of deleted and extended scenes, plus an alternate ending, so that's what comes up next:  Two deleted scenes, two extended scenes, and an alternative ending, all in high def, with optional introductions by Stiller and film editor Greg Hayden.

Finally, we get a minute-and-a-half ""Makeup Test with Tom Cruise""; a four-minute skit from the MTV Movie Awards with Stiller, Downey, and Black that is probably the funniest bonus item of all; and eleven minutes of raw film magazine footage (before editing) called ""Full Mags,"" also with an optional introduction.

Now, the oddity.  Usually, Blu-ray discs contain everything or close to everything found on their SD counterparts.  Not so here.  Instead, the viewer can only access several of the extras found on the SD set through BD-Live:  ""Dispatches from the Edge of Madness,"" twenty-three minutes of satiric comments on the making of the movie; three minutes of video rehearsals; and more ""Full Mags.""  If you don't have a Web-enabled Blu-ray player, you won't get them, which is hardly a selling point for the disc.

The Blu-ray disc lineup concludes with twenty-four scene selections; bookmarks; a guide to elapsed time; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
""Tropic Thunder"" is the closest thing you'll find to a Farrelly brothers comedy that doesn't involve the Farrelly brothers.  It's filled with the same zany, inflated, often gross, off-the-wall antics that so many of the Farrelly comedies contain, and just as with the Farrellys, you'll find as many or more misses as hits.  Still, when you throw enough gags at an audience, as this movie does, some of them are bound to work; meaning that you may find yourself laughing often enough to justify the time you spend with it.

Just be aware the film is not for everyone.  The original theatrical cut got a well-deserved R rating for profanity, crudeness, and violence, and this unrated Director's Cut with almost another quarter of an hour provides even more of the same.  The Wife-O-Meter lasted about ten minutes before she gave it up and left the room.  As I say, be advised.",1435190400,,10770,4.991591928251121

Jack Black plays a drugged out comedian famous for a series of comedies about fat people that fart a lot. Robert Downey Jr plays a blond Australian playing a black man. They're all supposedly in extremely unbelievable war movie that is running over budget and over schedule. The plot is convoluted and lacking in any real humor. I am not sure how Stiller can manage to screw up a role where he  is basically playing himself, but he does. Black also manages to turn in a crappy performance for a role that should have been very familiar to him by now. Downey Jr was just bizarre in this thing.

What was Ben Stiller thinking?  He made a comedy about actors making an action movie about Viet Nam.  Wow, thats gotta be a stretch.  Still stars in the film, along with Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. (in his second great performance of the year).  Stiller has credits for the original story and the screenplay both.  Stiller was one of the producers.  Stiller directed the movie.  You might say it was his movie.
 And it is funny!  This is his finest performance, not excepting Something About Mary.  The characters are trying to make a movie in Viet Nam about the war in Viet Nam.  The director is not a powerful enough personality to keep the self absorbed egos of the actors in check.  So, with the advise of author/Viet Nam vet Nick Nolte, the head for the deep bush.  Where they encounter vicious drug runners.
 It is an unlikely premise for a comedy, but Stiller and his band pull it off.  The crowd was laughing from the beginning-fake trailers introduced the fake actors in up coming fake movies, very funny stuff that we hadnt seen before.  The crowd was laughing when the movie ended. For a movie to begin and finish with laughter is all that we need and more than we usually expect.
 Along with Nick Nolte, Tom Cruse and Matthew McConaughey have strong supporting roles.  How cool is that, to have three first rate actors, all leading men, playing in the supporting cast?
 This is a very properly R rated movie.  There is plenty of slapstick violence.
There is also a lot of very adult language and very adult situations and references.  Youngsters will want to see this, but they should not.  Three and a half saw blades for Ben Stillers comedic triumph.",1427068800,,1685,4.5993265993265995

The writing gives them a lot to do and they just go for it. Generally stupid comedy is not my cup of tea, but I have seen this movie many times and it never gets old.

As for the controversy about Downey in blackface, I think that is a non-story. It's part of what makes it all funny. You have to see it to know what I mean. Go for it. It's a riot.",1425081600,,639,3.877862595419847

The story is about a group of actors with prima donna attitudes who were making a fictional Vietnam War movie that were taken in the middle of the jungle. Many of jokes aren't really funny considering that they are over the top and grossly offensive. But still,it is a movie that is easy to enjoy due to great acting especially by Robert Downey and Tom Cruise. Added to that,it did well on picking on what goes on in Hollywood and provided great allusion to great war epic films like The Bridge Of The River Kwai,Platoon and Rambo.",1411430400,,618,4.576576576576577

3623620,5,B001H5X7JS,"I think sometimes people use words like ""hilarious"" too often in movie reviews, but this time, for real, this movie is actually hilarious. Some of the laughs go for the obvious, like Jack Black's character being a one-note fart-joke comedian who does enough blow to kill a camel, and yes, it does play upon stereotypes to make a point--like the infamous ""full throttle r-word"" that Ben Stiller's character does so cringe-inducingly broadly, or Robert Downey Jr.'s blaxpoitation-style African-American soldier (who clashes beautifully with Brandon T. Jackson's rapper character; old meets new, stereotype meets reality, and racism gets its comeuppance at the hands of privilege awareness). RDJ steals every single scene he's in, but that's kind of the point of his character, so it's okay.

The story is about the making of a Vietnam-era war movie, as performed by actors who have no idea what Vietnam was even about. The bizarre inner workings of the movie industry are exposed here as accurately as you'll find in earlier masterpieces like ""Bowfinger""--and include an absolutely fascinating and riveting cameo by Tom Cruise himself as a profane, vile, soulless producer who just wants results (don't miss his scene during/after the credits!), and Steve Coogan as an incompetent director who is in way over his head. Rounding out the cast, Nick Nolte is a bitter Vietnam vet who is not what he seems, and Jay Baruchel is a rising young star dwarfed by the fame of his co-stars--and the lone voice of sanity in the whole pack of asylum escapees.

Matthew McConaughey does an equally brilliant cameo as the hero's chirpy, true-blue agent, reminding us that he can actually act--and act well!--if you give him half a chance; his character's story arc and development is one of the movie's strongest points. I also loved Robert Downey Jr. in this; he fulfills the same function here that Alan Rickman's vastly over-qualified Alexander Dane character did in ""Galaxy Quest""--as a truly talented foil to Ben Stiller's gimmicky action hero.

The story is well-paced with few misfires; I've never seen any other releases of this movie, so can't speak to how much better or worse it is than other versions, but can say that it generally accomplishes what it sets out to accomplish. The effects and everything else were well-done too, and the rest of the casting is simply superb. Overall, this movie is pitch-perfect.

People who liked ""Bowfinger,"" ""Stripes,"" ""Zoolander,"" and ""Galaxy Quest"" will enjoy this one very much. It does include some violence and frequent profanity, along with certain words/phrases which would probably be thought unacceptable by some folks, and frequent references to drugs and alcohol abuse. People who offend easily should probably not watch this movie and I don't think it's suitable for those below the age of 17 or so.",1395446400,5,2842,5.092274678111588

And, you can't beat Robert Downey in his role, playing an Aussie playing an African American.  How clever is that?  And, I don't think anybody could have pulled it off like RDJ.  He is just THE BEST!! . . . and deserved to win the Academy Award (even though he didn't).  It won't be long before he pulls in the Oscar that he's deserved for so long.

3623679,1,B001H5X7JS,"I purchased this movie solely for Tom Cruise's contribution.  I assumed that if Tom Cruise would be caught dead in this Ben Stiller-ish garbage there must be something tangentially worthy about it - WRONG!!!  If you are a fan of good cinema and a Tom Cruise believer, steer clear of this extremely stupid embarrassment of a movie.  However, if you're a Ben Stiller fan, by all means, purchase multiple copies and enjoy.  Just when you thought Ben Stiller couldn't possibly out-do himself in the stupid cinema genre you'll be left unbelieving of how he pulled off yet another masterpiece for the inane cinema effort.

If you're a member of the undead Zombie demographic, you too MIGHT find this slightly enjoyable, OR it might make you so angry as to prompt you to make Ben Stiller your newest recruit.  Would you want him as a recruit???

This movie has the distinction of being the first item I will ever Trade-In to Amazon.  Though the amount I'll receive is but a pittance, it's more than I'll receive by throwing it away, which was the consensus favorite before inquiring into the Trade-In option.",1382832000,,1101,4.757894736842105

3623684,4,B001H5X7JS,"Simply put, this is a silly movie in an enjoyable kind of way, that is fun, often funny, sometimes crude, but with an amazing opening and some of the best lines throughout the entire movie.

The opening, actually the first twenty minutes of the movie is top notch comedy. You get everything need to know, and wrapped in an ultra-funny way. You get an on-set filming of a Vietnam war movie, actor clashes, big egos and pettiness, mistimed special effects explosions, director losing control and desperate to regain it, and a movie mogul with a power trip.

Desperate circumstances (movie is way behind in production and actors aren't doing their job) call for desperate measures. The nice little movie set is cashed in for a dirty, gritty guerrilla-style film project, that of course is not well planned. And all of this is amazingly funny and happens in the first twenty minutes. Great lines, funny delivery.

The rest of the movie, though the plot is basic, is carried by some great comedy one liners, mostly delivered by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. Both of these two carry the movie after the first twenty minutes to the end of the film.
Here are just a few examples:

Tom Cruise: ""You kick down the door to my house, wanting a TiVo scrap for your client, who was 3rd Runner-up for Sexiest Man Alive 1998, and ask if I'm serious.""

Tom Cruise: Your client is a white dwarf headed down a black hole. Let's face it, the kids aren't dressing up like him for Purim anymore.""

There are plenty of others.

If you haven't seen it, and like Stiller's brand of comedy, check it out.

But this film destroyed that stereotype by upholding all of the precieved stereotypes about Hollywood.  Each cast member perfectly portrays a typical type of acting style, from Robert Downey Jr. and his method acting to Jack Black and his fart jokes to Ben Stiller playing the big-screen action star...all of them and more getting involved in a big-budget war film that becomes very real when a frustrated director abandons them in the woods in the hopes of getting some good shots (note that said directer blew himself up with a land mine, beginning the series of problemetic events that would plague the colorful bunch of actors.)

So I make no claim to represent the current movie-going, DVD buying generation. I found it to be amusing, no outright laughs, inevitable dead spots; overall, worth having watched although probably not one to lose sleep over missing. No need to repeat that the language is not that common among many Americans and that being offensive to various and sundry groups was deliberate and frequent. If these things bother you or the group with whom you will watch this on television, giving it a miss will not cut you off from anything you will be sorry for.

It's a great collection for your video library, and you can see it a hundred times and it won't get old. 4/5 stars.",1376092800,,454,3.881720430107527

However, things soon go wrong in the hands of an inexperienced director, and the actors find themselves in Vietnam-with real bad guys. Hilarious comedy ensues, and some of the jokes will have your stomach hurting from laughter. Robert Downey Jr. gives an excellent performance in this film, playing Australian actor Kirk Lazarus (who plays an African-American sergeant in the movie). He seriously could have won Best Supporting Actor, had the Dark Knight come out another year (RIP, Heath). Each character has their own quirks and funny moments, and some running jokes throughout the movie actually stay funny! All of the other actors in the movie give great performances as well, especially Tom Cruise and Nick Nolte. If you're easily offended, however, you probably won't like this film as much. It makes many jokes about sex, mental retardation (although more of the actors who portray mentally retarded people in their films), and racism. Nothing is super-offensive, however. In the end, this movie is great if you want to have a couple really funny  and entertaining hours. Hope this helped!",1376006400,,1242,5.058536585365854

As the days passed I never heard anyone raving about it so I sufficed with not seeing it.  Just recently I decided to watch and I am so glad I did.  I almost cried laughing.

I'm not a huge Stiller fan but I'll watch his movies.  I'm even less of a Jack Black fan but I won't go out of my way to avoid his movies.  And I had never even seen Robert Downey Jr. in a comedy.  I will say this:  Downey Jr. was classic, Stiller was good, and Black held his own.  Now for the X-Factor; the guy who didn't headline but was down right a riot nonetheless... Tom Cruise!!!  He was excellent in his small yet crucial role.  I never knew he could be so funny.

Listen... this movie no doubt pushes the envelope which is one of the reasons it's so funny.  The humor is not for everyone as they toe the line with a few taboo topics: racial humor, gay humor and even jokes at the expense of the mentally handicapped.  I felt guilty for laughing but they were just so funny.  I could go on and on about this movie but I will end with saying: just watch the movie.",1370908800,3,1160,3.982608695652174

3623762,5,B001H5X7JS,"""Tropic Thunder"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A group of self-absorbed actors set out to make the most expensive war film. But after ballooning costs force the studio to cancel the movie, the frustrated director refuses to stop shooting, leading his cast into the jungles of Southeast Asia, where they encounter real bad guys.

The cast led by Ben Stiller (who also wrote, produced and directed) (as Tugg Speedman), Jack Black (as Jeff Portnoy), and Robert Downey, Jr. (excellent as usual as Kirk Lazarus), and also Matthew McConaughey (as Peck) and Tom Cruise (in an unusual and excellent performance as Les Grossman) is excellent!

The directing by Stiller (who also starred, directed and produced and wrote the story and screenplay to ""Zoolander"" (2001, as Derek Zoolander), is excellent! The story by Stiller and Justin Theroux (who's known for his roles in ""American Psycho"" (2000) & ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001) is excellent! The screenplay by Stiller, Theroux, and Etan Cohen is excellent!

The music by Theodore Shapiro (who also did the music to the upcoming ""I Love You, Man"" (2009), ""Jennifer's Body"" (2009), ""Marley & Me"" (2008), he also did the music to ""Semi-Pro"" (2008), ""Blades Of Glory"" (2007, which Stiller produced), ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" (2004, which Stiller also starred and produced), ""Starsky & Hutch"" (2004, which Stiller also starred and executive produced), & ""Along Came Polly"" (2004, which Stiller also starred in) is excellent! The cinematography by John Toll (who also did the cinematography to ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007), ""The Last Samurai"" (2003, which Cruise also starred and produced), & ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001, which Cruise also starred and produced) is excellent! The film editing by Greg Hayden (who also did the film editing to ""Duplex"" (2003, which Stiller also starred and produced, and ""Zoolander"", he also did additional editing on ""Blades Of Glory"") is excellent! The casting by Francine Maisler (who also did the casting to the upcoming ""The Soloist"" (2008), ""Quantum Of Solace"" (2008), ""The Road"" (2008), & ""Milk"" (2008), she also did the casting to ""Hancock"" (2008) & ""21"" (2008) is excellent! The production design by Jeff Mann (who also did the production design to the upcoming ""The Surrogates"" (2009), he also did the production design to ""Transformers"" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Richard L. Johnson (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""State Of Play"" (2009), he also did the art direction to ""The Golden Compass"" (2007, supervising art director), ""World Trade Center (2006), & ""Born On The Fourth Of July (1989, which Cruise starred in) & Dan Webster (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""The Surrogates"" (supervising art director) is excellent! The set decoration by Daniel B. Clancy (who also did the set decoration to ""Fred Claus"" (2007), ""1408"" (2007), & ""The Number 23"" (2007) is excellent! The costume design by Marlene Stewart (who also did the costume design, recently, to ""Stop-Loss"" (2008) is excellent!

I was told by a bunch of people that this movie was great, so I went against my better judgment and rented it. After about an hour, we turned it off. I recognize the attempted satire and over-the-top intent of the movie, but the movie just isn't funny. It had potential but it just drags on and on and never really gets anywhere.

There were a few funny scenes but it took forever to develop, and so much of this movie could have been cut out. I give major credit to Robert Downey Jr; he tries his best to save this movie from itself, but even he has trouble with it. The only other notable acting was Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise who did well playing their roles, but those roles were mediocre; and Brandon T. Jackson who played the actual black soldier had some good moments with RDJ.

Overall, this is typical Ben Stiller. If you like his brand of comedy (outside of Something About Mary...his only real gem IMO), you might like it. But if you have been bored with other Ben Stiller movies like Zoolander...you will be bored with this one too.",1346025600,,1145,4.5

Many reviewers have already addressed the movie in great detail, however, I'll just add my two cents about the theatrical vs. director's cut versions.  I personally much prefer the director's cut, but either version is great.  I just think the extra scenes (13 minutes worth) add several more funny moments.  Just be careful when you order the DVD to check the run time on whatever version you purchase, as the director's cut is around 120 minutes, and the theater version around 107 minutes. (Sometimes they use the reviews interchangeably, so you can't always go by the comments.) That way you will end up with the version you choose.",1343952000,,1007,4.764367816091954
3623941,5,B001H5X7JS,"Tropic Thunder shipped swiftly through an Amazon reseller, and is the silliest motion picture I have yet viewed.  Thus, a 5-stars accomplishment of Ben Stiller and crew.

Please note that The Set-Up (1949):

""This riveting, gut-punching boxing picture plays out in something close to ""real time."" We are locked in with an over-the-hill pug (Robert Ryan) as he arrives at an arena for a match against a younger opponent. What he doesn't know yet is that his crooked manager has agreed to throw the fight for some gangsters--so Ryan has more than one battle on his hands as each bruising round goes by. At a lean, mean 72 minutes, The Set-Up manages to load the essential film noir themes into one potent package, excitingly delivered with no breathing room. Director Robert Wise would go on to make such mega-productions as The Sound of Music, which only makes you appreciate his economy here. And the movie's a fine showcase for tall, craggy Robert Ryan, one of the great under-sung actors in American movies, who was a boxer himself before becoming an actor. --Robert Horton
[Amazon review]

is regarded by many as the finest film to date.

Thus, The Set-Up, Tropic Thunder, some three hours viewing over an evening, bracketing the film expererience.

Stiller, Jack Black and a blackface-wearing Robert Downey Jr. share the center of the stage as hopelessly detached superstar actors who are unceremoniously dumped into the bush but still believe they're on the set. Each gets their homerun lines and the primary story is lots of fun, but the real stars are the unchained phony movie trailers, advertisements and celebrity cameos that speckle the picture. Tom Cruise in particular is a major scene stealer as the hairy, chunky, balding movie exec with no filter - every single one of his all-too-brief appearances left me aching with laughter and yearning for more. Who knew he had such an intensely funny side? It's among the rare breed of comedies that never stops being hilarious, even for a little while, and one of the most unabashedly funny films I've seen in a long time.",1332720000,,981,4.987804878048781

From the opening fake commercials and movie trailers to the entire script, casting and total laughfest (if you know your Apocalypse Now and Platoon scenes, you're in for a treat), Stiller proves that given total control he can do the job.

The DVD extras are classic as Robert Downey, Jr., stays in character on the commentary track.

3623982,3,B001H5X7JS,"A lot of people thought this was a great film, I thought it was so-so. The screenplay is very clever the way it makes fun of Hollywood while bringing all of its plot elements full circle, including Ben Stiller's heart-warming flop about a mentally challenged man called ""Simple Jack"". Every actor is merely being unoriginal by aping something in Hollywood (""Simple Jack"" makes fun of Sean Penn's ""I Am Sam"", for example, while Ben Stiller otherwise apes Bruce Willis, Robert Downey Jr parodies Russel Crowe, Jack Black tastelessly mimics Chris Farley, etc). Probably the most enjoyable actor is Brandon T Jackson, someone I only know from that awful Percy Jackson film; as the only black actor in the movie, the scenes where he makes fun of Robert Downey Jr's fakeness as an Australian actor with an American accent pretending to be a black man are pretty hilarious.

Tom Cruise has been lauded for playing Les Grossman, a truly evil studio executive. I'm not as impressed, since the idea of seeing a scabby fat suit and balding man make-up applied to the toned abs and creamy complexion of Jedi Master Cruise billows waaaaaay beyond irony and well into stupidity (his hairy fat hands are particularly icky). In his delivery Cruise is just imitating Samuel Jackson, Al Pacino and Harvey Keitel in a terribly unbelievable way, and with his fat suit how different is he from Martin Lawrence in Big Mama's House, Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor, John Travolta in Hairspray, or AC/DC's Rosie prop? Les Grossman - so what. Apparently he's going to get his own movie. Great, more fat suits in feature films...

Of course, the fake trailers are what keeps everybody talking about the film, and they're pretty okay, although they're nowhere near as good as those in Grindhouse (Don't, don't don't don't DON'T!). ""Satan's Alley"" is so-so, as it reunites Robert Downey Jr and Tobey Maguire for a re-hash of their gay scenes in The Wonder Boys. The movie also has quite a few funny things about it, such as the way they created a website for the energy drink that the rapper character Alpa-China (played by Jackson - love the name) flogs called Booty Sweat. Hit the link and try the Booty Sweat challenge, man! Also check out his great site.  The Tropic Thunder site is pretty good too.

From the spoof adverts and film trailers at the start of this film you know what you're letting yourself in for and the film continues in much the same vein. This is a spoof Vietnam film about the filming of a Vietnam film and it borrows very heavily from Platoon, as well as other famous Vietnam films to a lesser extent. If you know your Vietnam war films you can play spot the scene relatively easily. This didn't have me belly rolling in laughter, but it did have some funny moments that raise a laugh and it is fairly easy going and humorous. The cast is pretty great, with many famous faces, not least Tom Cruise as a funny film exec and Nick Nolte as a Vietnam Veteran, but the one who stole the film for me had to be Robert Downey Junior who had me laughing at nearly every line he delivered, he was very funny and this film would've been a lot duller without him. The direction was good and the pyrotechnics were pretty impressive too. If you've seen other Ben Stiller films you'll know what to expect, this has plenty of his off the wall comedy, slightly crass jokes and lots of furrowed brows and pouting.

I don't understand why Ben Stiller thought this would be funny. There was some promise to this film. It could have been really funny. With a cast like Tropic Thunder had, you would think this film would be unstoppable.

You have Ben Stiller as the action hero Tugg Speedman, Jack Black as the drug addict Jeff Portnoy, and Robert Downey Jr as Australian actor Kirk Lazarus who changed the color of his skin for the role.

These guys are trying to make a big budget war movie. But things aren't going so well. They're behind scheduled and tempers are flaring. So the director and author of the book, decide to fly the actors into the middle of the jungle and have them think they are making the movie. (Think The Three Amigos)

There are some drug cartels in the forest who think the actors are DEA agents and we let the games begin. Stiller's character gets abducted by a child-led drug group and forced to replay a mentally retarded character. This is where the film goes from lame to just stupid.

Supporting cast includes Tom Cruise as a foul-mouthed studio exec. and Matthew McConaughy as Stiller's agent.

The constant crude language and horrible story kept me from enjoying what should/could have been a great comedy. They don't all have to be rated R you know.",1294099200,2,1301,4.6103896103896105

3624005,1,B001H5X7JS,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

When Ben Stiller first approached Robert Downey Jr. about acting in 'Tropic Thunder', Downey was quoted as saying, ""this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.""  Stiller reportedly replied, ""Yeah, I know--isn't it great?""  Somehow, in Stiller's mind, 'stupid' is equated with 'funny'.  Nonetheless, 'Tropic Thunder' was tremendously successful at the box office which I believe had little to do with the puerile script but more with the action sequences and special effects that appealed to the male teenage and young adult audience.  I'm reluctant to concede that Stiller has any talent in the area of screen writing but as a director of action sequences, he probably can hold his own with most of the action sequence directors out there today.

'Tropic Thunder' begins with some mildly amusing takeoffs on movie trailers and commercials. Rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon Jackson) promotes his 'Booty Sweat' energy drink and Stiller as Tugg Speedman in Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown where each sequel seems the same as the other.  Less successful is Jack Black's obnoxious 'The Fatties: Fart 2"" which consists of Black playing each character in a fat suit and farting continuously. The final trailer, 'Satan's Alley', starring Downey's ""Kirk Lazarus"" and Tobey MacGuire feature two monks attempting to repress their sexual longings for one another.  The takeoff is obviously designed to satirize such gay-themed movies as 'Brokeback Mountain'; it's a good way to start a comedy but things begin going downhill almost immediately after the opening sequence.

'Thunder' calls for a complete suspension of disbelief as to the plausibility of the plot.  I wondered why Vietnam would ever allow an American film crew to film a movie written in the style of the jingoistic 'Green Berets'.  That's where the film-within-a-film is initially being shot but the locale shifts to Laos (or possibly Myanmar) after the spineless Brit director Damien Cockburn is ordered by studio head Les Grossman to get his actors back in shape after the picture goes way beyond budget in the first week of filming.  At the suggestion of the author the film is based on, Tayback (who is later unmasked as a fake Vietnam veteran), Cockburn sets up cameras in the jungle and is assisted by his pyrotechnics expert, Cody, to create explosions which are designed to bring verisimilitude to the film. The cast is ordered by their newly self-actualized director to take a trek through the jungle with a hastily patched-together script as their guide.

I realize that 'Thunder' is not to be taken seriously at all but how do the filmmakers actually capture the footage which is later turned into an Academy Award winning documentary at the film's end?  They would have to have thousands upon thousands of cameras placed in every nook and cranny of the jungle to capture what the actors are doing.  I assume they later used surveillance footage from the Dragons' own cameras when the cast were being held captive in the heroin dealers' lair. But even so, Tayback and Cockburn's idea to create the documentary is too ludicrous for even a silly film such as this.

There is little to gain by rehashing Thunder's amateurish plot.  Suffice it to say it involves the kidnapping of Stiller's Speedman character along with Cody and Tayback (Nick Nolte) by a goofy Flaming Dragons gang.  The rest of the cast must earn their mettle by saving their buddies from the gang, despite the fact that all their weapons are mere props.  'Thunder' is supposed to be a satire on action films but by the time Stiller and his gang win their brownie points, you can't tell if this is really a satire or simply a bad action picture.

Stiller's main problem is a lack of imagination. For example, he'll come up with the bit about Kirk Lazarus dying his skin black and refusing to break character until we almost reach the film's end. How much can we take of Downey doing his shtick ad infinitum? The same goes for Stiller's 'Simple Jack'. According to Stiller, 'Jack' is not making fun of mentally handicapped people per se but rather actors like Dustin Hoffman who portray a caricature of an idiot savant in 'Rainman'. Stiller doesn't seem to realize that the idiot 'Simple Jack', is a far cry from Hoffman's brainy eccentric. Some people might find a Goofy Gumby such as 'Simple Jack' to be funny but after about ten minutes, can't we move on to something else? 'Thunder' intentionally is designed to be in bad taste but occasionally the films' scenarists ruin the comic tone by going too far. One such moment is when they actually kill off the director Cockburn; another moment is when Speedman kills a lovable Panda.

I wouldn't go so far as to say that 'Tropic Thunder' is the worst film of 2008 but it comes close. The make-up department however does deserve an award for making Tom Cruise unrecognizable as a sleazy, Hollywood producer.",1293580800,3,4919,4.916666666666667
3624036,5,B001H5X7JS,"Tropic Thunder is pure comic genius.  I can see how some people might find it offensive, but you know, sometimes comedy is offensive.  The film is satire of the highest order, and in some ways, is actually a multi-layered, nuanced, comic look at the entire film industry and world of film makers. Admittedly, the subtlety is easy to miss with the cheap, exploitative humor thrown in every 15 seconds or so.

What is truly funny is the bonus feature of ""Rain of Madness"", which is a fake documentary (mockumentary) on the making of the film Tropic Thunder (as if the film were actually being made by Tugg Speedman, Kirk Lazarus, Damien Cockburn, etc.).  The mockumentary is a perfect send-up of the real-life documentary ""Heart of Darkness"" about the making of ""Apocalypse Now"", only it is told as if directed by a Werner Herzog type film maker.  If you are familiar with Herzog's work, and listened to his riveting movie commentaries, you will appreciate how hilarious the mockumentary ""Rain of Madness"" really is.  Brilliant stuff, and accredited to actor Steve Coogan (who played the director in Tropic Thunder), and the co-writer of the film, Justin Theroux. Rain of Madness deserves to be seen by everyone who enjoys satire, but it really helps if you've seen Herzog's ""Grizzly Man"", or perhaps seen ""Fitzcarraldo"" or ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"" beforehand.

3624040,4,B001H5X7JS,"Tropic Thunder is a 2008 action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller and starring Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. as a group of prima donna actors filming a Vietnam War film when their fed-up writer-director decides to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.

What I expected from this movie was to have a good time laughing my ass off. Fortunately, it's funnier than most comedies I've seen in quite awhile. I didn't even find ""Superbad"" as funny as people made it out to be. Maybe I don't laugh as much as normal people. Unfortunately, the film didn't exceed my expectations. I expected more laughs but what can you expect? I'm just a non-laughable person.

But who cares if I didn't laugh as much as I expected to. I actually laughed, which must count for an accomplishment the film did. The beginning of the film starts off with faux trailers, like the ones shown during ""Grindhouse,"" so don't worry if you're not seeing the movie, even though you are seeing it. It just gives you what movies the protagonists are in.

Most of the laughs are close to the beginning and end and a little in the middle. The movie works as an action movie and a comedy, each actor seeming to have a fun time in their roles. I also like the fact that this movie has a lot of cameos (and when I say a lot, there is a lot) but I won't surprise you, even though there is one apparent name that is sticking out to you already.

Well, if you don't already know, I won't say it but if you do, you must know that after people see this movie, people would start to respect him as an actor, even though I never lost respect for this man. People will start to see him as a cool man. Like Morgan Freeman in ""Wanted,"" you'll hear and see things that this man has never done before and it's quite funny because his performance is so over-the-top.

It's not only him that may be the highlight of the movie, so the other is obviously Robert Downey Jr. How is he? He's very good and funny but all of you should know that by now. Everyone else in the movie also give off a few laughs, although the first two actors I've mentioned are probably the most memorable.

With some decent action scenes and very funny scenes, ""Tropic Thunder"" is the comedy to see this summer. One of the reason might be because of the cameos and over-the-top performances in here. Another is that this film actually made me laugh, which is an incredible feat for comedies to accomplish this year. For those reasons, I think it's a worthy admission to see it in theaters.",1288656000,,2560,4.367647058823529
3624041,5,B001H5X7JS,"Pardon me if I sound like Frasier Crane, but enjoying satire requires a certain intellectual distance. One has to be able to step outside one's normal view of things and imagine them as if they'd been pushed to their illogical conclusions. I'm not joking when I say that the inability of people to ""get"" ""Tropic Thunder"" or ""Idiocracy"" or ""Starship Troopers"" is correlated with social problems -- most notably the general stupidity of American society. (Do you think people like Karl Rove or Sarah Palin understand satire?)

Whatever...

Ben Stiller's approach to satire is not unlike Stan Freberg's -- you locate whatever is shallow, self-serving, or just plain stupid in your chosen subject, then hit it repeatedly with sledge hammer. (This works particularly well when satirizing war films.) The result is some of the most hysterically funny scenes I've seen in a long time. (Mervin Tuttle, in particular, would enjoy this film.) The first 15 minutes -- including the Coming Attractions trailers (""This preview has been approved for audiences""), and the consequences of Tug Speedwell's catching a rocket-propelled bomb in mid-air, are almost worth the price of admission.

3624069,4,B001H5X7JS,"No one can beat Ben Stiller at this kind of mock-heroic story.  The plot involves around a very contrived situation: a group of actors making a war movie overseas are dropped deep into the jungle, where they will improvise action sequences for hidden cameras.  But when the director is accidentally killed, the actors convince themselves its all part of their motivation, even when they run afoul of a village full of ruthless drug producers.  Much of the comic tension in the story comes from the actors' failing to realize that they are no longer playing make-believe, but are actually engaged in a real shooting war in the jungle.  Stiller's Hollywood enthusiasm is delightfully funny, given how oblivious he is to the realities of their situation, while the others express their doubts in silly bickering.  Eventually they are captured, of course, and there's a gallant rescue sequence and a very satisfactory conclusion, despite the absurdity of it all.

And those absurdities are really something.  Downey takes on a very challenging role, as a white Australian actor portraying a black man; overplaying the role, actually, and hitting all the stereotypical notes that make his lines incredibly funny even though he (the fictional actor, not Downey) doesn't get it.  This dovetails into an overarching theme of ""identity"" and ""being yourself"" that has to pass for the moral of the story, but in a work this crazed, who really cares?  All of the characters are more funny than convincing, so the story doesn't generate tension as much as a kind of expectancy.  So don't go in expecting a lot of deep character study - these guys are all pretty dumb, but they manage to do the right thing in the end.

But to me the funniest part of the film was the dialogue, particularly when the actors discuss various aspects of their business.  Downey's analysis of other actors' turns as mentally challenged characters is simply priceless: so politically incorrect that one feels dirty just watching it.  Ditto Jack Black's portrayal of a heroine addict.  In other hands this material could have been tragic, but Stiller doesn't allow us to take any of it seriously.

3624082,5,B001H5X7JS,"OK, so I am not a big Ben Stiller fan. As far as I am concerned, the man really cannot act and his films are gross, stupid and exploitative. But Tropic Thunder came recommended from my artsy kid, so I felt obligated to check it out. And glad I am that I did.

I don't ask or much from a film -- original ideas, tight writing, expressive acting, and a minimum of plot holes. Thankfully, craft is written all over this film. Stiller takes deadly aim at the Vietnam movie genre. The deliciously convoluted plot has Stiller's platoon shooting a Vietnam film that is far behind schedule and over budget. The only solution seems to be to put the spoiled actors in a warlike situation. But a series of events lands the boys in a real shooting war, and they need to use their meager wits to survive. By building his platoon from a potpourri of the genre's types, Stiller get to send up Nam films, the film industry, actors, and the genre's stock characters. His platoon has all the ingredients of the classic Nam film. There's the jive-talking black sergeant; the swaggering white honcho (Stiller), the nerd, the fat white guy (Jack Black) and the young black ""blood"". The combination gives Stiller the chance to set his types against each other to destroy old stereotypes. Taking method acting to the extreme, the older black character (Morton Downey, Jr.) is actually a white Aussie who underwent a pigmentation change for the movie. He speaks a 1960s black jive that thoroughly infuriates the ""real"" black character, a rapper who purveys a more contemporary ""street"" lingo. Behind this crew of misfits is Nick Nolte, playing a bedraggled, muttering, handless Vietnam war vet who wrote a book about his Nam exploits. An amazing Tom Cruise plays an out-of-control film mogul who strikes terror into his crews, even via teleconference.

Some of Stiller's swipes and plotting are pretty obvious. There's the big hetero character who turns out not to be and the big Asian crime boss who turns out not to be. And Stiller really has just two acting faces: stupidly confused and confusedly stupid. But, giving credit where credit is due, he was ridden the stupid horse all he way to the bank and beyond. Some folks might be offended by Stiller's portrayal of retarded ""Simple Jack,"" a recurring reference to a role from his character's past that demonstrates his low-rent talent. But it worked for Forrest Gump, didn't it?

In Tropic Thunder, Stiller is at his parodic best. Don't miss the fake previews (I did) that set up the characters in their own normal genres. And don't miss the numerous riffs on successful Nam movies -- Stiller's take-off on the iconic scenes from Apocalypse Now, for instance, make that film look like a parody of itself.

The second disk, filled with the de rigueur cast interviews, is just so-so. I don't care about how they used CGI sparingly, and I only saw enough of the storyboarding to begin to whet my appetite. The film's visuals are terrific and stand on their own -- better to watch Disk 1 twice. But lay down the subtitles, because a lot of the terrific writing is drowned out by copter noise and deliberately garbled delivery.

Great Stuff! I might go against my better judgment and pick up another couple Stiller films!",1258675200,,3247,4.739823008849558
3624083,3,B001H5X7JS,"Ben Stiller's action hero has been suffering from a slump in his career, and audiences are tiring of his many-sequelled SCORCHER franchise, and they didn't go for it when he went all Billy Bob Thornton on them and played SIMPLE JACK as a bid for an Oscar nomination.  He is the motive force behind the making of Tropic Thunder, but right away things go awry for a runaway production.  Poor Steve Coogan as the beleaguered director is blamed for the slow pace of the filming--they are weeks behind schedule on the very first day.

The movie is super funny in parts, but other parts were bad.  The whole set up that leaves Stiller (and a platoon of other actors) in the jungle without a clue, still believing they're making a movie, feels rushed and outlandish both at the same time.  But at the same time the actors involved were all good (except for Stiller).  Robert Downey Jr, as the Australian Daniel Day Lewis, Kirk Lazarus, is in blackface for his role here--and I didn't like that--but he's pretty amazing.  Jack Black is convincing as the world's chubbiest heroin and crack addict, while Jay Baruchel from the Judd Apstow universe is much more convincing here than in anything I've seen him in since UNDECLARED. The problem with TROPIC THUNDER in a nutshell is this.  For the movie to be funny, the actors have to hate each other.  For the plot to work, they have to develop, under unfortunate conditions, the esprit de corps of Gunga Din.  We can believe one alternative or the other, but don't ask us to do both.",1257897600,,1521,4.6
3624084,3,B001H5X7JS,"Ben Stiller is the most consistent media celebrity we have today. He often confuses being stupid with being funny, and his movies are mediocre but they are consistently mediocre and after a decade of his consistently mediocre movies (""Zoolander,"" ""Dodgeball,"" ""A Night at the Museum,"" etc.) we know how to best watch them: after a hard stressful day's work, laying on the living room couch drinking beer.

""Tropic Thunder"" is yet another mediocre movie with a formulaic hackneyed storyline, stupid dialogue, and a lame, half-hearted performance from Ben Stiller. Yet at the same time the cinematography (shot in the lush beautiful hills and jungles of southeast Asia) is spectacular, the cast is all-star, and there are some genuinely funny and enjoyable moments in the movie. In the movie theater who didn't laugh and smile when that obnoxious Brit Steve Coogan got blown-up? And Tom Cruise gives the best performance of his career, dressed up as a fat and balding tycoon who dances badly to hip hop.

And then there are two superb performances from Stiller's co-stars Jack Black and Robert Downey, Jr. Jack Black is outrageously funny as a heroin-addicted movie star whose signature performance is a fat man who farts. Robert Downey, Jr. is mostly incomprehensible with his slurred but rhythmic late sixties African-American slang and swagger but the idea of him playing an Australian who plays an African-American soldier is funny and it's always fun to watch him on the big screen -- even with this all-star cast Robert Downey Jr. is easily the most talented.

We have to give Ben Stiller credit for understanding the demands and mentality of todays' movie-going audiences. Ben Stiller provides a very light and entertaining film with moments of tremendous hilarity, and he mercifully keeps the experience short -- usually, only about ninety minutes. But we also know that Ben Stiller is a talented comedian, and it seems that nowadays he no longer cares so he no longer tries. The concept of a group of spoiled Hollywood stars filming an action movie only to find themselves in a real-life action situation is juvenile and cliche -- I'm sure that Ben Stiller in grade six had more creative ideas than this.

It's one thing to not care and not try but it's another to moralize at the same time. Halfway through the movie the two nemeses Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. have a silly conversation about playing retards in a movie. The Ben Stiller character says that he invested a lot emotionally into playing a retard, and felt often at times he was indeed a retard. The Robert Downey Jr. character, an Australian method actor who has already won five Academy Awards, replies that the secret is to be retarded without being fully retarded -- Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"" and Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"" looked retarded but they weren't, and that's what allowed the audience to emotionally identify with them -- and that's why they won Oscars.

I strongly disagree. If you're going to be stupid then just be stupid. The last really good comedy I saw was ""Blades of Glory,"" and that was just an outrageously silly affair -- and it made no attempt to disguise its silliness -- how could it be when its two main protagonist, after giving the figure skating performance of a lifetime, shot up to the sky on their skates and sailed the Heavens?

But ""Tropic Thunder"" holds back too much, and thus severely restrains the talents of its cast. The movie slowly and cleverly builds up the Jack Black character's heroin addiction, and when he -- after an agonizing couple of days without heroin -- actually finds himself in a heroin warehouse that should be the funniest moment of the whole movie. But the movie holds back -- because drugs are bad for you, I suppose. And then there's Matthew McConaughey who plays the Ben Stiller's character's agent, who when his client gets kidnapped by drug lords, is forced into a moral dilemma -- whether to save his client, or take a bribe from his Hollywood overlords to let his client die. I don't know about you but I think everyone in this whole world would pick a Gulfstream-Five over Ben Stiller but -- because Ben Stiller's the director, I suppose -- the agent chooses Ben Stiller.

I suppose that I can keep on critiquing the movie but at the same time I enjoyed it. And the reason is that I've been meaning to go to a movie for a long time, and there's nothing else out there that's watchable. So it's an advantage to be consistently mediocre when all your competitors are just getting worse and worse.",1257811200,,4545,4.782165605095542

Turns out the extra scenes in the director's cut were cut out of the original for a reason, they aren't funny. Not only that but they hurt the continuity of the movie and the characters. I would have really preferred if watching the theatrical version was an option on this blu-ray but it's not.

3624090,4,B001H5X7JS,"If you dislike a film that has foul language, violence, a pseudo amputee war vet, use of the word ""retarded"", Asian orphans depicted as demonic, trivializing drug addicts & drug lords, requiring some knowledge of Hollywood stereotypes and a higher attention span to appreciate some of the more subtle jokes, and/or a loose story line without a spectacular action packed, tear jerking ending, than this movie is probably not for you.

I had friends back from Iraq who understood the premise of the movie, but still found it distasteful and at the same time a Vietnam vet who loved it as it made fun of movies that he felt were ""Too Hollywood"" (including Platoon, sorry if some people find that hard to believe).

At a friend's house I witnessed the movie being stopped halfway through as a heated argument ensued between a mother (not offended by the film) of an adopted child from China essentially told my friend (a ""special needs"" teacher) to lighten up on the use of the word ""retard"" in the film. That night did not end well.

Okay, the point is there is nothing wrong if a person does not like the movie because it has something that offends him/her or that a person prefers movies with a tight script, consisting only of light hearted easy to follow humor, and/or a great Hollywood ending. But there is also nothing wrong if one likes this movie for what it is.

People who liked Ben Stiller's earlier films may find this one too extreme, but I found it a well thought out mockumentary of Hollywood's all out assault to exploit a story using pretentious actors/artists made famous from over the top commercialized characters.

This is highlighted when the ""novel author"" (Nick Nolte) of the film being made within this movie, boasts of how his ""real life"" story was chosen by Hollywood over all other decorated Vietnam vets stories.

The only problem with this is that his story is total fiction and underscores Hollywood's aversion to anything that sounds too realistic. Hence, whenever a movie says ""Based on a true story"", it really means 1% true story and 99% Hollywood Bling!

I can understand why some may not like/get this movie, but the one group of friends that I found that did like it, also liked Monty Python, Terry Gilliam flicks, Star Trek, and Family Guy. Go figure. So if you have similar likes, you will probably enjoy this movie.

In other words, if nothing from the afore mentioned offenses are of concern and one is willing to watch a film that follows more of an SNL script (albeit 2 hours long), then see the movie.

Also, make sure to see the Director's cut version (not the one that is only 106 minutes long).",1253923200,5,2639,4.658064516129032
3624091,4,B001H5X7JS,"TROPIC THUNDER in some ways is not a very good movie. It really doesn't hold together as a whole and there are a whole lot of flat or uninteresting bits. At the same time, there are many, many hysterically funny moments. It is one of those movies that you have to make a pact with: if you forgive it its many flaws, you can have a heck of a lot of fun.

I belong to that group of (not small in number) people who don't really care for Ben Stiller. I find his comic acting a tad too extreme and not terribly funny. But I confess that I enjoyed him in this film more than just about any I've seen him in. On the other hand, I often like Jack Black (I can't say ""always"" because of mistakes like NACHO LIBRE), but couldn't stand him in this one. On another hand (OK, I know that's three, but humor me), I absolutely detest Tom Cruise but loved him in this, though I have to confess that I didn't even know he was in it until someone explained to me who the chubby, bald-headed guy was. On yet another hand, I always love Robert Downey Jr., and I loved him in this one as well.

I really don't think this movie is susceptible to any kind of beneath the surface analysis. You either find it funny or you don't. You can either get over the film's many absurdities or you can't. I was able to, but I can understand if others cannot. The reaction to this film is likely to be pretty much on a person to person basis. And I think that is borne out here by the all-over-the-place reactions to the movie. As I write this the movie has 90 five-star and 72 one-star ratings.

First let me say that I'm not at all a fan of Ben Stiller movies, including ""There's Something about Mary.""  I find him difficult to watch and ""more stupid"" than funny.  However, this movie nearly made me spit my beverage across the room on several occasions.

I never liked Tom Cruise much either.  To me he makes Keanu Reeves look like Sir Laurence Olivier.  He is great in this movie; easily his best performance...yes, I said it.

Jack Black is, well the same Jack Black you've seen him in practically everything he's ever been in.  No surprises there.

If Hollywood awared best actor Oscars for ridiculous comedy, Robert Downy Jr. would win in a land slide for this.

I confess that I love politically incorrect humor.  Case in point, I thought ""Team America: World Police"" was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I rated it up there with the original Pink Panther films.  I'm a pretty tough sell for comedy films and for me to laugh out loud at a movie; it has to be screamingly funny.  Tropic Thunder is.

3624097,2,B001H5X7JS,"Okay, I get it:  TROPIC THUNDER is a parody of all the action/adventure movies; heck, it's a parody of Hollywood (and its greed) itself.  What's really disappointing is the movie hooks the viewer right away with some hilarious theatrical ""trailers"" featuring the three main protagonists (Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr.).  And then we're treated to an over-the-top intro of a Vietnam War epic in the making that is a total travesty.  The stars are dysfunctional, the movie is over budget, and the Viet vet novelist who penned the story (Nick Nolte) is nuts.  Hey, I'm on board, I'm laughing, I'm ready to enjoy some serious satire.

But once Nolte's character convinces the eccentric director (Steve Coogan) to actually maroon the cast in the jungles of Vietnam (with cameras and rigged explosives placed sporadically in the trees to capture the actors' reactions), and when the ensemble is actually confronted by a gang of drug lords, TROPIC THUNDER dissolves into petty goofiness.  The film meanders and the plot becomes just plain silly, Stiller is woefully nonsensical, and Black's talents are utterly wasted.  I did enjoy Downey's portrayal of an Australian character actor so intent to his craft he actually had his skin pigment darkened to ""become"" the African American character he was playing, and for once Jay Baruchel wasn't overly annoying.  But that aside, TROPIC THUNDER had such potential, and then squandered it; not even a supporting cast including Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise can salvage this gobbler.

3624098,5,B001H5X7JS,"THE MOVIE

Tropic Thunder amazed audiences when it came out earlier this year. What originally looked to be a highly entertaining, if not stupid, comedy turned out to be a highly entertaining, action-packed comedy that lampoons not only war movies, but also a host of Hollywood clichs and personalities.

The film revolves around three fading actors-the award winner (Robert Downey, Jr.), the action star (Ben Stiller), and the comedian with a declining quality of films (Jack Black). Joining them is the up-and-coming rap superstar with a number of licensed products (Brandon Jackson). They're brought together when director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) decides to make an epic, big-budget war film. Unfortunately for him, the stars don't give a rat's ass about the production, and after only weeks of shooting the film is already way behind schedule, and way above budget.

Cue the Vietnam vet who wrote the book the in-movie movie is based upon, who suggests that to make it authentic, they film in the Vietnam jungles where soldiers once fought. Thinking the idea brilliant, Cockburn flies them out and begins trying to film guerilla style, with fake traps, actors, and events scripted unbeknownst to the actors in order to get realistic and lifelike reactions. Unfortunately, things go horribly wrong when the four actors find themselves not in the middle of the movie, but in the middle of a real warzone, with real Vietnamese drug lords hunting them down in order to kill the ""American troops.""

The movie works on a number of levels. On one hand, it's brilliant as an over-the-top comedic action title. Stiller and his crew worked on the script for nearly a decade, and it shows through both the dialog, action, and referential treatment of Hollywood throughout. Tom Cruise, in the most brilliant performance he's given in years, plays an aging, balding, overweight film exec who cares only about the money and not the people in the movies. Meanwhile, the four stars, their agents, the director, the author, the sound guy, and many other cameo appearances parody any number of Hollywood ideas and personalities. Viewed as either a satire of war films, or as a satire of Hollywood, Tropic Thunder delivers on both levels with A-list performances, memorable scenes, and lots of fun action.

Movie Score: 4/5

THE DISC

The Blu-ray transfer of the film is, in one word, incredible. Presented in 1080p and an AVC-encoded package, the colors are vibrant, blacks are great, and the action on screen is bright and pops realistically. From textures of clothing and plants to mottled, grimy skin, the details are explicitly clear in the film; much more so than in theaters. It's a great film visually, and further testament to Paramount's ongoing claim as the best publisher of Blu-ray titles.

The TrueHD audio is no different. While there's little in terms of subtlety and cleanness throughout the film, the action is very clear, the bass is booming, and the ambiance of the jungle comes through as if you're there. Both visually and audibly, Tropic Thunder on Blu-Ray is reference quality that will impress any guests.

Unfortunately, while the special features are entertaining, there's nothing unique to the Blu-ray version-save the need to access BD-Live to watch two of them. The features list is a carbon copy of the DVD release, and while the extras are presented in high-def, it would have been nice to get some BR-exclusives.

There's the usual commentaries, deleted scenes, and production features. The most entertaining extras are easily the Rain of Madness mockumentary, which is a parody of the Hearts of Darkness documentary from Apocalypse Now, and Full Mags, which features alternate improvisations from the set by the crew. Rain of Madness is hilarious, and at 30 minutes is quite beefy for what it is. If you enjoy documentaries or have even watched one, it's a must-see because you'll be laughing your ass off.

In the end, Tropic Thunder on Blu-ray is a must-buy for fans of comedy, action, or satire. It's a wonderfully biting and intelligent movie filled with plenty of explosive action, and presented with one of the cleanest video and audio transfers out yet. Buy it, watch it, love it, watch it again-just don't skip it.

Tropic Thunder, though I guess not technically a ""guy movie,"" falls into that category.

If you aren't familiar with the plot, here's the skinny: a group of spoiled movie stars is making an action film (based on a ""true"" story) set during the Vietnam War. When the fed-up director decides to drop the whiny cast off in the jungle and film the project guerilla-style, he accidentally steps on an old land mine, stranding the celebrities in the middle of some very real danger.

What makes the movie hilarious is that the people involved in this project weren't afraid to poke fun at the insanity that is Hollywood. We have Tug Speedman (Ben Stiller), the washed-up action star; Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), the eccentric, critically-acclaimed method actor; Jack Portnoy (Jack Black), the scatological comedian; Alpa Chino (Brandon Jackson), the rapper trying to crossover into film; and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel), the smart Jewish newcomer. If this core cast wasn't enough, the film features inspired supporting appearances and cameos by everyone from Tom Cruise to Nick Nolte to Danny McBride to Matthew McConaughey to Jennifer Love Hewitt to Tobey McGuire.

I sat down to watch, grimly expecting my intelligence, taste and sense of humor to be insulted for two hours... but contrary to those low initial expectations, both ""George"" and ""Tropic Thunder"" turned out to be very, very funny movies.

The opening sequence to ""Tropic Thunder"" - seemingly a series of trailers for the sort of film that I avoid like the plague was hilarious, and all the more pointed for really, really looking like trailers for real films. Apparently it has taken quite a few watchers to realize these trailers were part of ""Tropic Thunder"" - the essential set-up for the main plot. Which says something about the current state of Hollywood, and sets the tone for the subsequent two hours of gleeful skewering of war movies like ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", over-involved method actors who don't drop character until the last commentary is completed on the DVD release, actors who play every damn part in a fat suit, fake Vietnam War vets and the memoirs they write, out-of-control movie spectaculars involving protracted and expensive location shoots and a whole range of directorial pathologies. That the director, Ben Stiller could induce a whole array of fairly well-known actors to go along with him in poking well-aimed fun at everything to do with their profession does argue that Hollywood as a whole has not entirely lost a sense of humor about itself.

The plot, such as it is, concerns a wildly expensive and over-budget war movie spectacular being shot on location with an all-star cast, a la ""Apocalypse Now"". Lurching wildly out of control, the producer and moneybags (a profane, practically unrecognizable and differentially hirsute Tom Cruise) is about to pull the plug. The desperately overwhelmed director connives to drop his stars into a bit of reality - turning them loose in the jungle, and film them at a distance as they complete their impossible mission. Only a couple of things interfere with this - like the director himself getting blown up on an old landmine, and the actors (in full ""Tour of Duty"" regalia) encountering a jungle drug processing plant, and the wildly assorted thugs who control it ... movie fans all.

Of the extras on the second disc, the best - and which is even funnier than the movie is the fake documentary ""Rain of Madness"" and ""Dispatches from the Edge of Madness"" by a comically pretentious and portentous documentary filmmaker on the set of the alleged original movie.

Despite not liking Stiller's usual B comedies or Jack Black's zany acting, the reason I decided to give this movie a watch was I visited Kauai when they were filming it there and figured gotta watch it for that reason alone.

Story: Lot of good jokes, both written and visual. Camera work looks as if they're trying too hard for that gritty war film style, probably the point, since it comes off as melodramatic and goofy. A lot of good observational jokes on the stereotypes found in a lot of Hollywood action/war films.

Video: This blu-ray looks good. Vibrant colors, sharp lines, and despite all the outside shooting, the picture does not suffer from grain, take this w/ a grain of salt since my tv is a 32"".

Audio: Very clear audio track, dialogue very clear, music and sound efx sound great.

3624152,5,B001H5X7JS,"There aren't many movies that live up to the hype seen on previews and ads. Fewer still in the comedy genre that might have a shot at an Oscar. But TROPIC THUNDER does both thanks to a sturdy screenplay, perfect acting, and some of the funniest dialogue you'll hear this year.

Standing out amongst other ridiculous comedies that often go for the cheap-shot, Tropic Thunder hits higher comedic notes thanks to a plethora of items. First is the screenplay. From the VERY BEGINNING of the film, you immerse yourself in these characters' lives. My advice to movie-watchers is to show up early and watch the previews, as you're in for a not-so-subtle surprise. The ""faux-previews"" were an excellent way to introduce the characters and get an immediate feel for who they were. And who are they? Ben Stiller (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-at-the-Museum/dp/B000NOKJBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night at the Museum</a>) stars as Tugg Speedman, an actor on the downward slide of success. Having been a big action star (think Sly Stallone), Tugg is having difficulties procuring decent roles. Although Stiller does a fine job as the actor-turned ...well ...actor, he doesn't hit the mark in terms of losing himself in the part like others did (see below)...

Jack Black (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nacho-Libre/dp/B000HDZK1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nacho Libre</a>) is Jeff Portnoy, a two-bit actor who's comedies are all about gaseous releases (""Everybody laughs at me just because I fart!""). He's also an addict and when he tries to clean up in the jungles of Vietnam, Black turns in some of the funniest bit lines of the film (many of which I can't state here and earned this film its firm R rating). In terms of acting history, Portnoy's follows similar terrain as that of Eddie Murphy in his fat suit films.

Brandon T. Jackson stars as Alpha Chino (need I say more? Yes? Okay). A rough, tough, black man with a gentler -- shall we say -- feministic side, Jackson battles his sexuality as well as his ethnicity.

Jay Baruchel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knocked-Up/dp/B001CW7ZUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knocked Up</a>) comes on as Kevin Sandusky, the only ""normal"" guy in this cadre of demented and damaged actors. He envies their acting histories and has a bit of hero worship going on with one of them. He also turns out to be the glue that helps hold the gang together. Think Tom Hanks in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B000NA7WS0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>&nbsp;and you'll be close.

And saving the absolute best for last, we have bad-boy Robert Downey Jr. (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001GAPC1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>) as Kirk Lazurus, a confused white man gone black, and lost amidst his multiple character personalities. Watching him peel back his personas toward the end of the film was sheer genius. Lazurus so immerses himself in-character that he doesn't come out ""until the special features on the DVD."" He's also tough to deal with. And he's an Aussie. And he's a great actor. Sound like anyone you know? Russell Crowe should rapidly come to mind.

The screenplay must get notice here, too. And mentioning that Justin Theroux had his hand in it. This is the same Theroux who starred in the sensational series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Six-Feet-Under/dp/B000HEVZBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Six Feet Under</a>. He seems to have understood how to come up with comedy that isn't&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dumb-and-Dumber/dp/B001IKKMD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dumb and Dumber</a>, and hits the mark head-on.

The dialogue is simply astounding, especially when coupled with these well-knowns in the comedic field. But Downey Jr. is the real star here, delivering his lines with flawless precision and in a voice that irritates the heck out of Alpha Chino, a real black guy who finds Lazurus' constant in-characterness to be grating and insulting.

This is truly a phenomenal piece of cinema, with action and comedy meshed so well together that there's not a single moment for the mind to rest.

Downey steals the show here with his portrayal of the hippest brother ever to grace the screen: ""I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude.""  Please rent this if you like to laugh. One of the few films that get funnier with multiple viewings as you begin to appreciate the incredible subtleties and genius of Downey's performance.  The guy is simply more black than black dudes! The portrayal is done with taste and I hope it is not offensive considering the legacy of blackface.  It would be a shame if someone was hurt by this film.

Downey deserved the Oscar for this instead of Ledger.  It is much more difficult to portray someone when the audience has a frame of reference (a black dude), as opposed to Ledger's obscure portrayal of a psychopath. Ledger had the luxury of playing that role however he saw fit, and we would never know if he was off the mark or not.

Like Borat in 2006, evryone kept saying that it's the funniest movie ever, which it wasn't. I don't recall laughing at all in Borat...it was stupid and lame. Same here in Tropic Thunder, I didn't see the humor. the only joke from Stiller I found kinda funny was when the little Vietnamese kid starts hitting Stiller and he accidentally does the voice of Simple Jack...other than that..Nothing from Stiller. Downey Jr had a lot of good moments. But the whole Tom Cruise thing was way overrated.

Now for those wanting to know what this movie is, or what it was trying to do was pretty much spoof on war films...unsuccessfully though. Tropic Thunder's main problem is that it tries way too hard with the jokes; every joke felt as if it was just made to chuckle...Not really laugh at. Now on the other hand Jack Black saved some parts of the movie, he gave this film what it was mainly lacking...which was humor.

So overall this is not a movie I would have in my collection, I saw it once and regretted buying it, now I have to sell it. If you are curious rent it...but if you want a good comedy watch instead Office Space, Meet the Parents or Superbad...now those movies are funny and smart.

The acting is stellar for a comedy(Robert Downey Jr anyone), and Ben Stiller's directing is also very top notch. The cinematography is nice to look at and this is a well made film. The story molds together elements of Platoon, Deerhunter, Rambo, and others, and creates one of the wackiest comedies in sometime.

Two extreme points of view that had me wondering which side of the opinion aisle I was going to stand on. Consider the two stars my answer. This movie was hugely disappointing. Critics seemed to love it because it skewers Hollywood, another of those insider movies that, for me, are far more smarmy and self-congratulatory than they are funny or memorable. Mel Brooks has always done this kind of thing well but Ben Stiller is not Mel Brooks and Tropic Thunder isn't even in the same ballpark as Blazing Saddles or even Silent Movie. The problem is that they spend so much time ripping on each other in some glorious back-stabbing fest that they forget about the rest of us who neither care about studio moguls, agents, or bloated celebrities nor find them people who are interesting, at least I don't. Whether Tom Cruise plays a great studio exec or Matthew McConaughey pulls off the loyal agent to Stiller's Tugg character are considerations that have no interest to me. None of the characters is that interesting and it is hard to care about the vanities of actors or the Hollywood pecking orders therein. There are no really funny jokes, the plot is ridiculous, the gags get tired very early on, and the best part of the movie is the opening pseudo-trailers. You know a movie misses the mark when the best it can do with Jack Black is reduce him to a smack-addicted Hollywood clich going through withdrawals in the jungle. Hilarious! I'm sure Robert Downey, Jr. found much to laugh about in art imitating life, but I sure didn't. This movie is as predictable as it is dull: Stiller is an aging action hero who believes his own hype, Downey, Jr. is a method actor who spends so much time getting into other characters that he has none of his own, the gangsta rapper-turned-actor turns out to be a closeted homosexual, and the one untainted guy, the nerdy nave newbie played by Jay Baruchel is the lone touchstone the rest of us are supposed to identify with. And yet, he worships the very people who are so unappealing to me! Everyone is a phony, brown nosed, spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. Why would I care what happens to any of them? Whether this movie is accurate in how it sends-up movie making and all the boorish people involved is beside the point. I simply don't care at all about that E! garbage and watching a two-hour movie that had all the thrill of being the outsider at a work party was a huge waste of time.

I seem to malign Stiller's humor, but truly, he points up some of the most irritating American foibles and American weaknesses with great ability.  For instance, the complete lack of understanding of what's going on around them, the seemingly desperate need for substances to block out reality, the certainty of American importance and the silliness of celebrity--all are done to the max and rightly so.  I hazard to suspect that what is seen as humor is really a chastisement of our worst traits.  If one doesn't sit up and recognize these things, no one is paying attention or thinking very hard.  Probably the worst problem we have.

Though it often borderlines on being excessive, Tropic Thunder is a very, very funny send-up of the Hollywood movie-making process, and is a sheer blast to behold.  Ben Stiller (who also co-writes and directs) stars as fading action star Tugg Speedman, who headlines the cast of big budget Vietnam-era flick.  Along for the ride are actors Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black in a role clearly based on Chris Farley) and multiple award winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr in an Oscar nominated role) who is such a deep character actor that he underwent an operation to turn himself black.  That's one of the pleasures of Tropic Thunder: it doesn't care who it offends, and it's all the more glorious for it.  There's so many surprises and off the wall moments that you will be constantly glued to the screen, and the trio of Stiller, Black, and Downey are hysterical.  Also featuring Steve Coogan, Nick Nolte, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, an actually funny Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise in prosthetics as the foul-mouthed producer.",1233705600,,1094,4.886486486486486

I just didn't care about any of them - they were all one-dimensional. I know, in a way that that is the point - they are all supposed to be one-dimensional actors - but that joke kind of carries on into this film, making Stiller, Black, Downey et al all seem boring. Downey Jr. is great, but the joke wears thin, and is kind of dealt with in the first few minutes of the film.

When I first saw this in theaters, I thought it was funny. Not hilarious, but funny. However, the beauty of having a copy to watch at your own leisure makes for a much more comfortable and self-paced approach, which in the end did wonders for this comedic gem. I've always liked Ben Stiller. To me, he's a somewhat more refined version of Will Ferrell and uses a bit more ""satire-goofy"" style as opposed to ""juvenile-goofy."" In Tropic Thunder, we see a hilarious self-parody of actors acting as actors who are also.. acting. No, it's not as whimsical or intellectually jabbing as a Coen Brothers or Larry David project, but the degree of absurdity is still every entertaining to watch if you find just the right balance between all these quirky characters. Stiller does his usual thing with the insecure, thick-brained fellow just trying to find himself, while Jack Black makes for a very convincing heroin addict going off and on his highs and withdrawls. But the two performances I enjoyed the most were Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus and Tom Cruise's Les Grossman.  Downey Jr. continues to amaze me with his various performances, and this after making Iron Man of all things.  And as crazy as Cruise is off camera, I've liked him as an actor for most of his career, and he does a splendid job playing the fat, hairy, hyperactive, money-grubbing, Diet Coke-ing businessman. The story is silly, yet addicting, and the dialogue is full of great one-liners you can recite to yourself or around friends. Watch it for what it's worth and enjoy.

Video - 4.5

Being a sort of comedic-action movie, I was actually surprised at how great the video looked. Cinematography in particular shoots many a beautiful landscape, expressing lots of lush greens during daytime scenes, accompanied by great levels of detail and depth upon action sequences (especially on the foreground). Some of the indoor shots and night time scenes were a bit grainy, and I think the colors were just a tad softer on a few scenes that involved closeups of the actors, detracting this from a perfect rating. But given that this is more so a comedy film than action, it's definitely a well-efforted transfer by the people at Dreamworks.

Audio - 4.5

While presented with a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track, keep in mind that this a comedic-action movie (more emphasis on the ""comedic"" part), so it's important to remember how this can effect a movie's sound design. Thankfully, though, it doesn't make much of a difference at all, and they did a great job anyway. Music and helicopter effects in the opening sequence are reference quality, in my opinion. Dialogue throughout the entire film is easy to hear and understand (yes, even Downey Jr's ebonics), but I do wish they had given gunshots and explosions a little more oomph. Overall directionality is quite immersive placing every sound where you think it'd be coming from. But again, some of the action sounds were a bit more underwhelming than I wanted. If you're friends can't tell the difference, though, tell them it's reference and see how they react.

Extras - 4.5

While not high in quantity (perhaps an additional 25GB disc would've helped?), the special features presented are pretty fun in their own right with commentaries, ""making of"" featurettes, and deleted/extended scenes. I had no idea this film was 10 years in the making until they said it, but I would have to say the dividends really paid off after all this time. I also liked the Les Grossman dance test and found it hilarious to a see a half-costumed Tom Cruise booty dancing to no music. It's a fairly good amount of quality extras for just a single 50GB disc and gives you a bit of insight from all the cast and crew and should be watched at least one time through.

Overall - 4.5

It's not a perfect movie with perfect technical specifications, but it's close. To this date, it is by far the funniest of Stiller's movies that I've seen, and it's full of laughs all over the place. If you like quirky characters and an equally absurd storyline to suit them, then definitely give this a watch, if not at least for the faux movie trailers at the beginning.",1233273600,,4156,4.742382271468144

Although this film is really quite good, if you popped Three Amigos into Apocalypse Now, this is what you would get, Amigolypse Now if you like.

Its all rather over the top and fun, Tom Cruise is ok, Downy is ok, although I felt the joke wore a little thin after a while. The people who would probably enjoy this the most are probably actors, it would be great to actually have the insight into if actors really as big a bunch of self-absorbed butt wads as the film portrays, ok, we know they are but the film sometimes plays a little like an in-joke. You know, Like ""Pret-a-Porter"" but actually funny. Ish.

As parody movies go, this is one of the better recent ones, it's not as good as the classics like Airplane or Top Secret (Val Kilmer doing humour!!!???), and I didn't like this as much as Zoolander which I rate as one of the funniest films of recent times, I never fail to kill myself laughing at Project Catwalk on the TV where one of the judges not only acts like ""Mugatu"" but looks like him as well! Anyway, back to Tropic Thunder. It's a good movie to rent on a sat night but I wouldn't buy it, I cant imagine watching it multiple times like I would Zoolander for example. But, it's OK!

But the movie is just stupid.  The premise is funny, and I knew the premise going in - prima-donna actors doing a film on Viet Nam go off-set and think they are still filming a movie when they get caught up in a drug lord operation and are under real attack.

But it is poorly executed and just over the top camp.

I was surpised no Private Gomer Pyle and Sergeant Carter showed up. When a group of actors is dropped into a real war zone somewhere around Cambodia after their director can't get them to cooperate, things get dangerous and interesting. A new side of the actors is seen, and not necessarily a better side on all cases. Jack Black's character wants to jump into the Heroine in the camp where they must rescue their technical advisor, FX man, and a fellow actor. Good quality DVD with a few extras.

A really committed performance, that I initially thought should be nominated for something. To go down the list of performances, it seems that Robert Downey is getting all the praise, but my favorite was Jay Baruchel. I would also like to see more of Bill Heder, as Cruise's lackey.

3624252,3,B001H5X7JS,"By now I imagine most people are familiar with the basic plot of TROPIC THUNDER, spoiled actors filming a war movie who are dumped in a real war zone by their fed-up director. For me this comedy suffers from very peculiar pacing, with jokes being presented and dismissed with such speed that it seems like viewers are being coddled like children with short attention spans. Many times I thought to myself that I would have laughed at some humorous bit if it had only been presented more skillfully. The entire role of hip hop icon, turned brand mogul turned actor Alpa Chino is dealt with so quickly one feels there must have been drastic pressure to limit the film's running time.

The long-running gimmicks, with Tom Cruise in a fat suit as a brutal Hollywood producer and Robert Downey Jr. in blackface speaking African American Vernacular English generally prove the most memorable. Cruise's role is far from the walk-on cameo many might have expected, and especially towards the end his role really dominates the film. The actor might be able to save his career if he focused on more comedic turns like these.

I don't think TROPIC THUNDER will show the kind of longetivity of Stiller's earlier film ZOOLANDER, which still charms new audiences years after its theatrical run. See it if it draws you, but you won't miss much if you skip it.",1231804800,,1344,4.739316239316239

There are some cameos that I thought were cool, and the location must've been a challenge to film in. I wanted to compare this to Airplane, but it is not even the same style. The dialogue, though funny, is not full of the wit that was in Airplane. Then again, there are some classic lines that I'll likely memorize the next few times I see it.

As for the stars, Stiller plays Stiller. Robert Downey is a real hoot as an Aussie trying to play an American homeboy. Nick Nolte was great as the grizzled old fake sarge that wrote a book the story is based on. Matthew McConaghey is a rip as the agent. Jack Black reminded me of Chris Farley with his over the top antics. However, the most surprising was Tom Cruise. I've never seen him in anything even remotely like that, and I loved it. I haven't been too happy with some of his recent movies, so this was a real treat.

The over the top gore was done in a cartoonish way, and is a perfect satire to the gore from many a more serious movie. I also like that they didn't censor the language, and actually talked like people in that situation would talk.

The biggest flaw was that the renegade Viet Cong looked like they would be more at home in South America than Southeast Asia. Maybe that was deliberate too.

All in all, this is my type of movie. Stupid fun. Now if they'd had an icky bug (monster) in it that ate half the characters, it would have made my five stars. Highly recommended.",1231718400,,1634,4.191082802547771
3624255,4,B001H5X7JS,"Tropic Thunder takes an absurd, behind the scenes look at a blockbuster Hollywood production while satirizing the war film genre. From tongue in cheek jabs at great war flicks like Platoon and Apocolypse Now, to prima donna actors, to Tinsel Town power brokers (Tom Cruise's best performance of late), nothing is sacred. Stiller's humor is over the top and razor sharp, Jack Black does what he does best, fart jokes and physical comedy, and Robert Downey Jr. is nothing short of amazing.

The special features include the standard behind the scenes featurettes and deleted/extended scenes, but hidden among them are two gems. Rain of Madness does for ""Making of"" documentaries what Tropic Thunder does for Hollywood blockbusters.  Also included is the sketch from the 2008 MTV music awards showing Stiller, Downey, and Black trying to come up with a viral marketing video. The clip had me laughing as much or more than the feature did.

If you are into satire and silliness, Tropic Thunder is a solid fun movie.",1231718400,,1011,4.970414201183432

3624257,4,B001H5X7JS,"That said, I did find this film mildly entertaining, though I won't blast it.

Tom Cruise pushed the envelope on total silliness -- I didn't even recognize him as the evil producer. WOW!

Making a movie about making a movie, with character actors who are suppressing their comedic and Stallone-type roots to make a Vietnam flick and get thrown into a real jungle environment, being hassled by agents and heroin gun-toting criminals -- and a 12 year old running the whole operation -- not family friendly to say the least.

The fake trailers at the start were hilariously funny -- especially the Toby MacGuire Satan's Alley at a theater near you.

Jack Black tries way too hard to be funny to a point of not being funny -- although his faked films were indeed to be desired -- leaving, much.

Stiller running across an exploding bridge, guts spilling out and head gore were a bit much -- but you can't fault them for creativity.

My DVD had lots of extras, making-of, and interviews with Robert Downey Jr. (who threw out the comment that Ironman was going to be a trilogy -- say what?)

If you like a fresh take on satire, check this one out -- but as a rental.

""Tropic Thunder"" begins with fake trailers for fake movies and fake products of the characters, and play like bits from the old ""Ben Stiller Show"" on Fox.  (You remember, right?  From around 1990?  10 pm on Sundays?  With ""Flying Blind,"" it was the funniest hour on TV.)

Then the movie kicks into gear.  Imagine a loopy ""Hearts of Darkness"" with some fake blood and guts, and you get the general idea.  While Stiller, Downey and company keep the plot moving, Tom Cruise steals the show as the demented, over-the-top studio head.  As much as I don't care for many of his off-screen antics and causes, he has to get credit where credit is due.  Nick Nolte and Matthew McConaghy also do very well with the small amount of screentime they get.  The plot progresses pretty much as you would expect, with some funny surprises along the way.

""Tropic Thunder"" is not for the easily offended, and is not suitable for young children.  This may be why this movie garners so many 1 star reviews.  But if you don't mind a little offensiveness in the service of excellent comedy, you will probably like this film.  It's at least worth a rent.",1231200000,,1299,4.510729613733906

Through a series of blunders, the actors unknowing land in the middle of a turf drug war and believe the gunfire and explosions going on around them are all part of the production.

No this isn't Oliver Stone and it isn't Francis Ford Coppola.  It is Ben Stiller and an unbelievably accomplished troop of performers that includes superstars Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey in small roles and has Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey at the top of their games.

The jokes aimed at satirizing Hollywood come as fast as an episode of Entourage, a show which probably inspired McConaughey's fast-talking agent and Cruise's Machiavellian studio lord.  A tough genre to satirize, the film levels its gag cannon directly at some of the best Vietnam films of the past decades and scores a direct hit.

The film's neatest achievement is the opening, as viewers know immediately the kind of actors involved because the film presents fake trailers for upcoming movies of the Stiller, Black and Downey characters.  Not only do the trailers inform, but they also entertain, especially the one featuring Downey's multi-Oscar winner playing a gay monk in a period piece with Tobey Maguire (just one of many great cameos).

The film has a huge budget for casting, explosions, locations and all other aspects of making a big picture.  And they spent their money well.  Yeah, the ""awards movies"" like Slumdog and Button are better films, but nothing made this year did a better job achieving its ambitions than Tropic Thunder, and it should receive strong consideration as one of the ten best films of the year.",1231027200,2,1756,4.902027027027027

That was all I could take.  This movie was just too violent and gory and disgusting.  It was NOT intelligent satire.  It was just gross!!

Especially after seeing some recent news clips of the fighting in the Middle East I just couldn't find anything funny about how Mr. Stiller was depicting violence and gore.

It is a shame because the premise was great and Stiller is usually very adept at creating somewhat silly and benign satire.  AND the first few minutes with the fake trailers were HYSTERICAL!  That WAS satire.  Then it just got gross.  I can't even recall how many times I had to cover my eyes because what was on the screen was just gross!! And when I wasn't covering my eyes I wasn't laughing at the jokes either.

When we purchased the tickets for it the woman behind the counter gave us a funny look, then told us that if we don't like it we can come back up and get our money back within 10 minutes after it started.  That seemed a very odd thing to say.  I sure had never heard anyone say something like that before, and wondered what she knew that we did't.  Me and my mom exchanged a look and as we entered I asked, ""What the heck have we got ourselves into here?"".

The very first scene of the movie starts up and it was very raunchy to say the least.  We again exchanged an uncomfortable glace.  Then, we proceded to laugh so hard our stomachs hurt.  It was raw, it was foul, and it was funny as hell.  Although I admit I could have done with a few less ""F"" bombs, it was still a great movie.

I can kind of understand the ticket girls statement.  I'm sure she thought going to see such a movie with one's mother would be ackward. But, she doesn't know my mother, the woman who after watching Jackass was still laughing more than an hour later.

I don't have much to say about the movie itself, just thought it was an amusing story.  Although it does get a bit slow in the middle and I really could have done without that kid.

3624292,4,B001H5X7JS,"OK, up front, ""Tropic Thunder"" is a Ben Stiller movie--written, directed, produced, and starred in--and that makes the film suspect. But wait! It's a fun, fun movie! I had to watch it twice to list all the allusions to other movies, mostly parodic allusions, sometimes serious, mostly not.

Ben Stiller as Tug Steadman is a Rambo imitator, including the number of sequels of the first successful Rambo movie. These films are previewed at the beginning of ""Tropic Thunder."" In fact, these previews ARE the beginning to set up the actors as actors. Jack Black is a gross Eddie Murphy and all the other characters played by Jack Black in his take-off of ""The Nutty Professor.""

Robert Downey, Jr. plays a fabulous method actor who ""lives"" his characters, including Neil Armstrong (when they found him in a Hollywood alley trying to re-enter Earth's gravity via a refrigeration box). He has had himself surgically made up to look like the black character he is portraying. But which actor? I narrowed it to Omar Epps or Morgan Freeman, but it could be Tim Meadows from Saturday Night Live, who imitated every black person who ever lived. Whatever, you won't recognize him until he removes his black facial maskings to reveal Mel Gibson or Crocodile Dundee (as Downey is an Australian actor). Being a great method actor allowed him to learn Mandarin Chinese for one of his five Oscars (another nod to parody).

In another acknowledgement of great actors Downey also plays Peter Sellers (I'm not sure which role). But the BEST paeon to other actors is Ben Stiller's nod to Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now,"" the scene at the end when he has has turned inward as the master of the village. This ""Brando"" is the master of an acting role as ""Simple Jack,"" another bow to Robin Williams in ""Jack,"" both supremely failed movie projects. As Downey's character tells Stiller, ""Never go full retard,"" and he lists all the movies that actors played and won awards for characters ""not full retard.""

This is awful to say but I think Nick Nolte plays a failed actor (himself), trying to redeem himself through heroic actions. But the best role goes to Tom Cruise as a tough corporate studio head. Ironically, he resembles Bill Gates and the name of the studio is IMAC Corporation. I didn't like this guy until I realized it was Tom Cruise, then the role became a study in actorly talent. His rap dancing is a great way to ""wrap"" the movie.

Matthew MacConaughey pretty much plays all the characters he ever plays in a parody of himself, but he shows deep concern when TC is going make money off the death of Ben Stiller. How he saves Stiller is not to be missed (or believed!).

So, I've presented the redeeming features of this surprisingly entertaining film. There is much more:
1. Brandon Jackson--I loved this character, Alpa Chino (say it aloud), who squealed an imitation of Chris Tucker, who co-starred with Jackie Chan.
2. Jay Beruchel as the young actor who plays young soldiers who become men during the course of the story
3. Brandon Soo Hoo, the boy leader of the drug cartel in the Laos/Cambodia/Myanmar drug capital (Golden Triangle), in acknowledgement of the little boys who are made into vicious, killing soldiers in war-torn areas of the world and an Asian actor, who, of course, is a martial artist!
4. Downey's two lines: ""No Man Left Behind"" -- a not-so-subtle reminder of ""No Child Left Behind"" and its failure, and ""Be all you can be.""

At the risk of damaging my reputation as a respectable reviewer, I embrace this movie for what Stiller did with it. The many references put together work really well in celebrating other movies, even if presented in parody. If you are a movie buff, watch ""Tropic Thunder"" not for itself, but for what it represents.",1230336000,,3758,4.754601226993865

Oddly, it's not Ben Stiller who's the funniest character in this film, but that's not unusual for films Stiller both directs and stars in. There were, however, two characters I found laugh out-loud funny. First, Less Grossman (played wonderfully over the top by Tom Cruise) is simply hilarious. Cruise should consider doing more comedy; it might just save his flagging career. Second, Robert Downey, Jr., is great as Kirk Lazarus, an actor who goes through surgery in order to look like the African-American character he's playing. At first, you're thinking this is just a little too much, but he just grows on you as the film continues.

Normally, Stiller's films are not my cup of tea, but I found Tropic Thunder to be hilarious.",1230249600,,1038,4.782122905027933

Aside from a brief laugh in the beginning, I spent the bulk of the movie trying very hard to not stop it and kept telling myself ""give it time and it will get better"". It never did.

I won't go in to the plot or anything else, other then to say, I was 100% disappointed and you could not pay me to watch this again...Loved the cast..but the movie simply stunk. Save your money...This is not worth $1 at a garage sale. I know others like it as many told me it was hilarious and I would love it....but as I said, it simply stunk in my opinion.

If AMZN would allow a ZERO star rating, I would give this ZERO stars. I would almost prefer to go scoop the poop out of the yard then to have to watch this again.

3624306,3,B001H5X7JS,"When a Hollywood spoof movie like ""Tropic Thunder,"" comes with a special directors cut, you know things are getting out of hand. What's next, a special directors cut of Catwoman? It's an amazingly self indulgent and superfluous offering for a rather forgettable comedy. The movie itself is already way too long at 2 hours, and to add another 20 minutes of material turns it into a bloat fest of stale action that crushes the life out of the best jokes. This movie should have been an hour and a half long, tops.

The theatrical version is not a bad comedy, if you like slap-stick, boundary pushing humor. There are some excellent moments in this movie; unfortunatly most of them take place in the first 3rd of the movie. The middle act sags, and if it wasn't for Robert Downy Jr., would be pure drudgery to get through. The last act is even more farcical than the first two, but manages to close well with the appearance of the excellently cast Matthew McConaughey who saves the day with a Tivo box... Made me laugh pretty hard. Tom Cruise also makes a cameo as a really whacked out movie producer with some serious issues (and a rap fetish!). Overall, a wonky cast of characters headed up by Stiller reprising every roll he's ever had. There's not much new from him here, but I stopped expecting anything new a long time ago.

On the positive side, Robert Downy Jr. steals the show as an Australian actor who puts a new spin on 'black face' and getting immersed in a roll. He's hysterically funny in some scenes, and I can't help wishing it was him, not the largely unfunny Stiller, who directed the movie. I think it would have been shorter, edgier, and overall a much better movie.

The theatrical version of the film gets 3 stars. The directors cut gets 2. Save your money and just get the theatrical version unless you just have to have another 20 minutes of Stiller indulging his ego... Better yet just buy ""Iron Man"" instead.",1229644800,,1932,4.545977011494253

3624309,4,B001H5X7JS,"Tropic Thunder is a truly funny movie. Great acting and incredible cinematography considering it's a comedy (even if it's an ""action-comedy""). But the esscence of this film is truly the huge send-up it throws to Hollywood. As the title of this review implies: The more you know and love Hollywood and all that comes with, the more you will enjoy this movie.

Of course, being a war film means the modern classics of this genre are all properly lampooned: Saving Private Ryan(Great gag at the first battle scene), Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Apocalypse Now are all represented. The fact that they went all out on the special effects and action just like in the ""real"" war films, really adds to the depth of the film as it can truly compete with the real films.

If this was just a war movie send-up, it would've been enough to achieve a fun movie but the movie REALLY shines when it pokes fun at Hollywood proper. From Nick Nolte playing the ""vet"" that wrote the book the movie is based on, to Matthew McConaughey as the Hollywood agent to Tom Cruise in a role that runs away with this movie. There is no mercy. Awards Shows, Over-the-Top Movie Trailers(The PERFECT beggining for this film), Prima Donna Actors on set and of course the Hollywood press are covered here.

Ben Stiller is perfect as the Stallone-like action hero looking for credibility. So is Robert Downey Jr. as the multiple Academy Award winner (his character takes more than a casual stab at Russell Crowe. Not just because he is Australian) Jack Black's character is hillarious and has one of the funniest lines in the film. Jay Baruchel plays the ""first time in the big leagues"" young actor(remember that Saving Private Ryan moment? Keep an eye on Baruchel) Brandon T. Jackson plays the product-pushing rapper who incidently has the best rapper name ever!

3624312,2,B001H5X7JS,"If Tropic Thunder were half as funny as it obviously thinks it is, then it might have been something special.  Despite the talent involved with this movie (Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Tom Cruise, etc.) it seems as though everyone involved knows how brilliantly talented and funny they are and how funny the premise is and all they have to do is show up and the movie will be great.  Uh...wrong.  You actually have to work at comedy...it's hard!

One of the main problems with the movie is that it is torn between what kind of comedy it wants to be.  Part of it wants to be a stinging criticism of the entire movie industry and the other half wants to be a shameless, raunchy comedy that will offend everyone.  It doesn't succeed on either front.  The satire of the movie feels dated and obvious.  Who doesn't know that Hollywood is full of self absorbed actors, ruthless studio heads and sleazy agents?  The part of the movie that wants to go for pure raunchiness and politically incorrect humor doesn't quite work because the movie's idea of this type of humor seems to be to use as much profanity as possible.  There's no inspired insanity behind all of the R rated shenanigans.  If the movie is trying to cash in on the post-Apatow comedy landscape, it seems to be missing the point.

Not that the movie is terrible.  There are some funny moments, some chuckles and grins, but no belly laughs.  The two key performances that have received rave reviews, Tom Cruise's heartless studio exec and Downey Jr's method actor aren't quite as brilliant as they've been made out to be.  Cruise, and a lot of critics, apparently thought that simply yelling and using profanity was comic gold.  I disagree.  As for Robert Downey Jr, his transformation into an African-American soldier is quite amazing, but only from a visual standpoint.  The character that Downey creates is mostly forgettable, just like most of this overblown and overhyped comedy.",1229385600,2,1956,4.736686390532545
3624313,5,B001H5X7JS,"This is a very funny movie that should tickle the funny-bone of fans of any war films, and any other comedy fans.  Ben Stiller proves himself as being a better director than his previous attempt with Zoolander and Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies of 2008.

We have a solid primary cast between Stiller, Black, and Downey Jr., but good old Robert Downey Jr. manages to steal most of the scenes from his co-stars as the white actor playing the black platoon sergeant (""I don't drop character until the DVD commentary"").

There are plenty of star cameos, but the best (and most unexpected) comes from Tom Cruise, who plays a foul-mouthed, fat corporate executive.  His cameo was originally intended to be kept a secret, but it was impossible to keep this appearance from leaking to the internet.  Let me tell you, this man may want to move into comedy considering his current negative status among the public.  He was SOLID in this movie.  I would have never expected Tom Cruise to pull a role like this, but he did and he actually was incredibly funny in most of his scenes.  The audience at my theater applauded when the credits showed his name.

Both Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise are qualified for the Golden Globe nominations!  Only reason I think Cruise wouldn't have a good chance over Downey Jr. is because of his little screen time, as opposed to Robert Downey Jr., who's present throughout most of the film. (Both were nominated for Best Supporting Actor in Comedy/Musical)

Other notable appearances are by Nick Nolte, as a Vietnam Veteran, and Matthew McConaughey as the Ben Stiller character's agent.  Tobey Maguire also makes a humorous appearance at the beginning of the film.

Overall I was tickled, and surprised by this very well-balanced cast of notable actors.  Every actor in here gets off some good jokes, and in different styles of comedy.  This film had lots of different types of jokes, ranging from parody, satire, drug addiction, slapstick, and just plain silly antics. This film had everyone in my audience laughing at one point or the other, through its many references.

I felt this redeemed a long string of horrifically bad American made parodies.  I never liked the work of Matt Stone and Parker with their shows such as `South Park', and don't even get me started on this `Disaster Movie' nonsense.  Only notable films I could spot were made by the Brits, with such brilliance as Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz.  Tropic Thunder isn't as good as those two films, mind you, but it certainly beats out all recent American made parodies.  I never felt offended, or attacked by this film.

Really, if you can't find the humor in a group of talented comedians (and one very talented dramatic actor) taking on Hollywood, one politically incorrect joke at a time, then maybe you shouldn't be watching movies.  Maybe you take life too seriously.

Maybe.

I will not say that `Tropic Thunder' is a perfect comedy, but in all honesty it is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time.  For the most part it is smartly written, and it is flawlessly acted (just give Robert Downey Jr. the Oscar now).  The film never lags and it never ceases to entertain.  My one complaint is that towards the middle of the film a lot of the jokes tend to feel a tad recycled, as if they are just circulating with the same joke just spoken a different way.  It's not constant and it doesn't last the entire length of the film (and Robert Downey Jr. especially works hard to make even the most regurgitated of jokes feel fresh) but it is there.

The film tells the story about a group of actors (the action hero, the corny comedian and the dramatic Oscar winner; or, in other words, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Russell Crowe) who are hired to film a film adaptation of a war veterans memoir.  The problem is that the actors are having a bit of trouble connecting with the script.  That is when the director decides to drop them off in the middle of the jungle and just film raw footage of them roughing it.  The problem is that the actors don't know that what is happening around them isn't part of the movie, so when their director explodes they think it is some really cool special effects, and when the films star Tugg Speedman is kidnapped he thinks it is all part of the movie.  Thankfully Kirk Lazarus (the white method actor who's died his skin black for the movie) is a little smarter than everyone else.

Hollywood is definitely ripped a new one here, but the fact of the matter is that it is funny because it's so true (not to this extreme, but come one, this is one accurate satire).  The stereotypical depictions are about as extreme as Hollywood likes to paint them to be, and that adds weight to the films message.  The performances by both Downey and Cruise (both Golden Globe nominees!!!) are surely the most controversial in the bunch, but also the most enjoyable.  They attack their characters with fervor and dedication.  They are having a great time, but they are also taking their performances seriously, and this shines through in their presence.

I've heard a few people complain that they didn't get a black actor to play a black man.  That is the whole point of the comedy here.  That dispute is even had within the film itself (the hilarious Brandon T. Jackson's character Alpa obviously has a major problem with Kirk being cast in the `black' role).  To attack the film for that decision is to either not have seen the film or merely not have understood it.

Find something legit to gripe over.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, from start to finish.  It could have used a little fine tuning with some of the jokes, but the delivery is there every time so it makes up for it.  The action is there, the wit is there and the performances are spot on.  Jack Black is actually really funny here, and Ben Stiller manages to take his typical comedic timing and kick it up a notch, standing out even alongside the films VIP Robert Downey Jr.

I'd give the film a solid B+, but the acting is a definite A+.

Be forewarned; the film is designed to offend you.  It is littered (especially from Downey and Cruise) with profanities, and they attack every Hollywood stereotype from race relations to mental handicaps (""full retard"") and they show no hesitation nor do they make any apologies.  This is a film that is as blunt and as shameless as they come, but that's just all the more reason to love it.",1229040000,5,3871,4.4871428571428575
3624325,4,B001H5X7JS,"Tropic Thunder: a kind-of documentary about the making of a war movie called....Tropic Thunder. I'd heard this was a pretty good movie, but I just couldn't believe it was worth a move to the top of my viewing queue. Well...albeit late to the party almost a month after its release on Blu Ray...Tropic Thunder surprised me in several ways.

First and most important...this movie was really good! Too often these days comedies aren't funny; in fact most lean towards stupidity rather than genuine humor. Tropic Thunder's deliberately over the top performances, combined with well-done satire and good writing, will keep a smile on your face from start to finish.

The next surprise came in the form of surprise performances and cameos. The cameos were expected, because Ben Stiller always has them in his movies. But the biggest surprise was the actor in the role of Tropic Thunder's studio head, a brash,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ari-Gold-like/dp/B0007QS324/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ari Gold-like</a>&nbsp;character...it stole the show. Hilarious.

Actually, now that I think about it, that studio head role was just one of many hilarious performances in the movie. Stiller and Jack Black were great at spoofing spoiled actors. Robert Downey Jr and his politically incorrect portrayal of an African American was comical...especially the way his character was received by fellow African American actor Brandon T. Jackson.

Tropic Thunder  was a very good, funny movie. Thoroughly entertaining.

My wife hated this film by the way, and it's definitely not for everyone - but if you have a sense of humor, you'll like it.

Rather than re-hash the plot, I'd like to quote my favorite parts without giving anything away:

- Tom Cruise as the Producer (Les Grossman) is in his best role ever. Forget Born on the Fourth of July or any of that serious stuff, this is pure gold. Basically, none of the quotes are clean enough for Amazon, but there's a good summary on IMDB here [...]. Essentially one of the best dialog roles since Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket.

- The entire subplot about actors who depict mentally challenged characters in order to get Oscars is pure genius. It's a shame this was seen as offensive since the fun is being poked (savagely) at Hollywood rather than people with disabilities. The Simple Jack character is a masterful blend of Rain Man, Forrest Gump and I Am Sam.

- Robert Downney Jr's scenes are all downright hilarious (the ""you people"" scene was great). He's one of the most talented actors around these days, and it's uncanny how he can play Russell Crowe playing ""Kirk Lazarus"".

Needless to say, this is one for the DVD collection. There's a saggy 20 minutes towards the end that slows the pace a little but otherwise it's pretty much non-stop laughs all the way.",1228348800,2,1497,4.550185873605948

After the director meets and untimely death the cast of actors can't figure out if all this is just a set up, or if they really should be scared for their lives.

3624338,1,B001H5X7JS,"""Tropic Thunder,"" the movie critics darling from the summer of 2008, suffers from the massive sin of being slightly amusing and painfully disappointing (once you've seen the trailer there's no reason to see the rest).

Critics drooled all over it because Director Ben Stiller skewers Hollywood insiders and there's nothing that movie critics fawn over more than a movie that savages directors, actors, agents, and filmmaking (because they all secretly hate the business). Besides, the critics can actually understand the in-jokes.

The movie was a huge marketing success - web sites, viral videos, and a massive push by ""insiders."" It raked in more than $110 million to qualify for blockbuster status. The hype was that ""Tropic Thunder"" was raw and controversial (mental health advocates gave the film an enormous boost when they protested against the depiction of mentally-handicapped people in the film).

Unfortunately, ""Tropic Thunder"" is an overhyped dud done in by a lame plot, variety show quality gags, and the seriously defective acting of one Ben Stiller. And the supposedly no-holds barred gags? Saturday Night Live is more controversial.

Here's the concept: a group of self-absorbed A-list actors are filming a Vietnam movie. Losing control of the movie, the director decides to take his pampered actors into jungle for some guerilla filming. A landmine kills the director and the actors - left on their own - are attacked by real drug-dealing rebels (and think the action is part of the script).

Bored yet?

The plot, of course, only works if the characters are idiots - which they are.
Stiller has the acting range of a turnip. Like his character in ""Zoolander,"" who uses the same pursed-lip expression in all of his photo shoots, Stiller plays the same character over and over and over again. He's the Groundhog Day of actors.
This time Stiller plays washed up action star Tugg Speedman (a cross between Rambo and Tom Cruise). He's hopelessly insecure and utters dialog like: ""Somebody said they were close to me?"" And, of course, he pouts like only Stiller can pout.

Every time Stiller is on screen is a grating experience. You want to scream: ""Stop the madness!"" at the top of your lungs.

Robert Downey Jr. fairs better as the Oscar winning method actor Kirk Lazarus. Lazarus has a skin pigmentation process so he can play a black sergeant - and is completely in-character throughout the film. Unfortunately, the role limits Downey's maniac comedic skills - and he ends up being a one-trick pony. The gag is funny - for about five minutes.

Then there is Jack Black, who is completely wasted as the drug-addicted ""fat"" comedian. The role is a clich wrapped in a stereotype and delivered as a typecast. He actually bites a bat in half because it ""stole"" his drugs and is thrown half-naked over a water buffalo. Cheap gimmickry at its finest.

But the real problem with ""Tropic Thunder"" is the stupidity of the plot. Nothing makes sense. Once the actors get in the jungle, the film plays like a series of skits cobbled together with duct tape. It's hard to watch without that sinking feeling in your belly that you have been duped.

The real pain here? ""TopicLink Thunder"" was so successful that it will probably spawn a sequel.

I went into this expecting a lame spoof movie, but instead I saw one of the best comedies that has come a long for a very long time. If you're tired of the drivel from the ""Not Another Teen Movie/Meet the Spartans"" bunch, don't worry-- this is NOTHING like that! It's actually FUNNY, SMART and ENTERTAINING.

I am no fan of Tom Cruise-- it's nothing personal; I've just never liked anything he's done... but I LOVED his performance as Les Grossman! At times I forgot Robert Downey Jr. wasn't black.

3624342,4,B001H5X7JS,"Tropic Thunder is one of the best movies of 2008 that I had a ball watching. There are some of Hollywood's best actors in Tropic Thunder to include Robert Downey Jr., who is nearly unrecognizable as Australian actor, Kirk Lazarus, playing African American, Sgt. Osiris, where he has dyed his skin dark and doesn't break away from the character throughout the whole movie. Everyone has talked about Heath Ledger's incredible and mind blowing role as The Joker in The Dark Knight, but Robert Downey Jr. also deserves a lot of praise, and a possible Oscar award nomination for best acting in this role. Surprisingly, Tom Cruise steps out of his comfort zone playing a fat, balding, cursing, movie studio executive, Les Grossman, who steals every scene he is in. Also along for this crazy ride is Jack Black, a drug addicted comedy actor, and Matthew McConaughey, who plays Ben Stiller's agent, and is extremely funny as he is gorgeous. I usually find Ben Stiller a bit annoying in his roles, but here he perfectly embodies the role he is playing, Tugg Speedman, a washed up action star.

Tropic Thunder is about making a movie based on the Vietnam War. The director, Steve Coogan is fed up with his whiny, egotistical actors, and with the help of Nick Nolte, who plays the Vietnam vet the movie is based on, drop the actors in the middle of the jungle to fend for themselves. That is where the fun really begins. Jack Black runs out of heroin, or jelly beans as he calls them, and starts going through detox. Plus, the actors find themselves in the territory of a heroin-producing Vietcong gang, but don't think any of that is real because they still think they are filming the movie.

There are not many comedies like Tropic Thunder that can make me laugh so hard that my stomach hurts. There are also some shockingly funny scenes such as Ben Stiller killing a panda bear and wearing the panda head on his own head because he has gone crazy ala Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.

Or the conversation Kirk and Tugg have about why Forest Gump and Rain Man did so well for those actors playing mentally handicapped roles, but because Ben played a role where he went full out ""retard"", it was meant to bomb:

Kirk Lazarus: Everybody knows you never go full retard.
Tugg Speedman: What do you mean?
Kirk Lazarus: Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, 'Rain Man,' look retarded, act retarded, not retarded. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic, sho'. Not retarded. You know Tom Hanks, 'Forrest Gump.' Slow, yes. Retarded, maybe. Braces on his legs. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded. Peter Sellers, ""Being There."" Infantile, yes. Retarded, no. You went full retard, man. Never go full retard. You don't buy that? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, ""I Am Sam."" Remember? Went full retard, went home empty handed...

And of course the way Robert played his role of the Sergeant so perfectly to the point he began to think he truly is a black man lost in the jungle:

Kirk Lazarus: I know what dude I am. I'm the dude playin' the dude, disguised as another dude!
Kirk Lazarus: Man, I don't drop character 'till I done the DVD commentary.

*This is true because I listened to the dvd commentary, and Robert made sure to stay in his role as Osiris*

Tropic Thunder may not be a masterpiece of filmmaking but it is one movie you can have such a great time watching.

""Tropic Thunder"" stays on a tight leash, filling moments with satirical jabs at both the films in the genre but at the actors themselves. Robert Downey's ""blacker-than-you"" transformation from a Russell Crowe bad-boy to Richard Roundtree/Fred Williamson blaxploitation star takes stabs at method acting (""I don't break character until after the DVD commentary!"") and are the funniest in the movie. But there's nothing more outrageous than Tom Cruise, head shaved and body latexed, as an obnoxious studio head. He steals every scene he pops up in and reminds us all just how effective an actor he is when he isn't jumping up and down on TV couches.

Although I currently get most of my movies from a popular online rental service, I will buy the ones I enjoy and/or think I'll watch more than once.

Well, after all the hype about Tropic Thunder I came close to purchasing this movie sight unseen. It looked hysterical in the previews and friends who saw it said it was hilarious. Boy am I glad that I got it as a rental first because it was not at all what I expected and to tell you the truth I was kind of disappointed in it. From the reviews, and from what people had said about the movie, I expected it to be much funnier and less serious than it turned out to be. I think I was expecting ""Stripes"" 2008 and I was shocked when I didn't even chuckle during the first half hour. In fact the first seen was so disgusting that I almost turned the movie off. The reproduction of gore for accuracy, as in Private Ryan, is bearable but the reproduction of war-related gore in an attempt at humor is completely unnecessary and in this case disgusting.

So, I thought ""it's a slow starter"" but it never did get what I consider truly funny. In addition, I must've missed the ""slap-stick"" that other reviewers have mentioned. Finally, to compare it to Blazing Saddles is so much of a stretch it's unbelievable. Tropic Thunder is not in any way similar to the afforementioned gut-busting Mel Brooks film. To me, I would classify it more as an action film with a dab of humor thrown into the mix. I expected a lot more from what I'd heard and from Ben Stiller.

Tropic Thunder fails, only insofar as it falls short of all its ambitions, and in failing it is still one of the most original and audacious comedies of the past few years. There is so much to love about this movie: the writing, acting and execution of Robert Downey's character is fantastic. Tom Cruise is not only everything he needs to be for the satire to work so savagely, but his playing against type in the makeup he has to wear for the part...well, love the man or hate him, he is one hell of a movie actor!

 There are no war movie cliches left standing and the pretensions of ""method actors"" are hilariously skewered in the courageous presentation of Downey's ""white-guy-trying-to be-Black"" Sargeant and Stiller's ""I am Sam"" satire.

I was on the fence about Ben Stiller, but this movie has made me a fan. The bravely non-PC in your face outrageousness of this film is refreshing, even when it doesn't quite work as humour. The only negatives I found were the mis- (under?-) use of Jack Black in a poorly written role and the anti-climacitc and formulaic ending. Stiller is trying to keep one too many satirical balls in the air, so the result does sometimes seem unfocused and the ending a bit tacked on and forced.

Jay Baruchel, Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey and Steve Coogan deserve special mention, particulalry Baruchel for being the ""straight man"" who highlights the over-the-top antics of the prima donna actors.

As an avid watcher of films such as Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, etc., I could not help but notice the crazy pastiche and satire. From start to finnish, this film is hillarious. Bravo to Mr. Stiller.

As a postscript, I think if there were any justice in this world that Robert Downey Jr. would win the Oscar for his amazing performance. His acting is absolutely brilliant. Honestly, Heath Ledger's Joker has nothing on Downey's Lazarus.

Brilliant!",1227484800,2,936,4.955414012738854
3624355,4,B001H5X7JS,"TROPIC THUNDER is finally Ben Stiller's moment to rise out of the ashes of bad comedy. Here he has virtually redeemed himself as a funny person. It is evident he put a lot of passion and thought into this film, backed by a huge budget, which, without the big budget, this film would have lost its meaning.

Although I believe that Stiller has almost redeemed himself, he is still a crappy actor, and as a comedian himself, he is never funny as he over plays his roles where he is just a caricature of himself.

There are 2 real gems in this film, and neither of them are comedians: Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. Downey Jr as the black man in the film takes his role so seriously, that to not believe him would mean you did not enjoy the film. His mannerisms and tonality throughout is spot on, that you could not help laugh at everything he does. Just hilarious! Tom Cruise takes his role to new levels. He can sink into a few bad films - and they are bad because he takes his roles too seriously. This looked like he was having tons of fun playing Les Grossman is so over the top that you have to be in awe of his acting range. But his exaggeration is pitch perfect! I don't know anyone else who could have done it better. Watch him dance!

Jack Black, the second billing of the movie, I felt his talents were completely wasted. Which is too bad. Of all the big names in this film, the chemistry seemed to work so well. Black was definitely working well with the group, but his role was of little ultimate use and his comedy was marred by his drug addicted character. I don't feel it was necessary and it was not really funny. Because he was fixated on drugs, it seemed he had no other relationship with the people and so the humor was reduced to base biological cliches.

Two other honorable mentions of course is Jay Baruchel, who is a great geeky type person who fits perfectly as the scared young kid, but provides the sanity for the group of egotistical big named actors working together. And Brandon Jackson as 'Alpo Chino'. What a great name. And I loved his commercials in the beginning of the flick for 'Bust'a'Nut' energy bar. Awesome stuff!

TROPIC THUNDER was written by Ben Stiller and Justin Theroux (Mulholland Drive) and together they have written a great comedy that can offer repeated viewings. I gave the film 4 stars because of some minor issues I had with the film, namely Stiller. His career, I think, would serve him so much better out of the way of the camera, and instead, stepping back to write and direct. His serious and always angry style that is so prevalent in just about every comedy is way overdone and was never funny to begin with because he could never write well enough for himself. When he did write for himself, it was usually an inflated role that served himself and not the film. So I say, step out of the way Ben, you are not the star.

In sum, the film is definitely recommended to all. Yeah, there is lots of swearing and even some gore in the beginning. The racial issues are all part of the comedy and should not be taken seriously.

Other celebrities who makes their way into the film are Matthew McConaughey, Christine Taylor (naturally, Ben Stiller's wife), Nick Nolte, and a lot of celebs who play themselves. Just a great, fun film that will keep you laughing for the entire ride!",1227398400,9,3336,4.414634146341464
3624356,2,B001H5X7JS,"There's no doubt that Tropic Thunder is one of the funniest movies of the year- if not THE funniest movie of the year. I remember seeing in the theater and laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. I was excited when I found out that there was an unrated DC coming out... 2 discs, and 15 more minutes more footage.

However, as much as I gotta say the movie rocks, I have to say: BUY THE THEATRICAL CUT INSTEAD. The unrated version slows the movie down a bit, and most of the added stuff doesn't seem to fit in. They changed some funny lines, and even took some out as well. In fact some of the added stuff makes the movie feel a lot longer than it really is, and after awhile the movie seems repetitive, which is one of the few things that killed the movie for me.

So if you're planning on buying the DVD, get the single disc rated version instead... this movie is definitely one of the funniest I've seen, and I definitely look forward to owning it, but really, just get the theatrical. It's MUCH better.",1227225600,329,1002,4.268421052631579
3624357,4,B001H5X7JS,"This movie certainly is not for everyone.  It starts out very promising with some very funny ""fake"" trailers.  Then the squirming begins.  This movie funny, but it isn't a laugh out loud, tears streaming down your face funny.  It's more of a ""Oh my gosh, I can't believe they just did that"" snicker.  You almost feel bad for watching it because you will find things humorous that you somehow feel you shouldn't, but you will smile anyways.  I personally found it to be entertaining and I bought the Blu-Ray even after seeing it in theaters so it wasn't a blind buy.  It's one of those movies that I will enjoy watching with others just to see how they react.  For most people, I would say this is a rental unless you catch a good deal, but you should make the effort to see it.  The performances are great and this has become only the second movie that I have enjoyed Robert Downey Jr in, with Iron Man being the first.  Jack Black was the only character that I really didn't like for most of the movie.  I just wanted to watch him in ""The Fatties"" which is his characters money maker.  Anyways, again, it's a solid rental, but if your thing is comedy, action and a lot of uncomfortableness, then go ahead and buy it.  It looks and sounds great on Blu-Ray and you might end up liking it like me.",1227225600,,1295,4.323651452282157
3624358,3,B001H5X7JS,"I wish that studios would release the theatrical versions, rather than the extended versions, of their movies onto DVD and keep the once-deleted scenes as deleted scenes in the Special Features section of the disc.

That said, I must admit that I laughed-out-loud several times while watching TROPIC THINDER, now available as a 2-disc ""Director's Cut"" from DreamWorks Home Entertainment.  However, I think I would have enjoyed the movie  much more if the producers had not inserted approximately 15 minutes of scenes that had been cut from the theatrical release.  That extra footage slowed the film's pace considerably and I found myself checking my watch before the movie's halfway point.

Directed, co-written by and starring Ben Stiller, TROPIC THUNDER is a very clever send-up of Hollywood, filmmakers and war movies, like PLATOON.  Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black play primo dona actors who are starring in a war movie being shot on location in Vietnam.  Stiller is a fading action star, Downey is a 5-time Oscar winner and Black stars in gross-out comedies.

When the filming falls a month behind schedule after only  five days of shooting, director Steve Coogan decides to take his cast further ""in country,"" in order to get more realism.  Unfortunately, events don't go quite as planned and the actors find themselves up against an army of deadly heroin dealers.

A barely recognizable Tom Cruise, as the picture's producer, and Matthew McConaughey as Stiller's agent, nearly steal the movie from the stars.

DVD extras include audio commentaries, multiple ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes and deleted scenes.

3624361,4,B001H5X7JS,"I have been writing reviews for movies since 1970, back when I was on my college newspaper.  I have seen some great movies, and by ""great movies,"" I mean movies like CASABLANCA, GONE WITH THE WIND and CITIZEN KANE.  TROPIC THUNDER isn't in their league, but it is a GREAT movie, nonetheless. Funny on one level.  Crude on another.  A satire about the movie industry on still another level.  It's like APOCALYPSE NOW and NETWORK rolled together for the 21st Century.

The acting centers around excellent performances by Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Barachel, and Brandon T. Jackson as solders in a Vietnam War movie who, due to cost overruns (after 5 days the movie is already one month behind schedule) are taken by the director to the jungles of Vietnam where it is to be shot ""gorilla"" style, ala BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.

While all of the performances, including the strong support performances by Danny R. McBride and Nick Nolte, are terrific, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as five-time Oscar Award winning Australian actor Kirk Lasarus is phenomenal. Lasarus is so immersed in his craft that he undergoes a pigmentation alteration procedure operation to make him look like an African-American, and true to his craft, he declares that he remains in character until the DVD commentary is finished (which he actually did, as you will discover if you listen to the actor's commentary).

In addition to outstanding comic scenes, action scenes, and satirical scenes, the interplay between black actor Brando T. Jackson as Alpa Chino and Robert Downey Jr., as Lasurus, is hilarious, but frankly the interplay between all of the actors is outstanding.  The screenplay written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Ethan Cohen should win an Oscar.

SPOILER ALERT FOR JUST THIS PARAGRAPH: If there is any weakness in the Blu-Ray version, and the two-disk ""Director's Cut""  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tropic-Thunder-Unrated-Director-s-Cut/dp/B001H5X7JS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tropic Thunder)  (Unrated Director's Cut)</a>&nbsp;DVD's by director Ben Stiller, is that the extra 14 minutes in the ""Director's Cut"" does not really add much to the movie.  In comparing the two versions, you see an extra snippet here and there, such as when Ben Stiller is asked by his agent Rick Peck, played terrifically by Matthew McConaughey, how the adoption is going, and we see Stiller looking for five-seconds at a 2-year old Vietnam boy with a real ninja knife in his hands, guarded by two burly bodyguards.  Or, an actor saying something in one version, and something else in the other version (as when Stiller says to Downey in the opening scene in the director's cut, ""When we get back, I'm going to teach you how to juggle,"" versus ""When we get back, I'm going to teach you how to play the piano"" in the R-rated version.) In the first instance, the 5-second glance at the adopted boy, if added to the movie would have made the scene at the end showing Stiller going back to stay with the boy even funnier.  In the second instance, it is a toss-up as to which one is funnier.  END OF SPOILER ALERT.

When these ""Director's Versions"" first cropped-up, it was usually because the studio wanted the movie a certain length and cuts had to be made and good scenes deleted.  However, now it just seems the ""Director's Version"" is used as another opportunity to sell the same movie to the public.  To me, and Director Ben Stiller noted several times in the ""Director's Version"" commentary, these ""extras"" were cut to make the theater version tighter, and this shows because the theater version flows better.  I wish we could have had both version on the Blu-Ray disc in addition to the great ""extras.""

BTW, I found it interesting that at a local store I noticed the ""R-Rated Version"" could not be purchased by anyone under 17, but the ""Director's Version"" could be bought by anyone, regardless of age.

Speaking of the actor's commentary that accompanies all of the DVD versions, it is terrific, especially Robert Downey Jr. as he remains in character during his comments about the movie, just as he said he does in the movie dialogue.  The Blu-Ray disc has a few more extras than the double DVD version for approximately the same price, but its picture is so much better, so I would recommend the Blu-Ray version over the double DVD version if you have both types of players.

I would be remiss to not mention one other performance, and that is the one given by Tom Cruise as the megalomaniac Hollywood producer.  His make-up was so good that in the theater when I saw the movie, I did not recognize that it was Tom Cruise playing the part.

TROPIC THUNDER is not a movie for everyone, but if heavy doses of profanity and some grotesque scenes are not too upsetting, you will find it very funny and maybe even thought provoking.  Whatever the case, it provides the viewer with some great water cooler fodder.",1227052800,8,4945,4.933655006031363

It features supporting roles by Matthew McConaughey, Tom Cruise, Steve Coogan, Bill Hader, and cameos by others.  It was written by Stiller, Justin Theroux, and Etan Cohen, and was directed by Stiller.

We got that out of the way?  Good.  Because here's the deal: ""Tropic Thunder"" is funny.  And smart.  How often do these go together, nowadays?  They used to, back when Mel Brooks was running the show, and it's popped up again here and there, with ""Knocked Up,"" ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall.""  But ""Tropic Thunder"" has something all those movies don't: A point.  The message isn't just about Hollywood, either; it's something about all of us, who pretend to be what we aren't.  It's human nature to make believe; it's human nature to give into those beliefs and think they're real.

Okay.  Enough philosophy.  I'm putting my soap box away.  ""Tropic Thunder"" is absolutely gut-bustingly hilarious.  It's also highly offensive, crude, and over-the-top; there are jokes that go to far, there are jokes that don't go far enough.  Such is the nature of comedy.  My point is, even the few jokes that fall flat serve to make the rest of the movie all the better.  And it doesn't hurt that the film evokes the best from its three headliners: Stiller has never been funnier (I'm not a huge fan of his, but I have to say, the man approaches, in this film, something akin to comedic genius); Jack Black, likewise, is in top form (again, I'm not a big fan; but here, he's absolutely terrific); and Downey is, simply a wonder to behold.  With all due respect to the rest of the cast and crew: This film would not be what it is without Downey's presence.  It's not that he's portraying ""a dude disguised as a dude pretending to be another dude"" (in this case, a white Australian actor playing an African American); it's that he portrays it so eloquently.  You never doubt his authenticity, a method actor so lost in his role that he doesn't drop character until after he does the DVD commentary.  The entire cast is hilarious; Downey is also thoughtful and intriguing.

""Tropic Thunder"" is not for the faint of heart, or those who like their jokes clean, or those who like their movies without much thought put into them (if ""Norbit"" is your idea of classic comedy, please leave now).  ""Tropic Thunder"" is a comedy with equal parts heart and cojones.  It'll rock you out of your seat (especially with it's seventies rock soundtrack).  It'll make you laugh 'til you wet yourself.

3624375,5,B001H5X7JS,"""Tropic Thunder"" comes out guns blazing.  Explosions, gunfire, helicopters crashing...seems like another war movie.  That is until you realize that what you are actually watching, is a parody of ""Platoon"".  The concept behind ""Tropic Thunder"" is interesting and refreshingly original.

Three big name actors and a rapper are in the process of filming ""Tropic Thunder"", the real life account of a Vietnam Vet by the name of Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte).  The cast for said movie includes the fart-happy comedian/drug addict Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), the washed up action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), the multi talented, multi award winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and the every other word is an expletive rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson).

When their director (Steve Coogan) feels he is dealing with a bunch of prima donnas, a crazy idea is thought up.  Let's drop these actors in a real war zone and film their movie ""guerilla style.""  The actors are then forced to become the soldiers they are portraying and battle real life guerilla soldiers.

""Tropic Thunder"" is straight up, hardcore R-rated comedy.  Will it offend people?  Probably.  But, be objective and you'll laugh hysterically.  There are many funny moments in ""Tropic Thunder"" and the performances alone make the film worth watching, especially Downey's.  It's a big budget action/war/comedy that was pulled off extremely well.  If you want some, I highly recommend you go get some.",1226361600,3,1467,5.182978723404255

The movie centers around a group of actors sent to Vietnam to film a war movie about a soldier (Nick Nolte, looking like... well, his mugshot), who lost his hands in a rescue mission while saving his buddies. Each of actors comes equiped with a massive ego and soon the director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), has lost all control of of the film. After a serious chewing-out by his boss, a barely recognizable and hilarious Tom Cruise, he takes his men out into the jungle and leaves them there, planning to film them using a bunch of minicams.

Then he steps on a mine.

The rest of the movie consists of the cast, led by Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr, in his second great role of the year), planning a method actor who in no way resembles Russell Crowe, washed-up action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller, who also directed), and Jack Black as an actor who has made his career doing fart-joke movies and is addicted to just about every drug knowns to man, trying to get their way out of the jungle.

It's a simple enough description for the film, but it doesn't even begin to touch on the genius in the movie, which is preceeded by several trailers and an add for a fake energy drink peddled by a rapper, Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), who is trying to use the film as a way to break into a new industry.

The film is very clever about Hollywood, featuring a great scene between Tugg Speedman's agent, played by Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruises' character, as well, as the wonderful fake trailers, and plenty of commentary on what it takes to win an Oscar (""You never go full-retard,"" advises Robert Downey Jr's character).

Overall a great film, and one I'd recommend to just about anyone!",1226016000,2,1878,4.541420118343195
3624378,5,B001H5X7JS,This is the only truly funny movie that Stiller has done since meet the Fockers. but To his respect this movie had me rolling the whole time. I actually pee'd a little. Even Tom Cruise Made me laugh and i usually sleep through his movies,1226016000,2,237,4.288888888888889
3624379,5,B001H5X7JS,"This movie is so friggin' brilliant that most people don't get that it's Hollywood actors making fun of Hollywood actors and all the drama that is a part of their lives. The ""trailers"" at the beginning? I have not been in a theatre where people have laughed that hard and loud since.....well I don't know when. I actually really, really, really want to see 'Satan's Alley'!!! Those who've seen TT know what this is. And everyone has said it but it's true.....Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is a revelation. I never knew he could do comedy like this. ""The scene is about emotionality"". ""You went full retard. You never go full retard"". ""Ain't no cell phones in 1969 man, I'm head to toe legit"". Brilliant! And Tom Cruise won back a lot of people with his performance in this movie I think. The whole thing is just so no holds barred that you can't help but revel in how fun it is. If you are some oversensitive politically correct wacko, stay away. If you enjoy comedy and if you can appreciate a smart comedy masquerading as a stupid comedy, then this will have you rolling and repeating lines and then giggling about it for days afterward.",1225929600,,1141,4.570731707317073
3624380,5,B001H5X7JS,"Okay, first off let's get right down to the brass-tacks.  If you don't like crude or morally contradicting humor - this movie is ""FOR SURE"" not going to please you.  Bible-thumpers & mentally-challenged sensitive individuals need not read any further.  For those of you who look for movies that are breaking new ground with offensive & `out of line' material ""FOR SURE"" this movie is for you.

For the first time in a `really' long time, I found myself wanting to rewind the whole movie and watch it again right after my first viewing.  I'm not even that big of a Ben Stiller fan, and I was completely overtaken with shock and awe used with the humor in Tropic Thunder.  Sure, I liked Zoolander and found a lot of the humor from that film, throughout this one; however I'm also a big fan of Robert Downey Jr.  I grew up with R.D. on the silver screen and so desperately wanted the man to pull out of the rehab press releases so he could come back with some more of his old-school radical humor.  Hands down Downey Jr. stole the film and in my opinion has now topped every other comedic role he's ever done (thus far).

Though Jack Black doesn't get to let lose with his normal off the wall shock-humor, he makes up for it with some of the best whack-job scene's associated with this genre of spoofing.  It's not very often that a military style spoof movie comes out and for sure this was an example of perfect casting to keep the audiences laughing.

Leave your brain at the door and get ready to laugh `a lot'.  I also had a lot of fun picking out the different spoofs that were portrayed within the movie. Oh and one last item.  I completely `hate' Tom Cruise; literally, there's no way I can express in words how much his presence on the silver screen turns my stomach.  In his role in Tropic Thunder, he's completely changed my attitude 100%.  The cameo's & surprise supporting actors fills out the fun of the movie - don't think - just see this movie.",1225756800,3,1957,4.397222222222222
3624381,5,B001H5X7JS,"I love parodies, any kind, I take em in, hoping to get a few laughs, but lately, I've been a little dissapointed. After Scary Movie hit the scene with its 'So Obivious You'd Be Stupid Not To See Them' parodies, the flood gates opened, alowing any two bit throwback script to be green lighted if it poked fun at a well thought out movie (I'm looking at you Meet the Spartans). Stiller (director) takes a more subliminal spoof in Tropic Thunder, but this isen't full of just movie references, it's the whole industry of Hollywood. The outdated action hero, the chain blinging rapper, the totally funny-but-messed-up comidian, and shows what goes on behind closed doors, as well as taking pot-shots at Stallone, Murphy and Nelly.

 The story is origonal, and extremly simple: put actors in a real time war zone. Simple? Yes. Funny? Extremly. This could've turned out into a campy war spoof, with over used catch-phrases and washed up actors, but  Ben Stiller injectes with 3x the laughter, with new takes on Steve-O and Vietnam vets that will have you doubled over on more than one occasion. Stiller, Downey Jr. and Black give killer renditions of celebs, (and even have Tom Cruise hidden in the cast dosen't hurt) and as you could imagine, they act out great. The one who really stood out to me though has Danny McBride, fresh off the set of Pineapple Express, Danny comes to play the role of a demolition man, with his preformance, I was wondering why he didn't headline the movie.

 Tropic Thunder is THE summer comidy. It is, I'm not exaggerating either, the best comidy of the year, maybe even the last 5.",1225584000,,1607,4.684397163120567
3624382,5,B001H5X7JS,Best movie I have seen this year .....nuff said.....oh erm just behind The Dark Knight of course.  It is so funny without resorting to stupid slapstick and antics (heres looking at you Zohan).  It is definitely the thinking man's comedy.  Highly recommended.,1225497600,,258,5.095238095238095
3624383,4,B001H5X7JS,"Many months ago, when I first heard the concept behind TROPIC THUNDER, and the names of the cast members, my interest was certainly quite high...but so was my expectation of disappointment. So often, movies with great concepts fail to execute well (good example, HANCOCK).

The concept: a group of film stars are working on a Vietnam combat film, based on a true story about a brave rescue of a POW. Little do the bickering, clueless actors know, but they've been spotted by a group of REAL jungle drug-lords, who believe this group of American soldiers are REAL DEA agents coming for them. Suddenly, these whiny actors find out exactly how useless their guns full of blanks are!

The cast: Ben Stiller (who also directed the film) as a fading action superstar, Jack Black as a grade Z gross-out comedian eager to stretch his horizons in a serious film (but also dealing with some major drug use issues of his own), Brandon Jackson as a rapper trying to add another line of work to his growing list of achievements and most notably, Robert Downey Jr as Kirk Lazarus a multi-Oscar-winning Australian method actor who has undergone extensive plastic surgery in order to play the African-American sergeant of the team. Also along are Steve Coogan as their director, Jay Baruchel as a young, up-and-coming actor who may the only person in the group with a clue, Danny McBride as their explosives expert and Nick Nolte as the old Vietnam vet whose story they are telling.

The result?: I'm happy to say that overall, this movie is a SMASHING success. As with any action heavy comedy, there are moments when the comedy flags and the action doesn't thrill enough to make up for it...but overall, Stiller and company have very successfully made this film and its high concept work!!

The movie is packed full of ""inside"" jokes about method acting, Oscar-baiting performances, rap artists who shill for their own products (Jackson plays the rapper Alpo-Chino who is trying to work in references to his new energy drink ""Booty Sweat"" into this Nam epic), etc., etc. I guess if this was the first movie you'd seen in ten years, you'd miss half the jokes. But if you're an avid filmgoer, TROPIC THUNDER is rich with snide digs at the film industry. And best of all, we have Tom Cruise as the most foul-mouthed, obnoxious studio head in history. He's funny indeed, although the character is actually not all that funny...it's mostly amusing to be in on the joke of a fat, bald, excessively hairy Tom Cruise dancing to rap music and swearing like he's in a Tarentino flick. Matthew McConaghy shows up as Stiller's agent, and he's funnier than I've seen him in five years (or perhaps ever).

I suppose I could go on and on about the various ""bits"" in the film...but let me just touch on a couple of high points. First of all, be sure NOT to be late for the film. It begins, without warning, with a series of fake movie trailers featuring our various stars in various ridiculous films. These are fall on the floor funny, and set up the 4 main characters very neatly indeed for us. This is followed by a very high budget Vietnam action sequence which manages to make fun of pretty much all Vietnam movie clichs in about 4 minutes. Best of all is Stiller's over-the-top reenactment of Willem Dafoe's death scene in PLATOON. I also enjoyed the unbelievable (and unbelievably silly) gore of these scenes. They poke hilarious fun at how war movies have become so much about showing us the damage grenades, bullets and shrapnel do to the human body. These early moments put me on such a high of hilarity that my goodwill towards the film allowed me to coast over the slower moments with minimal unhappiness.

Also, Robert Downey has received lots of attention for his role. Here's a serious American actor playing a super-serious Australian actor (with the most piercing blue eyes!) whose playing a serious caricature of a black army sergeant in the Vietnam era. It's a boldly tasteless choice, and Downey nails it. He makes fun of self-important, showy acting AND Hollywood's deaf ear towards stereotypes in one fell swoop. His interactions with Alpo-Chino, who really IS black, are hilarious. What a summer Downey has had!!

What about the less than wonderful things? There aren't too many. I'd say that Jack Black fares least well of the bunch. His character is the wildest and most unhinged of the group, and this allows Black to coast on just being manic far too often. Everyone is a TYPE...but Black shows little humanity below that surface. Also, the action sequences near the end of the film make little sense...once again, these bad guys apparently couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with all their machine guns. How many films rely on the villains being bad shots?!?! I think it would have been possible to actually make us feel these actors were in real danger. (Although the FINAL action scene manages to be explosive and funny at the same time.) And, while not a criticism of the film per se, I think it's time for Stiller to put away the dumb lug character: DODGEBALL, ZOOLANDER and now TROPIC THUNDER. It's funny, but now it is also very, very predictable, this character Stiller plays of the successful but extremely clueless schmuck.

Overall though, as the summer of 2008 winds down, it was great to see a film where laughs and a huge budget went together so smoothly. Well done.",1225411200,,5378,4.726012793176972
