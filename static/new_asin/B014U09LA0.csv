7424715,4,B014U09LA0,"This is an Indonesian film I viewed with English subtitles. It opens with a lengthy narration by an elderly woman Guru Cempeka of the respected House of the Golden Cane. She has four students she instructs. She informs us that the real purpose of a warrior is to defend the weak and powerless. It is not for arena fighting. The Guru has to teach a student the ultimate move using the Golden Cane. She chooses Dara, the youngest of the two females and goes away with her and Angin, the youngest of the two males to teach her the ""undefeatable move."" The two older students believe they are entitled and are unhappy with the choice. This sets in motion a house divided, and a lot of bamboo stick fighting.

This has the great Asian cinematography that we come to expect in epic films. The fighting at times is noticeably choreographed with small spurts of anti-gravity moves. They did have an interesting move in the beginning where they kick stones and gravel into the air and use the bamboo stick like a baseball bat and make projectiles out of the stones.  They never used it again.

7424716,4,B014U09LA0,"The movie surprised me a lot. Was a bit hesitant when i first heard about this. I was afraid it's gonna be a cheap-looking martial art film from Indonesia. It turned out the opposite. The production is great. Love the cinematography. The acting is more than decent especially Eva Celia. The fighting choreography is top notch too. Plot wise is not too bad, nothing original but it holds well. I wish the fighting at the end lasted longer and bigger. Overall i'm so happy with this film.",1446508800,5,486,4.597701149425287
7424717,4,B014U09LA0,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

It seems the action film market is seeing an increase in movies from Indonesia.  I imagine this is due, in part, to the success of films like THE RAID.  But regardless of the reason, we (as viewers) can be thankful, for many of these films are well made and a lot of fun.  THE GOLDEN CANE WARRIOR is one of these very films.  And while the plot might not sound all too original, this movie is definitely a must-see for fans of martial arts cinema.

This film offers many reasons to like it.  The cinematography looks great, the acting is decent, the scenery is beautiful, and the fight choreography is amazing.  In short, this movie contains every positive aspect I look for.

As mentioned above, THE GOLDEN CANE WARRIOR is shot very well.  I like the artistic feel the movie has; it reminds me a lot of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON in that regard.

The acting is pretty good, although I confess Ive never heard of any of these actors.  Eva Celia Latjuba does a great job as the main character, Dara.  Likewise, Reza Rahadian portrays her nemesis, Biru, with ease.  The rest of the cast supports them well, particularly in the action areas.

And speaking of action, THE GOLDEN CANE WARRIOR has plenty of it.  Theres a lot of cane-fighting (which makes sense, seeing as how the title promotes a Golden Cane Warrior, after all), and it is superb.  Each sequence is drenched with intensity and flair, making each skirmish a heart-racing affair.  My sole complaint about the action (and the whole film, for that matter) is how the ultimate move at the end is a bit anticlimactic.  The film gears you up for something amazing, but thenit kinda fizzles.

But that is the only negative thing I can say about the film.  THE GOLDEN CANE WARRIOR is a great, solid addition to the action film genre, and I recommend giving it a look.  The film hits store shelves today, but check it out on Blu-ray if you can.  The HD picture and sound are certainly worth it.",1446508800,4,2023,4.512396694214876
