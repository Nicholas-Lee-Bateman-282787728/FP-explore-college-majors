7858325,5,6303962246,Saw this on HBO many years ago and love that I now own my own copy.  I wish I could see the many stage plays but know they are not available.  Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job and I particularly LOVE Kim Cattrall in her role - she really was FABULOUS!  I also loved Tom Hulce (mostly remembers for Animal House) - he does a wonderful job!,1431043200,,339,3.9558823529411766
7858326,1,6303962246,"Seriously?  This movie is so sad--a great big zero where the main character is supposed to be.  There's no there there.  If a man had written this everybody would be up in arms about this weak, frightened, unable to act in her own interests female character.",1426809600,,258,4.565217391304348
7858327,5,6303962246,"This has to be my all-time favorite movie.  When I first saw it, it just stopped me in my tracks. It speaks to women of a certain age in a visceral way.  I own it on video and have waited for years to find it on DVD.",1389398400,,216,3.574468085106383
7858328,2,6303962246,"The movie was just as dull and frustrating as the film. Relationships are alleged but not developed. Everything is treated as though you already know what is going on. I liked this story the first time I saw it, but now wonder how it got a Pulitzer --",1273190400,,251,4.25
7858329,5,6303962246,"Heidi Holland, with her degrees from Vassar and Yale and a  Fulbright in England under her belt, opens this film lecturing on art history, showing fine portraits of women, painted by women artists who are virtually unknown, though their work is as good as that of the male painters who dominated their ages.  Using the art history ""hook"" into the question of women and their roles--as they see their roles, as men see women's roles, and as women search for happiness within these roles--director Paul Bogart gives life to Wendy Wasserstein's teleplay, adapted from her Pulitzer Prize-winning stage play of the same name.  Introducing each change of time period through the changing slides of the art history lecture, the film explores women trying to find meaning in their lives from the late 1960s through the 1990s.

Jamie Lee Curtis as Heidi Holland, Tom Hulce as her best friend Peter Patrone, and Peter Friedman as Scoop Rosenbaum, her sometime lover, take us from Heidi's high school and college days, as she grows in her thinking and view of her role in life, to her experiences with women's lib focus groups, the Eugene McCarthy campaign, the death of John Lennon, the campaign of Geraldine Ferraro, the rise of AIDS, the gay movement, and ultimately Heidi's realization of what is important to her,  not just professionally and philosophically, but personally and emotionally.

High humor and absurdity are nicely balanced with sentiment and sorrowful revelation.  Though the film treats significant social movements in a relatively brief time, it offers much food for thought without hitting the viewer over the head with polemics.  Fine acting, much of it low key, note-perfect period details (the hairstyles for both men and women are priceless), and excellent pacing create a film that is simultaneously charming and enlightening.  ""Meatier"" than most films created for the neighborhood theater, this teleplay represents one of the finest moments in television production, bringing to the home screen a production which both engages the mind and amuses the spirit.

7858330,5,6303962246,This movie has real and believable characters in Heidi (Curtis) and Peter (Hulce).  It chronicles aspects of her life in such a way to really give the viewer a flavor of those 30 years and one woman's experiences that so  many movies lack.  It is a definate must have.,941587200,,268,4.428571428571429
7858331,5,6303962246,"Jamie Lee Curtis proves her ability to truly carry a major work in ""The Heidi Chronicles."" Spanning three decades in the life of Curtis' Heidi, this film deals with the kind of real situations that people  face with none of the unreal extraordinary circumstances that other films  feel a need to drag in. Occasionally overly sappy or maudlin (can't we have  at least ONE movie with a gay character who DOESN'T deal with a ""close  friend"" dying of AIDS?
Hulce is terrific in the supporting role, and  Nicki Vannice (of television's ""Getting By"" contributes a  scene-stealing cameo as a teenager at a female support group. An overall  winner of a film.",929232000,,650,4.801801801801802
