7845769,2,6303421717,"Dale Apollo Cook may be considered among the best kickboxers of America, but hes also among the worst action heroes of the 90s to have a substantial solo career. For whatever complex reasons contributing to the overall quality of a stars output, Cook repeatedly starred in disappointing kick flicks, most of them shot in the Philippines. Among the most disappointing of these is Fist of Glory  a kickboxing picture masquerading as a war film, and Cooks first movie ever. In short, it stinks.

The story: A soldier serving in Vietnam (Cook,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Kickboxer-2/dp/B00009MEBV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Kickboxer 2</a>) enters a deadly underground fighting circuit to free his drug-addled comrade (Maurice Smith,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist-II/dp/6305824703/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist II</a>).

Along with the VHS cover, the films opening 28 minutes would have you believe that this is a typical war movie, as its comprised of Cook leading a team of soldiers through a jungle before engaging in a massive firefight. Afterwards, the story abruptly changes to Cook looking for Maurice Smith, who plays the heroin-addicted champ of the aforementioned fight circuit. I could accept the sudden genre change if the filmmakers made it worth my while, but it turns out that the latter portion of the film is just as bad as the former. Fist of Glory is boring, beginning with characters that are difficult to invest in and a consistently tiresome tone. Like so many movies shot in the Philippines, its produced without flair and is tedious in its colorlessness. Its hard to care about anything going on here, including the action scenes.

The one thing the action content has going for it is amplitude: boasting 14 full-length fight scenes and at least two major firefights, youll never have to wait long to see someone get punched or gunned down. There are a couple moments of inspiration, including the vengeful final shootout and the films best match, which plagiarizes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>&nbsp;in the form of a burly crowd favorite (Cris Aguilar,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>) who temporarily blinds Dale. However, as a majority, the shootouts last way longer than anyone can be interested in. The brawls feature no fighters worth caring about, as well as choreography so bland and lackluster that it makes the matches of Jean-Claude Van Damme seem as creative as Jackie Chans.

Fist of Glory floats on a slow tide of mediocrity - never sinking so low as to achieve a rock-bottom rating but never rising beyond its very meager standards. In the future, Cook would show some improvement (primarily through the efforts of more talented costars), but his freshman vehicle is worth ignoring. Leave it be, folks.",1450742400,,3085,6.099078341013825
7845770,3,6303421717,"Judging by the cover of the box, one would expect that Fist of Glory is about warfare, but a large portion of the movie also involves ring fighting.  This is another B-action film starring Dale ""Apollo"" Cook, and whenever he's in a film, the overall quality diminishes compared to the typical B-action film.  Fist of Glory isn't as bad as say ""Blood Ring"" or ""Fist of Steel"".  While there is an overload of action in Fist of Glory, its basically the same stuff over and over and grows tiresome rather easily.

The movie begins in Vietnam, during the final days of the war.  Jake Reynolds (Cook) and James Lee (Maurice Smith) lead a unit on an unauthorized mission.  Whatever that mission is, we never find out.  The first 30 minutes of the film is nothing but guns and explosions, and serioulsy without much of a point.  It felt like watching a video game.  There is almost no dialouge, and while there is plenty of action, it was both entertaining yet was given way too much screentime.  Eight months later, we see that Lee has been taken by some locals to fight in illegal ring matches (technically set on a platform like in Bloodsport), and Reynolds gets out of the hospital from war injuries to learn that Lee is missing.  Reynolds meets a man who trains him and gets him into the fights, but the fight owner forces Reynolds to work his way up to Lee.  Reynolds eventually fights Lee, and uses the fight to rescue him.  Naturally, the owner and his gang go after the two and it is back to another war-like scene, with lots of guns and explosions finishing off the film.

The most positive thing about Fist of Glory is there is a lot of action.  Unfortunately, I'd have to say that it is redundant action, and the fights are uninteresting and poorly choreographed.  The acting is poor, of course, and there is plenty of cheese throughout the film (but not good cheese, like No Retreat No Surrender type films).  In the end, I was rather pleased it was finally over.  This was a long hour and half that could easily fit into 45 minutes, but the unexciting action just kept dragging.  It's entertaining, to a point.  If you like constant gun fire, explosions, grenades and the works - hey you might like this.  If you are looking for lots of ring fights, there's that too, but if you are looking for good ring fights - keep looking.",1194134400,,2333,4.494061757719715
