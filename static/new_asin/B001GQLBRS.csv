8306690,3,B001GQLBRS,"The content of the video is well presented, well explained and builds logically.

The DVD I received, however, plays like a copy of a copy of copy of a VHS.  Fuzzy, blurred, even the titles are not crisp.  I suggest they digitally reproduce this from the masters and try again.",1403827200,,277,4.5
8306691,5,B001GQLBRS,"This video and the book of the same title are very comprehensive on a variety of throws and places great emphasis on how set up the throws and body alignment.
The throws are more of the sort that one would expect from Tai Chi and does not include throws from aikido and judo.
There are 14 throws in all that are explained in great detail to develop the principals of the throws such that the reader can develop variations on the throws.

The video is very good, and goes very well with this book. The video is in color and is very clear, where as the pictures in the book are too dark. In comparing the video to the book, it looks like the pictures in the book were taken directly from the video, but that the printing process made the printed pictures darker.
If you buy one, you should buy the other.",1286496000,,802,4.241830065359477
