2201807,5,B00076YPPI,"Man, I really liked this DVD. It was my springboard into Bossa Nova guitar. The DVD gives you plenty of material for practicing Bossa Nova technique. Some are what the author called ""rhythmic,"" while others are ""harmonic,"" and the remaining ones have a bit of a melody included in them. Also there is an accurate little tab book included to help you get the chords right.

I started using the DVD after I had been playing guitar for around two years or so. It not only taught me Bossa Nova, but also helped me with my chord work and progressions. Up to that point, I had been studying primarily single-note songs, mainly Rock, Blues, and Jazz lead work.

He starts out with several progressions, and then teaches you different rhythm patterns to play them to. Most of the songs are slow to moderately fast, but some are very busy and fast. Also, the instructor, who was very clear and communicated well by the way, gives you some patterns that approximate the style of several Bossa Nova guitar greats. It shows just how complex and difficult this stuff can get, if you want to push it!

For those wanting to concetrate only on Bossa Nova Guitar, this DVD could really occupy your time. The bonus performances were also great, and one could transcribe the songs by starting and stopping the DVD and writing down the notes. The camera shots are very clear, and during demonstrations, shows both hands. The left hand is shown on the main screen with the right hand being an inset image in the upper left corner.

The only thing missing for me was more instruction on the arpeggios and single note lead runs that he laced into the Bossa Nova rhythms during his performances. But many would argue that  that is a course in an of itself!

If you are new to Bossa Nova, this DVD will really get you going, and give you a solid foundation. I don't think you will be disappointed!",1269993600,15,1872,4.540059347181009
2201808,5,B00076YPPI,"This is a wonderful dvd. The playing and songs are beautiful.

I'd just like to clear up that there are NO LICKS covered on the DVD- even though it says ""lick samples."" This is strictly chords and progressions.",1203552000,11,210,4.526315789473684
2201809,5,B00076YPPI,"For several years I've been trying to learn Brazilian guitar on my own, with very mixed results.  I've struggled with other books and videos, which I've found overly-complicated or, in the case of chords and chord progressions, frankly misleading.  Well, this DVD is different.  In slow, deliberate fashion, Brazilian jazz master Romero Lubambo demonstrates a series of ascending and descending chord sequences that, I guarantee, will have newbies slapping their heads and muttering ""so that's how it's done.""  He doesn't solo or demonstrate entire songs, except for a couple of performances with members of his renowned Trio da Paz, and with his vocalist wife Pamela Driggs.  So advanced guitarists looking to learn the bossa nova repertoire won't get as much out of this DVD as those simply trying to understand the basics of the genre.  And that leads me to my one quibble with the DVD.  The accompanying booklet includes helpful transcriptions of the lessons by members of the Japanese team that produced the DVD.  But why couldn't they include a CHORD CHART!?!  Bossa nova chords are voiced very differently from American jazz chords and it would have been extremely helpful to learn the chords first, before watching the DVD.  Oh well, this is still a terrific DVD for guitarists who want to penetrate the mysteries of this beautiful music.  Thank you, Mr. Lubambo!",1202601600,22,1371,5.075892857142857
2201810,5,B00076YPPI,"Can't say enough good things about this instructional DVD. Mr Lubambo is very likeable  as instructor,  and the lessons progress at a challenging, but not impossible rate from basic to fairly advanced. If you are a guitarist who has gotten in a bit of a rut with the ordinary type chords and progressions this is a great way to expand your horizons . Learning the context for many of the chords is another  benefit. A great way to get the basics of a beautiful and melodic musical style.",1183507200,10,487,4.511363636363637

8045187,4,B00076YPPI,"Excellent lessons by R. Lubambo.  Not sure if it was just my copy but the DVD does have Japanese subtitles, which I found extremely distracting.  I checked and did not see anything to that effect on the product description.  Would I have known, I would not have purchased.",1448841600,,272,4.625

8045189,2,B00076YPPI,"I purchased this dvd to learn the basics of Bosa Nova guitar. While there is a small booklet that accompanies the DVD, it has no text or descriptions. Worse, It has no chord chart either. Not all that helpful, really.

Also,the teaching style of the video was hard to follow and the audio not very clear.

I do not recommend this video as an intro to playing Bosa Nova guitar.",1428192000,,376,4.357142857142857

8045191,5,B00076YPPI,I had tried other Bossa Nova guitar lessons but they don't compare with this. The others just showed a chord and then another chord but Romero shows how they flow together to make a song. Very nicely done and easy to follow instruction. Comes with the music and I put it on a Xerox and enlarged it a bit. Now it's perfect. I highly recommend this!,1413849600,,347,4.2727272727272725

8045194,5,B00076YPPI,"This is a very useful introduction to learning to play bossa nova rhythms on the nylon stringed Brasilian guitar by a true master of the genre. But it is more than an introduction, especially for those guitarists who are not novices to this style.  The DVD is infused with Mr. Lubambo's love for the the Brasilian guitar and several famous players are alluded to with some notable examples of their styles of play. In his discussion of seminal guitarists Joao Gilberto, Luiz Bonfa, Baden Powell, Helio Delmiro, Garoto, and Toninho Horta the  implication for the listener is to delve further by listening to them as well. As for the material covered: The excercises are readily accomplished and progress rhythmically, and technically through the DVD. They are not harmonically challenging. As he aptly indicates, the Brasilian guitar style is best played by plucking with the right hand thumb (for the bass or ""surdo"" rhythm) and the 3 fingers for chording of the middle strings. This is well illustrated with the split screen showing the right hand plucking style along with left hand fingerings (an added benefit is the addition of fret marker dots on the fingerboard to help the viewer). The companion booklet shows both the musical score and standard chord symbols, and the tablature (tab) as well for those who don't read music. Chord diagrams are not shown per se but these can be derived directly from looking at the tab. What I enjoy especially on this DVD is hearing and seeing Mr. Lubambo playing together with others in a comfortable setting where he can just relax and cut loose. As he does so he incorporates both rhythmic and melodic passages seemlessly that exude his joy and passion for the music. As an educator his enthusiasm for the music is superb. For those who are motivated to learn more about Brasilian guitar I would also highly recommend the Brasilian Guitar Book by Nelson Faria which is essential though at a more intermediate level.",1389398400,4,1960,4.882882882882883
8045195,5,B00076YPPI,"Robert Sayers' review of this DVD and instruction booklet is spot on - this is the single best and definitive introduction to authentic Brasilian bossa nova guitar styles available to English-speakers. I think the instruction is probably best suited for those who, at whatever level of proficiency with the guitar (from relative beginner to expert players), are looking for a solid and sound introduction to bossa nova; differing slightly with Mr. Sayers on this point, I think even very experienced players can benefit from Romero Lubambo's demonstrations and specific knowledge of bossa nova and other Brasilian guitar styles. I lived in Rio for four years, and grew up with this music, although (to my regret) I didn't really take up the guitar until much later. There are an awful lot of instruction materials that purport to teach bossa nova or other Brasilian guitar styles, but most of them are made by people whose musical background and foundations are in other music traditions entirely; they may be excellent musicians and very talented guitarists, but in my experience too many of them don't really ""get"" bossa nova and samba. Romero Lubambo's qualifications really stand out here - because he is a true Brasilian and a world-class guitarist who is also fluent in English, he is uniquely qualified to provide this kind of instruction to people who really want to play this music on guitar and get it exactly right. There is an awful lot to be learned from this single DVD and booklet. Nelson Faria's ""The Brazilian Guitar Book"" is another excellent resource for genuine Brasilian guitar music, but in my opinion Romero Lubambo's DVD and booklet are the better place to start for most guitarists. Anybody who masters the material on this one DVD will have learned all they need to play the world's most beautiful popular music in just the way it was meant to be played.",1376524800,7,1880,4.933753943217666
