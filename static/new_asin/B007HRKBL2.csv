8516848,5,B007HRKBL2,Again I used to watch the Carry On movies on TCM on saturday's but all of a sudden they went off and I figured the movies got a little too sexy in the late 60's with a lot of women taking off their clothes and the skits mostly turned to sex more than comedy. But that's ok with me that's why I like them. Barbara Windsor is a howl and I love the Carry On gang and I love British humor..that's how Benny Hill became so popular. He was just copying the Carry On Format. If you like this kind of humor I would say try Carry On.,1470355200,,524,3.861111111111111

8516851,4,B007HRKBL2,"The Carry On series was very popular in Britain, for 20 years, I think.  I think Carry On Again Doctor was filmed first, since they make reference to it in the camping one.  The Carry On Again Doctor film was very slapstick and did not appeal to me.
Carry On Camping, however, was rather entertaining, though.  A lot of the humor was slapstick, but in a very humorous way.  The actors played their parts well, and the plot was a lot more entertaining than I had expected.
I hope to purchase more of the Carry On series, as a result.",1397174400,,532,4.29
