8540555,4,7010074860,"I was recently in Shanghai, for perhaps the 4th time, and this old silent B/W DVD reminded me of much that is still visible in China today.  This film could have been made 1000 years ago: no cars, electricity, tractors, modcons, etc.  Basic emotions, extremely well portrayed.  Simple story of poor country girl in love with rich city boy: romeo and juliet in old china.  I see why she was a star, such an expressive face, such awful bad people. How many people watching this DVD will realize that in real life she committed suicide at age 24?  It sounds trite but this old tear-jerker is far more authentic than most of the junk that Hollywood is turning out today.  For those who like Chinese furniture, architecture, and customs, this is a field-day of pictorial life in 1920's China.  There are sufficient English title cards so that we can follow the story. There are still many places in rural China which look just like the scenes in this timeless film.  A few years ago in rural China I saw a woman pulling a plow through a field as a man steered the plow: perhaps they switched places at the end of the row, but can you imagine such a thing in our modern ""western"" world?",1323648000,,1180,4.455813953488372
