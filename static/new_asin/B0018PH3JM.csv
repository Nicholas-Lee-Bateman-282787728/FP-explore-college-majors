It's compelling and hard to keep from watching the entire season in one sitting!",1252368000,2,254,5.023809523809524
3418146,5,B0018PH3JM,I am addicted.  Orangutans are so fascinating and they are just so cute!  A show that would be appropriate for all ages.  I highly recommend this series to everyone.  Support this show and the preservation of orangutans!!!!,1250380800,16,223,4.945945945945946
3418147,5,B0018PH3JM,"Absolutely wonderful programming.
Our family love this show.
I've seen a group of wild kids run through my livingroom & come to a screeching halt to sit quietly & watch the ""monkeys"".
Truly amazing - informative - you can't help but to fall in love with all the different characters ( orangutans) on the show.
Highly reccomend this video !",1231286400,7,339,4.666666666666667
3418148,5,B0018PH3JM,"I love monkeys and apes, I'll be the first to admit. But bias aside, this is, I think, one of the BEST shows that was on TV. And the whole family can enjoy it!

Orangutans, one of our closest living relatives, are critically endangered. Deforestation and poaching are bringing their numbers dangerously close to a point of no return. When a parent dies, usually the young orangutan would follow shortly after. However, the classmates of Nyaru Mentang have been rescued and are raised by humans in hopes of releasing them into the wild. This is a long process, as the dependency period of a baby orang on it's mother is the longest in the mammalian family, aside from humans.

The show is always good for a laugh, and I find it always makes me smile, no matter my mood going into it. Most of it is pretty happy, though there are sad parts of the episodes, and some of the stories about the orangutans are heartbreaking. Take Bonita for instance - poachers shot her mother out of a tree, and she clung to her mother's hair on the way down. After mother and child hit the ground, the poachers came and literally ripped her away from her dead mother, most likely to be sold into a life of solitary confinement in a cramped cage.

Within a couple episodes you'll get to know the orangutans, and learn to appreciate and understand their complex social structure, and their quirks. Each is very distinctive and has a readily discernible personality.

Watching them, one can't help but feel like you are looking at people. They think, they plan, they ponder, they trick, they scheme, they cry, they laugh, they love (two romances start up during season 1!!). These intelligent and gentle creatures will easily capture your heart, and you'll find that each episode ends much too quickly.",1222128000,28,1778,4.670926517571885
3418149,5,B0018PH3JM,"This series is one of the best nature shows that has ever been created. Follow the orangs as they try to learn and survive in an enviroment that their species calls home.

Orangutan Island is an extremely entertaining and informative nature series that delivers the entertainment and keeps the viewer sticking to the tv screen. Also, watch out for Season 2 of Orangutan Island this fall on Animal Planet!

Buy this great two disc set that contains thirteen episodes of the complete first season. Its cheap and its worth the entertainment. Especially if you love animals or apes! Buy and enjoy!",1221091200,21,593,4.861386138613861

3418168,5,B0018PH3JM,"If you love oranguta ns as much as I do, this two disc set is a 'must have' !  You follow a bunch of orphaned orangutans learning to live on their own in the wild.  These incredibly intelligent animals are full of surprises, and their journey is quite entertaining to watch.  You won't be sorry if you buy this, and it is a series you will watch many times without ever being bored!",1424822400,,382,4.205479452054795

3418170,5,B0018PH3JM,"I never realized that wild Orangutans were solitary animals for most of their lives. It's so sad to see their homes being destroyed and being killed by poachers or sold into slavery as someone's pet, but it's so great to see them grow up from babies and getting taught how to survive back in the wild. They are such gentle souls. It's touching how sweet they are with the human caretakers to actually listen to them with no question because the Orangutans know they are there to help them. I also never realized the sounds they make and how sensitive they are to being bullied or lack of attention when they want/need it. It's wonderful to see them learn from each other and help each other out in times of need. I won't go into a certain episode where one of them dies because the tears are already falling from the heartbreak in that episode. It's a wonderful show to watch and witness such sweet, special, precious animals!!",1422057600,,927,4.523809523809524
3418171,5,B0018PH3JM,"Love this series.  It is very entertaining and educational.  I got addicted to it, but the series is so limited in number.  I wonder what has happened to the orangutans. Wish they would make a follow-up show.  I wish they would have made more episodes.",1420416000,,252,4.533333333333333
3418172,5,B0018PH3JM,"Incredible.  This show could have gone on forever and I would never tire of it.  Filmed well, edited well, and the orangutans are smartest stars on reality TV.  Really couldn't get enough of this show.",1412899200,,201,4.685714285714286

3418177,5,B0018PH3JM,"From the TV series, this DVD will have you smiling and sometimes teary-eyed.  But always well informed about these extremely endangered Great Apes, so near to humans in intelligence and all our human feelings and yearnings.  One of the most amazing things is how unique and individual each featured orangutan is - again, like humans.

Another thing that strikes me about orangutans and other Great Apes, is their tremendous love for their children.  You never see a mother abuse her baby - just gently removing a little hand reaching for the wrong plant, or needing help navigating branches. Humans could learn a lot from them.

I already owned this DVD, but bought a second as a gift.  I know the recipient will enjoy and treasure it as much as I do.",1402272000,,751,4.694656488549619

This video shows what is happening to the orangutan and how an ever increasing number of orphans have survived in Borneo. I've always loved watching the orangutans because, despite their short thumbs, their hands so resemble ours, and they like to use tools. Watching the orangutans, and how they form a society is a real treat, especially with the narration.",1388275200,,434,4.958904109589041

3418195,5,B0018PH3JM,"I had began to become bored with mundane, self centered and unrealistic tv programs when I sprung across an episode of orangutan island on the animal planet network. It brought me back to my missionary days in Indonesia when I was asked by Floyd ""Juice"" Nipsky to join the O-Team to help protect and rescue these beautiful and intelligent mammals. Once you get to know orangutans, there is no way you'll ever forget them. They stay in your heart and mind forever. Floyd and the O-Team Foundation built rescue centers in more than a dozen different locations in Indonesia. It was asked of me to help nurture the young baby ""boom booms"" (my cute lil nickname for baby orangutans). I believe that it took these young snuggle snacks quite some time to get used to me and more importantly trust my god given hands from which i offered food. I wasn't your average missionary. You see, Floyd had saved me from the streets of Oakland back in '86 where I had met him at saltys tavern on east 88th street. I was a pool hsutler at saltys 7 days a week and also a full blown alcoholic spening many a nights behind bars and in shelter homes. Floyd had seen promise in my eyes and immediately asked me to help him in his missionaries abroad. When I first met ""ruprict"", a 5 yr old greasebacked looking female orangutan, well let's just say that was it for me. I became addicted to her and always made a bed for her at night, usually with a pile of thick jungle banana leafs. I spent the next 15 years doing work for Floyd and the O-Team until I eventually bought saltys tavern. Now im back where it all started on good old east 88th in oakland.",1325980800,,1630,4.382838283828383

3418207,5,B0018PH3JM,"This series is absolutely wonderful.  It is so good that it
is hard to describe.  It resembles a ""soap opera"" of totally
unpredictable characters.  The reason, of course, is that they
are not humans.

Just get the DVD.  You will come to love the various characters.

I can not believe that they have not released season 2 yet.",1318204800,,326,4.5344827586206895

Watch her and other faves all  learn to live free on the island,and feel sympathy for them when they got sick wit mysterious malaria type illnesses.

I hope so but I still laugh when I watch an episode I have already watched.  Great for the entire family. Orangutans do not fight to the death for dominance.
