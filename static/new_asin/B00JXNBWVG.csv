8654527,3,B00JXNBWVG,"I'm largely happy with it. It's a spin off of Ida Lupino's Four Star Playhouse. I collect those & wish someone like Critrerion would do a box of the entire series.

The good: in most cases, these are the best prints of 4ST I've ever seen, & I only already had one of the episodes.

The not as good: a few episodes had somewhat jerky motion.

The weird: I've never seen this before, but the dvd was authored really strangely. Pushing ""play all"" caused it to do a random shuffle of episodes, including repeating some. I THINK I saw all 10!

The irritating: They used the name ""Peter Lorre"" both in the advertising on the VCI website & on the back of the case; but he is nowhere to be found on the disc.",1454457600,2,700,4.201492537313433
8654528,3,B00JXNBWVG,"A fun look at one of the more popular, but weaker, anthology series of the 50s.
While there are worthwhile performances by almost every ""star"" (actually, most are solid character actors/second leads) too many of the scripts are woefully lacking in polish and seem to be turned out for time purposes rather than quality.
Also, neither Henry Fonda, nor Howard Duff (both referenced on the back copy) appear in this collection.
And, while we're at it, there is no ""S"" at the end of David Niven.",1408406400,7,491,4.72093023255814
