8676201,5,B00N49P97I,"I really like this dvd. The total workout  is about 44 minutes and I really felt my muscle been worked and I was shaking at the end of the workout.  I have a lot of barre dvds and this was challenging for me for the most part,  I am combining this with cardio like insanity and I have seen amazing results. I am not a beginner I have done workout like insanity, Tonique, Cathe, Kelly coffey, Tracy Anderson, suspension training and Kettle bell and my body is a combination of all the above workout. I have a non bulky figure with muscle definition which I love. I did not paid $60.00 for it, You can buy it for $24.99 if you order this form  Purebarre website.",1433203200,4,660,4.214285714285714
