8356218,5,B0028H1GAG,"This is a beautiful dvd.  There are three reasons to purchase it:  1)  If you have ever had any interest in how an icon (those lovely,orthodox paintings) are created, this dvd walks you through it, step by step.  And it is truly fascinating.  It is very counter intuitive and unlike most western art.  2) It is a beautifully crafted DVD that also displays the techniques of a particular school of iconography, the Prosopon school.  It is wonderful to see the ancient techniques and skills being transmitted. 3) Watching this DVD is like going into the deepest levels of prayer.  There is such love of the subject matter, that it shines through.

I recommend this without reservation.  I wish it could be obtained new!",1329868800,4,717,4.7560975609756095
