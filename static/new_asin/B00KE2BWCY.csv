8658017,4,B00KE2BWCY,"This is 2010 KILL KATIE MALONE recycled.

 Three college kids purchase an Irish ghost on-line. The spirit grants them wishes, but also protects them at the cost of others. The ghost, for some reason, likes to redecorate, and is not very good at it. The film is low budget. The gore sequences take place off camera to avoid the idiotic special effects that kill low budget productions. Instead they spent their money on a good script, some fair acting and direction. Better than an Asylum production. Makes for a fair rental.

The movie has the same scare potential as the paranormal series, without the annoyance. The movie sets up for a sequel with some real potential.

Some bad language, no sex, no nudity.",1448150400,,709,4.739837398373984
