8210192,4,B000TME4QU,"NBC-TV aired the 15-minute Jonathan Winters Show during their 1956-57 season. The program followed a formula of ""monologue, guest vocalist, monologue,"" within which Winters was able to demonstrate his unique stand-up comedy skills.

VIDEO YESTERYEAR's VHS tape of this material is recorded at SLP speed. Tracking on my machine is solid and quality of the transfers surprisingly good.  (not available on DVD)

SHOW #!: ""Fishing"" (4/16/57)
Winters intros the topic and free associates for a few minutes. A rather talentless and breathy on the high notes Jeri Southern flatly struggles with the ballad ""Do I Love You."" In the main section, Winters portrays a bass and his buddies and the lake fishermen trying to catch them. Cliff Norton pantomimes in two TUMS commercials during the proceedings.

SHOW #2:  ""General Custer""  (2/26/57)
Winters introduces fictional celebrities sitting in the studio audience. Betty Johnson smiles her way through an upbeat novelty tune. The main monologue, ""General Custer at Little Big Horn,"" has multiple characters and the typical Winters vocal sound effects. Program closes with a VICKS Cough Drop commercial.
