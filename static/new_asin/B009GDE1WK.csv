I was searching for a jpop group similar to snsd and this is as close to them as I've found so far although i don't think any group will ever surpass snsd. Perfume is good too but to me their songs aren't nearly as catchy as those by snsd.  Picture is clear, the audio is good and i like the guitar solos in some of the songs. If your looking for uplifting performances and music you should get this set.",1504137600,,488,4.191489361702128

8541188,5,B009GDE1WK,"Fantastic Shows, All 3 days of this event had enough of a difference to make them all enjoyable. 77 unique songs over 3 shows and 25+ songs that were done on 2 or all 3 of the shows.",1461369600,2,182,3.8157894736842106
8541189,5,B009GDE1WK,"I realize no else may buy this but for those who might be thinking about it, BUY IT!  Like every AKB48 box set you will see things you cannot even imagine.  As Anthony Bourdain (chef and host of ""No Reservations"") has said about one Japanese show (Robot Restaurant, if you don't know you'll need to Google it....), ""I don't understand what I just saw but whatever it was it was the greatest thing I've ever seen.  And I'm from New York!""  This is how I felt after watching over 300 performers sing and dance with a happiness and energy that is over the top!  The set, staging, props, lighting EVERYTHING is like Vegas, Cirque de Soleil and every pop group concert blended together times 1000!!!!  You just have to see it to believe it and even then you won't believe such a concert could exist!  Some particulars: The performers are all girls/women 14 to 24 years old, all Japanese.  There are NO sub-titles.  (It doesn't matter!)  DO notice every performer's costume is different!  Crazy!  It can only come from Japan!",1442361600,2,1019,4.6
