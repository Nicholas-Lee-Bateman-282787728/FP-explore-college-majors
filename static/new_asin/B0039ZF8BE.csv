4099562,4,B0039ZF8BE,I'd never heard of this series before. I was pleasantly pleased.  It held my interest and is non violent.,1287532800,3,105,4.526315789473684
4099563,2,B0039ZF8BE,"This is a low budget mystery non-thriller.  On the positive side, there's no sex or violence.  Indeed, there isn't much action to speak of at all. The plots involve little more than the tedious succession of characters that, at the end, turn out to be someone else. Try reconstructing the plot after you've seen it crash into its inevitably boring climax.

The photography is wretched, with many face shots almost into the nostrils and lots of traffic scenes to pad out the required time.  A little white spot appears in the upper right hand corner of the screen for several minutes at a time.  I don't blame the photographers for that, however.  That would require ingenuity.

The hero is barely more than a faceless bureaucrat, his sidekick might be a zombie (and how about that wig!), and the comic relief focuses on an office worker who doesn't work much!  Music?  Was there any?  The directing is strictly on the amateur side.  In short, save your money or watch Frost, Morse, and Gently over again.",1285545600,10,1004,4.712643678160919
4099564,5,B0039ZF8BE,"If you like watching a spy catch a spy; here's a set to own. It's created in mid 1980s when British spies used floppy disc drives, VHS tape, audiotape, and dial phones. Mr. Palfrey (Alec McCowen-'Travels with My Aunt','Victoria & Albert') is a spy-buster. A hunter of spies within. He's slick & effective--Westminster's ace. The spy activity is believable--not Hollywood super-hero, super-tech, super-action style. Palfrey was a bit stuffy in the 1st season (episodes 1-4) but eventually the dialogue gave him some quick wit adding sprinklings of humor amid the intrigue. Call it 4 1/2 stars, if you must, for age, but it's better than most 21st century spy films.

10 episodes, each about 50 minutes. SUBTITLES have been added for those who like using them. Plenty of British stars join the series as guests.

Series 1-Episode 1  ONCE YOUR CARD IS MARKED
Palfrey's surprise new boss is female, known only as the Coordinator (Caroline Blakiston-""The Forsyte Saga"",""Wives and Daughters"",""Scoop""). Palfrey must find and secure a diplomat, Mr. Springer, believed spying for Soviets. A spy or scapegoat?

1-2 THE HONEYPOT AND THE BEES
Air Vice Marshal Conyers (Richard Johnson-""The Robinsons""), defense official, & a young Czech girl disappear. The Coordinator assumes there's a supreme security risk.

1-3 THE DEFECTOR
Palfrey cautions the Coordinator about announcing a Russian author's, Volkov (Julian Glover-""The Young Victoria"",""Wish Me Luck"") defection. Is it just a trap since the KGB gets involved? Also Yelena (Deborah Grant-""Bergerac"",""Crown Prosecutor""), a Russian acquaintance of Palfrey gets into the scene.

1-4 A PRESENT FROM LEIPZIG
A Russian 13th Century icon is found by the Coordinator even though never reported stolen. Why? And why is an E. German visiting a Brit industrialist?

Series 2-Episode 1  FREEDOM FROM LONGING
Blair (regular, Clive Wood-""London's Burning"",""Press Gang"") is called in to help investigate Martina (Estelle Kohler-""The Main Chance""), a Czech woman with who he once had an affair. Is she a Russian spy? Palfrey questions Blair's involvement. Martina's breasts get exposed for a few seconds, the only reason for the box warning.

2-2 RETURN TO SENDER
Returning after defection to the Soviets, spy Rupert Styles (Leslie Phillips- ""Chancer"",""Ruth Rendell Mysteries"") is assigned to Palfrey for silencing. As always, Palfrey has his own way of doing things. Nikolai Baliev (Clive Francis-""Poldark"",""Sense and Sensibility"",""Lipstick on Your Collar"")is involved. Excellent episode.

2-3 MUSIC OF A DEAD PROPHET
Palfrey is assigned to sabotage a book publication revealing a 1950's Iranian assassination. Of course it's a gov-cover-up. What to do?

2-4 OFFICIAL SECRET
Palfrey is to stop a past government man from telling the media that there are continuing double agents at work in Britain. Yelena is a defector under state protection. McNair (David Quilter-""Grange Hill"",""Lilies"") is responsible for her safety. There is an omelet-size bit of romance.

2-5 SPYGAME
Palfrey's trailing a space engineer, Madison (David Baxt-""We'll Meet Again"")that the CIA believes is spying for the Soviets. A computer connected ""Star Wars"" battle game leads to clues and suspects.

2-6 THE BAITED TRAP
Coordinator is tipped off by a Soviet that there is a double-agent, namely Bob Sanding (Jim Norton-""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"",""Nanny""). Palfrey is assigned to check it out, even though palfrey is wary. Nikolai (2-2) rekindles contact with Coordinator, for what ends?

4099567,5,B0039ZF8BE,"The spy novel wasn't invented in the United Kingdom - American novelist James Fenimore Cooper is usually credited with doing that when he wrote ""The Spy"" in 1821 - but, for my money, no one does it better than the Brits.
That's probably because so many of the great British spy novelists - Ian Fleming and John LeCarre, to name just two - were former intelligence officers themselves. That allows them to bring a certain degree of authenticity to their stories.
The same might be said for spy movies and television programs. For some reason, the British just seem to do it better than anyone else.
""Mr. Palfrey of Westminster"" is a prime example of just how good the UK is when it comes to producing excellent spy programs.
Palfrey is a middle-aged civil servant who is exceptionally good at ferreting out traitors in the British secret services. He's subtle, can be charming, and is always discreet. As far as his bosses are concerned, he does sometimes come off as if he's not exactly sure what he's doing but that's seldom the case for he has a razor-sharp mind and a wealth of both contacts and experience, which he uses to great advantage.
Set at the close of the Cold War, this short series is a wonderful example of great television produced on a relatively thin budget and without a lot of gratuitous violence. There are no whiz-bang special effects, no hair-raising car chases, and no James Bond-like gadgets. There are, however, smartly written scripts, and excellent portrayals. Alec McCowen, as Palfrey, and Caroline Blackiston - complete with Princess Di haircut - as his boss are exceptional in their roles, for example.
I should make clear that this is not a series for everyone. Those viewers expecting to see shootouts and fancy cars tooling through the streets of London will be disappointed. Palfrey, in fact, generally takes a taxi to get where he's going and he doesn't carry a gun. His assistant - Mr. Blair (played admirably by Clive Wood) - does carry a pistol on occasion but he doesn't burst through any doors with guns blazing.
If, however, you are someone who enjoys the opportunity to think about some of the issues that Palfrey must contend with as a regular part of his job - politically motivated ""witch hunts,"" the interference of higher-ups with their own agendas, the problems of intergovernmental cooperation, etc. - then this is a program you will enjoy.
The verdict: An excellent series, finely acted, tightly written and one that I highly recommend.",1459814400,3,2488,4.815420560747664

4099578,3,B0039ZF8BE,"MR. PALFREY OF WESTMINSTER: THE COMPLETE SERIES, (1984).  This television series concerns  a man  who describes himself as just a civil servant, but is secretly a master of counterespionage. Theatrical star Alec McCowen (TRAVELS WITH MY AUNT) plays the titular character, mild-mannered, middle-aged Palfrey, a British spy who hunts down moles in this production recommended for mature audiences. Clive Wood plays Palfreys junior, Blair; Caroline Blakiston, their boss, the Co-ordinator. The collected spy drama includes all 10 episodes of the series which was seen on PBS in the late 1980s and the 2000s, and has never before been available on DVD.  It runs approx. 501 min. on 3 DVDs, and has, thank you Acorn, SDH subtitles, as sound  and pictureof this older production are not what we have happily gotten accustomed to these days.

To quote Acorn, the episodes are:

Disc 1 (Series 1)
Episode 1: Once Your Card Is Marked

Episode 4: A Present from Leipzig
A stolen Russian icon leads Palfrey to the door of a wealthy industrialist who makes periodic trips to the Eastern Bloc. Why did the man not report the theft? And why is a young East German visiting his home?

Disc 2 (Series 2)
Episode 1: Freedom from Longing
Palfreys assistant, Blair, gets recruited by another department to investigate a suspected Soviet agenta Czech-born woman with whom Blair once had an affair. But Palfrey believes the department may have hidden motives for requesting Blairs aid.

A disgruntled former government official believes that double agents still work in the intelligence serviceand threatens to tip off the press unless something is done. The Coordinator assigns Palfrey to head him off.

Disc 3 (Series 2)
Episode 5: Spy Game
On advice from the CIA, Palfrey surveils an American aerospace engineer suspected of passing the Soviets classified information about an Anglo-American defense project. It looks like the case may unearth a mole, but can Palfrey trust the CIA?

Episode 6: The Baited Trap
A contact at the Soviet embassy informs the Coordinator that one of her agents is playing a double game. Since she doesnt hold this agent in high regard, the Coordinator tells Palfrey to look into itbut he suspects a set-up.

We certainly have here spy stories, though I wouldnt call them thrillers; the pace is slow, and what action there is takes place off stage.  Some viewers might consider the collection dull.  It seems to show an older England, less under American influence than it is now.  Everyone is formally polite and well-dressed; the actors show themselves with moles, warts, brown teeth and all. This is a Thames Television entertainment: in the years I lived in the United Kingdom, I became fond of their productions, as they were well-crafted, and made with a lavish hand. However, Thames must have been having budget troubles by the 1980s, as the series boasts few well-known supporting players, even when the scripts seem to call  for them, and the sets look like they are made of cardboard.  So, not everybodys cuppa.",1383609600,2,4205,5.054992764109985
4099579,4,B0039ZF8BE,"This is a great series, full of sneaky goings on in British governemnt, clever good guys, and one extraordinarly brilliant central character.  I'm very thankful for having found it.",1375142400,,181,5.241379310344827
4099580,5,B0039ZF8BE,The first impression after watching this series is why didn't they make more of them.  McCowen is low key but no pushover for his know it all lady boss.  I have to hand it to the gal that plays his boss she really make you want to put tape over her mouth and let Palfrey get on with the problem. Even though  you know his assistant's ( Clive Wood) ruthless back ground he becomes very endearing. Why oh why didn't they make more of this wonderful series.  My husband I have 80 year old hearing and they have SDH subtitles.,1373760000,,522,4.19
4099581,5,B0039ZF8BE,Excellent Brit Cold War spy series. If you liked Tinker Tailor and Smiley's People you will enjoy this series. Production standards are not flashy.,1365638400,,147,5.166666666666667
4099582,5,B0039ZF8BE,"Excellent. If you like spy stories; don't miss this. Complex stories with unexpected endings. Intelligent plot and interesting characters. No action, just a very good plot.",1322611200,4,172,5.653846153846154
4099583,5,B0039ZF8BE,"This was an excellent series with a total of ten shows, released in 1984 and aired by PBS in the U.S. in the late 80s. They only ran the shows one time. Too bad! It was the last series written by George Markstein of Danger Man/Secret Agent fame. The situation is of a very small department under the indirect control of an unnamed English female prime minister (hmmmm, who could that be?). This department tackles Mission Impossible-style tasks that cannot be carried out by official means, but they do it with a staff of three (Mr. Palfrey, his secretary and his side-kick, Blair) and no high-tech gizmos or budget. How do they do it? Their ""dirty tricks"" are way more tricky than dirty. Both their subjects and their audience are taken on a ride, often with a surprise ending. My favorite episode was ""Return to Sender"" about a Russian double-agent who has decided he wants to return home. Mr. Palfrey assignment is to stop by any means necessary. Just when you think you're going to witness the agent's demise, the team's mastery of psychology saves the day.",1316908800,6,1061,4.679144385026738
4099584,4,B0039ZF8BE,"The acting in this show is spot on when it comes to the way things really are often in spying.  Sure they are adventurous spy games but for many of them it's not so glamorous at all.  Mr. P has a digny office and a boss that reminds me of maggie thatcher. The cases are realistic and unlike a field operative in a foriegn land there is little action to be had. The show moves slowly just like reality often. The plots are reallife too. Thames was a company that made shows for itv which was the bbc's main competition for many decades. Thames and all brit tv was shot on video tape and that's the case here. This continued until the late 80's when it all went to film finally.
The show is very slow and each story plods on as it would in real life at least in 1984-86. They technology is of that time and so are the cold war worries. It's interesting to remember that the terrible cold war would be over in 7 years only!  Noone in 1986 could see this happening! These type of spy stories are very much real ones that had played out over and over through the decades and for people to complain about how slow they were shows that they have no REAL KNOWLEDGE of spycraft. Sure they were some gunfights and big operations but mostly men ran little ops trying to ensare the other side. A good case of this is the story of the defecting author. IS he for real?
and obviously even if he isn't it's not a huge victory for the soviets to plant a man who will later return and say the west sucks. But that is how things really were back then! Each little op was such a thing. Of course at the time of this show it was only just revealed about the evil american turncoat who was working for the soviets for money. The people who died because of him were all soviets too. In such a world of spying even little victories of any kind were tried. THis show has a bureacrat for it's lead! that's not usually done. But fans of action films or high drama who can't take slow plodding spy work , which is most of it usually , may want to avoid this one.",1310169600,9,2035,4.120906801007557
8392618,5,B0039ZF8BE,"We have enjoyed this immensely!  There are subtitles, but the diction of these excellent actors is superb--ergo, easily understood..  That combined with the absence of the horrible boom-boom background music so typical of today's ""dramas"" added to our viewing pleasure.  It is my personal opinion that the overdone soundtracks (aforementioned boom-boom) are for the dual purposes of engaging viewers' short attention spans and writers' lack of interesting content and literary skill.  This series is at once cerebral, exciting, thought-provoking and witty.  Yes, the hair styles and clothes are dated.  There are no cell phones, and few computers.  That said, thoughtful viewers will soon appreciate that the plots are all too relevant today.  A frightening aspect, but there we are.
