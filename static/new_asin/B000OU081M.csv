2799495,4,B000OU081M,"`Maxed Out' is an informative although disjointed look at personal and national debt in America.  There is a decent amount of interviews given by not only regular victims of credit card debt but also from individuals who are educated in this subject such as consumer advocates and financial experts.  A bit more organization in the presentation of material would have been better.

Looking past the shortcomings listed above and concentrating solely on the subject of debt, this program reveals some alarming trends by credit card companies, the government, and corporations that want to part you from your money using whatever means they feel are good for them but not good for you.

Whether it is credit lenders trying to exploit college students or companies trying to induce recent bankruptcy filers to again mire themselves in financial trouble, this is just another day at the office for them, business as usual.  When it comes to ethics and professional behavior, it really isn't a big consideration in day to day affairs for some credit card companies and banks.  As far as collecting on what you owe them, it is commonplace to experience rude and intimidating behavior from some debt collectors.  When it comes to gathering information about a person's credit history and buying practices, there is evidence of data manipulation and disregarding people's rights to privacy in financial affairs.

When looking at numbers too, these don't paint a very pretty picture.  Over 4 billion credit card offers a year are sent to the public.  Credit card fees have risen 160 percent over the last 5 years.  Between 1994 and 2004, over 10 million Americans filed for bankruptcy.  The average household nowadays averages over 9000 dollars in debt and they spend more than 1300 dollars a year in interest payments.  In 2004, thirty different states sued banks regarding predatory and discriminatory practices.

Don't count on the government to help out or be a consumer watchdog regarding these affairs either.  They're complicit in events that worsen the situation.  President Bush introduced new bankruptcy legislation that makes it harder for middle class citizens to file for bankruptcy and get a second chance.  Several presidents have borrowed very heavily from Social Security and pension funds to make interest payments owed on the national debt.  So much for the public's best interests at heart.  When it comes to examining and investigating the unscrupulous behavior of these credit card companies and lending institutions, very little action, if any, is taken and in most cases they aren't being held responsible for their harmful activities.

Although some of the subject matter in this program may be a little disheartening at times, it is still a good look at what really goes on in this country regarding debt, fiscal irresponsibility, and the diminishing middle class society in America, among other things.",1181347200,28,2920,5.172340425531915

2799521,5,B000OU081M,"Maxed Out: Hard Times, Easy Credit and the Era of Predatory Lenders is an independent feature-length documentary that chronicles abusive practices in the credit card industry. It uses interviews with creditors, debtors, academics, and others to illustrate its story. Its premises is that banks and other creditors deliberately market to people who are more likely to have problems paying and that the creditors benefit from connections to government, the debt collection industry, and from lawmaker apathy. Many viewers would probably find this an awkward piece considering that it is dispiriting as three of its subjects recount the suicides of relatives. But nevertheless,it provides information on how lenders and creditors make money. Overall,it can definitely a big help to avoid their  egregious practices by acquiring this knowledge and how not to fall into their trap of being as the title suggests, ""maxed out"" from debt.",1413072000,,930,5.458333333333333

2799526,4,B000OU081M,"Before I write anything, I want to be clear that I agree with those who believe people have a responsibility to manage their own finances. Period. Many people in debt / foreclosure / bankruptcy are in those positions because they spent far more than they were able and indeed wish to blame someone else for their misfortune.  Take responsibility for your own actions - I agree 100%.  Hence my rating of 4 stars not 5, for the documentary fails to mention those that abuse the system.  And plenty do.

Now, with my disclaimer out of the way, this is a MUST-SEE and not sensationalized.  Banks do need poor people and people with bad credit, because they don't make any money off people who pay their bills in full every month.  But that does not excuse the predatory practices they engage in, and will continue to engage in until we have some people in government who weren't elected with campaign contributions from banks (and other big business).

The program does what every documentary with a message should do - it focuses on several stories and interjects a fair amount of facts (and facts should be checked no matter who provides them).  How can anyone argue credit card companies should not recruit non-working new college students for credit cards?  They know full well the students have no means to pay, yet they issue credit - and continue to issue it even after the person is dead.  It's shameful.  Similar practices repeat with mortgage lending.  Again, one cannot argue many financial institutions (banks and otherwise) target the most vulnerable of society.  And they do so to achieve the results witnessed in ""Maxed Out"".  While not a particular focus point in this film, the loss of small town banks has helped accelerate the rapid abuse within the system.

See it - form your own opinion - do your own research - and then take a look at the financial companies you do business with.  This documentary is worth your time.  Now, review my first paragraph again before posting any comments.",1389312000,,2004,4.745664739884393

2799532,1,B000OU081M,"This is your typical hidden agenda video that tries to scare Americans into believing that the banking system is out to get them.  The parents in this video, while I feel for them and their loss to suicide, represent a tiny fraction of the population that goes through such events.  Bankruptcy laws are in place to protect the mental well-being of people and prevent suicides or other extreme measures that come from financial stress.  The parents also make it very clear that they did not take any time to teach their children about financial responsibility, nor did they engage in their children's lives, and they themselves also never really learned much about financial responsibility either.  This is a common problem with our society - people are quick to make themselves into victims.

The video is also very dated, a lot of legislation has come about since 2005 to help protect American consumers from predatory lending practices that ran rampant throughout the housing bubble (again, this video focuses in on an anomaly), as well as reform banking practices.  My biggest issue is that this video attempts to convey opinion as fact, using outliers of statistical data, and manipulate emotion in a tactless manner to sway public opinion without presenting the big picture.  Without credit, without banks, without lending, the quality of life for millions of Americans would greatly drop.

What we need to do is educate the public about responsible use of credit, financial mapping, the money and banking system, and then make sure we use our political might (yes, the vote) to keep people in office who help protect us from abusive tactics that banks may use.",1366416000,3,1666,4.9891696750902526

2799536,1,B000OU081M,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this before I wasted my time.
I was hoping for a good financial program that showed how the personal misuse of credit cards has led to huge personal debt, and how one should wisely use credit.

Instead, this is a whiny program on how it's ""All the Banks' Faults"", and how these innocent people were held down and forced to apply for credit cards, then rack up hundreds of dollars of debt they couldn't pay back. Apparently the banks held guns to their heads? Or held their loved ones for ransom? I'm not sure how the banks managed to force people to go into debt, since I personally have never had a bank force me to open up a line of credit (and I live UNDER the poverty line....according to this show, I'm a prime target for these ""evil corporations""...yet, I've never been forced to do anything against my will by the banks).

If you believe in personal responsibility, and want information on living a responsible debt-free financial life, then don't bother with this documentary. ""Maxed Out"" is made for the people out there with a ""Victim Mentality"" who want to blame everyone else on the problems that they themselves created.",1357344000,2,1173,4.580952380952381

2799539,2,B000OU081M,"Plusses:

The movie shows...

* Politicians are actively selling We, the people, out for lobbyists and the credit card companies
* Credit card and lending companies/banks are growing taking larger and larger risks just to get us to accept more debt
* Too much debt harms individuals and families, sometimes even driving people to suicide
* Collections agencies will do anything possible to get money out of debtors
* Pawn shops (except the Las Vegas one on TV) are an indication of when people are about to hit rock bottom

In short: nothing new.  In hopes to help the non-rabid partisan make a decision on whether to view the movie, some balance is required.

Negatives:

The movie...

* Proves its bias by focusing blame on the government and CC companies, never once encouraging people to live debt free (even with Dave Ramsey in the movie, who's entire mantra is to live debt free!).  This is a double failure on the part of the Director because no administration (Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, or otherwise) has done much of anything to prevent what this movie is all about. In fact, America is looking at a financial catastrophe because the government has engaged in the same practices the individuals in this movie have.  If he weren't so partisan, this movie would be more relevant today (much like ""Inside Job"" is still relevant).
* Misses an incredible opportunity at helping by encouraging the interviewers, participants, people who have lost family to suicide over debt, etc, to simply say: ""Teach your children about debt and why they need to avoid it. Take part in your college students' life and try to prevent them from doing something stupid.""
* Seems to absolve individuals for applying for, using, maxing out, and then destroying their financial lives over, a credit card.  CC companies are unethical, callous beasts - always have been. Elected officials aren't doing much but arguing - always have been.  The only person to stop it is you - this entire notion was absent in this movie.

So to sum up, Maxed Out is a flawed execution of a noble concept. Instead of actually trying to help people understand ways to avoid becoming saddled with crippling debt and alternatives to get out from underneath, it implies that individuals are simple, helpless prey for CC companies while an ineffective government (only Republicans though) simply watches.  Look: foolish people do foolish things, and there definitely is some measure of responsibility owned by CC companies (who continue to send pre-authorized cards to people who have killed themselves over having too much debt, etc), but the core of the problem is not predatory lending practices: it's Americans who have no control and no sense of consequence over their actions.  Deal with the problem vice the symptoms and things may change.

Unfortunately, this film opts to show only symptoms. Without a firm grasp of the problem, a viable solution is lost to the viewer, and we are worse off for it.  How disappointing.",1342569600,2,2987,4.920318725099602

It's appalling that these people are shocked that credit card companies actually expect them to pay for what they buy and, if they don't, to charge them interest.

As the story goes on she starts to behave like the evil credit card companies murdered her son.  Ridiculous.

It also tells a story of how whenever we cut spending we're firing all the police, teachers, and throwing old folks onto the streets.  The reality is that politicians (and these movie makers) know that saying that freaks people out and they get to keep spending your money.  The morons in this country fall for it almost every time.

How about actually reading the paperwork you're signing.  How about living below your means so that when bad things happen you aren't left with debt up to your eyeballs and nothing to show for it.

2799545,5,B000OU081M,"I saw this movie a few years ago, 2006 I think, and knew about the credit fraud, the bank fraud already, but also the one thing that still isn't addressed for a housing bubble; Real Estate Fraud. I heard a guy, back in the early 2000's who estimated the price of houses for a living, and he said that prices were artificially estimated high. I was house hunting, it was obvious. I bought a house one month before the crash, knowing better, but pressured by family members, friends, and friends dabbling in real estate. Needless to say, there was some shenanigans in paper work, that we uncovered later, that our real estate person didn't even know about.

I also watched 5 pawn shops created in our neighborhood go up as real estate prices dropped by half. One does influence the other.

Despite the other reviewers, this movie shows how people are DECEIVED into Debt. Where are the TRUE conservatives to advocate that Banks not FORCE people to borrow beyond their means? Thats how evil the good people have become, and I think Dave Ramsey secretly knows this. A true warning and neccessary film.

If you have a house, either pay it off quick, or walk away from it now, because it is the albatross around the throat of America. Also, tear up your cards, use cash as much as possible, and use a credit union or small bank. Because they will get you eventually. They used to treat us with respect.

The most moving parts are the testimonies of families affected by others that had debt levels they can't handle.  I won't spoil the movie, but what I will say is that it was extremely moving.  I can relate to the 2 stories about the families with kids that got credit cards as freshman in college.  That was me.  I am just so thankful that I didn't end up at a point where I felt there wasn't a way out.  I'm working hard to become debt free.... I can't wait for the day I scream it at the top of my lungs.

2799549,3,B000OU081M,"This documentary about American credit card debt, and debt in general, came out at just the wrong time.  Because it appeared in 2007, just before the bursting housing bubble and major credit plunge, this film was outdated nearly as soon as it was released, and would almost certainly have been significantly different and more timely if it had been made only a couple of years later...bad timing, bad luck.

The filmmakers focused on a handful of stories to highlight the problems of credit-debt in the USA.  Sadly, none of the stories were really told in enough detail to show all of the ins and outs of how people got into their overwhelming debt in the first place, though a few were mentioned: college student over-spending, death of a spouse and loss of income (without making any adjustment to lifestyle), being declared dead without actually dying, low net pay while in military service and growing bills at home and ongoing house, car and trailer payments, gambling debts, lack of understanding of credit terms and falling prey to companies offering credit, etc.

Some of the situations truly make you feel for the people in debt, while others who were in debt that was clearly avoidable make you wonder, ""What were they thinking!?""

Of course, credit companies are demonized in this show, not completely unfairly, but, at the same time there is not nearly a strong enough message that when you borrow money you are expected to pay it back - HELLO!

Anyway, the quality of the show itself, its filming, flow, editing, etc. was just marginal.  It had only a loosely developed storyline, and the major punchline that could have been delivered in just about any direction: toward borrowers, lenders, the government, et al., was not made.

All in all this was only an average treatment of a significant problem.

Now, if you don't pay the money back, YOU ARE STEALING.  That's right.  You are a THIEF.  Taking something that isn't yours and not giving it back is the definition of theft.  How on earth can this movie rightfully argue that those who borrow money and don't return it are always ""victims""?

i was bothered by one glaring omission in this film, and that is when the film spoke about the national debt... hey america, answer me this... to whom do we owe this debt?  The Federal Reserve that's who. The Federal Reserve which is a private central bank, which prints money out of thin air, loans it to the government, then your and my tax dollars go to pay the interest on that loan back to the FED! It's all a big scam.  the constitution provides that congress has the power to print money, but our country has been taken over by a private consortium of banks and it is these bankers that are basically ruling the country. the president answers to them. our gov't issues nothing but bonds and you and i are carrying around fiat paper money that is backed by nothing.

i was dismayed that by the end this film just became an anti-bush piece.  now, i don't like bush either. he's about as awful as one gets, but if you think any of the democratic presidents cares more about the average american than repubs then you're just naive and deceiving yourself. go listen to alex jones or david icke and learn some truth.

2799555,5,B000OU081M,"I am fairly well read in this topic, at least for the lay person. I found this movie worthwhile. The problem with documentaries is that compared to spending the same amount of time reading, you get an awful lot LESS information and a lot MORE emotion. Still, it wasn't a shallow and heart-string pulling as some other documentaries *cough Michael Moore* can be.

I also have a soft spot for the material in this one because I agree with it so thoroughly. Excess debt destroys household finances and the government is quite literally in bed either by appointing ex industry shills as heads of agencies or just straight old lobbying, both of which are to me abhorrent bastardizations of democracy.

This movie was interesting in when it was set. I haven't checked but it seems it was released around the top of the bubble. It follows one realtor around a bit in Nevada and I bet that if they did a follow-up with her now things would be quite different. She talked, for example, about the $450k house she personally bought and sold (her own house) for twice that and how it was just a simple tract house. And today 60% of houses in Nevada are under water. her best line was, paraphrased, if you look rich eventually you will be. She had a nice luxury car, btw and a plate on one of her cars matching the name of the subdivision she sells houses in.

Personally, as I become more educated in finance I become more sympathetic with those who aren't. To be experts in every field that touches our lives is not realistic, from health to mechanics to finances to home construction, etc.. We pay taxes and expect better from those who are literally paid to defend our interests and through the poison of lobbying these interests are continually ambushed.

So, this movie is entertaining. You can't find a long essay about it but it's pretty watchable and certainly illuminating to some of its audience.",1260144000,,1894,4.611275964391691
2799556,1,B000OU081M,"I saw this film because I have an interest in the subject and because it was one of the few available on Netflix streaming.

The biggest problem with this movie is bad planning.  It started strong, but then fell apart.  I don't think it is as misleading as other mockumentaries.

First the good:
Approximately the first 1 hour was compelling.  The movie had real life stories of people who had problems with credit card debt.  It let people talk about how they got into debt and the consequences of that debt.

It also portrayed a radio talk show host whose show seemed to be about helping people with money, and briefly told his story of almost losing everything, and slowly and painfully recovering, and crying when he had to give up his fancy car (was it a Porsche?).  He even made the point that we think we're entitled to these things but we're not unless we pay for them.

The film showed a Minnesota collections company, and went to great lengths to show how this particular collections company wasn't entirely evil because it treated people with respect when it performed collections, unlike comparison collection companies described in other scenes.  These was compelling, and looked like it might promise some balanced views in the piece.

In the beginning the film raised interesting questions such as why credit card companies pursue 18 year olds without income, why FICO score calculations do not contain income as a component, why credit is offered freely to people who have no ability to pay, and why credit card companies target people who have previously been bankrupt and people who are likely to go bankrupt.  These were compelling, and sounded like they promised to be insightful.

I think the film even made a good case for establishing that the credit card companies have a vested interest in restricting the consumers ability to utilize bankruptcy - although it did not give much information on the history of bankruptcy law.  (It seems to me that bankruptcy law had been more strict, was made more lenient in the 90s, and then become more strict in 2005, but I don't know much about bankruptcy.  The film only covered how it became more strict in 2005.).

So I thought the film started well.

The bad:
At about 1 hour in, after a compelling opening, the film went off the rails.

Suddenly the film was talking about the government.  It makes sense to talk about the government's role in bankruptcy law and credit card regulation, and for the first 10 minutes it was tolerable, but then it became obvious that the film believed government should be the solution and that government was not doing enough.  There was no examination of the American individual's role in the credit card problem.

And it got worse.  The film did not actually examine government's role in the credit card problem.  It did not interview anyone in the government (a first hand source) or anyone who studied and had expertise on the government's role in the credit card market (a second hand source) it simply resorted to clips of news footage and cspan, interspersed with frames of text for the filmmakers to interject their own viewpoints and commentary, and from a filmmaking perspective, provide at least some narrative to (poorly) tie together these scenes.  But at least the film did show how gullible Congress seemed to be when listening to the executive vice presidents of the credit card companies.

And it got worse.  There were a number of clips featuring George W. Bush.  And some of them were clips of Bush saying silly things.  But some of them were clips of Bush saying things that weren't so silly, but were taken out of context and framed by other clips that made Bush sound silly.  So as I watched this film alledgedly about Credit Card debt, all of a sudden I found myself confronted by these obviously manipulative film techniques that seem to be blatantly directed at attacking George W. Bush.  And its not clear at all to me what this had to do with the first part of the film - the part about credit cards.

And it got worse.  There was a scene where Congress was discussing the 2005 Bankruptcy bill - or so we are told.  Except its not clear what is going on, because it is edited down to less than a minute, and the filmmakers decided to loop the sound of the Speaker of the House banging a gavel saying ""without objection ... the gentleman from Florida"" and playing it over and over on top of the *ending* of the speeches (when representatives are *always* in a rush to finish their speeches within their alloted time) of 3 or 4 **Democrat** legislators making it look like a presumably Republican Speaker of the House was cutting off an entire lineup of Democrat speakers and not allowing any of them to speak about the problems with the Bankruptcy legislation at all.  It seemed so unfair!  Except that it was all film making trickery.  And that's appalling in a documentary.

There is nothing more dishonest that filmakers can do than editing material, splicing in sound, and presenting it as factual.  Its like photoshopping guns and hostages into photos in the New York times.  And to be so blatant about it loses credibility with the people who make policy and know how these tricks work.  And to lie like this is incredibly destructive to the audience that this film is probably trying to help - how many people are going to watch this film and walk away believing that the government actually works the way they present it - controlled by a political party who has it out for the little guy and coldly and unfairly ignores disagreement and debate from anyone who cares about the individual?

At this point in the film, after raising so many interesting questions, the film goes lazy and answers them all by pointing the finger at government.

Like so many other reviewers point out, this film had the potential to educate people about how the Credit Card companies work, about the problems that credit cards can create, about the demographics and statistics of credit card usage and debt, about the role that individuals play and about how they can more intelligently manage their money (the filmmakers did, after all, splice in old footage on personal finance education as well as footage of a personal finance radio show) - but instead the film started looking to the government to solve the problems and utterly ignored the consumer's role in the debt market.  Not only that, but it took a very anti-Republican and specifically anti George W. Bush stance in an allegedly documentary film about a subject that didn't need to involve partisanship, and did so at the expense of examining the issue.

Another scene that was very partisan and disingenuous - the filmmakers cut in a scene featuring Ronald Reagan as an actor in an old film with which I am not familiar, and I'm sure most viewers are also not familiar with it because it is too old and too un-notable.  The scene involves Ronald Reagan in a position of authority, talking to a character who works at a bank and is explaining to Reagan's character that there is no money left in the vault.  Ronald Reagan's character seems to suggest unethical behavior - that they can lie and find a way to misrepresent how much money is in the bank - and with that he winks at the bank character.  The way that this scene was framed by the clips surrounding it, I felt like the filmmakers were trying to lead me to believe that this was Ronald Reagan, as president, making bank policy for the United States.  Its hard to see that the filmmakers didn't intend this - even if the audience is supposed to recognize that this was Reagan as an actor, the clip's use was as a lead-in to another clip that featured Ronald Reagan as president and a segment on US credit card/bank policy, and so the clip nevertheless served as an analogy for how the filmmakers felt about US bank policy.  It is very difficult for me to understand why the filmmakers chose a clip with Reagan instead of any other corrupt banker movie if not to be disingenuous with the audience, and that is the cardinal sin of documentaries.  Lying to the audience like this earns documentaries 1-star ratings.

I already mentioned that at the 1 hour point the film went off the rails.  The film continued its off-rail adventure through the wild frontier of national debt and social security, which have absolutely nothing to do with the credit card industry and the borrowing decisions that individual Americans make that create the debt problems we saw at the beginning of the movie.

My guess is that the filmmakers were trying to show parallelism between the debt that individual Americans have and the debt that the US Government has.  However, in reading some of the other review comments left by other Amazon viewers, it seems that the audience has conflated the two issues.  It seems that some audience members actually believe that ""The National Debt"" is the total of each and every Americans' credit card balances, and that George W. Bush borrowed from Social security to pay off the national credit card debt.

To be clear - the ""national debt"" is not related to your credit card debt, and if you walked away from this film thinking that it was, then this film has utterly failed.

And again - as this film explored this national debt/borrowing from Social Security issue, it again dove into partisanship.  There was a sequence of recent presidents (post Reagan only) with text about their contribution to this national debt/social security issue, as the film presented it.  For each president, it explained how that president made the problem worse.  Except for Bill Clinton, where the language was softened and it was explained that while Clinton was president, the world got worse around him - but it wasn't his fault; not like the other presidents.  To be clear - Bill Clinton was the only democrat president in this sequence.  The film had harsh criticism for each of the Republican presidents, but soft criticism for Bill Clinton.  Such partisanship has no place in a good documentary about credit cards.  Of course, the national debt and social security borrowing have little place in a good documentary about credit cards, either.

Once you reach the epilogue, the wheels completely fall off the bus.  In one of the epilogue scenes, we revisit the pawn shop owner who talks about customers that have come in 15 times to ask for body armor for their sons in Iraq because George Bush won't buy it for them.  (What does this have to do with credit card debt?)  Then the pawn shop owner talks about some ""blue collar machinists"" who did not want to pay more taxes to provide health care to people who could not afford it.  The pawn shop owner sees this as a contradiction, because to him the blue collar workers were the people who could not afford health care, and he insisted ""they don't get it!  They just don't get it!""  (What does this have to do with credit card debt?)  And it's with that scene, as the pawn shop owner closes some arbitrary french doors in his shop, that the film goes to black and resumes David Bowie/Queen's ""Under Pressure"" song, with which the film had opened, as if the filmmakers thought they had just made the most important point of the entire film.  Except that it had nothing to do with credit cards.

And then we got the trailing credit clips - all backed by David Bowie/Queen's ""Under Pressure""
* A confusing clip about the personal finance talk show mentioning a special price on bed mattresses - was this to remind us about the personal finance show showing us how to spend our money better?  Or was it to point out that mattresses/beds along with the other basics in life were difficult for the average American to afford?
* Another clip with George W. Bush - this time talking about Disney World - was this clip intended to be another attack at George W. Bush, with the point being incredulity at how the president can be so out of touch with credit card debt as to talk about blowing money on Disney World?  Or was this clip intended to demonstrate that Americans' priorities are out of order?  Or was this clip intended to demonstrate that advertising for useless things is so pervasive that the American Dream is to go to Disney World?  The message of this clip is confusing and completely lost because of how many times this film portrayed George W. Bush in a negative light.  This is just another clip that is out of place and probably pointlessly unrelated to credit card debt.
* Closure with the Abtronic - this was humorous and well placed, an example of the kinds of clips that should show up in the trailing credits.
* Interesting question about high interest rates on credit cards - except the credits are rolling and this film never answered the question, so it is enraging to see it brought up now, still unsatisfactorily answered, after the film wasted so much time on political drivel.
* A scene with Bill Clinton explaining that his credit card - his American Express card - was rejected when buying books - was this to demonstrate the mistakes that credit card companies make?  Wasn't it explained that important people got special treatment without mistakes?  Was this to show that even Bill Clinton has credit card problems?  Isn't he a multi-millionaire?  My guess is that the filmmakers thought it was cute and funny.  And it is.  But it doesn't fit, and it is another example of what makes this a bad film.
* A return to the education video - ""Do girls have to learn all this about credit too?""  - Is this a commentary on sexism?  A commentary on how gender roles have evolved in the US over the past 60 years?  A commentary on how young single women still expect men to buy them drinks at the bar and expensive engagement rings and outrageously priced weddings so that the women can still fritter their money away on frivolous things, get into credit card debt, and then saddle their future husbands with it (a reference to the abtronic scene)???  I don't get it.  Another failure.
* News clip closure for the women who disappeared from the gas station - so she also committed suicide --- this probably belonged earlier in the film when talking about the other suicides, not in the closing credits.
* An INCREDIBLY interesting and poignant scene about how special people are given special treatment by the credit score companies --- WHAT IS THIS DOING AS THE NEXT TO LAST CLIP AT THE END OF THE CREDITS??!?!?!?  THIS IS WHAT THIS FILM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT!!!  AND THIS IS INCREDIBLY INTERESTING!!!

As a documentary, the film should have offered us statistics and hard data about people in debt and credit cards - but it offered virtually nothing in hard data.

Overall, this movie seems like a student project that started with a good idea, reached a deadline, and while being hastily finished to meet the deadline meandered off into the students' personal philosophies as filler for missing material.  And then they tried to wrap a bow on it with a closing they thought was clever and poignant but just ... wasn't.

2799560,4,B000OU081M,"The first half of Maxed Out should be required viewing for anyone thinking about getting a credit card for themselves (or especially for their children).  Viewers are presented with sobering stats about predatory lending practices, mafia-like interest rates and the unspoken desire of banks to see their clients ""get behind"" and tread water by paying the minimum payments for years or even decades.

The film takes the noble and tough love approach by showing the mistakes made by people who find themselves in credit card debt and the blissfully ignorant attitude many pay to skyrocketing interest payments and compounding late fees.  For irresponsible people with bad credit, a $50 purchase on a credit card will likely turn into $200 by the time it is no longer on their balance.  By not making responsible choices, people throw away thousands of dollars each year, and greedy bankers get richer and richer.

I was halfway through watching Maxed Out when I thought it was one of the most important documentaries I had ever seen...and then it falls apart.  Like all documentaries these days, George W. Bush had to make an appearance as the creator of everything bad in the world, as the man personally responsible for everything that has gone wrong for the last eight years.  The film provides far-reaching ideas about how Bush's relationship with bankers and his desire to pass tougher bankruptcy laws somehow causes people to go to Best Buy and purchase $5,000 plasma televisions they can't afford.

Sadly, the filmmakers lose focus on the real story: that people make poor choices to get into bad situations.  All of the check-cashing stores and pre-approved credit card offers won't make a responsible person do the wrong thing.

That doesn't fly, freedom means you are on your own.  You are free to refuse credit...  and I wish you would because the exuberant amount of fiat money in the system inflates all pricing for everyone, even for those who are financially responsible.  This filmmaker obviously went to the propaganda film school of Michael Moore.  The formula is simple, show half the story, emphasizing one side for effect.  It's a disservice.

For instance, the 'filmmaker' heavily glosses over the majority of borrowers that game the system for every drop they can, default to chapter 11, and walk away scot free.

It is the day many of us sink further into debt buying crap our friends and family probably don't need nor want. Couple that with a destabilizing economy and you've got serious issues to think about. The question we need to ask ourselves is ""why?"" Why do we feel the need to spend more than we make (or may ever make)?

The tough answer is here in MAXED OUT, writer/director James D. Scurlock's first feature length documentary.

I think many of us know the answer but simply refuse to acknowledge it: we want to keep up with the Jones'. They have a new car, we need a new car. They have a new washer/dryer, we need a new one. It is a cycle being perpetuated by the credit industry and we, the consumers, have been drawn to it like moths to a flamethrower.

Maxed Out gives us insights that should make one angry and fearful. Predatory lenders like MBNA, Capitol One, and other credit card companies target those that are least likely to be able to afford credit. Why? Because these are the people who max out their cards then pay the minimum monthly amounts until ...either bankrupt or death do them part. It's a marriage made in Hell and it continues to this day. College students who enter a new campus are likely to find tables set up near their dorms offering sign ups for new credit cards. Why? Again, because they can't afford it (sadly these are the people who end up in the worst situations, often dangling from their necks in dorm room closets).

Add to this fact that we are now in the worst financial/debt crisis in U.S. history (end of 2008) and is there any wonder why? George Bush and his buddies at MBNA passed a new law that puts tighter restrictions on filing for bankruptcy, making those who really need assistance the least likely to get it (but it's okay to spend 700 billion taxpayer dollars to bail out banks that caused this debacle). Heinous. And do the credit card companies have to answer to anyone? Morally or ethically? Not that I've seen.

The credit card industry makes for a perfect subject as there are so much abuse from both its users and its issuers so I was hoping that the documentary would not limit its to the sleazy practices of the credit industry and how government has not done much to keep these people in check. That story has been told many times yet the angle that would have made it more interesting is how we as consumers fall prey to our own greed, entitlement, and how some really good people who can't make ends meet also can fall prey to a gangster-like industry.

But our accountability is thrown out the window and bulk of the documentary tries to expose a known sleaziness and in my opinion those telling the tale resort to exploiting their subjects in a very heavy-handed matter. Did they have to talk to resort to milking tears from mothers who lost their children to suicide when the kids could not keep up with payments? A missing woman is used for similar purposes as are the mother of a developmentally challenged man, and a war veteran. The documentary also uses a cheap propaganda film from archives for maximum snarkiness and takes pot shots at some many people, including some who have done some pretty good things when it comes to training people not to live beyond their means.

I knew that it would not be a good documentary when I started looking at my watch within the first half-hour. The documentary beat the same drums over and over again with a documentary by the numbers check-list that I assume has or would make a great 20 minute story for a show like 60 Minutes. Even the title is deceptive as I was expecting to see a documentary of the misuse of credit and how the industry preys on those who do the worst job of managing it.

The beauty of sharecropping, from the landowner's point of view, was that labor  was much cheaper.  Slaves had to be housed and fed; sharecroppers didn't.  And with sharecropping, white people could be owned as well as black people.

The best kind of slavery, again from the ""slaveholder's' point of view is invisible slavery.  The ""slaves"" don't even know they are slaves, therefore they don't rebel.

The slick marketers of debt, like predators in nature, prey on the most vulnerable; the young, the old, the unsophisticated, and the desperate.

She tells us how the bank guaranteed her mortgage based on the projected increased value of the house from its original price, after completion. We are told this is the exact same accounting procedure that Enron used.

There are some facts that this DVD makes clear. America, once a country where people were forced to live within their means has become a nation of debtors. Our indebtedness has been encouraged and even exploited by politicians, and credit card companies who tell us they are everywhere we want to be. With the complicity of congress, credit card companies are sapping the financial vitality of the American family.

Almost all politicians have told us that we should continue to consume. If it isn't Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger telling us from the front of an auto dealership that we need a new car, it's George W. Bush who told us after 9/11, to hell with sacrifices--just buy (and get into more debt).

In the 1980's President Ronald Reagan encouraged deregulation. Banks, once unable to operate in other states or float credit cards could now do so. Knowing that we could have something now instead of later was tempting for too many people. As the DVD reveals, the banks found a master marketer who suggested that they have zero percent interest ""come-ons.""

Then, there was targeting the right population. College kids were especially targeted with free Frisbees, school tee shirts, or any other gimmick that was given just for filling out an application. Calculated in this decision was to lure kids with future income potential and limited current income to make them debtors for life. The full-time working, non-student, eighteen year olds were usually rejected because they were more likely to make the monthly payments.

Enter MBNA. They write the new bankruptcy law that the 109th republican dominated Congress will adopt. This Congress has its hands in the pockets of the banks and credit card companies, and they make it quite clear that their obligation is to represent their largest contributors rather than their constituents. In the words of Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the purpose of the bill is ""to make Americans more responsible.""

It's unfortunate that the good senator didn't feel the same way about the credit card companies, which were then allowed to charge rates once thought of as criminal e.g. 35% on delinquent credit card payments. (Just think. At that rate, one in three borrowers could default and the credit card companies and banks would still make money)! Additional ""fees"" are added for processing, lateness, etc. Providian, which tried to lure people with low interest rates, withheld deposit or simply shredded payments so they could charge late fees and raise interest rates.

Another genius decision was to maintain low monthly payment minimums. This will guarantee that a $10,000 balance would require payments of more than $18,000 to pay off. It would also lull the consumer into feeling that the burden was not too much to bear, and that the card could still be used.

But the banks were still not short on ingenuity in coming up with more ways to make money via credit cards. They could sell their debt to collectors who were ready to dun borrowers and take them to court for judgments and liens.

There is a heavy-handed part to this story that I was uncomfortable with. It was the tragedy of two mothers whose children committed suicide because they had acquired too many credit cards and could not pay them back the enormous amount of debt they accumulated. Obviously, this decision was driven by their own thoughts rather than by collection coersion. They tell their story to Congress asking them to change these laws as they face an array of bankers and lawyers. They knew nothing would happen, and nothing did. (But at least Congress did investigate the important stuff, like if Roger Clemens was using performance-enhancing drugs)!

The intentional irony here was a number of these bankers and company executives telling Congress: ""We are sensitive to the needs of our customers.""

And some day pigs will fly.

November 5, 2009: The credit card companies that are so sensitive to the needs of their customers are raising interest rates up the maximum currently allowed by law. That means 29% and 30% for customers with outstanding credit.

2799591,4,B000OU081M,"It does seem as though the american way is to go in debt now and pay later. Unlike our ancestors from yester-year we like to have everything now. Why earn the money to purchase expensive item A? Just put it on credit, and unlike your great grandparents you can have instant satisfaction now (they actually had to earn the money, put the work in first, and have a real value behind that dollar they were spending. How yesterday). I mean the credit card companies say you can pay for it, so you must be able to handle it right? Nah, they wouldn't allow you to bite off more than you can chew.

  If you want a real expose on how the rich keep getting richer while the poor continue to get poorer watch this movie. Here is just some of what you will see.

* George W. Bush's top campaign contributor was MBNA (credit card company) who just so happened to write a Bush supported bill to re-write the bankruptcy laws. Want to know what this means for you? Watch the movie.

* The credit card company target college students who have NO INCOME. Some of these kids get so far into credit card debt (beyond school debt) that they can't get themselves out. The movie tells the story of two such individuals who eventually commited suicide. These same credit card company however will not give credit cards to 18 and 19 years olds who hold jobs. Nope, they know they can pay their bills on time.

* The people the credit card companies target the most are the working poor. They know they can only afford to make minimum payments. Therefore, they keep them enslaved to debt their entire life. They never have a chance to be anything other than poor. This movie tells a tale of a financial specialist who came to talk to exec's from a big credit company. She told them if they would stop giving credit to those who are ""least likely to be able to pay their bills"" they would cut their risk by over 50%. The CEO/President spoke up at that point and said, ""But that's how we make all our money."" Who are the one's who can't pay their bills? The working poor! The credit card companies target the poor, take advantage of them, and send them into financial ruin.

* So how can these credit card companies afford to give credit to people they know can't pay? 1. They get minimum payments with inflated interest as long as they can. 2. Once the individual stops paying they tack on hugs fees to the debt up to 180 days in non-payment. After that they sell the debt (after inflated fees are added) to another company at a reduced rate. However, since they tripled the amount of your loan in fees they can sell that debt at a profit.

* Companies that buy the dilinquent debt of credit card companies will absolutely harrass you. They will call you day and night. They will contact your family, your neighbor, and call your employer. They will garnish your wages. Once story had them calling a man who just lost his wife. She killed herself due to the debt she caused (and subsequently hid from) her family. The company that bought the debt told the family something along the lines, ""If you would have payed more attention maybe she wouldn't be dead."" That's a nice thing to come home from a funeral to.

* The credit card system is made to make the rich richer, send the middle class into the poor house, and make the poor poorer. Both the Demoncrats and Repugnicans have sold out to the credit card companies.

* You should watch this movie/documentary. Teach your children about the bondage of debt, and for God sake don't fall victim to their financial enslavement.",1202601600,3,3551,4.449230769230769

2799593,4,B000OU081M,"This is a powerful documentary for me mainly because it hits close to home.  I've known some people who got themselves into deep doo-doo with credit problems and have taken a long time to dig themselves out.

I find it interesting that the negative reviews for the film argue that it doesn't mention ""personal responsibility"" and places the blame for all of this at the feet of the corporations and the government.  I'll agree its fairly one-sided in that regard but when the problem has been created by the corporations and the government to begin with, then that's arguably where most of the blame *should* lay.  The evidence is at the end when the congressional committee doesn't even question the corporate wonks - just lets them make their statements and ""have a nice day"".  Yeah, nice.  And lets blame the borrowers...

I give this four stars because I'll agree somewhat with the one-sidedness.  But it also loses a star because I don't think it really goes into the psychological hell that people experience when they run into massive debt.  Why would credit card companies provide offers to people they consider to be high risks for bankruptcy?  Wouldn't it make sense to just ignore that group and not try to get their business?  Of course not - for two reasons.  1) (which was mentioned in the film) the companies don't want to lose any money - *ANY* money - they don't need to.  2) (and this wasn't really covered in the film) the companies (I think) know that the high risk people have problems with money.  Just like people who have problems with gambling, alcohol, drugs, or sex, I think these companies know that people who are ""high risk"" for bankruptcy are also some of the biggest spenders and worst managers of their own finances - and they take advantage of it.  I would have liked to have seen more development of this potential angle.

This film is an excellent wakeup call and provides some great information for people who may not be aware of the way things are in this country.  It shows just how deep the companies and the government are in this together.  For that, its worth more than the price.

I would love to see an update - since most of the stuff in here is from 2005, I want to know how the Nevada real estate agent is doing these days.  Is the median price for a home still over $268,000?  I believe it may not be.

I also want to know if some of the people interviewed in this film are still alive.

2799594,3,B000OU081M,"This is a good film that illustrates the trouble people can get into with credit debt, but remember that these are people that got into that trouble on their own.  No one forced them to sign on for credit, and no one blacked out the fine print that they should have read, but probably didn't.

Face it, people sign on the line and ignore the rules, then sit around wondering how they got in their mess.  And then they do it again (and again!), as shown by the folks who have 6, 8, or 10+ credit cards.  Some get the extra cards to play the balance transfer game, but then they end up being unable to resist that new decorative plate/plasma TV/concert tickets and they charge up the new card as fast as the old.  Most just get a new card because the last one 'maxed out' and there's more stuff they want to buy.

Responsible spendiing and personal budgeting will be the only way that people get out and stay out of debt.  Blaming the credit card company, the economy, or the President because of debt created by luxury items is whiny fingerpointing.  And while this movie does an admirable job of painting the credit industry as an evil empire, it simultaneously implies that many of its 'victims' are hapless wide-eyed rubes who got suckered.

Credit is a business.  Yes, they are out to make money and make their stockholders happy, just like the Gap or Starbucks or McDonalds.  But what they offer is attractive to people because basically they're offering the opportunity to buy things that can be paid for 'later'.  Should they be stricter about limiting who they give credit to?  Probably, but then they would have to put up with accusations of fairness and discrimination when denying credit.

However, Maxed Out does a disservice to its viewers in not illustrating, or even mentioning, the number of solutions and programs that the major credit card companies actually offer to help cardholders pay off their debt.  There are divisions in these companies whose sole job is to offer programs and set up more affordable payment plans to cardholders who are in trouble, often at reduced or even zero interest.  However, thanks to the common and negative perception of credit card companies as predatory and harassing, many people refuse to listen to anything that is offered.  Maxed Out misses its opportunity to clue people in to these solutions, choosing instead to focus on the broader target of the Bad Ol' Credit Card Companies being mean to the Little Guy.

If you're in credit debt, you should definitely call your credit card company, tell them you are having difficulty and ask about any programs that can help you pay off your debt.  You'll be surprised at the solutions that are available.

And if you have no idea about how the whole credit industry works, Maxed Out is a good introduction, despite its idealogical and political slantings.  Use it as a starting point to do some research of your own.",1197504000,6,2916,4.6895874263261295

Along with that, if you don't ""Need it"", don't buy it, that's what the folks always said.  Wise use of credit cards is possible.

People want money. The credit card moguls prey on consumers who don't read the fine print before they sign their lives away; elected government officials including presidents ""borrow"" money from Social Security; and the average person wants an endless income. As my grandfather used to say, ""Rich or poor, it's good to have money.""

Maxed Out is an excellent documentary that, although somewhat disjointed, does do a very good job of exploring and explaining to people--in plain English--the risks of too much debt and the responsibilities they must face when it comes time to pay back that debt. We get fascinating interviews with unsuspecting, everyday people who unknowingly were fooled by creditors to become saddled with more debt than they could handle. We also see examples of families shattered when a member of the family actually kills themselves rather than face the shame of debt or bankruptcy. In addition, look for some excellent insights from Elizabeth Warren from Harvard University and former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

Maxed Out can be difficult to watch. After all, the stories we learn of are rather sad and unpleasant. We learn of credit card companies so driven to sign anyone up they give out credit cards like candy to college freshmen working a mere 12 hours a week. It's scary. We learn how four consecutive presidents ""borrowed"" money from social security just to pay interest on government loans and to keep the government open. (Actually, even this failed when the government closed for three days a few years ago.) Ay!

Worse yet, we are introduced to people at collection agencies who rather heartlessly leave messages with relatives and neighbors of the people in debt so that the debtors can be publicly embarrassed about getting a call from a collection agency. The shame is so great that according to Elizabeth Warren a bankruptcy is often referred to as ""the event"" because people can't bear to hear the word bankruptcy.

Of course, there is the other side of the coin. We see Dave Ramsey, a radio DJ who coaches individual responsibility when it comes to money management. I also had the sense, although the movie did not spell this out, that many parents simply assume that their eighteen year olds would never be given a credit card--and so too many parents never teach their kids about the risks of racking up debt. Parents and schools need to teach lessons about money management very, very carefully.

Overall, Maxed Out is an excellent film that deals with all of the above and more. The DVD also comes with interesting bonuses including another interview with Elizabeth Warren; a 1950's educational film about credit and money management that should still be shown to young students today; and we also get another close look at Dave Ramsey who counsels people on the radio about debt and getting out of it.

I highly recommend Maxed Out for anyone who wants to better understand just how predatory credit card companies can be--and just how much we still need to know about overall money management to avoid much more debt than we could ever repay. This movie also benefits from an excellent soundtrack. Although this subject matter could be dry, the movie keeps it all interesting by also showing interviews with everyday people about their financial problems and other film clips.",1194048000,38,3987,4.78343023255814
2799598,5,B000OU081M,"This is a great documentary on the practices of predatory lending. This has become a form of modern day slavery, whereby consumers are tricked and convinced to buy beyond their means with credit. This leads to impoverished people making minimum payments in order to cover the exorbitant interest rates. Interest rates that are claimed to be fair, because the credit companies say high rates discourage delinquency. It is this lateness that they profit from and count on however.

The primary focus of the film is to show the impact of this practice. It shows the huge industry that has developed out of lending such as collections, debt buyers, subprime mortgages, etc.

Some other reviewers have commented on its one-sidedness. This shows purpose is to focus on the predatory side of lending and its influence with people and the government, not on consumers responsibilities. My wife and I talked at length over this aspect of the documentary and came to the conclusion that it is not the style of documentary that presents both sides of an issue and then lets the viewer decide. This style is wholly one sided, but then again, how can you defend predatory lending that is presented in this show?

I would venture to say that this should be shown to all high school students as part of a consumer education class because there is an aspect of consumer responsibility that needs to be addressed and acted upon.",1191888000,,1411,4.846473029045643

It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right.",1191283200,6,1457,4.598455598455598

While predatory lending is certainly a problem in the US, laying the blame entirely at the feet of banks and politicians is unfair. As other reviewers have noted, there is NO mention of the borrower's responsibility to borrow responsibly and PAY BACK DEBT.

Prof. Warren from Harvard then tells us we're stuck using credit just to pay for 'the basics' of life, because everthing has gotten so much more expensive since the early '70's. Well, I'd like to point out that half the problem is that 'the basics' have swelled to ridiculous proportions over the past 35 years. Growing up, my family didn't have air conditioning, a microwave, computers, internet, cell phones, cable, VCR, DVD, a dishwasher, along with a host of small kitchen appliances that we now consider 'essentials.' Additionally, we RARELY ate out and had take out pizza maybe once every couple of months.

All of these items have BECOME basics, yet are completely not essential to life. Before we rack up debt, how about cutting out these things, which are really extras? I think the average family would be amazed at the possibilities...

Throughout life, everywhere we look, its buy this spend that! It becomes programed in our heads at an early age that we make MONEY for the purpose of spending it right away.

I do not feel that stronger regulation will fix the credit problem.  We live in America and should try to keep government out of any industry possible.

Lending executives reveal to Elizabeth Warren that interest and penalties paid by the poorest borrowers are the cash cow of the debt industry.  Debt collectors share their most humiliating techniques for extracting payment.  Overly-abundant debt ruins families and takes lives as pre-approval letters continue to pour in.  All the while, the profiteers are hiding behind the smokescreen of personal responsibility.  Maxed Out is certainly a one-sided film; precisely the side you WON'T get from the industry PR machine.

2799613,4,B000OU081M,"It's a well known fact that Americans are among the most consumer-oriented and debt-ridden people on the planet.  It's perhaps less well known that banks and credit card companies actually make their largest profits by extending mass amounts of credit to the very people who can least afford to be in debt.  By finally exposing this ironic truth to the light of day, the documentary ""Maxed Out"" aims to hold the powers-that-be accountable for their actions.

James D. Scurlock, the writer and director of the film, brings us one heartbreaking story after another about ordinary average citizens who have fallen victim to this consumer-credit nightmare.  Some are struggling working-class folk who were scammed by debt-consolidation lenders into believing that they would be paying lower interest rates and payments on their loans, only to discover that their new rates and payments were, in reality, astronomically higher.  Others are 18 year-old college students, who, it turns out, are prime targets for credit card companies who see these ""bad risks"" as gold stars in their corporate profit ledgers. Lending institutions also go after people who have previously filed for bankruptcy, knowing that such individuals are not only spending-prone by nature but legally unable to file for bankruptcy a second time.  Scurlock also interviews debt-collectors who seem all but indifferent to the plight of those they are going after, as well as more humanistic economists who understand completely the depth of the problem.

Perhaps the most damning criticism is leveled at politicians like George W. Bush and the members of Congress who passed the ironically named Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, making it much harder for the average American to escape his consumer debt burden and much easier for irresponsible creditors to hound their debtors sometimes literally to death, a point Scurlock brings home when he interviews people whose loved ones have committed suicide as a result of their financial and debt-related woes.  Yet, ironically, the film also shows the flippant attitude government officials seem to adopt regarding the nation's own debt situation as trillions of dollars of red ink spill unimpeded across the nation's treasury.

In terms of style, ""Maxed Out"" lacks the pizzazz and showmanship of a Michael Moore expose, but Scurlock`s single-minded passion still shines through loud and clear.  This is a fairly straightforward talking-heads documentary that cuts to the heart of the problem with compassion and precision.  The director does provide some much needed levity, though, by showing us snippets of a very funny standup comedy routine on the subject by Louis C. K., as well as excerpts from a typically cheesy 1960 instructional short entitled ""The Wise Use of Credit"" (the DVD contains the full ten-minute version of the film in the ""Extra Features"" section).

""Maxed Out"" is another in a long line of documentaries seemingly designed to make one feel insignificant and powerless in the face of hugely impersonal corporate forces.  Yet, if knowledge itself is power, then movies like ""Sicko,"" ""Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,"" ""Maxed Out"" etc. may, in their own small way, help lead to much-needed reform and change in the way the government and Big Business deal with the least of us in society.

It's disgusting people are so shallow & have so little self esteem they feel the need to have a house so big that they need an elevator & two sets of washers & dryers & are willing to go into debt just to try to make themselves feel superior to others.
You're family's share of the National Debt is 90,000
Bankruptcy bill was written by MBNA
Suze Orman has a deal with FICO's parent company
Credit reports are 50-90% inaccurate & have nothing to do with your income.
Collection agencies can call your neighbors or anyone to hassle, embarrass you.
There are no laws to protect your financial privacy.
People today compared to years ago actually have less money to pay for necessities.
Since Regan, the government has took billions from the Social Security & Pension to pay the national debt just to pay their interest payments.
Credit Card companies offered credit report kiosks to police stations so people can access them for anyone at any time... in return for ALL information police have on people.
An older wife/mother ran away & probably killed herself rather then let her family find out she had a secret gambling problem & hundreds of bills & that their house may be taken away.
Two young college students committed suicide when they felt their credit card debt was too high to climb out of & their parents still get credit card offers saying they want ""you back"".
The gov't spends more on interest payments on it's debt then on homeland security, education & health care combined.
People collect way too many expensive silly material things like plates instead of something constructive in life & willing to go into bankruptcy to do it.
Credit debt is on average $1 true principle debt & $2 in fees.
Comedian joked he only had $20 in his bank account & since so low, bank took $15 in fees.
Robin Leach says his old show ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous"" is just a fantasy for those who have little money. No one would watch ""Lifestyles of the poor & unknown""
Clinton's AmEx card was even rejected.

The idea of this film is great, but there should have been more info about how the credit fees & small print works & less time spent on emotional stories that you learn nothing from, especially ones about people who have a gambling debt or just buy way too much & collect silly things like over 500 collector plates. The emotional stories about people who live modestly & yet were persuaded to take out a loan by banks should have been expanded more with learning info of what NOT to do. The movie was a bit slow & boring for me. If they wanted to make this info more interesting & better for ADHD people, they should take advice from ""The Standard Deviants""

Bonus Material:
What is in your credit report:
Judges, congressmen, actors... anyone deemed ""important"" in public eye, people who can cause trouble for credit card companies politically, PR or financially, their credit reports are ""specially handled"" so that their credit reports are always 100% accurate, cleaned up & are not negatively impacted in any way unlike average person.
25-45% errors on credit report are enough to cause a credit denial. Credit & collection agencies will link reports that shouldn't be, will put spousal or relative's info that shouldn't be on there & even change the date of last activity so that though it's been 7 years & you are no longer responsible for that debt, changing that date extends it another 7 years.

2799616,2,B000OU081M,"At one point, this film uses old footage from a 50's documentary on credit in which the narrator lists ""character"" as an essential characteristic for the responsible credit holder.

One can only imagine that the film's creator is lampooning this idea as old fashioned, since nowhere in this production is there a hint that personal irresponsibility has played a role in the downfall of all the ""victims"" depicted herein.

Not that the predatory lending the film details hasn't transformed the financial landscape of middle class America in the last 40 years--it certainly has--to its immense detriment. And the sham piety of credit card company reps testifying before Congress is more than a little sickening.

Certainly one can shake one's head at the misfortune associated with college student's being given credit, for which they are neither psychologically nor fiscally prepared.

But what are we to make of a middle aged woman, living in a large exurban subdivision home, who elected to pay her mortgage payments with credit upon the death of her husband? Nowhere is the question posed, (nor evidently entertained at the time) as to whether it was time to downsize into a domicile consonant with her income. Maybe she had ample reasons for doing what she did, fully justifiable reasons, but these we never learn...

This genuinely heart rending example, and a tragedy involving another woman--this time, a suicide resulting from a gambling addiction, inevitably recall the ""character"" issues raised in this movie's spoofy use of the old 50's film clip.

Then there's the lady professor from Harvard who assures us throughout that the country has been forced to embrace credit card debt in order to survive--prices being what they are today. (This attestation coming moments after witnessing the construction of a Las Vegas home with two (count em) washing machines and dryers is vaguely disconcerting.) Not that inflation is the only culprit. Oh no, for this we need to wait for the closing reels, in order to view the villain, (or villains) behind the curtain.

And then, of course, we find out who the real crooks are, (besides the credit card companies). You guessed it! President Bush, (both of them), and the late President Ronald Reagan. And Michael Moore isn't even listed in the credits ! (Predictably, ""Katrina"" is also shoehorned into the narrative for good measure.) One wonders why the film's blame doesn't extend to LBJ since Bank AmericaCard was introduced during his Administration.

If we are honest, we can certainly emphasize and recognize our collective weaknesses and tendencies to greed in each and all of the people the film depicts. And no small number of us probably shake our heads and say, ""There but for the grace of God go I.""

Most people think debt and credit cards are not dangerous if you are responsible with them.  What they don't realize is that they are traps that are designed to catch even the most responsible of borrowers in a growing spiral until they lose the battle.  Even people who pay off their credit card balances each month should pay attention.  The contracts on these agreements amount to slavery covenants.

RESPONSIBLE

Main Entry: responsible

Pronunciation: ri-'spn(t)-s&-b&l

1 a : liable to be called on to answer b (1) : liable to be called to account as the primary cause, motive, or agent <a committee responsible for the job> (2) : being the cause or explanation <mechanical defects were responsible for the accident> c : liable to legal review or in case of fault to penalties

2 a : able to answer for one's conduct and obligations : TRUSTWORTHY b : able to choose for oneself between right and wrong

3 : marked by or involving responsibility or accountability <responsible financial policies> <a responsible job>

Man, it's just so easy to blame everything on someone else  these days, e.g fast food for being fat, big tobacco for cancer, blaming banks for uncontrolled spending.  Jeeez.

If you prefer to gain your information via some other form than books, this is a good alternative. I happen to own both movie and book and think they complement each other, belong together as a set.
  After watching this, I doubt you'll feel the same about credit and debt again. It will help you avoid predatory offers and, more importantly, be wary. NEVER forget that credit card companies are in business to make money, preferably by helping you wrack up debt at the highest interest rates possible. Miss a payment? They'll be counting the extra dollars as they up your interest rate. DON""T miss a payment and you may find your interest rate ""arbitrarily"" raised anyway.
  If you believe in increasing your financial literacy, this is a must-see. Credit cards can be tamed and, when used wisely and with back-up funds to keep you from being at the mercy of credit card companies, they can be a valuable tool in your financial picture. But be wary...and wise about the pros and cons.

2799623,5,B000OU081M,"As a 30-something accountant who was marketed to heavily by credit card companies once I turned 18, I could completely relate to this film.  By age 21 I had my car repossessed, defaulted on 2 loans, 8 credit cards, and was unable to open even a savings account in my name.  All the credit was given to me, like many of the people featured in the film, while I was earning minimum wage at a part-time job.

Today I try and counsel my clients away from debt of all kinds, including the ever-present tax refund loans, check cashing, and home equity lines.

The sad truth is that many people need these services to simply stay afloat from month to month, and the movie didn't offer any more solutions than I generally can.  Still, I highly recommend this film to everyone, and especially enjoyed the little jab made at Suze Orman.

It ought to be compulsory viewing before your kid leaves for college and signs a few credit card applications in the quad in exchange for a frisbee -- and a future of credit card hell. One mother explained in tears that her kid had no job and 12 cards, each one maxed out with $1,000 of debt. Her friend recalls how she and her husband both worked thirty years ago but were denied cards. Adjustable rate mortgages, minimum monthly payments, zero down loans, no payments for a year, and interest free transfers help explain why the average American has $9,205 of credit card debt and will fork over $1300 a year on interest alone. The national debt is about $9 trillion and increasing by more than a billion dollars per day. Your family's share is about $100,000. To make its own minimum monthly payments the government has raided Social Security reserves, until those too vanished in 2005. Maxed Out interviews all the actors in this fiscal nightmare: Congressional inquiries, gurus like Suze Orman and Dave Ramsey, common debtors, ruthless collectors, pawn shop brokers, and corporate executives who keep a straight face when they explain why the incredibly profitable and easy money they offer us is such a good thing.",1181779200,13,1261,4.7889908256880735
2799625,5,B000OU081M,"President Bush is shown  in the film before he signs the new bankruptcy bill into law saying these words:
This has made credit less affordable and less accessible, especially for low-income workers who already face financial obstacles.
 Mr. Bush, Do you really believe your own lies? Easy credit is available and the lenders are overjoyed to  give credit to those who they know are going to have a difficult time!
The truth is NOBODY WHO IS UNABLE TO PAY THE BALANCE OF A CREDIT CARD EVERY MONTH SHOULD EVEN HAVE A CREDIT CARD!!!
Elizabeth Warren, You were terrific in this documentary! Keep fighting for what is right! I admire you!
Ramsey, I applaud your stance about CC's but tell us more about your own bankruptcy and stop giving such flip answers on your radio show about people repaying when you have so little info. Sometimes filing bankruptcy IS the best solution when someone is snowed in with loan shark interest and ""penalty"" fees, as the goliaths of greed like to call their gouging!
Maybe since you are making money from those who file bankruptcy now though, your position has softened.
To the debt buyers:
It should be against  the law to add interest to debt you have paid pennies on the dollar for. Shame, shame, shame on you for piling on more debt.  And sometimes not even telling those you abuse that you are charging interest when they innocently agree to send you monthly payments, believing they are reducing a debt!
Anyone facing a collection agency, needs to ask ALOT of questions and better yet, tell these crooks that you don't deal with third party collectors! Debt buying has become such a huge business and even gone public, so you can be sure there will be more abuses since these agencies  people need to ""keep the shareholders happy"" .

Interest is SUPPOSED to be charged by the co that a person borrowed the money from. It is mind boggling that a debt buyer can buy a debt that has been charged off and add their own interest, thereby putting a person into a spiral of debt they can only  legally escape from through death or bankruptcy!  If interest is charged at all, it should ONLY be allowed for the pennies you bought the debt for.
To make  comments that you are collecting a debt someone owes is not the whole story and YOU know it.

Bud Hibbs, Thank God for you exposing so many of these agencies that have
ripped off so many  and hurt and abused so many.

While its emphasis on victims is compelling, in my opinion this made it inferior to PBS FRONTLINE's ""Secret History of the Credit Card.""

The latter is far more insightful and can be viewed free online at PBS site. Go to PBS-dot-org -- click Programs, then Frontline, then ""Secret History"".

But ""Secret History"" doesn't cover the rising level of national debt, so I highly recommend both.  Buy ""Maxed Out,"" watch ""Secret History"" and then maybe buy that too.

They had some interesting interviews, especially one where debt collectors brag about their manipulative strategies.

But there were several problems I had it. First off, there's no narrator. They tried to cut together the interviews in a way that made sense, but the flow suffered from it. They did put in title screen that did help to tie them together, but were plain white text over black backgrounds. Even the titles of the interviewees were  done this way; ever heard of lower thirds? Plus some of the people they interviewed were borderline whispering. They knew what they were talking about, but were not pleasing to listen to.

At one point they cut between an interview of the debt collectors and a couple talking about how their loved one committed suicide after non-stop calls. Even though I agree that debt collectors can go overboard, this is very manipulative put these stories together. We feel like that these laughing debt collectors are the cause of the suicide, but we have no idea what else may have been going on in the life of the victim. Not to mention those collectors never would have agreed to the interview if that had really known what it was going to be used for.

The documentary could have been a lot better if they had a better plan for post-production. The content was there, just not put together well.",1496448000,,1499,4.709923664122138
