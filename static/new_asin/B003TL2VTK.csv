4190528,5,B003TL2VTK,"This video is split in to two DVDs, the box itself does not have the overall time listed so one would easily think that 2-DVDs should equal lots of time. As in there is just to much info here for one dvd so we had to use two, but that is not really the case. What was done was split the information into two major sections (one per DVD), ""informational"" or ""classroom"" section and the range section each section is about 45 minutes long, so about hour and a half-ish over all. This could have been easily combined onto just one DVD.

The overall production values where fine.

The first section, ""classroom"", has Mr. Smith sitting in a chair discussing various topics. They called it a ""Mental Preparation Lecture"". Has some good information and is well worth the time to listen. He talked about distance, time(speed), targets, training along others. One thing i found to be interesting is through out his whole video if he mentions or says what firearm the ""bad guy"" is using its always the AK, because only bad guys shoot that rifle (sarcasm).

The second half is the range portion, pretty basic to moderate skills/drills are shown with some good tips and tricks here and there. He incorporated some movement in his drills and shooting though they where still all the ""stand and deliver"" mentality. But any movement is better than no movement. Also showed some transition and off handed drills and even some drills from the ground. Should a pretty good amount of malfunction clearing demonstrations.

Through out the videos Mr. Smith has a very no-nonsense way of instructing which i always prefer, they even ""warn you"" with a pop up about his ""Clintisims"" before hand.

Overall i would recommend this video to anyone who has some basic hand gunning skills who are looking for the next step or even to anyone more experienced who would like a nice refresher.",1356393600,,1860,4.71076923076923
4190529,5,B003TL2VTK,"I originaly gave this a bad review due poor audio guality, it turned out to be the equipment i was using ... so in all fairness i wanted to edit this review to: GOOD STUFF!  It is always good to review what you think you know.'",1341705600,,227,3.9347826086956523
4190530,5,B003TL2VTK,There are many ways to skin a cat and this video tells you how to do it precisely and without any fluff.  You will need to watch it over and over and there is nothing but detail in good gun handling.,1340150400,3,199,3.8536585365853657
4190531,5,B003TL2VTK,Clint Smith does an excellent job with his instruction and commentary is insightful and humorous as well...definitely worth the price of admission!,1310083200,,147,5.7272727272727275

8405182,3,B003TL2VTK,"I enjoyed it. Most of the information is common sense. I did find some of it to be interesting. They addressed trigger control, as it pertains to the  trigger reset on semi-autos. Probably could get similar information by watching YouTube videos. Quite a lot to be found there.",1474243200,,277,4.770833333333333
8405183,5,B003TL2VTK,Good training film.,1469318400,,19,5.666666666666667
8405184,5,B003TL2VTK,"Best DVD for beginners and a good one for more advanced shooters to remind them of the basics.  Master the basics and forget about the so called ""advanced gun handling""  TTP.  Few have the time or money to learn into muscle memory a twelfth way to reload just in case they are sitting on a 3 legged stool with one broken leg at night in a porta potty and uncertain if the bad guys are still alive or around.  Master the basics..",1458086400,,428,4.182926829268292
8405185,5,B003TL2VTK,I highly recommend this video for anyone who wants learn to shoot or wants to improve their shooting. I show the safety section it to everyone who goes to the range with me.,1449360000,2,173,4.2727272727272725
