2449939,5,B000BZ8MYA,"As a big fan of home fitness routines, I have tried quite a few.  I have really felt the burn with others, but they had been so taxing on my system that I'd have to stop before I reached my target heart rate...  With this workout, I am able to push myself into that target range without feeling like I'm overdoing it.  Very glad to have it among my collection :)",1141344000,2,362,4.070422535211268
2449940,5,B000BZ8MYA,"I loved this workout when it was on VHS. Since that I have tried many other step workouts, but still Gin Miller's routine is my favorite. It was really powerful, without extra dancemoves, just what I needed for a good sweating workout. Besides, I do like Gin Miller and her style. I am glad to find out it is avaiable on DVD now!",1141171200,6,329,4.238095238095238
2449941,5,B000BZ8MYA,"Want to feel great about yourself, just do this video or dvd once and you will feel like a million bucks! It is intense, but the cool downs in between make it possible to do.  I am 42 years old and I can do it after doing the FIRM workouts for 4 years, so you can do it too.  Great all over workout, good change up from other workouts, Gin, you are amazing!!",1140480000,3,358,3.8904109589041096
2449942,5,B000BZ8MYA,"I have been waiting years for the reebok step videos to be released on DVD.  Gin Miller is a superb instructor, her step workouts are solid and well planned.  This particular workout is suitable for the beginner to the super fit, as in each circuit you can choose which move you want to do, and for how much of the minute you want to do it for, then go for a 15 second to 1 minute blast, after which you go to a resting pattern on the step whilst Gin explains what the next move is going to be.  You can choose to do low impact, intermediate or high impact moves and as your fitness level improves perform harder moves for more or all of the minute.  I find this workout particularly good as I don't like very complex moves, I can't normally do dance videos without a lot of practice as I get a bit lost.  You can plunge straight in to this workout and know exactly what you're doing.",1136592000,7,884,4.146198830409356
2449953,5,B000BZ8MYA,Had it in VHS and finally found it available on DVD ---one of my favorites and still do step along with other workouts!,1475193600,,119,4.217391304347826
2449954,5,B000BZ8MYA,"Awesome work outs. I'm 49 years old, still doing Gin Millers step routines to keep in shape and maintain my weight.  Her work step work outs are the best for any age group and you can modifiy, if you want it to be less intense. Me, i love the intensity!!",1464652800,,254,4.08

2449957,5,B000BZ8MYA,Awesome workout but still brings the pain!,1439596800,,42,5.142857142857143
2449958,4,B000BZ8MYA,"This work out is great because you can work out at the more intense level or a lower level if you're starting out. I really like it because it's different. However, it is a lower body work out for the most part. And I'm not saying that's bad at all. I just want people to know that there is no upper body workout. It is definitely intense cardio....but you don't do anything with your arms or anything. No strengthening for the arms. But I really like it a lot for cardio.",1425340800,3,472,4.197802197802198
2449959,5,B000BZ8MYA,"laughing ans sweating is this workout, you laugh cause your like really you want me to do what / then you do it and your sweating and it is great.

this is wonderful",1400803200,,165,4.0
2449960,5,B000BZ8MYA,"This is an incredible workout. It has everything: Gin's cueing, ability to choose your own level, visuals to tell you how far into the interval you are. Absolutely fabulous. A hint: record your recovery heart rates. That is, immediately at the end of one interval and immediately before the beginning of the next one. Over time you will see your heart rate coming down faster, an indicator of training effect.

This is a little off-topic, but these people who are charging 66, 67 dollars for this video: Are you insane? I cannot fathom why you would charge almost 3 times the cost of this video and expect to actually sell it.",1400025600,2,626,4.63963963963964
2449961,5,B000BZ8MYA,I would recommend this DVD anyone looking for an intense workout.  Even if new to step...easy to follow and a great workout!,1393200000,,124,4.636363636363637
2449962,5,B000BZ8MYA,One of my favorites. You better be in shape because this one doesn't play.  Get in shape fast with Gin.,1391558400,,103,4.15
2449963,5,B000BZ8MYA,"I'm an aerobics instructor and personal trainer but not so much since kids. Need a good workout and usually can't find that in videos however this one is the exception! I hate combining resistance with cardio because due to my goals, I have a separate rigid lifting routine. This video is an excellent cardio workout!  Intervals are all cardio",1387756800,2,343,4.813559322033898
2449964,5,B000BZ8MYA,"I recently purchased this DVD and am so pleased with it. It isn't a ""step"" workout like other step workouts, ie no complicated choreography to learn and no dancing around. Rather, it's a cardio workout that incorporates the step and I absolutely love it. It's a really a hard-pumping tough workout especially if you choose the more advanced options. You can tailor the workout to your needs - keep it low impact when you feel like it or power it up when you're ready to challenge yourself. I was seriously sweating halfway through and it felt great.

I obtained a copy of Gin Miller's original The Step workout and didn't enjoy it at all. It got some great reviews but I found the workout not challenging in the least. The set was distracting and most of the moves weren't to the beat of the music so it was a bit confusing. I'm really glad I didn't give up on Gin Miller cause she redeems herself in Intense Moves. It's a definitely keeper (it's from 1997 and still going strong!) and better than many of the newer workouts I've tried.",1299283200,,1036,4.481481481481482
2449965,5,B000BZ8MYA,"This is an pretty advanced interval training workout where, after the warm-up, you go into series of 1 minute intervals followed by 2 minute rest periods for approximately 30 minutes.  The workout is really well structured, while you are on your rest period Gin demonstrates what you will be doing next, giving you three options - the `base move', a harder version and the hardest version.  The whole workout is around 50 minutes, although I find the time flies, it certainly doesn't get boring when you're continually doing something new every few minutes.  As with most interval training workouts, this is not a low impact workout, especially if you are following the harder options.  That said, this workout is excellent for tailoring to your fitness level as you do have three options for every interval.

Pretty much any Gin Miller workout is worth having, her uncomplicated style, excellent cuing and pointers make her, in my opinion, one of the best instructors out there but this is one of my favourites, not only of hers, but of all my workout DVD's.",1277596800,2,1059,4.861111111111111
2449966,5,B000BZ8MYA,"I have been using Gin Miller's Step Reebok: Intense Moves for a few years now.  I was glad to see that I was able to purchase this item on DVD online, since I wore out my old VHS tape.  This workout is a fun and intense workout.  This workout has different intervals that go from beginner to advanced, so you can work yourself up at your own pace. This workout is not only aerobic, but works out all different parts of your body. I have lost inches on my thighs which is my troubled spot. I highly recommend Gin Miller's Step Reebok: Intense Moves.",1254268800,,548,4.25
2449967,5,B000BZ8MYA,"I have been using this tape in my workout rotation since it first came out and it is an excellent cardio workout. No time wasted learning complicated moves, which I hate.  The steps are basic, but challenging athletic moves that really make me work up a sweat and raise my heart rate (No rest for the weary). All you need is a step, and you can adjust the level and intensity of the workout by removing or adding risers. I also use old Firm Classic videos, but this is a good alternative to Firm workouts which rely on weights to raise the heart rate. I highly recommend this workout if your looking for a great solid aerobic/cardio workout!",1252800000,,641,4.432203389830509
2449968,5,B000BZ8MYA,"As a dedicated stepper with a high level of fitness I was looking for a challenge, and found it with this routine. Even if you are on a 10 inch step doing all the hardest interval exercises, there is always room to push it a little bit harder. My favorite step DVD from a brilliant instructor.",1245888000,,293,4.25
2449969,5,B000BZ8MYA,"Trying to find a workout dvd that you like is like looking for a needle in a haystack! After dozens of failures that now clutter my shelves and much money lost, I lucked into finding this one! FINALLY!

This is a FANTASTIC dvd. I love everything about it.

The music is great which is unusual for exercise videos, keeps you pumped and has a great beat.

Gin Miller is incredible, her instructions perfectly timed and easy to follow even in this fast paced routine. She is motivating and energetic and leads you expertly thru the more advanced moves.

She shows you 3 different levels at which you can exercise so you can decide how high impact/intense you want to make it.

More for advanced to intermediate exercisers, this workout will challenge even the most experienced steppers. It incorporates the latest moves and gets you sweating! Interval training at its finest! Fun! fun! fun!",1190851200,10,887,4.771241830065359
2449970,5,B000BZ8MYA,"A friend purchased this in VHS format (yeah old skool) for me 10 years ago. I bought the DVD version a few years ago, and I somehow lost it (I think I accidentally sent it with my Blockbuster videos via snail mail), and I just purchased it AGAIN! That is how fabulous this video is. I'm in excellent condition, I've trained in martial arts (muay thai), long distance sports (triathlon) and I'm a huge Crossfit fan, and this video can STILL get me out of breath. Highly recommended to kick your workout up a notch.",1190505600,5,513,4.410526315789474
2449971,4,B000BZ8MYA,This is a great workout video!  You can adjust your workout level based on your ability and it does not have complicated moves to learn.  Some of the other workout videos make you feel like you're auditioning to be in a Janet Jackson video!  Gin is also very good with her explanations and encouragement throughout the video!  I always feel like I get a great workout after this video.,1186790400,2,385,4.536231884057971
2449972,5,B000BZ8MYA,"This is my favorite Gin Miller STEP workout.  If you love high intensity/impact workouts this is for you.  It will definitely get your heart rate way up!  Gin is really motivating in this video.  Make sure you won't bother your neighbors below, because there's a lot of jumping on and off the bench.",1173484800,3,299,4.584905660377358
8094658,5,B000BZ8MYA,Love Gin Miller videos and this is no exception. I can easily adjust the workout depending on how I'm feeling that day. I own a number of her step videos - I wish she had more coming!,1524009600,,183,3.972972972972973

8094663,5,B000BZ8MYA,"I love this DVD by Gin Miller!  It's a great workout!  She shows how you can take some of the basic steps and make it 1 or 2 levels harder, if you'd like.  I've done her workout 6 times now and each time I am sweating lots, as much as I sweated after an intense spinning class - this is not for beginners!  I actually enjoy this better than a spinning class as it's more varied (less boring)!  I find that time passes quicker, LOL.  I love that I'm moving my whole body, not just mostly my legs when I'm spinning.  I hadn't done step-aerobics for over 20 years and it took a couple workout sessions to get back into the groove but I'm glad I decided to give it a try again.  Over the past several years I've done more spinning and yoga classes but I currently am finding it hard to get to a gym so now I'm working out at home, on my schedule.  This is a great solution for me to get and stay in shape!",1487030400,3,901,3.9611111111111112
