8272551,4,6303026168,"Ren & Stimpy have came a very long way since they started the turn from zany cartoon characters, to video vixens in animation. Nevertheless, the manx cat and the dog still have a couple of surprises for everybody. They can always know how to put on their best costumes an make themselves into the most sneaky ways possible. All in the names for some good homes and food. It was shown several times within these cartoons that Ren & Stimpy have appealed to.
There are three cartoons to this crowd. The first, Fire Dogs, showcases the duo dressing themselves up like dalmations, so they can recieve good pay from the fire department, where they have to work hard, especially when the fire comes around, from a big building with goofy characters.
The second cartoon, Monkey See... Monkey Don't, the idea is that the two try to enter a zoo, so they can get some grub, posing as a couple of monkeys. In this cartoon, they meet up with another monkey named Filthy, who tries to make a monkey out of them in tricks, and within their chances at getting some decent food. Nevertheless, monkeying isn't all what it is cracked up to be.
The final cartoon, The Boy Who Cried Rat, is another similar example to Ren & Stimpy getting good service. In the cartoon, Ren poses as a rat, as a similar parody to the old Tom & Jerry cartoons, with a little bit of Mickey Mouse in the way Ren dresses. Unfortunately, there is a unbelieveable twist, where Stimpy is forced to eat Ren up and chew him all the way down. Thankfully, Stimpy coughed him up, otherwise there wouldn't be anymore episodes.
There is also a bonus short called Ren's Pecs. Just a music video short based on Ren finally making it in life, after getting chest implants, through the eyes of his friend Stimpy.
It is just a shame that Ren & Stimpy are no longer being aired on television anymore. It would really be exciting to see the two of them come back to light in full circle. Oh Joy, what an exciting experience that would be.",1049241600,3,1978,4.466850828729282
