8764014,5,B01GWCBR24,I'm hesitant to order movies online because sometimes they don't have good quality. I was happy to see (and hear) this one works just fine!,1517702400,,139,4.6
8764015,5,B01GWCBR24,"What more can you ask for? Lots more and this movie have it. As a rule, I steer clear of prison movies but this movie transcends the prison genera. They depict the prison as a working environment where the guards calmly control the prisoners through quiet resolve instead of cattle prods.

It maintains King's ""more than life"" world with out the ""you'll-be-et"" monsters. Michael Clarke Duncan made a great John 'Johnny' Coffey and some credit needs to go to the mouse that was a much better actor then the one in ""Mouse Hunt"". Even thought we know that the guards do not really wear uniforms. They were an added plus in the movie; you knew when the hat was on that they meant business.",1502150400,2,685,4.524193548387097
