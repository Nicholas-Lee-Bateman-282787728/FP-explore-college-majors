8311295,5,B001IQDARA,"I bought this item, with ""September Dawn"" which is a hollywoodified version of what really happened on that tragic day
Unfortunately the actual events that occurred which are portrayed in this item do not jibe with the Hollywood over dramatized version.
This version is much more historically accurate.",1472860800,,302,5.3125

8311297,5,B001IQDARA,Good DVD.  Anybody who says it is bad or that it is anti-mormon is just ridiculous.  It's pretty fair and balanced.,1448755200,,115,4.428571428571429
8311298,1,B001IQDARA,"I was delighted to receive the movie, but greatly saddened by the presentation of the Mormon plight. It seems that in every conflict, the Mormons were described in a way that makes them appear as criminal people, when actually, their zealous nature to seek goodness and be productive in all things offended the slothful people around them who were content to do little with the land and generally disregarded good manners, good work habits, et cetera. And, although the Mountain Meadows Massacre is a black spot on the history of the Mormons, the movie plays down the historical aspect of the provocation by the filthy, criminal element that accompanied the wagon train. Those vile individals ridiculed and insulted the Mormons at every opportunity, and when they promised to return from California to kill all of the Mormons, their fate was pretty much sealed because of all that the Mormons had suffered before. Another insult in the movie,  was the lackluster, weak narrators who portrayed some of the great Mormon men.  This is an instance wherein History. Com has failed its viewers in presenting a decidedly anti-Mormon documentary, for whatever reason.  The brutality of the Mormon tormentors and the lack of Constitutional protection from anybody is a black mark on all of those involved at the time.",1433721600,5,1308,5.046296296296297
