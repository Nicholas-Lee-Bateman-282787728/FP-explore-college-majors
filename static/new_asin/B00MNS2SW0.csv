8673319,5,B00MNS2SW0,"Great entertainment for any age.  Delightful talents put these movies together:  stories, scripts, animation, music and voice actors are all first-rate.  The singing and dancing of the birds, particularly the macaws, is spectacular.  The human beings are secondary in interest, with the good ones being insipid and the bad ones being environmental rapists.

Our only caveat is that our four-year-old got upset at the bird capture in the first movie, but he loves to watch the second over and over again for the color, music, and evergy.",1498003200,,536,5.114942528735632
