As several others have mentioned, the scenery from Bora Bora and the underwater sequences are almost worth the price alone.  The plot is somewhat weak and predictable and the ending certainly leaves a lot of questions hanging; the quality of the acting is workmanlike at best.  In short, don't expect Oscar performances here, but DO expect some great views!",1363564800,2,572,4.9375

  I have always liked Dayton Ka'ne in the movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hurricane/dp/B0019UGYA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hurricane</a>&nbsp;(1979), however he does have one more movie to his credit. Beyond the Reef, aka, Shark Boy of Bora Bora. Completed in 1979, but released in 1981.
  Based upon the novel, Tikoyo and His Shark.
Tikoyo (Joseph Ka'ne) and Diana (Titaua Castel) are childhood friends on Bora Bora.  They enjoy underwater exploring and dancing together. Tikoyo is taken care of by his grandfather. Diana was told by her relative that she must go to the states to be with her father and for schooling. She vows to return someday.
Tikoyo missed Diana.

Tikoyo (Dayton Ka'ne) ,now a man, lives in a hut with no need for money. He has taken care of the shark his grandfather had given to him.
  Diana (Maren Jensen) returns to Bora Bora.  Tikoyo sees her at the dance.

Also in the cast: Kathleen Swan, Maui Temaui, Keahi Farden.

Lots of underwater footage, however if you have seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;(1975) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-2/dp/B00005A8XX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws 2</a>&nbsp;(1978), the shark footage might be disturbing.

  If you like Dayton Ka'ne, you will get through this romantic storytelling.

Filmed on location in Bora Bora, Tahiti, French Polynesia, just as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hurricane/dp/B0019UGYA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hurricane</a>&nbsp;(1979) was, both starring Dayton Ka'ne.

  DVD released by Castle Home Video.

Too bad Dayton Ka'ne did not continue acting. Hurricane (1979) and Beyond the Reef, Sharkboy of Bora Bora are his only two movies.",1294185600,5,1996,6.943775100401607
7947882,4,B00005NW4K,"I saw this film in the theater when I was a kid (I think I was either 9 or 10). The acting in this film is very bad and the story is a bit hokey, but I give it 4 stars for three reasons:

One, the scenery in this film is gorgeous. The alternate title for the film is ""Shark Boy of Bora Bora"". I'm not sure if the movie was actually filmed there, but it could just as well have been filmed somewhere in the Bahamas or Hawaii. Regardless, the tropical setting makes for an astounding backdrop. The cinematography in this film was well-done and seemed to capture the escence of the tropics. The underwater sequences are also very well done.

Two, the muscial score by the legendary Francis Lai is just as beautiful and breathtaking as the tropical scenery. The score is partly electronic and partly acoustic piano with just a smattering of orhchestration, but the results are pure brilliance. I have been searching for this soundtrack for many, many years. Either it is ultra-rare or non-existant. If anyone has any info on it, PLEASE drop me a line!

Three, is the fact that Maren Jensen (of the original Battlestar Galactica fame) is in it! She's been somewhat of a recluse since the early 80s, but back in the late 70s, she was downright gorgeous. Seeing her semi-nude in a tropical setting was worth the price of admission alone (I'm speaking through the eyes of a 30-something male, back when I first saw the film, I was too young to appreciate that part of it)!

One disappointment, though, is the fact that the DVD is pan & scan. With beautiful scenery such as this, the movie should definitely have been released in anamorphic widescreen. Also, PLEASE BE WARNED: the only copies available seem to be in PAL format, so if you do not have a computer with a DVD-ROM or a DVD player that accepts the PAL format, you won't be able to watch the movie!

This film holds a lot of nostalgia for me, but many others may not be able to get past the bad acting and cheesy dialogue. Regardless, this film is worth a look. Natural beauty abounds!",1184544000,17,2037,4.450402144772118
