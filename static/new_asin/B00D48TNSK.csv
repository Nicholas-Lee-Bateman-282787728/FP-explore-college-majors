8589415,2,B00D48TNSK,"Painful overdose of cute with Peter Facinelli doing double duty as screenwriter and star as a goodhearted pick-pocket forced to work for a grungy Fagin figure to pay off his dead pop's half a million dollars in gambling debts.  He runs afoul of a Police Lieutenant played by Michael Madsen for stealing his badge and using it for laughs so the whole thing will end up in the papers and make him public enemy number one for at least one member of the police force--not really the best idea if you are a pick-pocket trying to live outside the sight of the law.

Things take a turn towards so sugary you might end up in a dietary coma when Bobby finds out a one night stand from three-months ago that he secretly fell in love with at first sight is pregnant with his baby.  The possibility of her having or not having an abortion probably couldn't be handled more awkwardly or with less good taste--the rest of the movie vacillates awkwardly between being a way too cute for its own good romantic comedy and an unconvincing crime film.

I suppose this is aimed at women who might find Peter Facinelli (Dr. Cullen from the Twilight films) dreamy and it's even possible that the target audience for this thing might actually enjoy it.  I found it pretty unbearable, yet I sat through it to the end even though I can't say why--Run or Die is a chick flick all the way.  If Peter Facinelli doesn't do it for you consider yourself good and warned.",1430870400,,1439,4.452471482889734
