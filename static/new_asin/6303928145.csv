7874970,1,6303928145,"I bought the film becuse I thought it was a comedy, I am familiar with Scott Thompsons work on the TV show ""The Kids In the Hall"". The movie stinks. Poor acting, It appears more ad-lib than scripted and basically has no redeeming values. Unfortunately neither ...(the website) nor the Internet Movie Data Base contain any information on the movies EXPLICIT content. The movie would be rated X (possibily triple X to attract the intended audience) if it was rated. do yourself a favor and save your money, pass on this. the worst film I ever attempted to view, and to be fair, I couldn't watch it after the first twenty or so minutes, it is that bad",982022400,8,648,4.5
