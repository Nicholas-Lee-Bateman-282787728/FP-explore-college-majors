Before I explain about the series, I guess I should delve into what Episode 12.5 is. Basically episode 12.5 is a recap episode which tells the story of the events leading up to Episode 13, this is told through the eyes of Keita, basically Keita is speaking about events that have occured and in some cases what he is feeling. It's not a bad recap episode actually, in my eyes its watchable and the Keita stuff is worth it.

One thing I absolutely love about this volume is that it's purely self contained, it contains the kind of episodes you'd expect when watching any normal animes finale, only this time the creators have decided to tie up all unresolved plot points and leftovers which kicks off the final storyline of this series when you see the cliffhanger for the last episode on the disc.

Now Episode 13 onwards.

6 Months have past since the end of the Episode 12, the world is a different place. This volume begins with Kuro walking in a robe along a snow filled highway only to be confronted by several men in suits who pull up from their cars to confront her. After dispatching the men Kuro heads towards a house/mansion containing the noble ones/several friendly tera guardians and of course Keita comatose in bed.

If there's one thing this volume has in huge amounts it's fights. Everyone you know and love has a battle to fight, lots of new Exceeds are shown such as Yakumos, and Burnhearts, as well as the bad guys ones(naturally).

Keitas former friend Daichi Kuraki has changed the world. He's trying to make his ideal utopia filled with Master Roots, by doing this he's killing subs and no one really seems to care. Japan is thriving, everyone in power seems happy. Only difference being people are rising up against him, the noble ones are split, tera guardians conflicted.

By doing this, the story reaches its climax, the good guys are bringing the fight to him. Kuro/Keita are trying to save Akane, and at the same time put a stop to Daichi Kurakis twisted vision of a new world.

I loved this volume, it brings the meaning of fighting against fate straight to your heart. It makes you care about the characters. Lots of battles happen all at the same time.

My only complaint I would say is that the creators put Keita down as a Sub, yet in one episode Kuro used 7 exceeds against the bad guys one after another and Keita seemed perfectly fine. Prior to this she could barely do 3 without Keita feeling weak. Seems like they forgot Keitas strength.

With that being said this Volume contains one major important death. Some touchy feeling moments and some really fun battles and dialogue.

I would call this the best Volume thus far.

I only wish more people watched Kurokami, it's really good.",1289692800,,2858,4.602362204724409
