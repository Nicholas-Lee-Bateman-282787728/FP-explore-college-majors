1803566,4,B00007AJE8,"This film is surprisingly tender, and undeniably charming.  The tension only works effectively because of the ""supposed"" repulsion and repugnancy that Cusack feels toward Sellers.
 The two play remarkably well together, sharing
almost all the scenes together.  There is a light,
warm hearted chemistry here, which can only be
found in films from this period.
 The ending is where the greatness of what came before is heightened.  This film actually has some deep commentary and metaphorical significance concerning the roles of men and women, in relationships today.
 I can only say, that, what Hoffman says is true, in his first dramatic monologue in the film.
  ""These men, with their thoughts,
  full of breasts and bottoms and thighs.
  Their revolution is almost upon you:
  just you wait, just you wait.  Hope never  dies in a man with a good dirty mind.""
You have to love Peter Sellers.",1048896000,10,893,5.013698630136986

1803571,5,B00007AJE8,"This is a fabulous movie.  I first saw it years ago on TV -- I don't know that it was ever theatrically released in the USA.  But even with the commercials, it proved to be a touching, true experience.  For any man who feels he's been overlooked for not being handsome or successful enough, this movie is a touchstone of encouragement.  Peter Sellers like you've never seen him before, plays this one with total mastery.
One word of caution:  This is a British movie from 1969, which means it focuses on its intelligence and depth.  If you're looking for quick cuts and adventure, this is not the movie for you.  But if you're seeking a thoughtful, relevant piece on a timeless issue, I can't recommend it any more highly.",1328313600,2,722,4.550387596899225
1803572,3,B00007AJE8,"Barely released, ""Hoffman"" (1970) contains one of Peter Sellers' finest dramatic portrayals in a refreshingly offbeat two-character study. Sinad Cusack delivers an equally impressive performance in her first starring role. The British production is overlong due to director Alvin Rakoff's leisurely pacing, but the actors hold your interest. Another hidden gem from Sellers' so-called ""lost decade.""",1308700800,3,399,6.142857142857143
1803573,5,B00007AJE8,"I really loved this film when I rented it in New Hampshire about 10 years ago.  At first I was somewhat taken aback by the plot.  Then the light went on and I realized, it's a 60's retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast""! - and rather well done, too.

It wasn't possible to purchase a copy back when I first viewed the film, but thank you Amazon - I can now!",1296604800,,354,3.9577464788732395
1803574,3,B00007AJE8,"""Hoffman"" is tale of a a novel, perhaps intimidating, approach by a shy man to seek a romantic relationaship with a work colleague by exercising a form of blackmail. His victim has 'agreed' to stay with the hero for a week and obey his every command. Over that period the relationship changes from predation and fear to one of mutual affection.

The plot is quite well worked out, and the acting is excellent. The hroine's change of heart is too rapid to be believable, however.",1271203200,,478,4.623529411764705
1803575,4,B00007AJE8,"Certainly one of Sellers' weirdest roles, Hoffman contains some of the most strangely acerbic lines I've ever heard in such a seemingly low-key film. While both Sellers and Cusack are good, the real star here is the script by Ernest Gebler, based on his play. Every few minutes Sellers utters yet another bizarrely true statement that is almost always oddly hilarious, and also somehow unsettling when delivered by Sellers in his deadpan way.

It's hard not to laugh at Sellers even when he's serious; like Bill Murray, his face is just funny, even in repose. Or maybe it's just one's memory of all the laughs that face has produced. Either way, what are supposed to be somewhat serious lines here take on odd overtones, and the entire film is truly strange, even creepy, until the rather cheesy end.

The fact is, Sellers has blackmailed this secretary at his job into living with him for a week. Uh, that's a major felony, right? But here it's all played as a lark, and Cusack barely protests at the quasi-rape aspect. Imagine if this film was made today! But it all passes as innocuous, and as she predictably begins to fall for his semi-sophistication, the whole monstrous nature of the affair seems to recede. I had trouble getting past that; sexual blackmail morphing into a light romantic comedy?

In any case, Sellers makes the most of his many startling lines here and delivers a performance unique in his canon, both serious and ironic, and one senses that he identifies strongly with this character. Which is pretty odd, seeing as how weird Hoffman is. It gets rather slow about an hour in and is 15 minutes too long for my taste, and I'm a huge Sellers fan. It's certainly worth watching for Sellers devotees, and is more of a very black comedy than any sort of romance, which makes the denouement all the dimmer.

A much weirder yet eventually more boring film than most reviews here suggest, Hoffman is good. But it's no masterpiece by a long shot, and I'd rate it well down the list of Sellers' best, beneath Heavens Above, the PP movies, Being There, and a number of others.",1270425600,2,2090,4.671195652173913

What may be bad about this movie, is that it might give others ""ideas"" about

1803581,5,B00007AJE8,"I first saw Hoffman when I was about 20 years old.  It made enough of an impression on me even then, that I made a mental note of it and filed it away in my mind for future reference.  Now I'm in my fifties and the things I learned from Hoffman over 30 years ago still ring true.  Despite what might be considered a ""corny"" plot, the film deals with how middle-aged men are perceived by society and how they perceive themselves when they find themselves to be losers in the game of love.  Hoffman decides to change the rules of the game.  Any man who has ever felt that his chance at love in life had passed him by needs to see Hoffman.  While I wouldn't advocate using Hoffman's precise strategy, I would say Hoffman proves that the game isn't over as long as there is breath in our bodies and we can still come out as 'winners.'  As Hoffman (Peter Sellers) tells the young love interest, Miss Smith, regarding ""middle aged men with hound dog faces,"" - ""It's our time!""",1233964800,4,970,4.2967032967032965
1803582,5,B00007AJE8,"This is a masterpiece, there is no denying it!  Sellers never showed us this side outside of a few glimpes in ""Being There"".  This is his most honest and touching work.  I was terribly moved by the performances.  The music and title song are perfect in every way.  The piano work in select scenes is superb.

 Many of sellers comments are so true.  ""Reality betray's us all"" so true so true my friends! The opening with Matt Monroe singing in the background the Sinead driving to Sellers flat in the taxi....oh my goodness this is great stuff.  I wish we could just go back to this time period...I truly do. A time when you could almost take for granted films like this one, there was so much amazing going in 1970.  Now today it's a rare treasure in the midst of a sea of hollywood refuse.

GET THIS FILM!",1212537600,3,806,4.342281879194631
1803583,5,B00007AJE8,"I must begin by confessing I am a very big fan of Sellers, and through many reviews here and at IMDB decided to purchase this DVD even though I have never seen this film. Let me say that it is truly worth a look as well as repeated viewings. Sellers eyes appear as the saddest ever in cinema. That is how we are introduced to his character as he opens his door we see the saddest and loniest expression captured in his eyes. Wonderful dark comedy and character study but also has some romantic touches. Little seen gem that I recommned to all not just the Sellers fan. Ranks with Being There and The Optimists as his greatest dramatic roles. Remember: ""Reality betrays us all.""",1203033600,5,677,4.424
1803584,5,B00007AJE8,This is one of my favourite films.  It is a beautiful colour masterpiece from 1969 and one of the best British films of the 60s.  It is not a Sellers comedy but a witty and charming domestic drama and satirical love story.  It takes a middle-aged reactionary view of the sexual liberation of the 60s.  It is technically outstanding in every way with a fine score by Ron Grainer.  I find it haunting and magical.  For me it is one of his best.,1174608000,2,442,4.265060240963855
1803585,5,B00007AJE8,"The service was brilliant.

I have not reviewed the DVD as I am a collector and it will stay cellophaned.",1167868800,,105,4.25
1803586,5,B00007AJE8,"Along with Being There, Dr. Strangelove, a rarity called The Optimists and Lolita, this ranks among Peter Sellers' finest dramatic performances. As the story unfolds, fans who know Sellers only as Inspector Clouseau from the Pink Panther films may wonder, even recoil, at his choice of this role. For, although Benjamin Hoffman is an ostensibly respected, successful businessman, at an emotional and personal level he is a desperate, devious and downright nasty guy who is blackmailing his secretary to spend a week in his bed. He hopes, anyway--and expects, for the purpose of a consummated union. As if the currency of his physical demands could satisfy his emotional bills.

Why, indeed, did Peter Sellers want us to care about this apparently despicable fellow? Why, as always, does he use humor to humanize and expose the vulnerability and sensitivity of this otherwise unlikable chap?  Why does he want us to look deeper, to understand that beneath Hoffman's embittered surface lie hopes, dreams, a heart that was betrayed?

For years, Sellers claimed publicly that his own identity eluded him; that, if asked to play himself, he would not have the first idea how to do so. His choice of the role of Benjamin Hoffman is a resounding testament as close to an admission of self-perception as you're likely to find. I believe that he did recognize his own shortcomings, but he could only admit them to himself from the safe distance of a role.

In any case, this is a really beautiful performance from Sellers. How bold it must have been, by late 1960s standards, to portray with such depth the loneliness, desperation, borderline neurosis of a man facing middle age alone. The chemistry between Sellers and Sinead Cusack as the young and reluctant secretary is terrific. And as always, Sellers brings to bear his amazing insight into human frailty to make us laugh, to redeem this tortured soul, Hoffman.

If you're looking for a movie with something deeper than the technology-laden plots and superficially written characters we see all too often these days, have a look at this. The ending, albeit dreamily optimistic, is heartwarming and hopeful, and I think you'll find you do care about Hoffman.",1159833600,4,2204,5.0109289617486334
1803587,5,B00007AJE8,"It's a shame that one of the greatest actors ever to grace the screen is best remembered for such complete and utter buffoonery as the Clouseau character; one which Sellers himself loathed.  Anyone unfamiliar with Peter's dramatic performances has no idea of the depths of this man's talents, and Hoffman is one of his best.

Terrifying, creepy, but ultimately touching, this film is deliciously reminiscent of not only Anthony Hopkins' brilliant interpretation of Hannibal Lecter, but also of his Stevens the Butler in The Remains of the Day.  So much so, in fact, that one must wonder if Hopkins had not gained some inspiration for his performances from Sellers' ""Hoffman.""  In the same vein, it makes one wonder what Peter would have done with the Lecter and Stevens characters, had he the opportunity to sink his teeth into them.  Perhaps no one else, living or dead, could improve upon the existing status quo, much to Hopkins' credit.

Hoffman is purely a character study, of no interest whatever to those who gravitate towards explosions and car crashes in their movie fare.

Comparable to a freshly dug onion-dirty on the surface, then strong and offensive as the skin is removed, there seems to be no likable aspect to Benjamin Hoffman at all.  He presents himself a predator, an emotional vampire, an antagonistic misogynist with the filthiest of minds, unapologetically intent on utterly humiliating his prey (brilliantly portrayed by Sinead Cusack)...

""I want to eat you.  I want to consume you.  I want to lick your knees.""

And...

""You must never become a person, Miss Smith.  That would be unendurable.""

As the layers peel away, however, we are presented with a diamond mine of emotional cat-and-mouse, longing and repression.  Eventually, subtle cracks begin to appear in the facade; slowly giving way to a final, last-ditch, desperate tearing down of the defenses Benjamin Hoffman has meticulously constructed to insulate himself from the risks and horrors of true intimacy.  What emerges is a touching and heartwarming love story from a very different time, with one of the sweetest ending scenes ever.

A brilliant, unforgettable film.",1141084800,9,2157,5.114285714285714
1803588,5,B00007AJE8,"A lonely man, terribly disappointed since his last amorous failure, decides to make a long and complicated journey to win the favor of a young lady who could be his own daughter. She will blackmail her and the pact is to spent a week with him.

The smart script is enriched with bitter and caustic dialogues; scented with that discrete charm where you immediately tie up with Vladimir Nabokov ` s Lolita. If you notice carefully the amazing resembling between Sinead Cussack and Sue Lyon you will coincide with me. It's an intimate chamber work that depicts three fundamental characters: the man in question, our candide girl and her naive boyfriend.  A clever and modern fable that shows us nobody is absolutely out of game in what love concerns. When you have talent, imagination and good taste the door is open.

A mature film that will let you thinking for a long, long time.",1139788800,4,879,4.694805194805195

I wanted to add that Peter Sellers plays it straight here, the film is unpredictable, moving, touching and uplifting, and VERY romantic.  I wanted to add my two cents for women in particular- I loved Persuasion and Pride and Prejudice and I love this too, somehow it seems cut from the same cloth (it's the wit and the marvelous dialogue).  Sort of an English Murphy's Romance with twists and turns and more depth.  Lovely Sinead Cusack (spelling?) played Demi Moore's mother in Passion of Mind and I believe she's been married to Jeremy Irons since the 60's- she is wonderful as Miss Smith.  This is about who holds power in relationships, generosity, giving, and longing.  Highly, highly recommended!",1059609600,21,878,4.774834437086093
