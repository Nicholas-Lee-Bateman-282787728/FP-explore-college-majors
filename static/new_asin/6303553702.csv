For those of you or may not know about this, but you train buffs are in for a big treat, footage from ""There Goes A Train"" is used in certain scenes and I enjoyed that adventure as well (except it had ""Engineer Dave""). Anywho, I really enjoyed Smokey Jones and his magical ways of showing the kids about the world of trains and that it isn't safe to play on or around railroad tracks as well as rail yards. Definitely good for ALL ages and good for hard core train buffs like me!",1380585600,,591,4.103448275862069
8074021,5,6303553702,"I must say i had little hope to find this video. I used to watch this all the time back when i was younger and wished i could go to The Magical World of Trains with Smokey Jones. When the tape went missing around the age of 8 i was devastated. Now that i'm 18 and have the means to ""track"" this video down, i jumped at the opportunity. I can not wait until it arrives so i can relive my childhood again.",1355529600,,403,3.8674698795180724
8074022,2,6303553702,"My 2-year old loves this video -- we all enjoy the good opening/closing song, lots of train pix, and other little kid characters... BUT!  The dialoge is irritatingly cheesey, and the ""Smokey Jones"" character is not only totally hokey, but shows little kids that it's okay for them to go away to ""magic train land"" with a strange man by holding on to his rear end!  Who wrote this?  Do yourself a favor and stick to ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" and ""Trains: Up Close & Personal"" !",971049600,33,475,4.436781609195402
