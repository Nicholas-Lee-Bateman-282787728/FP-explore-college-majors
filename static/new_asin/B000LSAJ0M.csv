2713896,5,B000LSAJ0M,"There are several reasons to consider 'Sun Kissed' an exceptional movie.  What most impressed me is the light it throws on the male world that hates discovering itself as gay, even though this impulse is a reality of its own soul depths. Contemplating the evolution of Leo, we witness his slow sexual awakening, in painful conflict with the prejudices of the character, obsessed with the idea ""I am not homosexual.""  So it is he, the supposed heterosexual, who appears inwardly divided to the point of schizophrenia, in contrast to Teddy, who knows very well that he is ""completely"" gay and draws a remarkable inner balance from this consciousness, in spite of his moments of despair.  As such he  shows himself to be healthier and more mature than Leo, even taking a certain protecting and enlightening role toward him.

It is also possible to take into consideration the philosophical aspect of this love story, urging us to reflect about fate, death and the meaning of life, and the sense of love in its relation to solitude. Do we love only because, otherwise, this solitude would be unbearable?

And over these issues hangs a meditative and poetic spirit that ennobles the sexual side, naturally predominant.  The loneliness of these two souls in the middle of the loneliness of Nature creates a nearly magical atmosphere.  I felt incited to view this captivating movie again, as one might listen again to the music of a great master.",1179792000,6,1439,4.893004115226337
8164095,4,B000LSAJ0M,"Depending on how you view the world and the nature of art, this film will either bore and confuse or excite and challenge. The non-linear plot line meanders, crisscrossing, doubling back on time and space.  The premise of the plot may or may not be true; the characters may or may not exist; the nightmares may be recollections or hallucinations. The characters, if they exist, are imperfect, but the themes of self-realization and love are universal. "" I have it in me so much nearer home to scare myself with my own desert places.""",1364774400,,533,4.670212765957447
8164096,2,B000LSAJ0M,"Usually I 'wish list' movies that may not be keepers, and only buy those that sound like good candidates for my permanent collection, based on editorial descriptions and reviews.  This one went on the block as soon as I watched it.",1357430400,,231,4.634146341463414
8164097,4,B000LSAJ0M,I'd watched the trailer and wanted to see the movie. I really wasn't dissapointed. I'm glad I bought it. It was a good purchase.,1356393600,,128,4.375
8164098,1,B000LSAJ0M,"The only word to describe ""Sun Kissed"" is amateurish.  The acting is bad.  The dialogue is bad.  The songs (or maybe it's the same song) that pop up about every five minutes, are bad.  Worst aspect of all is the grainy photography, which makes it almost painful to watch the thing.

Maybe things got better as the movie progressed, but I could only stand about thirty minutes.  After the second (or was it the third) time our hero started dancing in drag I gave up.

Great things can be made on a small budget.  Unfortunately, ""Sun Kissed"" is not one of them.",1321488000,,559,4.411764705882353
8164099,2,B000LSAJ0M,"There is something missed in this story of a student writing his first novel in an isolated house of his professor who had additionally supplied him with younger, twenty-year-old-already-widowed carer experimenting with his sexuality in this professor's beach-house king-size bed.

A very ordinary work indeed also actors performed well.",1267488000,,337,5.877551020408164
8164100,5,B000LSAJ0M,"I'm greatly (and, it seems, unusually) blessed in being able to enjoy things without understanding them. I have no idea what Sun Kissed is ""about"": whether Leo and Teddy are one person, or two, or none; whether this is a coming out story or a psychological allegory or a murder mystery, or all three, or something else; whether anybody was murdered or when; whether anything in this movie actually happened or not. I don't know, and I don't care.

I happen to love movies like this, that defy understanding, that force me either to accept them on their own terms and see if I can enjoy them, or reject them. I gave Sun Kissed a chance, and I'm very glad I did.

I understood nothing, and I enjoyed every second, from the first frame to the last note in the dark. I don't know what it was, and I don't know why, but I sure did like it. It was a rich, lush, sensual experience that I'd welcome any time, anywhere.",1245974400,2,911,4.321637426900585
8164101,2,B000LSAJ0M,"Bad acting, bad dialogue. Another interminable exposition of a coming out story, told by the whining writer character to the straight guy he is so transparently trying to seduce.

Luckily I pressed eject on the remote control 20 minutes after it started., because if I had both hands free I may have clawed my eyes out.

There are better short films available for free on You-Tube.",1241913600,,381,4.757575757575758
8164102,1,B000LSAJ0M,"This is a nothing movie with a nothing story that feels and looks like a bad high school play.  The cute guys by themselves do not make the movie interesting or compelling.  I'd avoid this completely, and certianly rent it first if it looks interesting to you.  I think you'll be disappointed.",1186099200,5,293,4.596153846153846
8164103,1,B000LSAJ0M,"I am still waiting for the delivery of my movie. I ordered 14 DVD movies of all sorts, all at the same time on June 7th. 12 of my movies were delivered in 3 days, 1 in four days, but am STILL WAITING ON MY MOVIE -Sun Kissed, as of June 22nd! What gives with the delivery?",1182470400,,271,3.7719298245614037
8164104,1,B000LSAJ0M,"I recently purchased this movie and watched it last night for the first and last time.  The quality of the film was horrible, sections of the movie must have been filmed with an 8 mm camera as they were so grainy it reminded me of old 1965 home movies.  In some scenes, the lighting was so glaring, the figures were almost completely washed out.  That's just the quality of the film.

Now we get to the content.  I found the story to be disjointed and totally bizarre.  I love good looking men and the two actors protraying Leo and Teddy were hot, but the story, or lack of it, turned me completely off.",1182211200,2,603,4.292035398230088
