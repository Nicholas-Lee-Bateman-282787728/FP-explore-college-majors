8331423,1,B001OSWK6E,"Even though it came shrink wrapped, I am so glad that I opened this box before I gave it to my soon to be sister-in-law as a bridal shower gift!  Both DVD's included were titled 'Pleasure Your Woman' & 'Pleasuring Your Woman version 2' - where is the man's CD as advertised?  The box contained two tealights - where are the 3 votive candles as advertised?  The box contained one tube of Cocoa Butter Hand and Body lotion - where is the bottle of massage oil as advertised?  The box did not contain the two packs of bath gel as advertised, so the only thing as expected was the pack of ten incense cones - not candles, but cones.  The box itself does look like a movie theater treat holder, which would be ok, but the inside was completely inaccurate and hastily thrown together with maybe a handful of the crinkly shredded paper lining the bottom to make it a ""gift"" basket.  This is definitely being returned!  For $40 I can go to an adult store and do much better on my own... I'm very disappointed.",1332892800,4,1001,4.349462365591398
8331424,1,B001OSWK6E,"The stuff comes in a white cardboard box with cardboard handles that were squooshed and crumpled.  The 2 DVDs are packaged as 1, and the cover makes it look like grainy black and white porn.  The Music CD looks nice, the massage oil looks kind of silly and juvenile, but OK.  The 3 little votive candles look cheesey and I really don't know what the 3 tiny baggies of crunchy stuff are -- bath stuff?",1283212800,3,400,4.306666666666667
