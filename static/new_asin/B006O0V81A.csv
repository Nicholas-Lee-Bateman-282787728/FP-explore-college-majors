8501528,5,B006O0V81A,"Justin Russell's THE SLEEPER is a slasher film in the tradition of the 1970's and 1980's, films such as BLACK CHRISTMAS, HALLOWEEN, HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE, DON'T GO IN THE HOUSE, and yes, FRIDAY THE 13TH. A killer with unusual eyes make obscene phone calls to a group of sorority sisters before slaughtering them and anybody who is nearby. His primary weapon is a hammer, but he uses a rope, ax, kitchen knife, and even his gloved hands! Who will survive this rampage of death and destruction?

While not always accurate in period detail, THE SLEEPER works on so many levels. The kills are shocking and gruesome when applicable, the acting is just right for this kind of movie, and there is actual suspense generated! Plus it has some of those nice, cheesy moments many fans of the genre have come to love about slasher movies; the dance sequence, with its rap song, put a smile on my face as it reminds me of PIECES. Look for Joe Bob Briggs at the end!

Like THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, another brilliant homage horror movie, THE SLEEPER comes in a box set that includes a VHS tape, which is how I watched this movie for the first time. And to truly appreciate what THE SLEEPER accomplishes is to watch the VHS first, as it bares out the atmosphere and period flavor. I recommend THE SLEEPER to those who truly appreciate and love the horror scene of the 1970's and 1980's and support independent horror movies! Nighty night!",1336348800,3,1421,4.546875
8501529,5,B006O0V81A,"Justin Russell's 80's throwback, The Sleeper, is the best slasher film that 1981 never had. I was privilaged enough to watch the VHS version of the film and in my opinion, is the way the film was meant to be seen. Dark, gritty, and well shot, I was amazed that this film was even shot in 2011. And furthermore, shot digitally. I loved being taken back to a time when horror films were meant to be ENTERTAINING above anything else.

I'm sure plenty of people will have their ""beef"" with the films authenticity, but I think you should all get over it. The film was shot with hardly a budget in sight and with the help of friends. Also shot in only 13 days. Hell, even our beloved 80's slashers were shot on film (not cheap) and at least had some budget. Not to mention, all of the remakes/reimaginings we've been force-fed through the past 10 years can't hold a torch to this film. They lack, hold onto yourselves... HEART!

The Sleeper is an entertaining watch and a fun walk down memory lane. Any so-called slasher fan should find this film as much fun as I found it to be. Justin Russell is a true talent and I can only image what he could do given even bigger budgets.

Order The Sleeper now while there's still a breath left in your body.",1328140800,4,1241,4.3405172413793105
