7133071,2,B00WLX3LB4,"Continuing a string of recent Bolly improvements with film topics such as women's rights; child disappearances, this one deals with Bolly's obsession with selling/promoting superficial skinny model features to an audience to whom this is an unrealistic fantasy (well, OK a common selling attribute in media though out the world). Made worse when that audience is largely uneducated and stuck in poverty.
The reason this film is not more highly rated is that it was an unrealistic happy/feel good storybook ending. Especially, carrying twice the weight over a long cross country course. A little too made up.
Other Bollys of recent good quality are ""Badlapur"", ""NH 10"" and ""Ugly"".",1435795200,,679,5.238532110091743

7133074,4,B00WLX3LB4,"Watched this one in Dubai recently. It's warm, funny and completely charming in an understated sort of way. Bhumi Pednekar steals the show as an overweight woman struggling to reconcile with her husband's inferiority complex. She's smart and educated; he's a callow high-school dropout. The supporting cast are stellar, especially Sanjay Mishra, Sheeba Chaddha, Alka Amin and Seema Pahwa. (Mishra and Pahwa seemed to have walked off the sets of Rajat Kapoor's Ankhon Dekhi to re-enact similar roles here.) If anything, Ayushman Khurana feels like the weak link here.

This is a lovely movie, rich and earthy, quite different from the usual YRF gloss. Do watch it.",1430870400,6,663,5.196261682242991

7133077,2,B00WLX3LB4,"Prem (Ayushmann Khurrana) is persuaded by his family to marry for financial reasons to an overweight woman he doesn't find attractive.  His new wife, Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar ) is an educated woman who tries to make her marriage work, but Prem has no interest in so doing.  They are persuaded to take part in the ""Dum Lagao"" contest, where the husband carries his wife on his back through an obstacle course, in so doing they reconcile.

The premise of this movie is fantastic, but it just doesn't deliver.  There is very little character development, less happiness, and an ending that is too sudden and not credible.  Khurrana, who is too old for the role, wears a scowl the entire movie and plays his part one-dimensionally. Pednekar, in her first movie, is fantastic, giving depth to Sandhya, portraying believable emotions, and acting nearly flawlessly.  Her performance is so good that she nearly saves the movie, but not quite.",1494288000,2,933,4.910828025477707

I loved seeing this arranged marriage become a love connection.  I thought the race where the husband carries the wife was endearing and spoke volumes about what the marriage should be. This couple, with nothing to lose, learned to be true partners and find in each other the gems.",1453593600,,431,4.512820512820513
7133095,5,B00WLX3LB4,"After a long time I watched a movie that remind true to its flavor. The movie is set in small town of India and throughout the movie , they have maintained the innocence and authenticity of a small town. The story is simple and unlike most of the Bollywood movies, they have not added unnecessary melodrama. The Biggest selling point for me was the fact that the heroine of the movie is shown as confident, smart and not shy of expressing herself. Its a sweet and simple love story. I highly recommend.",1449964800,4,502,4.467391304347826

7133105,4,B00WLX3LB4,"This is for the most part an exceptionally nice film. The cast is terrific, the settings feel real, and there is a good range of emotion and humor. The one thing that holds it back for much of the first half or two-thirds is that the male lead is hard to empathize with. Until you have watched it all the way through, he just seems to be a petty, whining loser. I really related to and felt for the female lead, but certainly thought that she deserved better than this guy, and was losing interest in the story because of him. The ultimate emotional climaxe(s) finally build a balanced into the dynamic, though.",1443484800,5,611,4.415929203539823

7133107,5,B00WLX3LB4,"I really liked this movie.  I'm not familiar with the actors but I think they did a great job.  At first, I thought the movie was about how a slim man must realign his idea of beauty after he marries an overweight woman.  Personally, I didn't think she was that overweight and I thought it looked good on her.  She's a pretty girl.  But the movie really wasn't about her weight.  It was about other issues going on inside of him that drove him to reject her.  There was no singing and dancing during the movie.  I liked that too.  There are a couple of good dance numbers after the credits roll however.  I thoroughly recommend this movie.",1442448000,4,639,4.338983050847458
7133108,5,B00WLX3LB4,"this was really a good movie.  I loved the fact that this movie the female is so strong.  here is an arranged marriag, the guy is a highschool drop out and she is a college graduage who wants to be a teacher.  he does not want to marry her b/c she is over weight and kind of plain looking.  he is forced into it. she actually likes him but thinks she cant do any better because of how she looks.  She does end up being the strong one b/c she decide she is worth something and instead of a bad marrige she would rather persue her teaching goals.  She defies society and parents to do what she wants.",1442275200,,598,4.02542372881356

This film is about two Indians whom enter into an arranged marriage. The film is funny, thought provoking and serious. The does have subtitles, so that will limit the audience that will be interested in seeing it. But its worth seeing. I am not sure its worth buying.",1441756800,2,418,4.371794871794871

7133118,5,B00WLX3LB4,"This movie is entertaining while still drawing many emotions from the viewer as hopelessness and hope are intertwined throughout.  I especially like that even though the relationship did not start well, events and introspection (some forced and some not) brought them to a new perspective.  I applaud not only the many subject matters touched on in one film, but the fact that I was drawn into the film and was able to like and feel sympathy  with the characters and enjoy the basic story.  I hope other viewers enjoy this as much as I did.",1437264000,4,540,4.652631578947369
7133119,2,B00WLX3LB4,"Good idea, actors are good, and the actor build-up is excellent but then there is no substance to the story. This movies needs another 20 minutes to develop their relationship. The way it is now, the ending is silly and improbable.",1437264000,,231,4.658536585365853

8713770,5,B00WLX3LB4,"The film portrayed what it's like for young Indian men and women to be thrown into the traditional arranged marriage. I appreciated how realistic it was. Traditional Indian marriages are often financial investments made by the parents and the movie did a nice job of bringing that to life. It did that by showing the importance of the dowry system, the arguing and the insults that namely new wives have to forgo from her in-laws and through the manipulation of the family members. It was at times light hearted but also realistic and sad. I did feel like the couple's romance could have been better developed. I would watch it again.",1520812800,,634,4.7207207207207205
