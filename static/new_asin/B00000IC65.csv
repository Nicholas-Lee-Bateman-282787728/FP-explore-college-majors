7909926,5,B00000IC65,"First off, I would like to say that Slayers is the all time best Anime out there, nothing else comes even close (well, maybe DBZ, or Ranma, but not that close). And the Next series is my absolute favorite! But then I  haven't seen the Try, so maybe that'll change. Now, on with the review!  Lina sees a sign outside a resturant advertising that they serve Dragon  meat (if your thinking what I'm thinking, no it wasn't put there by Xellos)  So she and her pals go in to try this fabulous food. Unfortunately the food  they get isn't fit for mazoku, which pisses our favorite little sorceroress  off. She charges into the kitchen and demands a refund, but instead she  gets offered a chance to go catch a real dragon with this cowboy cook,  Ashram. So the crew sets out (minus Xellos, he sits in a tree and ridicules  the gang for most of the episode) to a lake to catch a dragon. But wait,  they forgot an anchor. Hmm, now who on earth would be heavy as a rock?  ZELGADIS! Lina tosses him in, and the poor chimera gets dragged around the  bottom of the lake a couple of times. Then they need bait, so who does Lina  toss in next, Gourry! So now, the blonde boy and his buddy Zelgadis are  being dragged around and chewed on by the lake dragon. This is a hilarous  episode, watching the dragon picture Gourry as a fishie is soooo funny. And  Ashram giving Zelgadis mouth to mouth after they pull him up had me  laughing so hard that soda came out my nose (and ouch, that hurts! ) And  the real kicker is who Zelgadis looks like to Ashram (yes there is a reason  thatr Ashram gives him mouth to mouth ^_^) After this episode is over, Lina  and the Gang travel to Seyruun to search for a Clair Bible, and Amelia  finds out her daddy is dead. But the last episodes aren't nearly as good as  the first one! GET IT NOW Or else! ^_^",955843200,3,1825,4.213872832369942
