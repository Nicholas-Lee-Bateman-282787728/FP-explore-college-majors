5680532,5,B00BXHLM1K,"If you're the type of opera fan who rejects an opera as bad based on liberties taken with the setting then this production isn't for you.

If, however, you're the type of person who values the quality of the music and the main requirement you have of the setting is that it not distract you with odd incongruities when you're watching the performance then I think you'll enjoy this. I've seen productions of Don Giovanni set in modern times, for example, that still kept the sword fighting. That's distracting to me. If an opera is set in a time where the gender norms are so wildly different that the story doesn't make sense, then that's distracting.

But the updated setting here of 1960's Las Vegas (and the characters mapping to members of the rat pack) is very clever. Because the 60's were so culturally riotous it doesn't distract to have a lecherous duke along-side a religious (and maybe naive) Gilda.

I think I still would prefer to see these performers in a more traditional staging, but I can appreciate this production for its cleverness and I thoroughly enjoy it for the talent of the performers.",1373155200,3,1112,4.6923076923076925
5680533,4,B00BXHLM1K,"The Tosca is, by far, the best I have ever seen.  Terfel is a very evil, and complex Scarpia.  He was born for this role.  Jonas Kauffmann, perhaps the best tenor we have these days is a tall, handsome Mario, in splendid voice, and a wonderful actor.  The surprise for me was Gheorghiu.  I must reevaluate her.  She was a wonderful Tosca.  Her Tosca was very moving.  The Vissi d'art was a heartbreaker.  This whole production made dramatic sense.  The sets were magnificent.  I cannot recommend this highly enough.

The Rigoletto was fine, but I found the setting, moved to Rat Pack Las Vegas, very distracting.  Beckszala is in wonderful voice, good looking, and a fine actor.  Lucic was mostly a heartbreaking Rigoletto, but Diana Damrau quite uneven.  She got better as the opera progressed.",1372896000,2,795,4.785185185185185

It's a shame to see talented singers stoop so low as to perform great works of operatic literature in surroundings that the composers and librettists would find appalling and completely disrespectful. Last year the Met degraded Gounod's ""Faust"" and Goethe's poetic masterpiece by placing Faust in a nuclear power plant. This year the Met has degraded Verdi's great masterpiece ""Rigoletto"" by placing him in the cheap glitter of Las Vegas. It appears that the Met has decided to hire set designers who either don't have any appreciation for what the composer and literary source had in mind or, perhaps, have never read the the literature or librettos that inspired great composers like Gounod and Verdi. Yes, there is always a audience for trashy productions, but it is a sign of disrespect and ignorance to applaud such trash.",1371686400,17,1129,5.726190476190476

5680538,2,B00BXHLM1K,"The 2013 RIGOLETTO, set in the Vegas of the Rat Pack era, was the opera debut of another in Met GM Peter Gelb's long line of distinguished non-opera directors. Once in a while there is a bit of stage business devised by Michael Mayer that suggests someone who does good work in his own milieu, for example, the hitman casually jotting his name on a matchbook while singing, and insistently pressing it into Rig's hand. But for all the ink spilled on the production's outrageousness (by those who hated it) and its innovations (mostly by those trying to sell tickets to it), this is essentially a cosmetic update. It puts a lot of bright color and ""novelty"" in front of us, and there is an air of self-satisfaction about it just for that. But it brings no special insight or point of view to the work, as real Regietheater is supposed to do. It is a busy traditional RIGOLETTO with different kinds of detritus in everyone's way.

No one sounds particularly good (is this set an acoustic challenge, perhaps? Or was it just February cold season in New York?), and conductor Michele Mariotti is a klutz, making no better an impression with a great orchestra than he has in the past with a poor one (PURITANI from Bologna). His fast tempi are very fast, which is fine, but he simply lets the music tumble out shapelessly, leaving the singers to snatch breaths where they can. The result is almost anti-phrasing, and no matter how they are caricatured by their harshest critics, Toscanini and Muti did not lead performances of Italian opera this way. I was wincing even in the rapid-fire exchanges before ""Questa o quella,"" and matters did not improve. I doubt even native Italian speakers could make much of the words with such graceless leadership; this international cast is at sea.

Zeljko Lucic (Rigoletto) and Diana Damrau (Gilda) have appeared previously in these roles in a 2008 DVD performance from Dresden conducted by Fabio Luisi, the production (also in modern dress) by Nikolaus Lehnhoff. Their Duke was Juan Diego Flrez. That performance is urgently recommended above this one. Lucic's blustery, unfocused singing at the Met is a liability. In his present state, he has the technical shortcomings of Tito Gobbi in this music (a constricted, hooded top and a flinty basic sound), but without the stylistic and expressive resources. Piotr Beczala has never looked better than in the Duke's white tux, but he has sung better, even at the Met (LUCIA, MANON). Stefan Kocan also looks great in the clothes, but his ubiquity in bass roles at the Met is hard to understand. The sound is lightweight for much of what is thrown his way, and he is not a special actor or interpreter, just a good-looking man with a pleasant timbre. For its previous video release of RIGOLETTO (1977), the Met could field Isola Jones for Maddalena and John Cheek for Monterone. Their 2013 counterparts are adequate and poor, respectively.

Damrau merits slightly more extended discussion. Having recently given birth, she is heavier than usual and is undermined by costumes that are not as concealing as they could be. She is slow to warm up vocally, and does not sound close to a representative form until the opera's second half (the first father/daughter duet and ""Caro nome"" go for little...not the case in Dresden '08). But one thing must be said on her behalf: she understands this character. She gets things right that I believe owe less to Michael Mayer's direction than to experience and sympathy with the role of Gilda. There is a tragic ambiguity to Gilda's view of the Duke, and even when she realizes he is a cad, she carries feelings for him that she understands as love. She has given something of herself to him, and it is a payment the truth cannot refund to her. In the hands of someone who acts the part sensitively, Gilda is a very touching character, not an annoying or insipid one. On that part of the assignment, Damrau delivers.

Another of Mayer's bits that I liked was Gilda's smelling the Duke's jacket while Rigoletto rages after his daughter's attack. This is eloquent and tasteful, and there are other such little moments in the margins, such as the direction of Marullo (ashamed) in the pleading episode of Rigoletto's big scene with the courtiers. Peter Gelb has been loyal to directors (giving Bartlett Sher and Mary Zimmerman chance after chance, despite their misfires); perhaps Mayer will be more on target the second time. More subtlety, less gimmickry, please.

In truth, the best vocal performance is Met mezzo stalwart Maria Zifchak's deft Giovanna (in beehive). With all considerable due respect to Ms. Zifchak, this is not good news.

The English subtitles are irritatingly updated to a '60s colloquial style of speaking (""doll"" and ""big shot"" and ""rubbed out"" and so on). They frequently have only a handshake acquaintance with the text, and they are tin-eared overkill.

While not a disaster, this was a ""C""-grade afternoon for the Met, neither the best work of anyone involved nor an HD broadcast I will want to revisit. For all the bright lights on the stage, there is precious little in the way of illumination.",1371427200,12,5137,4.824063564131668
5680539,5,B00BXHLM1K,"I too was apprehensive about the NEW Rigoletto when I heard it was updated into the Las Vegas Rat Pack theme, but I was delighted to see this performance at the MET and enjoyed the production and singing immensely.

I understand the protests of opera purists, we've gone through many changes at the Met and in opera and it's not like ""Back in the days"". I prefer to be open minded, some I have liked, some not, but folks, it's a new age.

Having not seen the HD performance OR the Great Performances I still bought the HD DVD. I think it is great that DG released it so soon. The clarity of viewing is superb and the singing just as fine as when I saw it live. I'm glad to have it in my collection.

So excited about this Rigoletto and that I have it on my subscription for the Met next season with Dmitri Hovorostovsky as Rigoletto!",1370304000,7,833,4.226415094339623
5680540,1,B00BXHLM1K,"I have attended many Rigoletto performances some, excellent and memorable, some less than excellent, but I have never seen a performance with total disrespect to the essence of the period and the libretto. They are using gangster cant, more suitable to Damon Runyon.

I wounder if the Met. management could make Mr. Levine or any other conductor of his caliber to participate. I guess I will never know, but I have my suspicion.",1370217600,11,517,4.886363636363637
5680541,1,B00BXHLM1K,"Admittedly, my review comes, not from the DVD, but from televison's ""Great Performances at the Met"" presentation
Before the performance began, an opening segment indicated that portions of the presentation might be offensive to some people.  How right they were.  The entire production was offensive to me.  And, in her opening remarks, Renee Fleming said, ""Here is OUR (capitals for emphasis) Rigoletto.""  And so it was; it was certainly not Verdi's Rigoletto.
Beyond taking the story totally out of context, the biggest problem was that the character and relationships of Rigoletto are never clarified.  At one point, he sings, ""I have to do what the Duke tells me.""  Why?  What was the hold the the Duke has over him?  In Verdi's Rigoletto, he is the jester in the Duke's court, and that makes sense.  And, why do all the other courtiers despise him so?  In Verdi's Rigoletto, he constantly taunts them.  Why does Monterone curse him?  (Actually, the English subtitles imply that he is cursing the Duke.)  In Verdi's opera, Rigoletto has made fun of Monterone's concern for his daughter.  As the Classical Review reviewed, ""Verdi seemed only a peripheral concern"" in this production.
When I was twenty years old, the Met came to the city where I lived, one of only three times they toured to that city.  I was not interested; but my wife coerced me to attend with her.  The production was Rigoletto, with Robert Merrill, Jan Peerce, and Roberta Peters.  (I have tried, unsuccessfully, to find who designed that production.)  That was when the opera bug bit me.
I am grateful that they were not playing this Michael Mayer production.  If they had been, my disdain for opera would have intensified, and I would have missed sixty years of opera enjoyment.
That rumbling sound you hear is Verdi turning over in his grave.",1368835200,40,1820,4.869706840390879
