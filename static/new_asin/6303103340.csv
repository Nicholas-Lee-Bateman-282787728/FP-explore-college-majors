People who even know who Jrgen Prochnow is tend to already be fans of the character actor. And why not? He's a talented combination of intense, wry, sexy and slightly nuts. He'll be genuinely tender with the female characters, in a way that can't be faked, and then smile mischievously while having another character horribly tortured. He can do more acting with his eyes alone in one film, than the overpaid wads of fluff populating the average DVD collection can do in a whole career.

Too bad he was born in Germany, apparently rendering him unfit to play anything but villains in American films.

I sat down to watch ""Killing Cars"", in which Prochnow is the self-absorbed romantic lead, after reading a review elsewhere by a Prochnow fangirl. I wanted to see what was on the other end of the spectrum of his movies from the immortal ""Das Boot"", one of my favorite films. I was expecting utter garbage--I mean, a low-budget foreign car movie shot in 1985? I thought I'd be watching it through my fingers. Actually, it was surprisingly entertaining.

The early 80s sleaze factor is turned up to eleven here, especially in the beginning. Porches, neon, punks, industrial lofts, feathered hair, smoking, spy subplots...it's utter camp. Prochnow actually puts on sunglasses at night to drive. But the characters--at least the core 3 or 4--become a bit more sympathetic as the movie goes on, largely due to the understated seriousness with which Prochnow approached the role. What is it with that guy?

I thought this would be an interesting case of how a good actor could be dragged down by a bad script, low budget, and subpar supporting actors. In fact, through sheer talent and force of will, Prochnow made the movie gel. Sure, it gels into a barely-comprehensible, badly-lit study in hilarious industrial surrealism...but by the climax of the movie, I actually really gave a damn what happened to that ugly car.

The ability of this movie to make me care about it, despite my plans to mock it, hinged on one obscure German actor. That's talent.

The most popular movies nowadays are filled with actors dumber than the average viewer, lending a much-needed ego boost to the audience. People seem content to watch what they know is terrible acting disguised with world-class special effects. After all, special effects don't require emotional engagement, and bad acting presents no mental intimidation.

I guess I just like my actors brilliant and my movies puzzling. If anybody else enjoys feeling their scorn turned to curiosity by intelligent, subtle acting, there are much worse investments of your time than this movie. And if you're a Prochnow fanatic trying to decide whether this is worth the pain, know that he has a nude scene.",1260835200,,2825,4.895397489539749
7837535,3,6303103340,"West German film, also known as ""Blitz, which in my opinion, is the better title for this movie than ""Killing Cars"" (Which is also a bit misleading) as there are actually no killing cars in this movie (Like in say, ""The Car"" or ""Maximum Overdrive""), but like I said, this movie is cheezy, but somehow manages to be fun. The copy I purchased was not from Vidmark, as stated on this site, but I bought a copy from Cineplex Odeon/MCA. I got it on eBay from some guy in Canada/

The movie revolves around Ralph Korda (Played by Jurgen Prochnow from ""Beverly Hills Cop II""), a brilliant automotive engineer who is building The ""World Car"", an environmentaly car that runs withour any kind of gas (A hybrid, if you will.) which, as the back of the box says, could mean a revolution in the international motor business and a threat to all oil producing nations. His project soon comes to a halt by an Arab Oil tycoon who happens to own a large financial stake in BAG. Korda, compelled to complete his ""World Car"" initiates dealings with investors from New York and other tycoons. He soon becomes involved in a violent and deadly gamble with the odds not in his favor. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The movie ends with Korda, having brought back the ""World Car"", now wrecked, back to the company headquaters, with the investor telling Korda that the project has been cancelled.

Overall, there was some unintenionally funny parts, like the guy doing the handstand. That was funny. So if you're into cheeze like this, this is for you. Otherwise, steer clear.

7837536,1,6303103340,"There's no need to beat around the bush: this movie is the worst piece of garbage that I have ever laid my poor eyes upon.
Reason Numbero Uno: The plot doesn't make sense.  The writers never took the time to explain anything that's happening in the movie, so the viewer is left in the dark.
Reason #2: The ""actors"" (as you can tell, I use the term loosely) in this movie don't have enough talent to be an extra in a Cheetos commercial.  Also, their characters are so weak and one dimensional that the viewer ends up wishing that they would all just die unexplainedly, so the movie would end.
Reason #3: The ""futuristic"" car that the main character is making looks like a fancy cardboard box with wheels.
Reason #4: The title doesn't make sense.  There are no killing cars in this movie, even though there is a catchy little number with the name of the movie.
This movie ranks among the most terrible pictures ever.  In fact, it's right up there with stinkers like Revenge of the Dead and Solar Force.  I recommend this movie only to those who are brave enough to experiece serious bouts of rage and frustration.",1017273600,4,1111,4.48019801980198
7837537,3,6303103340,"Jurgen Prochnow stars in a thought-provoking film about economics, politics, and money.  Ralph Korda (Prochnow) stars as the genius engineer responsible for creating the ""WorldCar"" an enviromentally correct automobile made for a multi-national car corporation The Berlin Auto Group.  As word gets out that the ""WorldCar"" has made its debut, everyone wants a piece of the pie.  France pushes Korda into making deals with them, while in the meantime,  a large Arab oil magnate wants him dead in order to maintain the oil market.  All in all, a very interesting film, but gets lost in the confusing end sequences of the film.  I actually give it 3.5 stars if such a thing is possible.  Prochnow is fairly good, and ruthless of course. "" I don't give a damn about the enviroment, my car just happens to be enviromentally safe"" A good view with an interesting story.",984355200,3,861,4.8561643835616435
