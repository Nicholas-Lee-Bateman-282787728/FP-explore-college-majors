I told my self, that as soon as it was released as a Blu-Ray set, I would purchase it.  Not only did it come out, but I got a great deal on Amazon.  Using Prime, I got the order in two days and it was packed perfectly.  Very happy with the order and packing.  I would feel safe letting my child watch these movies.  They are entertaining for both adults and children.",1387756800,2,488,3.9690721649484537

5974791,5,B00FC1ZC2S,"Ice age is a great movie collection for the family, and thought we should start to collect some movies that are appropriate for the kids.  I love the fact that it has ALL of the ""Ice Age"" movies on both blue-ray and DVD so we can play them on any of our devices at home.  Plus a few of the videos came with an ""electronic"" version that you could save to a PC or other electronic media.  We've watched the 4 movies in the series and are saving the ""Christmas"" special for the upcoming holiday.  Haven't had any problems with the videos, they arrived in good condition... GREAT PURCHASE!  Would make for a wonderful family gift.",1387152000,,626,4.362068965517241

5974797,5,B00FC1ZC2S,"Great value set

I am not sure how they managed this but this is a great dvd set. This is a shrunk wrap set from amazon and not an official set, but that does not take away from the quality in the least.

This series definitely hits the mark for being something that is for children that adults can enjoy. Personally, I don't feel that it reaches the heights of Pixar, but it is still a very enjoyable series. While watching this you will get to enjoy the voices of comedians Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Dennis Leary, Jack Black, Cedric the Entertainer and others.

One thing to note here is that my set of discs appears to be different than the set from another reviewer. I have received discs that some are combo sets and others are not. This could just be an issue with amazon as this is a shrink wrap set. Maybe people get different items based on availability? I do not know for sure all I can tell you is what I have seen shipped.

What's Included:

The listing only mentions Blu Ray but you might be surprised at what you will recieve!

Ice Age: Blu Ray/DVD/Digital copy

Ice Age 2 The Meltdown: Blu Ray/DVD/Digital copy

Ice Age 3 Dawn of the Dinosaurs: Blu Ray ONLY

Ice Age 4 Continental Drift: Blu Ray/DVD/Digital copy

Ice Age Christmas Special: Blu Ray/Digital copy ONLY

So with this set almost every set has Blu Ray/DVD/ Digital Copy with the exception of part 3 and the Christmas special.

This is the set I have seen but with these I always advise having customers check with amazon customer service for stuff like this.

I would write something more comprehensive here including dvd/blu ray image and sound quality but these are all newer releases and they are all beautiful. Being kids movies I'm not sure it is worth taking up the review space. If anybody is interested please let me know I would love to share.

There have been many releases of these products but I must say that this is a very good selection at a good price.",1384387200,11,1947,4.432584269662922
5974798,4,B00FC1ZC2S,"The Ice Age movies are a lot of fun and it's good family entertainment.  In particular, I enjoy the squirrel named Scrat, who is by far the most amusing character - kids will no doubt love him and his endless pursuit of acorns.  The technical quality of these films are also very impressive, especially in the blu-ray format.  The animation is quite sharp and distinctive, and the sound mix is also very well done.

For anyone who doesn't own these movies on Blu-Ray, this is a great way to get them all. Please note that this is not a box set, but rather a bundle of individual titles... Each Blu-Ray comes in its own case.  A standard DVD disc is also included for each movie (except the Christmas special), plus they all come with a digital copy.

Each blu-ray disc is packed with a variety of bonus material, including audio commentaries, making-of featurettes, and some additional short films.

The only thing you are missing out on are the 3D versions of the films (because the third and fourth movies were produced in 3D).  But if you aren't into 3D, then that won't matter anyway.

*At this time of this review, this bundle is a featured Deal of the Week for $38.99. Amazon's prices change frequently, and in some cases it may be cheaper to buy the movies individually.",1384041600,23,1277,4.565789473684211

5974811,4,B00FC1ZC2S,"One of my earliest memories was my 1st grade teacher reading a chapter a day to the class about a tribe of prehistoric men, women and children who lived in caves and hunted mammoths.  I found the stories fascinating.  That period of history still fascinates me! .  I am the proud grandmother of eleven and the great grandmother of 17 so I have sat through many, many videos made with children in mind as the principal audience.

  But THESE I bought for MY enjoyment (and to entertain the various grand children or great grand children when they come to visit me!)  The producers of this group of Ice Age animals have managed to bring to life that era so that I can expose my many young family members to a time that I enjoyed so much.  A knowledge of history is absorbed as the children are entertained by these videos.  Most children did not know this 'world' existed  until they viewed these Ice Age videos.  I do hope there will be a sixth Ice Age video to add to my collection.

  Thank you, Amazon, for making this collection available.  And at a very reasonable price.  Louise Mustain  6-18-2014",1403049600,,1102,4.484848484848484

5974825,4,B00FC1ZC2S,"The geographically closest kid to me is about 3 years old, and these films are a little bit too sophisticated for her.  Plus she's still afraid to put on 3-D glasses, so she misses out on appreciating 3-D versions of films.  In addition as other reviewers noted, there are 2 or 3 very mild swearwords.  However for animated films, they are quite well done.  They're probably great entertainment for around age 5 to 10. and adults may enjoy watching along.  The four of these in a bundle is a great deal if you want movies that will entertain one or more kids in your house, or for a present---why not have it all?",1398816000,,613,4.389380530973451
