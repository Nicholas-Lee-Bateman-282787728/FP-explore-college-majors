2731520,3,B000MGBLT6,Overall it's a nice collection of some of Sam Jackson's films at an affordable price. Not HD or Blu-Ray quality but definitely wrth it if you just want the films.,1306627200,,162,4.433333333333334
2731521,3,B000MGBLT6,"At the time I bought this, the only thing I was interested in was Rules of Engagement - it was unavailable by itself. RoE is a decent movie. The others are gorp and I just scanned through them without spotting any cinematic triumphal moments.",1284076800,,242,4.5227272727272725
2731522,5,B000MGBLT6,"Samual Jackson is an amazing actor in every way.  He's so attractive too!
He will turn you on, impress you, and amaze you all at the same time in
so many ways from moment to moment.  He holds your attention with the
strong male characters that he so giftfully and artfully plays.  Get this
little set and you won't be disappointed, male or female!  Check it out!
