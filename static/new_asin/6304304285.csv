838345,5,6304304285,"It's a shame that not enough people seem to know about ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" based on Charles Dickens' novel.
The story centers on wealthy, old Martin Chuzzlewit (Paul Scofield). His many relatives believe that he is at death's door, so they swarm about him like a bees angling to get a piece of his fortune. He is estranged from his namesake and grandson, young Martin, and is accompanied about town by his young companion, Mary Graham. Chief among his many relatives is the hypocritical and fastidious Mr. Pecksniff (wonderfully portrayed by the versatile Tom Wilkinson - ""Full Monty,"" ""In the Bedroom"") and his daughters Charity (Emma Chambers) and Mercy (Julia Sawalha - ""AbFab"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"").  He invites young Chuzzlewit into his home only to banish him without explanation weeks later.  Young Martin has to fend for himself and leaves for America with his faithful helper Mark Tapley in search of fortune.
The cast is sold and strong - the round of colorful relatives and acquantances including the conniving and greedy Jonas Chuzzlewit, his father (and old Martin's twin) Anthony Chuzzlewit, the humble and sweet Tom Pinch, and the scoundrel Montague Tigg (Pete Postlethwaite). The story has everything you would expect from a Dickens novel - romance, tragedy, satire, good deeds rewarded and the bad guys getting their just desserts. The high production values are what you would expect from the BBC.
I highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, George Eliot or excellent British drama. If you enjoyed ""Our Mutual Friend"" or ""Middlemarch,"" check this one out. You won't be disappointed.",1045699200,46,1640,5.161654135338346
838346,5,6304304285,"There has recently been a rebirth of Dickens mini-series and I believe that this is one of the best. For some reason, Dickens is best known for his depressing stuff (a Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations) but Martin Chuzzlewit is a robust melodrama and it translates very well to the screen.
There are actually two Martins in this movie, Martin senior, the wealthy old man who is suspicious of everyone, and his grandson and namesake who Martin Sr. has disinherited. With the heir apparent out of the way, Martin Sr.'s money grubbing relations move in to try to get themselves a piece of the pie when the old man dies. The sneakiest and most odious of the lot is the hypocrytical Mr. Pecksniff. (Look closely, do you recognize the Dashwood sister's father from Sense and Sensibility?) He has a slimy scheme for getting at Martin Sr.'s money and plans to use Martin jr. for it.
That, in a nutshell is the plot for the first hour of the movie. Other subplots involve more of Mrtin Sr.'s relatives, the evil Jonas, the subliterate Chevy Slyme and his smooth tongued friend Tigg Montague and of course Pecksniff's daughters Mercy and Charity.
All I can say is that I admire the screenwriter's skill in bringing the bulky Dickens tome down to size. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book but I can see it would be difficult to make even a 5 hour mini-series out of it. They eliminate a few minor subplots and almsot all of the American adventure. (This is just as well, Dickens had visited America, hated it, and ranted about the fact through the mouths of his characters for several long passages in the book, very amusing but not the stuff TV drama is made of)
Anyone who has seen the original illustartions for the book will be delighted by the movie since the casting, costuming and hair styling is such that the actors look as if they have stepped out of the book. (Tom Pinch and Pecksniff are especially close)
A great deal of fun though it takes some time to get into it. My only complaint is that on the box there is a picture that gives away a key plot twist! This was very sloppy and ruined some of the movie for me. My advice, don't look at the box too closely before you pop the tape in if you still want some suprises.

There was some necessary pruning of Martin the younger's time in America which was a vast improvement, and it was easier keeping the important characters straight while watching than it was when reading.  There are lots of familiar faces: Emma Chambers from the Vicar of Dibley; Julia Sawahla from Lark Rise; Keith Allen from Robin Hood; Julian Fellowes from Downton Abbey; and others.",1433548800,,503,4.976190476190476

838817,4,6304304285,"I know other reviewers have pointed out valid reasons to give this production lower ratings.  It is not one of Dicken's more absorbing tales which in turn can cause the length of the story to drag.  However, my interest stems from watching such wonderful performances from such solid actors:  Paul Scofield and Elizabeth Spriggs are at the top of my list for creating characters of such wit and wicked charm.  I only advise purchasing this DVD if you truly enjoy other period pieces like BBC's Our Mutual Friend, The Way We Live Now, Pride and Prejudice, etc . . .",1411776000,,564,4.61
838818,3,6304304285,"This is a wonderful production, featuring a performance by Tom Wilkinson (as Pecksniff) that ranks with the best ever put to film/video in a Dickins story. I traded up from our VHS copy to this DVD looking forward to another enjoyable viewing. I had not noticed, when I bought it, that this product is a double-sided disc, always a bit dubious. Sure enough, the disc spluttered to a stop during the first episode and would not work thereafter. I tried it on another player and the same thing happened. (Alas, it was now outside the Amazon returns window!!!)

838902,5,6304304285,As with all things Dickens; This story was absolutely superb and this adaptation kept you wondering till the very last moment. Performances were rich and top notch by everyone in the cast. The characters were well developed and when all the pieces begin to come together it weaves into a powerful and clever ending. My husband and I are both big fans of Dickens and as such we are touchy on adaptations. We were not disappointed and would rate this as one of the top BBC productions.

My favorite character had to be Tom Wilkinson as Pecksniff-he is quite the creep and deceiver-but don't worry, it's Dickens-he'll get whats coming to him!

838977,5,6304304285,this book surpassed Bleak House which was my previous Dickens favorite. This plus the excellent movie provided many hours of family enjoyment and conversation.

But, I can't vouch for what shape your brain will be in after doing so -- fair chuzzlewitted, I would say.  Man, what a heap of verbage!  It's about 30-50 pages of roundabout Introduction, then Preface, then more ear chewing with the first chapter, and -- ah, at last I believe we're going to have a story here -- beginning with chapter 2.  Then there are the gross quantities of description, philosophizing and character analyses to be borne throughout.  Perhaps this is why it is a lesser known Dickens.  But, the scriptwriter(s) of this adaptation definitely mined the story and presented it quite worthily.  I hung on it, reveled in it and hurrahed over the usual Dickens even-handed squaring up at the end.  It's really, really good.  I count it now as one of my favorite Dickens stories.

I have only owned this film for a month but, I have already watched it several times and will continue to do so.

839099,5,6304304285,"Now and then we stumble upon a gem. This is it. Extraordinary performances, casting, direction, production, writing...the works.

I'm baffled that anyone can find fault in this fine work. Absolutely one of the best movies I've seen this life. Not having read the book, I can't say how true it is to it.

1. This particular story does not have likeable, interesting characters. (In most works of Dickens, the characters are incredibly unique and intriguing.  They draw the reader into their world.)

2. The actor playing the lead character, Martin Chuzzlewit, comes across the screen as incredibly boring.  I couldn't decide if the problem was the character being played or the actor himself, but, I found myself fast-forwarding quite often.

3. There were no redeeming set locations or supporting roles to make it worthwhile to watch.  The whole production was just one long and boring drama.

This Dickens' story is somewhat different from his other stories in that it ends on a happy note with none of your favorite characters dying or ending up in sad circumstances--which is prone to happen in most Dickens' stories. The characters are colorfull and well played by the actors. Paul Scofield does an excellent job playing Mr. Chuzzlewit. He actually plays a dual role, however, I will not disclose who it is. The story is very engaging and keeps you interested all the way through. Those who appreciate the true art of period BBC dramas will truly enjoy Martin Chuzzlewit.",1300924800,,743,4.858267716535433
839105,5,6304304285,"It takes Dickens to invent and explore such a sordid family history and story. For Dickens the world is cut into three types of people.

First the rich who are supposed to make money by all means, and of course first of all speculation. Madoff certified and a long time before that particular character appeared in finance. Dickens explores the greed of these people but also in some the sound sense of business and fairness, and yet always distorted by selfishness, since selfishness seems to be the main characteristic of man.

Second those who exploit the rich and they are of different types. The beggars or immoral servants, those who drink too much and reside in the petty crime of overbilling their services and taking advantage of an open door. These are luckily counterbalanced by those who are faithful, honest, hard working and ready to help those who deserve that help. Some are easily taken in and exploited again by some social climbing individuals.

Third the social climbers who consider all means are permitted to climb any step, or should I say rung, on the social ladder. They exploit the young, they steal their work and use it under their own names, they flatter the rich when they feel these are weak and gullible.

The best side of Dickens is that everyone will get the payment their deserve. The social climbers will be ruined by their own greed and the bigger greed of some other predators, when it is not plainly killed by one of their victims. The greedy rich will be the prey of all types of predators and those unworthy to be rich because totally overcome by their greed and unable to repent or simply be humble about it will die in the hands of worse characters of lower extract, including their own children. The faithful servants will be rewarded and happy in their hearts. The profiteering servants will be gently discarded.

Two themes are addressed besides these. The position of women in Victorian society. They are pure victims if they do not keep some distance and independence, the victims of men who take wives only to make a profit or to be presentable in society. But at the same time some can get free and keep free as soon as they are of age, provided they want to sever some ties that may hamper them or to refuse some attachments that may prove unwise. Strangely enough in this totally inhumane society women are a ray of sunshine when they believe in love and fight for it.

The second is America. Dickens had a special feud with the USA about his works being pillaged and looted by the American press without paying the royalties his copyright should have produced. Here again the American caper of Martin Chuzzlewit is a visit to a hellish and totally negative hallucination.

But if we look at the weddings in this story we find that ambiguous vision of Dickens: One marriage is a total failure, thet of Mercy with Jonas Chuzzlewit; two will be happy, the marriage of Mary with Martin Chuzzlewit and the marriage of Martin's self appointed servant with the housekeeper of the wicked profiteer Mr. Pecksniff. Two will never be fulfilled, that of Tom Pinch who was in love with Mary who chose Martin, and that of Charity whose paramour is taken away to Tasmania. Tom Pinch's sister will probably marry happily with Tom's friend. We are far from the four weddings of the Midsummer Night Dream by Shakespeare. Dickens' world sounds more like a Janus-like picture of a dream that covers up a nightmare.

This particular production by the BBC captures the slow and delicate rhythm of the original with quite a lot of details and side situations that give some depth to the main line of the story. This production also seems to emphasize the depiction of the monstrous and bleakest characters and even Old Martin Chuzzlewit, Martin's own grandfather, is not shown most of the time, and even at the end as a very palatable person. A beautiful piece of 19th century literature that will inspire some of the political minds of that century and the next. When you see such deep social rot the idea of a revolution becomes acceptable or even worth being desired.

839202,5,6304304285,"Dickens novels are replete with dialogue whereby, with pronunciation-spelling, linguistic quirks, and the expression of authentic feelings, the master is able to dilineate character and raise in the reader feelings of pity, sympathy, hatred, or any number of the more subtle emotions.  Adaptations of Dickens' novels have, therefore, most, if not all, of their dialogue ready-made for them.  The task for the script-writer and director is simply to select passages and to cast appropriately.  The BBC series of Dickens' novels is miraculously expert at preserving the spirit of the dialogue and casting people who are uncannily right for the characters.

The BBC adaptation of Martin Chuzzlewit, with Paul Scofied and Tom Wilkinson, among many many other capable actors, is no exception to the above.  Scofield plays the two Chuzzlewit brothers with seeming ease, separating one distinct personality from the other.  Wilkinson embodies the grasping, lecherous, hypocritically religious Pecksniff with commendable subtlety and restraint, making the character all the more despicable.  One could go on and on, citing one actor after another.  Suffice it to say that no one is miscast or fails to gives us what we might have heard and pictured when reading the novel.

By all means, read the novel first, for no dramatization, however expert, can capture Dickens' magnificent descriptive powers, which often reach Shakespearean heights.  However, after the long reads that Martin Chuzzlewit, or Barnaby Rudge, or Dombey and Son represent, you should not fail to enjoy the remarkable translations of these novels to the screen by the incomparable BBC.",1257120000,3,1647,5.448818897637795
839203,1,6304304285,"A story about relatives scheming for the inheritance of a wealthy old man who is about to die. That summarizes this film completely. Could be an interesting 2-minute scene, but not a 2-hour movie, much less this 6-hour movie.

Other than having no plot; this film is technically proficient in casting, acting, costumes, sets, lighting, and such. The dialogue is pleasant and constantly gives you the impression that something is about to happen, though nothing ever does for the entire 6-hours. Thus, it is possible to be led pleasantly along for the entire 6-hour film; after which, you are unwilling to admit you have been duped by the writer of other novels that were interesting, colorful, and entertaining; and so you write a glowing but unsupported 5-star review. Charles Dickens wrote some brilliant novels, but this is not one of them. This novel was unpopular when he wrote it, and has not been improved. My only other explanation for the 5-star reviews written mostly by women; is this is a chick-flick, and I am not a chick.

The fact that Charles Dickens despises the good American people of the 1800's in this novel; shows Mr. Dickens was of a confused mindset from the start, and gave rise to the phrase, ""You little Dickens"".

I recommend instead the better period films: 1994-version of Charles Dickens' ""Old Curiosity Shop"" with Peter Ustinov, or George Eliot's ""Silas Marner"", or: ""Middlemarch"", ""Wives and Daughters"", ""Under the Greenwood Tree"", ""North and South"", ""Oliver Twist"", ""A Christmas Carol-1951-version with Alistar Sim"", ""David Copperfield"", ""Bleak-House-1985-version"", ""Pride and Prejudice 1996 & 1940"", ""Wurthering Heights 1936"" (I haven't seen the other versions of ""Wurthering Heights"", ""Pollyanna 2004-version"", ""Nicholas Nickleby"", ""Road to Avonlea seasons 1-6"", ""Anne of Green Gables"", and ""Anne of Avonlea""",1254614400,8,1844,5.286689419795222

839306,5,6304304285,"In his commemorative book for the 1st 20 years of Masterpiece Theatre, Alistair Cooke commented that those who name ""Great Expectaions"" or ""Tale of Two Cities"" as their favorite Dickens novel are showing by their choice that they don't really care for Dickens. Often these more conventional, less eccentric novels are the ones most dramatized, and the public doesn't really get to know the crazy, dark, labrynthian world Dickens was capable of creating in his ""big novels""--like ""Old Curiosity Shop"", ""Little Dorrit"", ""Dombey & Son"", ""Our Mutual Friend"", and ""Martin Chuzzlewit"". It takes patience to read them, and great patience to render them faithfully on screen. I think that this performance does a remarkably good job of bringing the novel to life.

I had read the book beforehand, so had an idea of how the dramatization SHOULD be done, and was surprised and pleased to see it succeed so well  in many ways.

Pete Postlethwaite as Tigg Montague was (in my opinion) TRUE Dickens--eccentric in looks, manner, speech and not softened or blunted in any way. He conveyed the brash pungency of the character, as if an illustration by ""Phiz"" had come to life. Jonas Chuzzlewit is subtly depicted by Keith Allen.

**SPOILER FOLLOWS**

Oddly, this story reaches its excellent heights in death scenes. I think that's true in both novel and dramatizaton. The death of Anthony Chuzzlewit, a pivotal point in the novel, is almost frightening. And Jonas' suicide, short and sharp.

What characterizes Dickens is the interspersion of sharp, comic elements against dark social commentary. Sairy Gamp is wonderful, with her stuffed-up monologuing. I also liked Mary Graham, who was portrayed by Pauline Turner, not as an overtly beautiful girl, but as one with great sweetnes and warmth. One can easily understand people loving her, as everyone in the novel seems to do.

My ideal of Dickens dramatization was the long-ago Trevor Nunn production of Nicholas Nickleby, which starred Roger Rees. I always find it helpful in a review to know what the reviewer considers good, so this is my standard.

In any case, I'd highly recommend that you see this drama, if you appreciate what I'd call the ""bite of Dickens"".",1158710400,8,2202,5.03021978021978

After viewing this BBC presentation I concur with the previous glowing reviews.  This production of ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" is outstanding in every way.  Most of all the acting, by all involved, is stupendous.

Tom Wilkinson (of ""Full Monty"", ""Wilde"" and many more films), as the extremely pompadoured and very hypocritical Seth Pecksniff is unbelievably good.  I've seen Wilkinson in many films each time his performances are wonderful. His Seth Pecksniff is no exception-he is fantastic, as an outwardly solicitous man, but in reality, a very greasy opportunist-fantastic!  Keith Allen, as the extremely dastardly Jonas Chuzzlewit is also great playing one of Dickens' ""darkest"" villains with relish.  Paul Scofield, as the elder Martin Chuzzlewit is magnificent as a seemingly dotty old man; however in reality, he is a ""see all and know all"" wise old man.  I've named just a very few of the great actors in this presentation.  There are many many more.

As in many of Dickens' books there are many characters involved in many"" plot twists"" , unsavory happenings, reversal of fortunes, etc.  This BBC presentation has done a superb job of dramatizing and of bring this story to the screen.

To earn a living, so that he can marry Mary, younger Martin sets out to find his fortune in America--where it turns into a disaster and he nearly dies!

Besides the faithful adaptation of the storyline, every aspect of the characters appearance, the look of the different interiors etc., were in astounding accordance with the pictorial portrayals of the original and late 19 century, early 20th century illustrations. The unctuous, hypocritical Mr. Pecksniff with his unusual hairstyle was perfection, but the wonderful Philip Franks who portrayed the gullible but genuinely kind Thomas Pinch took the cake! I was so excited by the aesthetics of this depiction, that I had to look back on the illustrations, and there were a couple of Tom Pinch illustrations that looked exactly like Philip Franks portrayal! Well, to get back to the story line ( I let myself wander with excitement) the story is a very faithful depiction of the book, and is so very Dickensian in it's heavy, dark theme that is generous in light hearted, comic satire. Replete with renowned talent such as the late Paul Scofield, Tom Wilkinson, Philip Franks, John Mills, Julia Sawalha, Emma Chambers and last but not least the late Pete Postlethwaithe. Wonderful characterizations done with ease and naturalness. Julia Sawalha and Emma chambers are a sheer joy to watch in their roles as Cherry and Mercy Pecksniff the frivolous misdirected offspring of the repugnant Pecksniff. This movie is an absolute must watch for any Dickens lover, or for anyone who enjoys a truly good, well acted period piece besprinkled with refreshing whimsy.",1526169600,,1608,5.11787072243346

Would have given it 5 stars but it would need a heavier balance of lightheartedness for that
 Well acted & presented",1493683200,,352,4.253731343283582

7867599,5,6304304285,"I just listened to Frederick Davidson's superb reading of this novel and then, for a treat, watched the BBC treatment. What a joy to see the marvellous characters personified! While nothing can top an unabridged reading of a Dickens novel by a gifted British reader, certain aspects really benefitted from flesh and blood characterizations, such as Paul Scofield as the difficult twins. And I must also admit, being a girl, I really enjoyed seeing the precise type of outfits worn by the female characters. This was a masterful adaptation, calculated to delight the true Dickens connoisseur. I also agree with a previous reviewer that the American portions were best dispensed with. Not because anything Dickens was implying was wrong. It's all too true, even all this while later, but things truly bogged down there and the American characters, while realistic, were far, far from amusing.",1484784000,,890,5.144827586206897
