3273,3,0764000969,"I did this video for the second time to give it another chance, but to be honest I'm not all that crazy about it because I am still in the process of learning yoga & although the instructor Sara Ivanhoe is friendly & doesn't use confusing yoga terms I won't be using this again.  The ""downward dog"" pose is done way too much on this video & held for quite some time.  I had to get back down on my hands & knees since I had trouble holding the pose.  One good thing is that there is someone doing modified poses & another woman who is EXTREMELY flexible doing the more advanced poses.  My only favorite part was the end where you lie on your back on the floor & you take the time breathing as your body relaxes.  I personally LOVE Karen Voight's Streamline Fitness which is composed of 2 segments, the 1st consisting of a 25 minute workout with weights & the 2nd segment (30 minutes long) my absolute fave which consists of abdominal work which you WILL feel the next day, followed by a wonderful yoga segment.  You can choose to do both workout segments in one day or alternate.  Karen explains the poses so you're not trying to hold a pose & trying to look at the T.V. at the same time. Plus this is so easy to follow & this was the first video I attempted yoga with! I'd much rather stick to my Streamline fitness video.",992995200,2,1322,4.222222222222222
3274,5,0764000969,"I've had this tape for a little over a year, and I still reach for it quite often. The instructor is warm and friendly and explains how to get into each pose with percision. I always feel loose and relaxed after doing this workout. This is the tape that made me want to try even more yoga tapes to expand my practice! I recommend it to everyone I know just starting out. The price can't be beat and neither can the style. Although I have aquired more tapes recently, this tape will stay in my yoga practice for a long time to come!",980467200,,531,4.165048543689321
3275,4,0764000969,"I fondly imagined that this would be a gentle stretch to soothing music, so was rather challenged by quite a tough workout. One thing, do have a proper mat. My knees did not do well on a towel and I had to purchase a  good mat before I could repeat the workout. Further to other reviews, the  instructor's very affected speech patterns were annoying and distracting,  but not enough to take away from the fact that I will use this tape again  and again.",957744000,3,453,4.357142857142857
3276,2,0764000969,"I can't recommend this video!  There wasn't enought ""meat"" in this video to provide much of a yoga workout and the instruction needs improvement.  The instructor's voice and annoying cadence was enough to  make me toss the video.",951004800,3,229,4.973684210526316
7788399,5,0764000969,"I am definitely a yoga tape junkie (w/ 100 Yoga programs between VHS/DVD/CD) and 9 years of daily practice. I also take weekly classes with a fabulous teacher as well. I'm only mentioning this for the sake of background.

I like the variety that comes with getting to try different styles, sequences and instructors which video/DVD/CD programs provide. I had this on VHS for Years and recently bought the DVD w/ this program plus ""Fat Burning"" (which I also had on VHS).

 Before I go further in the review I definitely want to second the opinion that it's probably a good idea to start with something more basic if you are new to Yoga or haven't exercised in a while and feel out of shape. Yoga Zone ""Yoga Basics For Beginners"" and their ""Introduction to Power Yoga For Beginners"" (each has two twenty minute programs)are two programs I would work with before this one. They are excellent and enjoyable programs to get you started.

That being said :)

  I find Sara Ivanhoe to be a sound instructor who has put together a solid, balanced program. She is unintimidating, gives clear instruction and demonstrates very well. The students in the video also do a fine job as well. It's always nice to have a variety of people in a video like this because you get to see how different people will do the poses rather than feeling that there is only ""one way"" they should look. There is also a student who is designated to modify the poses to make them doable for most anyone in reasonable health.

 This program is a very reasonable length (under 40 minutes), yet long enough to be effective yet short enough to fit easily into one's schedule (especially since you can do it at home and don't need to spend time driving anywhere).

 It starts with ""Half Sun Salutes"" to warm you up before moving into a Standing Pose section which uses Down Dog as the home base. It is primarily warrior and lunge based movements (including extended side angle w/ your upper arm wrapped around your back and grabbing onto the forward leg's inner quadricep) plus a nice standing twist (which is called ""Straddle Fold Twist"" by Tracy Rich on the Total Yoga programs), which is basically a simpler version of a twisting triangle pose.

 There is a nice flow with Table/Balancing table (where you extend  the right arm/left leg and visa versa) which eventually adds pushups into the flow so you get your whole body really involved in this.

 Also included is a nice backbending section that is made up primarily  of locust variations and a flow including cobra.

 The program finishes off with some seated forward bends (including Janu Sirsasana-one leg forward bend w/ the other leg bent inward against the thigh) and lying twists before leading into a short relaxation segment.

 I may have left some things out here but that is the basic idea of what is contained in ""Joy Of Yoga"".

 I highly recommend getting the DVD version which contains this program plus the ""Fat Burning"" Yoga, which is an excellent program which has a flow that really creates heat in the body. The combined DVD is very inexpensive for the excellent programs contained in it.

Namaste",1071100800,,3136,4.680656934306569
7788400,4,0764000969,"The philosophy of all videos in the Crunch line is to make working out accessible to all people, regardless of size or experience.  The Joy of Yoga is no exception; it is a non-mystical yoga program taught in a very straightforward manner by instructor Sara Ivanhoe.  Ivanhoe's down-to-earth style (she frequently uses words like ""scooch"") is completely non-threatening and friendly.
Throughout this workout, Ivanhoe places a strong emphasis on breathing, with frequent reminders to inhale and exhale.  The practice begins with a focused breathing series involving forward bends and down dogs (there are many repetitions of this position) and then moves on to additional standing poses, including warrior, lunges, and twists.  The floor portion of the workout consists mostly of relaxing stretches, but there is one tough segment which alternates arm/leg stretches with yogi pushups.
Although Ivanhoe's overall cuing is good and she does include pointers on form, she does not provide full explanations of how to perform each pose; thus, this is not a workout for complete yoga novices.  However, beginners already familiar with the basic poses are likely to appreciate the modifications which are displayed as well as Ivanhoe's no-nonsense style.  Because this workout is also challenging at times, yoga practioners of all levels can benefit from using this tape as refresher to check both their form and especially their breathing.  Finally, at 35 minutes, this yoga practice is short enough for practically anyone to fit into their schedule.",1067299200,,1544,5.381742738589212
7788401,5,0764000969,"This video is great for breathing and relaxing.  If you are like me, I always carry tension in my neck/shoulders. At times, I can feel myself squeezing my shoulders to my ears.  This yoga video helps me to release tension because the instructor is always reminding us to breath, roll our shoulders back, and to let go...  Ahhhhh, it is a starting place!!!  This yoga routine is very basic and includes poses like the warrior and downward dog.  The main focus is on leg stretches so this would be a good video for a runner.
I gave the video 5 stars for the following reasons:
(1) Sara reminds you to breath--this is central to yoga.
(2) All poses are clearly demonstrated. The camera angles are great so you can see how the pose is suppose to be done correctly.
(3) Alternative poses are clearly demonstrated by another instructor. You actually get to *SEE* your options (other yoga videos will not always demonstrate these alternatives).  So you can go at your own pace and modify the program to suit your needs.
(4) Clocking in around 30 minutes, this video is quick and fairly easy so it is easy to incorporate into your daily schedule.
NOTE:  One of the reviewers complained that the instructor is patronizing and/or too friendly.  Sara has a very soothing tone, she speaks to remind you to breath and to explain how to position yourself correctly. She also smiles throughout the video--so she is not intimidating at all. I personally found her to be a great instructor because I felt like she wanted me to learn the proper techniques of yoga.  But you must decide if these attributes sound annoying to you.  I found her commentary helpful and sunny disposition motivating.",1053388800,5,1676,4.689419795221843
7788402,5,0764000969,"I think that this video was great.  Sara Ivanhoe, the instructor, has a very soothing voice. Her voice and the music in the background really helps me to relax.  This is my first yoga video.  I think that it is a good one because Sara gives you modifications if you are a first timer and you don't have the flexibility yet. I just ordered another one with Sara as the instructor.  She's great and so is this video!!!",1049760000,5,416,4.294871794871795
7788403,3,0764000969,"If this is not your first yoga tape, you'll find nothing new.  The poses are basic- downward facing dog, cobra, warrior 2, etc.  That said, the combination of poses is an effective stretching workout.
The instructor leaves a lot to be desired.  As noted in many other reviews, she talks incessantly.  What is most disturbing though is I constantly feel like she's laughing at me! It's not paranoia, she literally giggles through the whole workout.  ""This part should feel G-O-O-D!!"" she says, then adds a snort that implies ""Heheheheh...  suckers!""  Worse yet, she follows the laugh with a quasi-erotic moan and yet another giggle.  As soon as I learned the routine well enough, I hit the mute button and was pleased with a gentle routine for my slow, lazy days. It's certainly not the most challenging video you'll ever face, but decent for stretching exercises.",1048723200,4,863,4.903448275862069
7788404,1,0764000969,"I gave this one star to be polite, but I'm afraid my review isn't. I bought this tape when I first started learning yoga, and as a result almost dropped yoga altogether due to discouragement.  The people who made this tape are obviously into showing what THEY can do (an all-too-common problem with most exercise tapes, frankly), not teaching YOU how to do it properly.  I thought they were talented but smug--definitely not teacher material. I have had huge success learning yoga with the Yoga Zone tapes, starting with the Intro To Yoga tape and then moving through Flex.& Tone, Tot. Body Cond., and Cond.& Stress Relief, among others.  I also recommend Kripalu Yoga tapes.  Learning yoga is a wonderful thing.  The right instructors teach you patience and proper technique while you learn to be aware of your own strengths and limitations, and they help you learn you don't have to look or act like a startlet to accomplish these things.",1047168000,3,940,4.813664596273292
7788405,5,0764000969,"I've just purchased this in DVD format, which contains both the Joy of Yoga and Fat Burning Yoga both by Crunch (which I bought at [local store] for $$$).  This is my 1st purhase of a yoga video and I am totally addicted!  I only bought it a few days ago and have done the yoga everyday!  My five year old son loves to do it with me!  I used to be an aerobics instructor but over the years I have not exercised much mostly due to a knee injury.  This yoga is very appropriate to do if you have any kind of injuries that require no impact activity.  There is a lot of stretching and strengthening involved which is very good.  When you do this yoga, you can relax and enjoy it.  It is very easy for beginners.  However, watch out!  The next day you will be sore in places you forgot existed!  I very much recommend buying the Joy of Yoga (if you can get the DVD which contains both Crunch's Joy of Yoga and the Fat Burning Yoga too go for it).",1045440000,,942,4.037837837837838
7788406,5,0764000969,"This excersise tape is extremely good.  I just started doing Yoga and Pilates a couple of months ago, and really noticed a difference in my body within weeks.  The instructor is great, very motivational, and the workout leaves you feeling strong and energized.  The directions are easy to follow.  It also has alternative methods for beginners, but you'll find that by the third workout, you'll want more.  I'm someone who, after graduating from college five years ago, became too busy to work out.  When I first started doing the tape, I wasn't very flexible, which kind of frustrated me.  But within five workouts, I noticed I was already touching my feet, and the floor.  This workout is only about 35 minutes long, so it's easy to do in the morning before work, or at night when I get home.  It gives me time to cook afterward, clean up, and watch TV.  The best thing is that it's so much fun, you'll want to make time to do it.  I highly recommend it.",1027036800,4,956,4.5
7788407,4,0764000969,"When I bought this video I wanted something that would make me do some kind of exercise that wasn't too strenuous and that I could squeeze into my day easily.  I'd only tried yoga once, but the first time I did this I felt really relaxed at first and then--BOOM--I got this massive energy burst!  Maybe that's not just the video, it's just yoga in general but I was pumped.  So I get up early and do it a couple times a week before class.  It's great that it's only about 30 minutes or so (I was specifically looking for a workout about that long), making it easy to fit in, and it's not incredibly hard or tiring but there are still times when I find it difficult to hold poses (and I may be out of shape but I'm not THAT out of shape).  I also really like the cool down and relaxation bit at the end.  When I first went through it I thought, oh great, I'll fall back asleep on this part but it's still very active even though it's VERY calming and relaxing.  I'm not a yoga expert, but I love it, it suits my purposes perfectly--something short, stress-relieving, energizing, and a way to make myself exercise--and I want some more like it (any suggestions?)",1018051200,2,1160,4.269406392694064
