they arrived quickly and in great shape.",1358208000,,169,4.28125
4327965,4,B004CQZFEE,"I bought this Triple Feature 3-DVD Set containing Breaker! Breaker!, Hero and the Terror and Lone Wolf McQuade at Walmart for under five dollars at a Black Friday sale. Its been several years since I had seen any of Chuck Norris's movies, so I was excited about my purchase.

There is an error on the DVD cover jacket and the Breaker! Breaker! disc as it has the running time as 65 minutes when it is actually 95 minutes! Both Breaker! Breaker! and Hero and the Terror are on double-sided discs, one side being full screen and the other being widescreen. Lone Wolf is on a single disc.

Overall, I enjoyed re-watching the three films.",1355875200,5,634,4.552631578947368
4327966,5,B004CQZFEE,"In the new action movie The Expendables Chuck Norris says ""Sometimes you gotta run with the pack. Well it all started with Lone Wolf McQuade. An unconventional Texas Ranger. Sound familiar? Yes this led to Walker Texas Ranger. Only Mcquade is far more OUT THERE! Every Walker fan has to get this DVD. For Star Trek Voyager fans Robert Beltran co-stars. And the tough Ranger Captain is great character actor R.G. Armstrong. And if that's not enough you get 2 BONUS Chuck Norris movies. All for the price of 1 DVD. And another Chuck Norris sleeper is Silent Rage. A killer that Chuck's martial art skills can't kill. Sort of like Walker meets Jason.",1355529600,,647,4.684210526315789
4327967,4,B004CQZFEE,"OK. I am a schmuck for Mr. Norris. His movies are not brain candy. His are more the ""I have had a REALLY bad day at the office and need to kick some a**"" type of movie. He is graceful and deadly in his chosen field. There is little cursing and that usully tags someone as a bad guy of some sort. Rarely does Mr. Norris swear himself. You can generally tell where he is in his career by his facial hair...lol. The one thing you get from his movies is that evil does not triumph over good...regardless of the colour of their clothing!",1341532800,3,532,4.125

4327996,5,B004CQZFEE,great,1410652800,,5,5.0
4327997,5,B004CQZFEE,Chuck Norris is the best and my favorite action film star and all 3 movies are excellent but the best movie on this DVD is the 1983 movie of Lone Wolf McQuade and the character McQuade is the greatest Texas Ranger that there ever was and when you're in Texas look behind you because that's where the Ranger is going to be. David Caradine was great as a bad guy and Lone Wolf McQuade looks alot like the later TV series yhat Chuck Norris starred in on the CBS television network and that was his first television series and it was Walker: Texas Ranger that ran for 8 years and a series spinoff that he also starred in from time to time that ran for only one short season and it was the series Sons Of Thunder. You also get to see the first American movie that he starred in as the leading actor and that was the 1974 movie of Breaker! Breaker! and that movie I won tickets to see that movie back when I was only 3 years old and Breaker! Breaker! was the first hit film for Chuck Norris and his first Starring movie role in an American big screen film. The Hero and The Terror was Great also but alot different in that in this movie he is a married cop of which his wife is just about to have their first child to be born. Chuck Norris has trained very many Hollywood action film stars for the movies and television from Steve McQueen to Jean Claude Van Damme and has also created his own form of martial arts just as Bruce Lee has done with his own form of Kung Fu.,1410307200,,1464,4.1223776223776225

4328006,5,B004CQZFEE,"Chuck Norris was one of my favorite childhood actors, and watching these movies really took me back in time for a few hours. Don't expect to see acting that can rival Tom Hanks or choreographed fight scenes from a Jason Statham movie but, if you want nostalgia, these are the way to go.",1369267200,,286,4.415094339622642
