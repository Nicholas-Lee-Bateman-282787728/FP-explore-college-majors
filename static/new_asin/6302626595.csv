7828154,5,6302626595,Product was exactly as described. Excellent quality for such an old recording (1992).,1418256000,,85,5.615384615384615
7828155,5,6302626595,"I remember the first time I saw Chicago in concert, in the late '60s, as a warm-up band for a now long-forgotten ""star attraction""; they were wearing funny looking red toreador jackets, but amazed the audience with their brilliance and innovative music. Though Peter Cetera is missed, and especially my favorite original member, Terry Kath, who was tragically killed in a firearm accident in 1978, the two members who replace them in this tape are fabulous in their own right. Jason Scheff does Peter's parts wonderfully, and Dawayne Bailey plays guitar instead of Terry. Dawayne is absolutely riveting to watch, and awesome to listen to. The other founding member not in this line-up is Danny Seraphine.
Interspersed between the songs are short interview snips, giving some background to the material with Robert, Jimmy, Walt and Jason. The concert was taped live in 1992 at Pine Knob in Detroit, and the sound is good...much better than the average concert tape.
Outstanding numbers are ""Stay the Night"", a marvelous, jazzy ""Just You 'N' Me"", and an all-out finish with ""25 or 6 to 4"". Total running time is 1 hour.
Original band members are: Robert Lamm, keyboards, vocals, principal songwriter / Jimmy Pankow, trombone, songwriter / Lee Loughnane, trumpet / Walt Parazaider, woodwinds.
New members: Dawayne Bailey, guitar / Jason Scheff, bass, vocals / Bill Champlin, keyboards, guitar, vocals / Tris Imboden, drums.

7828156,5,6302626595,"Hard Habit To Break, Chicago is in the top of live performances. This video is one you will visit often. For the fans, for the kids, for those who have yet to score a front row seat. Don't get too comfy on the sofa though, cause you'll be up on your feet. Get this video, you'll be happy you did !!!",1029715200,4,299,3.918032786885246
7828157,1,6302626595,"Yes, the band played on, but with 4 members of the 8 not there, and most of the music that made Chicago, replaced with love ballad after love ballad mush, what's the reason to call this Chicago? Yes, it's a perfectly good band playing good average AOR, but unless you are very young and joined them after the first 11 albums, you'll know that the original band DID NOT play on. This is just survival stuff, and good for them too. May they always play and make a living, as I love them dearly. But Chicago-music compared to its best? To remember what they are capable of, and watch what they actually have become now, is very sad. To gloss over everything with a blanket praise of everything good and bad, will neither serve the audience, nor the band themselves who could do with some realistic feedback. So yeh, if you have never seen them, this is worth a look, but if you remember what they set out to be, then forget this.",1029283200,5,926,4.358381502890174
7828158,5,6302626595,"Why is it that everybody wants to hear all their favorite bands from the 70's & 80's - and insists that they have all the original members, that they all look and sound exactly like they did 20 years ago?  Do YOU look and sound like you did in 1980?  If so, please let me know what brand of embalming fluid they used!
People watch the Yankees, don't they?  Why?  Cuz they're a good team.  It doesn't matter that DiMaggio, Mantle and Ruth are all dead.",1002067200,6,451,4.1976744186046515
7828159,3,6302626595,"Even a hard core Chicago fan like myself has to sadly admit that this is not a great video. The band performed flawlesly (exept a couple out of pitch notes by the brass), and I think the interviews were great, not even Lee missing as a trumptet player bothered me. Why then I say is not a great video? Because the sound mix stinks! I don't know who mixed the audio for this video, but Chicago colud ask for their money back.  Odly balanced vocals and poorly mixed music takes all the magic away. If I were to have it my way, I'll take the interviews and the cool edit they made on ""Does Anybody Really Knows What Time It Is?"" and transfer it to the Chicago At The Greek Theatre video where the sound mixing was very well done. And thats all I have to say about that.",977011200,4,766,4.140939597315437
7828160,5,6302626595,"And the band played on is a prime example of an incredible rock band at their finest.  Chicago shines in this live video with short but nicely done interviews with various members.  Even though one of the brass players is  missing, it still shines and I highly reccommend it!",932515200,2,275,4.571428571428571
