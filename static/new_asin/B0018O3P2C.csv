3418079,5,B0018O3P2C,"My grandchildren love Corduroy on an old video.  They like it better than to read the story, it is so alive for them.  It is truly a favorite of theirs along with Mike Mulligan and the Steam Shovel.  We appreciate the scholastic dvd's to watch together after we have read the books over and over.",1230681600,4,296,4.345454545454546
8270375,5,B0018O3P2C,I loved this film when I saw it years ago and I knew my grandson would enjoy it as well.  He is 3 years old and his brother just turned a year old.  They both enjoy watching it over and over again.  Even the one year old will sit and watch it in it's entirety.  This is a superb film.  I wish there were more like it.  I highly recommend it.  Well done.,1474329600,,353,3.7534246575342465

8270377,5,B0018O3P2C,"All of my granddaughters have loved this movie - the 3 in one family refused to give theirs up for their new cousin - so, this purchase puts a copy in my son's home for his little girl. We all just love Corduroy!",1388707200,,212,3.953488372093023
8270378,4,B0018O3P2C,"I bought the dvd for the Cordurory story, both my son and his father enjoy the books.  My son who is five asks to watch it on a regular basis, but we have never made it through the entire dvd it just does not hold his attention past Cordurory and the steam shovel story that come on after.  One thing I did not like was that the book does not 100 % follow along with the Cordurory books.  I often got statements of ""this isn't in the book"" or ""this is not in the movie."" I would recommend it, if for nothing more than Cordurory, it gets a lot of play time in our house.",1364947200,,569,3.9304347826086956
8270379,3,B0018O3P2C,"If you are looking for an illustrated/animated version of Corduroy, this is not it.

I bought this DVD because my toddler loves all things Corduroy.  We already had the Scholastic Storybook Treasures DVD of A Pocket For Corduroy, which she could watch all day if I let her, and I thought this would be a good alternative.  But my daughter won't watch it because a) it is live-action and b) it does not follow the original story.  The premise is the same and as an adult I can tell that it is basically the same story.  But to my daughter, the giant bear who looks vaguely like Corduroy and crawls through a train tunnel is not actually Corduroy.",1320451200,,645,4.432203389830509
8270380,5,B0018O3P2C,"Most of these videos are just old 70's book follow-a-longs. If you were around back then you know the kind of slide-style presentations and very simple animation styles we had back then. Very nostalgic. The kids of today may not like it, but I did not purchase this for kids. I wanted a copy of the ""Happy Owls"" story that is in this DVD, which is a charming story about appreciating life for all the beauty it offers rather than squabbling over the petty daily activities.

It's simple, and dirt cheap. I got far more than I paid for as far as I am concerned, however I have realistic expectations about 70's video because I was around at the time. If you have never seen the animations of the 70's, you may want to research before buying.",1306022400,,740,4.401459854014599
8270381,5,B0018O3P2C,"This is a wonderful adaptation of the book by the same name and is an excellent video for children from pre=school on up to 2nd grade.  The pictures and the author's own words are depicted on this  dvd.  My grandson who is only 2 years old, enjoyed the story bcause of his love of animals and the main character which was a teddy bear.",1273449600,,335,4.203125
8270382,3,B0018O3P2C,"There is only one short video about Corduroy on this DVD, the other stories are just still pictures of pages in various storybooks; kids won't watch it.",1262822400,8,152,4.666666666666667
8270383,4,B0018O3P2C,"I'm surprised no one mentioned that the Corduroy story is the only one that is not a cartoon. I thought it was very well cast and well presented with real actors in a real department store, but would have preferred the story cartoon version. The story was also changed a bit, thought the plot stayed the same. Otherwise all the other stories are excellent. As a teacher, I love that these storybooks were made into videos!",1262476800,8,422,4.565789473684211
8270384,5,B0018O3P2C,Bought this for my 3 year old son who has a stuffed bear he calls Corduroy.  He and his 5 year old brother really liked the video.  They especially liked the Corduroy and Mike Mulligan stories.  I found the Corduroy segment to be especially sweet.  This is not one of those videos they want to watch every day (like Fireman Sam which was a gift at the same time) but (maybe that is a good thing) when they do watch it they enjoy it and I can feel good about what they are watching.,1241654400,2,481,4.085106382978723
