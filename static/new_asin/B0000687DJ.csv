If you unwisely elect to watch ""Doctor Dracula"" prepare to snooze through most of it, which is actually the best way to deal with it. It's a wretched film from Adamson originally titled ""Lucifer's Women"" in 1975, but Al couldn't leave well enough alone and added more even sillier footage in 1981 to give us this film, which is stunningly plodding for a movie with so much going on.

The movie is both pretentious and confusing (no surprise given its production process) but centers on magician Wainwright (Larry Hankin) who is actually the reincarnation of Svengali. The movie opens with some ludicrous exposition that attempts to set up the plot, and immediately follows with Svengali sawing a woman in two. This may sound interesting enough, but the real star of the show is Svengali's beard, which never ceased to make me laugh. The film is edited very oddly, with numerous plot distractions such as another magician (Bobo, the mute magician in pancake makeup with his helpful sidekick ""The Beautiful Butterfly!"") None of this furthers the story, which slowly comes around to a power struggle between the vampire faction led by Dr. Gregorio (the reincarnation of Dracula, played by Geoffrey Land) and the nutty occultist faction led by the always cheery John Carradine as Radcliff. John looks so bored and confused by the proceedings that I expected him to lapse into a nap at any moment.

Radcliff provides some extremely confusing background information about the tiki torches at Stonehenge, and generally introduces a lot of witchcraft nonsense. There's a subplot about a daughter looking for her mother (which leads to a bizarre love triangle I'd rather not get into,) vampires, mentalists, ugly clothes, and really ugly wallpaper lurking around every bend waiting to be deployed in the story, though it doesn't fit together very effectively. (Who knew the lair of the occult had such cheerful sunflower wallpaper?) There are just loads of howlingly bad dialogue and psychobabble: Wainwright needs an ""aggressive incorporation of a new psychic energy source."" That source turns out to be Trilby (the lovely Jane Brunel-Cohen, who is the sole sympathetic character in the film,) but there's a problem: Wainwright is in love with her and is trying to ""re-emerge"" out of Svengali. Seriously. Take this figuratively or literally, but later in the film you'll see why the latter is more appropriate. Why Trilby? Because ""she has a beautiful soul"" (and she's a professional dancer.) After tons of reincarnation nonsense that just goes on and on, there's some goat head imagery, a bit of ritualistic nonsense, and some more fiendishly bad dialogue (""This child needs treatment that only the purest magic can provide!"", and ""Murder is a very hard term to define..."") after which we learn that vampires like to listen to country music in their car and that Trilby is ""an eternal energy source,"" which is why everyone is trying to get her.

Fortunately, after a scholarly explanation of deja vu (note the lovely monkey lamp,) the real three-way power struggle gets underway (finally!) at Radcliff's place in a trying conclusion that leads directly to perhaps John Carradine's single hammiest line ever (""You will perish with us!"") I will not reveal the outcome of the film, other than to say it's quick and ridiculous, which is the best you could possibly hope for under the circumstances.

The DVD has a few extras, including various trailers. Most interestingly, the trailer for ""Lucifer's Women"" is presented. It appears to be a more lucid film, and definitely reveals more about the characters than is obvious from the final cut of ""Doctor Dracula,"" for which there is no trailer presented. Despite the presence of John Carradine and Al Adamson the film stinks. (It's hard to believe, I know.) Best in their roles are Larry Hankin and Jane Brunel-Cohen, while Carradine and Land are simply excruciating to watch. Even Vic Kirk as Bobo and Niki Zachmanoclou as a victim couldn't save this film. This transfer has abundant audio hiss, and a violin and synthesizer soundtrack that made me want to climb the walls to get away, among numerous other drawbacks. Even as a devoted fan of B-movies, this one was tough. It is one of John Carradine's worst, and may well be Al Adamson's very worst. I advise keeping your distance.",1331337600,,4484,4.974666666666667

The characters are unconvincing, the story is rather ridiculous, any effects are unbeivable, and those are the good points.

Adamson was never a good director but I've always found his efforts watchable if not entertaining, such as SATAN'S SADISTS. The best thing I can say about this time-waster is if it were a fish it would still stink on ice.",1309305600,,426,4.743243243243243
7963746,3,B0000687DJ,This is not the best 70's horror film. But it's good for a one time watch. I think it's best to rent it before buying.,1208131200,,118,3.76
