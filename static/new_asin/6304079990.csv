Well, if you have a good screen play, great actors, knowledge of film making, a bit of luck and some talent, you may succeed. This film had it all and that is why it came out just fine. Of cause there were a few shortcommings but they were so little that I did not care about them. I liked the film in general and everything about it so much that I thought that the shortcommings just gave it a little extra flavor.

781026,5,6304079990,"Firstly I would say that if you have in your library John Mackenzie's THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY, also available in the Criterion collection, and Neil Jordan's MONA LISA, you already have a good specimen of what the British cinema was able to offer in the eighties. A fabulous actor, Bob Hoskins, is present in both movies; he won the best actor prize at the 1986 Cannes Festival for MONA LISA.
Neil Jordan began his career as a writer and is, in my opinion, one of the most interesting film directors nowadays. It's always challenging for the common viewer to watch a movie directed by a former writer. One often wonders why the director has left his books for the cinema. Some of these ex-writers use the camera as if they were handling a pen and the result is dreadful. Or too intellectual. Fortunately, with MONA LISA, Neil Jordan has created a stunning visual world and George and Simone's night wanderings through the London underworld an unforgettable cinematographic journey.
MONA LISA develops a lot of themes that will touch you in a way or in another. The different levels of the movie are so well mingled in the story that you will be able to watch MONA LISA several times and still discover little pearls hidden by the brilliant director. At the end of the movie, I just wanted to check the sound quality of the commentary track recorded in 1996 by Neil Jordan and Bob Hoskins and I found myself trapped into MONA LISA for an immediate second screening.
Apart from the commentary, this Criterion DVD offers the theatrical trailer and a one page written Neil Jordan commentary.

781027,5,6304079990,"I believe Neil Jordan put together a work of perfection here. I deeply cared for the two main characters (played brilliantly by Hoskins and Tyson). The portrayal of the pain of isolation and the hopelessness of not  being able to connect with their desires touched me at a level only great  works can do. All the details of a film are done with perfection.(Don't  forget the fine little performance of Robbie Coltrane who later became the  main charater in ""Cracker"".)

The  Hoskins character is remarkably naive, falls in love with the prostitute  and tries to protect her, and disaster ensues.
There's an unforgettable  moment, when they're both in tears, hiding behind silly plastic eyeglasses  in a garish carnival setting, and, trying to explain her odd situation that  he's just beginning to understand, she says, ""Haven't you ever needed  someone?"" and he squeezes out the reply: ""All the  time.""
It's a remarkably tender story in a chokingly ugly  environment. Caine is gruesomely sleazy.
I remember seeing this when it  first came out, about the time of ""Blue Velvet"" and  ""Brazil""; what an amazing era that was! All three movies even had  ironically sweet or upbeat theme songs from a few decades  before.
Director Neil Jordan later moved on to the weirder pastures of  ""The Crying Game,"" and then the glossy jobs ""Interview with  the Vampire"" and now ""The End of the Affair,"" but I still  consider this his best -- not to mention Bob Hoskins's most incredible  acting work.",948672000,22,1220,4.935960591133005

But further, he can sacrifice himself to help the prostitute find a teenage prostitute she loves and wants to rescue her despite the hopeless prison of drugs and tricks.

781084,5,6304079990,"Mona Lisa (Neil Jordan, 1986)

I watched Mona Lisa towards the end of December, after I had set the first draft of my Best I Saw list for 2013. When I was finished, I immediately went to that list and had to rearrange it. Neil Jordan took the British gangster film (and he was serious about making sure people knew it was a British gangster film, to the point of casting the British gangster film stalwart, Bob Hoskins, the Ray Winstone of the eighties), added some of that Neil Jordan magic that few people recognized that early in his career (Mona Lisa was Jordan's third feature), and came up with something that simultaneously revelled in being a British gangster film and something that was also totally new. I'm not sure there is such a thing as the definitive British gangster film, and if it does exist, I'm certain it happened well before 1986. Besides, Mona Lisa breaks far too many molds to be a definitive anything... and yet, somehow, it is, a quick, genre-bending, exceptionally intelligent piece of work.

George (Hoskins) is a small-time mobster who has just been released from prison for a crime he didn't commithe took a fall for his boss, Mortwell (Michael Caine), who's now avoiding him. He tries to pick up a bit of make-work until he gets back in good with his old mob, and Mortwell, through a proxy, throws him a bone as the driver for a high-class courtesan, Simone (The Serpent and the Rainbow's Cathy Tyson in her feature debut). The two of them have some rough edges to get through, but eventually end up bonding. Once that occurs, Simone asks George for a favorshe promised a fellow courtesan that she would look after her, and the two of them have lost touch over the years. Could George find her? And thus, the mobster becomes an amateur detective, leading to a sequence that's equal parts comedy and homage to Taxi Driver.

See what I mean about genre-bending? That's a tough thing to do, and the more movie I watch the more I understand how tough it is, but Jordan handles everything he tries here with aplomb. Every decision here was made correctly, from casting to camera angles, with one arguable exception (it is obvious, given that a section of the film is a full-length rendition of the Genesis song In Too Deep over a montage of George doing his sleuthing, that the studio paid highly for the song and damned well meant to fully showcase it). It is perhaps not a perfect film, but if it is not, is is about as close to one as I have seen in quite a while; this is fabulous filmmaking, and it doesn't matter what genre you are most into, you are likely to find a bit of it here; this is a movie that by rights should have appeal to the widest swath of filmgoers of any I have seen in many years. **** ",1391126400,,2739,4.472

It's a story that meets the viewer right at eye level and without any kind of pretension. A story that just seems odd enough to be believeable because it's some of us, most of us, all of us in one way or another. I know the story is told a thousand times in every culture which is what makes this particular love story so compelling. Everyone has been in love and everyone whose ever been in love has felt used and abused at some time or another. There's not a lot of action in the classic sense, but the real story is in the relationship between people. Did I like it. Honestly, I think I've seen this movie three or four times and I'm never dissapointed in the viewing. If you have to have explosions and high wire thrills, this is not your movie. But if you're want to see a reflection on how we act, how we get damaged and how we heal, check this movie out.

781130,5,6304079990,"I first saw this film alone in a theater years ago when I had an afternoon off. I can still remember how its disturbing images haunted me for days after. It shows the dehumanizing, emotionally disconnected underworld of London prostitution. Bob Hoskins portrays a good-hearted loser, just released from prison. Usually loveable Michael Caine is simply hateful as a sleazy mobster who gives Hoskins a job chauffeuring an elegant call girl (Cathy Tyson). While driving her to her assignations, Hoskins naively falls in love with her. He wants to protect her and feels jealous as he waits for her trysts to end. Predictably, his amateur love is unrequited - she's a professional who has lost the capacity to feel romantic love.  She does, however, have an obsession; to locate and save a drug-addicted young girl who is also being sexually exploited by Caine's character. Like a knight on a quest, Hoskins sets out to locate the girl. In his search he visits the creepy haunts of young women enslaved in drug-dependent prostitution. His quest is successful, but sadly, his love is not returned. In the end though he is really the only winner; he has a heart and still knows how to love.

781132,5,6304079990,"A beautiful film that just rests so easily on the audience, `Mona Lisa' delivers a major wallop without ever overdoing it, as so many other movies tend to do.  There are respectable nuances that run through this film, helping elevate it with mere subtlety.  From the intimate direction (so tender when needed) to the flawless performances (from the mysterious to the nave to the downright dastardly) to the clever script that allows the characters to blossom with realistically devastated effect, giving us tension in dramatics without overselling it or taking us out of the film itself, `Mona Lisa' has everything.

The film centers around a nave ex-con named George.  Having trouble acclimating back into the real world (that world being the London crime scene), George is given a job by his old boss; driving a pretty `escort' around town.  Initially chilly and unresponsive, this young lady (her name being Simone) becomes rather trusting of George.  Despite being a thug, he's slightly dim-witted and obviously big hearted and so she sees a way to infiltrate his layers and use him to her advantage.  That advantage unravels a giant web of filth that George was not prepared for.

Some have mentioned how George was almost too nave for a thug who just got out of the pen, but in all honesty, George served an elongated stint behind bars and upon his release, the world he knew was a much different place.  Besides, when considering his position (chauffer) of use, it wouldn't be too farfetched to conclude that George was never let-in on the secrets behind his own profession.

I mean, he's still left in the dark even now.

The film really comes together beautifully upon its tragic and explosive conclusion.  It weaves a tangled web of lies, deceit, smut and love that all come to a head in the final frames.  Neil Jordon (the films writer and director) has a real knack for creating human stories that revolve around illogical love.  Just a quick glance at his most acclaimed film (`The Crying Game') as well as his most recent (`Ondine') and one sees such richly developed stories about love in the most uncommon and unnatural of situations.  `Mona Lisa' is no different, and when all is said and done it is the love story that remains the film's core driving point.  The relationship that develops between George, a man trying desperately to emotionally contend with his own familial situation, and Simone, a reclusive call girl with a dark secret of her own, is so richly developed, using subtle shifts in tone and speech to take us in without divulging too much.

And yes, I love Paul Newman (possibly my favorite actor of all time), but Bob Hoskins should have walked away with that Oscar; hands down!  What he does with George is masterful.  He layers George with so many related yet conflicting emotions, it is truly stunning to watch.  Cathy Tyson is also superb, chipping away at her chilly persona to deliver heartbreaking emotions in the final moments.  And yes, Michael Caine (who won the Oscar that year for his work in `Hannah and Her Sisters') is also extremely effective as the slimy Mortwell.

With charm, class and seedy authenticity, `Mona Lisa' is a true work of art!",1310601600,2,3195,4.813186813186813

The movie is wonderful from start to finish with outstanding performances by Bob Hoskins, Cathy Tyson and of course the great Robbie Coltrane. The supporting cast is first rate and the direction by Neil Jordan is, as one would expect, terrific. Some of the themes are reminicent of those in Jordan's ""The Crying Game"".  However, this is a much better film that realistically portrays the slimy, dirty and explotive world of illegal prostitution from the Call Girl to the sexually abused young girl. The film revolves around the relationship between a prostitute (Ms Tyson) and her driver(Hoskins) a relationship that goes from distain and animosity to an interesting  kind of friendship, understanding and love.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough. The Blu Ray version is another matter. While mostly OK the darker scenes, which are many, leave much to be desired.  The dark colors are extremely grainy and at times fuzy and distracting.  I would recommend the Standard DVD over this Blu Ray version.",1285459200,11,1172,4.782178217821782

781136,5,6304079990,"One thing you do not expect from a crime thriller is a tender heart at the center.  George(Bob Hoskins), after doing a seven year stretch for the crime boss Mortwell(Michael Caine) is given a job chauffeuring Simone(Cathy Tyson), a high priced call girl, to her assignments.  At first there is mutual distaste for one another followed by a grudging respect.  Simone eventually feels a level of safety with George that she requests a favor of him.  It's from that point in the film that George developes a fascination that borders on love for Simone.  Make, no mistake about it.  This is not ""Never on Sunday"" or ""Pretty Woman"".  This is a no-holds-barred examination of the prostitution and porn industry.  George serves as the audience's conduit to this netherworld of vice.  Despite George's exterior toughness lies a certain naivete as well as a sweet nature.  A scene that most demonstrates this is when George breaks down emotionally to Simone at a seaside resort sporting novelty sunglasses and professing his love for her after a perceived betrayal.  Hoskins is no less than brilliant in expanding on his tough guy persona that he assayed so well in ""The Long Good Friday"".  Tyson falls in the classic femme fatale mode reminiscent of Lana Turner or Lauren Bacall.  Caine is scarifying good here making you stand on edge in the few scenes he appears in.  Also good in an abbreviated appearance is Sammi Davis as a teenaged prostitute.  ""Mona Lisa"" is intricately plotted with surprises at every corner.  Discretion forbids me from giving away key plot points but this movie would make a terrific double-bill with director Neil Jordan's ""The Crying Game'.

However it looked so good that I tried again the next evening and got through almost half of it.  I could tell that the acting was first rate and I wanted to stick it out.  When George, the hero went to sleeze joints and houses of prostitution to find Cathy for his friend, I found it too hard to take.  I just wasn't in the mood to see 15 year old girls with bruises on their faces turning tricks for slimy pimps.  Too depressing.

Perhaps if I could have understood more of the dialogue I would have made it through that rough spot.  Reading the reviews here makes me want to have seen it. I'm not really reviewing the film here.  I just wanted to warn others who may have a similar hard time with English films.

781191,4,6304079990,"Upon its 1986 release, ""Mona Lisa"" was proclaimed a masterpiece of the British crime film drama; it brought the Irish-born Neil Jordan, who'd both written and directed it, to the forefront of working British film directors.  Reminded everyone of Nat King Cole's great song.  Won its star Bob Hoskins an Academy Award nomination, as well as the Cannes Film Festival and British Academy Awards.  It's since been recognized as one of the big three of British noir crime dramas: Michael Caine made ""Get Carter,"" Hoskins made ""The Long Good Friday;"" together, they made ""Mona Lisa.""

The movie has frequently been compared to Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver,"" for many reasons.  Hoskins stars as George, typical, low-wattage East End thug, just getting out of jail after doing seven years for crime boss Mortwell (Caine).  George thinks he's owed; Caine gives him a job chauffeuring high priced hooker Simone (Cathy Tyson).  Hoskins is expert, as ever, in conveying the controlled violence in George's soul; he also conveys as well as possible the character's surprising naivete.  Caine is the cool, even-tempered, joking, fierce villain we saw in ""Get Carter;"" there's a ten-second bit where he allows Mortwell's mask to slip; we see him with bared teeth, closing in for the kill.  Tyson, on her way to a television career, does a good job as Simone, with her own problems.  The young Sammi Davis, best known for ""Hope and Glory,' stands out as an exploited young drug-addicted prostitute.  And the economy-sized Scots comic Robbie Coltrane, before his television success as ""Cracker,"" seems wasted in a pointless subplot, as George's best friend.

Still, to me, the most apt comparison to this movie is actually the movie of John Steinbeck's ""Of Mice and Men.""  We have Coltrane, as Hoskin's friend, often asking him to ""Tell me a story, George.""  That's a direct quote from Lenny (Lon Chaney Jr.)'s frequent request to his George, Burgess Meredith.  And we have cockney George buying a rabbit for Mortwell, we're never told why, but Lenny had a pet rabbit in ""Of Mice and Men.""  However, on a first viewing after several years, what was most striking to me about this film was how mannered the script is, how careful to alternate dramatic highs and lows.  And how unlikely it is that Hoskins' character could be quite so naive, after an adult life spent the shady side of the law, and a seven-year jail stint.

The seamy London underworld of homelessness, drugs, and kinky sex is well-captured in this movie; the powerful photography gives us the feel of some of the city's meanest inhabitants and streets.

Otherwise, this movie builds upon another of Jordan's signature themes: the love of a man for an inappropriate woman.  George is evidently greatly mistaken in believing that a character as damaged as Simone can be talked into a future of love, marriage, and a baby carriage.  The same theme pops immediately to mind in at least the eight other feature films, that Jordan wrote, and/or directed, that I've seen.  Many viewers will be familiar with the recent ""Breakfast on Pluto.""  Liam Neeson, an Irish parish priest, fathers a child upon his housekeeper, whom he actually loves.  In ""The End of the Affair,"" Ralph Fiennes tries to continue seeing Julianne Moore, but she's sworn off him, in a prayer to God to save his life during the London blitz.  In ""Interview with the Vampire,"" the seven-year old vampire played by Kirsten Dunst, will never, in all eternity, be mature enough for Tom Cruise's undead character.  In ""The Crying Game,""well, the transvestite Dil will never be the woman Fergus thought she was.  Then there's ""The Good Thief:"" Nick Nolte's old enough to be a grandfather to that movie's teenage prostitute.  In ""We're No Angels,"" Robert De Niro, masquerading as a priest, is flummoxed by Demi Moore's Molly.  And ""The Miracle,"" an adopted Irish teenager unknowingly falls in love with his biological, and fully-aware, mother.  And then there's ""High Spirits,"" Peter O'Toole at his least disciplined, a silly little haunted castle movie.  Poor Steve Guttenberg finds himself in love with a ghost in that one.  So what's a feller to do?",1171756800,7,4158,4.963872832369942

I can't add much to what others have already pointed out.  How does an actor portray a not too bright, tough, small time hood who has a big heart?  It could not have been an easy thing to do, but Hoskins did it brilliantly.  From the beginning of the film where he walks across the bridge to the hopeful conclusion when he walks down the road with his daughter and his best friend, you believe and root for this character.  He is small time and likely to remain so.  But he is by no means a loser.  And with that optimistic closing, perhaps Neil Jordan wanted the audience to know that George's daughter would be saved, by his love and his genuine decency, from the same horrid, sleazy fate as Simone or Kathy. It brought tears to my eyes, anyway.

A word about Michael Caine.  He is, as usual, terrific.  I said in another review that he can play just about anything.  (Walter Matthau was one of the few other movie stars to share this ability.)  Evil and despicable (""Mona Lisa""), clumsy and romantic (""Hannah and her Sisters""), ruthless (""Get Carter""), funny and rascally (""The Man Who Would be King"") and, of course, cool (""The Ipcress File"").  I think he once said in an interview that he told Bob Hoskins that the two of them appeared in the three greatest British crime films ever made.  He in ""Get Carter"", Hoskins in ""The Long Good Friday"" and the both of them in ""Mona Lisa.""

""Mona Lisa"" is bleak and at times tough to watch, but it's one of the best films of the eighties.  Five stars.",1166659200,5,1909,4.405714285714286
781193,4,6304079990,"It's a stretch to link the lyrics of Nat King Cole's recording with this movie and its title. Almost any ballad would have served. But it's no stretch at all to see why ""Mona Lisa"" became a sleeper hit, launched the career of writer-director Neil Jordan, and won Bob Hoskins an Oscar nomination. He plays an ill-tempered ex-con hired to chauffeur a call girl (Cathy Tyson) around to clients. That he will fall for her is a given; so are the tricks that screenwriter Jordan will play on them.

Hoskins and Tyson tool around London, tend to business, and bond. He is open and inquisitive, she is closed and secretive. What binds them is survival. Rarely has urban low-life been filmed as matter-of-factly as here. Sex for sale is the street currency and those who earn it are injured in ways unseen on their faces. The camera visits sordid sites never listed on tourist maps. Nevertheless, Jordan finds tenderness there, unlikely as it may be, just as John Huston found it aboard ""The African Queen.""

The movie takes a minute to pull you in and, unfortunately,  more than that to keep you there, so difficult are the cockney accents. This DVD lists English subtitles on the case which are nowhere to be found on the menu; nor are any of the easy-to-obtain extras we expect from The Criterion Collection, although there is a Jordan-Hoskins commentary. But ""Mona Lisa"" is so strongly written, acted and directed that it doesn't need any enhancements to engage us while we are watching it.",1119744000,7,1485,4.725868725868726
781194,5,6304079990,"Neil Jordan's brilliant British underworld fable is one of those films that actually improves with age. Bob Hoskins gives a subtly nuanced performance as a ""thug with a heart of gold"", just out of prison, who is immediately offered employment by his former boss, a devious London crimelord (Michael Caine, excellent as always) for whom he ""took the fall"" in the first place. Hoskins becomes the driver for a high class call girl (Cathy Tyson, in a remarkable debut performance) employed by Caine to service a select group of regular clients in discreet liaisons at posh hotels. Hoskins and Tyson get off to a tense, ""oil and water"" start, soon turning to begrudging mutual respect, which eventually mutates into something much more deep and meaningful (not what you're thinking). The story deliberately and masterfully builds into some surprising and amazing twists and turns. Hoskins and Tyson create absolute screen magic in every scene they share (like a streetwise Tracy and Hepburn). Not an altogether pleasant tale, but there is redemption, and something you don't see much in film these days-a perfect and believable ending. POSSIBLE SPOILER: For my fellow reviewer who billed his or her self sarcastically as a ""philistine"" who ""didn't get it""- I find it amusing that you complain that you don't ""want your face rubbed"" in grim ""reality"" when you watch a film. Well, if you had observed the epilogue scene a little more carefully, you would realise that what you had just spent 100 minutes having your ""face rubbed in"" was not in fact ""reality"", but essentially an adult fairy tale! (Lest we forget, Neil Jordan's previous film was ""Company of Wolves""-which was based not so subtly on ""Little Red Riding Hood""!) A must for your collection.",1118102400,4,1747,5.006872852233677

781196,5,6304079990,"""Mona Lisa"" remains one of Neil Jordan's best movies. Bob Hoskins plays George a small time thug who took went to prison to protect his boss Mortwell (Michael Caine). To reward George for his sacrifice he gives him a job chaffeuring around Simone (Cathy Tyson)a high priced call girl that Mortwell wants to keep track of. Despite her initial chilly reception, George falls in love with her. Ultimately she asks him to make a major sacrifice so she can be free of Mortwell and his world. It's a price that leads to tragedy and violence.

A brilliant film noir, Hoskins earned an Oscar nomination for his performance and really he deserved it. His portrayal of George is complex. While he's a criminal, he's also surprisingly naive and innocent in his own way and the code of conduct he follows in his life reflects much more solid values than that of a petty crook. Michael Caine shines in a pivotal but small role as Mortwell. Caine has never given a performance as nasty and chillingly evil as he does here. Cathy Tyson (""The Serpent and the Rainbow"", ""Priest"") also deserves kudos for her performance as Simone. Although the surface of her character is chilly she hints at the depths of emotion raging beneath the surface of this sophisticated and sad woman.

The Criterion edition of this looks exceptionally good with nice color reproduction and a crisp, sharp picture. It appears that the same master that was used for the 1996 laserdisc was used here, though, and it probably should have been remastered from a new digital transfer. While presented in its original format this isn't an anamorphic transfer that I can tell which is, again, another reason to update this and create a high definition DVD.

Neil Jordan and Bob Hoskins commentary track provide a surprising amount of interesting detail about the making of the movie. Usually commentary tracks with an actor and director devolves into a lovefest with little actually uncovered but that's not the case here. We learn about the difficulty that Jordan had initially interesting backers in the project and how pivotal the casting of Michael Caine was to making this project viable.

I still would have liked to have more in the way of extras for this classic film. Like the recent re-release of ""The Crying Game"", there has to be some alternate scenes that survived or outtakes that might have been of interest to fans. Additionally, why not do a retrospective documentary or a glimpse back at Jordan's career as a featurette? Hopefully Criterion (or whomever picks up the license on this film for DVD release in the US) will remaster this and add the extras that this classic film calls for.",1108771200,34,2656,4.817982456140351

Bob Hoskins gave the tour de force performance of his astonishing career with this portrait .

He plays the role of honest and self convinced being human who honestly believes his underground world can be improved . Due this idyllic behaviour he will sent to prison but he forms to Michael Caine as a future Gangster and will intend for all the possible ways to persuade a honourable prostitute to change her profession , but obviously it will be in vane .

This intelligent film somehow revealed the portentous talent of this brilliant and exceptionally gifted film maker Neil Jourdan who would astonish the world with My left foot just two years after .

This work carefully analysed is a very smart twisted gaze of the Mob so well featured in the thirties , forties and fifties for James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart .

It is good to remember the irony is a landmark feature of the English and Irish lands .it is not a mere casualty William Shakespeare , Bernard Shaw , Oscar Wilde, Jonathan Swift , Chesterton and George Orwell have been born in those latitudes

Usually loveable Michael Caine is simply hateful as a sleazy mobster who gives Hoskins a job chauffeuring an elegant call girl (Cathy Tyson).  While driving her to her assignations, Hoskins naively falls in love with her.  He wants to protect her and feels jealousy as he waits for her trysts to end. Predictably, his amateur love is unrequited - she's a professional who has lost the capacity to feel romantic love.

Like a knight on a quest, Hoskins sets out to locate the girl.  In his search he visits the creepy haunts of young women enslaved in drug-dependent prostitution.

Hot Toasty Rag, November 24, 2017

Neil Jordan, the writer-director who brought audiences The Crying Game in 1992, created another dark, mysterious story Mona Lisa. In this film, Bob Hoskins stars as an ex-con who cant find work. His friend, Michael Caine, helps gets a job as a chauffer to a call-girl, Cathy Tyson, but he has ulterior motives. As Bob and Cathy become friends, he gets involved in her seedy world and dangerous problems.

Mona Lisa is a pretty upsetting movie, even though you might not be able to tell from the beginning. It feels like just a seedy drama, but by the end, youll be extremely shaken up, and depending on how deeply you're affected, you might wipe away a tear. Bob Hoskins swept the Best Actor awards the next year, winning at the BAFTAs, Golden Globes, Cannes, Boston Critics, Kansas Critics, London Critics, Los Angeles Critics, New York Film Critics, Valladolid Festival, and National Society of Film Critics. Normally a character actor, Bob took command of the screen and owned his leading role. Even though he played a hardened ex-con, he was sensitive and felt a range of emotions deeply. At the Academy Awards, Bob lost the gold to Paul Newmans ridiculous, phoned-in performance in The Color of Money.

If you can handle a heavy story set in a less-than-savory environment, you might want to check out Mona Lisa. Its not really the kind of film youll love and want to watch over and over, but youll be able to appreciate the acting. Lets put it this way: I own The Crying Game, but I could only handle watching Mona Lisa once.

7861801,5,6304079990,"This is a stellar performance by Bob Hoskins. It's the Bob Hoskins you more or less expect (probably even came to see) but with oh so much more. Late in the movie he's asked: ""Do you ever need someone?"" And his reply: ""All the time"" is absolutely wrenching. It's a movie about loneliness and betrayal and repentance. George always seems to see the twists in the murder mystery novels he reads but can't spot the ones in his own life. The only flaw here is that the estranged daughter story-line is not quite fully realized. We get the bare bones beats but it's missing a critical emotional moment:  a reckoning or act of contrition or revelation that explains the happy-go-lucky ending. BUT this is a fantastic film. If you're looking for a more unadulterated Bob Hoskins (with some sultry Helen Mirren and a young Bond) look up a film called The Last Good Friday.",1504742400,,864,4.6103896103896105

7861806,5,6304079990,"This movie got pigeon-holed as a neo-noir, but for its first hour it's really more of a light comedy that just happens to take place in brothels and strip joints. I enjoyed that first hour, but found myself wondering where director/writer Neil Jordan was going with his material. Characters and events both turn nasty and brutish closer to the end.

The movie ends up being an actor's piece and an ensemble piece. Hoskins proves there's more to his acting range than explosive rage and his English bulldog scowl. He takes over the screen in just about anything he does, but he's really very touching here in his scenes with Cathy Tyson. Cathy Tyson matches him--if anything, she's the dominant personality. She wraps Hoskins around her finger, but Hoskins willingly accedes to it. Michael Caine, as Hoskins's mob employer, is slimier and greasier than a bottle of bad hair gel.

As I said, the movie begins with light comedy, flirts with tragedy, then makes a sudden turn into violence--gritty, gruesome, ghastly violence. I took Jordan's point to be that people try to behave according to rules of moral conduct--romantic, artistic, whatever--but when pushed to extremes, people relapse into animal responses of violence and self-defense. You can't escape your origins. The high class call-girl reverts to a hand-to-mouth lifestyle of life on the run. Ex-con Hoskins discards delusions of romance and grandeur and goes back to fixing cars with his buddy in the auto shop.

The sentiments Jordan expresses here aren't all that original, but the three main performances have made this movie a classic for many audiences ever since it was released. That's probably as it should be.",1438214400,,1679,5.054151624548736
