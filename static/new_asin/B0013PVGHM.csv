The movie opens with the voice of the Ring saying,I want to tell you one of my favorite stories which is about the OHara Brothers. Joe OHara(Tom Brown)wants to be the champ,his brother Mikes(Don Red Barry) dream is to become a concert piano player.
Joe is needlessly blinded by Tiger Johnson(John L Cason)a brute who fights dirty and will do anything to win.
Angry,Mike decides to forget about his piano dream and become a fighter in order to, sooner or later meet Johnson and get back at him for his brother.
