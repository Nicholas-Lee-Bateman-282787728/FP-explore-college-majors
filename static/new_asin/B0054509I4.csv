4558279,5,B0054509I4,"I do not know why it is that these two parts of the movie trilogy have not received the same level of acceptance in the general audience.  To each his own I suppose.  But for those who actually LIKE, or WANT, to get the entire trilogy this two-pack (along with a stand-alone Matrix release) is a very inexpensive way of getting the rest of the story, without having to pay a pretty penny for the boxed set.  This two-pack is very often discounted down to single digits...

I am not going to comment on the pros or cons of the storyline or the philosophizing in these movies.  I'll leave that to the Eberts and Maltins of the world. I for one wanted to have the complete story line.  And these are the kind of movies for which blu-ray is tailored made.  Wonderful, fantastical, highly detailed visuals, tons of visual effects, great moody lighting, invariably accompanied by killer soundtracks.  The ""extras"" on the BDs on how these movies were filmed are as interesting as the movies themselves by the way.  This is pure entertainment.",1322092800,3,1035,4.612021857923497
4558280,4,B0054509I4,This is a Matrix DVD what more can I say. If you get one you just have to get the other. Sort of like a long running winded book. You just have to see the next sequel.,1318636800,2,167,3.5405405405405403
4558281,5,B0054509I4,"Science fiction often addresses moral or ethical dilemmas introduced by technology into human situations.  The Matrix mixes these types of conflicts as well as philosophical arguments about the nature of reality, free will, and fate.  The second movie may have gotten carried away with action sequences, but this was one of the first movies that had the technology to explore what things would look like in a digital dream world.  The action does get a little tiresome in Reloaded, but the storyline keeps you interested...I fast forward through some of the fight scenes, especially the hundreds of Smiths Vs. Neo on the basketball court scene.  Revolutions gets back to some of the philosophical exploration with some overdone action thrown in.  Morpheus does become a caricature of himself in the sequels, which reminds me of Obi Wan in episodes 4-6 versus his polished and fake counterpart in the prequels.  Still the storyline in The Matrix sequels prevails.  Amazing on blu-ray.
Why no release of Revolutions as a standalone I'll never know, but at this price who cares.  Maybe we'll get some 10th anniversary double-dip edition.",1317772800,3,1134,5.125
4558282,4,B0054509I4,"I won't comment on the movies, you likely know what you are getting into.  I liked the sequels, but I never got them on blu-ray, content with my dvd versions. Instead I got The Matrix tenth anniversary edition on blu-ray. I loved it!

What this dual movie pack gives is the critic and philosopher commentaries that were only available on the Matrix Trilogy box set for these movies. Both of those are fun to listen to, and can be insightful at the same time. And it's for that reason (along with the great price) I purchased this!",1317081600,39,530,4.453608247422681

4558325,5,B0054509I4,By far the best matrix out of the entire trilogy. This is non-stop action for anyone that likes kung fu movies or nonstop machine guns fights with bullets blazing. The action scenes are top notch the Magent if this is top notch in the car chase scene at the end is on believable check this out for yourself you might be sorry,1411344000,,325,4.258064516129032

4558329,5,B0054509I4,Great packaging of the two movies.  Definitely saved some money getting this instead of the overpriced three movie pack.  I loved both of these movies.  I am someone who really liked the last movie.  Don't understand the hate some people gave it.  I thought it was great.  Blu Ray presentation was top notch.

4558330,1,B0054509I4,"So I was in best buy the other day and what did I happen upon?  Oh, a 4 pack of all matrix movies on blu ray for about 14 bucks.  When did these movies come out?  Like FOREVER ago?  Why the heck did I even buy this crappy 2 disk set if they were just gonna release all three together a few months later?

4558333,2,B0054509I4,"I just watched these movies streaming them from Amazon and then I put on blue ray dvd to enjoy better everything. Well, after streaming,not even hd version, of Matrix reloaded, watching the same film on bd player (good one) was no different picture wise and was almost as a silent movie. I had to raise the volume of TV to the levels I never use and still it was barely enough to hear anything. I don't have special sound system but usually my Samsung hdtv speakers produce fair enough  sound for everything. Very disappointing..",1383264000,,529,4.627659574468085

4558335,5,B0054509I4,"Awesome movies! Love that they are packaged together. Worked great and the blu ray looks fantastic.
I would definitely recommend these movies as well as the first one...you won't be disappointed! I only like some Sci Fi/Action flicks and these are my favorite!",1382054400,,260,5.069767441860465
4558336,5,B0054509I4,What's not to love about finishing out a matrix collection that may include a fancy version of the original movie and this set to complete it.,1381708800,,142,4.5
4558337,5,B0054509I4,"I won't review the movie, that has been done a gazillion times... but will say getting two Blu Rays in one package for $9.99 is a great deal!

I don't always watch all the extras that come in some sets, and don't always need four or five discs that come with some sets... I like the fact for this set I could get just the movies, in one package for cheap.

The case / package is really ""budget"" (aka - cheap) but for this price they obviously had to cut corners and cost.  So for those of you looking for Steelbook quality in the packaging look elsewhere... the packaging is low budget.

Another plus here is the Blu Ray transfer - it is very good.  The Matrix movies are typically set in darker settings many times, and it can be tougher to deliver crisp, clear quality with these scenes on transfer many times.  I watched it on a 65"" Panasonic VT60 Plasma, and was very pleased with the quality of the Blu Ray.

I still own the first Matrix movie in DVD Video, now I am tempted to get it in Blu Ray after seeing the quality of the transfers for the 2nd and 3rd movies.

Five stars - I have always enjoyed the Matrix Trilogy, and getting them in Blu Ray for cheap with good transfer quality is a nice bonus!

Thanks for reading!",1378598400,6,1229,4.195744680851064

4558339,5,B0054509I4,It's a different way of thinking and it is possible. The writing and special effects are awesome. I recommend this as a purchase. No menu's though. Kinda like a cheapie Blu ray from the old blockbuster days.,1374796800,,207,4.621621621621622
4558340,3,B0054509I4,Not my favorite movies of the series i think they should have only made the first one and left people guessing more between the matrix and reality. This was a time when special effects was at its peak in the movie industry so of coarse they had to make more than one so a must have for the collection although it would have been more of a cult classic if they stopped at the first one it would've been the blade runner of its time.,1373328000,,431,4.08235294117647
4558341,5,B0054509I4,This movie is stunning and amazing graphically. Blue-ray makes an already awesome experience phenomenal! The graphics are so crisp and clear. I have seen it a few times since buying it.,1369699200,,185,5.0
4558342,5,B0054509I4,It was cheap and these movies are worth it just for the crazy special effects they put into them.....story & acting is not much above average/ OK but ......,1368057600,,156,4.413793103448276
4558343,5,B0054509I4,This part of my all time movie trilogy. It was a great deal for 2 blu-rays as well. I highly recommend it.,1367625600,,106,3.8636363636363638

4558366,3,B0054509I4,"...but the low price and single size blu-ray small packaging almost make it worth having. A wrap-up to what was an extraordiary, ground-breaking flick that should have been left alone in the wake of these.",1360281600,4,205,4.885714285714286
4558367,5,B0054509I4,"I am a big fan of Matrix Trilogy, so I was always going to like this one. I wanted to buy the trilogy special edition, but found out that if I buy this twin pack and then The Matrix separately then it costs only half as much as three together will cost. Most of the special editions will come with a lot of behind the scene footage, interviews, and interactive stuff, but in my experience I end up watching only the movie most of the time and all this other stuff perhaps only once. Since both these movies are loaded with tons of special effects - it makes perfect sense to own it on blu-ray.
I recommend.",1358726400,4,606,4.188034188034188
4558368,4,B0054509I4,"It doesn't seem like these Blu-rays have any special features, just the film on the disc, so that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but the picture quality looks great. For anyone who wants to update their Matrix DVD to Blu-ray this is a great price for 2 Blu-ray movies! The films look really nice in Blu-ray, some of the CGI scenes look a little cheesy and dated when you see them in high definition, but the overall quality of the film is great, and the other special effects still look amazing.

*Edit* Other reviews are saying that there ARE special features on the discs, so I will have to check. Ours just played the movie as soon as we put it in, so I was assuming there was only the movie since it didn't go to the menu.",1358294400,,733,4.161971830985915
4558369,5,B0054509I4,Love the Matrix series-especially in Blu ray. Wished it was in 3D. These movies look and feel so real. Get it!,1358035200,3,110,4.285714285714286
4558370,5,B0054509I4,As I said in my review of the Matrix 10th Anniversary edition.  The Matix is an outstanding trilogy and the quality of the Blu Ray discs is excellent.  I couldn't believe that Reloaded and Revolutions was together and at such a bargain.,1357516800,3,236,4.595238095238095
4558371,5,B0054509I4,I never realized how old this movie was but the quality of the Blue Ray is clearly not what todays BluRays,1357430400,,106,4.095238095238095
4558372,5,B0054509I4,This is one of those movies that I'd watch over and over again. This trilogy was a pioneer in the art of slow motion.,1356739200,,117,3.9166666666666665

4558378,5,B0054509I4,I still enjoy these movies as a trilogy. Had to upgrade to blu ray since the price for all 3 movies are so cheap now. PQ and SQ are still amazing for when these got released.,1355875200,,174,3.861111111111111

4558380,2,B0054509I4,"The Matrix is a classic film and I've owned the DVD for many years.  When I saw the combo DVD Matrix Reloaded / Revolutions was at a good price, I decided to take the plunge.  Compared to the original Matrix movie, these sequels are a disappointment - too long, convoluted script and sometimes ridiculous dialog, wooden acting, etc., but to make things worse, the sound quality on this DVD is very poor.  We had to have the sound on the TV turned all the way up to hear the dialog, and then had to quickly turn down the volume for the action scenes.  I don't have this problem with other DVDs.  I'd say skip this purchase.",1349913600,,622,4.327586206896552

4558383,5,B0054509I4,So if you like the Matrix thenyou will love watching it on blu ray. So clear and vivid. Blu ray also seems to have tons more special features then the DVD. Can't beat 2 movies for 10 bucks,1335657600,,188,3.973684210526316
4558404,5,B0054509I4,"I got this pack in 10 dlls, this was a good deal for this classics, probably these movies are not as good as the first one, but if you are fan from Matrix you should get it.",1334361600,,173,3.7027027027027026
4558405,5,B0054509I4,"The picture and sound on these disc's are terrific. Getting these two films for a price of under 10 bucks is a steal. I know there have been numerous bad reviews of these movies, but whether your a Matrix fan or not, I though they were good and had excellent entertainment value. My wife had never viewed any of the Matrix movies before and though  watching 2 & 3 first without her seeing the first one she still enjoyed them overall. Was a bit confusing for her in the beginning but she got the over-all idea. Her only criticism was of the the Kung-Fu fighting scenes. which I loved. She said it was to much like being at the Opera or Ballet. I personally could have used a bit more blood ( it is a R rated film, was more like a PG to me.)
I'll now have to wait for when the first Matrix Blue-Ray goes on sale to complete the trilogy. If your a Matrix fan and have BD in your home, these are a must have for your collection.

4558406,4,B0054509I4,At this price I recommend this set. The movies have been gone over with other reviews telling what they are about else where so I won't repeat but to say that they are not the best. The series does go down hill with each movie. But if you are like me and have the Matrix you just have to have the rest so you can marathon the series.,1329868800,,333,3.911764705882353

8456200,5,B0054509I4,"This is a review for the Bluray itself (i.e. audio, picture quality, etc), not are review of the movies. Plenty of that on the web and or other Matrix related sites.

I'm not usually a fan of ""double/triple features"" movie sets and prefer to collect the movies on their own. However, in certain cases like this one, they just were not available or were in a different regional formal (PAL Boxed bluray set) that I didn't want to take chances on. I've got the original DVD's and those will be combined with this set, so I wasn't too worried about the special features as these sets typically don't have great feature sets to them and are usually just ports from the DVD in standard definition anyways. Audio defaults to 5.1 Dobly Digital, you will have to go in and set it to TrueHD, which makes a world of difference (of course, this also depends on your sound system setup). Picture quality is great given these films were from the early 2000s. Not too much grains and no flicker in resolution. If you are looking to upgrade from DVD, this set is worth it for under $10 bucks. Definitely not a great buy for a collector but it gets the job done for upgraded sound and picture quality. I will say though, if they release special edition or anniversary editions of these two films independently, I would certainly get those and sell this set - but that is just me though.",1490745600,3,1370,4.48
