This movie is well done. Just sit back and enjoy. By the way the little girl that you see at the end of the movie also appear at the start of the movie.",1129766400,13,319,3.5714285714285716
2358592,1,B000A5043S,"If you are wanting to see Steven Segal do his thing, this isn't the movie.  From the get-go it was hard to follow.  The entire movie made no sense.  Heed my advice: don't get this movie.  It is time for Segal to move on to comedies now.",1127779200,,236,3.9574468085106385
2358593,1,B000A5043S,"September 13th 2005 heralded the release of 'Today You Die', Lord Steven Seagal's latest offering to his mass of devout followers.  The movie, before its release, got a bit of a reputation due to the fact that the Lord was consistently late to set, usually left early, constantly changed the script, actors, etc.  I also believe that Seagal is actually getting sued for his Lordly antics.

'Today You Die' has an inconceivable plot, but I will do my best:  The Lordage is an ex-thief trying to go straight so he picks up a job as an armored car driver, only he's setup by some criminal mastermind named Max to take the fall for the robbery of the armored car.  But somehow or other(its never really explained), the Lord does what the Lord does and ends up with the $20 million that Max was supposed to have stolen.  The Lord is captured by the police and sent to prison(with no trial mind you).  There he meets his apparently new best friend Ice(former Naughty By Nature rapper Treach in a truly Oscar-caliber performance).  Well, the Lord and his new bosom buddy break out of prison.  Of course the evil gangsters want the money that the Lord stole from them back.  But Seagal can't let that happen.  Its not really about the money, but more of a moral principle-type issue for him.

Now that is a much more coherent outline of what actually happens in 'Today You Die'.  There's actually a whole lot more that I left out:  Seagal's girlfriend's psychic visions which mean absolutely nothing to the film, the PMSing female cop who puts him in prison and then becomes his best buddy for no apparent reason once he breaks out, the second bad guy in the film that has nothing to do with the evil Max, and the little girl at the end of the movie who nevers appears or is even mentioned in the entire film but to Seagal apparently has some important connection .  This movie makes no sense at all.  None.

Now, onto the Lordage:  he actually looks as if he's slimmed down a bit(maybe dropping from 350 pounds to around 320).  His hair is disguistingly nappy and he doesn't even bother ponytailing it; it just hangs limply over his collar in total mullet fashion.  There are a couple bright spots here though:  #1) there's minimal dubbing of the Lord's voice by someone else(see 'Out Of Reach' or 'Submerged' for some examples of how not to dub someone's voice)and #2) Seagal rocks a totally sweet brown pleather coat for about half the film.

With the film's excessive use of stock footage from other direct-to-DVD films, overly obvious use of a stunt double for Seagal(even in situations where no stunts are involved), horrible editing, and a completely nonsensical and confusing plot 'Today You Die' is easily Seagal's laziest film to date.

I'd tell you to save your time and skip it, but every other Seagal fan out there like me will go buy 'Today You Die' and watch it anyway.  So if you must watch it, there are only three amusing things to look for:  Seagal's sweet pleather jacket, the Lord talking Jive to his new black buddy, and Seagal swinging on a chandolier.  Hilarious.

I love the Lord and would give him my first born, but why does he torture me with filth like this so often?",1127520000,51,3188,4.557117750439367
2358594,4,B000A5043S,"This is a good one. Seagal's last few movies have been somewhat hit or miss, but this one is a hit. Not a lot of hand-to-hand stuff like his early movies, after all he is getting on in years. But lots of action and a minimum of the psychic, mystical stuff that sometimes bogs down his films. This one had much better production values then some of his recent movies as well; no dubbing his voice and some cash was spent on blowing things up. Lots of cars, a helicopter, even an entire building. No special features on this disk though.

Steven gets set up and someone has to pay. Actually a lot of someones. If you are a Seagal fan you'll like this one, hopefully his upcoming movies can match it.

Enjoy!",1127260800,3,705,4.293233082706767
2358595,1,B000A5043S,"I had the honor of being a late comer to the Seagal DTV series.  I rented Out For A Kill, Submerged, and Today You Die all on the same day.  I'm still spitting the sour taste from my mouth.  I couldn't even get thru the first two and clenched my teeth to get thru Today You Die.  Why, oh why does he use stunt doubles for such simple things?  Were these snippets filmed after he left the set for the day so the double was used?  Even if he is getting too old for this stuff, anyone can choreograph these types of moves fairly convincingly.  Hell, The Duke and Bronson continued their own fistfights well into their 70's and even 80's for Bronson. (check out Hard Times to see Bronson in multiple extended and very convinving fistfights without the use of a stunt double and with his shirt off at the age of 54)

Now I own and can enjoy the likes of what some say are Seagals  worst - Fire Down Below, On Deadly Ground, and Half Past Dead - and I even found I found the Foriegner an okay watch, but Today You Die, Out for a Kill, and Submerged are altogether garbage and unwatchable. Not that Seagal is bad but everything else involved in these films absolutely stinks.  Maybe they're not paying the man enough to make a complete film?

Attn Hollywood:  Seagal has lots of fans and considering the trash that makes it to the theatre these days(The Core, The Cave, etc), lets give the man a good script and a budget worthy of a good film...",1127260800,2,1438,4.265682656826568
2358596,3,B000A5043S,"Forget about everything Seagal has done since Exit Wounds & Half Past Dead and pretend this is his next release. This movie has a plot and held my attention the whole movie and Seagal returns to his bone crunching old self as this film has the most fight scenes and action since The glimmer man. Not his best movie but better than Half Past Dead and about the same as Exit Wounds. This one could have been sent to box office but with Seagal the only starpower they sent it to DVD, but it looks big budget.",1127088000,3,505,4.216494845360825
2358597,3,B000A5043S,"Ol' Slabface is back in action, and taking prisoners he is not, daddy-o.  This time around he's a present day Robin Hood who steals from drug dealers to give to poor people, help re-open closing childrens clinics, and just bring a tear to the viewer's eye.  Once he tries to get a legit job, naturally it all goes to hell, he's doublecrossed and thrown in the slammer.  In prison he meets up with Treach, and in the words of Thin Lizzy, ""Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak"".  Once out of prison, he's hellbent on revenge and has no problem annihilating everyone in his path with the help of his new partner.  Once again, body doubles, fast/slow/start/stop camera tricks and good ol elbow grease are Seagal's best friends to get him through this newest direct to dvd flick.  The man's not ready to throw in the towel on his dwindling martial arts ability yet.  What does Slabface do when confronted by the only guy in the film who looks like he has martial arts training?  Does Seagal fight him and show him who's still got it?  Nope, he shoots him.  Probably actually a little worried this guy would have creamed him.  The addition of Treach makes this look like an attempt to be a poor man's Lethal Weapon type buddy movie, but the chemistry is crap.  Then again, does Seagal have good onscreen chemistry with anyone?  There's also a little supernatural/psychic mumbo jumbo thrown in for the hell of it even though it adds absolute zero to the plot.  While this one is better than some of his recent films, it's still typical direct to dvd Seagal.  I just get a strange enjoyment out of these movies.  While renting this film I told the clerk at the video store that I don't know why I continue to torture myself with these Seagal films.  He said, ""Well, at least you know what to expect"".  That pretty much sums up the review of this film:  If you're familiar with Seagal flicks, you pretty much know what to expect from this one.",1126915200,3,1934,4.505747126436781

If you dont, then you wont.  Like with his other movies, you know what you can expect.  Personally, I enjoyed it.  He doesnt make movies to win Oscars; but what he does do is make movies that are fun to watch - movies that don't take themselves too seriously.

2358688,3,B000A5043S,"There were way too many inconsistencies that make you question why certain things are put in the film that don't mean anything, and yet there are things that must be missing because it didn't make any sense.

I gotta say though, I believe it's time for Steven Seagal to retire.  Either that, or get some exercise and eat right to slim down a bit.  Maybe then, he can get about another five years of action film appeal.  This ""The Biggest Loser"" candidate needs to improve his health before he worries about making a movie that may put a little extra ""fast food funding"" in his pocket.

This is one of many Steven Seagal films that seem to just go right to video instead of being a theatrical release, and this is rightly so.  I suppose someday, they will release a special Steven Seagal: 10 movie: direct to video: box set, and they could only hope that it might sell for maybe ten dollars.",1290816000,,890,4.429447852760736

2358690,2,B000A5043S,"Today You Die (2005) is a crime thriller set mostly in Nevada, and features action star Steven Seagal as man looking to turn his life around, but instead finds himself the pawn in a criminal conspiracy.  While low on the credibility scale, this is still an entertaining direct to video release.

Seagal is Harlan Banks, a criminal type who arrives in Las Vegas, with his girlfriend Jada (Mari Morrow), looking to get a fresh start.  A man named Max Stevens (Kevin Tighe) sets Banks up with job driving an armored car.  While making a pickup of cash, Banks' partner Bruno (Robert Miano), guns down some security guards, and forces Banks to take off, with the cops giving chase.

The money disappears, and Banks claims to have lost his memory, when questioned by agent Rachel Knowles (Sarah Burton), and agent Saunders (Nick Mancuso).  Banks ends up in prison, and does a favor for a con named Ice Kool (Anthony `Treach' Criss).  In return, Kool allows Banks to join him in his escape attempt, flying out of the prison in a helicopter.  Banks and Ice Kool team up to find Max Stevens, and hopefully the missing cash.

As in previous films, Seagal is doing the interracial buddy thing again.  Seagal and Treach don't quite make the ideal pair, but they get on well enough, enjoying several fascinating discussions together.  The dialog tries to be hip, but is pretty awful.  Unfortunately Las Vegas isn't featured to very good effect, as more time is spent in behind bars in prison.  Seagal has really bad haircut, and is doubled in his hand to hand fights.  The first of several Seagal features directed by Don E. Faunt LeRoy, the film brings in a number of subplots, like rival gangs, corruption, philosophical baddies, psychic visions and altruism.  It is a confusing mix that doesn't quite gel, but the end result is people getting shot up, and things exploding, on the way to Banks and his pals skirting a murder rap, and living it up on the stolen money.",1275782400,,1957,4.697947214076247
2358691,5,B000A5043S,"First let us, Sid the Elf, explain that title. This film stole the basic plot principle from Redline that maybe if the audiance is confused enough, they won't realize we shot this movie with recycled footage, a few thousand bucks, and no permits. Then, they wanted to name the film, ""You Talk Too Much,"" but they couldn't get the naming rights from the almighty&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>. Rumor has it that the sticking point on that was Seagal wouldn't pony up the cash to buy Chad McQueen a rhinestone studded leather vest with ""Chad"" adorning the back. Oh well.

Honestly, Sid wouldn't be able to give a coherent summary of the plot for this one. That could be because there was no plot. Or, more likely, Seagal messed this one up real bad. Let us explain: It is widely known that the producers of this film sued Seagal for showing up eggregiously late for filming and changing the script on the fly. Sid's theory is that Seagal concocted a brilliant plot for the flick, but his wonderful ideas didn't across because he was trying to dispense them to the rest of this wonderful cast through mouthfuls of his ever-present White Castle Crave Case and quart of Wild Turkey. This movie was so great that it would be covered in the first week of Action B 101 at Sid the Elf University. It was so great that it has a DMF(Don Mattingly Factor) and a KHF(Keith Hernandez Factor) of one. It was also so great that it garnered the famous Robert Downey Sr. apperance. And it was so great that it deserves Drive-In Totals.

At the urging of his pseudo-psychic girlfriend (Mari Morrow,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikita-Blues/dp/B00005AX74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikita Blues</a>), he tries to go clean and seeks employ from a shady fellow (Kevin Tighe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-Eating-Gilbert-Grape/dp/B00005Q79A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's Eating Gilbert Grape</a>), but is double-crossed when the job is revealed as a heist.

As bad as Steven Seagal's DTV outings have been, ""Today You Die"" is a surprisingly decent bit of action that, at times, reminded me of the 90s action flicks of yesterday. Of course, there is no way to turn back the hands of time and yes, Seagal still looks heavy, there is some dubbing of his voice, and the extended storyline - with its useless ghost-story tangents and plot holes - are silly enough to kill off a few brain cells. But while ""Today"" doesn't match&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Urban-Justice/dp/B000VECACQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Urban Justice</a>&nbsp;for style, it's better than the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Foreigner/dp/B00007JZUP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Foreigner</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-Force/dp/B000ION79Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack Force</a>&nbsp;by leaps and bounds for choosing to focus on fun rather than pretending to be intelligent. The best example of this is probably the car chase near the beginning of the film: though it steals footage from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Top-of-the-World/dp/B00002NDLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Top of the World</a>, it's fast-paced, exciting, well-shot, and has a few one-liners thrown in for good measure to make for one of the best adrenaline scenes Seagal had been involved in for a while. In addition, the handful of fights and shootouts are satisfactory as well. Seagal's randori near the beginning of the movie and the gang confrontation close to the end are particularly worth watching.

The supporting cast also works well. The aforementioned performers elevate the fil, with Treach being my personal favorite of the rappers-turned-costars Seagal has had. Sarah Buxton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devil-s-Highway/dp/B000KGH066/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devil's Highway</a>) and Nick Mancuso (returning from both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-Siege/dp/0790732238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under Siege</a>&nbsp;movies) also do well as respective good/bad cops. The script they act out, however, is in trouble. The messiness of some of the subplots has real potential to drag the movie down for intolerant fans, and few examples better showcase the convoluted writing process of Seagal's DTV pictures as the inclusion of this movie's magic concept that has absolutely no relevance to the story and goes absolutely nowhere.

Nevertheless, if you're willing to take the overall decency of this picture with a grain of salt, it can be an interesting addition to your Seagal library. Fans thirsty enough for something halfway serviceable from the man's DTV career should find ""Today You Die"" a passably enjoyable bit of fluff.",1211068800,5,4032,7.222448979591837

He and Treach make for a particularly fun pairing and play off each other nicely. Unlike many of Seagal's earlier DTV movies, this one gives him plenty of nice character moments. The tone of the movie is much more fun and in keeping with some of his best movies like Hard to Kill and Out for Justice. If you are a fan of Steven Seagal as a personality, then you will really enjoy this movie. I give a lot of credit to the director Don E. Fauntleroy.

The plot is mind numbingly unrealistic (not even worth mentioning), in addition to the fact Seagal looks like 30 feet of bad road kill.  He's overweight (is it any wonder he wears a bulky coat throughout the movie-hide that gut, Seagal-hide that gut) and over the hill, his hair transplant looks like it was grafted from a mangy dog, and his acting is the pits.  Yet, in true Steven Seagal center-of-attention wannabe form, he gets the beautiful girl (who has to be 25 years his junior).  Yeah, right.

It's obvious to just about everyone who is paying attention (excluding Seagal), that his days as a top box office draw are long gone.  I'd personally like to see him in a Grumpy Old Men type of film, perhaps with Chuck Norris and/or David Carradine. No more of these improbable only 10 years away from senior citizen discounts though I'm still able to conquer the world through brute force type of flicks.  Yawn.

Someone needs to tell this clown that he's fat, a disgustingly deficient actor sporting a grotesquely unnecessary mangy mop of a hair transplant, with a fatally career killing severe case of an unwarranted superiority complex.  For me, his excessive narcissism comes forth in his performance, or lack thereof.  Honestly, I feel sorry for the guy.  He definitely needs to grow up.  Do yourself a huge favor and skip this one and stick exclusively to the classic Seagal films of the late '80s and early '90s.....",1191974400,2,1636,4.779359430604982
2358697,1,B000A5043S,"If you've read any of the other reviews for other noted 'Seagalists' on Amazon you will pretty much have my feelings on this film. This has got to be the worst Seagal film I've seen. I thought Out for a Kill and Ticker were his lowest points but this has got to be the king of the dung hill. I'm working my way (slowly, carefully) up to Attack Force and Flight of Fury so those might just take the title from this one, but this is not for anyone who has some sensiblity of what a good movie is.

There are quite a few amusing (and bemusing) things to look out for:

-From the opening credits, you know this one is going to be a stinker. Just listen to the crazy early 90's action guitar riffs and you'll understand. I seriously would not doubt if they recycled the soundtrack from Hard to Kill for this!

-Seagal still in the shadows like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now for about 80% of the film. Seems to be one of his trademarks now. At least there is none if any dubbing of Seagal's voice in this one. I don't think he takes the trademark arms crossed over belly posture much in this one either which is unusual (see Mercenary for Justice cover).

-The whole plot point that doesn't really surface about Seagal's wife's visions. And about his employer, Max who was 'born with the devil inside me' (I kid you not, he actually uses that line! Seagal's retort is even funnier), having some connection to a little girl in a hospital. Apparently Tibetan mandalas that have no bearing on the scene can appear out of nowhere also for Seagal to interprete. The ending like all Seagal movies nowadays is only slightly above nonsensical. All this leaves you scratching your head.

-The ability for our characters to walk away scot free. Apparently, Seagal can get away with breaking and entering (he is billed on the cover of the movie as a master thief after all), killing a number of police officers (on purpose)and a DEA agent, smashing civilian vehicles and by the end of the movie, walk free without any penalty. His buddy Ice, who for one was in penitentiary for some obvious felonious crime, is able to kill another inmate, start a prision riot, and escape from jail and by the end of the movie, fly to Switzerland, deposit stolen money, and jive walk his way out of the bank!

-The state penetentiary where all inmates are guarded (or rather not guarded) by incompetent and lazy guards. I suppose we are to believe that as an inmate, you are free to wander the corridors of this maximum security facility without any supervision. Its quite laughable.

-Seagal's confrontation scene with Bruno in the jail. Literally mops the room up with his face!

-Seagal's extensive array of jackets and coats. The long brown Matrix inspired pleather coat is particularly handsome on him, hiding most of his belly protrusion. Also, note the hip Roca-wear jeans jacket he sports when he is admitted to prison. Borrowed from Treach most likely.

-Seagal and Treach exchanging dialogue. This has to be the funniest thing the movie. Its so stilted its damn fun to watch. You aren't a Seagal fan until you have heard him attempt to speak jive. Seagal also uses more instances of the F-bomb in this movie that any other I've seen.

-Classic Seagal disarms. Shotguns, handguns, its no problem since all bad guys get close to Seagal even though they can easily shoot him from across the room.

-The stereotypical Tong gang (replete with high pitched Chinese flute music) with a small dis-homage to The Fast and the Furious. There is also a amusing part where Seagal puts a guy's head into a vice.

-Seagal (or stunt double rather) swinging on a chandolier. You'll have to rewind to actually believe this one! Which brings me to the fact that there are more stunt doubles used in this movie that any other of his films in recent memory. Its pretty embarassing.

The whole movie is just hacked. It feels like someone tried to use mostly stock footage to make a Seagal film. The director and cinematographer, Don. 'Little Lord' Fauntelroy was able to make a half descent attempt later with Mercenary for Justice, but this one seems to be his trial run and he didn't care. There are so many basic things for good moviemaking that are ignored that there are too numerous to go into detail about them. If you dare watch this 'film', you'll see what I mean.",1189382400,,4330,4.5860284605433375
2358712,2,B000A5043S,"While Today You Die is not a horrible maovie, it just isn't an exciting one either.  While I praise Seagal for keeping the movies coming, I can't praise the excitement level of his newer films.  The age and weight of Seagal I guess is catching up with him, and therefore his level of skill in the martial arts department is diminishing.  While he still kicks butt and keeps the bone-breaking alive, there is no skill to it in this movie.

The story in Today You Die is nothing exciting either.  The Seagal character is set up and set to prison.  He escapes with the help of an inmate.  The two become partners and get revenge for the guys who sent the Seagal character up.  There is a twist with one of the chracters in the film, the only interesting part, but nothing that you  may not have already seen coming.  The lack of story requires more action than this movie provides.  While scenes seem to cange often, attempting at keeping pacing strong, it still fails to heighten our most entertaining movie senses.

The bright spot of the movie is Vegas.  If you love Vegas there are plenty of clips of the city, during the day and during the night.  Perhaps the only good spot of the movie is after the first 15 minutes of thie film, there is a decent car chase scene through downtown at night.  You don't get many movies for a chase through Vegas, and this is pretty much the only reason for buying this dvd.

This movie turns out to be only good for watching the first time, just to see what happens.  Unlike most action movies that I can watch over and over for the action, I can't say that this is even worth it.  Check out the chase scene in Vegas and that's all that is worthy.",1181865600,,1683,4.322683706070287
2358713,2,B000A5043S,"This is the second direct-to-video Seagal film that I have watched in a week. As I did with Out for a Kill, I've given Today You Die two stars. I've reserved 1 star for the Patriot and Submerged. I give TYD an extra star for the Las Vegas chase scene, somewhat coherent plot, and glimpses of Seagal doing Aikido. If I could I would downgrade TYD to 1.5 stars because of the hokey vision woman/girlfriend. She and her visions (seemingly totaly unrelated to the plot) became annoying after a while! On a different note my wife and I found it odd that Seagal was the only one wearing an oversized (obviously to hide his girh) jean jacket while in prison. I should also note that our hero's mumbling was kept to a minimum. His mumbling and films' poor sound qulaity often require the use of subtitles...not this time! The average person will think this film is total crap. Loyal Seagal fans will probably add a used copy of this to their collections and continue to hope for the day that Seagal will finally come out with something halfway decent.",1157932800,6,1043,4.523809523809524
2358714,4,B000A5043S,"OK so he always wears an overcoat or jacket (and probably a girdle underneath) but for fans this movie is fun.

2358715,1,B000A5043S,"Steven Seagal keeps making films. In 2005 alone, he made as many as four films, which itself sounds an amazing feat. Not so amazing, however, if you see `Today You Die' dreadful film with a dreadful title. The press material I managed to get at Japanese theater in Osaka (yes, they dared to release it theatrically in Japan) tells you that the film was shot in only 18 days. Small wonder that none of the film makes sense, gives less actions than awful dialogues.

Steven Seagal plays one Harlan Banks, ex-master thief who is retiring from his job. Banks turns a professional driver of cash delivery van in Las Vegas, but because of the robbery committed by someone else, he is arrested and sent to a jail. Is he framed? Of course, he is, but when he can wear his trademark long jacket in jail, and meets and enlists a help from someone named Ice Kool there (played by Treach), there is nothing to worry about.

But I had to worry about because nothing makes sense in the film. We see a glimpse of one orphanage (briefly twice), but no one in the film seems to remember it. The film begins with a cheesy nightmare sequence that the girlfriend of Harlan sees (played by Mari Morrow) in her dream that portends death and danger, but this supernatural idea is just dropped in the second half of the film. There is a detective played by Sarah Buxton, whose motive to get close to Banks remains unclear, and Nick Mancuso adds confusion to the already chaotic scenario as Agent Saunders.

[DULL, DULL, DULL] The most impressive part of `Today You Die' is one car chase scene in Las Vegas with decent stunts and some nice camerawork. In fact, these scenes are recycled footages from one Sidney J. Furie actioner `Top Of the World' starring Peter Weller and Dennis Hopper (yes, I checked it yesterday). The rest of `Today You Die' consists mainly of terribly witless dialogues exchanged between Seagal's character and others, which goes like:

BODYGUARD: ""Who are you?!""

SEAGAL: `Girl scout of America.'

Naturally poor bodyguard is beaten up by Seagal clad in ridiculously long jacket, who does it with the minimum energy helped by lightening-speed editing and body doubles, which strongly suggest he is not willing to do the actions once he had shown in the films like `Above the Law.'

The film is strictly for the avid fans of Seagal, but I am afraid the number of them is getting smaller every year. I like his films in the 80s and 90s, and I admit `Today You Die' is not as bad as `The Foreigner,' but that isn't saying much.",1144368000,8,2524,4.583148558758315
2358716,1,B000A5043S,Segall mumbles alot in this flick. Movie is disjointed and makes no sense. Characters are introduced that have no connection to the story. Segall stunt double is pretty good.,1143590400,3,174,5.0344827586206895
2358717,1,B000A5043S,"As Segal continutes to move toward Orson Welles dimensions,his movies get progresivly worse. Let's hope this is his last.",1138838400,2,121,5.421052631578948
2358718,2,B000A5043S,"Much like Into The Sun, this had all the ingredients for a Seagal come back but yet again the producers of yet another Seagal movie miss the opportunity to deliver a great Seagal action thriller. The movie is again handicapped in the same manner as Into The Sun and Submerged by the recurring problem of what appears to be Seagals disregard of the script or perhaps due to the lack of a script where he seems to make up his own dialogue to fill out a scene. It's as if the camera is turned on and Seagal makes it up as he goes along, conversations involving Seagal and other characters make no sense or have any relevance to the story at hand. In Seagals recent movies there always appears to be a scene which is simply there to give Seagal an ego boast. ""Walks like a Black man, breaths like a killer"", what was that all about??

The main armored car chase scene is lifted directly from another film made 10 years ago and also the open scenes of The Order with Van Damme is used as the opening scenes in this. I also think though I might be wrong but all the aerial shots of the prison and the prison structure itself looked the same as those used in the Wesley Snipes movie Undisputed.

Seagals body double is ever present as usual, Seagals line delivery at times is terrible, yet another muddled and confusing plot and character relevance to the story, Seagal love scene!, fake back drop special effects and bad acting from allot of the supporting cast members are all here present and correct as has become the norm with Seagal movies of late.

However it's not all bad, this is a big step up from Submerged, there is no voice dubbing, there are flashes of the old Seagal when he sticks to the script and does his own fight scenes which the two while he is in prison appear to be all Seagal and he is looking in better shape than his last few outings. For me, it was worth the rental as it's not all bad but it did feel very flat and uninteresting while watching it.

In Seagal's post Exit Wounds DTV years, for me Belly Of The Beast is the mark to aim for and the only one up to and including this one to be recommended. Today You Die is worth a rental to keep up with Seagal's output but only worth adding to your collection for the die hard Seagal fan.",1137283200,7,2259,4.258741258741258
2358719,2,B000A5043S,"Seagal teams up with a rapper, again. Plays slappy hand/paddy cake fighting with some guys. Escapes from prison (always fun). Then blows some stuff up. And finally, copies Bad Boys as much as it can before it races to a close.

""Today You Die"" is a movie that goes a long way in showing that one picture is worth at least a thousand letters of hate mail.  Write in and tell Steven Seagal to give the rest of the money he would spend on making movies to the homeless and dedicate the rest of his creative energy into ending world hunger, saving those trees he cares so much about, or getting a hair cut so he doesn't look like the Count from Sesame Street after he wakes up after a full day of drinking beer and eating cheetos in his trailer. To tell you the truth, I actually like Steven Seagal. But his stuff is getting worse. Trying to watch his films now is like trying to read cursive from a cerebral palsy sufferer.

Do you even care about your work anymore?

As for the three writers (and one who wisely wanted to remain uncredited) who put this masterpiece of gratuitous violence, cursing, and aimless wandering together, if you guys can call yourselves writers, then the guy who decided to put ""Famously Fresh"" on the top of Planter Cashews Nuts can call himself a writer. Why did you put the psychic woman in the film! You guys must have smoked some crack after you wrote yourself into a corner. Have you ever heard of continuity? Well, maybe having the little girl at the beginning and at the end of the movie was an effort at that. Good Job on that one boys! You confused most of your audience again b/c the girl has no significant meaning to Seagal's character except that she is in the film for him to hug. Or maybe you were just trying to tell me that he is a deadbeat dad/friend/uncle (who is she?) who only cares about this girl in a superficial way. I'll buy it then. Nevertheless, when you write another script, here's a hint about the whole girl signifying a return to family/normal life thing: have Seagal call her/look at a picture of her when he's alone/bring her up in a conversation. Or actually put her in the movie in a significant way. Just a small suggestion.",1133308800,3,2187,4.405940594059406
