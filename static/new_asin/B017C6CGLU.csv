If you can tolerate Troma stuff (I can't), then maybe you will like this movie. The Interwebz will tell you that this movie is great, but check carefully. The IMDB rating comes from very few reviews.",1449100800,,347,4.612903225806452

7498784,1,B017C6CGLU,"As a low budget filmmaker I appreciate what they were going for and there are some fantastic funny lines  but there were several things wrong with this movie.  I wasn't rooting for any of the characters,  none of them were believable enough to take seriously.  I didn't care about the theme if there even was one.  This made a great shot film that they used for the crowdfunding pitch but when stretched out into an hour long feature,  it fails.  Slow parts where the editor should've cut but let things run on.  The footage is mixed with B-Roll from old movies that jolts you out of the story.  About half way through we decided to quit wasting our time.  Had we been more involved in the characters we probably would have continued watching.  Good parts:  -dialog is funny,  -concept is interesting,  -the wolf attack was funny,  -the idea of Helen Keller as a bad-ass is great.",1447718400,2,880,4.551282051282051

This movie is by far one of the better movies to come out this year ,and that's sad considering their budget was literally a fraction of some of the big Hollywood hits this year. You must watch this movie, you will not be disappointed Ross Patterson delivers again and again and again. So I've heard in the rumor mill that Ross is working on a movie called Range 15 which is supposed to be a veteran cast supported by some big Hollywood names including Shatner from what I understand it's supposed to be one of the more epic comedies betraying the military of its kind.",1447372800,2,711,4.435114503816794

7498836,3,B017C6CGLU,"Not as expected. Not in the same vein as pride and prejudice and zombies. The humor is not literary. I really can't judge whether it is good in its genre.  Language, topics are  vulgar, if that is a single word for college age potty humor. Not recommended for kids on this merit, not because of violence. Having enjoyed early Dr Who, am open to imperfect production value in the face of a good story, and I would believe the movie was made with a lot of enthusiasm, but  it's not a style I like.",1451865600,3,495,4.24468085106383
7498837,4,B017C6CGLU,"Boy this move was awful, but in a good way. Filled with Helen Keller jokes, this one claims to be the ""true story"" about how Helen Keller lost her sight and hearing. Farrelly Brothers' favorite Lynn Shaye plays Helen as an old woman, relating her adventures to her grandchildren. Barry Bostwick, who has a few cult classics under his belt, seems to be having a lot of fun as a crazy hunter, pursuing the wolves that ruined his life. Terrible special effects add to the charm.

7498838,3,B017C6CGLU,"This is the third in the series of a Masterpiece Theater spoof hosted by St. James St. James (pronounced Saint James Street James). In this story he corrects history by giving us the real story of Helen Keller, made blind and deaf by nightwolves, which she learned to fight blind and deaf.

The film is designed to be campy and spoofs modern society and film making, but not as good as they could do it. The jokes got old and the bits were expected. The anachronism shamelessly abounded as part of the humor, but when flooded by them, it loses its appeal. Helen Keller jokes were very funny when I was nine, as an adult, they are simply old...besides they missed the best ones and messed up others.
