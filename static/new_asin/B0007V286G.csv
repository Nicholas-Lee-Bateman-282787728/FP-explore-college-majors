There were no visuals, music, etc. The video would have been enhanced with external aids. It was difficult to watch this one person talk the entire time.

I also purchased The Standard Deviants-Learn Public Speaking at the same time. It was wonderful!!! It was light yet very helpful, had some comedy and a variety of presenters. Loved it!",1171238400,5,500,4.9523809523809526
8296570,5,B0007V286G,"I purchased several 'how to' DVD's about public speaking and there is no question that this one was the most helpful to me.  If you live in the USA (like me), you probably won't have heard of Paul Daniels.  If you live in other parts of the world chances are you have heard of him.  The reason is that he is a very well known British personality who has had bis own TV show on the BBC for more than 20 years.  His shows have been transmitted in just about every country on the planet apart from the States!  I have heard him compared to the UK equivalent of Johnny Carson.

Basically, Paul is mesmerizing to watch. He teaches in an entertaining way, and it makes learning the subject so much simpler.  He covers just about everything you need to know, not only to overcome your fears of public speaking, but also to enhance your presentation.  Solid, practical advice that you can put into practice straight away.  Highly reccommended.",1109635200,25,935,4.485207100591716
