8503591,5,B006RJN3GG,"I got this DVD several years ago, thinking it probably wouldn't work well, but I was sort of desperate. I followed it everyday, other than weekends, and I lost 15 pounds in about 3 months doing this alone, not changing my eating or doing anything extra. I thought it was pretty good results. I gained 30 back from a medication I took so I'm trying it out again for the second time.
It really does work if you stick to it. Im sure if you changed your eating habits it would leave even better results!",1496102400,,499,4.2631578947368425

8503593,1,B006RJN3GG,"They say this workout is for BEGINNERS? Are they nuts? I had to look at the DVD to see if I bought the wrong one, thinking it was for ADVANCED EXERCISE FREAKS!  OMG!  I thought I was dying after 30 minutes, and it was only the warm-up! HAHA!",1431561600,,241,4.0
8503594,5,B006RJN3GG,"Makes you work and sweat.  Was definitely sore the day after.  Bi weekly progressive workouts.  Instructors tell you that if you can't do the exercise, just to keep moving.",1398384000,,172,4.862068965517241
8503595,5,B006RJN3GG,"This DVD is great to workout to. I usually enjoy walking for excercise, but this DVD was a lot of fun and breaks up the monotony of walking",1362528000,,139,4.0
