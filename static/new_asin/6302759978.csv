Romantic, FUNNY, and it's PG. (PG is good for a first  date!)",953251200,8,215,3.7777777777777777
506095,5,6302759978,"While it does not star any of the *Brat Pack* this is definitely an 80's classic.  It was one of those movies that used to come on HBO or Showtime like 4 times a day because there were no other movies to show...and I  watched it every time.  Then in the 90's it turned inot one of the movies  that would come on at noon or 1:00 in the afternoon on Saturday on one of  the low budget local stations that had no national affiliate (before upn  and wb) and you just had to watch it.  Now it makes a rare appearance on  television, generally on the romance channel, and if you're lucky enough to  catch it you just have to watch.  It's a really bad story line and the  acting isn't oscar calliber, but the cheesy background music and the  weirdness of the plot keep you hooked.  If you don't buy this video for  yourself at least put it on your wish list and maybe someone will buy it  for you....that's what I did.",947289600,,911,4.1257142857142854

7830530,5,6302759978,This was a good movie to see from the past. What ever happened to Kristy McKnickel? It was good to see this old but goodie.,1346112000,2,123,3.96
7830531,1,6302759978,"I can usually go for a romantic, feel-good movie but this movie was ridiculously contrived in the ""love"" department.  This character had every man she ran into (and even her message takers) falling for her without any real motivation.  In the real world, men don't fall at your feet or as this movie seemed to portray -- THROW themselves at your feet!  I can believe that two men might fall for this character in the same timeframe but this bordered on ridiculous.  And when she finally does get laid -- she says, ""That was much better than fondue.""  OMG -- pretty lame. And the soundtrack -- monotonous.  Same musical phrasing played again and again.  Uh, two ABBA songs at the dance party does not a soundtrack make! As for the person who recommended this as a rental for a date -- I have to disagree!  Try SERENDIPITY if you want a fun romantic film for date night.",1253836800,,868,4.484076433121019
7830532,5,6302759978,"The movie was just as good as the first time I saw it years ago.  A chick flick all the way, funny and a good story line.",1253059200,,121,3.4814814814814814
7830533,4,6302759978,"This is one of my favorite movies from the '80s. Kristy is great, Michael is great. The soundtrack with ABBA and OXO really liven up the scenes. Why in the world is this not on DVD??  Really doesn't make sense when there is plenty of junk being put on DVD every day instead.",1215388800,,274,4.169811320754717
7830534,5,6302759978,This was one of the cutest movies I've seen in along time. I enjoyed this movie.  It's a beautiful love story.,1175472000,,110,4.238095238095238
7830535,2,6302759978,"I understand why Kristy McNichol had such a hard time finishing this movie -- it really wasn't ""just the way she was"" and was unworthy of her and her immense uncultivated talent.  The only thing I liked about this movie was the photo of Kristy McNichol with her finger over her lips as if she had a secret.  The ""secret"" is that she really should have been in Flashdance and not this disaster of a film!
I really wanted to like this movie simply because Kristy was in it, but have to say that it was phoney, unrealistic and didn't convince me that it was a script worthy of ever being put into production.  It seemed that it was designed to promote the careers of men, at Kristy McNichol's expense.
After seeing this movie I actually had fantasies of throwing the video off the cliff into the ocean here in San Francisco, but I didn't want to break the law.  Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie -- must lead a very boring life. Overthrow the status quo establishment that put this thing together is all this movie says to me!",1042934400,,1028,4.394736842105263
7830536,3,6302759978,"Originally filmed under the title ""I Won't Dance"" due to the protagonist's crippled leg, the last-minute switcheroo might've doomed this movie's chances(it now sounds like a rip-off of Billy Joel's unctuous song!). McNichol is really 2 people in this movie: subdued, blandly pleasant Susan in the first half--sassy and silly Susan in the second. What went wrong? McNichol left the project in real life due to a chemical imbalance, and the movie was put on hold for an entire year!(McNichol ""recovered"" in 2 weeks, but the film's snowy second-half required waiting for another wintry season... No wonder her character doesn't hang together) Fortunately, the script is good, relying on clever dialouge rather than slapstick or farcial situations. And McNichol, despite seeming a bit schizophrenic, really gives this a boost. It would be unwatchable with another, less capable actress. Overall, an enjoyable, breezy couple of hours. Yet the film's real-life troubles can't quite be masked--and what happened to the ending?",975110400,5,1019,5.415094339622642
