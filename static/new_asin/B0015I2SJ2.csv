3145119,5,B0015I2SJ2,"I really like this movie. It's a great look at a bunch of winners, and makes you ask yourself what you'd do if you won all that money. I thought it was really funny how such a big win can affect people, and also loved seeing how different people are in different parts of the country. I thought all of the people were fascinating, but I especially liked Phyllis. If anyone deserves all that cash it's someone like her. What a great lady. I love her laugh. People were applauding in the theater when she finally got her new fridge. Highly reccomended to anyone who likes interesting real people and true stories.",1212710400,3,611,4.464285714285714

Im an enthusiastic lottery player and love seeing winning stories. These don't fit that description. I think giving it one star doesnt even give it justice.",1487030400,,291,4.7254901960784315

8258732,4,B0015I2SJ2,It showed how the various ways people handle winning large sums of money.  Anyone who watches this film will definitely be educated on the dos and don'ts of utilizing a lot of money.,1388880000,,182,4.515151515151516

8258734,5,B0015I2SJ2,"I really enjoyed this DVD. Really it comes down to the people and how regular people get thrust into the limelight. People easily changed, are changed. People who are grounded and into their community, stay that way.",1235606400,,216,4.864864864864865
8258735,1,B0015I2SJ2,"This doc covers what happened to various individuals after they won millions in the lottery. There is Lou Eisenberg, a retired Jewish guy who squandered his winnings on gambling and Curtis Sharp, a black man who lost his money on high living and bad investments. On the opposite extreme, you have a group of female cafeteria workers from small town Minnesota. These ladies have not only stayed at their menial jobs but appear to be living the same penny pinching lifestyles, including saving Miracle Whip jars and buying junk at garage sales.

If this all sounds boring...believe me it is. None of these folks seem to have a clue about how to invest their money wisely or even spend it in a way that will improve the quality of their lives. The film itself is also poorly made. The cinematography is bland, colorless and makes it seem more like a doc from the 1970's than one shot in 2006. There are no real laughs, just these people rambling on about the mundane details of their daily lives. Also the film seems to have no clearly defined perspective or angle besides a general sense that the frugal cafeteria workers are behaving more reponsibly than the two boneheads who blew their money. This a tremendous bore from start to finish and not worth your time.",1223769600,3,1262,4.6591928251121075
8258736,4,B0015I2SJ2,"I found this very watchable, although if you're expecting action and wild parties, get something else.  It was very real, and interesting to see that people remain true to their characters despite winning millions of dollars.  One group of shared winners all worked in a school cafeteria and nearly all kept their jobs.  Another compulsive gambler squandered his millions.  I found by the end that it was an understated commentary on what's important in life, because the money couldn't really help unless the important things were already present.",1217980800,3,548,5.193181818181818
8258737,1,B0015I2SJ2,"I wish I hadn't purchased it.  It was awful! totally boring.  It showed the lives of 3 previous winners and how they live now (20 years later).  It actually had nothing to do with what they did with the money or any of the stuff you THINK this DVD should be about.  The stories were slow moving with turtle like music (yeah) to go with it.  When you buy these type of documentaries, you expect to hear ""What happened to my life after winning, what I did, bought, how my family reacts, this is my home.  But I don't know what the producer of this garbage was thinking, I really don't.  This views like a documentary from the lives of older people in their retirement.  Their stories could have been told by anyone! yuk.  Its now at my local video rental store, I wish I would have waited!",1215820800,3,787,4.263513513513513
