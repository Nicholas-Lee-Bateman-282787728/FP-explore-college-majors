5556984,5,B00B58FUAG,"Zany Fun!  I would hate to give anything away on this very funny movie.  Where ever they found this young girl to star in Family Weekend she could not be more perfect for the role.  The little girl that plays her sister is hilarious acting out movie scenes much more adult than her age but nothing ""R"" just creative fun.  Hope Lang is the grandmother and everyone is great in their parts.  A must see!",1385510400,2,401,4.293333333333333
5556985,4,B00B58FUAG,"I watched this because I like Kristin Chenoweth. She is a fine actress, and this story allows her edgy over the top willingness to do anything to percolate perfectly through the character. However, the all-too-zany family is hard to take. (And Mr. Modine is, as usual, limp and ineffectual--though his character is just that.) I realize this is a comedy, and a silly one at that, but the children are all so ""creative"" and intense that the story gets lost at times. And a fine story it is at heart. A young girl wants her self-absorbed and selfish parents to accept the roles they once did, as parents. Not perfect parents, not heroes, not some Oprah-fied gladiators performing the world's toughest job, just parents doing what they should do. And could do, if they thought about their children as much as they think about themselves.

And it has a nice examination at how plans can get out of hand. People plan, but life doesn't always cooperate. And life bats last.

Some funny stuff, some great slapstick, some tender moments, some sharp lines. Overall, not perfect, not something I will watch again, but definitely worth a look. Far too many parents have indeed abrogated the once-natural roles of the task, and the consequences have been frightening. And its not just poor parents who have done so. The emotionally stunted and desperate children can live in million dollar home as well as dingy apartments. Children need a parent's love, heck, they need the love of two parents, and when one (or both) is absent, whether physically or just emotionally, the children suffer.

So laugh as we see the result of that suffering. This movie works.",1376870400,2,1646,4.809187279151944
5557016,3,B00B58FUAG,"If you liked Juno or Easy A, then you'll get the humor in this movie and enjoy it.  It is well acted and pretty entertaining... The plot sounds ridiculous, and you might think that you're about to watch a movie that could be a silly farce beyond anything reality could hold.  But the characters take a movie where the plot is outrageous and they still imbibe the movie with some touching moments and some really hilarious scenes.

That being said, this movie is NOT worth renting for the Amazon price.  Check it out in a movie rental subscription forum or a rental kiosk.",1376697600,3,571,4.514563106796117
5557017,5,B00B58FUAG,"Last night I saw this movie on Netflix, but then went over to Amazon to immediately buy this movie. Why? Because it's just that good. Kristin Chenoweth is one of the most underrated actress in Hollywood--spot on every time. She has impeccable comedic timing and facial expressions. But this movie is certainly more than just Kristin--and it would have to be to really succeed as this is very much an ensemble production.

Relative newcomer Olesya Rulin (that is if you don't count small parts in ""High School Musical"" trilogy), is a total standout in this role, and also carries much of the emotional balance of the movie on her shoulders. She plays Emily, an uptight and often more disciplined kid than the rest of the adults in the movie (much less in real life), but is also a kid who sometimes makes horrifically bad decisions. I really think Olesya deserves much of the credit in turning what  could have been a cheesy and wholly unbelievable slapstick comedy made for ABC Family, into a nuanced subversive intimate portrait of an extreme version of what many modern families actually are like--and the consequences and emotional impact of when that family unit breaks down.

That being said--this movie is also hysterical. It probably helps if you have both an appreciation for modern art as well as a little knowledge about it's history (Warhol, Pollack etc.) as there are several sight gags as well as verbal jokes that otherwise would be missed. Matthew Modine as the free spirited stoner parent/painter is equally deplorable as well as adorable. He also is practically pitch perfect in his role-really everyone in this movie carries their own weight--even the child actors. Joey King's acting out of several characters and scenes from ""Taxi Driver"" as well as ""Reservoir Dogs"" is equally uncomfortable as she's just a child as well as side clutching hilarious (much like Chlo Moretz's role in ""Kick-A**"").

It's funny, but I actually wanted to show this movie to some tweens I regularly babysit as I thought they would both enjoy it simply as entertainment--but that it also might help them deal with some of the issues dealt with in the movie that pretty much all teenagers go through. Then I realized that this movie was rated R, and decided I might wait a year or two as the R content though very mild and brief is still probably pushing the line too far for where the tweens are at right now. However, I have no doubt that I will eventually show this movie to them, and that they will both enjoy it as well as appreciate the emotions and themes the movies deals with.

Very funny, very heartwarming. Recommended for ages mature teens-mid 20s, and parents of young teenagers as well.

***Side notes, if you happen to see the main trailer for this movie--it looks super dumb and cheesy. Ignore the trailer and watch the movie. This is one of the rare cases where the trailer doesn't do the movie justice.",1374969600,5,2916,4.764356435643564
5557018,5,B00B58FUAG,"Anything with Kristin Chenoweth in it wins in my universe. It could be the worst movie ever and I would still love watching her.

5557019,5,B00B58FUAG,"I really had fun with this movie. Good rental for the whole family.

All actors do a good job in the film, especially Olesya Rulin.",1373846400,3,131,4.24
5557020,4,B00B58FUAG,"Ok, so that's kind of a stupid name to give my review ...

Family Weekend was surprisingly good !  Seemed like it could go either way a number of times, but it kept me entertained the whole way through.  The acting by Olesya Rulin was excellent.  She is beautiful, and a joy to watch on screen.  Most of the film she is prim and proper, and only at the end does she let her hair down.  Mom and Dad are stereotyped but still somewhat believable.  Joey King is fantastic as a little girl who copies scenes from movies perfectly.  She could have stolen the film if they'd let her.  All the characters were strong, even though some were hard to like.

It was interesting to see how Emily's character started out so clear about how things should be, and came up with a very organized plan for rebuilding her world by remaking her parents.  As the film progresses, she starts to question all this, and to see elements of their dysfunction showing up in her own life.  By the end, she is forced to realize they are human, and therefore imperfect people.  And as much as she is mad at her family for being wrapped up only in their own lives, she has to see that she is pretty much the same.

It's like Little Miss Sunshine meets American Beauty !  Picture that ...

One thing I can't figure is the swearing and sexual references.  I thought it was all tasteful and fine, but because it is a movie about family togetherness and the way that can disintegrate over time, it has a pertinent and powerful message for families - which will be missed because people won't watch it with (young) kids.  I wonder what target audience the film makers were going for.  It's not that there's anything really bad, but I don't think I would show it to young kids, who would probably like the movie because of the theme of getting your parents to pay attention to you, just because of that.  I don't know - maybe it would float over their heads.  Hard to say.  Sometimes movies or books about kids are not really made for kids.  This may be one of those.",1373587200,2,2030,4.340425531914893
5557021,3,B00B58FUAG,Each of the actors were enjoyable.  Something was missing~couldn't put finger on it.  Storyline extremely predictable.  Watchable enough though.  It's okay.,1372982400,,156,6.285714285714286
5557022,5,B00B58FUAG,"This was a well-crafted movie.  It was surprising in that the premise sounded weak, but the story line and acting made it believable.  The performance by Olesya Rulin was worth the price of admission.  The direction of this diverse cast was expertly executed by Benjamin Epps.  It was a very entertaining movie.  Worth the watch.",1371513600,6,329,4.909090909090909
5557023,4,B00B58FUAG,"I had read reviews on this movie and also assumed that since it went straight to DVD and not at theatres that is was not a good movie. I decided to buy it anyway just to see if I could be seen as an extra in the final scene, figuring it would be something cool for my grandchildren to see. We all watched it together while camping and I thought, even though I don't condone illegal activities, the message of the movie was very appropriate for todays parents and society. I really enjoyed it...and yes...I am seen many times in the movie which made it even more fun and my grandkids loved seeing me in a movie.",1369872000,3,610,4.222222222222222
5557024,4,B00B58FUAG,"Surprisingly charming comedy about a teen who drugs and ties up her parents in a desperate attempt to get them to notice her and her siblings.  In a way this is a kiddie version of the Kevin Spacey movie The Ref.  The first two thirds or so before the movie turns schmaltzy are energetic and funny and the cast is uniformly fine.  However, some parents might find scenes in Family Weekend inappropriate for their smaller children.  The most obvious example would be the main character's little sister played by Joey King (Ramona and Beezus) who fancies herself an actress and during the early film is frequently in character as Iris, the child prostitute that Jodie Foster portrayed in Taxi Driver, complete with surprisingly salty language.  She gets the film's biggest laughs but some parents probably won't find a seven year old swearing and talking about her sexual parts funny.  Other R rated movies she acts out scenes from include Reservoir Dogs and Dog Day Afternoon, although the humor in these scenes will probably go over your kids heads--that is, unless you are as bad of a parent as the ones in the film.  Family Weekend is funny and sweet and ultimately heartwarming, but if you plan to watch it with your kids keep in mind that it's a little naughty as well.",1368489600,7,1273,4.707207207207207
5557025,5,B00B58FUAG,"First, kudos to Matt K. Turner who created this wonderful group of characters. The film opens with everything pristine white, neat and orderly. It is an ideal household on the surface. This world quickly falls apart as we discover the family has drifted apart. The family cast of characters:

Dad (Matthew Modine) is a has-been artist. He smokes pot and sleeps a lot. He is a 60's hippie type.

Mom (Kristin Chenoweth) is the family bread winner. She is a workaholic and the least likeable of the family.

Emily (Olesya Rulin) is the centerpiece to this tale. She jumps rope competitively and would love some family support.

Jack (Eddie Hassell) is the older son who describes himself as a ""raging homosexual."" He makes short features for the Internet and wants to be called ""Thor.""

Lucy (Joey King) is my favorite. She loves movies and fancies herself an actress. When we first meet her she has immersed herself into ""Iris"" the child prostitute from ""Taxi.""

Mickey (Robbie Tucker) is the introverted young son who memorizes every spoken word. No one ever questions his memory.

Grandma Gale or GG (Shirley Jones) is The father's mother and doesn't get along with his wife. She is somewhat New Age in this film.

When everyone in the family missed Emily's semi-final jump rope competition she is upset and devises an over the top plan to force her parents to act like parents. I was laughing out loud over the antics and at Lucy.

Joey King was fantastic as she assumed multiple film roles, none of which any parent would allow a nine year old to watch. At the end, the film then shifts to heart warming mode as do most indie comedies.

8562649,4,B00B58FUAG,"I saw this as a trailer for Vehicle 19 and it looked somewhat amusing.  Another independent movie from 2012, rated R [and for no particular reasonwell OK, there are references to smoking marijuana and sex, and some rare swearwords but no full nudity and no particular violence either.  To me, this would spell PG-13.]

This is one of those growing-up stories with Olesya Rulin, an actress I didn't know, in the lead as a high schooler whose way of dealing with her very dysfunctional family is devoting herself passionately to competitive jumprope.  Yeahwho knew?  Really, I never knew that some of these stunts had even been DONE.  But that isn't the main focus of the movie, its more a plot device, although still the competition scenes, while brief, are impressive and fun to watch.

The story starts out seeming too stereotyped and the family too dysfunctional to even exist as a family.  And you have to wonder how Emily [thats Olesya] could grow up so apparently normal with such screwball parents and siblings.  Gradually however, the story draws you in.  Matt Modine as the father looks vaguely reminiscent of Owen Wilson, crossed with Jeff Bridges.  And Kristin Chenowith looks..a lot like Chenowith.  Shes the biggest name in this ensemble but the whole cast pulled equal weight acting, in my opinion.  And then there's an older brother, and a younger sister, and a friend...

Without revealing plot details Ill say by the end I found it equal parts amusing and heartwarming which feels like a terribly over-used word, but I thought it fit.  And if that is not enough then let me say that ONE BRIEF SCENE, with a minor character dancing to music, is TOTALLY enough to make the ENTIRE MOVIE worthwhile.  There are a few bonus features on the DVD, including an extended cut of that very dance scene tho sadly, the extended part is without the music, which was awesomeso counting this extended scene, I had to watch the dance three times, it was so fun.  Theres also an extended version of another dance involving Emilys brother, which isn't quite as hilarious as the first one, but still good.  It's a cute movie.",1436832000,,2121,4.764383561643836
