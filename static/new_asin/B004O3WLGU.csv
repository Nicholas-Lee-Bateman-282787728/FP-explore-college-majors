8436955,5,B004O3WLGU,"You can tell director Dave Boyle was influenced by the likes of The Beatles HELP! and other great and quirky rock n' roll films. SURROGATE VALENTINE captures the quirky, bittersweet yet hopelessly romantic music by Bay area based singer-songwriter Goh Nakamura. Don't let his laid back, ""hey dude"" NoCal veneer trick you. Goh is a triple threat, and one heckuva singer and lyricist. It is truly surprising to see such a natural performance for a guy who's never acted before. I've seen this film a number of times and each new viewing gets better and better.

This Cassavetes inspired road movie makes you want to root for the down on his luck singer who wanders aimlessly like an Asian American Man in Black. Like all rock n' roll films, there's always tinges of sadness and cynicism. But, with a crush-worthy performance by Lynn Chen as our hero's object of affection, the film is fulfilling but leaves you wanting more, and also provides that ray of hope for said hero. SV is actually part 1 of a planned trilogy, so I can't wait to see where Goh's journey goes next!",1325808000,2,1070,4.661375661375661
8436956,5,B004O3WLGU,"This movie made me laugh and cry at SXSW. Wasn't sure what to expect but was pleased and surprised to discover a beautifully shot, moving film, thanks in large part to Goh Nakamura's nuanced performance and Dave Boyle's direction/camera work. Highly recommend for first dates.",1308096000,2,276,5.155555555555556
8436957,5,B004O3WLGU,"Saw the screening of this wonderful indie film at the Seattle International Film Festival. The movie is set in San Francisco, Seattle and LA; it captures that relaxed, west coast indie vibe perfectly. The film was shot in black and white because, according to the director Dave Boyle, ""Goh [the star of the film] looks better in black and white."" (to which Goh quipped during the Q&A, ""I need to find a color blind girlfriend."").

The movie follows Goh Nakamura (who plays himself) on a journey of self-discovery as his quirky, talentless-yet-egocentric ""new best friend"" and ""wingman"" (played by Chad Stoops) forces him to ponder the romance (or lack thereof) in his life.

Goh's music was the inspiration for the film and deserves accolades apart from it; but when combined with Boyle's film-making skills, it's indie perfection.",1306713600,2,831,5.0583941605839415
8436958,5,B004O3WLGU,"Viewed the movie at the Seattle International Film Festival, Loved it, LOVED IT!  Goh is funny and very talented!  I enjoyed the music, the wit, the shy love, the filmography; all of it!  Dave Boyle created an excellent piece with Goh Nakamura, Chadd Stoops (Danny) and Lynn Chen (Rachel).  It's not often I purchase a movie for viewing more than once (like music), but this was deserving, not to mention it has music I want to hear again and again.

Glad I got to see it at the SIFF too, managed to score a signed copy of the DVD along with the soundtrack!  Rock on!",1306713600,2,567,4.352380952380952
