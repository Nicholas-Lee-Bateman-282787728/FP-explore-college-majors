8649444,5,B00JAGF9NI,"It's amazing to me how much better horror thrillers used to be years ago! During the 70s and 80s, there was an influx of horror films that came down the line! Just as in the United States, the other countries had to jump on the band wagon also! In the UK, in the seventies, Pete Walker made some excellent horror thrillers! This movie is very well made and very well acted!
I had never seen it before purchasing this Blu-Ray...but I am glad that I did! The image on the Blu-Ray looks fine and there are a few extras on this one...but nothing all too impressive! There are trailers for other Pete Walker Blu-Ray releases...as well as Pt. 2 of an interview segment with
the director. I wish that a commentary track had been included...as well as the theatrical trailer...but to no avail!
Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and I highly recommend it to fans of horror thrillers!
This is not extremely bloody...and it doesn't need to be. It sets out to shock and disturb you...and leave an impression...AND IT SUCCEEDS at doing just that!",1476748800,,1041,4.602150537634409

They all had stories that suggested that people in authority (especially in the Catholic Church) will more than likely abuse that authority and abuse it in such an underhanded way as to cause the deaths of the people they are supposed to be protecting. In THE CONFESSIONAL, that authority figure would be Father Xavier Meldrum (Anthony Sharp), a Catholic priest who tape records all his parishioners' confessions and murders those he considers too permissive. When Jenny Welch (Susan Penhaligon) goes to confession and tells Father Meldrum that she has had an abortion, he decides that all those involved should be punished. He throws a pot of hot coffee in the face of Jenny's friend Bobby (John Yule), who he mistakes for Jenny's boyfriend, beats and burns Jenny's boyfriend Terry (Stuart Bevan) with a flaming incense burner and buries him in the church cemetery. He hopes Jenny will come to him and ask him to help her. We slowly learn that the good Father has a sickly mother (Hilda Barry) that he loves very dearly but is being abused by one-eyed caretaker Miss Brabazon (played eerily by Walker regular Shelia Keith), whose reasons for abusing her will be revealed later on. Jenny's sister Vanessa (Stephanie Beacham) and border Father Cutler (Norman Eshley) learn of the recording from Jenny and try to get it back. When Father Cutler confronts Father Meldrum about the tape, Meldrum plays another tape that makes Jenny look like she is lying. Father Cutler doesn't buy it and digs for more clues, including why a grave in the church cemetery which should be empty has a mound of dirt that goes above ground level. Father Meldrum goes to the hospital and kills Bobby so he cannot point the finger at him. Jenny catches him in the act, but no one will believe her. A priest a killer? Pish, posh! Vanessa and Father Cutler become lovers. How do you think Father Meldrum will handle that situation? Mrs. Davey (Julia McCarthy) tells Jenny that she knows that Father Meldrum is a killer and offers to help her but is killed during Communion when the Father gives her poison wine and a wafer. Things come to a boil in the finale, a strange concoction that only Walker and McGillivray could pull off. It's a corker! With films like FRIGHTMARE, HOUSE OF WHIPCORD (both 1974) and SCHIZO (1976) under their belt (THE FLESH AND BLOOD SHOW [1972] and THE COMEBACK [1977] are two of the very few of Walker's 70's horror films that McGillivray did not work on), each dealing with dark secrets and a hint that the Church may have too much power over everyone's life (both moral and professional), Pete Walker and David McGillivray made thinking-man's horror films of the 70's, even though they didn't skimp on the gore. These are intelligent horror films which, I think, will become cult classics in the years to come. If cerebral horror doesn't scare you, grab these films and enjoy them before someone in authority decides that the truth cannot be handled by the masses. THE CONFESSIONAL is also known as HOUSE OF MORTAL SIN (also available on Blu-Ray from Redemption Films/Kino Lorber under this title) and THE CONFESSIONAL MURDERS.",1410220800,8,3249,4.8558558558558556
