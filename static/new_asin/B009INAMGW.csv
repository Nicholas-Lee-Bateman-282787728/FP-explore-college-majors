8542040,5,B009INAMGW,"I already had the DVD of Agrippina conducted by Jean-Clause Malgoire, so I was not sure what to expect of this version since I had not heard of any of the singers, conductor, or orchestra.  I was pleasantly surprised.

This is a wonderful and dedicated performance that does not need to apologize for the lack of star performers.  The singing and playing is great.  I like the staging and costumes as well.  The picture quality is excellent and the sound quality is one of the best I have heard on Blu-ray.

Many of the big name labels like to boost the vocals on opera recordings but this one sounds just right.  There is a natural balance between the vocals and orchestra that sounds like you are sitting in the front row.

Highly recommended for all Handel fans.",1508889600,,765,4.532846715328467
8542041,5,B009INAMGW,"to be honest about, I have never heard of the outfit that gave us this Agrippina, but it came out well. The regie is German,i.e. little crazy, but not too much and the singing is definitely good. There are not many Handel's Agrippina on video, and this one is filling a void. Buyable.",1389484800,3,284,4.377358490566038
8542042,4,B009INAMGW,"Agrippina is one of Handel's earliest operas, composed during his stay in Italy.  It is a comedy with two intersecting plots: the title character's machinations to persuade her husband, aging Roman Emperor Claudius, to designate her son, Nero, as successor; and the competition of Claudius, Nero, and General Otho (Ottone) for the affection of Poppea.  Agrippina has become somewhat popular of late because of its good tunes and accessible story.

Some productions ham up the action, but this one captures the humor without taking things to excess.  The costumes are generally attractive: somewhat Elizabethan in the first act, although Poppea wears a purple low-cut top with matching pants.  Scenery ranges from minimal to nonexistent, but is not missed.  The lighting is very effective. The English subtitles are colloquial, and there are separate chapters for most arias.

With the exception of countertenor David Cordier as Ottone, the singers are not widely known, but they all perform quite well under the direction of baroque specialist Konrad Junghaenel.  Modest cuts are taken, including the closing recitative and aria by the goddess Juno, who appears to bless the union of Ottone and Poppea.

This Blu-ray's major competitor is the DVD starring Veronique Gens and conducted by Jean-Claude Malgoire on Dynamic.  I haven't seen it, but other reviewers give it kudos for the singing and knocks for the costumes and staging.  In contrast, this enjoyable production from the Saarland State Theater scores highly in both respects.",1369008000,7,1535,5.327800829875518
