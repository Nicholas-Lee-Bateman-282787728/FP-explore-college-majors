8515480,5,B007EWDHNE,"This is an awesome dvd it covers Mick Foley's entire run in ECW. This was my favorite part of Foley's career. He really helped elevate ECW into a great company. His dream match with Sabu was awesome. His classic teaming of Mikey Whipwreck against The Public Enemy was great too. Those two played well off each other. Foley's matches against Terry Funk were maybe the best on the dvd. Those two guys held nothing back when they wrestled and were the definition of hardcore. Also on here are his great matches with The Sandman.

  Foley's Heel character in ECW was great when he turned against the fans doing anti hardcore promos. That whole angle was great. I feel like it really stirred a lot of emotions and touched nerves. When Foley was putting over WWF and WCW ECW fans were very mad. Foley teaming up with Raven was great. I thought they were two great characters and worked well together. Their match against Dreamer and Funk was one of the best tag team matches in ECW history.

  Some of the rare bonus matches you get are Foley vs Chris Jericho and Foley vs Bigelow. The Jericho match was great. Bam Bam was always an underrated big man. It's too bad he walked out on ECW. He could have done more but while he was there he achieved a lot. Foley also has some great matches with Shane Douglas on here. Douglas for some reason never could make it in WWF. I don't it helped him the people in power disliked him. Douglas was a very underrated wrestler and one of the best ever in ECW. In Foley's last match even after selling out to WWF he was still cheered. I think the fans appreciated all he did for ECW. I think he did what was best for his family and it's evident his heart always laid in ECW.

  This is one of the best dvds I ever bought. Foley was one of the greatest hardcore wrestlers of all time and helped make ECW. He probably is the greatest hardcore wrestler ever. This dvd represents wrestling when it was at it's best. The price is a little high for the set but it's worth it as the dvd covers everything. Cheers and Enjoy!",1402099200,,2045,4.332460732984293
