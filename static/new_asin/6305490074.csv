Let me put it this way: I saw it as part of a double feature with Disney's ""The Cat From  Outer Space"", and it made that poor excuse for entertainment shine in  comparison.

1035147,3,6305490074,"I'd like to start by saying that I'm not a parent, and I wasn't offended by the DVD.  However, I think Full Moon really made an odd choice on this DVD.  The movie itself is rated PG.  Therefore, I could see some kid wanting to see this(maybe-LOL).  When you pop in the DVD, the first add is for Full Moon Grindhouse featuring repeated censored boobs, talk of elections (rhymes), and other perversions.  Again, I personally wasn't bothered, but I really thought this was an odd choice for a PG rated film.  Do companies not even think about these things anymore?

The film itself was fine.  There was one loud grasp(?) in the sound during one scene.  Other than that the sound was fine.  The picture had a slight haziness at certain times, but it wasn't enough to matter.  It's a good solid print. - I realize it's an old B-movie, and that this is probably as good as it gets.

As for the film itself, if you are reading this, you probably already know something about it.  The selling point for me was the aliens.  I love the way they look.  The fact that their dialogue isn't translated is fun too.  I enjoyed the film, mainly because I knew not to expect too much going in.  I give it a middle rating - 3 Stars.",1370131200,,1213,4.32

1035202,3,6305490074,"Billy (played by Kim Milford) is an alienated Mark Hamill look alike who lives out in the middle of the nowhere where he hangs out with his girlfriend and spends his time fighting with local bullies (one of whom is, oddly, played by Eddie Deezen).  One day, Billy is wandering around the desert when he happens to find an alien ray gun.  At first, Billy simply has fun using the ray gun to blow up billboards but soon, the ray gun starts to possess him.  Can local Dr. Roddy McDowall cure him?  Will government agent Gianni Russo capture him?  And finally, what about the two Claymation aliens who show up looking for their missing ray gun?

When I was a kid, Laserblast used to show up on TV during the weekends and I always made a point to watch it.  Back then, I thought Laserblast was one of the greatest films ever made.  I thought the two Claymation aliens were really cool and I even related to Billy's sense of alienation.  I used to wonder what I would do if I found a laser gun out in the middle of the desert.  As I got older, I forgot about Laserblast until, one night in the 90s, I caught it on Mystery Science Theater.  This time, I thought the film was hilarious but I was reacting more to Mike and the Bots than to the film itself.  When I recently watched Laserblast on DVD, I wondered how the film would hold up now that I'm an adult who has been spoiled by years of CGI.  I wasn't expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised to discover that Laserblast actually holds up fairly well.

It's definitely a B-movie and it has a few slow spots but, once Billy gets that gun and starts blowing stuff up, the pace picks up.  However, what I really enjoyed about Laserblast was how it epitomized both the 70s (Billy even drives a van) and the type of drive-in filmmaking that has since been forced out of style by Hollywood's current blockbuster style of filmmaking.  Yes, the two aliens might just be Claymation but they're still really neat.

Some people have claimed that Laserblast is a ""so bad that it's good"" type movie but I don't know if I would go that far.  Despite all of the unintentional humor and campy moments, the film is never quite reaches the level of Plan 9 From Outer Space or even Tommy Wiseau's The Room.  However, that said, Laserblast remains an entertaining B-movie and it's sure to bring up a lot of nostalgic feelings for those of us who grew up in the 70s and 80s.  Add to that, the Claymation aliens are a lot of fun and, in the end, so is Laserblast.",1326412800,,2494,4.334051724137931
1035203,1,6305490074,"You may be looking at this movie in Leonard Maltin's book and saying, ""Wow, this has the same rating as Unforgiven, the great western, it must be good.""

Sadly, you could never be further from the truth, Maltin's rating just adds to the hilarity of just HOW BAD THIS MOVIE is. To start, you open the film with a very long credits scene that drags, get used to it, this is the way the whole film is going to go. The movie continues through the great american southwest as it slowly drags, you start up the movie with a small shoot out and that will be your only action you will see for half the movie.

The movie drags, the movie drags so much that saying it repeatedly in a review makes me feel like the review is dragging, but there is no other way to explain it, but constant drag. It drags as he drives around doing nothing, it drags when the cops get him, it drags when he finds the laser weapon, it drags while he figures out how to use the weapon, it drags until the time he gets to shoot the weapon.

The alien scenes really drag, but they speak and there isn't any captions so we can know what they are saying, so your watching them mumble nonsense, to encourage drag, they actually show clips from 25 minutes earlier in the movie, and it's not just a 15 second clip, it's like an edited version that is still LONG as they show that the Mark Hamill lookalike plays with the weapon going ""pow"" like a kid.

Anyway, back to dragging... Finally he blows a car up, which explodes at least for times, could they really pad this out anymore? After some more drag he goes to a doctor and they cut away part of his chest... then for no reason that I can think of... he blows the doctor's car up... 5 times. Then you guessed it... more drag.

What you've got here is lots and lots of drag, a car or building blowing up repeatedly, and then more drag. I love explosions, I really do, but the explosions DO NOTHING to help this movie.

After some more draggy scenes, somehow the character with the weapon who's name I can't even recall (and I watched this movie literally just a few minutes ago) winds up in a Bronx looking city blows some random stuff up, nothing major since the budget was pretty much spent on early explosions, and then the aliens arrive and shoot him. It's not entirely clear to me if he's actually dead, or the Aliens just took their tech back, but either way, his girlfriend is with him and the movie is over, roll credits...

This movie is a let down from front to back. If you wanna review movies and get a basic idea of what's great, watch a movie like Forest Gump of the Exorcist as a reference to a truly great movie, and then watch this load of crap for a reference of what is a really really bad movie.

My suggestion, don't buy it. If you MUST watch it, what the mystery science 3000 version of it, or at the very very least, just watch it on the internet. If you wanna spend money on a good movie from this era, go for Stephen King movie like Cujo or Shining, and STAY AWAY FROM LASERBLAST.",1319241600,,3019,4.220103986135182
1035204,5,6305490074,"I know the movie is corny. Its old and outdated, but let's admit that it is still fun. My kids watched it and enjoyed it almost as much as me when I was a kid. Brought back some memories.",1289952000,,187,3.8205128205128207
1035205,5,6305490074,"It's been business as usual here at Sid Corp North East division as we continue to blaze the trail of terrific B features. On this stormy Monday evening the choice wasn't easy but was a shoe in to be an entry from our beloved MST3K crew. While looking through all the choices we stopped on a nightmare from 1978 called Lazerblast and just couldn't resist. The alien on the cover, that's looks like ET's slow cousin, was enough to convince us guys got it. Even after it started to role we were very excited to see it was one of Charles Band's first films. This was a fact not known before going in but extremely welcomed. In fact this was a time when he was focused on making legitimate movies even though they fell flat on their face. Now he pumps out films that take a few days to make, but we still love them.

Lazerblast starts off with a confusing yet hilarious alien battle scene packed with stop motion goodness and horrid special effects. We then get introduced to our main character Billy who looks like a mix between Phil and the guy with the glasses from America. He's a complete toolbox that gets ragged on non-stop by everyone in town. One day as he driving around in his Cheech and Chong VW something catches his eye off in the distance. As our shirtless hippy loser hops out of his ride he finds a huge lazer gun...hence the title LazerBlast. Once he puts the gun on his arm it transforms him into an alien creature bent on revenge to all those that have given him atomic wedgies or sandpapered his nose. For some reason the only thing alien about him is they paint his face blue and put in some fake teeth, but we love the low budget enthusiasm on the part of Charles Band. The rest of the movie is him blowing sh#@ up with his lazer gun and being hunted down by a couple aliens that look like the one on the cover. Simply hilarious and fantastic at every turn.

Now granted this is for the MST3K version so naturally any lacking from the film was filled with hilarious commentary.  Whatever poor plot and horrific effects you may wine about were brought to glorious light with non stop mocking by the crew. The comments were filled with pot smoking 70's related jokes that had Sid howling out loud at about 12:30 am most likely sending crazy Richard through the roof. The aliens in the movie were nothing more then clay figures using stop motion to give life to..and it was pretty good. If you happen to watch this we'd suggest a substance of choice to take it to another level of enjoyment. Got Sid thinking how great it would have been to watch this gold mine on a classic Thursday night of years past. The type of night filled with everything we loved until Santa would barge in to di** it all up....why are you ruining this?",1282003200,,2744,4.376470588235295
1035206,5,6305490074,"Granted this would not win any awards of any kind. It is a trip back in time when computers were not used and stop motion was king. I got this movie because it took me back to when I was a kid at the Ritz, one screen, no surround sound in dobly. I was 13, light weight and had all my hair. I enjoyed showing it to my son and getting a chuckle out of it.",1277164800,,353,3.6578947368421053
1035207,3,6305490074,"I seen this movie in theatre when I was a kid. Noone else I know has ever heard of it. Released after Star Wars, it takes a couple of humorous swipes at that movie.
 The sound quality is a little flat not being 5.1 dolby. The film quality is good. It is somewhat entertaining however and I found a lot of stuff to laugh at in the form of ""cheese"".
 Kudos goes to the movies quality explosions. It raises it to an art with slow motion and multiple camera angles.
 The stop motion effects sprinkle the corn factor over the cheese and are classic effects.
 I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. Only those who have a desire for classic sci fi of the late 70's.",1265500800,,658,4.24
1035208,1,6305490074,"Laserblast: 2 out of 10: Anytime a film calls attention to its fourth wall by negatively reflecting on its competition, that film usually sucks. It was true when President Morgan Freeman referenced Armageddon in that turkey Deep Impact. It is true in Laserblast.

In Laserblast our protagonist blows away a Star Wars billboard. Apparently, the filmmakers felt that Star Wars was competition. Honestly, Laserblast is so out of Star Wars league it never even occurred to me that films were even in the same genre, let alone competition.

Laserblast is about two claymation aliens that leave behind a weapon set which consists of an oversized tube that goes on ones arm and a cheesy necklace that turns one Emo over time.

Our 'hero' is a man with troubles. His mother leaves for vacations in Puerto Vallarta abandoning him. (Cause there is nothing a teenager hates more than when the Parental Units leave town for a week.) He also has a hot blond girlfriend (the late great Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith) and a (relatively) bitchin van. So why is our hero angry? Is it because he appears in this movie?

Nope. It turns out our 'hero' is tormented by bullies. There are the local pot smoking cops that hassle him with speeding tickets (because they are jealous of his bitchin van natch) and there is Eddie Deezen.

Now there have been plenty of famous Hollywood bullies from Nelons Muntz of The Simpsons to Biff Tannen of Back to the Future. You remember Eddie Deezen from Grease where he played geek Eugene Felnic you may find him a strange choice to torment our 'hero'. He is.

Look, if Eddie Deezen is picking on you, clearly you have problems even an arm laser tube thingy is not going to solve.

In the film's defense things do blow up occasionally, Roddy McDowell shows up for a minute and the claymation alien turtles have a certain charm. Overall however this is one really bad film.

Mystery Science Theater 3000 Season 8 Episode 6: 8 out of 10: This was the last Comedy Central episode and they clearly pulled out all stops for the segments. Mike Nelson in drag as Voyager's Captain Janeway is a particular highlight. The riffing is decent if slightly disappointing considering the sheer volume of stupid on the screen. The writers also assumed that 'are you ready for some football gag' (one of Laserblasts characters resembled Hank Williams Jr.) would never get old... those writers were sadly mistaken.",1258243200,2,2407,4.783132530120482

1035290,3,6305490074,"Laserblast is an old Full Moon picture back before Full Moon was actually Full Moon.  Ya dig?  Yup, good old Charles Band is behind this wacky tale of aliens, pot smoking police deputies and lasers.
The fairly simple story is about Billy(I'm not sure how old he's supposed to be, but he looks about 20) who finds a laser gun in the desert, left behind by some absent minded aliens.  When the laser is used with the snazzy necklace that comes with it, it's....well, a laser, you know?  It also seems to have an addictive quality about it.  It turns it's user into a green faced, fanged monster looking type as well.  It also wedges an odd metallic hunk into Billy's chest(a plot point never really expanded upon).  Billy starts off by laserblasting folks who get his dander up, but soon he's stumbling around like a drunken ape blasting everything he feels like until the absent minded aliens can track him down and put an end to his rampage.
The film succeeds in making the benefits of owning your own laser gun look much crappier than you've probably imagined.  As you can probably guess, the film is quite low budget.  Most of the budget probably went for the stop motion animated aliens and the numerous exploding vehicles.  The film looks quite dark and grainy.  Roddy McDowall(and Keenan Wynn for that matter) is completely wasted in a tiny and pointless role that is totally beneath him and could have been played by some random schmuck.  Roddy must have owed someone a favor coz his appearance is solely there for the purpose of the film makers to say they had Roddy McDowall in their film.

There is lots of driving scenes a whole horde of unlikable characters. Roddy McDowall and Kennan Wynn must have needed the money. Its not for everyone, even some B movie fans might find this too difficult to sit through since the pace is a little slow & there is lots of padding scenes. 2 stars for the creatures - they saved the movie. I wish the movie would have explained the purpose of the gun, how it got there and why Kim turns into a toothy creature when he wears a necklace and celebrates after blowing things up. More explanations and less driving scenes with characters named Froggy and cops who smoke dope and share food with each other. UGH.",1228089600,,1076,4.4393939393939394

1035299,2,6305490074,"No, I don't mean that I can't understand how this movie happened. It's quite obviously a conscienceless attempt to grub some bucks off of the contemporary STAR WARS, made by people who lacked the budget and sense to pull it off; I also don't mean that I can't understand how the photography, script, make-up and special effects could be so disastrously shoddy (the Aliens and their ship excepted, of course. They're cool.)

I mean, how did it happen that Kim Milford turned in such a rancid performance? I have some theories:

1.) Milford read the script, muttered ""Oh my God,"" and chose to phone-in his performance;

2.) He decided to see what the Director would let him get away with;

3.) The Director was actually intimidated by Kim's resume (compared with his own,) and he chose to sit back and let Milford commandeer the picture, underplaying things or going berserk as the Spirit moved him;

4.) Milford really tried and was defeated by the Director and the Editor.

I'm sure there are others I haven't mentioned. It's very sad that he passed away almost 20 years ago, as he isn't here to explain himself. Let's face it, the guy was a trained actor and didn't have to work in trash like this. Unfortunately, he proved that his script-picking abilities were far from flawless (""Corvette Summer,"" anyone?)

Beyond him, why are Roddy and Keenan in this thing? How did Russo get talked into this? What about the late Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith? Why did ANYONE do it? Okay, I can understand Eddie Deezen, the ultimate over-the-top movie geek-- this was his first ""big"" role.

The producers tried to jump on the Star Wars/sci-fi bandwagon of the late 70s, but this film is chock full of bad acting, it has a very weak story, the pacing is very slow, etc., but for some reason, it just draws me in. The only decent thing about the movie is the stop-motion animation of the aliens. It's also a great look at the 70s lifestyle (I was just a kid back then, but I still remember the way things were).

The film surprisingly has some familiar faces , like roddy mcdowall - fright night- eddie deezen - midnight madness- and dennis burkley- the doors.

The aliens with their little Nazi take-off saluting their leader, cute aliens, kind of endearing. You get the feeling they felt quite justified every time they shot down another earthling who happened upon their casually leftover armnaments without asking the question of whether they shared any culpability for leaving these things behind. Entrapment anyone?This movie is about people. it is slow and so are most of those who inhabit the film which makes this a great escape from the paranoid times we live in today. It is simple and it is real, the feelings, the music even, the 70's as the perfect backdrop for this. It creates a whole lot of nostalgia for many reasons just to watch the slow pacing and basic human elements and lack of discrimination and realize that it is not boring, that maybe we don't need a security guard around every corner or intermittent warnings about the color of security from Fox News. None of that exists here, just simple people doing simple things with some intervention from some cute aliens with nasty weaponry who play on the angst of one kid who falls for it but even then doesn't go on much of a spree until the end when we have absorbed the strangely compelling enactments of various forms of pathos enough to be ready to head to the obvious back set upon which the end occurs which somehow matches the action regardless. Why didn't Billy dissolve like the last guy? Well, it would have been kind of messy for his girlfriend to pour over him. Why did they leave the weapon behind? Maybe Billy just needed a way to measure his anger. However, it seemed like the device took over his mind as it did his physiology so was that even really him?Somehow there is something innocuous about this film and maybe a couple of nerdy antagonists in a 62 Buick convert and cops eating and smoking weed and other dubious plot elements just allow the story of angst in the desert in the 70's to play itself out.

 It came out when I was about 13 and I remember really wanting to see it then because of the stop motion aliens (remember the 7th voyage of Sinbad?) I never did see it but one of my friends did and said it sucked. So I moved on with my life.
 Skip ahead 30 years to the internet age and there's my long lost baby for sale on Amazon. After playing a couple of clips of campy music and seeing the ""cult status"" reviews I was convinced to buy it. But now it's time to be honest.
 It was bad guys. Having said that I am a fan of really bad B movies (does it get any better than PLAN 9 ?) so I did enjoy it. Probably because it takes you back to the 70's, and who can't relate to that high school outcast syndrome?

I was lucky enough to see the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version of this movie though, and man, it made me laugh.  Even though I already knew how awful this film was, watching the MST3K version of it confirmed my knowledge.  I firmly believe that this film doesn't even deserve one star.

So little happens throughout this movie that it's astounding.  It would have been more exciting as a silent picture actually.  Billy walks around, drives around, and walks around some more.  Then he blows up stuff, acting like explosions all of a sudden make the movie exciting.

This movie has virtually no plot nor any other redeeming quality.  The best that can be said about it is it features some stop motion animation aliens for a full one and a half minutes total.  (40 seconds at the beginning, the rest at the middle and end.)  The closest it gets to a plot is this: Billy wears a pendant and becomes an alien.  This movie just has SO much padding.

1035384,4,6305490074,"When I was a kid back around 1980 or so, I got my mom to drop my brother and I off at a SciFi/ComicBook convention in Austin for the afternoon.  After browsing for a while we went to a conference room where they were screening movies.  My brother and I sat down and watched LaserBlast that afternoon, and it was a seminal moment in my life as a scifi fan.

 Many of the reviews here poke fun at how campy this movie is, but you have to take into account the time when this movie was released.  Granted, Star Wars did come out at roughly the same time as this movie, and people might be tempted to compare this movie to Star Wars, but that would be a mistake.  Star Wars would forever change the way scifi films would be made from that point on, but not all movies back in the late 70's had Star Wars' budget or resources; Star Wars was in another league and had the benefit of George Lucas and Industrial Light and Magic.

 This movie was probably the last movie of its era, a movie that came from the pre-Star Wars mold.  The early scifi influences are plain to see here:  the opening sequence in the Arizona desert has the old Star Trek wind effect in the background, and the aliens are filmed in classic stop motion animation ala Ray Harryhausen.

 There are a lot of other cool tidbits in this film: the heavy laser rifle that fits over the arm and allows for cool crouching poses, the crystal necklace that allows the gun to fire and controls the mind of whoever wears it, the numerous explosions filmed from multiple angles, the way the aliens wave their hands over the controls of their ship to make it turn around, the ""men in black"" character (years before MIB became popular), and even the cast.  You'll recognize a lot of faces in this film that later went on appear in other movies: the geek Froggy (the awesome Eddie Deezen), the doctor (Roddy McDowell), the MIB agent (Gianni Russo), the fat bearded cop (Dennis Burkley), and of course the main character (Kim Milford).

 When you watch this movie don't compare it to modern-day big budget scifi, but rather look at it as a nostalgic blast from the past with - yes - some great camp value.",1110067200,5,2153,4.374371859296482
1035385,5,6305490074,"The funny thing about B-Movies is that they become campy classics only when they were made with somewhat serious intentions. We crack up over ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" but when they crank out contrived spoofs like ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"" we grow bored.

Laserblast is one of those classics in the spirit of Ed Wood Jr. Released in 1978, it stars the late Kim Milford (best known for popularizing the role of Rocky Horror in the Roxy version of ""The Rocky Horror Show"") as Billy, a handsome but shy and dysfunctional young man who comes across this groovy space gun that blows people & things to smithereens. There is a catch to this magical zapping-machine: with each blast, poor Billy gradually turns from the sweet & shy guy to a physically grotesque and murderous creature who begins taking out his enemies (not to mention a few innocent bystanders). Being that the film takes place the year after ""Star Wars"" was released, Billy even takes his aggression out on a small billboard advertising the film!

All this time these Claymation Space Creatures are cruising about in a spaceship, monitoring the earthly activity of their potent zapping machine, speaking in a way-out tongue that is never revealed.

As one who enjoys spotting familiar celeb faces in B-Movies, I had a field day with this film as the cast includes Roddy Mc Dowell (it always interested me how he appeared in as many campy films as he did quality films), Keenan Wynn, Gianni Russo (best known as Carlo in ""The Godfather""), Eddie Deezen (character actor known for his ultra-nerd roles in movies like ""Wargames,"" and most recently in ""Polar Express""), and the late Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith, who appeared in scores of B-Movies throughout the 1970s. The movie was directed by Michael Rae, who went on to direct.....uh, nothing else ever again.

On a ""bad movie scale"" of 1 through 10 (1 being SO bad that it doesn't even pass as a fun B-Movie experience, 10 being a wonderful viewing experience because it's so bad!)

1035387,4,6305490074,"This is a movie in the general genre of 'Star Wars', but with no budget, script, or talent. Fortunately, it falls into the sub-genre of sci-fi movies so bad that it's entertaining. I remember first seeing this movie with the MST3K treatment, and enjoyed the cheesiness immensely. When I came across it on Amazon, I had to see it again, and was not disappointed. The plot involves a lost laser cannon and pendant set left accidentally on earth by two stop-motion turtles without shells from space and found by Billy, a reclusive loner who is taunted by the always annoying Eddie Deezen in his big screen debut. There is a scrawny love interest, a retired colonel who is nuttier than a fruitcake (hilariously portrayed by Keenan Wynn), a sinister government guy in a black Cadillac, a screen chewing performance by Roddy McDowall as a doctor, and perhaps the most irritating sheriff's deputy in screen history who gets exactly what he deserves in a most entertaining manner. In other words, every dopey stereotype in sci-fi is present and accounted for. Also featured prominently are some of the worst special effects in modern motion picture history.
Altogether, this is a laughable effort, played very seriously by all involved, thus further adding to the entertainment value of the DVD. The script is awful, the characters very over the top (especially Billy and Roddy McDowall), and there are some scenes so bad that you may have to watch them several times to really get their full effect, notably the explosions (always shot from multiple angles), and the aliens speaking their own language. This is a true sci-fi classic, just like the box claims; just understand that it's a classic because it's so bad it's good!",1080172800,10,1719,4.9106529209622
1035388,2,6305490074,"Two extraterrestrials are in pursuit of another in the Arizona desert, and when they catch up to ""him,"" they disintegrate all but the other's gun-like weapon.  They seem uninterested in the weapon, however, and leave it behind.
Enter young Billy, stereotypical teenage pariah. In an effort to escape his troubles for awhile, Billy wanders into said desert and--you guessed it!--stumbles across the powerful weapon left behind by the murdered extraterrestrial.  It isn't long, of course, before he learns how to successfully wield and fire this laser-like weapon.  Then, bent on meting out his revenge to those who shun him, the misguided youngster takes the weapon back to town and proceeds to blast just about everything in sight.  There is a price, however, for joining the intergalactic NRA: When Billy uses the weapon, it temporarily makes his skin greenish and his teeth pointy and sharp.  And worse, these changes seem to be edging more and more towards permanency each time the weapon is used.
Meanwhile, back at the cosmic ranch, the aliens that own the weapon--probably kin to the murdered bloke--are aware of Billy's activities, and they are on their way to Earth to reclaim their property.  Will Billy finally overcome the addictive allure of the laser weapon, or will he permanently mutate into his demonic, laser-wielding alter ego?  Will the aliens get there in time to save Billy, or will they be forced to commit euthanasia and put Billy the Mutant out of his misery?
Of all of the pieces of cinematic flotsam that were churned up in the wake of the highly successful (and much, much better) STAR WARS (1977), 1978's LASERBLAST is truly among the worst.  The film suffers from the lack of a coherent and comprehensible plot, and the bit of story that is there is thin, clich&eacute;, and amounts to little more than a cheap teen empowerment fantasy.  Michael Rae's direction is erratic at best, non-existent at worst, and this only adds to the confusion of the lousy plot.  Terry Bowen's cinematography makes everything look abysmally flat and washed-out, and most of the acting is as flat as the cinematography.  The few exceptions to the latter are the performances of the beautiful Cheryl Smith, who plays Billy's girlfriend; venerable and longtime character actor Keenan Wynn, who has a minor role here as a military type; and master thespian (and genre regular) Roddy McDowall, who appears here in a bit part as a physician.  Alas, the skills of these talented actors are wasted here, though, since their performances get lost within the muck and mire that is LASERBLAST.
There are a few bright spots in the production values of this dull piece of celluloid.  While not quite on a level with the work of master animator Ray Harryhausen, Dave Allen's stop-motion animation of the extraterrestrials is really pretty cool.  Fortunately, Allen would go on to do FX work for better films like 1981's THE HOWLING and 1989's HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS, to name but a few.  Also very cool is the alien spaceship in LASERBLAST.  The model was designed and built by Greg Jein, who also worked the on the models for CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977) and STAR WARS (1977) at about the same time.  Jein has gone on to do miniature and FX work for both the theatrical and television incarnations of STAR TREK, as well as for other notable films and TV shows.
In spite of the few minor highlights in LASERBLAST, the film is best avoided by serious filmgoers who prefer flicks with quality writing, talented actors, and skilled filmmakers.  The DVD from Full Moon does offer a few bonus features.  One is a behind-the-scenes featurette; the other is a very enjoyable supplemental featurette with tons of campy trailers for even cheesier films.  Indeed, this bonus material is much more entertaining than the feature film.  But unless you're really interested in what happens on the set of an awful film, or unless you're a collector of kooky film trailers, these extras are hardly incentive to purchase the disc.",1075248000,11,4023,4.904129793510324
1035389,3,6305490074,"The 1978 film ""Laserblast"" constitutes one of the earliest efforts of writer/producer/director Charles Band. If you are the least bit familiar with this guy's work, you know he is the one chiefly responsible for Full Moon pictures. This production company churned out some of the worst pieces of cinematic garbage in the history of Hollywood. Band is the one to blame, either directly or indirectly, for the ""Puppet Master"" franchise, ""Rawhead Rex,"" the ""Subspecies"" pictures, and maybe the explosion of the Hindenburg and the sinking of the Titanic. If a movie truly reeks, Band probably had a hand in its development somewhere along the line. Of course, bad movies are often fun in terms of their utter badness, and I think that's where ""Laserblast"" comes in. Here's a movie that tried to cash in on the success of ""Star Wars"" and instead scarred thousands, perhaps millions, of America's youth for the rest of their lives. You really need to see ""Laserblast"" to believe that a horror like this exists, but at the same time you will find a few things to enjoy during the trip.
This is one of the most incomprehensible films I have seen recently. The plot, as far as I can discern, involves some sort of ray gun and weird necklace that turns human beings into shambling, green faced alien killers with sharp teeth. As the movie opens, one of these mutated human beings stumbling through the desert dies after shooting it out with a couple of extraterrestrials in a space ship. These aliens are huge, clay animation dinosaurs who speak in a weird, squeaky language that the makers of the film never see fit to translate for the viewer. Before these creatures can retrieve the gun and necklace, a plane flies overhead and scares them off. This opening sequence is amazingly lame and sets the tone for the majority of the movie.
Enter Billy, a local loner with a heap of problems: his mother just left for Mexico, his girlfriend always wants him to do things like go to annoying pool parties, the local cops have it in for him, and two car loving nerds cannot stand him. Billy heads out to the desert to get away from it all and promptly discovers the discarded alien weaponry. After figuring out how to shoot the gun, Billy takes it home with him and starts to stand up to his enemies. He uses the laser cannon to blow up cars, buildings, and people, but he doesn't realize until it is too late that this technology changes him in fundamental ways. The first sign of trouble is the hard, shiny lump forming in his chest where the necklace touches his skin. Soon, Billy cannot defy his transformation and the whole town pays a heavy price for ignoring this young man. Subplots include the aliens flying back to earth to deal with Billy and a mysterious guy who makes cryptic comments about what is going on in town. ""Laserblast"" is an absolute mess of a film that raises far more questions than answers: who are these aliens and what are they saying? How did these weapons get to earth? Who is the man in the black car and why does everyone defer to him? How could an ending such as the one in ""Laserblast"" ever see the light of day? What in the world is Roddy McDowall doing in this film? Ultimately, no answers exist for any of these questions.
The movie is not a total loss, however. I will go out on a limb here and mention a few things I think make ""Laserblast"" a must see film. Fans of 1980's cinema will appreciate the fact that this film marks the screen debut of Eddie Deezen, seen here in the role of Froggy. This actor quickly locked up all of the ""geek"" roles in a number of subsequent films, such as ""Midnight Madness"" and ""War Games,"" just to name a few. His performance here closely resembles what he did in all of his other roles: play an annoying nerd who frays the nerves of those around him. Deezen always played his characters so over the top that it was a joy to watch him, and he does it here for the first time. Watch Deezen's reaction to his friend's car blowing up and tell me it isn't hilarious. I laughed so hard I cried over this scene alone.
Another significant element of ""Laserblast"" worth mentioning is the explosions. I call what I saw here the Star Chamber effect, named after the 1983 film starring Michael Douglas and Hal Holbrook. In that movie, the director used three or four cameras to capture an explosion at a drug lab and then spliced the footage together in order to show the effect from different angles in rapid succession. You have seen this effect in films before, but the people behind ""Laserblast"" elevate the technique to unheard of levels. And what explosions! Cars and buildings blow up with the force of atomic bombs, and they often explode multiple times in close up slow motion as well. You could say that this movie consists of nothing more than numerous fiery explosions stitched together between scenes of hammy acting, lousy dialogue, glacial pacing, and cheap set pieces.
The DVD does a good job of providing plenty of extras. Cast bios, Full Moon merchandise, and lots of trailers adorn this disc. The trailers especially provide several minutes of laughs because they are from movies like ""Slave Girls from Beyond Infinity,"" ""The Creepozoids,"" and ""Assault of the Killer Bimbos."" Yep, ""Laserblast"" is low budget junk, but it, and the DVD it comes on, do provide several reasons to watch the film.",1067558400,,5357,4.616352201257862

Can a movie be so bad that it's good?
Well... If you ask me, a classic example of an automobile that's so ugly it's cute is that retro-looking Plymouth PT Cruiser. So if it works for a stupid old car, then why not a movie?
I had seen ""Laserblast"" only once: It had apparantly made such an impact at the theatres that about a year or so after it was released I was among an audience of perhaps 70 or 80 viewers at the most in the gymnasium of a children's home that had rented the film reels for a private screening. (Now that just HAS to make it an instant classic!)
But there was just something about this slow-paced sci-fi film with cheesy effects that impressed me enough to stay stuck in my mind for over two decades. My recent purchase of the DVD gave me the answer why: It's so bad that it actually stands out which makes it good, and it really is quite good, despite how bad it really is. (Did that make any sense at all?)
Coming out just on the tail of the eye candy ""Star Wars"" craze, ""Laserblast"" was a break (refreshing?... doubtful) from all of the space fantasy knock-offs which deliberately tried to be good (and usually weren't) and all of the space spoofs which deliberately tried to be humorous (and usually weren't). ""Laserblast"" clearly knows that it's nowhere on the same level as ""Star Wars,"" and it never tries to kid itself otherwise, although there is clearly a fair bit of resentment toward the LucasFilm epic.
""Laserblast"" almost revels in its cheesiness. With a little refinement of the special effects, scripting and camera work it could have actually been a pretty good movie that could have done okay at the box office, and I'm actually hoping that someone (other than myself) comes up with the idea to do a decent 'remake.' But even as it stands, it's an enjoyable film.
The late Richard Kim Milford does a decent job portraying ""Billy,"" the neglected introvert living in a dead-end desert town where he is treated as an irrelevant entity by just about everyone except his girlfriend. One day he finds a long plastic and metal tube-thing and a grenade-looking neckace-thing lying around in the open desert, which were left behind in a panic by a couple of turtle-faced space aliens that speak turtle-faced space alien language without English language subtitles who were in a hurry trying to avoid detection by an airplane flying overhead just after they vaporized some green-faced guy with a happy trigger finger. (You got all that?)
The space turtles have to do a quick 180* when they get their reptilian butts chewed out by the 'BiG Boss' space turtle who shows them that another one of 'Those Obnoxious Earthlings' like the one they derezzed earlier has found the 'weapon-things' which turn unsuspecting Earth people into laserblasting rampaging green-faced monsters. So now the reptile people from outer space have to save the day yet again by destroying another one of the terrestrial mammal people in order to save all the other mammal people of Earth from the laserblasting rampage of the Billy mammal person who will soon transform into a green-faced alien monster person with sharp teeth. (With me so far?)
The ""MIB"" (not ""J"" ""K"" or ""L"" this time) catches up with the now transformed green-faced laser cannon toting rampaging Billy before the space turtles do, but when the aliens finally do get there it's apparantly during one of the biggest celebrations of the year, because the entire residential area is empty (they're probably all attending the parade or something), and when the claymation aliens destroy the rampaging Billy they use this special 'ray gun' thing which they now seem to have fixed so that it kills the monster-man but leaving his ""Billy"" body intact while vaporizing or digitizing both the laser cannon thing and necklace thing, instead of the other way around, which is how they got into this mess in the first place. (Um... I haven't lost you yet, have I?)
And THIS is the movie that stuck in my mind for so many years? I guess it's obvious to see why. It's good bad stuff.

1035393,2,6305490074,"Although watching Laserblast for me brings back a time when films like this were seen in abundance on Saturday afternoon television in the early eighties, and has a great, cheesy B-movie feel that you can only really get from films made in the seventies, it is a bad, bad movie.  The acting is terrible, the plot makes little sense.  (Who is the man in black and why doesnt he stop Billy when he gets the chance?  Where are the people in the ""city"" scene at the end? Who are the guys in the plane?)  but there is a bizzaro quality to it that will make it appealing to schlock lovers, mostly credited to the grunting green faced mutant-Billy. The DVD is in widescreen, but the trailer advertised on the box is nowhere to be found.  The picture quality sadly does not improve much from the VHS version.  If you remember seeing this way back when and look back at it fondly, by all means get it while its still available.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.",981936000,2,946,4.433526011560693
7889955,4,6305490074,"Laserblast is a low budget sci-fi thriller from Charles Band that actually could have been a decent B-movie had it been in more competent hands instead of becoming one of MST3K's funniest episodes. Even still, it is a guilty pleasure of mine and carries the nostalgia of being one of the flicks seen at my beloved Oritani Theater in Hackensack, NJ.

Laserblast opens as an alien outlaw is being pursued on Earth across a desert. After a brief firefight, the reptilian space cops (some cool stop motion FX from the late David Allen) blast the alien bad guy, but in an effort to avoid detection, are forced to flee and the alien's weapon is left behind. Enter troubled teen Billy (Kim Milford) who, aside from his girlfriend (70s exploitation queen, Cheryl ""Rainbeaux"" Smith), is picked on by almost everyone in town including, the pot smoking cops. Obviously fate puts the alien weapon in Billy's hands and now he has the power to get back at those who abuse him. With the alien weapon transforming him into something unearthly, can Billy be stopped?

Laserblast is sadly directed in a pedestrian manner by Michael Rae and a little energy would have helped a lot as even Billy's climactic rampage (if blowing up a few cars and a mailbox is a rampage) is very by the numbers and lacks any suspense. Rae's idea of dramatic intensity is to show the same explosion over and over in slow motion from multiple camera angles and have star Milford overact when under alien influence. And speaking of the acting, the performances range from bland to bad with even cameos from vets Keenan Wynn and Roddy McDowell being obvious paycheck grabs. The casting is also odd in the case of Milford who is too good looking and well built to be believable as the picked on kid especially, when nerd legend Eddie Deezen (his first flick), is cast as one of the bullies. Love to ask the casting director what the inspiration was for that casting aside from booze. But the cast isn't totally to blame as the laughably bad dialog from the weak script isn't going to help anyone's performance especially, when the director doesn't seem to be giving much inspiration. At least David Allen provides some good effects for such a low budget flick and things are blown up quite frequently.

Despite all it's flaws, I still think there is a 'so bad it's good' charm here and a lot of entertainment can be had from the epic fail of it all. And as stated before, the film does have the previously stated nostalgia element for me personally. So, I would recommend it to those who love to have a good bad movie along with their six pack or simply enjoy laughing at a cheesy 70s low budget sci-fi flick that aims high and fails in entertaining fashion.
