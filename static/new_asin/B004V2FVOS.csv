Ram Mohan an honest and hard-working lawyer was in love with Janaki the beautiful daughter of Din Dayal, a businessman. Ram Mohan was Din Dayals legal advisor, and Din Dayal accepted his proposal with pleasure. The whole Mohala joined in celebrating the engagement of the lucky pair. There were, however, two persons to whom this engagement came as a terrible shock. The first was Rami, who hid in her heart a deep secret love for the handsome young lawyer. Yet how could she, the poor neice of Ram Mohans Munshi, have dared to hope that he would care for her ? Stifling her pain she decided to join in the general merriment. The other person was not so ready to sacrifice his hopes. This was Kuberdas, a rich business magnate. His roving lustful eye had lighted on Janaki, and tho he was old enough to be her father, he determined to marry her. Din Dayals wife grew seriously ill. He had spent all his money on the preparations for his only daughters wedding. He now turned to Kuber Das for a Loan. But the wily Kuber Das not only refused to lend the money, he also demanded back a former loan he had given Din Dayal. He formulated this threat : either Din Dayal should sell his home and his assets and give him (Kuber Das) the cash, or give him Janaki, his daughter, in marriage. Janaki decided she could not sacrifice her mothers life and her fathers honour for her personal happiness. She agreed to marry Kuber Dass. Ram Mohans mother and the indignant Mohall awallahs, decided to fight Kuber Das evil intentions. Led by Rami who was determined to fight for Ram Mohans happiness, they collected the money needed to buy off Kuber Dass. Alas ! They were too late. The pherahs had been completed.
