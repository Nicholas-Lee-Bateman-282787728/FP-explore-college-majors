8455836,5,B0053XZ928,"With all the intense/insane/shredding workouts out there, sometimes I feel like there aren't a whole lot of options for those of us who just want a good, solid workout without all the anger and frenetic exercises. I've found the perfect solution in Anni Mairs' Life Force.

Everything is here--cardio, strength training, and stretching. In one-minute segments, you will work out all body parts without taking it from the top, having to memorize complicated dance steps, or flailing around and contorting your body in an effort to be cut. Basic, controlled moves are shown that take minimal learning to get down. The cardio effect continues during the strength training intervals. Three levels are shown, so this routine would work well for beginners through advanced, the only exception being super advanced or athletes who would need more of a challenge. You have the option of working out for 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes, or doing the whole 50-minute routine (not including the initial 2-minute warm up and the 8-minute cool down/stretch). If any move doesn't feel right to your body, or you have a different strength training exercise you prefer for that particular body part, you can substitute your own exercise in for that minute without losing the flow of the workout. I have to do this on a few occasions within the workout due to personal back issues. The cool down and stretch are, in my opinion, the best in any workout I've done. The pacing is perfect and the stretches are great for people whose flexibility might not be the best. The cool down music is a beautiful combination of Gregorian chant/light jazz/Indian pan pipe. It has a very relaxing, spiritual feel to it, but without putting you to sleep.

I highly recommend this workout for getting all your fitness components done in one package, for the versatility, and as a nice change of pace from the ""killer"" workouts that are out there.",1320883200,2,1927,4.9079754601226995
