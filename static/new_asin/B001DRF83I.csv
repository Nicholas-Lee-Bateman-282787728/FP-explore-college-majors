8294599,4,B001DRF83I,"The film is obviously told from the perspective of the Palestinian, which is what I expected given that the film maker is a Palestinian-American.  You would expect bias on the part of the film maker, and you would be right to do so, but I did not detect lying resulting from the bias.  True, the film maker did not mention the security threats to Israel, but the theme of the film was about the impact of the wall on people who posed no threat to Israel.  I did not walk away from this movie hating the Israelis, and the film maker could have easily have attempted to draw emotions in the direction of hating the oppressor.  Instead, I got the sense that he focus on getting the viewers to identify with the oppressed and to empathize with their situation.

Given that there was no narration, the film maker did an excellent job of capturing the plight of the innocent farmers and town's people living near the path of the wall.  It focused on the emotions tied up with the construction of the Israeli security wall. The film maker allowed the affected people to narrate their own stories, and often he allowed the faces of the scared and frustrated citizens of Jayyous to do the talking.  He also ably got across the insinuation that the fence isn't just about security and that the security reasons do not explain the path of the wall through Palestinian water and farm resources.

I like the way the film maker used the Blues, a style of music born out of the misery of a African Americans created by their white masters,  in order to draw our attention to the fact that Israelis are the white European colonists oppressing a dark skinned minority.",1349049600,4,1651,4.531986531986532
8294600,5,B001DRF83I,"This documentary is not anti-Israel. It is an insightful account of the daily struggle of the native people, the Muslim and Christian Palestinians, to hold onto their culture, their heritage and their dignity. They are rightly upset about coming home to find their farms, homes, neighborhoods, utilities and roads bulldozed down with no place to go. As the movie depicts, they do not understand why no one will intervene on their behalf. I don't either. Maybe, like South Africa, world opinion will eventually spotlight the issue of human rights here, I pray sooner rather than later.",1344470400,3,584,5.09375
8294601,2,B001DRF83I,"This documentary is more important for what it did not say than what it actually said. I once was on a bus tour of the ""separation wall"" with a guide that was Palestinian Arab.  He never once mentioned the reason (terrorism), nor did this film, why the Israeli's felt compelled to build this wall. It is very important to get all the information in matters concerning the middle-east or one will go astray very quickly. The fact is that Israel has been in an ongoing war with the Arab/Islamic world since before the establishment of the Jewish State. Having studied the history carefully, I see it more as a failure of Arab leadership than the common Arab man in the street. The separation wall does bring added hardship on the common Arab peoples and one is sympathetic to their sufferings up to a point. However, the Arab leadership is very much responsible for the ongoing conflict. They of course deny this as they would claim no responsibility whatsoever for the hardships the conflict has imposed on their people. It is all the fault of the Jews. These attitudes are of course eventually reflected in the common people under their leadership.

I will say something that will not be popular, but must be said for the sake of the truth. If it were not for the Islamic religion the problems of the region would be much less intractable. All this may in fact go way back to the separation between Isaac and Ishmael, and the desire of the Ishmaelite to have their own alternate religion, but I will leave that aside. To be a follower of Islam is to have a distain for the Jew. I speak of those that are devoted Moslems not your nominal Moslem. The film is obviously Moslem dominated. The Arab Christians in the Middle East are largely forgotten by the westerner, but they are under greater and greater pressure to conform to the Islamic narrative or be persecuted for their faith. The Americans involved seemed to be your typical ignorant leftists.

My main criticism of the film is, not that it does not have real emotional appeal, but that it lacks the necessary information about the Israel/Arab conflict that would actually add to any peaceful conclusion to that conflict. And here will be another unpopular statement. Until the Palestinian leadership can admit that their intransigence and rejection of the Jewish state is the major cause of the ongoing conflict and unneeded suffering, and until there is a complete rejection of terrorism as a political strategy, there will be no real peace or improvement of their lot. I say to any who would try to help the situation in a real way, study the history in an unbiased fashion, study Islam carefully as an objective observer.

Just as an example that was clear in the film. Every time the Israeli army was challenged they seemed to be very restrained by comparison to many police actions one has seen in other countries. I suspect that the film makers hoped that the guns firing in the air were meant to be seen as the people being fire upon by the solders but their was no real evidence of that. The attempted film effects, staging, interviews, etc. might be good propaganda, but not all that helpful in actually solving the real problems. The problems, sad to say, are much greater than the narrow view of this film. If the separation wall were removed it would not at all solve the conflict and the wall has actually saved Israeli lives.",1343779200,,3396,4.664440734557596
8294602,3,B001DRF83I,"This documentary is very well-done
in the sense that one is able to
get a close look at events that are
generally not available to people
such as myself, Americans who do not
travel internationally.
We know of them only in a vague and
detached sense and from unreliable
sources of information.

This presentation has a point of view
as do all such presentations.
As such, it is a worthy entry into
the debate, the goal of which ought
to be that justice is done.

We are made eye-witnesses to the Israeli
military implementing policies to
displace and isolate Palestinian people
in what appears to be a brutal and unjust
persecution.
We also are introduced to some of the
Palestinians who have been affected
and learn of their trials and sorrows.
The events seem to be authentic
and the filmmakers were apparently
very brave and resourceful.

The overall presentation would have
been much better if there was more
of an historical thread tying the
events together.
When isolated events are shown in
the manner of this movie,
it is easy to evoke sympathy for
either side of a conflict.
Imagine if a documentary was made
of repeated bombings of civilians
at home and in markets and cafes
in Israel,
admittedly by those claiming to
support the cause of Palestinians.

Another criticism,
which is personal and may seem trite,
is that the inclusion of ""rap"" music,
regardless of its mainstream popularity,
at the end, damaged the credibility
of the arguments for me and cast the
nature of the film down to irrational
manipulative propaganda from a loftier
height of reasonable point of view.
Perhaps the former is its true nature
and I should be grateful for the clue.
If one had sought to damage the arguments
that the documentary makes,
that would have been an excellent way
of doing it.
It was so off-putting that I sold
my copy of the DVD for that reason
alone.",1294099200,2,1859,4.71076923076923
8294603,5,B001DRF83I,"The wall depicted in this movie is not an isolated event. It comes after 60 years of the forcible dispossession of the idigenous Palestinian people from their land by an alien people who came from Europ with a zest to build a country called Israel. Since 1948, there was no limit to the expansionist nature of this new state since its sacred mission is to gather all the Jews in the world in this small territory taken from its owners, the Palestinians. It expanded from half of Palestine in 1948, to all of Palestine in 1967 and it even occupied the Sinai Peninsual from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria. It followed that by active settlement of more Jews and expelling the Palestinians from their homes and villages. There are now more than 4 million Palestinian refugees scattered around the Middle Easy, while those Palestinians under Israeli occupation are suffering daily from all kinds of blockades, and dehumanizing measures to ""convince"" them to leave as well. How cruel a country can be without getting any punishment or even criticism in USA media.",1282089600,6,1065,4.825136612021858

8294605,2,B001DRF83I,"The Arabs in this film are uniformly shown in a sympathetic way as innocent victims of land confiscation and oppressed by an unfeeling military apparatus.  The events leading to occupation are not explored, and there is no mention of Hamas or Hizbollah.  Hence, we're left with a highly subective and emotional depiction of a multifaceted conflict.",1254700800,2,348,5.196428571428571
