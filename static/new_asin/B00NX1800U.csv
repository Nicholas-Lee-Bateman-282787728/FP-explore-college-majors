Personally I marvel at every square inch of the very best creativity in art, architecture, design and entertainment that is provided in each themed Las Vegas Hotel & Casino.  And with the rapid growth Las Vegas has seen, things could only go up.  So, Steve drove around the area to catch some of the many completed and in process high rise performance acts going on in Las Vegas.  And not to forget to mention all the good word the Goodmans did for downtown Las Vegas, part of this slide show included the Las Vegas Art District and their monthly First Friday event.  Then only about 45 minutes northwest of Las Vegas, you can visit the Desert National Wildlife Refuge and Corn Creek Spring area, but hidden within the Sheep Mountains is a little heard of hike up to Hidden Valley and Forest.  You can join Steve on the hike, before he takes off the Colorado River and down south of the border to San Felipe and Rancho Grande along the Sea of Cortez in Baja California, Mexico.",1413590400,,1088,4.582474226804123
