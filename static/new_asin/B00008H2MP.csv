1848147,1,B00008H2MP,"One of the worst films I've ever seen.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.  If I could, I'd give it zero stars.",1267920000,,120,3.76
1848148,3,B00008H2MP,"I came across this low budget western on cable one night and recorded it out of curiosity. A good call on my part seeing I have liked lead actress Bobbie Phillips ever since I saw her on an episode of the X-Files as a bug expert. I believe this is her first leading role, but it's nothing to write home about. The plot - about a ruthless gunrunner trying to find his cheating wife and the money she stole from him - could have worked if they had a better script, better actors and a bigger budget. As it is, the action sequences are laughable and the dialogue makes you groan. They scraped the bottom of the barrel by getting MC Hammer to play a bounty hunter, together with a mute dwarf!

Cheyenne's only saving grace is Bobbie Phillips, who is not shy about showing some skin. You may remember Ms. Phillips as one of the background characters in Showgirls - she's one of the strippers at the club Elizabeth Berkley moonlights at before her big break. The three stars are for Bobbie!",1135814400,6,984,4.377049180327869
1848149,3,B00008H2MP,"Beautiful Cheyenne (Bobbie Phillips), wife of brutal old Captain Starrett (Bo Svenson) runs away from her husband, carrying a satchel full of money, to boot.  Starrett makes young hunk bounty hunter Jeremiah (Gary Hudson) a offer he can't refuse to find his missing wife and bring her back alive.  In the meantime Starrett also hires master bounty hunter Haddox (M.C. Hammer) and his midget Indian scout Razor (Robert Bell) to find the missing woman.

  The three-stars I've given to CHEYENNE simply mean I thought this movie was okay, not necessarily that I think many others will share my taste in low-budget westerns.  The story is nothing new.  Svenson is good as the tough husband, Hudson and Phillips adequate as hormone erupting  co-leads, and Hammer and that creepy dwarf are terrible as the chasers.  The plot moves along quickly enough, blood pellets explode is slow motion every time somebody's shot (in other words, pretty often), and the Utah location is pleasing to the eye.

  Still, CHEYENNE was wrapped in 1996 and not released, and then on television, until 2002.  It's probably safe to say that someone didn't have much faith in this one.  The three stars are for western fans only.",1104451200,9,1201,4.94

7984526,4,B00008H2MP,You like westerns? You may like this one. Main reason I bought it was Bobbie Phillips. The story line was pretty lame and oddly the people with handguns couldn't seem to shoot worth a hoot. Lots of gun fire but little reloading. Odd? You get to see Bobbie naked is a big draw if you like her character. I read her bio and she isn't sitting around doing nothing. Her and her hubby are pretty busy.,1368921600,,396,4.223684210526316
7984527,4,B00008H2MP,I bought this movie because I saw it on showtime latenight and I like looking and big tits. and bobby bell has some nice tits. now this film only and a couple of scenes where you can see them but the seens are good. story line is campy but I just fast forward to the nude scenes so that ok.,1363737600,,290,3.85
7984528,3,B00008H2MP,Not the best movie.  Shoot outs look so fake.  Not very realistic at all.  Not the best acting you will ever see either.,1362700800,,120,4.130434782608695
7984529,1,B00008H2MP,"Some of the worst acting and special effects I have ever seen.
The only saving grace in this movie, is that it finally ended.",1359158400,,125,4.25
7984530,1,B00008H2MP,"Even if the reason you are looking at this movie is because it stars hot chick Bobbie Phillips, and you were hoping that you would see her nude in this film, forget about it.  She should just wise up and use her assets in a porn movie.  But you ain't gettin any of that here.  This movie sucks to the ultimate degree of suckdom.  Save your money.",1280448000,,346,4.119402985074627

7984532,3,B00008H2MP,The reason that I got this one was that I hadn't seen it and Bobbie Phillips is my niece. I try to get everything that she did.,1269302400,4,127,3.740740740740741
