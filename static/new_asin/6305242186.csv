1003734,5,6305242186,"This has to be one of the forgotten gems of the 60's. Hilariously funny, a riot from start to finish and it captures swinging London in an ""Austin Powers"" sort of way. Being from the UK myself its hard to believe that it's not available over here. If you want an easy to watch and very funny slice of 1960's Britain then this is the film for you.",1030233600,4,346,4.102941176470588
1003735,2,6305242186,"Like a British cross between ""That Girl"" and ""Dumber and Dumber,"" this silly movie is memorable only for some of the groovy fashions and for a cameo by the UK band Tomorrow. Closer to ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"" than a movie, it is not to be mentioned in the same room as the sublime ""Blow-Up.""",1027555200,,294,4.363636363636363
1003736,3,6305242186,"If you approach this film with no expectation you will walk away feeling rather pleased, but not remembering anything five minutes later. If you're expecting the Lynn Redgrave of ""Georgy Girl"" or the Rita Tushingham of ""Taste of Honey"" or even ""The Knack . .And How To Get It"" it may have you climbing the walls. The film doesn't remotely approach Richard Lester's wit or style. The style, what there is of it, is very broad, somewhat embarassing slapstick that gives you the idea it was made up as it went along. The script is non-existant and seems to have been written under a combination of Preludin and Cannabis. It's easy to see how this film became something of a model for ""Austin Powers"". The music, by John Addison (who did Tom Jones) is good but out of place. The real discovery, the tunes by Skip Bifferty (a band whose one album is highly sought after by collectors) are frustratingly short. Certainly not a pretentious film like ""The Trip"" or ""Riot On Sunset Strip"", but an interesting curio to be savored like Cotton Candy. The film, like the times it portrays is on that cusp of youthful naivte before reality raced in. For a roller coaster ride, see this film and ""Medium Cool"" at the same time - that might give you an idea of what the 60's were at least partially about.",992044800,,1289,4.536480686695279
1003737,4,6305242186,"This film is a spoof of fame, fashion, and trends in general, and is a delight from start to finish! I bought it, knowing full well of course, that it was not meant to be anything other than a lighthearted romp through the trendiest parts of late 1960's London. Which it is. The amount of visual details is quite remarkable, and the scenes of London itself  have an authenticity about them which few films can match. The film is virtually a visual encyclopedia of the wacky and colourful styles of the 60's. As such, it is unmatched, even by the more commonly known film 'Blow-Up'; with the added bonus that it is simply a lot more fun. It misses being a full 5 stars because it is a bit predictable at times, and the plot lags somewhat towards the middle. However, for those wanting to see what 1960's London really looked like, I highly recommend this picture.",990403200,,862,4.490445859872612
1003738,5,6305242186,"Smashing Time is a terrific time capsule of a film.  Part silent film slapstick, part New Wave musical, all fun, chockful of 60's clothes, decor, and hair.  Plenty of sly visual and verbal humor to bolster the wonderful comic turns from Lynn Redgrave, Rita Tushingham, Michael York and the marvelous Anna Quayle.  Fans of camp musical numbers will be ecstatic with Redgrave's hit single, ""I'm So Young"" -- check out her groovy backup singers!  One caveat -- the thick North England accents take a bit of listening before you get in gear.  Otherwise, sheer delight.",981676800,,564,4.894736842105263
1003739,5,6305242186,"This here is the most far-out, waaay outtasite, supra-funky musical of all time! Rita Tushingham and Lynn Redgrave are Brenda and Yvonne, two country girls in search of swinging Carnaby street where their dreams of excitement and success will be fulfilled. Watch these birds go from humble dishwashers to dashing hipsters living out their Mod adventures. . . Yvonne as a new recording artist with her unmistakable singing voice and Brenda as the fashionable and hip ""face of the 1970's"". A zappy comedy farce that will leave your mouth watering for all the groovy clothes, and your heart pounding, because it's not often you get to see scenes of London's Carnaby street in the mad sixties. This is one movie the gang and I agree about. . . it's a favorite all around!",974419200,,767,4.774436090225564
1003740,5,6305242186,"A wild, wacky knockabout farce as only the British can do!  Rita Tushingham is a sugary little cough-drop tag-along to chum Lynn Redgrave, a saucy loud-mouth ""bird"" with stars in her eyes for the Pop Scene  of the Swinging Sixties.  It's silly, it's completely inconsequential, but  it's a riot from start to finish.  BUY IT!",941587200,3,325,4.836363636363636
7886635,4,6305242186,"This is something of a cult movie for us. It's a movie from the Swinging Sixties that's sort of a ""two working class girls go to The Big City by way of Alice in Wonderland"" thing (seriously, they bang the Lewis Carroll drum pretty hard). It's part Austin Powers, part Laugh-In, part slapstick, part Benny Hill.

It stars Lynn Redgrave (yes, that Lynn Redgrave) and Rita Tushingham (who was in a lot of these swinging 80s movies like The Knack as well as Doctor Zhivago) as the working class girls with Michael York (yes, THAT Michael York) as a fashion photographer because of course there has to be a fashion photographer in a movie like this. Anyway, it's totally goofy but pretty hilarious in parts (my favorite is how they make Redgrave's character into a pop star, almost despite her having any talent whatsoever). A forgotten gem.",1461196800,2,836,4.687074829931973
7886636,5,6305242186,"Absolutely silly, nonsensical and over-the-top.  Such a time piece of wonderful, colourful fashions...""had to be, gotta be Carnaby Street!""  Yet on another level a stinging critique of the very beginnings of mass media marketing.  Thoroughly enjoyed, the DVD transfer is crisp, and it's a great way to while away a bit of time getting to know the mid-60s a bit better...and a young ""Onslow"" sitting in the caff...",1439251200,,413,5.044117647058823
7886637,5,6305242186,"Lynn Redgrave and Rita Tushingham are to Smashing Time as Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb are to the Today Show's fourth hour; fresh off GEORGY GIRL, Lynn portrayed the reddish blonde Yvonne trying to make it in music (not that she would hold a candle to Petula and Cilla during that era nor Debbie and Tiffany 2 decades later) while Rita's Brenda tried to make it in modeling.  They turned the West End in its ear with their antics and long before AUSTIN POWERS and SHOUT! The mod musical, Lynn and Rita made the movie worthy of both its given title and the era.  When released, Kathie Lee was in her early teens and little Hody was just a toddler not knowing that in 2008, they would make the Today Show's fourth hour the American extension of this movie I'm reviewing:  Come to think of it, both KLG and Hoda should spoof Smashing Time's lead stars (KLG as Yvonne and Hoda as Brenda) if they do a week in London and host the show from Carnaby Street.  If there wasn't for Yvonne and Brenda, there would be no Kathie Lee and Hoda.  Oh I have only one critique, I read the back of the box; the movie was filmed in 1967 and Rita's character was said to be the face of the 1970's and I thought briefly it was made in 1971.  Mistakes aside, SMASHING TIME is one smashing movie.",1398211200,,1276,4.273858921161826
7886638,4,6305242186,"Dated? Yes. Silly? A bit. But very much of its time, and it was smashing time indeed. For nostalgic fans of the 60's",1348876800,,116,4.086956521739131
7886639,4,6305242186,"Picture the AbFab girls at 20, newly arrived in London from the provinces and meeting up with Benny Hill in Camden Town and Carnaby Street, and you'll pretty much have this movie's number.  It also reminded me a bit of ""Georgy Girl"" in that you have the popular extroverted girl who abuses her more introverted but loyal ugly-duckling friend, only to have said friend blossom into a swan.  Here, big buxom Lynn Redgrave plays the extrovert, while skinny and more conventionally pretty Rita Tushingham pulls all kinds of faces and pratfalls to make herself look like the homely shy member of the duo.  However, that's about the only similarity to ""Georgy Girl"", which had a witty and much more realistic script.  ""Smashing Time"" makes no bones about being a farce; every two minutes somebody is falling in a mud puddle, getting hit in the face with a cream pie, getting sprayed with condiments or paint, having their bubble bath fill up a whole room, falling through a ceiling, etc.  Despite this it does have some wistful, whimsical moments, such as the scene where Tushingham, newly and prettily attired from a vintage shop, skips happily down the street admiring herself in mirrors she passes at street stalls and in a truck bed.  Another sweet scene occurs where the two girls meander home from an all-nighter in the previous night's finery, which for Tushingham involves a kitty cat costume with ears and tail, and she acts like a real cat, prowling and stopping to paw through trash cans and all.  If you love zany British physical comedy and 60s fashions, you will enjoy this film.  Otherwise, you're likely to find it highly annoying starting with the beginning credits.  Also, if you're not good at figuring out broad British accents, you may have a rough time figuring out what dialogue there is.",1335830400,2,1805,4.815533980582524
7886640,4,6305242186,"I give 5 stars for the seller.  The DVD arrived quickly, about a week to get from the USA to Australia.  It was packaged well.  I had sent them a message asking to make sure it was packaged well to avoid damage, which sometimes occurs in some orders from others.
The condition of the DVD was as reported, very good.  The movie itself appears to be an older release from before the time of anamorphic DVDs (up to 2000?).  It is 4:3 cropped for 16:9.  The least liked aspect of it, is that the movie does not appear to be in sharp focus.  The picture quality appears very good otherwise with good colours.  This is a hard to get DVD, and as far as I can tell there has never been any other DVD release of this movie.  The movie itself is a must for 60s movie fans.  It is about 2 girls going to London in 1967 and various adventures happening around them.  It is one of the 60s movies with Lynn Redgrave and Rita Tushingham.  Lynn Redgrave puts on an odd voice throughout.  Rita Tushingham is like a female Ringo Starr.",1308096000,2,1017,4.2072538860103625
7886641,4,6305242186,"I'm very fond of this send up of swingin' London and its pretensions, but even if I weren't, the song Redgrave sings, about not being able to do anything, but she's young, is worth it. I've always been surprised that some punk band never covered it, or maybe somebody has and I just don't know who. Lots of fun, more fun than most of these Swingin' 60s films, most of which simply haven't held up with time.",1156636800,2,407,4.298701298701299
7886642,5,6305242186,"One of the best british films that was ever made with top stars and a lovley young Lynn Redgrave, IAN CARMICHAEL AND NOT FORGETTING THAT BIG BOSS ARTHUR MULLARD.
WHAT A CRAKER THIS FILM IS I GARENTEE THIS TO ANY ONE.",1099785600,3,216,4.2926829268292686
7886643,4,6305242186,"For anyone fascinated by the London take on the swinging sixties circa 1966 to 67, this is the one to watch.  Actually, there's not that much competition;  The Knack is overrated and handicapped by being black and white (this was NOT the time to be black and white), Help! is outrageously cooky and more about the Beatles than the 60s.  Darling, and Alfie also spring to mind, but they are less interested in the ""scene"" than this film is.
The plot is essentially a string of semi-independent set pieces strung together, some more successful than others, but for the 60s connoisseur the great thing is how they all set out to capture the mood and action of the time.  Therefore, we have in the front line a hip photographer, a Northern girl manufactured into an overnight pop star, a wild party in the Post Office Tower revolving restaurant (that dates it, doesn't it?  Before the bombs...), a far-out boutique named ""Too Much"" owned by a titled but trendy deb-type, and an ""in"" restaurant.
What the makers also capture, perhaps unwittingly, is the fact that hip London was just a tiny island in the middle of a sea of a country still emerging only slowly from the morass of post-war penury.  So we also see the desperately grimy and dismal streets of London, the inside of a typical Camden caf&eacute; (and we are definitely talking caff here, not caf-fey) and a dismal example of ghastly exploitative TV (no great change there then).
The main thing is the sheer creative exuberance of the time and the joie-de-vivre of the young hipsters.  The sixties were radically out of fashion by the Thatcherite eighties, and if you want to know why this film gives a few pointers.  The self-confidence and self-importance of the time looked distinctly like adolescent innocence by the time London had run through the terrorism, recession, explosion of sex and violence in film and TV and near collapse of the country in the seventies.  Fortunately for those of us with a soft spot for this kind of thing, the last ten years has seen a reevaluation which finally recognises just what a fantastically creative and imaginative period this was.
Not a film to watch for character development or depth, but unparalleled as an inside glimpse of a special corner of the sixties.",1086739200,25,2262,4.764705882352941
7886644,4,6305242186,"If you love slapstick films or anything from the 1960s, this DVD is for you.  This obscure film deserves to be seen and enjoyed by all lovers of the Swinging Sixties.
Rita Tushingham and Lynn Redgrave (Mollie Sugden from ""Are You Being Served?"" probably got the idea for her character's wigs after seeing Redgrave here) are two girls who decide to make their mark in Swinging London.  This film was shot entirely on location and is filled with wonderful shots of Carnaby Street and 1960's London.
Tushingham, who appeared so vulnerable in ""The Knack...and How to Get It"", really shines in this comedic roll, especially in a scene where she sneaks into the apartment of the man who is trying to seduce a drunk Redgrave.  The resulting sabotage is a pleasure to watch.
Anchor Bay released this in widesceen but there are no additional extras on it.  After viewers see this, they'll not only wish that there had been some extras, they'll also wish that additional movies about these characters had been made.",1041033600,13,1005,4.791907514450867
