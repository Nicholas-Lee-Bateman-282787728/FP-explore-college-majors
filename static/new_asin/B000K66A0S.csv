8154450,4,B000K66A0S,My parents bought this DVD for my 17 year old daughter who was in the play Bye Bye Birdie and they often joked about Ed Sullivan. I would have never believed it but she and her boyfriend sat down and watched it and were completely entertained. They wanted to know if we could get more and said that tv should bring back the variety show. Everything from Gene Kelly to balancing plates to an unhappy lion or two. It was great fun to watch,1332720000,,437,4.214285714285714
8154451,3,B000K66A0S,"Does anyone know if this DVD contains the clip of Ed singing ""When Irish Eyes Are Smiling"" with Peter O'Toole? If not, does anyone know which collection it is on? Thanks.",1260576000,,170,4.516129032258065
8154452,3,B000K66A0S,"Remember when Ed introduced Judy Carne as Judy Crane, or when he said to Jack Benny (in a sketch) that he made 800 *million* dollars a year? There's nothing like that here - just ""outrageous"" stuff i.e. imperfect acrobatics, Ed singing and clowning, and slightly agitated lions that Clyde Beautty has to subdue.
We've all seen that bizarre clip of Ed interviewing audience celebrities while the sound of gunshots are heard. The best part of this DVD actually explains the situation, which to my knowledge has always left the viewer in suspense on earlier TV Specials and videos.
One would surmise that an *amazing* DVD could be compiled with good-natured and quite hilarious clips of the Toast of Broadway. We all have fond recollections of that ""stone face"" which could change in a milli-second in response to some really outrageous circumstance.",1196121600,,847,5.01418439716312
