1850474,5,B00008LE01,"The Firm is just simply one of the best workouts for the money, and when you consider the price of joining a health club, it's downright cheap.  Add to that visible results in 10 workouts (which I have seen) and it's worth twice the price.  My only problem is, at 5 feet tall, the steps (when stacked) are hard, but I pull through.  Over a month or two, you'll be glad you persevered.  I hate cardio, so this one DVD has given me the results I desire without having to jump around.  I break up my workout into three days so I stay motivated and don't give up - lower body one day, upper body the next, and then abs.  By the time I've done one full three-day rotation, my entire body feels stronger.  I've gone from a size 10 to a loose size 8, and my goal is to hit size 4 by summer.  Starting so early in the year, it's gonna happen.  If you've never tried any other Firm videos, this a good one to start with, hard enough (with additional weights) for a more fit trainer, and just simple enough to get a coach potato into the zone.  And if you've got the courage, do what I did.  Take out your digital camera (and a tripod, if you have one), take a picture of yourself from all sides (not sucking in the stomach), do The Firm, then take another photo in about 3 weeks.  When you start to see the definition in your stomach, butt and thighs, that will keep you motivated more than any of these quotes!  I stick my new ""after"" photos on my refrigerator once a month; I'm so proud!",1107129600,11,1480,4.1328671328671325
1850475,5,B00008LE01,"Body Sculpt, led by Firm instructor Jen Carman, is a challenging total body sculpting workout. The video is formatted so you could split up what areas of the body you work on different days. The workout is divided into several segments beginning with a 6 minute warm-up. That is followed by a TOUGH lower-body workout. It seems like the leg presses on the fanny lifter are endless, but in a good way! They are difficult, but you know you will see results. There is a five minute stretching transition before a 15 minute upper-body workout. The video concludes with a final stretch and cool-down.

You do need the FannyLifter or a step stool and three sets of weights (such as 3,5, and 8 pounds). Jen is a motivational instructor - which you need for such a tough workout! Definitely a worthwhile addition to your fitness collection, especially if you love the Firm's videos, as I do!",1099872000,6,883,4.660256410256411
1850476,4,B00008LE01,"I love The Firm tapes. They're challenging and a great workout with minimal high impact. (The older tapes have much more high impact-80's kind of moves.) One of the things you really need is a step. The Firm sells the Fanny Lifter which is a two-part step - one is 6 inches and the other is 8 inches - that go together to make 14 inches. When I first started the Firm tapes, I wasn't ready (physically or financially) to get the fanny lifter, so I got a 10 inch step stool at the local hardware store. It worked great! When I was ready (about 6 months later) I purchased the Fanny Lifter with the BBS2 system. This included the other Firm item that is used in more recent workouts - the scuplting stick. It is a 4 foot tall weighted bar with ends that come off to make 2 hand weights that weigh 2 pounds each. All together it weighs 8 pounds. This video doesn't use the sculpting stick, but I thought I'd clue you in on that as well. Any of the tapes/DVD's made after 2003ish may require the sculpting stick as well as the fanny lifter.

Also you'll need a set of weights. If you're new to weight lifting, probably 3, 5, and 8 pounds. But if you're REALLY new to it - just do the workout without weights first. You'll know when to add weights as you get used to the Firm workouts.

All in all, this is not my favorite tape, but it's a good workout. I find the break in the middle between lower and upper body workouts difficult and prefer more of a mix throughout the whole workout. I also prefer a bit more cardio thoughout the workout (like in Cardio Scuplt, another of the tapes in this, the BBS, series). But, that's just my opinion. If you want a total body sculpting workout this is a good choice.",1098057600,5,1703,4.220858895705521
1850477,5,B00008LE01,"i have more than a few FIRM workouts and this one is tough but wonderful workout with more than a few different exercises from the normal firm dvds, i highly recommend this one to add to your collection. i worked out to it today  i can feel it already and am excited that i added this workout. Jennifer Carmen as an instructor is motivating and helpful with tips on how to get the best from this workout! excellent as always!",1095724800,4,425,4.3125
1850478,5,B00008LE01,"Jennifer Carmen takes you through a total workout that is 55 minutes long and you feel it the next day.  But the results are visible with continuous use in less than 10 days.  Get the Fanny Lifter, it is worth the money.  You can get it on ebay without the tapes/DVD's.  I say this because doing the leg press you feel and see the results, versus not having the lifter.  She keeps you motivated, on point with each exercise.  Another one I recommend is the Super Body Sculpt with Stephanie Corley.  The Firm did it again!!!!",1078876800,35,524,4.395833333333333
1850479,5,B00008LE01,"I'd been doing the Firm Ab Sculpt workout for a short period of time and the results have been outstanding, so I decided to purchase the full Firm Sculpt Workout Program, including the Fanny lifter.  The whole program provides an unbelievable workout with outstanding, visible, results.  You work every single muscle in your body.  Body Sculpt  is definitely a great workout.  The program is split into two parts, upper and lower.  In each workout, you feel the burn and know exactly which muscles are being worked.  If you are a beginner, don't over do it.  Work yourself into it.  There, as with all of the workouts in the program, is a modified version for beginners.  If you are looking for a workout program that guarantee visible results, be sure to add this one to your list.  It is definitely worth it's weight in gold.",1075334400,9,827,4.673611111111111
1850480,5,B00008LE01,This is a great exercise video.  Jen takes you through a challenging workout that slims and scuplts all the right parts of the lower and upper body.  It can be intnese but she does recommend that if weights are too heavy for any portion to lighten them or use none at all and follow the modiifed versions with Libby.  I love the leg press and the stretches in this video.  They have slimmed my legs and have helped me to drop 4 dress sizes in one month and a half.  The Firm gaurantees visible results in 10 workouts and i have it.,1062374400,21,531,4.166666666666667
1850499,5,B00008LE01,"I first got this as a VHS tape in the early 2000's. It was part of a 3-tape set, but this was the only one I continued to use after the first few viewings. I used it 3x/week for a couple of years, and along with jogging on my treadmill and careful (but not deprivational) eating, lost 30 pounds in about 6-7 months. I was in my early 30's and while short (5'2""), was not huge to begin with - I went from 140 to 110 and looking super toned and HOT! The last 10+ years I completely fell off the wagon in all areas and have tried different things to get me motivated. I got up to just over 160 at one point, more than ever! I tried boot camps, putting together my own workouts, getting a gym buddy, group classes, you name it. Finally, as another reviewer stated, I figured I would get back to what worked for me before. I've been doing it for about a month and a half now, and while it took 4-5 days to get over the first run through (even with no weights!), I'm back to being able to do it every other day and even using moderate weights for most of it. I agree with a couple of other reviewers on some things: there is a lot of stretching. It's probably about 30 minutes of weight work and 17 minutes of stretching spread out over 3 different points. This is one of the things that made me resist going back to it - I felt sure I could get a similar workout in 30 minutes. But I'm one of those people that apparently needs someone telling me what to do, and if I just stop freaking out about the time it takes, I actually enjoy the stretching. Plus being in my mid-40's now, it's probably more important for me to stretch than ever to avoid injury. I also apparently need the fewest possible steps / shortest time between getting home from work and getting started, because I love not having to leave the house. Another thing I agree with another reviewer on is that it is somewhat complicated and takes several viewings to learn the choreography. But I look at this as a good thing - it would be too boring otherwise! Also, Jen's timing is perfect if you understand how instructors call upcoming moves in advance, so also probably potentially confusing for an absolute newbie. I've done this tape so many times by now that I can almost do it without even playing it. I certainly don't have to look at it anymore. But looking at Jen and her amazing body that she has earned through hard work is motivating! My husband even knows all the songs, and we talk about Jen Carman like a member of the family!",1484179200,3,2501,4.223382045929019

1850501,5,B00008LE01,"I enjoy working out to this that I originally bought it when it first came out in video tape, I know old school, but with time it got damaged. So I was so happy to find it in DVD and excited to get back on track with my fitness goals.",1477353600,,234,3.7
1850502,5,B00008LE01,"I first purchased this video in a VHS format when I was a teenager. I am 30 yo now, and I still find it effective, challenging, fun, and everything in between.

1. THE SET
It is filmed in a nice looking set. Very clean and organized.

2. THE TRAINERS
All three of them are very well coordinated. You can tell that they practiced these routines over and over again and did not leave anything to imagination. So everything is done according to a well designed plan.

3. THE WORKOUTS
The workouts include a warm up, which is a plus since we don't want to start working out a cold body. The workouts themselves are very well coordinated, they are effective and challenging. I love how they go from a to b and there is an order to everything.

I strongly recommend this program to anyone looking to improve their health and fitness.",1472169600,,827,4.421052631578948
1850503,5,B00008LE01,"Anyone who is interested in this program may not know that this is the second of a 3 DISC'S EXERCISE PROGRAM. If TONING is what is wanted or mostly needed, this is the one to go for. Familiar Face JENNIFER CARMAN is the ""LEAD INSTRUCTOR"", WITH THE SAME INSTRUCTORS WHO WERE ON ""CARDIO SCULPT"". And as before, the exercisers are instructed to follow LIBBY FOR MODIFICATION.

This Program isn't as strenuous as ""CARDIO SCULPT"" is. I must say that I prefer this Program to ""CARDIO SCULPT"", though it does partner up with it perfectly. And this PROGRAM IS NOT AEROBIC. This is why it goes so PERFECTLY WITH CARDIO SCULPT. Originally there was a ROTATION CHART when this was purchased as a set, and I haven't a clue what happened to mine. One of my ""ROTATION IDEAS"" is to rotate this program  with ""AB SCULPT"" and maybe a half hour Dance or Walking Program. Either way, I'm not going over an hour. Another idea is to rotate this program with ""BODY SCULPT"". But it works out great. JENNIFER CARMAN WAS THE LEAD INSTUCTOR ON ANOTHER ""FIRM EXERCISE PROGRAM"" titled ""BETTER BODY AND BUNS"", which was when I first remembered her.

JENNIFER'S INSTRUCTIONS are clear, as she carefully lead the exercisers on their way to a better fit body. She seems to enjoy being a ""MASTER INSTRUCTOR"". Though I owned this Program before, I read some of the reviews. I was surprised when someone actually said this program did not work for her. I'm just wondering how could anyone use this program and not noticed any Toning, Firming, some Slimming or even any Muscle Building! I don't know if the ""GUARANTEED VISIBLE RESULTS IN 10 WORKOUTS!"", IS STILL IN EFFECT. BUT NOBODY IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE ""JENNIFER"", ""ALLY"", ""LISA"", ""CHRISTA"" OR ""LIBBY"" IN JUST TEN WORKOUTS. I think that it was REFERRING TO WHAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. NO ONE IS GOING TO HAVE AN HOURGLASS FIGURE IN JUST 10 WORKOUTS: FLAT TUMMY, SLENDER JIGGLE FREE THIGHS, FIRMER UPLIFTED BEHIND, AND SEXY ARMS AND SHOULDERS. Even if a person doesn't change their diet and still eat horribly, like I do, they should still see some results. NOTHING FROM NOTHING LEAVES NOTHING. IF YOU DO NOTHING, NOTHING WILL HAPPEN. YOU HAVE TO PUT IN FULL EFFORT TO GET BETTER RESULTS. I ALWAYS HAVE TO PUT IN AT SIX GOOD MONTHS TO GET BETTER RESULTS. OF COURSE I GET SOME RESULTS FROM CONSTANT USE FOR AWHILE. I bought this because it is part of a 3 Discs Exercise Program, that I had years ago. I was at a Local Wal*Mart and I saw THE TWO PART FANNY LIFTER, WHICH INCLUDED THIS ENTIRE PROGRAM, EXCEPT ON ""VHS"". I still have the ""VHS"" PROGRAM, FACTORY SEALED. Maybe I'll sell it. This was around the time I came across THE FIRM: BODY SCULPTING SYSTEM 2. I bought that too.",1468886400,5,2690,4.565217391304348

1850505,1,B00008LE01,"First of all, if you don't have a Firm Fanny Lifter this workout is really hard to do.  I substituted a regular stepper, and also a footstool.  It was a royal pain.  Plus, even with the Fanny Lifter, which has 2 pieces, you are instructed to constantly alternate between using one or the other piece of different heights.  But, anyway, regardless of all that, there is too much talking and maneuvering, and not enough of a workout.  I wanted to stop using this dvd after 5 minutes - it just seemed lame, but I made myself continue for a total of 20 minutes.  At that point, I still wasn't sweating and didn't feel worked out at all.  It was pointless to continue and a waste of time, so I popped in a different exercise dvd to complete my daily workout, which I do for around 1 hour.  And then I was sweating, working hard, out of breath and enjoying myself!",1467158400,,858,4.31875

1850556,5,B00008LE01,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,7,1486,4.427007299270073

I ordered this because my VHS version will not play yes I still have VHS versions of thing don't laugh. Working out in the winter in the Midwest can be a challeng I am not hard core enough to jog/ bicycle in sub zero freezing Chicago cold. Add kids and budget and time and will almost never get to the gym. So you need a good and reliable stack of workout tapes that will force you into shape but not take half the day doing it.  (P90X with a 45 minute workout are you serious? I have don't have all day to workout!) That is why I always go back to the Firm. That said  I noticed now that this is for someone with workout expecience.  If you have never worked out before this would be confusing .  My sister an aerobics novice and finds this overwhelming. The pace is fast and you better know what a grapevine is because they are not going to explain it to you.  The calling and the moves are sometimes off.  I'm no rythm queen but I get thrown off at times by the moves and the way she calls them.  Maybe it's me but this said it is not so off that you can not complete the workout which is challenging and that is best thing about this workout.  The moves are basic and it works your whole body and the dvd can be done half upper body and half lower so no all day workout  and it takes a while to outgrown this workout. Again not for newbies to working out cause the pace is fast but for those of us that have falling off the workout wagon and want to get back into shape. This is great.,1357430400,2,1621,4.0

This is a good workout. Started it on Monday and still sore, could only do it the Monday and probably won't start again until next Monday.

1850657,5,B00008LE01,"This is a great toning workout.  I run 30-55 miles per week and use multiple Firm and P90X workouts 2-3 times per week.  As I stated in other Firm reviews, Firm instructors are like personal trainers, not cheerleaders.  I like efficient workouts and these deliver.  If you want fun and entertaining, Firm workouts probably aren't for you.  If you want a gym-quality workout at home, The Firm (and P90X) will meet your needs.  After this one, I can feel it the next day.  You can adjust it to your level and progress by decreasing/increasing weights and by adjusting the depths of your squats and lunges.  Jen and  Allie (this Firm workout), and Allison and Rebekah (other Firm workouts - Bootcamp and Get Chisled) are all great Firm Instructors.",1337817600,4,745,4.7578125

1850659,4,B00008LE01,"I have accumulated a number of workout videos and dvds including Jillian Michaels, 10 minute solutions and Beachbody. I had the Firm Body Sculpting one about 10 years ago in VHS format and really liked it then. I got noticable results within weeks by doing it 3-4 days/week.

I lost my original copy somewhere along the time of switching from VHS to DVD and had been using other dvd's when I decided to look for this one in dvd form. It's back to being my favorite now! I switch between the upper and lower body workouts and use this 3-4 days/week before going to work. I highly recommend this workout.

Be sure to get the 'fanny lifter' or a similar stackable step system. You'll need an 8"" step and a 4"" step that are study enough to stay in place when stacked on each other and a set of dumbells: 2x3lb, 2x5lb and 2x8lb. If you really want to challenge yourself you might try 2x10lbs too, Jen Carman who leads this workout uses 10's and she's ripped!

Hairstyles are a bit dated but it's no real distraction. Use this one regularly and you will get a tighter everything!",1303344000,5,1073,4.409090909090909
1850660,5,B00008LE01,"What I love about this workout is its steady pace and non-chatter. The dialogue is forcused solely on the workout and makes me feel like I can concentrate on what I'm doing. No fluffy talk - just pure training. Jen is a really good instructor and reminds you of proper form to keep you on track.

To those who are out of shape - I did the following modifications with great results and NEVER got sore!

- Do a Firm workout only every other day - always skip a day for muscle repair.
- Do NOT use the full box for fanny lifting!! Start with the purple segment.
- Then as you're able, progress to the blue segment. Eventually, you'll be able to use the full box.

They do not show these modifications in the video, but they really should. Stepping up on that fanny lifter for 16 reps is TOUGH and used to discourage me greatly until I realized I could use a smaller segment - duh!  The beauty of the fanny lifter is that it's in two segments and allows you to build up to it.

I think this is a fantastic workout and disagree with the review that bashes all the stretching. Stretching the muscles that you just worked keeps them from getting too sore and makes them long and lean.  I love it.",1300233600,7,1190,4.220264317180617

1850693,4,B00008LE01,"I have done many, many firm workouts. I really like how this one is broken down so you can do it in sections or the entire workout at one time.  You can choose upper body or lower body and go directly to the workout. What I find annoying is the plastered-on smile and constant need to flash cleavage at a predominantly female audience.  This particular instructor gives some very helpful tips on proper execution of the movements, but is especially guilty in the annoying display of cleaveage.
If those factors don't bother you, you will enjoy the workout.",1199750400,2,556,4.663265306122449
1850694,3,B00008LE01,"Body Sculpt is from The Firm's Body Sculpting System 1 and is led by Jen Carmen; there are four background exercisers, one of whom shows beginner modifications. The 48-minute workout uses the Firm Fanny Lifter, which is a tall box that can be set at three different heights, and three sets of dumbbells.

The workout begins with a 6-minute warm-up which includes standard Firm moves such as squats, body waves, grapevines, knee ups, and moving stretches. Next comes the 15-minute lower body section. Jen uses heavy weights throughout this segment (I used 10#), and it is tough! She completely exhausts one side of the body before moving to the other. You do squats, lunges on one side, plie squats, lunges on the other leg, dips off the Fanny Lifter, hover squats (adding a 3-count hold), leg press on the Fanny Lifter (same leg), side squat onto the low step, repeat Fanny Lifter work on other leg, squat with abduction, side squat on the other side. One thing that I didn't like here is that you are doing a lot of disassembling/reassembling of the Fanny Lifter throughout the sequence.

Following the lower body work, there is a 5.5 minute segment which includes stretches for the lower body and warm-ups for the upper body, including both stretches and two sets of push-ups on the short step. Next comes 15 minutes of upper body work. Here Jen uses two sets of weights, medium and light. Beginning seated on the Fanny Lifter, she does a row, a bicep curl, and a row with a twist. She then does push-ups with hands on the Fanny Lifter, clean & press, and single French press. Returning to a seated position, she does several shoulder moves and a double French press. Next, Jen has you lie with your torso over the Fanny Lifter (I found this uncomfortable) for tricep kickbacks and additional shoulder work, and finally, she moves to the floor for chest press and pectoral flies. The workout finishes with a 5-minute stretch for all major muscles groups, coming in right at 47.5 minutes.

Overall, this is a solid full-body workout. For the lower body in particular, Jen accomplishes a lot in a short amount of time, but I felt that the intensity of the upper body work did not match that of the lower body. When working the arms, Jen frequently alternated sides; this would've been fine if she was using heavy weights, but since she wasn't, I made the upper body exercises harder by working both of my arms at the same time. Furthermore, although the upper and lower body portions are quick and efficient, there seems to be a lot of wasted time in this workout. Not only did the warm-up feel a bit too long to me, but also the stretch sequence between the lower and upper body workouts felt completely unnecessary. One example of wasting time is that you do a basic triceps stretch at FOUR separate times during this workout: during the warm-up, during the middle stretch, during the upper body portion, and during the cool-down. For a workout that does not include abdominals, this just seemed too long; I would've preferred 40-45 minutes. Finally, fans of The Firm's aerobic weight training style may be disappointed that there are no cardio segments in this workout (although my heart rate did stay in my target zone for about 20 minutes, mostly during the lower body portion).

This is definitely a decent strength training video that's probably best-suited for advanced beginners-to-intermediates. If you like The Firm's strength workouts and enjoy Jen's style, then I would recommend the workout and give it about 3 1/2 stars.",1184630400,19,3535,4.771241830065359
1850695,5,B00008LE01,"This is an extremely challenging workout in terms of lower body work. Format: Warmup, Lower Body Work, Cooldown for Lower/Warm up for Upper, Upper Body Work, Cooldown. The DVD allows you to select lower, upper, or both. Equipment called for: The Fanny Lifter, dumbbells. You could also use The FIRM Box or the TransFirmer. If you have a regular step, you can use it with a little creativity, no problem.

As others have noted, you need some kind of step for basically ALL The FIRM workouts, plus your dumbbells. Some FIRM workouts also require a Sculpting Stick. There is truly no need to expect to participate fully in The FIRM workouts without your box (or step or whatever you have).

Here's some helpful hints: All body sculpting systems (BSS) from The FIRM require dumbbells. BSS1 requires The Fanny Lifter. BSS2 requires The Fanny Lifter and Sculpting Stick. BSS3 requires The FIRM Box. BSS4 requires The TransFirmer.

Some of The FIRM workouts will work just fine with a regular Step, others won't. Just be aware that you may not be able to fully participate without the proper equipment. I will say this about The FIRM: Even though they require you to purchase their equipment, you can use the equipment for years to come. Plus, the packages are not that expensive, they usually come with 3 or more workouts, and the old stuff is on sale on their website. And, they usually let you pay with two payments instead of one. Not bad.

I love The FIRM. I've lost over 50 pounds of my pregnancy weight with these no-nonsense, effecient workouts. These workouts are challenging guys. They get results, so I'm willing to spend a few extra bucks on their equipment because these workouts WORK. I've noticed a definite change in my muscle tone, energy level, and stamina. Like everything else in life, this works if you work it. Good luck, everyone",1143158400,19,1845,4.75625

The  upper body was hard (I didn't think it was as hard as the lower body though), with the push-ups killing me every time.  I forgot how much I enjoyed this workout in the past.  I will definitely add to my rotation.  I had the VHS version, but I'm glad it's on DVD now.

I've always had good upper body strength, so that part was tough, but I made it through, but seriously, I could not walk down my stairs after the lower body portion, and I did not do all of it. I drink more water working out to my Firm DVD's than I do when I run four miles on my treadmill, 12 ,minute miles. Great Value. It's like having a personal trainer. ALso recommend Cardio Scultp. These Firm dvd's use circuit training to get you in shape. Non stop going, no rest in between except when you have to change your fanny lifter or get a new set of weights.

I am just now progressing from my physical therapy into a more ""normal"" workout regimen after herneating a disk in my lower back last year and thought this video would be a nice compliment to my elliptical workouts.  While I thought the lower body workout was solid, I thought the upper body workout was mediocre.  And I was disappointed in the abdominal exercises.  I thought it was bad form to encourage beginners to hold on to the back of the legs for crunches.

Most of all, I would not recommend this workout for anyone who has experienced a major back injury in the past.  I followed all of the instructor's directions for beginners and am currently in the most back pain I have experienced since last August.",1117411200,6,754,4.548148148148148

1850700,4,B00008LE01,"This is the hardest Firm strength video I own.  It is divided into 2 parts, lower and upper body, there are no abs in it though which is fine with me as I am usually wiped out by the end.  You will need the Fanny Lifter or a step or stool and assorted dumbells, such as 3,5 & 8 pounders.

The lower body portion is first, nice to get it out of the way.  It consists of a couple set of squats one of which is hover squats, 2 sets of leg presses for each leg (16 reps), a long set of lunges and dips with count variation such as pulses and 4 count, plie squats, some side lunges which aren't seen often in videos, and a killer set of squats/leg abductions which don't sound hard but they are.  I think they are the hardest part of the lower body section.  Then it's time for a well deserved cool down/stretch.  The upper body section is next, not quite as hard as the lower body but it is still thorough in hitting all the muscle groups.  You will work the biceps with traditional and hammer curls, triceps with french presses and kickbacks, chest with bench press, pec flies and pushups. 2 sets of double arm rows for the back, and some tough shoulder work, front and side raises plus military presses and rear delt work.

This workout is led by Jen Carmen, you can always count on her for a tough workout.  She is joined by 4 fellow Firm Master Instructors including Libby who shows beginner modifications.  Jen does a good job leading and you can tell they are all working hard along with you.  If you are up for a challenge this workout is for you.",1110067200,28,1550,4.199324324324325
