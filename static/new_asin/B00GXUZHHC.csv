BUT I have to say, it is intense and each Ab Workout on the DVD shows the basic, medium and most challenging ways to perform the exercises.

My husband was so impressed after just 7 days of me using the DVD (2 inches lost) He started doing them too!

I highly recommend this to both beginners and expert exercisers. Regardless of your exercise level, I know you have never had an Ab Workout like this! It is awesome!",1389571200,,578,4.106194690265487
6123805,5,B00GXUZHHC,"I love these quick effective ab workouts! As a busy mom of two, time is of the essence. I love that I can throw in the DVD and kill my abs during nap time in my own house!",1389484800,,171,3.526315789473684
6123806,5,B00GXUZHHC,"This DVD is a comprehensive ab workout that doesn't leave ONE area of your midsection out! They are super challenging workouts; however, they can certainly be modified to your fitness level. I like that they are short and sweet. Anyone has time to spend 10-14 minutes. After I do a workout, I can 'feel the burn' for days.....I like feeling the effects because I know it is working. Thank you for this great DVD. I hope to see another DVD in the near future for variety.",1389484800,,470,4.476744186046512
6123807,5,B00GXUZHHC,"Thank you, Fitz Koehler, for making a core workout that is fun, fast and very effective! Flip Flop ABS challenges my whole core, not just my stubborn abs, so its a perfect mini-workout when I am too busy to hit the gym. Fitzs great sense of humor make the workouts entertaining, plus she and her cast of athletes are super fit and very inspiring to watch. I would definitely recommend Flip Flop ABS to anyone who wants a sexy middle and is ready to work for it!",1388275200,,461,4.310344827586207
6123808,5,B00GXUZHHC,"Thank you Fitz for making a fun and effective work out. I love the variety of work outs. It keeps things more interesting. I also love that they are short, and they work out more than just your abs! My lower back is really weak, and your exercises will really help rebuild my strength after having a rough pregnancy. I am already seeing a difference after a week. When can we get a hips and butt exercise?? :)",1388275200,,409,4.256410256410256

8628537,5,B00GXUZHHC,"Why haven't I written a review for this brilliant DVD sooner? Hands down the best/toughest/innovative abs and core workout! Fitz has a wonderful personality and is joined by major athletes. I've done so many core DVDs (Cathe, P90X, you get the picture) and this is the best!
Be sure to check out her web page: FITZNESS.com
Dear Fitz, please give us more DVDs! Maybe an Upper Body and Lower Body Split. Whatever you film, I'll buy!",1468886400,,430,4.671052631578948
8628538,5,B00GXUZHHC,"Awesome, no nonsense ab workout. My 8 year old wants a ""six pack"". So, we do 1 of the 3 workouts every night. Worth every penny.",1406073600,,128,3.9615384615384617
8628539,5,B00GXUZHHC,"This is a great, quick, intense work out that you can squeeze into your day no matter how busy you are.  Even the kids are trying it out and felt the burn after just one workout.",1395360000,,178,3.9444444444444446
8628540,5,B00GXUZHHC,Have done all three of the ab workouts and loved them!  You can really feel these 15 minutes working exactly where they need to! And because they are only 15 minutes you can do them anywhere and anytime.,1395014400,,203,4.342105263157895
8628541,5,B00GXUZHHC,"Flip Flop Abs is by far, the most intense ab workout I've ever experienced. As an exercise physiologist, I've done more than my share of core training and this was beyond anything I'd ever experienced before. Yes, it's incredibly challenging and it left my abs and core totally spent.  It's also one of the most creative training program I've ever found which makes it great for both beginners and elite athletes.
 Loved it!",1390262400,,424,4.794520547945205
8628542,5,B00GXUZHHC,"I've trained with Fitz in person and know just how hard she can make you work. I was pleased that she gets the same intensity (and the same goofiness) across in her DVD! I wrote a longer review on Fit Bottomed Girls, but if you've checked out Fitz's site and dig her there, it's a good bet you're going to like the DVD. Just remember, there's nothing wrong with needing to build up to doing it all -- it's a toughy!

8628543,5,B00GXUZHHC,"I don't have a lot of time to devote daily, but I do try to do something.  What I like about this DVD is that in 15 minutes my abs can get a great workout and I'm shaking at the end.  Came home from work tonight and voila!  15 minutes later my abs are  screaming!  Can't wait for Fitz to come out with a workout for the rest of the body!",1389657600,,337,3.6901408450704225
8628544,5,B00GXUZHHC,"Flip Flop Abs is a great addition to my workout schedule. It is for serious athletes who want to improve their core strength. As an ultra marathon runner, kick boxer and backpacking enthusiast, I highly recommend this excellent DVD to everyone!! Fitz is hardcore!!",1389571200,,264,5.0227272727272725
8628545,5,B00GXUZHHC,"I don't have time to get to the gym on a regular basis and pretty much just try and walk.  Walking is great but some parts of your body don't get the workout necessary.  I have been using Fitz Kohler's Flip Flop abs for a few weeks now and Absolutely LOVE it!!!  I have a repaired knee and shoulder and was a bit worried that some of the shoulder exercises would be too much.  Not at all.  As a matter of fact my shoulder is feeling much better since beginning the AB routine.  It's fun, you'll enjoy it...don't hesitate...just DO IT!!!!",1389571200,,537,4.267326732673268
