Although not great for a simpsons episode  there is the trouble with trillions which is still worth watching, but ever  since it came out in 1999 my favorite episode is Marge Simpson in:  Screaming Yellow Honkers.",967680000,3,390,4.579710144927536
7895630,4,6305809178,"I have been a fan of Simpsons for a long time, and to this day ""I love Lisa"" is one of my favorite episodes. I love the scene where the ice cream gets spilled on Lisa at the Krusty show and then it show Bart  showing Lisa ""the exact moment Ralphs heart breaks"". ""The  trouble with trillions"" isn't exactly a classic, but it is more then  watchable. It has its moments. Give the video a shot.",960681600,,391,4.118421052631579
