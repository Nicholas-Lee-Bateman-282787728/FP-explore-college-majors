5677656,5,B00BVE3YU2,The product is great and came before time love this product it was the best movie I have seen a while.,1393718400,,102,3.9047619047619047
5677657,1,B00BVE3YU2,"No... Literally, she does it all in this movie. From acting to directing to music, Tangi owns this mess! Where else could you find a movie that plays random snippets of R&B music that have nothing to do with the plot and seemingly appear and disappear out of nowhere?!
We get it - psycho woman goes after her man. Blah, blah, blah it's been done before, BUT never as poorly as in this gem of a movie! This movie would not be suitable for Lifetime or the Hallmark Channel. In fact, it's better suited as a punishment for terrorists. If you've read a positive review of this movie, the reviewer was either friends with Tangi Miller or just yet another one of the many roles she plays for this low budget disgrace. Save yourself the agony of sitting through this trash. It horrendous.",1377820800,,781,4.468531468531468
5677658,5,B00BVE3YU2,"I rented this from Redbox (who for some reason listed it under horror, I'm a horror addict). The subcategory was misleading. The budding love affair predictable. The suspense nonexistant. Y 5 stars?

Because those things it lacked in wasn't the grounds on this movie sucking. Simply put its a drama thriller with a few plot holes, eye candy and ok acting.

Tangi miller is always ok in her roles. I totally believed her as a psycho. Her popping up at places she shouldnt have been proved that. The kuality is on point. The ending was somewhat ok and she was apprehended easily. I can see a part 2 come from this (i hope so).",1374537600,,624,4.464912280701754
5677659,1,B00BVE3YU2,"No No No No! Badly written, bad acting, bad music. How in the world did they get the woman from girlfriends to play on this movie is beyond me but no. It looks like it was recorded by a 1st year in college film student with no idea how to work a camera and that was me being generous. This was low budget I get that I mean the idea was good, but it was executed poorly. Really not worth a watch unless you can forgive the quality of the movie over all and just watch for the story of the movie itself but even then just no!",1367280000,2,523,3.8518518518518516
5677660,2,B00BVE3YU2,"This film was originally released under the title ""Guardian of Eden."" It was a play on words as the young girl in the film had the name of Eden (Jasmine Gyandoh). Michael (David Ramsay) while out with his buddies meets Kimmy (Tangi Miller) who used to be the fat chick nicknamed ""Jelly Roll."" She is ""fine"" now and crushing on Michael. After their one night stand, Michael, a married man with an expecting wife (Persia White) wants nothing more than to forget Kimmy. But Kimmy has other plans.

We have seen the psychotic girl friend movie before, done from a number of different angles with top named stars. This one offered nothing new. The acting was bland. The dialouge was boring and the plot never moved.

What I liked about the film was the opening credits and theme music. They should have done 90 minutes of that instead. IMDB lists this film as a ""romance"" while Redbox has it under ""horror."" It was neither, just a me-too drama.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. One sex scene.",1367107200,2,993,4.598870056497175
5677661,1,B00BVE3YU2,"The only conclusion I can draw about the other reviews is that they are friends with the director! This was a total waste of time out of my life. The Film is below budget and is very predictable. There is no creativity to this film. Additionally, it is not consistent. The character supposedly resides in this beautiful home, however, when filming in the home it appears to be an apartment. Additionally, some of the incidents are inconsistent. How can you be working a double and be at your mothers home simultaneously??-- it was just a mess!!!",1365897600,2,545,4.6875
5677662,4,B00BVE3YU2,"The wife rented this movie from Redbox and wanted me to watch it with her. At first, I was not interested because I thought it was just another low budget flick and before she hit play I was dosing off. While the movie was on I managed to lift my head and was up for the entire flick. The chick in the movie was crazy! She was so crazy she kept me awake anticipating her action. So, I recommend this fellas cause this is a real obsessed/stalker drama!",1365033600,4,451,4.136363636363637
5677663,5,B00BVE3YU2,Tangi Miller played the other women and made the movie a thriller! Awesome! I will recommend this thriller to other people! Great cast!,1363564800,,135,4.913043478260869
5677664,2,B00BVE3YU2,"I tried to like it. The script is bad, the sets are bad. Two stars because the acting is 2 star decent. It had the potential to be really good, but the ending is rushed and stuff is just chaotic and unprovoked.",1522713600,2,210,4.023809523809524

5677667,3,B00BVE3YU2,"I love the plot, the actors. It was suspenseful, but the music was horrible. They played it throughout the movie and it was very distracting because the singing sounded like amateur karaoke.",1521849600,,190,4.96875
5677668,3,B00BVE3YU2,It was ok. The editing in some scenes were pretty bad. The storyline was decent enough to keep my attention.,1521849600,,108,4.45
5677669,3,B00BVE3YU2,What happened at the end. The movie just cut off.  The movie was good but I do not like the way it ended.,1521763200,,105,3.5652173913043477
5677670,1,B00BVE3YU2,"O.K. First let me start by saying I try to give African American movies a chance but this one right here does not deserve a chance. So many parts skipped and you had to just fill them in with your own imagination. Good looking actors, but the story line was terrible and the music score was blah!!!! I wish I could take all my time back that I used it watching this under rated flick.",1521590400,,384,4.133333333333334

5677674,3,B00BVE3YU2,lol lol lol this chick is crazy not a bad movie the acting was ok and the storyline has been done before but still an okay watch,1518998400,,128,3.7777777777777777
5677675,5,B00BVE3YU2,"This film would be rated PG-13 for mature themes. It has two S words and one mild love making scene. The score could've been better. Nevertheless, this film kept my interest from beginning to the end. I cared for Miller's character. She desperately wanted love and affection and eventually she received it. Recommended for fans of romantic thrillers. I liked the fact that the film was a clean film with almost no profanity and no nudity. It's about an abused woman who had a terrible mother. She did what she had to do in order to keep the man that she loved. The male characters were immature and immoral. Sadly, most men act that way. Highly recommended.",1511827200,2,657,4.6239316239316235
5677676,4,B00BVE3YU2,"THE STORY-LINE HELD ME.  IT WAS REALISTIC....BUT IT DID SEEM LIKE A WHOLE LOT OF KILLING.
THE ACTORS WERE PROFESSIONAL AND GOOD LOOKING....WELL RECEIVED.  BELIEVABLE.
HOWEVER
THE PLOT STRAINED UPON DELIVERY.  IT WAS NOT TIGHTLY-EXECUTED.",1504915200,3,237,5.714285714285714
5677677,3,B00BVE3YU2,The movie was OK; that chick was C-R-A-Z-Y!,1499472000,,43,4.5
5677678,4,B00BVE3YU2,"I like this movie.

Kimmie (Tangi Miller) is a fine - used to be fat chick - who runs into an old high school mate Michael, whom she had/still has a crush on.

Michael who gave Kimmie the insulting ""Jelly Roll"" nickname in high school, now - finding Kimmy desirable - has a one-night-stand with her (in spite of being married).

I would call this movie a psycho-drama, as Kimmie's psychotic behavior takes over when Michael rebuffs her after her attempt to take their relationship beyond a regrettable affair (for Michael).

I think the acting is good (realistic, and not forced) by all of the actors.

The plot holds your interest as one can follow Kimmie's crazy behavior based on the subplot involving Kimmie's mother and step-father.

This movie reminds me of an episode of Snapped or Fatal Attraction where she gets away with the crime (for a time).

I found this movie better than some similar box office movies, both in the pacing and  acting.

The only thing I didn't like was the soundtrack played throughout the movie.

I would recommend it.",1475193600,5,1051,4.693989071038251

8574485,2,B00BVE3YU2,"The story developed way too fast.  I'm confused.  I feel like an hour and 13 mins is way too short for all that's happening in the movie.  How could they just brush over what had happen to the man's real wife?  Like most other reviews mentioned, the acting is decent.  The plot and the development appears very unorganized.  All together, it doesn't flow as well as I would want.",1527206400,,379,4.420289855072464

The basis of the story was decent but the flow was totally off. The sequences of flashbacks didn't really flow and left me wondering if it was a flashback or what was happening now.  I was totally taken aback and confused.",1524182400,,381,4.219178082191781
