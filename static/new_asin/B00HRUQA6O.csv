Well that's two down and eight more to go! Hopefully the whole series will be out by the end of next year! Thank you Revelation Films for making this release happen. I expected that the chances of LA LAW ever being released were nil.

6201275,5,B00HRUQA6O,"Once again, Shout Factory has graced with Season 2 of that classic 1980s TV series, 'L.A. Law', which I remember with great fondness from the 1980s as a teenager. The show, which chronicled the lives - and loves - of a group of lawyers at a downtown Los Angeles law firm - is considered a benchmark of 1980s TV, even now.

In season 2, new associate Jonathan Rollins (Blair Underwood), a new law graduate, joins McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney & Kuzak. He ruffled some feathers with some inappropriate statements during a TV appearance & clashed horns with Leland McKenzie for antics which benefited his clients, but caused unpleasant publicity (such as setting off fire alarms to prove another party was faking an injury). Rollins also went nose-to-nose with a sleazy financial advisor who bilked an elderly woman out of her savings, then kept the money for himself. In an unforgettable scene, Rollins raked the man over the coals in a cross-examination. This season also introduced us to 2 people who would become regulars; Benny Stulwicz (Larry Drake, in the role that would land him an Emmy) as a developmentally-delayed man who is hired by the firm as a messenger. Benny would stay with the series until its run ended in 1994. The other new face was Dave Meyer (Dann Florek, in a role that would later catapult him to a bigger & better role as NYPD Capt. Donald Cragen in 'Law and Order', and later, 'Law & Order: SVU'). Meyer was a thoroughly annoying presence throughout the series but he often appeared as a guest and not so much as a regular. In the courtroom, Victor clashed with Hamilton Scuyler, AKA 'Mighty Mouse', a pint-sized lawyer who resorted to unorthodox tactics & earned him the wrath of the judge. Kuzak found himself defending a sleazy celebrity on drug charges, then became furious when the sleazy client was re-arrested. Benny is arrested on sex charges and calls Arnie, who is not used to criminal trials and subsequently calls on Kuzak to assist in Benny's defense. Outside the courtroom, Stuart & Anne prepare for their upcoming nuptials, and Roxanne becomes involved with an ethically bankrupt stockbroker who uses inside information to score big earnings. Sadly for Roxanne, she finds herself caught up in the legal shenanigans.

Another great release of this marvelous series. Keep them coming, Shout Factory!",1436572800,,2335,4.908860759493671

6201309,5,B00HRUQA6O,La Law was one  of the  hit series during  the  years it aired . It had an excellent  cast  and  good stories.

6201328,2,B00HRUQA6O,"I am a TV on DVD reviewer and was very excited to start watching my review copy of ""Law"" S1 and even more excited to see S2 coming up so close; the pastel walls, consistent Miami Vice garb w/ huge shoulder pads, and disappointingly bad acting were all tough to see.

This is not to mention the weaker-than-recalled plots and less-attractive than remembered cast.

It seems that one is better off going with the ""Law and Order"" franchise,",1392249600,,437,4.589743589743589
6201329,3,B00HRUQA6O,"""L.A. Law"" was, in its day, one of the best-written dramas on TV, and its approach to legal issues is pretty much on target, even factoring in the bizarre trials that are, of necessity, the staple of any TV legal drama. I love re-watching the shows on DVD, almost enough to overlook two key problems. First, the video quality leaves a lot to be desired; surely the shows could be ""digitally remastered"" for better picture quality. And why are there no subtitles or captions? The show was closed-captioned in its original run; why is that function not on the DVD?",1390953600,3,562,4.63

6201331,1,B00HRUQA6O,"Are we reviewing the show or the misleading REGION 2 PAL on the packaging? Region 2 PAL is for the EUROPE area, NOT the USA and CANADA. Then, some ads say REGION FREE, BUT the DVD's & packaging say REGION 2 PAL. Then again, they DO work on my ordinary DVD player here in the USA. CONFUSING? YOU BET!! ONE star for the labeling and advertising & 4 stars for the show.",1378252800,4,366,4.097222222222222
6201332,5,B00HRUQA6O,I was concerned that season 2 would not play on my machine because other reviews about season 1 said they were having trouble making them play.  Season 2 played perfectly and I'm thrilled.  Haven't started season 3 yet.  Would like to order season 1 but am iffy on it due to the reviews.,1376092800,7,287,4.377358490566038

I have continued to check for its availability every month since and was delighted when Season 2 came out. While Amazon lists it as being a UK format, I contacted the seller and was assured that it would play on DVD players in the U.S.

My package arrived in just three days and I watched the first two episodes that night. No problem with the format and I am looking forward to watching some more episodes today -- March 24 -- my birthday!

Each episode runs over 48 minutes each for two episodes: one runs at over 45 minutes the other over 47. No special features. As with the 1st season, the transfer is extremely dusty, grainy, and oldie looking. It's as if this color show was made 50 years before. Great guest stars this season, including James Earl Jones, Ralph Bellamy, Constance Towers, Finola Hughes, and Conchata Ferrell who would become a cast member in the 90s.",1505088000,,508,4.784090909090909
8635064,3,B00HRUQA6O,"The show is okay, not outstanding.  I like the fact that shows in the 1990s were direct.  Of course, I can't say what the characters said on the show because we are too politically correct, but it seemed so real.  Bald guys, aging women, single guys, and so forth.  Today's tv only likes good looking young characters UNLESS the character is going to be an extra on the show.  For example, on a major show now, the bald guy is the extra and always turns out to be the killer or the detective.  In the 90s, a bar guy could actually be lead on a show.  In the 90's, Roseanne (a fat actress) was lead on a show.  I am sure there are some fat leads now, but I don't recall them by name.",1489881600,,682,4.037313432835821
