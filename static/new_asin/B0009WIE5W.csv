I was completely absorbed by the story and intrigued by the ghostly figures and other supernatural aspects of this often frightening film. Stay with the story because all the pieces fit together perfectly and the outcome is surprisingly touching and will stay with you for a long time. In addition, both Nos Miran and La Promesa have strong ties with the famous ghost story by Henry James, ""The Turn of the Screw.""  Highly recommended.",1272931200,4,565,5.01063829787234
8068300,3,B0009WIE5W,"This movie is not bad. It's a tad bit long. There really needs to be a tad bit more magic to this film to hold a candle to the likes of other films like ""The Others.""

The movie seemed to drag a bit for me. There were several instances where the movie overflowed with recumbency which also led to me checking my watch to know the time. Let's just say that if I'm enraptured by a great movie I don't pay any attention to my watch or the time.

The subtitles are also flashed on the screen at such a fast pace which makes for difficult reading. Luckily my Spanish comprehension skills are developed enough that it was actually easier for me simply to listen and not read. This is, however, not the case for everyone.

I wonder how well this movie has done here in the states since it is nearly seven years old and yet I'm the first person on amazon.com to review this movie. Hym...",1253318400,2,879,4.220238095238095
