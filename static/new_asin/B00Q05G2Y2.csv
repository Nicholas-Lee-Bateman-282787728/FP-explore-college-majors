I only purchase this due to fact i have all the other Ammittyvilles. This is a very cheesy take just usin title to spin off a  very low budget b movie. The house has windows similair to origional and 1 single fly buzzin round window. I thought ammittyville  asylum was bad enough but this one takes the cake hands down!!",1432857600,,497,4.450549450549451

I almost didn't make it through the whole movie, it was so bad. Wait for the next Amityville movie to come out. Skip this one. This movie has nothing to do with amityville.

6839427,3,B00Q05G2Y2,"Welcome to (a Reasonable Facsimile of) Amityville:
  A Review of Amityville Death House

 Whether Amityville Death House is a stand- alone feature that revolves itself around the infamous village where the Colonial abode that has become one of the most popular spirit infested places in America is an attempt at expanding the direction of The Amityville Horror franchise or is simply a film that wants to use the name to attract people into its web remains impossible to tell. In the beginning there are frequently vague indirect references to the place that was once located at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island (There is only one place in Amityville, one character states in the first reel in a bit of dialogue that perfectly evokes the coyness surrounding the way it links itself to the aforementioned residence) though not all of the movies in the series are in the house of the original the movie seems to be trying to directly link itself to the home in the original which poses my question. Also, we get two quick scenes involving the swarms of flies easily associated with both the home and the previous entries in the series but nothing so showy as, arguably the originals most famous bit, the blood oozing from the walls. The look of the place where the leading lady ,Tiffany, (played in a stiff, mechanical, one-note fashion by Krysten St. Pierre) and her friends stay (the bulk of the mid-section gives them nothing else to do but drink beer, sit on a couch and obliviously thumb through pages of an ancient, well-worn book where they learn vital plot details) to check on her aging grandmother who lingers in her bed the entire duration in various stages of possession and facial decay (which comes off as looking like a Lucio Fulci rendition of Reagans appearance in The Exorcist),  bears an uncanny resemblance to The Amityville Horror home, the interior is relatively similar, but its not exactly an exact mock-up. Such is a fitting symbol for how the rest of the film feels, and the reason of my uncertainty where exactly it lies in The Amityville cannon.

  One thing it does get right is the rapid-fire pace of most of The Amityville films. The hauntings and eerie goings-on occur as soon as they step foot into the home and continue on in such a fashion for the rest of the feature. Like the entries in The Amityville franchise, it relies heavily on well-worn ghost story clichs (i.e. someone watching behind your shoulder, lights that turn themselves off by themselves and sudden sounds crashing from off screen) but it all gels together in an agreeably disproportionate manner.

  Because of the undeniable reality that these types of things are so far engraved in Horror culture that they evoke more familiarity and a sense of nostalgia than actual fright it works here because of how constantly they are utilized. You barely have any time to realize how often these devices have been used before something else is thrown your way. This is all in textbook Amityville fashion and because the film is so grainy and competently atmospheric (though never genuinely groundbreaking throughout) it works in the same excessive manner as the best entries in The Amityville series do. It also makes the question of the filmmakers true intentions to create another direct sequel to the wildly successful franchise, or try to increase interest by selling off the village name associated with the dwelling all the more intriguing.

  Wisely, and again adding to the previously addressed inquiry, is that the thin plot adds a vengeful witch using his craft (played by Eric Roberts in a performance where he is shown in mostly schlocky and laughable ways shouting random taunts and stating various quips that make the reality that simply heighten the fact he is enacting his wrath) to slaughter and alter the bodies of those who reside on or around the property the characters find themselves staying in. It works remarkably well, a fresh layer to the mythos of the franchise (again, if that is indeed what this is), that, like the hauntings in the interior of the home, have all been mostly done to death. Because of this the cinematic work simultaneously gives another manner to separate itself from the rest of The Amityville movies, a method to stand-out that blends perfectly with the spectral occurrences the main characters combat in the household.

  The special effects are also noteworthy. There is very little of the horrendous Computer Generated Imagery (outside of the previously mentioned scenes of the hovering flies) that plagues so many direct-to-video (and most major releases in general) outings as this. The gore effects are mostly believable, well-done and they summon back to mind the great cinematic terrors from the late 1970s and into the 1980s, when Amityville had reached the zenith of its popularity. For those of us who have a special inclination towards this series and find many of their favorite genre entries reside in this time period this is an extra special treat.

  At an extra tight 77 minutes the pace moves mainly like wildfire, it doesnt outstay its welcome, it wears its clichs like a comforting badge of honor and it carries a low budget likability and charm throughout. Simply put: this is a return to horror as a more enjoyable than scary, funhouse ride. The acting is mostly as stiff as a board, the characters are really archetypes meant to propel the plot through its few details to get to the ups and downs in the dark, but it does this without the constant cruelty, officious seriousness, false pretentiousness and unnecessary barbarity that wormed its way into too many current horror features. It also keeps the found footage aspect, the preposterous and too well-worn scenes of characters recording themselves to an absolute minimum (something that The Amityville Haunting  delighted in and, in turn, made it one of the weakest links in The Amityville chain), down to a few scenes which is especially welcome. Amityville Death House is fun, nothing more and nothing less. Its a perfectly suitable rental for a Friday night that sports mainly of the same imperfections fellow horror admirers have come to adore. Also, it keeps in touch with its roots and adds just enough new material and plot aspects to make it possibly the best entry in the franchise, if that is what this is, since the remake brought the series to a frustrating, all-time low with its inability to grasp and respect even the most fundamental plot points of the bestseller which sparked life into this expansive sequence of motion pictures. That may not be glowing praise, but for those of you like me who are tired of the repetition and direction horror films have been taking and need a new fix of the old days, its enough to recommend it as a return to form and a step in the right direction for the genre.",1426291200,5,6838,4.847341337907376

But Let Me Tell You, Neither Are in This Movie & I Am Most Disappointed !!!
- I Mean Eric Roberts Voice Cameo is in the Movie But You Never Really See Him & He Plays No Major Role.
He Might as Well Appear in the Movie Via Satellite or Web Cam for That Matter ...
And How Do We know That Really Even Him at All, Could Just Be a Voice Over But Either Way It Doesnt Add Up 2 Much of Nothing
The Only Reason to Get This Movie & All That Its Worth Now is Just to Laugh at as a Joke in Hindsight & as a Less Than B' Movie Collectable.

8689936,4,B00Q05G2Y2,"""Amityville Death House"" is a movie that revolves around the infamous village of Amityville, NY. I cannot tell if this movie is an attempt at The Amityville Horror franchise or if it's just a move that wants to use the name to sell. I've found in the beginning there are frequent vague and indirect references to the infamous house at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island (though not all of the Amityville movies in the series are in the house of the original).

There is one thing this movie does get right, and that's the fast pace of most of The Amityville films. The hauntings and all happen as soon as they step foot into the home and continue on in such a fashion for the rest of the movie. But most of what happens here is the same kind of stuff that happens in a lot of ghost stories.  New setting, new name, but kind of the same ol' stuff.  But in this case, I don't mind.

The special effects are decent. This is more of an independent film.  If you like the overly done computer-generated Hollywood effects, this movie is not for you.  But if you like independent movies and movies of a lower budget, I think you'll find this one enjoyable.  I think it was well worth the purchase and is worthy of sitting with the rest of the Amityville movies I have on my shelf.",1464220800,,1270,4.2887029288702925
8689937,1,B00Q05G2Y2,"It seems the Salem Witch (?) of Amityville was killed for ummm being a real witch. She curses the descendants of those that killed her. And apparently it is now time to kill them off. Eric Roberts reads from the limited edition ""Evil Dead"" DVD case that looks like a book as he flips cheap Rider Waite Tarot cards which causes the witch Abigail to enact her revenge which includes some college kids visiting grandma.

This is better than many of the Polonia films out there believe it or not. One of the aspects of Polonia films is to have long vehicle drives with tons of useless dialogue filler. They gave us a break on this one as the drive didn't consume the entire film only to end with a rubber head of a dinosaur.

The acting was bad, special effects needed help, and the plot didn't make a lot of sense. Eric Roberts phoned it in with one of the worse sinister laughs I have ever heard. What was that spider thing supposed to be?

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. I don't know who those women are on the front cover. No babes were filmed in the making of this movie.",1451260800,,1069,4.282178217821782
8689938,2,B00Q05G2Y2,"When movie fans watch movies like this we understand it will have bad acting, bad music, bad editing, bad story, bad special effects and bad cinematography. We watch these to find some delicious cheese and have fun and occasionally even discover a really cool movie. Fortunately I can cross this one of my movie bucket list so you don't have to. Just really boring with nothing to mention that's positive about the film. So all I can tell you is to not waste your time watching this.

8689940,4,B00Q05G2Y2,"The basic storyline of this addition to the AMITYVILLE series held promise, but the execution, unfortunately, is lacking.  Eric Roberts' face is never even shown, as he hides behind a mask the whole time, playing a kind of narrator from a netherworld.  The DVD cover art is as about as exciting as it gets, but as a fan of the AMITYVILLE series, it will still hold a place in it's lineage for me.  Worth a watch if you like cheesy horror movies and need to kill some time, but all others will want to move on.",1439769600,2,509,4.28125

8689944,1,B00Q05G2Y2,"If a digital video camera could have diarrhea, this would be the result. This sad excuse for a film, directed/produced by Mark Polonia (who, with his deceased brother John, made such SOV ""classics"" like SPLATTER FARM - 1987; FEEDERS - 1996; THE HOUSE THAT SCREAMED - 2000; and dozens others), written by John Oak Dalton (Polonia's PETER ROTTENTAIL - 2004) and executive produced by Fred Olen Ray through his company Retromedia Entertainment, is one of the worst developed films I have seen in quite a while. It is also so short in length that the opening is a highlight reel of the film's best moment (and by saying ""best"", I don't mean good) and the end credits crawl so slow, they last for ten minutes, making for a 77-minute film. Even at that short length, it still seemed like watching an 8-hour mini-series, but without much of a plot. Also, the film says Eric Roberts is the main star, but we NEVER see his face. We only hear his voice, while someone else plays him as a masked warlock sitting down at a table, in dialogue that could have been recorded in less than thirty minutes. It also has CGI that is so bad, a grade school kid can do better (if you are going to shoot a no-budget horror film, the least you can do is give your audience good old-fashioned practical effects, not CGI blood). After the highlight reel (which showcases one the few real practical effects, done by Brett Piper, director of such films as A NYMPHOID BARBARIAN IN DINOSAUR HELL - 1990 and BACTERIUM - 2007), we then see the masked warlock with Eric Roberts' voice, as he spouts gobblety-gook about a witch named Abigail Wilmont who was killed in the 1700's because she was a witch and now the warlock wants her to get revenge by killing five of the ancestors of those who murdered her, using the ""Book Of The Dead"" (actually Abigail's diary). We then switch to Tiffany (Krysten St. Pierre) and her three friends, Aric (Michael Merchant), Bree (Cassandra Hayes) and Dig (Houston Baker, who also composed and sings the film's closing tune), as they are coming back from helping people from the devastation of Hurricane Courtney (not even a real hurricane!). Tiffany and her friends are now going to Amityville to see her sick grandmother Florence (Yolie Canales) at the ""Old Wilmont Place"" and make sure she is OK. They are just about there when they see young woman Charlayne (Danielle Donahue) standing in the snow next to her car. The group stop and Aric fixes her car and then proceed to grandma's house. Charlayne lets her dog Snappy out of the car to do his business and when he doesn't return, she goes looking for him, where she finds a human skull in the snow and a noose hanging from a tree. She is then killed by her own dog (at least I think it was Snappy; the film is edited haphazardly) as we hear the warlock say, ""Five more must die before the dawn!"" (Wait a minute, didn't he say in the beginning that only five would die?). Tiffany and her friends make it to grandma's house (it's a plain house with two of the Amityville House's iconic windows added by obvious CGI!), only to find the outside of the house in disrepair (with an animal's skull on the stairs). Tiffany discovers her grandmother Florence (a really bad old-age makeup job) upstairs in bed babbling incoherently and Tiffany finds the Book Of The Dead on her night table and takes it. Fisherman Ernest (Todd Carpenter) is the second one to die when Abigail reaches from under the water and pulls him under. Sheriff McGrath (Kevin VanSant) just misses seeing this as he was talking to Ernest moments earlier before driving away. Squirrel hunter Wardell (Steve Diasparra) is the third to die when he discovers Abigail hanging from a tree and she rips his eyes out (in one of the film's few practical effects). Bree then cuts her hand on the Book Of The Dead and the infection spreads, while Tiffany reads a witches spell out loud from the book (I know it makes no sense. Nothing here does). Zeke (Jeff Kirkendall) & Gilly (Austin Dragovich), two local troublemakers, are the fourth and fifth victims when Abigail rips Gilly's head off (off-screen) and the film freezes when Abigail has her hands around Zeke's neck (I guess they didn't have anything in the budget to show either death). Things go crazy in Grandma's basement when Aric & Dig become possessed and try to drown Bree in a vat of water. They see that Tiffany has six breasts (another terrible effect) and Dig yells out ""She has the witch's teats!"" (WTF?!?). The possessed duo try to strangle Tiffany but she must have some sort of supernatural power, because both Dig and Aric snap out of it. The rotting Abigail scratches Dig's face as he plants an axe in her body and Aric finishes her off by crushing her head with his foot. Tiffany goes upstairs to destroy the Book Of The Dead, but she is met by her possessed Grannie. Tiffany manages to knock her head off with a few punches to Grannie's head (another terrible effect) and goes to the basement, where she starts tearing pages out of the book. She tells Aric that they must burn the pages to send Abigail's spirit to Hell (Wait a minute, wouldn't it be easier just to burn the book as a whole?), while Bree sprouts giant legs and turns into a spider (a combination of CGI, physical and Brett Piper's stop motion effects, which is the scene the film opened with, so it comes as no surprise at all!). Aric is killed by a scythe held by once-again possessed Dig and Tiffany sets fire to the pages, which causes the house to explode in mere seconds (in one of the worst CGI scenes I ever laid my eyes upon). We then cut to the Sheriff watching video from Tiffany's video camera, which was pulled out of the wreckage. He spots Abigail in some of the frames in the video when he gets a call from his ex-wife Veronica (Kathryn Sue Young) that Tiffany is at her store. But is it even Tiffany? Do you really care?  Director Mark Polonia (who also plays the Sheriff's deputy Sully) still hasn't learned to make a coherent film since he started out in the 80's. There is absolutely nothing to recommend here, even the spider transformation, which looks to have been done on the cheap and in a hurry. Polonia's over-reliance on dime-store CGI (a trait in Fred Olen Ray's softcore films that show on cable all the time) and Dalton's non-linear and confusing screenplay will give you a headache, as will all the actors' terrible thespian talents (yes, every one of them). Krysten St. Pierre is especially awful, as she only seems to have one expression and speaks her dialogue in monotone. Eric Roberts probably owed someone a favor or did the warlock voice for some quick booze or blow money. I have no idea why this film was even made, but do yourself a favor and just pass this one by. It really has nothing to do with Amityville and it is about a scary as a baby's dirty diaper. A Bayview Entertainment DVD Release. Not Rated.",1434499200,2,6897,4.553140096618358
