8472653,5,B005H45INI,Brilliant piece of art! As if Andy Warhol made a found footage horror film! Recommended for the strong performance by Mark McGerry.,1336608000,,131,5.0
8472654,1,B005H45INI,"This is not even a movie.  It is a scam to get money from people.  The whole video is comprised of some dumb, lunatic wannabe guy making faces, screaming, etc. in front of a video camera for an hour.  The people that sell this scam crap, lying and taking advantage of others should be made to shovel cow dung with their hands for about a week.  DO NOT buy this dvd!  I hate I even had to give it 1 star......maybe I can leave it blank.",1334534400,,435,4.011627906976744
8472655,2,B005H45INI,"continuous shot film of a guy going crazy that's pretty much it.
I thought you actually got to see him hunt down & kill his viewers but you don't sadly",1332374400,,151,4.066666666666666
8472656,5,B005H45INI,"YES! This movie is FINALLY available in the states. I saw it in Uruguay back in '94 right after it was first released. I said it then...""This will NEVER be shown in the states."" It only took them 17 years...but they've finally proved me wrong. And this country is all the better (or worse, you be the judge) for it. It's quite a shocking film. Interested to know what others think...  The ending is a WHOPPER!",1313452800,2,409,4.381578947368421
