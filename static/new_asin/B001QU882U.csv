8336404,5,B001QU882U,"Excellent documentary.  Jack Taylor was one of the last of the great ""bespoke"" providers of clothes to the stars.  Sadly, he and many of his famous clients who appear in the film have passed on since this was made about a decade ago.",1469836800,,233,4.395348837209302
8336405,4,B001QU882U,"Besides the celebrities Jack Taylor served over all those years, you get to meet some newer customers, such as a movie producer and a photographer, and their affection for Mr. Taylor shows through, while their insights add so much to the story.  This is a very well-made film, and the quotes are a clever way to learn more about how to run a successful business, as well as how to dress for success.",1373068800,,399,4.465753424657534
8336406,5,B001QU882U,"Easily one of my favorite documentaries in recent years, JACK TAYLOR OF BEVERLY HILLS is a great look at the last gasp of mens' tailoring in America.  The subject's disdain for off-the-rack, cheaply made suits is no secret... in fact, nothing the man thinks is ever really held back.  His charm, candor, and unapologetic devotion to quality and style make him, rightly, an icon.

Jack's the last of his breed.  Check out the doc, and while you're at it, get rid of that off the rack blazer that you can't close in the front anymore.  One viewing of this made me want to burn everything in my closet.",1322179200,,599,4.5092592592592595
8336407,5,B001QU882U,"If you're at all interested in mens fashion,  you'll love learning about Jack Taylor and his influence on Hollywood.  a gem of a movie.",1296000000,,135,4.583333333333333
