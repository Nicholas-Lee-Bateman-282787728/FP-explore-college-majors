8297964,4,B001EEKKQA,"Ok so these both are not the best Kung Fu movies ever created.  That said Revenge of the Lady Warrior (Alias ""Against The Drunken Cat Paws, I think that title is a better/more entertaining one)is one of my all-time favorites.  Partly because of Nora Kao Loa's acting and partly because it is a funny movie.  Drunken women fighting, kid fighting a midget, all of that and a typical revenge plot that is very easy to watch. I used to have this title under the Drunken Cat Paws Title on VHS and wish I had never gotten rid of it.  Brings back a lot of memories of watching this and other Kung Fu ""Classics"" with my kids on Saturdays (USA Kung Fu Theater).
The second movie is not as good as the first, acting is not as good, action is average, and the picture quality is not as good(Seems a little out of focus).  Both movies look like they were VHS originals copied into digital format.
Truthfully I only bought this for the first movie and based on that alone I would recommend this DVD.  Movies like this should be what they should be thinking of remaking instead of TV shows made into movies (Dukes of Hazard, Beverly Hillbillys, etc, etc).

Loved it!",1329177600,,1152,4.40566037735849

Is it a classic?  Definitely not, but if you can find this set for cheap, I'd say it's worth getting.",1277683200,,353,4.4
