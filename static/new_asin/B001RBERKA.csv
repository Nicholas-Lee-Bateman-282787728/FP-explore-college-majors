8337697,4,B001RBERKA,"This is a great video for the novice trainer to start on. It has a lot of information and is a well made video. I go back and watch it from time to time and make sure I am covering all the bases. Mike makes this training look easy, so be advised it may take a bit more work on your part to make things happen.
Mike trains his retrievers in the English hunting / retrieving style. Not that it is bad, just a bit different. The methods and reasons for doing things in a certian way are usually explained and they make sense.
This DVD is money well spent for most beginners. More advanced trainers may find it a bit over simplified.
On a scale of 1~10 i would give it an 8",1353628800,2,669,4.0
