2828525,5,B000PUBB3U,At my first wedding I was embarrassing on the dance floor.  I wasn't going to make that same mistake in my second.  This DVD made all the difference.  It was easy to follow and gave me the basic skills I needed to have confidence on the dance floor.  And it was fun learning with my fiance.  My friends noticed a huge difference.,1193184000,,329,4.241935483870968
2828526,5,B000PUBB3U,"Wow... money well spent! Not only did my fiance and I learn to dance in the privacy and comfort of our own living room, we had fun doing it. The clear and precise step-by-step instructions made the whole process easy. We went from clumsy and nervous to smooth and confident in just two viewings. Highly recommended!",1190073600,2,315,4.642857142857143
2828527,5,B000PUBB3U,This DVD is amazing!  It is easy to follow and beautiful to watch.  It made this part of my wedding preperation a synch and i plan on buying them as gifts for all my to be married friends!,1180396800,2,188,3.9210526315789473
8193514,4,B000PUBB3U,"The DVD is a wonderful primer for learning basics including lady turn-unders.  There are no specialty foot patterns, so don't expect to learn to samba or tango on this one.  But if you have not learned to dance yet or are teaching new learners, start here and then go on to the specialty dances on another DVD after this.",1440115200,,321,4.423728813559322
8193515,5,B000PUBB3U,"This is a great instructional video that covers the basics of dancing. I was skeptical of a video but decided to try it after reading the phenomenal reviews. It did not disappoint. Originally, I thought my partner and I would have to have a first dance with predetermined moves and steps but this DVD has allowed us to feel competent and confident. We practice once a week and are excited for the first dance at our wedding.",1426204800,,424,4.51948051948052
8193516,5,B000PUBB3U,These guys are great.  It's easy to follow and get you started.  We liked it as a great starting point.,1369612800,,103,4.1
8193517,5,B000PUBB3U,"This is the BEST learn to dance DVD, and not just for weddings! It works for everybody who wants to get on the dance floor! It is modern and simple and everything you need to learn in 90 easy minutes. Julee and her partner are the cutest dance instructors ever!",1360713600,,261,4.24
8193518,5,B000PUBB3U,"If you are not a 'dancer' but you don't want to look idiotic on the dance floor on your wedding day, this is unquestionably the best video to get...hands down. Face it; you're probably not going learn enough between now and your wedding day to earn you a spot on ""Dancing With The Stars"".  Trying to learn a whole bunch of ballroom steps just isn't practical for most people and I would venture to guess that 97% of your guests can't dance that stuff either.  At the end of the video you will have learned an easy to remember sequence of steps that will carry you through 3-4 minutes of music.  You can repeat the various moves in any order whenever you want to the rest of the night.  Good luck!",1256342400,,696,4.290076335877862
8193519,5,B000PUBB3U,"This is our second marriage, in middle age and a much anticipated community celebration and blended of families.  We appreciate having thorough and simple instruction from a personable, warm and welcoming couple (Julee and Dave).  It's a whole year away so we should be well prepared by then!  In the end, we get the skills to create our own ""dance"" together.",1247356800,,359,4.852459016393443
8193520,4,B000PUBB3U,We bought this video for the Mother son dance at my son's wedding. We had three practice sessions and totally pulled it off at the reception.,1247097600,,141,4.461538461538462
8193521,5,B000PUBB3U,A must have if you are about to get married.  Watched it 2 days before the big day and looked great out on the dance floor. BUY IT.,1230681600,,131,3.6785714285714284
8193522,2,B000PUBB3U,"This just wasn't for us. It is more if you want to learn ballroom dancing. Its not casual dancing at all, very formal. The instructors are okay, but they move kinda quick if you are a first timer with no experience. Not bad, just not for us!",1210896000,,241,4.148936170212766
8193523,4,B000PUBB3U,"I highly recommend this DVD if you need to prepare for your first dance. We started out having no idea how to dance and followed each step of this video. The dance moves were easy to follow and with practice we were able to do them naturally and with ease. We then practiced the moves with our song for a few nights before our wedding. The result was great! We did a wonderful first dance and received commments such as: ""Did you take dancing lessons?"". Not too much time is needed to practice, but we did it slowly, in 3 weeks a few minutes every night. Actually it was fun and romantic, and we made a really nice dance at our wedding. Afterwards, we used our moves and turns because we are now dance partners as well.",1209254400,4,719,4.255474452554744
