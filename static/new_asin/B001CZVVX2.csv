3521079,4,B001CZVVX2,"This production of Nutcracker is about Michail Chemiakin. He is a prominent painter who was expelled from USSR and spent most of his career in the USA. Perestroika and collapse of the Soviet Union allow him to work in Russia. The whole ballet design in his style and it's gorgeous.
Overall it's create very magical, festive ballet. Choreography is, probably, the weakest point of this production, but on occasion it is great (yes, Snowflakes, Arabian dance-coffee ).
Dancing is very, very good. I wish dancers have more choreography to work with. Gergiev conducting is on occasion rushed and glosses over intricacies of the score. Quality of recording and camera work is great. Bonus material is OK, very mildly informative.
This is an good Blu-ray for children, because it's so magical and for connoisseur es, because it's a well done new production.",1291766400,6,851,5.042553191489362
3521080,5,B001CZVVX2,"I cannot imagine a better Nutcracker than this. It is a delight from beginning to end. Wonderful sets, costumes, and superb dancing. The picture and sound quality are just wonderful. Do not hesitate. I personally prefer this to the recent San Francisco Blu ray but that is also pretty good but not as traditional as this production. I rate this as one of the best ballet discs in my collection.",1266278400,7,394,4.642857142857143
3521081,5,B001CZVVX2,"Some say that the music of a country is best performed by artists in that country and this brilliant effort supports that view.  The dancing, lavish and colourful sets, orchestral playing under maestro Gergiev, are all top notch.  The choreography by Krill Simonov is new and different to that seen in most productions and this gives a freshness to the production.  Quite a few dances are traditionally performed by solo artists but here are danced by two or three together. Many of the presentations have new, elaborate and effective staging with great effects.  The music is very familiar to me and the overall result in 24 bit surround sound is both entertaining and musically satisfying.  A 12 year old ballet student and her family looked at it with us and everyone voted it ""great"".  Thoroughly recommended.",1247788800,9,813,4.9411764705882355
3521082,2,B001CZVVX2,"The summary above says the the scenario has been updated to a ""more mature"" level. In my opinion, this means that the former scenario that many of us grew up with is virtually gone. The giant Christmas tree, for instance, is no longer. So while the video and audio quality are fine, the content is not. Also, Gergiev's conducting is overdriven and charmless.",1247184000,9,358,4.698412698412699
3521083,1,B001CZVVX2,"I guess the Russians have succomed to the same silliness. Why production designers have to take traditional works (yes they are museum pieces, but museums exhibit many beautiful things) and make them ugly is easy to understand. They want to be ""different."" Tchaikovsky's music does not go well with this production from the Marinsky (formerly Kirov)ballet. Yes, I know that E.T.A. Hoffman's original ""Nutcracker"" is darker than what has traditionally been presented, but Tchaikovsky wrote the music for a lighter, brighter production design. If you think giant houseflies, snow maidens dressed in black, and choruses of dead, pale childred are beautiful, you will like this atrocity. The blue-ray technology is good, but what a waste of technology!",1229990400,21,748,5.401709401709402
3521084,5,B001CZVVX2,"Very different choreography, which made me skeptical at first. But the dancing is first-class and some of the new choreography (Waltz of the Flowers sans Dewdrop) far surpasses Balanchine or Paris Opera in my opinion. Amazing display of technique and aristry by the Kirov, all presented in wonderful Blu-Ray.",1229299200,14,308,5.3061224489795915
3521085,1,B001CZVVX2,Seeing the whole stage was frustrating on a large screen from a damned SD camera. Why???,1228435200,16,88,4.5625
3521086,5,B001CZVVX2,"On the second day of the year 2007, Valery Gergiev conducted another outstanding ballet program at the Mariinsky Theater in Saint Petersburg.  Mihail Chemiakin's 2001 production, with glorious sets and costumes reminiscent of Sendak, brings the action closer in plot and feeling to the original 1816 tale ""Knussknacker und Mausekoenig"" by ETA Hoffmann.  The old chestnut comes to life again, with some new choreography by Kirili Simonov.

Fortunately the video producer, Denis Caiozzi, does not hate ballet like the producer of the recent Swan Lake video from the same stage.  What a relief to see a dancer go through a whole set of interesting maneuvers without ever being interrupted by a useless video cut.  There still are more half-shots than necessary.  The opening pantomimes don't require any complicated footwork, but they are still dancers and still using their feet.  So what benefit do we gain from seeing them cut off at the knee?  See, editor guys, it is like this: high-definition programs are going to be watched on large monitors.  So people don't need closeups the way we used to.  Seeing the whole stage was frustrating on the small screen, but on the large screens seeing a tiny part of the stage is such a waste.  So blu-ray videos need a whole different kind of camerawork.  The video resolution is good enough that the naked eye can pick out details and place them in their proper context.

I know that the great city of Saint Petersburg knows the value of the long shot, because the longest film ever comprising a single, continuous take of footage was recently filmed there, at the Hermitage Museum, on 23 December 2001.  In fact, Valery Gergiev makes a cameo appearance in that film, called RUSSIAN ARK, which lasts 96 minutes on a single camera take.  That kind of thing requires far more intelligence aforethought than all the mindless intercutting of camera angles that pester the life out of ballet films.  My dream is to see Alexander Sokurov, the genius behind RUSSIAN ARK, do a ballet film for the Mariinsky some time.",1227225600,27,2051,4.884393063583815

8290603,5,B001CZVVX2,"It's about time someone shook off the dust that has accumulated for a century on Tchaikovsky's fantasy-filled Nutcracker and restored it to its colorful, magical self. Mihail Chemiakin's production, choreographed by Kirill Simonov and conducted by Valery Gergiev in this 2007 performance, does just that and does it superbly, thanks to the artists of the Mariinsky Ballet and the orchestra of the Mariinsky Theatre.

The ballet establishment, which wants things to stay the way they've ""always"" been, has assailed Chemiakin's Nutcracker with one invective after another. These ""traditionalists"" sound exactly like the entrenched conservatives who lambasted Marius Petipa's original production in 1892.

""A more tedious work was never seen,"" the St. Petersburg Gazette declared. ""Ballet is sliding downhill,"" the New York Times reported. ""Unimaginable bad taste,"" pronounced Vladimir Telyakovsky, an ex-army colonel who would wrangle his way into becoming director of the Imperial Theatres in 1901 and force out the venerated octogenarian Petipa. The Nutcracker went into storage.

For a 1919 revival, choreographer Alexander Gorsky, who had been hired by Telyakovsky, altered Petipa's libretto for Act II into a dream from which Masha (the Russian diminutive of Maria) awakes and returns home. This departed significantly from the storyline that Tchaikovsky had set to music, in which the fantasy land is real and Masha remains there forever. But Gorsky's rewrite became cemented as ""the way we've always done it,"" and The Nutcracker devolved into sentimentality.

If you look at photos of the fanciful costumes worn in the early productions, at the whimsical architecture of cathedrals in St. Petersburg and the elaborate ornamentation of Russian interior and exterior design, if you consider the lavish Imperial Easter eggs created by Peter Faberg during the era of The Nutcracker's genesis, you can see how this staging embodies the spirit of the ballet's original conception.

On the podium, Gergiev keeps up a brisk tempo, and scenes fly by faster than everything can be taken in at first. Before long, though, Gergiev's pace sounds exactly right, and it is the slower tempo of ""the way we've always done it"" that sounds wrong.

More ambiguous than the avuncular figure we've grown accustomed to, Chemiakin's Drosselmeyer is a sometimes sinister, sometimes comic stage manager whose ultimate goals are mysterious. Played to the hilt by Anton Adasinsky, Drosselmeyer resembles Petipa himself, who was described in his later years as ""this small, hunched but always-elegant old man with a neatly trimmed Van Dyke and a gold-rimmed pince-nez."" Everything makes more sense if we see Drosselmeyer here as a representation of Petipa (who had a sort of back-and-forth, tug-of-war working relationship with Tchaikovsky during The Nutcracker's composition), directing traffic onstage and leading the action -- sometimes seemingly against his own will -- toward the ending to which the music is driving it.

Initially, the Mariinsky crowd seems skittish, but by the arrival of the Transformation Scene, the audience, like Masha, is caught up in an extraordinary adventure. The battle is ferocious, filled with the fog of war, and victory leads to a dramatic Snowstorm featuring a children's chorus onstage and Yekaterina Kondaurova as a spectacular Queen of the Snowflakes.

In Chemiakin's production, the Snowstorm is not simply a stop on the way to the Confiturenburg. It also marks a burial of Masha's previous life, an essential step on the path of her rebirth. By the time she and the Nutcracker board the conveyance that will carry them to the Prince's realm and the curtain drops on Act I, the once-skeptical Mariinsky audience erupts into shouts of ""Bravo!"" and resounding applause, well deserved.

Irina Golub, a delightful Masha, dances on pointe for the first time when she and her Nutcracker Prince (Leonid Sarafanov) arrive at the phantasmagoria known as the Confiturenburg. On Blu-ray, it's out of this world. In this uncut Nutcracker, all the dances of Act II are performed. Especially memorable are Kondaurova's sinuous Arabian Dance (or the Dance of the Eastern Snake-charmers) and the corps de ballet's Waltz of the Flowers, as sumptuous as you'd want it to be. Golub executes a nimble Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, and for once, the Apotheosis isn't spoiled by having Masha beat a trite retreat back to the mundane home she left behind.

Besides a booklet with helpful liner notes, the Blu-ray (but not the DVD) includes a 48-minute bonus, ""The Nutcracker Story,"" with historical accounts and interviews that furnish valuable insight into the ballet's origin and Chemiakin's production.

I've watched this Nutcracker from start to finish six times, and on each viewing, I see something I hadn't noticed before. It's an inexhaustible source of enjoyment I will return to over and over.",1412035200,8,4899,5.341115434500648
8290604,2,B001CZVVX2,"Every Christmas Eve, I sit beside my holiday tree with a glass of port and watch a different version of the Nutcracker. This was my 2013 choice.

I honestly don't know what to make of this production. The settings by Mikhail Shemiakin are a grotesque mashup of Maurice Sendak and Tim Burton, populated by sinister long-beaked birds and mice, fat grimacing faces, protruding tongues, dripping substances and ... bees. Lots of bees. The nightmare of a Christmas glutton with indigestion? After twenty minutes, I gave up trying to make any sense of it.

The traditional story and characters are gone. There is no Christmas tree. ""Masha"" (not Clara) spends most of the first act wandering the stage looking rejected and unhappy, accompanied by a young man whose phony paunch is the object of much admiration by party guests. A lame, deformed Drosselmeyer appears for no apparent reason, and sets her up with a Nutcracker. After a half-hearted battle with mice, they fly away in a shoe to the Land of Gluttony, where they must endure a hodgepodge of short dances before being allowed to dance together themselves, and are ultimately united as decorations on a wedding cake.

Irina Golub's Masha doesn't get to dance very much until the second half of the second act, when the Nutcracker is finally unmasked to reveal a baby-faced Nutcracker prince (Leonid Sarafanov). Their duets and solos are strong and exciting. The ensemble Waltz of the Flowers is another highlight. But the showstopper is ""The Dance of the Eastern Snake Charmers"" (traditionally known as the Arabian or Coffee Dance), stunningly performed by a soloist in a glittering green snake costume.

The other themed dances are relatively weak. The ""Dance of the Pulcinellas"" is downright bizarre, consisting of milkmen in long-beaked black masks beating up dolls dressed as milkmen in long-beaked black masks. Confused? Me, too.

The score (unabridged) is conducted at a brisk and occasionally breakneck pace by Valery Gergiev, who appears unshaven, red-eyed and sweaty. During the curtain call, a closeup catches Gergiev snarling something to Sarafanov which clearly upsets the young man, ending the production on a sour note.

Camerawork tends to be busy, often focusing on a single character or group at the expense of a broader perspective. Luckily, the final dances of Masha and the Prince are generously framed.

The high-definition image is generally excellent, sharp and deeply saturated. However, one of the wide-angle cameras appears to have been defective, producing an unstable image that ruins a few scenes, particularly the appearance of the Rat King and Empress.

Sound quality is very good, clear and wide. In a few numbers, the mix of the percussion section wavers in and out.

It's hard to recommend this eccentric production with so many other fine options available. My favorite is still the 2001 Royal Ballet version conducted by Svetlanov on Opus Arte, but this is available only on DVD.

I await the arrival of a definitive Nutcracker on Blu-ray. Maybe next year.",1387929600,,3044,5.094377510040161
8290605,1,B001CZVVX2,"This has to be the ugliest Nutcracker ever staged.  It is simply grotesque.  The backdrops and concept suffer from a compulsive focus on gluttony and physical deformity.  The costumes are elaborate and colorful but lack beauty and grace.  The choreography is angular and disjointed.  The dancing often seems unpracticed and there is little ""magic"" between the lead dancers.  During the curtain calls Valery Gergiev, the conductor, says something threatening or insulting to the lead male dancer, Leonid Sarafanov.  He was alarmed and insulted and that sums up how I felt after watching the video.",1386201600,3,596,5.276595744680851
8290606,1,B001CZVVX2,"these are probably the best dancers on a blu-ray.., but the sets, clothes and artistic choices, everything is horrible and annoying. it is a beautiful mess with the best dancers of the moment. take the version of the royal opera house until something better. especially if you prefer flowers rather than snakes, bees and heads of death. :(",1341014400,7,339,4.862068965517241
8290607,5,B001CZVVX2,"I suspect that this production may offend the purists in the genre, but for me an my family (including my wife and two small kids), this has been a favorite video of the late. Our 1.5 year old son, who would not stay longer than 15 minutes to watch a cartoon or a kid's movie, will sit still for an hour and a half watching this performance. We have seen it dozens of times, and we still enjoy it. Again, as I said, this is not what one would consider a ""classic"" interpretation, and I am not surprised by pros finding flaws here and there, but this is what made the video more enjoyable. I think that the non-ballet part of it (the decorations, the costumes, character twists [e.g. Drosselmeyer's character]) added some spice to the story and made the performance more interesting. Consider it ballet for the masses, or lumpen, if you will. Or look at it as more of a show than a ballet. If you haven't seen it, check out the low-resolution version on YouTube (it was available at the time of writing; look for video 9ScVy8uVzWI). Chances are you may like it.

8290609,5,B001CZVVX2,"I found this production absolutely astonishing.  Astounding, really.  And the prima ballerina -- she could move in ways I did not think possible.  She did some of the strangest things with her feet and ankles that I have ever seen.  I saw the German Nutcracker the next night on Ovation TV but I could only stand it for about three minutes, the boredom and stultifying quality of it.  Shemiakin's Nutcracker is just phenomenal.  I liked especially the mice climbing up on the cake at the end and pulling little pieces off of it with their hands to take into their mouths.  And the living buns and meringues were great.  Well, all of it was.",1323907200,4,640,4.552631578947368
8290610,3,B001CZVVX2,"Valery Gergiev conducts this complete, un-cut version of Tchaikovsky's well-loved ballet, which was filmed in St. Petersburg's Marinsky Theatre where it had its premiere over a century ago.

Unfortunately, the surreal sets and strange, but sumptuous costumes overwhelmed the dancing in this production by avant-garde artist Mikhail Shemiakin, and he certainly had his own ideas about the Nutcracker story.  For instance, his snowflake maidens were dressed in black with little white bobbles on their costumes, and spent much of their time onstage doing the wave, rather than dancing.  They resembled a chorus line out of a 1930s Busby Berkeley musical.

And why was his Drosselmeyer made up to look like a spastic, hunchbacked Varney the Vampire?

For some reason, bumblebees replaced mice in some of the 'fight' scenes, and the poor Nutcracker-prince had to wear his ugly mask almost all the way through the ballet.  He finally removed it after all of the various nationalities did their set-pieces.  When he did, I thought I could figure out why it had remained on so long--Leonid Sarafanov looked about 20 years younger than the prima ballerina, Irina Golub, even though she's actually just a couple of years his senior.

High point: The Persian dance was very cool:  the ballerina, wearing a scaly, green unitard, oiled her way around the stage like a human cobra.  Even the two muppet-snakes bobbing randomly about on either side of her couldn't detract from her performance.

Low point:  the Mirliton dancers in black masks with tall white cylinders on their heads, who spent their time on stage beating up on rag dolls.  What the heck was that supposed to represent?

Greatest costumes:  as the guests were leaving the Stahlbaum house after the Christmas party, they were made up to look like Maurice Sendak characters:  enormous face-concealing hats, short torsos, big muffs.  They were darling.

Worst costumes:  lots of choices here, but I'll settle on the bumblebees with their flaccid, black-and-yellow striped abdomens bobbing about behind them.

My least-favorite aspect of this production was the dancing.  The performers spent way too much time sprinting across the stage or writhing on the floor.  Sometimes, as in the Chinese set-piece, the dancing was banal.  Sometimes it was frenzied--Irina Golub kept wind-milling her arm in a circle as though she were trying to lasso a cow.  Leonid Sarafanov performed his lifts as though he were heaving a sack of cement into a truck.  I expect beautiful dancing in a ballet, especially one by Tchaikovsky, and that was an infrequent occurrence in this production.
