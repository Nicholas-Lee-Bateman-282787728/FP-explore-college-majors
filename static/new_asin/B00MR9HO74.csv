6600281,5,B00MR9HO74,"Who doesn't love the King Family? I loved the video. It brought me back to a time when all was simple and good in the world.
Maybe I should buy another one before I wear this one out - LOL.  Great gift for anyone from the  Baby Boomer or GI Generation.",1460678400,2,252,3.9215686274509802
6600282,4,B00MR9HO74,"Great muisc from the past.  I know that King Family was popular in the States. In Brazil no one know them. But I received an album,
just 'Christmas with King Family"" as a gift, and I liked them. So...years later I ordered for the CD...and this DVD...I recommend to those
who like Christmas music, family-oriented shows, and wants to ""revive"" some great moments.",1455235200,2,361,4.73015873015873

6600285,5,B00MR9HO74,"After years of watching my bad bootleg copy of the King Family Christmas special, I am thrilled to add this professionally produced dvd to my collection. It's ALL wonderful to watch but the highlight is the reunion of Alyce King with her son Ric de Azevedo. No matter how many times I watch, it always brings a tear to my eye. Vocal family BRILLIANCE!",1448064000,2,351,4.5
6600286,5,B00MR9HO74,"I am probably biased because I was part of the production crew, but the transfer to DVD is great and I look forward to seeing more of the KingFam specials on DVD in the foreseeable future.

With all of the King Sisters now gone, only the 4 King Cousins continue to carry the King Family banner.  I am very grateful to Tina, Cathy, Carolyn and Candy for doing so.  The 4 KC have their own DVD out and I recommend it for both their retro and original music.",1444521600,8,455,4.1477272727272725

6600288,5,B00MR9HO74,"No less entertaining now than when it was then. Some older shows don't age well because they were more a product of their era. However, this holds up well because the specials were about love and family and that will always be timeless.",1423699200,2,236,4.511627906976744

6600292,2,B00MR9HO74,"King sisters were a great talent. Unfortunately their television programs are not as enjoyable as I thought they would be. The programs were not done well enough to last the test of time, in my opinion. The programs did not highlight the King sisters, but were built around the entire family and their talent was not what the King sisters' was.",1418688000,,344,4.655737704918033

8674201,5,B00MR9HO74,"Again, Loved everything about all their DVD's and sharing their love and families with the world!
Their DVD's bring back a flood of wonderful, warm and loving memories of a day when things were simpler and more caring.
Thanks to the family for sharing, we all need a little reminder of what it once was and could be again.  I wish I was part of their family.
Their whole Family is so extremely talented.",1527206400,,403,4.445945945945946

8674203,5,B00MR9HO74,"Although I don't remember watching the King family as a child I certainly know enough about pop-culture to know who they are. Like many males I always thought Tina Cole from my three sons was quite attractive. This show brings back memories of my youth and I love to see what things look like from 1967. Its also nice to have the commentary from the stars of the show who are still alive. The music is great and It will put you in the holiday spirit. Too bad they don't make specials like this anymore or more important, that the world isn't like this anymore. I certainly wish it was as it was a simpler, more gentle time. Its really part of my Christmas tradition to watch it. If you're into retro Classix and appreciate talent and simple clean entertainment then I highly recommend it.",1521244800,,788,4.441379310344828
