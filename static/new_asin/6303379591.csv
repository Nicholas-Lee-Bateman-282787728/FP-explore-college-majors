7844913,4,6303379591,"On September 25, 1981, Sandra Day O'Connor became the first  female Supreme Court Justice of the United States. This twenty-five minute video encompasses an overview of Justice O'Connor's career and life as a lawyer, politician, and judge.
  Raised on a ranch bordering Arizona and New Mexico, Sandra Day was an exceptional child who could read at the age of four and learned how to ride a horse before she could walk. Her mother told her she could do anything and Sandra believed every word of it and excelled.
  At Stanford Law School, she was the third in her class but upon graduation didn't receive any offers from any law firms. Very few women were lawyers and the opportunities if any were few. Day didn't allow this to hold her back. She married, had children and started her own firm. As time went on she involved herself into politics and through hard work was nominated by President Reagan to sit on the highest court.
  Although the video is brief, it focuses on the high points of her career. It is an excellent resource for the study of women in law and an inspiration for all young people. O'Connor didn't allow the stereotypes of women in her time to hold her back. A brilliant mind, fortitude, the right timing and a don't give up attitude enabled her to reach the high court. By all means watch this educational and inspiring video.",1052784000,2,1350,4.623430962343096
