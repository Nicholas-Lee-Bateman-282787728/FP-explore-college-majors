659469,5,6303473261,"Orson Welles' only color film is THE ULTIMATE PROOF OF 'MISE EN SCENE' HAPPENING AT THE EDITING STAGE. Most of this film was shot by Francois  Reichenbach before Welles got involved with it. Reichenbach didn't know  what to do with his footage--how to best put it all together--so he asked  Welles, whom he greatly admired, to see what he could do. Welles shot some  scenes featuring himself to go around the documentary footage, came up with  a narrative concept and EDITED everthing.  The result? WELLES' PERSONALITY  TOOK OVER. This is unmistakably a film that only Orson Welles could make.  Welles uses his ingenious narration and every trick known to film editing  to weave a philosophical meditation on the nature of truth and lies that  has DEEP universal significance, but also particularly applies to the  nature of all 'ART-ifice.' It's a very intellectual as well as supremely  entertaining film which requires at least 5 viewings to even begin to be  appreciated.",967420800,27,975,5.01875
659470,5,6303473261,"Wow, what a treat for Welles fans. This is a fascinating piece of work. So interesting and the editing is excellent. Wonderful appearances by Orson to tantalise the viewer (love the trick he plays on us at the end). It's a  must see.  A unique type of documentary film, solely  concentrating on two outrageous fakers. From the feel & look of the  movie, you can tell that Welles is having the time of his life, and that's  good enough for me.",953942400,10,442,4.407407407407407
659471,5,6303473261,"With all the fury and venom expended on the question of what is art, this excellent film of Welles should be required viewing.  Welles reminds us that, ultimately, the only art critic you need to worry about is yourself.  Listen very carefully in this film to Welles recitation of Rudyard  Kipling's poem; the crux of this film is contained in those lines. We are,  each of us, Masters and Artists. What does it matter what anyone else  thinks? Secondly, this film is also a little frightening. Almost 30 years  after its making the tyranny of ""experts"" in everything from  litigation to art continues to confound us. We continue to sacrifice common  sense and our own autonomy to the ""experts"" . Finally, this film  is just plain fun. Fake? EVERYTHING IS FAKE... everything is art... in  spite of ""experts"".",946771200,14,808,4.7898550724637685
659472,5,6303473261,"""F For Fake"" is one of the great treatises ever made on the nature of art, and the fine line between truth and lies in the face of a work of art. Can a hoax still be considered art, even if it is a hoax? Who  is truly responsible for a work? The artist? What if it is a collaboration?  ""F For Fake"" asks many other questions including about Welles's  own artistic achievements, like ""Citizen Kane."" Was he the true  author of that film?
""F For Fake"" is beautifully made - a  lovingly rhythmic collage of iamges, documentary footage, and Welles' own  brand of trickery and devilish wit. Rightfully regarded by Truffaut as one  of the best films of the 70's and it is. It's also Welles's last genuine  masterpiece.",922147200,5,712,4.423076923076923
659473,5,6303473261,"This movie is a clear example of Welles great techinque and wit. As in Citizen Kene This movie has a tornado like begining. Some times it is hard to follow the story but at the end, we will be left with a bitersweet  sensation and with a new idea of what is art and life. A great movie.",919036800,2,286,3.9310344827586206
659614,2,6303473261,This movie is so incoherent that it's BORING. I guess the intent was to do something artistic and splice together a bunch of segments like a collage. It quickly gets VERY tiresome. I would prefer a coherent documentary about the artist accused of fakery. He is phenomenally talented and deserves recognition for what he achieves in the styles of many great artists.,1406937600,,365,4.903225806451613
659615,3,6303473261,"This was a very fragmented tale of an art faker with accompanying support ""cast"". Orson Welles was responsible for it and it was very much in his style, but some of the subtle nuances were confusing at first and then became clear. What sets my scale for only rating it as ""okay"" was that once I figured it all out, I was not willing to watch it again. Lots of great scenery, some genuine laughs at how many supposed fakes were in museums and I had read that elsewhere........but overall it did not capture me as I thought it would when I purchased it..........bzzzpt, raspberries to Orson for this one, a bit too too dramatic.",1402617600,,626,4.452173913043478

659617,2,6303473261,"detracts from an interesting documentary about a successful European art forger. Unfortunately the story is drowned in a tsunami of Bain de Soleil, sunglasses and bikinis- the story seems more about yachts in Ibiza than the skill of the forger.  Orson Welles is insufferably snooty as he films the idle rich who knew and/or were fooled by the forger in Ibiza.",1388361600,,359,4.885245901639344
659618,5,6303473261,"This is a marvelous movie. Thought provoking, well acted and written, beautifully done.  Don't miss this great Orson Wells film.",1359072000,,128,5.4
659619,4,6303473261,"His last major work as a filmmaker, Orson Welles' ""F for Fake"" (1973) survives as a rough-edged yet provocative essay on the art of fraud. In this instance, we have three noted subjects: art forger extraordinaire Elmyr de Hory, Clifford Irving (the novelist who conned the world as Howard Hughes' ""authorized biographer"") and Welles himself. Editing plays a vital role as the Great Orson maintains his semi-documentary juggling act for 90 minutes. Fittingly enough, ""F for Fake"" reveals more about the creator of ""Citizen Kane"" than the minor curiosities he examines. Welles ends his cinematic odyssey with an affectionate wink.",1203292800,22,628,5.29
659620,2,6303473261,"Orson Welles was a master of film. But not this film. While I appreciate the message he is trying to convey, his ""cleverness"" is off the deep end.  This film is like a big ego-trip for Welles.  He's so proud of how clever he is.  But the film is a mess, like paranoid, disjointed ramblings.  In his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style. Clever is most clever when it is not obvious.  In this film he beats you over the head with the ""subtext"" and thinks he's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled-up the story line.  I'm sorry I wasted my time to watch it.  I would have turned it off, but given my high respect for Welles, I continued, expecting a revelation or twist.  Alas, no, it was just a stupid movie.",1132704000,10,752,4.20979020979021
659621,5,6303473261,"There is no Orson Welles movie, no matter how influential and well regarded, that I love more than this master piece. This is Orson Welles at his best: just chating along in an entertaining, funny, witty, profound way, teaching you so much about himself, about humanity and about Life, as if it was just a walk in the park - he makes it look so easy to be a genius.
If I had to choose the proverbial film I would take with me to a deserted island, this would be the one. This is the guy I want to talk to forever if I'm ever allowed in whatever Paradise he's in now.
This is all anyone needs to love the movies and Orson Welles. It is the one that will convert you into thinking you can't really have one without the other.",1070323200,19,723,4.098591549295775
659622,3,6303473261,"Long after Orson Welles lost the clout to produce Hollywood feature films, he managed to cobble together this idiosyncratic essay film from documentary footage shot by French filmmaker Francois Reichenbach.  Initially, the subjects are master art forger Elmyr de Hory and his would-be biographer Clifford Irving, also author of the infamous Howard Hughes biography.  Welles eventually transforms the film into an analysis of the question of authorship: who is truly the ""author"" of a work of art?
Welles packs the film with guest stars, anecdotes, and witticisms... even a magic trick! It's not perfect: the film changes gears perhaps one too many times, and Welles can't resist including gratuitous shots of his mistress, Oja Kodar.  But Welles aficionados will delight in the director's foray into deconstructionist cinema.  ""F for Fake"" lies somewhere between the realms of fact and fiction.  Welles the magician conjures up an altogether new form of movie, one that can't be easily classified.",1066867200,4,997,5.365384615384615
659623,5,6303473261,"Master filmmaker and artist, Orson Welles, takes you on an intriguing trip  into the world of the Fake and the Real. Do you really know the difference  between what people tell you and what you know to be real? Perhaps enough  people have told you the ""truth"" where it seems there is no doubt  as to what is really real, when all along you were given an pseudo-truth  when in fact the truth turned out to be comepletely fake and no one knew  about it. This idea, essentially is what this film is about. Filmed in a  documentary style, mainly focusing on the life of Elmyr de Hory, one of his  many ""fake"" names. Elmyr is a famous artist, except no one knows  who he is because he has ""faked"" other famous artist  masterpieces. In which case the ""experts"" cannot tell one from  the other. So much, in fact, that the ""experts"" have argued  emphatically that Elmyr's version is the ""real"" one. The well  known biographer Clifford Irving wrote about Elmyr's life and his  ""fake"" masterpieces. Irving known especially for the biography of  the late Howard Hughes. Except one ""fact remained in suspicion of  Irving's book is how this man comes along and is granted an interview with  Mr. Hughes who has been in hiding for the past 20 years. So the argument  remained that Irving's biography of Hughes was indeed ""faked.""  Mr. Orson Welles, who appears from time to time is credited as the director  did indeed direct some of the film, while he ""faked"" it other  times. Welles known for his ""fake"" news bulletin of the War of  the Worlds also lets the view see one hour of totally ""true""  documentary of Elmyr, Hughes and Irving. This is nice of Mr. Welles, and if  anyone knows about time, they will bear in mind the film runs longer than  one hour.
Its not a casual film of entertainment like Welles' other  works, some deemed the best in film history by some ""experts.""  No, this film takes some turns of the usual Hollywood style narrative and  makes an almost chaotic feast of editing where time seems to have slowed  down. The only draw back to the film is the one just mentioned, that it  seems entirely too long when in fact its quite shorter than one expects.  Another leg Mr. Welles pulls on the viewers to have them presume as much as  they want and get something entirely different.
Not for everyone's  taste, but certainly for either the Orson Welles fanatic, and for the  person who likes to have thier reality challenged. Cutting edge by means of  style and presentation of the film, Mr. Welles has certainly done it again.  Unfortunately this has dropped into the back shelf of ""important""  films.",969235200,28,2606,4.574837310195227

7848113,5,6303473261,"This review is an excerpt from my book ""Killer B's: The 237 Best Movies On Video You've (Probably) Never Seen,"" which is available as an ebook on Amazon. If you enjoy this review, there are 236 more like it in the book (plus a whole lot more). Check it out!

F FOR FAKE: ""I'm a charlatan,"" Orson admits in his introduction. ""And this is a film about trickery. About fraud. About...lies."" It's all that, and much more. There are four principal players in this story ""rotten with coincidence."" The first is Elmyr de Hory, the world's greatest art forger, who paints in the style of every modern master (we watch him paint a passable Matisse on camera, for example), and claims to have works hanging in every major gallery in the world.

The second ""character"" is author Clifford Irving, who wrote a book about Elmyr entitled ""Fake""--and who would later become famous for attempting his own hoax, obtaining an enormous advance for a book based on an alleged interview with billionaire recluse Howard Hughes. The third character is Welles himself, a man who began his career with a spectacular hoax (the ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast) and who then headed for Hollywood with the original intention to film a thinly-veiled biography of an eccentric millionaire--not William Randolph Hearst, but Howard Hughes.

If it sounds as though the film comes full circle, be aware that the above synopsis is only the first of numerous wheels-within-wheels revolving within the pinwheel of Welles' penultimate film. This mind-boggling movie is a trip through the looking glass of truth and lies, which chase each other's tails to the point that they become indistinguishable. (Consider the story of the man who paid for a forgery with a bouncing check, or Welles' attempt to distinguish between real fakes and fake fakes, and you might see how these strange loops of deception spiral deeper, ever deeper.)

It's a very personal document as well: a meditation on Art, and on the art of larceny. As Pablo Picasso (who becomes the fourth major character in the film) said, ""Art is a lie--a lie that makes us realize the truth."" Welles would never confess to ""committing masterpieces,"" but at least he left us this final magic trick: a Chinese puzzle box for the intellect.",1422489600,,2258,4.872395833333333
