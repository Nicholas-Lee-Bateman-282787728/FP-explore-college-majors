8255953,5,B0014JTPWU,"Pride's Shockwave was an anual year-end event which usually featured a stacked-card with most of their big name fighters. This was the final Shockwave event for Pride. This DVD was released under Zuffa's ownership, so the formant is a bit different from earlier Pride releases. Aside from the main content, there are a few special features. These include a Walk-in Montage(4 min) with all of the night's fights.

A Fighter Picture Montage(2 min) as well as The Opening Chorus(6 min) with Nobuhiko Takada playing the grand piano and a Japanese lady singing in English. In addition, two bouts listed under the ""extras"" section include Akihiro Gono vs. Yuki Kondo and Kiyoshi Tamura vs. Ikuhisa Minowa. Some big-name fighters you still hear about on this card include Fedor, Shinya Aoki, Shogun, Big Nog, Barnett, and Gomi. Great event and spectacle as Pride was known for..don't miss it!",1271116800,,885,5.061643835616438
8255954,5,B0014JTPWU,"While the PRIDE FC Shockwave 2006 event is great, there are a few things that just irked me the wrong way with the DVD.  None of it has to deal with the event itself, but a few minor mistakes that should have been caught in production before release.

1. There are 10 fights in the show, and instead of putting them all together, they moved two of them to the Bonus Features.  It's not that big of a deal, but I dislike the idea of going to a different part of the DVD to watch 2 additional fights.  These two fights are Ikuhisa Minowa Vs. Kiyoshi Tamura and Akihiro Gono Vs. Yuki Kondo.

2. On the DVD Insert, where they give the full listing of every match included on the DVD, they list Aleksander Emelianenko Vs. Pawel Nastula, which is from Shockwave 2005, not 2006.  Akihiro Gono Vs. Yuki Kondo isn't on the list.  This is a big oversight, that should have been caught immediately.

3. In the Bonus Features, they miss-spell Gono's name with ""Guono.""  This is also done on the back cover with the same miss-spelling.  When you click on the fight and it starts by showing the images of the fighters with their names, they once again miss-spell Gono's name, this time spelling it ""Gouno.""  Gono's name is spelled correctly in the fight footage during the introduction.  I still can't believe that they found 2 ways to incorrectly spell his name.

Aside from these few mistakes, I still highly recommend picking up Shockwave 2006.  The Chorus Opening is definitely worth a look in the bonus features, as well as the highlights of the fighters walking down to the ring, both of which aren't normally show on MMA dvds.  I look forward to the future PRIDE FC releases, hopefully with fewer mistakes this time around.",1209686400,5,1716,4.543973941368078
