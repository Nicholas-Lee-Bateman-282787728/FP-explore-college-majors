In addition to interviews, the documentaries feature photographs, diagrams, filmed research scenes, and current genetic information that supports past research results.  These documentaries are an excellent way to learn about important biological concepts in a brief amount of time.

Disc 1:

""Sorting Out -- Cellular Rearrangements And The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis Of Malcolm Steinberg.""  Using a compression force that indicates a cell's resistance to deformation, Malcolm Steinberg (1930 -- February 7, 2012) determined various cells' surface tensions are directly related to their adhesive strength with other cells of their exact kind and to their internal segregation ability relative to other cells.  Steinberg established an internal segregation hierarchy of cells: germinative epidermis> precartilage> pigmented retina> myocardium> neural tube> liver.  While the internal segregation information is logically presented, there is one apparent contradiction: the mesoderm segregating internally to the endoderm, which had previously occupied the internal position before recombination.  Steinberg's research also appears in ""Cell Adhesive Interactions And Tissue Self-Organization"" on pages 137-163 of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Origination-of-Organismal-Form-Beyond-the-Gene-in-Developmental-and-Evolutionary-Biology-Vienna-Series-in-Theoretical-Biology/dp/0262134195/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Origination of Organismal Form: Beyond the Gene in Developmental and Evolutionary Biology (Vienna Series in Theoretical Biology)</a>.

""Extracellular Matrix -- The Stuff From Cells And The Discoveries Of Elizabeth Hay.""  Using radioactive proline, Elizabeth Hay demonstrated that the epithelium produces collagen.  Then, in a series of in vitro experiments, Hay demonstrated that the extracellular environment determines whether the epithelium will produce collagen or not.

""Homeosis In The Fly -- A Story Of Transdetermination From Walter Gehring.""  Using the eyeless gene of the fruit fly and the PAX6 gene of the mouse in separate experiments, Walter Gehring caused ectopic eyes to form on the wings and antennae of the fruit fly, indicating the potential presence of a master control gene for vision.

""Life Cycles -- Lessons From The Cellular Slime Mold As Discovered By John Tyler Bonner.""  John Tyler Bonner studied the life cycle and various characteristics of the cellular slime mold (Dictyostelium discoideum).

Disc 2:

""Primary Induction -- The Double-Gradient Hypothesis.""  Lauri Saxen studied the development of head and trunk-tail regions in vertebrates.

""Chimeric Grafts -- Following The Pathways Of Migrating Cells.""  Transplanting neural tube segments with associated neural crest cells from black quails to white chicks, Nicole Le Douarin created black-and-white chicks, demonstrating that the skin pigment of vertebrates is determined by neural crest cells.

""From Somites To Thalidomide.""  James W. Lash (1929-2000) demonstrated that mesonephric kidney tissue stimulates the somites in the developing embryo to form cartilage and that thalidomide inhibits limb development.

""Pattern Formation In The Vertebrate Limb.""  In limb bud experiments, John W. Saunders, Jr. demonstrated the importance of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) for full limb development, that a second AER embedded into a limb bud causes a second wing tip to form, and that the orientation of the ectodermal jacket (epithelium) determines the dorsal-ventral axis.  Saunders' documentary concludes with his speaking appearance at a Society For Developmental Biology meeting held in his honor:  ""And let us not forget as we look to the future of our discipline that there are the giants of the past, who have provided us with a firm foundation upon which to stand as we explore the yet-unknown secrets of the embryo with the tools of the future.""  (Limb bud research is also featured in ""Development Of Vertebrate Limbs: Insights Into Pattern, Evolution And Dysmorphogenesis"" by Martin J. Cohn and Philippa E. Bright on pages 1-28 of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Development-Growth-and-Evolution-Volume-20-Implications-for-the-Study-of-the-Hominid-Skeleton-Linnean-Society-Symposium/dp/0125249659/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Development, Growth and Evolution, Volume 20: Implications for the Study of the Hominid Skeleton (Linnean Society Symposium)</a>).

I also appreciated learning about the researchers' personal challenges such as Malcolm Steinberg encountering his father's disapproval of his decision to become a research scientist and Jerome Gross's disbelief of Elizabeth Hay's experiment that demonstrated that the epithelium produced collagen as well as Lauri Saxen's advisement that research should be fun.",1364515200,,5138,6.887345679012346
