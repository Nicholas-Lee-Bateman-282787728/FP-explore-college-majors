8493361,2,B0065D73CY,"First off, these are not really grindhouse films. These are 20, mostly foreign films, poorly dubbed, poorly transferred from VHS. The reason why these individual films are rare and out of print is because no one wants to see them again.

The films are in 3 separate DVD cases with 5 discs. The discs are two sided with 2 films on each side. The two films are placed together as a theme, i.e. 2 prison movies, 2 westerns etc. No real Grindhouse.

8493362,2,B0065D73CY,"I suppose if you absolutely HAVE to have some of these obscure grimy grindhouse films on these sets in your collection, it's not a bad deal for the price. Just be aware of a couple of things...these are all transferred from VHS tapes. Bad quality VHS tapes. Bad quality VHS tapes with frequent glitches. A few of them have forced subtitles...in Dutch. Also, although I bought Volume 1 brand new and it claims that it's a ""20 Film Feature Collection"", my copy only came with 8 discs that totaled 16 films, not 20, so make sure you examine your copy right away if you buy this to get what you pay for.  Then again, considering the poor quality of these releases, maybe they were doing me a favor.",1361059200,4,694,4.421875
