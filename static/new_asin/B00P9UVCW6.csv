8687128,4,B00P9UVCW6,"Pretty interesting. I remember there used to be a Ripley's show on TV in the 1990s. Good to hear his life story. There is a Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum in Newport, Oregon. Google shows that there are a total of six current Ripley's museums spread across the United States. You can ask your local library to order a copy of this film if you would like to see it.",1488931200,,367,4.183098591549296
8687129,5,B00P9UVCW6,This is an interesting video. It covers the beginning of the Ripley Believe it or Not cartoon. From there it covers the life of Ripley. It explains how he got his start cartooning and took the opportunity he was given to travel and change that into a career of the wierd and unusual. One of the things I liked was the old footage from his tv shows that was included in this show. This wasn't very long and it was interesting watch.,1464393600,,431,4.2682926829268295
8687130,4,B00P9UVCW6,"Chronicles the life of cartoonist Robert Ripley from his youth in California to his move to NYC where when he was on a deadline trotted out some unusual factoids for a column. He occasionally shared some more and they were loved. He gained a source hunter and began running installments regularly.

He travels the world seeking oddities. Eventually he gets a book published and appears on screen and eventually television as well as having a museum. Insightful, features some of the odd folks in clips and they are a little difficult to look at.",1461369600,,545,4.797872340425532
8687131,5,B00P9UVCW6,I've always loved Ripley's Believe It or Not museums and this dvd was able to let Me know about the man Himself.  Very interesting biography.,1426204800,3,141,4.64
8687132,5,B00P9UVCW6,"If you are over the age of 60, you probably remember seeing the Ripleys Believe it or Not feature in the newspaper or on TV in the 1950s. Or, if youve been to Times Square or Atlantic City you may have seen the RBON Museum. This new episode in the American Experience series on PBS tells the story of how Robert (Bob) Ripley  a sports cartoonist in the 1920s  got involved in finding what he called Curi0oddities around the world. I found it fascinating  though I have to say I did cringe at some of the bizarre film footage of a man who could smoke or inflate a balloon with his eye (just try to picture that) or trurn his head 360 degrees. So its not for the squeamish.

The 53-minute documentary has interviews with Ripleys biographer, a cartoon historian, the archivist for Ripley Enterprises and a former colleague of Ripley. Theres some rare footage from both the Vitaphone (early talkie) shorts from circa 1930 and of the 1949 NBC TV show.  It is narrated by actor Oliver Platt.

If you remember the cartoon  or are interest in side-shows or what are called freaks  then youll find this short program interesting. The DVD has no bonus features.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
