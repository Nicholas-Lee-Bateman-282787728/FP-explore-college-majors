This show is extremely slow, and the animation looks like a bunch of paper cut outs being moved along a digital background.  While things start to get a little more exciting towards the end of the tape, I still felt like falling asleep.  ADV must have felt the same way because they canceled the rest of the VHS volumes and now are just doing a DVD release for the whole series in one collection.  If you have to see this series RENT it first.  Otherwise watch the original or BGC, ...",1009756800,,616,4.213675213675214
7929255,5,B000050IKY,"The history behind the events on this three-episode tape is this: a great earthquake demolished the city of Tokyo.  Genome Company helped to rebuild the city using cyborg's called Boomers as their unpaid and convent labor.  The city was then renamed Genome City.  Problems have arisen in the city due to rogue Boomers who have been dubbed Voomers (Voodoo Organic Metal Extension Resources) who have runaway, caused accidents, and have been the cause of violent crimes.  A special police branch called the A.D. police was created to deal with this new, high tech threat.
Act 1 Partner  In the first episode a young, loner, and unconventional A.D. police officer named Kenji Sasaki whose previous two partners have all died while working with him decides to involve himself in a hostage situation that has taken place outside of his jurisdiction.  The situation in question involves a man with a stick of dynamite who has taken some people in a building hostage.  He threatens to light the dynamite if his ex-wife isn't brought to him.  After handling this situation Kenji and his partner Paul Sanders just happen to be cruising near an area where a runaway Voomer is at and so they decide to split up and take the Voomer out from opposite sides.  Unfortunately, Paul is seriously injured in the process taking Kenji's number of lost partner's up to three. Eventually Kenji is partnered with a good-looking German man named Hans Kleif and they just happen to not get along which makes things interesting.  Also Hans begins his pursuit of the affections of a cute nurse.
Act 2 Runaway In this episode a runaway Voomer just happens to take-over an ambulance that Paul happens to be in.  Naturally, Kenji goes out to try and save him.  His new partner Hans and his love interest also end up getting involved in the situation.
Act 3 Bargaining In this episode a seemingly important and intelligent villain named Liam Fletcher is introduced and Hans and Kenji finally learn the meaning of the word teamwork.
I'll admit that I've never ever watched Bubble Gum crisis or any other series related to it before but I thoroughly enjoyed this tape and I'm looking forward to the next volume to learn more about who's really behind the recent Voomer activities and where Liam Fletcher fits into all of this.",986947200,2,2293,4.821428571428571
7929256,5,B000050IKY,"Excluding the fact that the theme music [stunk], this one movie truely is a spin off the established BGC Storylines.
While the Armored Foursome don't appear (and established AD Police Officers Leon McNichol and Dailey Wong don't make an appearence here as well; plus the fact that the storyline doesn't have a setting of MegaTokyo, rather Genom City; and, the time seems to be around 2032, where the original series began(not the 2040 version), the story revolves around Officer Kenji Sasaki, a Officer that seems to have the knack of having his fellow partners either killed or maimed. Plus, he has a serious Loner problem and always breaks the rules; and, he cannot deny his regular police roots.
While slapped with Administrative leave, he gets a German Partner named Hans Kleif. Let's just say how they met is best left for viewing via the tape. (Also, Hans has a serious secret...one that can get him killed at anytime.)
With a chance to redeem himself after his previous partner is seriously injured in a VOOMER Attack (Yes, it's VOOMER, not BOOMER in this series), he must not only work with Hans, he also must face personal demons and figure out the serious rise in VOOMER related incidents (all the while trying to work with his teammates).
While the Animation seems to be outdated and old, truely one to watch, and in the similar vein of the BGC saga.
