5373542,5,B009Z59778,"Having waited seemingly forever for Red Dwarf to REALLY return (not counting the lackluster&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Dwarf-Back-to-Earth/dp/B0026P3HPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Dwarf: Back to Earth</a>), I am delighted to report that the wait was worth it!  Red Dwarf X recaptures the feel of the original Series 1 thru 6, especially with the use of a live audience.  And the show is FUNNY again, which didn't happen very often in series 7, 8 and ""Back to Earth.""

[Minor Spoilers Ahead]

Sidestepping (or rather, ignoring completely) any continuity issues, Series X gives the fans back what made the show work best during its heyday: Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten aboard the mining ship Red Dwarf, encountering all manner of cosmic and comic situations.  The best of these 6 shiny new episodes are character-driven, such as the excellent ""Fathers and Suns.""  And where else but on Red Dwarf would you find characters traveling back in time, picking up Jesus, then having to give him an emergency operation for kidney stones (""Lemons"")?

The only thing really missing is Holly, the ship's original computer.  But you just may find yourself laughing too hard to notice.  And credit must really be given to the four principal actors for stepping back into their roles with such apparent ease.  And everyone has aged extremely well, especially when you consider they've been playing these roles for about 25 years.  The show itself looks very polished, but not in a distracting way like Series 7 did.

As with previous series releases, this one has bonus disc with a lengthy documentary, plus that good ol' fan-favorite, the Smeg Ups. All in all, a very solid continuation of a cult show that, happily, refuses to die.  Highly recommended.",1357603200,12,1796,5.326241134751773
5373543,5,B009Z59778,"These guy's never get old. The same great humor and story as the early days of Red Dwarf!!! Much better than VII and VIII, if you didn't care for those too much.",1357516800,5,161,4.0625
5373544,5,B009Z59778,"Just spent the weekend watching this series( had to get the reg 2 version, couldn't wait). May I say it was like old times watching the old series 1-6. The writing was tight and the gang seemed to be more in sync . Filming in front of a live audience brought back to old sitcom feeling.

Series 7&8 and the Back to Earth series always had a different feeling, almost maudlin or dramedy tone to it. I do miss the fact that Holly wasn't in this series. I also missed the fact that there was no commentary to go along with it. I assume there wasn't enough time to do the documentary and commentary in time for the quick release.

My favorite of the bunch would be ""Lemons"". It was ultimate Red Dwarf. Calling into question the belief system in a comical way . Also in the last of the series ""The Beginning"" there is a tease of what happened after season 8, but yet again we are left twisting in the wind.

Overall, it was great laughing out loud again at a series that I have seen over the last 2 plus decades! ""The slime's coming home!""",1357171200,,1034,4.212121212121212

The episodes are still great. My favorite this season is, Trojan, fathers and suns, and lemons. Without giving the plot away for Lemons, I will just say the Catholic Church may not love the episode.

5373574,5,B009Z59778,"I do love it. I shouldn't. The idea should long ago have mined out every vein of humour to be had from this situation. But it hasn't, and here are six new episodes with the actors looking as if they finished filming series VIII just a week ago.

The decision to use real sets as opposed to greenscreen CGI was perfect and delivers in spades. The world looks better in every way than in the ""Back To Earth"" specials.

And the lads are in rare form. I was starting to detect an undercurrent of tedium in series VIII, almost the same feel as The Beatles put out in the film Let It Be: Everyone is fed up with the idea and wants to move on. Earlier, there seemed to be tension between the Chris Barrie and Craig Charles that bled through to their performances in some places. This is not detectable here.

The team have captured the spirit of the original shows for the days when everyone was fresh to their roles and the ideas were coming thicker and faster than the chicken soup from vending machine 12.

And for the purists: The model has been shortened again, back to the dumpy original profile.

There's another disc of extras like deleted scenes and smeg-ups and making-of specials and I dunno what all else. The look inside the brilliantly clever roll-away modular sets is a personal favorite.

Bravo!",1472774400,,1304,4.481012658227848

I was a fanatic for RD back in the early 90's and as I watched this it felt like no time had passed.  Although we're all older now, the cast picked up the characters and story as if no time had passed!  It was great.  Their chemistry is still there and this revival felt natural.

  I really enjoyed the fact that they filmed this in front of a live audience and if you watch the extra's you will see that the laughter was definately not canned or faked-looked like several of the audience members were going to fall out of their seats with laughter at times.
  This series was filmed exactly as the original many,many,years ago and the HD makes the sound and video really sharp.
  I have to admit i was a little bit hesitant to buy this Bluray because i bought the ""Back to Earth"" film and it was a bit of a disappointment.

Red Dwarf is a wonderful comedy which is completely family friendly.  They do not have cursing in the show and topics like sex are avoided. While they do occasional have alcohol featured on the show that's about as raunchy as it gets. This series is another great from Red Dwarf crew.  Even after all the years since the last series, they still captured what is great about Red Dwarf.  For those of you that do not know, this series started in 1988.  It took off and became the BBC top rated series by nearly double the viewership.  Where they were receiving 8-9 million people per episode and the show right after it would drop down to 4 million. The series features Dave Lister the last remaining human being  and a hologram of his dead bunk mate Arnold Rimmer.  A life from that evolved from Dave pet cat and is now simply known as the Cat and an Android they found on a crashed derelict vessel.

The series is missing Holly the ship computer.  This by no means says its lacking in Comedy.  You do not need to have watched the previous series to enjoy this one, however it would help with understanding established relationships and charter norms.",1450915200,,1287,4.457264957264957

My favorite of these episodes turns out to have been a hard one for them to make (you find out a lot more about the difficulties of production by watching the extras), but much like the Thanksgiving episodes of ""Friends"" where there are fewer sets and are more Intimate, this particular episode I thought really shined, called ""Dear Dave"" (the fifth episode).

The lowlights are very few but if I must nitpick I would say that the jokes were a little predictable as you knew a cat gag was coming or a Rimmer gag was coming and some of the jokes were flat but the true gem of this series, if not the entire run of the series is the chemistry of the cast which hasn't waned a bit considering the show has been around for  27 years. The visual effects are really good and  considering the budget they had are miraculous the blend of model work and CGI was excellent. This was a great series and I recommend it to any true dwarfer or even a new viewer as it was very accessible and I look forward to watching series 11 and 12 when they come out.",1441152000,2,963,4.1063829787234045

Well, it had to happen sooner or later.

It's been said that even bad Red Dwarf is better than no Red Dwarf at all, but this season proves that maxim untrue, and for my personal canon, this season didn't happen.

If you've been a fan of Red Dwarf since Series I (which for American viewers I'll now refer to as ""season""), you've come to love these characters and the whacky situations they find themselves in.  You've also seen them grow.  One of the great things about Naylor/Grant's writing (and later Naylor/Alexander) is that despite the fact that this is a comedy series, they take their characters (like the sci-fi aspects) seriously and actually developed them over the course of seven seasons.

Now, the show developed and grew along with them, so that we saw improvements in the special effects and the overall style and look of the show.  These writers weren't content to just do the same thing over and over again.  Real writers aren't.  They need to experiment and challenge themselves, and they did, successfully for at least seven seasons (possibly eight).  They also tried and succeeded in maintaining a reasonable continuity within a universe that has parallel and alternate dimensions, time travel and mirror universes.  So, the show and its characters grew organically.  Lister by Series 7 is not the same man as Lister in Series I.  Same is true for Rimmer and Kryten.  Only Cat has maintained his characteristic and hilarious superficiality.  But in particular the writers spent a lot of time and energy showing the emotional and psychological growth of Rimmer and Lister.  And its this kind of writing and attention to detail that's elevated this show above the herd.

Now, the first thing you notice about Series X is that nothing resembles itself.  I don't care how high-tech the production value is, and it is (everything looks very expensive), the interior of the Red Dwarf and Blue Midget look like completely different ships.  Now, I'm not one to usually care about that kind of things, but even their cabins are off.  And what's with the logo all over everything?  Frankly, all the computer monitors and flashing gadgets and crap are just distracting more than anything else.  I know the production manager died in 2011, so that's certainly a factor, but Naylor should've insisted that the aesthetic match the first eight seasons.

Fine, that's a nitpick; but I mention it because it's the first thing you notice and because its endemic of the larger problems with this season.

The other thing you'll notice, especially if you watch this series back to back, is how old the actors look (true as well in ""Back to Earth"" and this is partly due to the way they style Rimmer to look like an old man).  Now, I know Craig Charles is a smoker, but WTF is what his suddenly deep Batman voice!  This, I believe, may have had to do with the sound editing, which gives each of them an unnaturally deep echo (in the documentary, he doesn't sound quite as bad.)  But it takes away from the performance cause it's not funny when the actor's delivery makes him sound like he's dying of throat cancer.

All of these gripes are minor and could've been overcome with great scripts, and with the second episode ""Father and Suns"" I thought they might.  But they don't.

Here are the serious issues with this season:

1. They're not looking for Kochanski.  The whole thrust of ""Back to Earth"" (which itself was hit or miss) is Dave's discovery that Kochanski didn't die after Season 8 and that he'd find her again.  In fact, the reason he leaves the simulated reality where he's with her is to do that very thing.  So, what is he doing in these six episodes to find her?  Absolutely nothing.  He's slobbering chutney on himself and on the console, getting drunk, and insulting Rimmer -- all of which is Season 1-2 Lister.  We're past this thematically and narrative-wise.  This is just dropping the ball in the writing dept, as if in some vain attempt to appease those who claim that only the first few seasons of Red Dwarf are worth watching, and it's bollocks.  But it's not even the worst aspect of this season...

2. That's reserved for the ridiculous revelation that this Rimmer (who appeared again in hologram form in ""Back to Earth"") is the same one from the early seasons!  That decision to jettison the nanobot-recreated Rimmer of Season 8 offscreen and bring back hologram Rimmer completely invalidates everything that was established up to and including Season 7, where he overcame his psychological handicaps to become Ace Rimmer.  That's just unforgivable in my eyes and pointless since they had the still screwed-up Season 8 Rimmer to work with.  And it really has the potential to ruin the whole Red Dwarf experience, which is why I say this season and ""Back to Earth"" can't have happened.  But that's not the only reason.

3. The writing is bad and the show isn't funny.  I know it was very rushed.  But conceptually, Naylor was off to begin with, and he should have employed Paul Alexander to help steer the ship in the right way.  Craig Charles said this season should've been called ""the search for Series 9,"" and he's got a point.  Series 8 had found a way to reestablish the old dynamic of the first three seasons WITHOUT ruining what came before.  It wasn't my favorite season, but it was an interesting new start, and it's where they should've continued.  Instead, and this is a problem with ""Back to Earth,"" Naylor ignores the fresh start they gave themselves in Season 8 without any rhyme or reason, and then he tries to do another reboot with the ""nine years later"" ""Back to Earth"" episode and it doesn't work.  And instead of being fixed, this mistake is exasperated by Season 10, which also tries to recreate Season 1.

But that's counterproductive, counterintuitive writing that reveals a lack of faith in your own work.  Seasons 1-3 were great.  But so were seasons 4-7, which in many ways were even better.  And they could have had the best of both worlds with what they started in season 8.  Foolishly, they didn't.

The fact is you can't go back in time.  Those vocal fans who only like the early seasons really need to be ignored.  They have them and can watch them any time.  But a good show, which this is, takes the time to GROW and develop, and they DID, and that should be honored.  So, stop trying to go back and recreate Season 1 and keep moving forward.

Let's look at this season episode by episode:

""Trojan"": This was partly funny, particularly with the way resentment makes Arnold, Howard and Crawford's faces freeze up.  We meet Rimmer's brother, Howard, who reveals he's a failure too.  And Naylor gets to vent his annoyance at having to be on hold forever on the phone, something we can all relate to (even if it doesn't make sense 3 million years from when that ad was first broadcast).  This isn't a bad episode overall, but there are some flaws, like the fact that Rimmer's older brother looks 20 years younger than him.  But a more serious issue is how Kryten is now being used for technical exposition.  Why?  It's not funny.  It slows down the narrative, and ultimately makes Kryten boring, something that was never the case until this season.  Kryten isn't a pedant, so why are they giving him all these long science speeches?  And they do it all season long!  Apart from that, this episode tonally belonged in Series IV or V.  Rating C

""Fathers and Suns"": Easily the best episode of this season.  Pree is great.  Craig Charles is also great playing father and son to himself.  The ending is a bit daft, but not bad.  My problem with the episode is that it would have been better served if Holly (meaning Hattie Hayridge, who is sorely missed) was the one who saved the day and came up with the paradigm that stopped Pree.  And it would've been great in the beginning to have them comparing how smart Pree is compared to Holly, upsetting her.  And then even after choosing Pree, Holly saves them anyway.  B-

""Lemons"": Naylor's thinly-disguised rant against religion could've been either funny or offensive, but because he writes it like a 15 year old (which makes me wonder if his son is helping write scripts now) it's just irritating and unfunny, and particularly if you have any kind of knowledge of the subjects he's ranting against, or if you don't find Jesus a douche, pacifism sissyish, and the Old Testament misogynistic.  The equivalent is like trying to write hard sci-fi but not having the first clue about science.  Or trying to write about China, but basing everything on stereotypes of how some people think China is.  That's how this episode comes across, and that's lazy writing.  I had a feeling this would be the case when they made fun of Cat for not knowing that Jesus would be 23 years old because the year is 23 AD; see, a basic Google search would've revealed that Jesus was born 2-5 years prior to the AD designation.  Oh, and the joke that bags weren't around in 23 AD is idiotic; bags have been around since ancient Egypt and probably earlier.  Judas himself -- one of the main jokes of the episode (after bags) -- is shown in the Bible carrying a bag around.  So, F- for being unfunny and lazy and not doing a smidgen of research on the subject matter.

""Entangled"": Lister loses Starbug and Rimmer in a card-game with GELFs.  This is a kind of recycling of ideas from earlier episodes (e.g., ""Infinity Crisis""), but isn't as creative or funny.  There is the legitimately hilarious quantum-entanglement scenario of Cat and Kryten, but the episode loses points for both the absurd idea that the BEGGS would choke to death (b/c Lister doesn't choke when playing poker) and that there would be a science lab where every scientist is always wrong.  Sorry, I'm just not buying that, not even for a comedy as cartoonish as this show sometimes gets (""Pete"" from season 8 being the worst offender until now).  And how about the fact that in the very next episode Lister is depressed that he's the last member of the human race (which is nonsense, btw), but there was a beautiful female specimen of the race onboard their very ship, who, when she accidentally fell out of the airlock, Lister made a joke!  And since when is he so callous?  F!

""Dear Dave"": Another episode that goes nowhere, establishes nothing, does nothing and was clearly designed to save money.  First of all, Dave being depressed about the loss of the human race belongs in seasons 1-3.  By now, there are not only clear remnants of the human race alive and well, starting with Kochanski.  There's also the entire crew of the resurrected Red Dwarf, many who left with Captain Hollister, and many who stayed on the ship (which clearly did not get destroyed at the end of season 8.)  So, forget like, oh I don't know, searching for Kochanski, instead Dave is moping around, pining over some old girlfriend we've never before heard of, who might have born his children... 3 million years ago.  WHO CARES ABOUT THIS!?!  And in the end, the whole ""drama"" of this episode didn't matter anyway.  Horrible.  F!

""The Beginning"": First off, why is this episode called this?  The first episode of Season I was called ""The End.""  There's no other relation to that first episode, and it's clearly neither an end, nor a beginning.  So, unless this is meant to be the final episode, why call it this?  Moving on, this is an idea that could've been great!  But it's not, and that's because it's underdeveloped and ultimately pointless.  We start off with a friendly simulant who we've never before met, but who everyone onboard knows well.  I guess that's the joke of the scene, although it feels like it's been tacked on for the sake of the joke.  Ok, fine; it leads to the attack of the simulant death ship, which leads to an Empire Strikes Back homage in an asteroid field.  Only Rimmer can save them, and this leads to his discovery that his father is, in fact, not his father, allowing him to purge his negative emotions.  We also learn in this episode that he's the hologram Rimmer from the first few seasons, which is a MAJOR character screw-up, because THAT Rimmer's already purged himself of his inner demons to become Ace Rimmer.  So, once again, this is an episode that belonged in Seasons 5 or 6.  It's also a big waste because they establish the Death Simulants as a potentially interesting group, and then fifteen minutes later they destroy them, which is a wasted opportunity for future storytelling.  Even the ""humping vending machine"" scene, which is funny, is kind of ripped off from the much ""humping Kryten"" scene in ""Polymorph.""  C.

Overall, this was a sad and terrible season that betrays the characters and the fans (at least those of us who've actually paid attention to the development of the characters) in some vain attempt to recapture the feel of the first few seasons but with better effects  Yet, all the great special effects can't cover up how rushed and ill-thought out this season was and how hollow these episodes feel.

Even the menus feel wrong.  After 8 seasons of a very clever menu design, we're given a lame ""modern"" menu that's boring, lacking charm and all the fun bits to it.  Even the documentary is awful!  Instead of having a secondary documentary for the special effects, which they used to have, they jammed it all into the one documentary which makes it really boring and hard to sit through!

Everyone's entitled to an off-period.  And hopefully Naylor will get his stuff together because if he doesn't, then Red Dwarf for me will have ended.

The next season should be arc-driven, focused on the search for Kochanski; it needs to restore the characters to who they were at the end of Season 8, and explain what happened in the interim that led to Kochanski leaving in the first place; it needs to explain what happened to the resurrected Rimmer and how he became hologram Rimmer, and ignore any insinuation that he's the Rimmer from seasons 1-7.  They should also bring back Hattie Hayridge as Holly, and go more for the style and mood of Season 7, which allowed for more character-driven, dramatic elements alongside the kind of humor and wild storytelling elements we saw in Seasons 5 and 6.  Something we haven't seen are overarching villains, so that might prove interesting and different as well.",1427760000,4,14313,4.681490384615385

Each episode from season 10 stands alone with memorable lines, from the one about the Swedish man in a car swerving to avoid the moose and hitting a tree, to Rimmer making peace with his father's expectations.  Can't think of a single episode of the final season that didn't wind up leaving me on the floor from laughing so hard.

5373767,5,B009Z59778,"It's Red Dwarf, one of the three all-time greatest shows on TV - so of course it gets five stars.  And episode for episode, Series X is quite possibly the all time best Series in Red Dwarf's history.  Doug Naylor's writing is some of his best ever, his direction equally outstanding; and the gags are some of the wittiest and best in its 10 Series run.  So what's to get nostalgic over?

It took me a long time to realize what's missing.  And it took me a long time to pinpoint what changed over time to give the impression that something's missing.  Then it finally dawned on me.  In a word, what's missing is spontaneity - or, more precisely, the appearance of spontaneity.  And what created the loss of spontaneity is Craig Charles' growth as an actor.

It's always (at least for me) been the character of Dave Lister who made the show what it was - and thereby hangs a tale.  Because as Craig Charles has gone from a first-rate natural comic actor to a truly accomplished comic actor, this evolution has necessarily changed the tenor of the character he portrays - Dave Lister.  Consequently, some of the old gags fall flat - though wisely the show has staked out new ground rather than simply keeping the same running gags.  Those that have been kept - such as Dave Lister's essential slobbiness - do not quite carry the same whimsical charm on a more mature Dave Lister as portrayed by a more mature Craig Charles.  Dave's grungy socks, mentioned only in the ""Lemons"" episode, fail to garner a laugh because they no longer fit the mature Dave Lister.  Similarly, Dave's sloppy eating habits, as evidenced in the ""Entangled"" episode, seem oddly out of place - even a bit obscene because they no longer flow as naturally from Dave's persona.  And the Series' only reference to his pining away for Kochanski, also in the ""Entangled"" episode, seems out of place, if not downright perfunctory - almost like an ""in-joke"" kind of thing thrown in to say to the viewers ""Remember that?""

In the episode ""Fathers and Suns,"" Craig Charles renders a truly bravura performance as both Dave Lister Sr and Dave Lister Jr in a genuinely original tete-a-tete via a tape recording.  But even though Dave Lister Sr proceeds to get smashed in one of the best drunken sequences ever filmed, he evinces a sophistication above and beyond the level we're used to seeing in Lister.

In the final analysis, what's most missing in Series X is Dave Lister's cockiness.  His most characteristic line - and perhaps his defining quality - is ""Spin On It!"" from Series V's ""The Inquisitor.""  It seems impossible that the more mature, more accomplished Dave Lister could ever say that, and truly mean it.",1403136000,,2677,4.667377398720682

5373771,4,B009Z59778,"I'm glad this tenth season of Red Dwarf exists, even if it's a bit...weird? Dated? I can't come up with the right word.

As fans will know, the show has a strange production history. The final regular season was number eight, back in 1999. Red Dwarf then vanished for 10 years. It returned in 2009 as a miniseries called ""Back to Earth,"" shot on location with a cinematic look and no laugh track. Then Red Dwarf X came out in 2012, featuring a return to cheap studio-bound sets and audience laughter in the background. What's the upshot of all this? That different seasons can feel very different, and indeed barely related to each other.

And it's not just the production style that shifts. The storyline changes as well, at the writer's whim. The original concept was that Dave Lister, the protagonist, was the last human being alive, trying to reach Earth to see if he could salvage something of its civilization. Later, the writer introduced Lister's girlfriend from another dimension, making him no longer the last human alive. Then, they resurrected the entire crew of the Red Dwarf spaceship, raising the total number of living humans to hundreds (or thousands?) These changes radically altered the show's tone and themes.

But now, in Red Dwarf X, Lister is again (mysteriously) referred to as the last human being alive. What happened to his resurrected shipmates? Nobody knows. What happened to his girlfriend? She's wandering around the Universe somewhere, so there are clearly at least two living humans. And is Lister still trying to return to Earth and restore some semblance of civilization? That's also unclear.

In short, Red Dwarf X resolves absolutely none of the show's central conflicts or questions, and indeed seriously muddles its continuity. So, in a sense, there's no reason for this season to exist...except, of course, to provide us with six more funny episodes. And hey, it achieves that goal. Most of the episodes are good; I particularly enjoy ""Dear Dave"" and ""Fathers and Suns,"" which add some good tidbits to our understanding of Lister's character. (Alas, the other regular characters don't get quite as much good material - Cat and Kryten, in particular, are short changed.) And while the scripts aren't consistently funny, there are some priceless moments; I'll never forget Lister flirting with a vending machine, or accidentally destroying a control panel by dripping BBQ sauce on it.

How about the Blu ray itself? Well, the print is great. These episodes were shot with very-high-definition cameras, and it shows - for good and ill. (The high level of detail is nice, but it does tend to make the sets and makeup look really fake!) The special features are solid, too. The highlight is a two-hour (!) making-of documentary, which delves into various production problems that almost derailed the whole season. There are also plenty of deleted scenes and bloopers to enjoy.

So yeah...I recommend this purchase. It's a nice, nostalgic slice of Red Dwarf, and faithful to the old episodes (unlike, say, the radically changed reboot of Doctor Who). But if we ever get a Red Dwarf XI, I'd like it to deal more directly with the show's long-running storylines. At this rate, Lister is never gonna reproduce--!",1401235200,2,3243,4.974169741697417

I suggest using amazon prime video or netflix to watch all of the seasons of Red Dwarf. Smart witty an dry british humor.

5373800,5,B009Z59778,"Season ten of ""Red Dwarf"" was probably the show's best season since seasons five or six.  With season seven, you had the replacement of Rimmer with Kochanski.  With season eight, you had the resurrection of the dead crew.  And, the ""Back to Earth"" episodes focused on the crew visiting 21st century Earth.  While seasons seven, eight and, nine were funny and had their moments; the modifications to the show's original premise (a small group of isolated bachelors marooned in deep space) during those three seasons changed the show's feel.  The episodes were funny and entertaining in their own way; but, seasons seven, eight, and nine simply did not feel like classic ""Red Dwarf.""

Season ten restored the show's original premise; and, the resulting episodes were far better than what I thought I could have expected.  With the exception of the absence of Holly, the season ten episodes felt very much like old ""Red Dwarf.""  The cast might have been a bit older; but, their characters were spot on; and, the stories were really funny.  Season ten showed that there is still some life in ""Red Dwarf.""

This time around we have only four major cast member, our core four if you will: Lister, Cat, Kryten, and Rimmer (as a hologram again). The boys are back on the Dwarf, not in prison, and the rest of the crew is absent, including Kochanski, as is Holly. For those wondering, there is never an explanation given as to the resolution of Series 8's cliffhanger ending, nor why Rimmer is a hologram again.

Until I caught Season 10 and then it was back to the classic Red Dwarf. Season 7-9 had the absurdity, but it didn't have the sharp, unexpected writing of the early seasons where anything goes but it's still completely in character. It's the characters of Red Dwarf that have always mattered, and everyone: Lister, Rimmer, Cat and Kryten are back in prime form. People complaining about continuity need to go back and rewatch the first few seasons. The CHARACTERS that made Red Dwarf what it was are back, along with the humor, the sarcasm and the comradery (or lack thereof). Just when I thought an episode had lost me it would zig-zag back in a way I did not expect. It was that element of surprise that won me over in season 1, even with the cheesy special effects. Note: I miss Holly, both Norman and Hattie. I wish one of them could have made the return trip, and maybe they still can. But bottom line: I had written this show off a few years before, but now I'm eagerly awaiting series 11. For me, the Boys from the Dwarf are back!",1372723200,,1144,4.42654028436019

5373843,4,B009Z59778,"This series was meant to take place just before the older season where Holly resurrected the ship and the original crew, and Lister and Rimmer went to jail.  It does not fill that entire gap, but follows some of the crew's adventures during that time.  The original cast is back, except Holly... that's right, no snarky ship's computer this time around.  Otherwise it's basically more of the same:  a crew of silly and slightly insane misfits trying to avoid suicide by boredom in deep space.

This one lacks some of the punch that made the previous seasons so much fun.  The writing is a bit dull and the acting is a bit dry; there isn't as much energy here as in the older ones.  Still, it's good for a few laughs.  The show is still done on a ridiculously low budget but this time it looks like they spent it all on computer graphics and model shots instead of cheesy costumes and set pieces.

So if you absolutely loved the other Red Dwarf series, sure go ahead and get this one to finish off your collection.  You'll enjoy it.  But if you were only mildly impressed by the older ones then you should not expect to be entertained by this.",1371081600,,1142,4.390476190476191

""He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer,
 More reliable than a garden strimmer,
 He's never been mistaken for Yul Brynner;
 He's not bald, and his head doesn't glimmer.

 Master of the wit and the repartee,
 His command of space directives is uncanny.
 How come he's such a genius? Don't ask me!
 Ask Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer.
 He's also a fantastic swimmer,
 And if you play your cards right,
 Then he just might come round for dinner.""

I was trapped there until I had to put together a makeshift interdenominational teleporter made from the remains of Rimmer dolls and parts taken from the moving cart I was forced to sit in. As it was not perfect I was thrust into many different dimensions where I gathered more parts to fix my teleporter until I was finally able to find my way home. Most terrible experience of my life.

5373892,5,B009Z59778,"I only watched the first three episodes of the six total, but I found myself laughing again from these guys. One running gag was predictable, like when Rimmer asked Lister a question, and then asks Kryten the same question, I knew Cat was just about to make his entrance to be asked the very same question. One scene had the actor Chris Barrie playing Rimmer setting up a joke for the punchline which I thought was taking too painfully long knowing how Rimmer would react anyway. Still the faces he makes is pretty funny. Danny John-Jules still does his trademark cat sounds and dancing around. However, the writing was funny for quite a few things.

Also the writers are great at placing a seemingly unimportant action or item somewhere near the beginning or middle, and then surprising me with it at the end of the show. I recall during my college days when I took a small course in acting and directing, that each action I did had to serve some purpose to move the story along. My example was I used a trap door to keep out an unwanted visitor. The teacher wondered why, and after everyone forgotten about the trap door, it comes back in the end of the act to serve another purpose. That is how the writing is with Red Dwarf. Some trivial thing that one just passes by without much thought winds up becoming the whole ""Ah ha!"" item at the end.

They've upgraded the sets while still keeping the same feel of how they used to create the sets. For instance, Rimmer and Lister's sleeping quarters (Or is it still the officers' quarters?) got a big revamp. They still have the top bunk and bottom bunk, but that is about all I can really recognize from the old series. Also the bunks are painted red instead of the gray as well.

The lawn chairs that they used on Starbug have been replaced with high backed rolling computer chairs with a flexible neck LED flashlight on them. They are using USB flash drives now as a key prop in one episode. In that same episode, Lister is using an old corded phone with the opening for the cord visible. One must be a die hard fan to understand why this is such a throwback to the old series. The old series was shot on a very limited budget (This one probably was as well), and they used a lot of mundane things in clever ways, and sometimes the mundane item stuck out like a sore thumb. They brought back that little aspect of it and I find myself loving the guys for it even more!",1361577600,,2418,4.368888888888889

5373900,5,B009Z59778,"First, I should let you know who this review is coming from. I've been watching Red Dwarf for over a decade now, since I discovered it on PBS (where it was broadcast in the U.S.). I typically put Red Dwarf on when I go to sleep each night, and can quote pretty much any scene from memory. I am a serious Dwarfer.

I wasn't sure what to expect of series 10 after series 9, ""Back to Earth."" While I did enjoy series 9, it wasn't exactly the Red Dwarf I fell in love with. I enjoyed seeing them back together again, they all did a good job getting back into character, and there were some good jokes in there. But it wasn't the same, you know? The structure of the story was different, the scenes were shot differently, and the absence of a live audience OR laugh track did seem to take something away.

I have now watched each episode 3-4 times and I'm very happy to report that none of these issues are present in series 10. This is a genuine set of Red Dwarf episodes. Plenty of soon-to-be-classic plotlines and hilarious quips. I laughed out loud many times, and it is a joy to see these guys playing their classic characters again. I'd bet each of these episodes will become a classic in its own right, as Red Dwarf episodes do.

Also, this being the Blu-Ray version, I have to say Red Dwarf looks good in HD. I'm only watching in 720p but it's still very noticeable. That being said, they did a great job with the set design and despite the uptick in visual clarity it feels like we've come home to Red Dwarf. It doesn't look exactly like the old series (and it couldn't, really, being different sets on much newer video equipment) but it is much closer to say, series 3, 4, and 5 than it is to 9.",1361145600,2,1700,4.2407407407407405

5373920,5,B009Z59778,"-No Spoilers!

This is literally the best 178 minutes of airtime that I have seen on my Television in a longtime.
Red X is very very very good. End of review.

Seriously I really enjoyed this even though I went into it not knowing what to expect. Back To Earth was very different in tone than past Red Dwarf stuff. Where as Season 8 of Red Dwarf was bigger and wilder than the previous Red Dwarf stuff.

Red X goes back even before Season 8 and trims down the fat of that Season in favor of the tightly paced storyline that engulfed us during the mid 1990s (Seasons 4 thru 7).

In X we get the same great adventures and plenty of proper laughs but now we get it from mentally matured versions of the same characters we have loved over the 25 year period.

Speaking of 'matured' I have to add that the costumes, make up and set lighting in this series makes the crew look younger and fresher than they looked in Back To Earth and maybe even season 8.

The production quality alone is 5 stars in itself! When you see the making off in the extra DVD chapters then you will realize how gray and old everyone has gotten. Yet on screen Cat looks like he was cut and pasted from Season 1 cat and Rimmer and Dave look as young as ever.

I will add that having the laugh track/live audience in X was a blessing! I understand in Back To Earth it was dropped for budgetary reasons but it never bothered me in Back To Earth because that show was very serious in tone and theme. Honestly adding a laugh track on Back To Earth would have been like adding a laugh track at a funeral progression.

Here the laugh track is fresh, appropriate and makes the viewer feel like they are inside the ship with the crew. Most new viewers to Dwarf will not understand nor appreciate the laugh track since laugh tracks have been long abandon in many modern day sitcoms since the late 1990s (you have the advent of annoying Reality TV shows and faux Reality Sitcom Shows, like Modern Family, to thank for that).

As an long time fan of the show I welcome the laugh track!

I don't want to give any spoilers but I will add that my one minor gripe with X is I sort of wanted at least to see Lister's love interest appear during Red X. Back To Earth ended with her being important to the existance of Lister and I wanted that story to be revisited.

Still it was a very good season and perhaps one of the best. Looking forward to XI!",1359763200,,2402,4.211328976034858

I had to laugh at one thing, though.  Let's ignore, for the moment, the fact that the show takes place 3 million+ years into the future.  Let's pretend it's taking place in its original time frame (late 22nd century), since that's the mentality that Lister and Rimmer still have.  Rimmer is trying to get Lister to fill out some PAPERWORK.  Actual printed pieces of paper.  Now, I realize that the entire plot of that episode would fall down if this became ""forms on an electronic device"" (like a tablet or whatever) but I'm finding it very hard to believe that by the late 22nd century they'd still be filling out forms on pieces of paper!

I've met most of the actors and talked to them briefly during a special lunch/dinner event held in San Jose and organized by KTEH.  I have all the series on DVD/BD including the missing series 9 ;).

I did enjoy Red Dwarf the Movie but the actors were still getting used to being back together and it wasn't as ""fluid"" (timing was a little off) an interaction as series 1-8.  However, series 10 has successfully captured those early days of Red Dwarf only with a more modern swing.  All the actors were ""on time"" and in ""synch"" (literally).  I think the move to the live audience was key to bring the ""timing"" back into the show and motivating the actors performances -- if felt much more like the original series 1-3.

Red Dwarf fans are going to buy this one I expect but those who have not seen the show should not be confused about what's going on.  I do miss Holly though and even Kochanski. Still the core four are here and just as amusing as the original.,1520035200,,475,4.1521739130434785
8545594,5,B009Z59778,Absolutely Hilarious!  This series really holds up over time.  The zany antics of the crew of the Red Dwarf is not to be missed.  One thing different from the earlier series -- they filmed the episodes with a live audien!!ce!  Great!,1519084800,,233,4.609756097560975

It's one of those shows you can watch over and over again, still laugh and never get sick of. This is a pretty good set. ""Fathers and Suns"" is hilarious!!!",1515542400,,276,4.036363636363636
