8276769,5,B001AD6UGY,My late fatherinlaw was in this picture as one of the Miners so we enjoy watching this film.,1503792000,,92,4.166666666666667
8276770,5,B001AD6UGY,Excellent story!!,1486252800,,17,8.0
8276771,4,B001AD6UGY,"Good acting and solid director. Milland is perfectly cast, Patricia Roc is truly radiant. Enjoyable within the context of circa 1950. Completely viewable print is adequate. Better than expected for an unknown film resurrected from obscurity.",1434326400,,241,5.722222222222222
8276772,4,B001AD6UGY,"Ray Milland stars as an American who journeys to England, Scotland, and Wales to find out about the death of his brother during WWII. His search turns up unexpected surprises including a lovely Englishwoman played by Patricia Roc. In the film, you see how two men deal with the painful price of knowledge.

Jacques Tourneur does an excellent job moving the story along, but it's what he does with the atmosphere, the dappled light, and the wind that makes this an especially memorable film.",1426204800,2,490,4.833333333333333
8276773,4,B001AD6UGY,"Though this is clearly a low-end offering from Sinister, the print quality is relatively ok. There are a few jumps between scenes but it is better than I was expecting. The insert looks pretty ordinary but, overall, I recommend this release.",1391904000,4,241,4.902439024390244
8276774,2,B001AD6UGY,I ttok a chance on this movie because I like the cast and it's vintage. A mistake. A bad film badly presented and packaged. A charity shop donation.,1356825600,2,148,4.321428571428571
8276775,1,B001AD6UGY,"My rating is of the quality of the stream, which is very bad. I stopped watching it, so I can't say anything about the movie itself.",1356048000,2,132,4.115384615384615
8276776,5,B001AD6UGY,"This is one of Ray Milland's lesser-known films, but a rather intriguing story of a man seeking revenge for the murder of his brother, but with a not untypical twist in the climactic scene.",1326758400,8,189,4.588235294117647
8276777,5,B001AD6UGY,"I found the movie a very good study of human nature.  The film gives one a feel for the after-war atmosphere in England, and, I dare say in Europe, too.",1318204800,12,152,4.066666666666666
