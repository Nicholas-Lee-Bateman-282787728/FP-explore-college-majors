Exercises range in difficulty from 'Eschappe, sous-sous, tombe, releve arabesque', to 'Continuous pirouettes from 5th position'.  As in The Art of Pointework-3, each exercise is thoroughly explained with the aid of close-ups, slow-motions, freeze frames, and voice-overs, during which Mr. Jhung points out precisely what should be done, and calls attention to common mistakes that make it impossible to do the exercises correctly.  And, this enlightening commentary, combined with the musical background provided by Scott Killian, and the superb manner in which ABT soloist Michele Wiles demonstrates the exercises, makes this video a delight to view and an invaluable learning instument.",1222560000,5,930,5.535211267605634
