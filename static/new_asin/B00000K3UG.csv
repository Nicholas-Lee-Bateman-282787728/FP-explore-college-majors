1241157,5,B00000K3UG,"Ok, so I was flipping through the channels one summer day, and I couldn't find anything on. Suddenly (I must of pushed a wrong button or something) but anyway, this western movie started showing on the screen. So I figured ""Why Not?"" so As I watched the movie Ronald Reagon was in it with Rhonda Fleming and Bruce Bennett. ( I don't know about you but all I knew was our former president was an actor! (Until then I thought he was just a stuffy politician. Well, to my surprise he was really good. The way that the writer/director had layed out the movie was quite wonderful. I mean I've seen lots of western movies before, (because of my big brother) but this one had me on the edge of my seat. It really surprised me how the changes in the plot work toward the end. Needless to say this one is my favorite western. I think you should give this movie a chance and then you'd see how really good it is.",982800000,6,902,4.219653179190751

Almost passed the small listing by until I checked further and realized it was the Reagan film as the pic Amazon uses for it is of a character that gets killed off in the first half hour!  I also enjoy watching Reagan ride one of his own horses in the movie after being told repeatedly by the film's wranglers that the thoroughbred mare would be unable to handle the heat of the high desert where they were filming.  The mare did just fine while the wranglers' horses were the ones having problems with the heat!,1425168000,,546,4.44

1241334,4,B00000K3UG,"In 1862 Captain Vance Britton (Ronald Reagan) leads  a band of Confederate cavalry in a series of raids against the North capturing Yankee supplies sent east along the Santee Fe trail before they can reach their destination at Union outpost at Fort Point, San Gill in Arizona. Here the owner of the local trading post Sam McQuade (John Ridgely) is dealing with the Apache Indians. The Union Army of the North despatch  a small detachment West under Colonel Jeb Britton (Bruce Bennett) to stop the Rebel raids. Jeb being unaware that his brother is the Confederate leader! McQuade introduces Jeb to his wife Julie (Rhonda Fleming) thinking she knows him from back East, when in fact it was his brother Vance she knew! Julie leaves her husband and McQuade tries to negotiate with the Indians to attack the Rebels. Out on a raid Vance and his patrol come across a couple of McQuade's wagons still burning as a result of an Apache raid, nearby the body of Sam McQuade was found on him was a letter from Washington DC saying that a Union officer  was on his way to talk to Chief Grey Cloud  the Apache leader. Vance ambushes the Union major and two sergeants and exchange identities with them and the trio set off to meet Grey Cloud disguised as Union soldiers. Unfortunately  Grey Cloud sees through their masquerade and they are given 24 hours to go to the jail in San Gill where a group of Apaches are being held accused of the murder of Sam McQuade. Following a series of misadventures Vance fails to release the Apache prisoners but does manage to escape with his two sergeants having crossed paths with Julie and his brother Jeb. With the Apaches still in jail Grey Cloud attacks in force. Vance and his Confederate Cavalry hearing of the attack ride to the rescue in an heroic cavalry charge!

Also released as CAVALRY CHARGE (1962) following its box-office success on its initial release. Regarded as one of  Pine-Thomas productions (B-picture unit of Paramount Pictures) finest films. Rhonda Fleming a beautiful redhead who graced the screen for many a western and other outdoor adventures. The supporting cast included Noah Beery Jr., who could also be found in countless westerns, but was perhaps best known on TV as Jim Rockford's dad in THE ROCKFORD FILES (1974 - 1980). Ronald Reagan used his own horse 'Tess' throughout this western. For the 40 year-old Reagan his greatest role was yet to come, at the time of this movie he was President of the Screen Actors Guild and later moving into mainline politics he became Governor of California in 1966. In 1970 he was elected as the 40th President of the United States of America, surviving a assassination attempt early in his presidency, he went on to serve two full terms. Not bad for a 'B' movie cowboy actor!

1241369,5,B00000K3UG,"Yep, this is my favorite Ronald Reagan movie.

Cavalry? Yes. Military? Yes. Fun? Yes.

I've watched it a couple of times since purchasing it here on Amazon, and  I thought it was worth both my hard-earned sheckles and popcorn time.

Older westerns seem to be a turn-off with the psuedo-elite/liberal, extremism in America today. Oh, we were terrible to the Indians, we tricked the poor French, we stole the whole country and we should be ashamed of ourselves? Who's we, sucker? My grandparents were all immigrants that left crappy European countries around the 1900's because of extremism. And since when do you watch movies for political activism? You're supposed to watch them for escapism! Being a moderate, I detest extremist, especially when they attack something as simple and trival as a freaking movie or entire decades of freaking movies.

Chill, it's not real.

It's just a movie, fiction; entertainment.

And entertainment it was. Reagan is so larger than life and The War Between the States as we call it in Kentucky is shown about as fair as you're gonna get. I love this one and it compliments the grim atmosphere of ""Gettysburg"" and the whimsical turn of ""The Undefeated"" nicely.

I like all kinds of flicks, good ones, bad ones, serious ones and silly ones.",1351900800,6,1273,4.888372093023256

1241371,3,B00000K3UG,"This film deserves a much better release than this one from Ivy Video.  The original title ""Last Outpost"" has been removed and replaced with ""Cavalry Charge"" for this re-release by another distributor.  All references to Paramount Pictures have been removed.  The quality starts out good, but then worsens with print damage and splices.  This made it somewhat annoying to watch.  Hard to recommend this edition.",1325116800,7,411,5.2615384615384615
1241372,4,B00000K3UG,This first Western starring Ronald Reagan  is loaded with Action and a fine cast. Rhonda Fleming  is the  beautiful lost love.  The only thing that I fault  is the fact that the film  should have been  restored so as to prevent those  spots where there are drop outs.  Bravo to Amazon for carrying the movie and letting people buy it.,1322438400,,334,4.433333333333334
1241373,3,B00000K3UG,"I grew up in Texas and was always perplexed at how little attention most histories give to the Civil War battles beyond the big famous ones back east. Pea Ridge Arkansas, anyone? How about the ""battle"" of Lawrence Kansas [more accurately labeled a massacre of civilians by Missouri bushwhackers] For me the most interesting campaigns occurred far from Pennsylvania or Va.
You can read about them elsewhere in great depth but there were CSA loyalists who fought at Glorietta Pass New Mexico. Heck, Arizona was actually claimed as a Confederate territory and yep, there were battles fought there as well.

I was led to view this film from the SCV website.
I live now in SC and of course the War Between the States is ever present in one way or another, certainly any time a politician complains about meddling from Washington.
This film is light entertaining fair. The rebel troops are entirely too well outfitted and dressed to actually be a unit from Texas. Yep this is another CW film made in the Mojave desert or maybe Arizona/Nevada. The dialogue does make reference to Jo Shelby who attempted an invasion of NM from Texas. As befits the era it was made in (post WWII) the NCO characters seem to be a bit on the buffoonish side [I suspect this was the subtle way egghead WWII draftees chose to get back at the men who trained them during their time in uniform]

We never really get a clear grasp of why the Reagan character chose to go with the South and no one Union or Confederate ever discusses slavery. We're told that he and his brother were both Westpoint men. Ea chose a different uniform.

No one in this movie is ever really shot in battle until the final scenes and then it is Indians killing whites. The Indians actually breach the barricades and it looks bad for the blue coats and who comes riding in to save the day? The Confederates!

 The opening scene has Union troops taking a brief swim thinking no rebel troops are in the AO. That's when we see Reagan and his confederates ride up and capture the Federals without firing a shot. Hard to believe anything like that scene could have happened in the actual war. I think in the real war the rebels would have killed the Union men. Instead Reagan has his troops pillage the Union supply wagons and then set fire to both the wagons and the swimming soldiers uniforms. The dejected Union men have to walk into their outpost to the laughter and ridicule of onlooking garrison troops. [The ""walk back to post with no uniform"" happens twice!]

Later Reagan has tied up two shopkeepers and when Federal troops enter the store they find RR behind the counter with an apron on. The vintage Reagan sense of humor which would be on view for all from the Oval Office was easily manifested in this scene: ""Say you're not the man who normally works here.. where are [name forgotten]?""
""Oh I'm filling in they're both tied up right now""
And of course they are ea there under the counter with gagged mouths and wrists tied.
To summarize this was an idealized version of a remote and poorly documented aspect of the CW. Extremely unrealistic though quite entertaining. RR was never true leading man material but he handled the love scenes with ""Julie"" well enough.
As an added bonus, we see the Confederate 2nd in command is none other than Hugh Beaumont-- yep, the Beaver's Daddy was a CSA man!",1295481600,,3347,4.588628762541806
1241374,5,B00000K3UG,"This film was well-made! The storyline is as follows: Vance Britton is an officer in the Confederate army. He is sent out West to stir things up for the Union. While he's there he meets his brother Jeb, who is the commander of a Union fort. Vance ends up pretending to be a Union officer so he can free some Indian prisoners to keep the Apaches from attacking. Jeb catches him but lets him go. Also in the same town is Vance's old flame, Julie. She is angry because he left her at the beginning of the war. He just thought he was doing what was best, but she has a hard time believing him about anything after that. Eventually the Apaches attack because the prisoners were not freed. They are about to win the battle when Vance and his cavalry come to the rescue (hence the title). Of course everything ends happily. I thought the battle scene was well done. In short, this is a great film.",1104278400,6,890,4.303571428571429
1241375,5,B00000K3UG,"CAVALRY CHARGE is actually a film from Paramount,called THE LAST OUTPOST.

7914160,3,B00000K3UG,"RELEASED IN 1951 and directed by Lewis R. Foster, The Last Outpost (re-released in 1962 as Cavalry Charge) chronicles events in Arizona during the Civil War where two brothers, officers for the Confederacy and Union (Ronald Reagan and Bruce Bennett), have to settle their differences to protect the outpost/town of San Gil from an Indian attack. Rhonda Fleming plays the formers maybe babe.

The old-fashioned style of filmmaking takes a while to acclimate to if you're used to newer movies. It doesnt help that the talky, contrived story is so convoluted that it takes forever to become engrossed into the characters and events. But there are some highlights: Its great seeing Reagan when he was young; and curvy Fleming is jaw-dropping. The climax is action-packed, but with those eye-rolling stunt hits (i.e. someone gets shot or arrowed and throws his hands in the air in a melodramatic manner, falling to the ground).

THE FILM RUNS 1 hour & 29 minutes and was shot in Old Tucson and surrounding areas (e.g. Sierrita Mountains).
