I would not recommend this unless you've already read a basic book on Kabbalah first ( The Carolyn Myss book on The Anatomy of the Soul - doesn't count either! )  You could call this step 2 on Kabbalah path, that's about where I am there so this was good for me.  He does recommend his book on it next, which I will get too for the next depth. Being a mystic already it was food to broaden my understanding.",1465430400,,466,4.0989010989010985
