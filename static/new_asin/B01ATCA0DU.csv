7608327,2,B01ATCA0DU,"This is a 2014 made for TV movie rated PG. As a child, Rebecca's;s dad goes missing one Christmas. He was a policeman and was on a case. Years later when her mother dies, she comes home and discovers Christmas cards from an unknown sender. She hires a private investigator and goes Nancy Drew over the letters. Not too hard to figure out in this formula disaster.

Ryan James Bittle, who plays the detective is clearly the love child of Caspar Van Dien. The acting wasn't there. The film had a few cute moments, but otherwise it was fairly lame. For those who would like a simple Nancy Drew/ Scooby-Doo Lifetime mystery, this is the film. I had a hard time stomaching the whole thing.",1463788800,2,684,4.472
