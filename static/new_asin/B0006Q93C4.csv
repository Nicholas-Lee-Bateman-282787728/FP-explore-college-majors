2191175,5,B0006Q93C4,"At a time when television is dominated by crappy reality show and the family hour is almost extinct, this NICKELODEON sitcom that stars Drake Bell and Josh Peck is a truly pleasant escape from all that.  I really have not heard of this sitcom until Drake Bell's appearance in the 2005 version of ""YOURS, MINE AND OURS"".  But the first time I saw it, I was immediately hooked on it.  Josh Peck is my favorite on the show.  This is a very funny show the whole family will enjoy and this DVD gives you the opportunity to check out the show's early episodes.  I highly recommend it. Sometime in the near future, hopefully, Paramount and Nick will come out with the complete first season of DRAKE AND JOSH on DVD Box Set.",1148774400,19,716,4.393939393939394
2191176,5,B0006Q93C4,"This was a great purchase.  My children 2,4 and 5 all enjoy watching this time and time again.  My daughter who is 4 really enjoys the music and likes Megan and Drake.  I would recommand this to everyone.",1141689600,5,204,4.315789473684211
2191177,4,B0006Q93C4,"Personally, I enjoy the Drake & Josh tv show immensely. It is surprisingly witty and funny, not something someone older would expect from Nickelodeon. I, myself (an 18 year old) enjoy the show immensely along with some of my friends of the same age. This show is perfect for someone who is looking for a tv show that doesn't rely on crude humor in order to get laughs. It's funny and lighthearted. An enjoyable experience for all ages.

This specific product though, while capturing the show itself is somewhat limiting in the fact that it is only 2 episodes.

If you like the show you would love to own these two episodes, specially since the pilot is rarely aired on tv. Personally, I own it, and I find myself watching the episodes over and over again.

Honestly, the one problem with this product is that it just makes you wish for more episodes.",1140912000,19,850,4.542483660130719

2191179,5,B0006Q93C4,"I love this show ever since my little cousin introduced it to me.  I am 17 but I really don't care, I still love it and of course I LOVE Drake, he is REALLY hot!  The one thing I don't like is that Meghan always ruins it for Drake and Josh and she gets away with things.",1130976000,10,270,3.719298245614035

2191181,1,B0006Q93C4,"When I first saw the commercial, I thought it was going to be really good. Then I saw the show and it was a shame. It's just a cheap imatation of Kenan and Kel. Except they have better morals, they don't have an ugly guy on the show who cannot sing.

  The producers act like since Drake is cute (yeah, right) he'll always do better than is clumsy stepbrother. They have all these annoying assumptions that get on my nerves. Also, I hate the way Megan always gets away with things, too.

  The storylines are bad. The characters are bad and not funny. The voices are bad. Don't buy the DVD.",1128729600,9,590,4.27027027027027

2191210,5,B0006Q93C4,"I came across this show by chance.

I am middle aged and don't watch kid shows or any cartoons for that matter.

It's embarrasasing to admit, but I love this show. I can't remember the last time I saw such a (new) funny show. The only series I normally watch is ""Heroes"" but I now have a TiVo season pass to ""Drake and Josh"". The physical comedy (especially Josh) is hilarious. The pratfalls of these two had me laughing like an 8 year old. Josh's timing and delivery is instinctive. His facial expressions alone will make you howl. I predict he is going to be a big star like Jim Carrey one day --- no, bigger.

When these guys are older, I think they could have a very successful movie career as a comedic duo along the lines of Curtis/Lemmon, Abbott & Costello, Martin/Lewis, Gibson/Glover.",1206316800,,793,4.455172413793103
2191211,5,B0006Q93C4,"I became interested in this show after watching a couple of episodes in a local channel. It got my attention because it made me laugh A LOT! Since then I started to follow it and to love it. Ok, ok....it is for kids (and by the way, I am 25), but it has everything you want in good TV -great chemistry between the leading characters, silly and funny situations, simpleness and above all I think what makes it great is that it has charisma- I hope they release more DVD's in the future. Mmmm...another thing I must add is that I think this show got me because I see so much of me in Josh -lol-.Drake's character, on the other hand is quite the opposite, but one can't help but to love them both.",1195603200,,694,4.186567164179104
2191212,5,B0006Q93C4,"Drake and Josh Suddenly Brothers is hilarious. It shows us Drake and Josh from the beginning. Drake is not happy about having a new brother because lets face it, Josh is really goofy, but as Drake gets to know him he finds out that he really does love him and from there comedy insues. This movie only has 4 episodes, but it also comes with some entertaining bloopers.",1192147200,,368,4.426470588235294
2191213,5,B0006Q93C4,"If your kids are fans of the Drake and Josh TV show, you'll probably want to add this to your collection.

The DVD contains episodes from the series and is typical of this type of program for older kids and pre-teens. Each episode deals with a different topic or situation typical to kids around that age -- though admitedly, some of the issues and situations would only come up if you lived in CA or you were progeny of yuppie parents.

The episodes are highly entertaining and there's good chemistry between the actors. Each episode has an underlying message, but it's never preachy nor so obvious that it feels like they're beating you over the head with it.

My son loves this, and I even find it entertaining. The only question, is when are more episodes going to be released. You'll want those, too.",1191196800,3,805,4.576388888888889
2191214,5,B0006Q93C4,"I think this is a great show, but I think they need to release a season set instead of doing Disney Channel-style 4-episode releases.

2191221,5,B0006Q93C4,"Drake and Josh is my favorite show on Nickelodeon. Even though there are no DVD season boxsets out yet, this DVD came out in early 2005 and I bought it. Here is my review ( I have no life ).

[*] Indicates a ""DVD Great""

----------

[*]Pilot: 4.5/5 This is the first episode of the series. Drake and Josh become step brothers and Drake realizes that Josh is a real loser in school. In a case of mistaken identity, Josh has to fight a ""jealous boyfriend"".

[*]Dune Buggy: 4.5/5 Drake and Josh get a dune buggy from Drake's friend, Trevor, but find out that it doesn't run. After getting it fixed, Drake and Josh aren't allowed to even drive it. Josh gets grounded for lying because of Drake, and Drake takes the dune buggy for a ride regardless. He crashes into a tree and tries to hide his injuries.

Two Idiots And A Baby: 4/5 Josh volunteers to babysit, but Drake abandons the baby to play a concert with his band. Josh soon loses the baby and looks tirelesly around the house for him. Soon, Meghan reveals that she had it the whole time and nobody knows what happened.

[*]First Crush: 4.5/5 Josh promises to play a birthday song on guitar at a girls birthday party. Having no idea how to play it, he has Drake teach him, but the strings on the guitar snap. Drake comes up with a plan that makes Josh look like he's playing it but he really isn't.

Special Features: Outtakes: 5/5 On this DVD there are 8 minutes of outtakes. They are pretty good, too, and are well worth watching. Makes the DVD all more worth the money.

----------

Overall, this is an excellent DVD. The quality for some reason is furry-like on the episodes, but the episodes are still great. It has some of the first episodes of this great series. I really think you should buy it. Since it is from the first season, you will notice some things. First, the whole entire house looks different; especially Drake and Josh's room. The door doesn't even face the same way, and the whole room looks different entirely. You will also notice some ""slip-ups"" by the director, but you'll forgive them. You should really buy this DVD if you are a Drake and Josh fan. It's really just a bummer there are only 4 episodes and there hasn't been a new volume to this for about a year and a half now.
