889105,5,6304479832,"The previous reviewer should realize that this is supposed to be a FUN movie, no one ever said it would be Shakespeare!  Elvis only made fun movies for his fans, more or less portraying the same type of character,  guy meets girl, falls for girl, etc. and also the chance to sing his latest  soundtrack hits.  This is one of Elvis' best films and my favorite of all  his movies.  If I want something heavy with a plot, I will watch the  classics and heavy drama stuff.  This is light entertainment and good,  wholesome fun.",929232000,2,523,4.421052631578948
889106,5,6304479832,This is one of the best feel good movies I have ever seen.  The first time I saw this I couldn't get over Ann-Margret & Elvis' chemistry.  They give each other those looks & it just makes you smile.  It's a fun  movie with great music.,926380800,4,235,4.043478260869565
889265,5,6304479832,"On the 25th anniversay of Elvis' passing, I thought I'd watch one of his films...this is perhaps his best, and in pairing him with Ann-Margret, he met his match. She sizzles in the musical numbers, and sometimes outshines the King when they're on-screen together.
Don't expect a plot or much in the way of dialogue, as everything revolves around the songs. The standouts are the title song, ""Come On, Everybody"", ""What'd I Say"", and ""Appreciation""...but all of them are good, and the other numbers are: ""The Lady Loves Me"", ""I Need Someone to Lean On"", ""Today, Tomorrow, and Forever"", ""My Rival"", and ""If You Think I Don't Need You"".
The choreography by David Winters (who played A-Rab in the ""West Side Story"" film) is quite difficult, and almost awkward, with many direction changes, in Ann-Margret's ""Appreciation"" number (if you watch closely, you'll notice there's a switch to ballet slippers instead of high heels for a short time), but she manages all the dance numbers well, with sparkle and pizazz, and her singing is excellent.
The costume department did a good job, putting Elvis into a lot of very becoming red and black togs, and Ann-Margret's 101 outfits cling to every curve.
The car race footage in the finale is outstanding, and car aficionados will find a lot to like in this film as well as the music.
This was a much appreciated gift, and one I watch when I need some brain candy. Though it's got its flaws, I'm giving it 5 stars for being pure, undiluted entertainment, served up by the Kitten and the King, both in top form, with the glitter and glitz of Las Vegas as their backdrop.",1029456000,47,1605,4.715302491103203
889266,4,6304479832,"Ann-Margret fairly scintillates in this above-average Elvis vehicle, coaxing a winning performance out of the normally wooden Presley, who surely realized his vivacious co-star had the necessary goods to steal the flick, which she very nearly does. Giddy with the success of 1963's ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and a hot commodity at the time, Ann-Margret could sing, dance, emote and effortlessly exude sex appeal, just like Presley. Feeding off chemistry in spades, the pair engages in a good-natured game of ""anything you can do, I can do better"" one-upmanship that is danged entertaining. Particularly amusing is ""The Lady Loves Me,"" a very witty duet with Ann-Margret coquettishly issuing withering snubs to Presley's romantic overtures before shoving him into a swimming pool.
Besides the stars, ""Viva Las Vegas"" has going for it the always reliable Cesare Danova as a suave Italian racing champ and Presley's rival for Ann-Margret's  affections, as well as plenty of Las Vegas eye candy and Grand Prix racing action. And lest I forget, there's the goofily great, pulse-pounding title song. I DARE you to resist singing along!",1022112000,9,1120,5.256983240223463
889267,4,6304479832,"Elvis was always underrated as an actor and he was never given very many opportunities to display his talents and grow. He is most remembered in movieland for all the fluffy films he made, co-starring with some beautiful girl or girls, that had very little plot surrounded by at least half a dozen Elvis tunes.

VIVA LAS VEGAS is such a movie. Elvis plays Lucky, a race car driver who has come to Las Vegas for the Grand Prix. However, his car needs a new engine and he loses all his cash. So, to earn some dough he starts working at the hotel he's staying at as a waiter. In the process, he meets a beautiful hotel swimming instructor named Rusty (Ann-Margret) and the two our swept up in a speedy courtship.

Now, with that said, VIVA LAS VEGAS, like many of Elvis films, is entertaining. They are the equivalent to the special effects mind candy movies that are made today. Besides seeing The King in his prime there are four other reasons for watching VIVA LAS VEGAS: 1. Ann-Margret 2. Ann-Margret 3. The car race near the end of the film and 4. Ann-Margret. I know that lady was way before my time, but she could dance better than most other actresses I've ever seen and she was hot. The chemistry between her and Elvis is the best of any other Elvis pairing. They made quite a pair and it would have been interesting to see the two stars in more than one movie",1013558400,,1366,4.352941176470588
889268,5,6304479832,"Thanks to Ann-Margret's involvement, ""Viva Las Vegas"" ranks as one of my favorite musicals...and my favorite of all of Elvis' movies. The songs are just great (check out ""C'mon Everybody""), and the Vegas setting is just splendid!
I must have seen this film at least 30 times and still get a big kick out of it!!!",1005955200,,312,4.589285714285714
889269,5,6304479832,"The very best Elvis Presley movie I have ever seen!!!! Ann-Margret scorches the film in the song ""The Lady Loves Me"" with Elvis.  The undeniable chemistry only adds to the pleasure of this movie.  It has a cute story line and co-stars who are actually in love.  Amazing and keeps you dancing with an excellent soundtrack.",988502400,2,321,4.696428571428571
889270,5,6304479832,"Lucky Jackson (Elvis Presley) is a race car driver. He is on his way to L.A. to pick up a motor. The movie opens, when we meet Lucky Jackson in a hotel casino.
He meets Count Elmo Mancini (Cesare Danova) another race driver who races mostly in Europe. Who decides to race in the United States for the first time. While looking under Elmo Mancini's race car and young woman comes up to them, thinking he repaires cars.
In L.A. his car repair names Shorty (Nicky Blair) is waiting for him but leaves when a customer tries to buy the motor. And heads for Las Vegas. Elmo fixes the young woman car. And instead of going to L.A. Elmo and Lucky go on a long search for her.
Thier search gets them to the Lone Star State or Texas. Back at the hotel he finds her and finds out she is the swimming teacher. Her name is Rusty Martin (Ann-Margret). Rusty pushes Lucky off the hotel diving board and into the hotel pool.
Lucky loses the motor money and he owes the hotel money too and he and Shorty take waiter jobs at the hotel. When Elmo Mancini sees Lucky as a waiter he says, ""What's this some kind of American joke?"" And soon he gets tired of Lucky Jackson as a waiter and pays of thier debt.",988329600,,1185,4.201754385964913
889271,5,6304479832,"Even if this film doesn't float your boat(and actually this is a pun  because William Demerests character has a boat)...just do yourself a  favor>>> sit through the first twenty minutes , a pretty cute  musical theatre piece with Elvis and Cesere Danova pursuing a swim  instructor, the subsequent meeting of Elvis and said instructorand another  fun number with some actual great lyrics, the odd comic loss of Elvis's  money(what little kid would find money and put it in a pool drain) and then  get transported to UNLV where Elvis and Ann-Margaret do a little  improvisational number, which is called Cmon Everybody.  Elvis doesn't do  it for you?  Never really gotten Ann Margaret?  These four minutes will  solidify them in your mind as one of the coolest hot couples in the movies.  This number is so hot you will want to see it twice, or three times.  there is cool stuff, including the title track and Rusty(Ann-Margaret)  crooning a Cole Porteresque number about sugar daddies. And a sort of  anticlimactic sports car race... But Cmon Everybody take a real deep  breath.... See this time capsule to a simpler Vegas in a simpler time. And  rock with the king and queen of cool",968112000,2,1183,4.796019900497512
889272,4,6304479832,"This movie seems a cut above the usual Presley picture, largely thanks to  the energizing presence of Ann Margret. With her snazzy dancing, big  numbers, and decent songs, Elvis seems to enjoy this one a bit. The plot is  silly enough, but the whole thing is a fascinating time capsule. It even  opens cinematically well with a long pan over the Las Vagas strip. The  film's ending does seem extremely abrupt, as if they suddenly ran out of  money or something, but it hardly matters in this live-for-the-moment  funfest.",960336000,3,521,4.786516853932584
889273,4,6304479832,"I can't say that I'm a fan of either Elvis Presley or musicals and bought this video only as an experiment in watching something 180 degrees from my norm. Having said that-and standard Hollywood boy gets girl/loses/gets  again simplicity aside-this film rocks! A technicolor kitsch fest with  so-bad-it's-good Vegas cheese costumes and sets, this is a truly compelling  time capsule...and it has THAT song. ""What'd I Say?"" is one of  the most entertaining, hi-energy, goofy/silly, exuberant, infectious, fun  dance numbers ever filmed (you have to play it again and again to get all  the detail). A lot of what shows on MTV and VH1 is such a bore by  comparison. The ""Viva Las Vegas"" number and the car race are  great too.",948758400,18,723,4.868852459016393

7872872,5,6304479832,"This is essentially a movie about two of the screen's most famous duos who never made another film due to Col. Parker's dislike of Ann-Margret and of the director having a very badly concealed crush on the actress. That said, this is one of Elvis' best films with production values more deserving of his talents. The songs are great and Ann-Margret practically steals the film. Whatta body! She just sizzles and burns her way into your memory!",1131580800,9,443,4.766233766233766
7872873,3,6304479832,"I'd give it a higher rating if this movie wasn't entirely missing something some people would consider important, namely a plot.  It's the usual Elvis-meets-girl, Elvis-sings-to-girl, Elvis-gets-girl flick, and with that, there's nothing new under the sun.  But above any other Elvis musical, this one defines Elvis the movie star.  If plot is not important, than this one is the cinematic definition of Elvis the movie start.
What makes it click is the fiery chemistry between Elvis and Ann Margaret.  Not the acting, mind you.  Remember, this is not a plot movie.  It's each one taking turns doing what they do best.  With Elvis, of course, it's singing and swiveling, and this film has a decent collection of songs, topped by, of course, with the immortal title number.
When it comes to the lady, though, Ann Margaret matches him stride for stride.  She starts off mild with a cute duet which ends up with her gently pushing him off a high dive into a hotel pool, but heats up from there.  When they meet at the local university, she demonstrates some dance moves that sizzle up the screen.  This gets followed up with each doing their respective contributions in a talent show, and based on each one's performance, I'm not sure the final winner was correct.
Finally, you get these priceless shots of Las Vegas from a bygone era.  You see downtown before the Fremont Street canopy.  In fact, there don't seem to be any exterior shots of any of the Strip hotels, which really puts it in a time capsule.  Throw in some shots of the Hoover Dam and Mount Charleston, and you've got a movie that can work as a tourist film, and probably came out a higher quality product than the Elvis-factory movie makers thought possible.",1043971200,5,1722,4.719063545150502
7872874,5,6304479832,"""Viva Las Vegas"" wins hands down as Elvis' best '60s musical comedy. Elvis singing the title tune which is my favorite sequence in the picture along with ""I Need Somebody To Lean On"", ""If You Think I Don't Need You"" and more. Ann-Margret is so good-looking in this picture. She and Elvis should have made more pictures together and sooner, too. A treat for every Elvis fan everywhere and great addition to one's Elvis movie library!",1035590400,2,432,4.697368421052632
7872875,4,6304479832,"I used to not be a big fan of Elvis movies. For all of his talent with a song, his films (with a few exceptions) were basically all the same formula: a crooning playboy situated in (exotic location of your choice), with any number of young, excited women waiting in the wings. But in ""VLV"" he has a more independent-than-usual female co-star (the stunningly beautiful Ann-Margret), who not only matches him in sex appeal, but who forces him to fight for her affection. It's a wonderful match of wits, from the first number, ""The Lady Loves Me."" They are both marvelous as they each musically bait the other, right up until he takes a header into a swimming pool. (In subsequent scenes they water ski, have a western-style showdown, tour Vegas in a helicopter, and dance in a gymnasium.) Later, when they both compete in the same talent show, A-M gives Elvis a run for his money with her hotter-than-hot striptease ""Appreciation."" It's perfect that the final shot in the movie is a split-screen of the title song sung (by him) and danced (by her). If no one knew that they were having a romance in real life; they'd figure it out from the chemistry generated in this film. This one and ""G.I. Blues"" (which features another independent co-star) are my favorites.",1029715200,2,1260,4.68018018018018
