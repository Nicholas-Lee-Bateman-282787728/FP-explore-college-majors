7908213,5,B00000FDVL,"Spider! is a thirteen part series of charming, unforgettable musical tales about a boy and a spider, that first aired on CBBC in 1991.
When the little boy first meets the spider in the bath, he's disgusted. By the end of the series they are true friends. Some of the stories are thoughtful, some are plain silly, but all are funny and beautifully portrayed.",1030060800,2,357,4.59375
7908214,3,B00000FDVL,"This is a cute video.  It's a collection of songs, loosely related, that together tell the story of how a boy who first thinks that a spider is gross, comes to be his friend.  The songs are sung by a male vocalist and accompanied rather nicely on guitar.  None are really memorable, but all are pleasant and rather playful.  I thought my four year old might get bored with the video, but he watched it from beginning to end (it's about an hour long)--and, while it's not his favorite, he occasionally asks for it.  I suspect kids who are much older (say 7 or up), might tire of it more easily.  At any rate, this is a nice alternative for parents looking for a break from the usual frantic super-hero stuff.",975283200,5,707,4.358778625954199
