8359974,5,B002AP5WZG,"I approach most topics on the future with a great deal of skepticism. Futurism tends to make science-fiction out of science, which isn't a bad thing as long as Futurists own up to their anecdotalism. But that's not what happens. Science becomes just a little too sensational and every miracle is always only ""10 years away."" Clones, a documentary on the once controversial topic of cloning, was produced nearly nine years ago, and so far all we've had are hams and hoaxes.

Thankfully, Peter Williams the Director of Clones avoided the sensationalist trap and adopted a surprisingly sobering perspective of one of cloning's most notorious figures: Dr. Zavos. For those who don't know or simply don't care, Dr. Zavos has a thriving IVF practice and decided that the next most profitable move for infertile couples was to offer the service of human cloning. He made plenty of tall promises about engineering the first clone and was rewarded with a fair number of respondents looking to be his first subject. The documentary interviews a number of these respondents and the emotional nature of one interview confirms that some couples want a clone, not for the fame or attention, but simply to have a child with the genes of one of the parents. These anonymous faces help to balance the scale of the others who see cloning as a medical novelty and an opportunity to make history, or, at the very least, make the news.

Dr. Zavos seems to exist somewhere between these two worlds. He has a tremendous poker face and often gives the impression that he sincerely wants to use the infamous technology to help couples, who have exhausted all other possibilities, produce a child. However, his detractors see a man with an eye on fame and is willing to cross questionable lines to get it. Peter Williams takes the role of an objective eye on the topic of cloning and the dubious antics of Dr. Zavos. The highlight of this film comes while watching the successful implantation of a donated egg with a human cell. Sans-sperm, the egg is jumpstarted by a few seconds of electricity and actually undergoes mitosis.

Nine years later, the topic of cloning has died down but has not entirely gone away. In fact, it will very likely start to heat up again within the next four years under the Obama administration. When it does, this will be a good documentary to take off the shelves, blow the dust off and see what lessons we didn't learn from the days of Dr. Zavos.",1251072000,,2452,4.724299065420561
