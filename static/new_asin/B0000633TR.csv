8135949,5,B0000633TR,"This is the second movie from Francisco Athie that I have watched. I didn't do it because it was from him (FIBRA OPTICA), but for the great cast he has in it.

1 Lucha Villa as the middle-low class mother, struggling to keep her kids afloat
2 Alicia Montoya as the greedy loan lady in the neighborhood
3 Damin Alczar as the corrupt policeman, related to Lolo
4 Roberto Sosa as Lolo, whose love to his mother made him make a mistake

Roberto Sosa, with an appearance like his, ends always in this kind of movies. This one is a very interesting one, because portrays almost like a mirror, the lives and troubles of the less fortunate. Victims of circumstances. It's not an excuse, hunger and lack of opportunities is not a good combination... make people do crazy stuff...",1316736000,,770,4.532374100719425

He accidentally kills the local money-lender when trying to steal back his mother's gold watch that she had pawned the day before. After this, Lola is on the run, hunted down by every one in the neighborhood, the police and a local gang. Shot in fast-paced action style with dialogue in a particular Mexico City slang.
