Just like you wouldn't buy clothes you knew were made by child slaves, you won't want to buy these videos knowing that the people who made them are well known pedophiles. And ultimately the people most befitting from the sale of them are the Cult leaders themselves.

7900349,1,1563645467,"Created by members of the family international/children of god/the family of love...a  pseudo christian cult with a background in child abuse, religious prostitution and much more you would never want to expose your children to in any form. It might seem innocent by where it comes from and who it supports make it a bad purchase. There are many better series without links to evil cults like this.

7900350,1,1563645467,"These products are made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerby's pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known: River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Buhring (Guiness world record holder as the first woman to circumnavigate the work on a bicycle), Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent.
I recommend that you do not buy this product.",1456704000,,775,4.871212121212121

7900352,4,1563645467,This toddler video is even useful for adults whom never learned the simple lesson. This show puts those veggies to shame! Hands down the best christian toddler learning video. I am taking off one star for the improper portrayal of angels.,1396051200,,238,4.829268292682927
7900353,5,1563645467,"When I first saw this show on TV I thought it was really strange. However, as I watched it, I realized how amazing it is in its ability to reach a very wide age span with truths about Jesus and life and who God is. These are really GREAT videos. My husband and I, our 9Yr old (into legos and action and Wii) boy, our 2 and 3 yr old grandsons and their mother all love these. I'd love to see them become very popular and stay in print.",1357776000,,434,3.8876404494382024

In a day when its difficult to find good audio/visual material for children, this series is a wonderful breath of fresh air.

Not only do they teach important values, but they also contain the innocence and good faith that is often lacking in contemporary television.  My grandchild can't wait to watch them, and watches them over and over. Hats off to the producers!",1097712000,,288,4.857142857142857
7900356,3,1563645467,"as i watched the videos....i was moved by the way the topics were handled....brilliant! reminds me of the work of david berg, a man obviously ahead of his time! all i can say is that if it would interest you for your child to spend an afternoon in the capable hands of david berg,karen zerby, and steven kelly (a trio of childcare experts), then this video is for you...
watch it with your child.....fun for The entire Family!!!!!",1047513600,5,430,4.5256410256410255
