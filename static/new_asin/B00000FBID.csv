7908060,5,B00000FBID,"This VHS is everything I hoped it would be...a fantastic summary of the history, and an application of Darwins theories at their best. The animal life is phenomenal.",1440547200,,165,4.928571428571429
7908061,2,B00000FBID,"I knew I was buying a used video, but the quality was listed as good. About a quarter of the way through the movie, there was a fuzzy band that moved across the screen blurring the screen and the audio about once every minute. I am a teacher and can no longer get this video from my local library so I decided to buy it. There was not time to send it back after I previewed it the night before I used it and get a new one. I had to use it and it was very distracting to my students, and almost not worth showing it. I am very dissapointed; this video was in no way in good condition.",1333152000,,583,3.8666666666666667
7908062,5,B00000FBID,"I have been using this video in my high school biology class for years.  It very light heartedly introduces students to some of unique critters Galapagos has to offer.  While it obviously does not cover all of them, it does a great job introducing the uniqueness of those within the video.  Richard Dreyfuss brings a perfect sense of humor to the situation.  While there are much more science rich documentaries out there about the Galapagos, for the student's to see just how interesting an actor can find nature is a natural hook.",1203292800,2,532,4.75
7908063,1,B00000FBID,"Richard Dreyfuss' personality is more apparent than any wild critters you might wish to see from these islands.  I am doing some research and was looking to see some of the animals from these islands in action -- I was quite dismayed that there were no blue-footed booby birds!  There were some nice shots of some Galapagos tortoises, though.  R.D. spends too much time talking for the sake of talking than to actually say anything worthwhile. I also cannot recommend this for viewing by children as R.D also makes too many references to the animals having sex and joking about a lack of cigarettes on the ground to prove it.",983750400,,625,4.663636363636364
7908064,2,B00000FBID,"Having just returned from the Galapagos aboard the M/Y Letty where I watched this video, it pales by comparison to those nature documentaries by David Attenborough.  This in not for the serious naturalist.  Richard  Dreyfuss seems more interested in using the fauna as a ""straight  man"" for his attempted comedic remarks.  Almost zero time spent on the  fishes of Galapagos, except for a very brief view of a scalloped hammerhead  shark -- to which R.D. responds that he's getting out of the water.  This  provides a false impression of these graceful sharks with which I and many  others were snorkeling among. R.D. could have focused on the benign  attitude of the hammerhead and white-tips in the Galapagos, and how  remarkable it is that multitudes of snorkelers and divers have been in very  close (I was within 15 feet of a hammerhead) to these creatures without  harm.  I was largely disappointed with this video, and the only reason  that I am purchasing it is that our guide extrordinaire, Greg Estes, is in  it and is never even given any type of mention or credit.",953078400,8,1075,4.786885245901639
