8133456,5,B000GNOH7I,This was so interesting and informative about some of the main sculptures at the Louvre. I can hardly wait to see them myself some day. Thank you for expediting the order.,1404000000,,171,4.548387096774194
8133457,5,B000GNOH7I,"I rented this dvd from the library and was so blown away by the beauty of the presentation of these artworks that I went and bought it for myself. I am going to show it to all my friends who love art like I do this summer. The commentary is so well done that it makes me feel like I am on a private tour of the Louvre seeing these statues for the first time. The photography of these works of art, is superb. It will be a little slow for those who don't know to drink in art to ones very soul. I wish this was a series of movies for so many artworks that I have studied all my life. This is one of my best purchases in my life.",1340582400,3,627,3.757575757575758

8133459,5,B000GNOH7I,"This program of superbly-produced half-hour documentaries covers seven of the most important sculptures in the world, all from the Louvre Museum in Paris.  No talking heads, but instead excellent coverage of each sculpture's history, creation, style and importance.  Recommended for casual art fans as well as classrooms.",1210118400,4,321,5.808510638297872
8133460,4,B000GNOH7I,"Some say that Americans and French have had tensions since the start of the Iraq War.  (Think ""freedom fries,"" people!)  Some American viewers may worry that this work revolves around the French patting themselves on the back for what they possess in their most famous museum.  It does not.  It speaks of a piece, how it was found, and the history/anthropology/cultural significance of it.

This work has 7 segments.  So I think one school could use it for multiple purposes.  The art teacher can show the Michelangelo segment when teaching about Renaissance art.  At Christian schools, they can show the Mary Magdelene segment to students.  The Ramses segment will be good when Ancient Egypt comes up in whichever class.

This work showed no academic interviewees.  Instead, just the narrator speaks while still and moving images are shown.  I stand by what I said in the first paragraph, but I also must admit that this made me want to visit the Louvre.",1193529600,4,955,4.863354037267081
