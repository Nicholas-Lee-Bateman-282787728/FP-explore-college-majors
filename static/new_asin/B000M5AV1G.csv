8166401,4,B000M5AV1G,"I saw a Impressions Sanjie Liu performance when visited Gulin in 2009.  I have the DVD CD package that was sold after the performance and was hoping to get something with better quality. I will admit that this performance is very difficult to record, the lighting and overall size of the production makes it almost impossible to get professional results. I think one of the best parts of the program is the opening where the girl is singing in a boat that is moving toward the audience, the spotlight follows the boat while the girl is singing. Thank you for trying, there is nothing better than seeing it in person.",1457395200,,616,4.6
8166402,2,B000M5AV1G,"To see Impression Sanjie Liu performed live is a spectacular experience as jaw-droppingly beautiful as anything one would see on a tour of China. Its remote site near Guilin is far from the better known attractions in or near the great cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Furthermore the site is integral to the performance making it impossible to take the show ""on the road."" For all these reasons I hoped for a video version of the performance as a memento as well as to share with friends and family who would never travel to see it. The first impression is positive seeing a colorful, well-designed box containing the dvd and two music cds.  The second impression, the dvd, disappoints. In short this is a condensed version of the show. Rather like an elaborate movie trailer, this production only teases the viewer with partial segments of the various acts or ""impressions"" labeled by the colors red, blue, gold, green and silver. Added material purports to show behind the scenes activities (The Creation Course) in the manner of a ""making of"" version of the performance. I contacted the producers to ask if a more complete version was available and was told that only the condensed version was made in order to maintain the attraction of the live performance. This makes sense in the same way that Broadway producers don't make videos of shows in production. Still the logic is lacking for the reasons I stated above: This is not a show that can be ""taken on the road"" and it is not located in place to where most tourists will travel. Perhaps they fear that pirated versions will leak back to China and undercut their primary audience, the billion or so Chinese locals. On balance this is not a bad purchace so long as you know what you're getting: a condensed version of a live spectacular.  It is much less costly than travel to China.",1325894400,2,1852,4.695384615384615
8166403,2,B000M5AV1G,"I bought this DVD because I saw such nice reviews from many people who saw the show in China. I was disappointed that the whole DVD contains only about 46 minutes of movie and only half of the time is about the actual show. The rest of the time is about the scenery of the area with songs sung in the show. If one wants to have a glimpse of the show, he or she will be disappointed like me. The only way to go is to see the show in person in China.",1216857600,,448,3.776595744680851
8166404,5,B000M5AV1G,I saw this show in China in Oct. 2007 and wanted to get a DVD background of the show.  This DVD reflects well on how the show was put together.  It gave me a better explanation of how the show was able to give such unique effects. The 2 CDs includes the beautiful music of the minority groups.  Good package to get to give you a good insight into the show about the minorities in China.,1196985600,3,386,4.052631578947368
