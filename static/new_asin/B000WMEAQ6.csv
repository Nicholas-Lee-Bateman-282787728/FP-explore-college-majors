8224272,5,B000WMEAQ6,"Talk about man's inhumanity to man or should I say man's inhumanity to a boy. Vadim was sent out for a loaf of bread and as boys do when they see a crowd gathering, they become curious and want to check it out. This proved to be Vadim's wrongdoing.  Like most of those in the crowd, they were snatched up by the police and sent off to prison without a trial or a hearing or anything. What made this even worse was Vadim, a boy, was sent to a man's prison rather than a juvenile detention facility..

While there in prison, Vadim very quickly learned the harshness to one's life. Although he got along rather well with those he was celled with; the guards, however, was a different story. It just goes to show how much one can do when he is in authority. One guard actually wanted Vadim to sign a document saying he is a member of some radical youth organization, but Vadim fortunately saw the fine print and refused to sign. Needless to say the guard was not that pleased and it took Vadim some days to recover from that experience.

Eventually Vadim was freed and now he must face another problem, reconciling with his mother whom he thought abandoned him  while he was in prison. Not only was this a great film but also a film on survival and although a boy, Vadim didn't take long to accomplish this..",1395532800,,1304,4.3539094650205765

A distinction has to be made with the general public that being Russian doesn't necessarily make you a Soviet. Being a Soviet really does tend to turn a human being into something other. The brutality of these ideologues is mind numbing. They are totally detached from the people they punish. In this film, like other Russian films, the victims seem to be able to endure for awhile. Eventually though the human mind and body collapse into themselves and madness ensues. These people were criminals 'of the state' not criminals in the moral sense. The real criminals in this film held the keys. If we pay no heed to history we are doomed as a civilization. We cannot have these horrors revisited on our brothers and sisters.",1217030400,6,858,4.797297297297297
8224274,5,B000WMEAQ6,"This is an outstanding portrayal of a period of history during the pre-perestroika period of the Soviet era. It portrays life in the Soviet Union that we never got to see. It gives us a perspective on the events that happened during the final months of the Khrushchev regime in the Soviet Union.
It tells the story of an innocent youth that was in the wrong place at the wrong time when a riot occurred. The police rounded them all up and placed them in prison. What follows after that is humilating shower room experiences, unsanitary facilities, a tomblike prison cell, and no contact with the outside world. The fellow captives are preyed on, tortured, die, or quietly lose their minds.
Only Russian filmmakers can make these kind of films. 'Greenhouse Effect' is another excellent Russian film to watch. They both give an excellent view of life in the U.S.S.R.",1206316800,13,864,4.766666666666667
