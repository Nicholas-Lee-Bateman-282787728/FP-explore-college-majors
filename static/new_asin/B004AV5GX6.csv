4311481,5,B004AV5GX6,"Just saw this movie last week, and it was much better than any preview could show.  I feared it might revolve around 90 minutes at a dinner with odd humor and wierd people. But the dinner itself was a background to the actual story which was much better.  Let just say that we find out who the real schmucks are, and Steve Carell is not the schmuck.  I recommend seeing it in the theater, but a must rent and a great buy for continued laughs.",1281916800,7,442,4.176470588235294
4311482,1,B004AV5GX6,"Boring movie, I can't believe this is supposed to be a comedy. I found it boring and tedious. I guess it might be funny to a small child as Carell acts like a child. What a waste, couldn't even finish it. I didn't even crack a smile, much less laugh at all. I miss the good old days when movies were good.",1281744000,6,305,3.935483870967742
4311483,4,B004AV5GX6,"I saw Dinner for Schmucks in a totally empty theater populated only by me and my youngest.  This is a good thing since I found myself in convulsive laughter as close to actually rolling on the floor laughter as I've seen in years.

As suggested by the title a person looking to climb in a company impresses the boss who invites him to a special ""dinner"" where each person brings an idiot and the winner is the one who produces the biggest loser.

The writing on this story is superb, Steve Carell is spectacular, the supporting cast is unbelievability and uniformly excellent and Paul Rudd is a perfect foil and straight man to the entire ensemble, completely overwhelmed by a series of events.

If there is a criticism it is that it takes much too long to get to the actual dinner.  I think the picture should have been a least 5 minutes shorter but what I can see how hard it would be cut particular scenes, in fact at some points there are signs that the movie was trimmed abruptly to solve that very problem.

A second critique might be within 15 minutes you know exactly how it will end, but the trip from that point is so much fun that you don't care.

This movie needs to be seen on the big screen, so find a second run movie house if you can, if not the DVD will be worth getting, just don't drink while you are watching it.",1281744000,10,1332,4.282868525896414
4311484,2,B004AV5GX6,"Ok, my mom and I went to see this moive a few days ago.  She didn;t think it was funny at all.  I did laugh at parts.  I couldn't stop laughing actually.  But, I did not laugh as much as I thought I would.  This is a dryer kind of humor than I thought it would be.  It's about a man who wants to go up to a bigger part at his job.  He finds out his boss has a party in which the men who go compete to see who can bring the bigger idiot.  He meets carells character.  That is the entire movie.  I honestly can not remember anything about the movie, other than the fact that I laughed a few times.  Some movies are great to see first in the theaters.  Like Harry Potter or Star Wars.  Others should be left to see at home.  This is one of those movies.  It just wasn't that good.  No part of it was memorable nor did it make me feel as if I had spent my money wisely.",1281225600,3,865,3.7486033519553073
4311485,4,B004AV5GX6,"Tim (Paul Rudd) wants a raise at his job to impress his girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak) so she finally agrees to marry him. When Tim impresses his boss with a presentation, he thinks he got the job; but it turns out that first he has to find someone for him and his co-workers to make fun of at a dinner for idiots.

  Since Julie thinks the idea is cruel, Tim decides not to do it, until he meets Barry (Steve Carell) who dresses dead mice up like historical figures. Tim invites Barry to the dinner, but Barry shows up at Tim's apartment a day early, swearing that it's the right day and that Tim must be the one wrong. Which leads to Barry making Tim's life a living hell pretty much just in one evening. Barry might turn Tim's life upside down, but the whole time he's doing it, he means well at least.

  Dinner for Schmucks is often very funny and smart. Paul Rudd is once again playing it straight and he once again is playing a guy with a g/f who wants her to marry him. Looking back at the film, I can't think of any scene where he made me laugh. He does bring some charm to the film at least though. Carrell, Jemaine Clement and Zach Galifianakis easily steal the show. I have never seen Clement before, but he's hilarious as Julie's artist/model boss who wants to steal her from Tim. While Galifianakis is a doofus who thinks he can control people's minds.",1281139200,4,1372,4.319066147859922
4311486,2,B004AV5GX6,"I'm missing something here. I understand that the real schmucks of ""Dinner for Schmucks"" are played by Bruce Greenwood, Larry Wilmore, and Ron Livingston, not Paul Rudd and Steve Carell, and that means I should be able to see how certain characters and plot elements are ultimately redeemed. So then why do I still feel that this movie is ugly, spiteful, and profoundly unfunny? How is it that I cannot bring myself to feel anything for the characters I'm supposed to have feelings for? What is the one element that makes such unpleasantness okay to sit through? What am I failing to see? Many have been praising ""Dinner for Schmucks"" for its slapstick comedy and its representation of character, but to me, it's a deep mystery, raising the question of how anyone could ever find it entertaining.

Perhaps it all has to do with the underlying premise, which is so mean-spirited that no amount of broad humor could make me look past it. In the film, a group of high powered executives, all arrogant, hold an annual dinner party in which they showcase the dumbest people they can find, people who all claim to have special talents and seem to enjoy flaunting them. To me, this isn't comedy, but rather a study in human cruelty. It doesn't matter that the joke is on the executives and not on the guests; the fact that they're all too stupid to realize how badly they're being treated only makes the movie's idea that much more depressing. Why? Because, even after the dinner is over, they will continue to live in a state of hopeless ignorance. This is no way to live. This is just plain sad.

Such a person is IRS employee Barry Speck (Carell), who always displays big toothy grins and seems to enjoy laughing a lot. He literally doesn't have a clue. He does things without really thinking them through first. He makes the lives of those around him a living hell, although he believes he's actually helping them, which I guess is to be expected since this is a comedy of errors. I suspect I was supposed to like this character, especially at the end of the film. That's the problem - I didn't like him one bit. His ignorance was annoying. His sweet natured clumsiness was infuriating. And then there's his ""talent,"" which is collecting dead mice, having them stuffed and dressed in various tiny costumes, and then posing them in highly detailed dioramas and model scenes. I'm sorry, but I find this incredibly disturbing.

The plot, which is adapted from the French film ""Le Dner de Cons"" (itself adapted from a play), begins with Tim Conrad (Rudd), a financial executive clawing his way up the corporate ladder, his latest negotiation with a wealthy Swiss businessman (David Walliams) having gone well. Impressed, Tim's boss, Lance Fender (Greenwood), invites him to take part in the aforementioned dinner. Lo and behold, he literally rams into Barry, who then clings to Tim like a dog who has just found a new best friend. Over the course of a day, a night, and a brunch, Barry systematically ruins Tim's life. He mistakenly reintroduces him to an ex-girlfriend (Lucy Punch), a stalker so frightening it's a wonder Tim never tried filing a restraining order. This, in turn, jeopardizes his relationship with his current girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), who is never ready to say yes when he proposes to her.

Despite the title, the dinner isn't seen until the very end, at which point the plot's unflinching cruelty left me mentally drained. This is bad because the dinner is one of relentless absurdity - everything and everyone involved is so unbelievably silly that I just couldn't process it anymore. Over the course of this scene, we see a ventriloquist that thinks his dummy is his wife, a blind swordsman, a dead animal medium (who reacts grotesquely to her lobster dinner), and Barry's boss (Zach Galifinakis), a man who believes he has the ability to control people's minds; with such a large gathering of odd, goofy people, the scene becomes a chaotic free-for-all, one that very quickly becomes unappealing and unfunny.

Knowing that Fender and his cronies are heartless, knowing that the invited idiots are too idiotic to understand that they're idiots, and knowing that Tim went along with it all for the sake of getting ahead in business, I simply cannot bring myself to say anything nice about ""Dinner for Schmucks."" Why is this? The ending is one of sweet - albeit twisted - redemption, which means I should be able to look past everything that made my skin crawl. But some movies are just too nasty for their own good, and no amount of last-minute hopefulness can gloss over that. It's a story about mean people doing mean things, and as far as I'm concerned, that doesn't qualify as entertainment. I felt sad leaving the theater, and I secretly hoped that the filmmakers would someday understand just how wrong their efforts were.",1280880000,6,4855,4.788782816229117
4311487,4,B004AV5GX6,"If only modestly skilled performers had been cast in DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS, the film would have been a mess...tonally inconsistent, with a sloppy plot and a final 15 minutes of pure ludicrousness (is that a word?)

Fortunately, the film stars Steve Carrell & Paul Rudd...two of the funniest guys around who also both happen to be extremely adept at giving their outrageous or obnoxious characters real emotional depth.

Paul Rudd plays a mid-level analyst in some firm that specializes in taking over troubled firms and selling off their assets.  He concocts a great money-making idea and is tentatively welcomed ""upstairs"" to where the offices are much nicer and the salaries much bigger.  But to be fully embraced in the club of executives, he must attend a dinner hosted by his boss (Bruce Greenwood).  At this dinner, each guest is asked to bring along someone ""extraordinary""...a person who can be mocked as an idiot.  Preferably somebody self-deluded about his abilities or simply incredibly dim-witted.

Rudd is horrified, as is his girlfriend, an art gallery owner who ostensibly has no interest in big business, money, the trappings of a rich lifestyle, etc.  But when he accidentally runs his car into Steve Carrell, it is as though fate is handing him the perfect dinner guest.  Carrell is an IRS agent who has failed to recover from his wife ditching him for his boss, and who is sublimating all this grief into the creation of large, incredibly detailed miniature ""scenes"" (think The Last Supper or Benjamin Franklin flying his kite) wherein dead mice in costumes are the people.  Carrell has amazing creative and taxidermy skills...but he's also nave, clueless, clumsy and a clinger.  Rudd invites him to the dinner, but when Carrell misunderstands the date and time, the two men end up together for a very long, frantic and disastrous day.

Most of the movie does NOT involve the titular DINNER...which is probably a good thing.  When the dinner does begin, I would say it is among the more sloppy moments of the film.  The idiots who are introduced and paraded in front of us are wildly unconvincing as real people, not terribly funny and the scene is allowed to devolve into frantic running around, with plates breaking and fires blazing.  It's like the climactic scene to a farce...except that farces have to be carefully constructed from the beginning in order for the chaos to actually be a payoff.  DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS starts us down that road, but then takes an hour long diversion as Rudd & Carrell have their own adventures.

Carrell & Rudd are so charming and skilled at playing off each other that the vast majority of the film is simply hilarious.  It should NOT work as well as it does...the scenes are often contrived and no one behaves terribly logically, even within the confines of the film.  But the fact is, I laughed my rear-end off...and that's almost good enough for me.  Carrell gives his idiot a real heart and real pain...he is simultaneously touching and aggravating.  No one can do this as well as Carrell at the moment.  Rudd is his handsome, cynical self.  His character teeters between giving in to his greedy, ""corporate"" side and feeling bad that he's even thinking of improving his lot in life by tearing down others.  No one is better than Rudd at walking this line, so we are able to both root for him and feel disappointed in him at the same time.  Carrell & Rudd have worked together before...and their ease together shows.  What I like about both these actors is that they both are comfortable sharing the laughs and limelight with others.  I don't want to stretch this too far, but have you ever noticed that particular smile of delight that hits Carrell's face when someone else does something funny?  They come in little bursts where we see a big smile and see his eyes twinkle with surprise and admiration.  This allows the viewer to see the human underneath the outlandish character.  Both Carrell and Rudd believe in NOT pushing the comedy...because none of the things happening are supposed to be funny to the character...just the audience.

Zach Galifinakis turns up in a strange role as Carrell's boss.  He's only in a few scenes, but he steals them.  Rudd & Carrell LET him steal the scenes...but there is one moment when Galifinakis is laughing at some notion Rudd has articulated, and his clenched laughter and his ever reddening face were absolutely priceless.  The whole audience completely lost it during that 30 second masterpiece.

I was very pleased to see FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS member Jemaine Clement playing a truly obnoxious artist.  His role is gloriously over-the-top, and thus many will not like it, but I actually found him more grounded than this clich&eacute;d part is usually played.  Normally the typical artist is portrayed as simply strutting around, preening and caring only about himself.  Clement does that, but we also see that he genuinely is able to connect with others, even if it IS in an odd way.  And he gets to wear the BEST minotaur costume ever!

The women in the film are given extremely short shrift.  Rudd's girlfriend is as bland as bland can be...and we're also asked to believe that she hates the trappings of corporate America, yet his perfectly okay with living in the most amazing apartment building in a deeply expensive apartment.  This makes her shallow, and thus her protestations to Rudd feel hollow.  Other women are just emasculating weirdoes.

Finally, the film wants to have things two ways.  On one hand, it wants to be something of a dark comedy, because the idea of a dinner for idiots is uncomfortable and squirm-inducing.  But it also wants to be a sweeter, off-kilter bromance.  The two do NOT combine very smoothly...and thus the tone of the film bounces around more than I would like.

So the film has its ups and downs.  But my enjoyment of the two leads and my laughter levels make this a strong recommendation from me.  No Oscar awards await this film...but it was the funniest film I've seen in several months, if not all year.",1280707200,4,6054,4.813165537270087
4311488,4,B004AV5GX6,"This is a dark, dark, dirty, dirty, awkward comedy that's surprisingly sweet, but above all, a very funny crowd-pleasing film that you should feel horrible for laughing at/with.

Most of the funny comes courtesy of Steve Carell, where it becomes clear to me that he's one of the greatest comedy actors of the past 20 years. Carell simply elevates every scene he's in, making stupid jokes funny and gives you the go-ahead to laugh about terrible things. Cast anybody else in that role, and the film is a mean-spirited and unfunny dud. Take for example the final dinner scene. Carell delivers the Dreamers speech perfectly, and then when Zach Galifianakis gets up and does his thing, which is terrible, mean-spirited and downright sad, you laugh and feel for the character because of the energy and love Carell injects into the role. In fact, his whole character in general is kind of depressing. He makes the Mouseterpieces to express himself. I mean, there's a scene where Paul Rudd is going through a few of Carell's Mouseterpieces, and it's portraits of that character's troubled marriage and his wife breaking up with him. It's presented in a silly way, but not only does the film make it emotional, but Carell makes it work with the character. It takes real talent, and pretty decent writing/direction to do that, and Dinner for Idiots does it well.

Not to say the rest of the movie is bad, it's just kind of underwhelming for most of it. Paul Rudd does what Paul Rudd does, and his relationship story simply isn't interesting without Jermaine Clement or Steve Carell to spice it up, until the end. Oh, and then there's that dirty, dirty stalker. Terrible and easy jokes are made with that, but they're still pretty dang funny. During Inception, my head hurt because I was thinking too much. During Dinner for Idiots, my head hurt because I was laughing too much.

Overall, one would fear that the trailers would give away all the jokes, but in context, the film is completely different, in a good way. It balances the awkward and painful moments well, and comes together with a great climax that while may be a little clich, is crowd-pleasing all the way. In fact, when the film was over, my audience audibly clapped for a while to express their pleasure with the film. Give it a watch, and you will laugh. When you laugh and how often will depend, but rest assured, you will most likely laugh. And that's what a good comedy does. Especially in capable hands like this that the film gives to you.",1280620800,5,2502,4.694760820045558
4311489,4,B004AV5GX6,"This must be described as what I would call a ""painful"" comedy--you know, the kind where  the audience spends time laughing nervously at the increasingly painful plight of the hero.  Average entries in this category inspire nothing more than this jittery laughter.  Really good entries transcend the nervous wincing of the audience to develop genuine belly-laughs and group groans when the audience reaches the point where it almost can't stand it anymore.  Dinner for Schmucks is a member of the second category.  It is an exceptionally good ""painful"" comedy.

The story centers around young man who is an analyst in a financial services company specializing in buying companies and divesting their assets.  He gets an opportunity to advance in his company--if he brings the best ""village idiot"" to a dinner sponsored by his boss where the objective is to have the biggest laugh possible at a group of unsuspecting dinner guests brought by members of the company.

The hero, played by Paul Rudd, gets far more than he bargained for when he stumbles across an obsessive mouse taxidermist, played by Steve Carrell, and decides to take him to his boss' dinner. In the process, the taxidermist manages to nearly destroy the young man's life by losing him his girlfriend,losing his job, getting him audited, and attaching a deranged female stalker to him.  The increasing amount of pain for young Tim (Rudd) is palpable and reaches a point where the entire audience in the theater I was at groaned loudly and in unison.  The audience reaction was a really funny part of the movie for me.

I must admit that as the pain was heaped higher and higher, I came within a hair's breadth of walking out, and despite the laughs peppered liberally throughout the show, I found my self wondering how much longer the thing could continue.  I'm glad that I toughed it out, because the hilarious climax and denouement of the show are more than worth it.

The movie was directed by the same director who filmed ""Meet the Parents.""  Frankly, this show is a considerably better effort.  I only found out about the director after the movie.  Given my dislike for ""Meet the Parents,""  I doubt I would have gone had I known the director in advance.  However, in this film, Jay Roach does a wonderful job of building the misery of the audience to release it in the comedic climax at the end.

There are a number of memorable characters in the movie.  Carrell is a hoot as the lead ""schmuck."" Zack Galifianakis is hilarious as a deranged IRS agent. Jemaine Clement provides a very funny satirical take on a sex-crazed egotistical trendy artist. Jeff Dunham has a cute walk-on.

Highly recommended.",1280534400,5,2671,4.826373626373626

4311544,5,B004AV5GX6,"I fully recognize that loving this movie significantly lowers my IQ but I'd seen it (a few times) and had a friend over that I thought would enjoy it as well. I looked it up on my Roku and it wasn't available but for purchase (not free anywhere) and I had my heart set on it so I rented it for him. He wasn't as impressed as I was, perhaps it's a generational thing, but he did enjoy it. I'm not sorry. If I ever happen across this title in the $5 bin at Walmart, I'll buy it. I don't collect DVDs but I do appreciate having my favorite movies on hand to watch again and again. This definitely qualifies as one of those worthy to own.

I won't go into great detail of the story, as I'm assuming you've already read the synopsis, but I will tell you what I like it about it without giving anything away. It's a sweet story of a man in a position of life that doesn't have anything in common with someone (likely to be considered lesser by the majority) that he doesn't understand. He is burdened to basically exploit this lesser man in order to get a grand promotion but struggles with the humanity of such an act. Some would say this is pure stupidity, but then, I love that kind of humor. If you love The Office (the American one) and Jim Carrey's sense of humor (he isn't in it), I think you'll love this.

4311554,2,B004AV5GX6,"Dinner For Schmucks
 Let me begin by saying that there are some truly laugh out loud moments in this movie.  The people in the theater-including your reviewer-did just that.  Star Steve Carell (40 Year Old Virgin, Get Smart, Date Night) is truly at the top of his form.  He is able to lose himself in this role, which for someone as familiar and as famous as he, is worthy of special notice.  He has a scene early on where he negotiates the cash settlement for a traffic accident that is classic.
 Co-star Paul Rudd, a very likable young man, who played in the delightful Clueless and starred in the less so I love you man is in danger of forever being cast as the earnest, decent love interest with nothing more taxing or inspiring ever offered him.  His love interest, Jemaine Clement, is mearly beautiful in this film.  There is nothing in her character to make us believe that she could inspire the kind of hopeless devotion that Rudd shows for her.  Even the reliably very funny Zach Galifianakis (The Hangover) comes of only as mean, damaged and pathetic.  Both the Carell and Galifianakis characters, dumb, barely functional guys, work for the IRS, which is comic for the writers.
 The set up is that Rudd, an ambitious man on the rise, is invited to dinner by his boss. He is asked to bring someone so dense and stupid that the normal guests can ridicule the victim with the victim being none the wiser.  The premise is, for me, flawed.  But there is some good stuff too.  The world of contemporary art is savagely lampooned and portrayed as being inhabited by flamboyant, egotistical fools. And there is an uber wealthy European that is set up for the audience to hate and look down upon.  Did I say these were the good things?
 Director Jay Roach is very good at social satire.  He made all three of the Austin Powers movies and both of the Meet the Parents films as well.  He also made one of my favorite films of all time, the quirky Mystery Alaska.  He knows what it takes to please the public.  He may very well be right with this film, but I hope not.
 Carell plays a man who is badly equipped for life both intellectually and emotionally.  His two great talents are his deep and abiding innate goodness and his ability to build clever historical and personal dioramas using the corpses of dead mice of his figures.  His hobby is making mouse taxidermy, mostly vignettes of mice dressed as himself and his ex-wife.  This mentally and emotionally challenged man is stripped of every stitch of human dignity in the course of the movie.
 At one hour and 50 minutes, the PG-13 Dinner For Schmucks brings a lowly two saw blades.  You might like if if you can imagine and enjoy a man in a very dark room juggling flaming kittens.  The act has a certain value as spectacle but for me that is overcome by loathing and disgust for the act itself.",1470700800,,2852,4.487378640776699

4311584,5,B004AV5GX6,"Dinner for Schmucks generates a real mixed response--people either love it or hate it. I am one of the former. I think this is one of the best comedies ever made.

The concept of the film, based on the French film ""The Dinner Game,"" is that a group of snooty LA financiers each find a fool and invite him or her to a dinner which is a contest to see which which fool is most entertaining. The fools, of course, do not realize they are being made the subject of ridicule. Thus, the plot is predicated on this cruel joke.

I think many viewers, the ones who dislike ""Dinner for Schmucks,"" cannot get past this element. All they see is simpletons being abused and they and their self-righteousness become so outraged they cannot understand the film any better than that. Without getting into the psychology of people who take ritualistic umbrage at such things, all I can say is such people end up completely missing the point.

Although superficially ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is about the dinner game, it is really about the hero Tim, and how he learns transcend his shallow life as a financial analyst and appreciate the deeper meaning in life by knowing Barry, the idiot savant, he befriends as his contestant in the game. Barry's unintentional perceptiveness is like that of the fool of King Lear, awakening Barry to his own blindness. He gradually realizes that Barry's brilliant devotion to his mouse-taxidermy ""mousterpieces"" and their inspiration from Barry's loneliness and lost love, yet perpetual optimism, is something far beyond what he has in his own, seemingly ideal, life. By eventually coming to see Barry's pure and honest heart, Tim learns to recognize the callous and mean-spirited nature of his colleagues and his own former self, and to give it up for something better.",1445731200,,1785,4.826797385620915

I feel that half of the people writing low star reviews for this movie should have been cast as the ""schmucks.""  Some comments about no women in the board room, even though there are, and something about movies these days moving past romances as ""eye candy"" must have been written by people who have never seen any movies other than the care bear movies.  I would love to find a movie made in the past 10 years, if not since the beginning of film, that doesn't focus some sort of part towards ""eye candy"" as sex sells in this industry, and even that content is not a large portion of this film.

4311709,3,B004AV5GX6,"What does it take to be funny? The right situation, precise comedic timing, flawless acting? Sure all of
these, but something more. How about the mob mentality? Nothing makes you laugh more at a movie
that a hundred people or so joining you. In Dinner for Schmucks, starring Steve Carell and Paul Ruud,
having an audience laughing with you definitely helps.
Dinner for Schmucks is a remake of a reportedly better executed French film called The Dinner
Game. Tim (played by Ruud) is an upwardly mobile executive who is invited to a special dinner whereby
participants bring well, bring an idiot. The goal is to win the prize for bringing the biggest idiot.
Essentially, this is what will catapult Tim to the seventh floor an envious spot to all his sixth floor
colleagues. Tims girlfriend, Julie (beautifully played by Stephanie Szostak) does not like the idea at all,
and Tim assures her hes not going to participate. But he does. Especially since he just happens to
(literally) run into Barry (played by Carell), a taxidermist who creates 3D vignettes using dead mice.
Clearly what is not always necessary to be funny is a tightly crafted storyline and strong character
development as both are woefully lacking. The story unfolds clumsily to say the least as I found myself
rolling my eyes at the blatant disregard for quality storytelling. About two thirds into the film, when it
became apparent they were actually going to have a dinner scene I rolled my eyes again and whined,
Theyre going to make me sit through a dinner scene?
Carell and Ruud do what they always do in this film--Carell the idiot and Ruud the straight guy, but its
the great support cast that actually makes the film watchable. Zach Galifianakis plays Therman, Carells
boss at the IRS who uses mind control techniques to manipulate people. Jermaine Clement plays Kieran,
an artist who is managed by Ruuds girlfriend; his extreme art and lifestyle get big laughs",1408406400,3,1934,4.863636363636363

4311734,5,B004AV5GX6,"SPOILERS Dinner for Schmucks is one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years, possibly since Austin Powers. It's funny without getting as crude and disgusting as other recent funny comedies like Borat, Team America, Harold & Kumar, and Super Bad. The characters are likable with their funny flaws, and Steve Carell performs his role better than
anything I've seen from Adam Sandler, Will Farrell or any of the other current lead comics. Carell plays a not so bright, nerdy amateur taxidermist who makes dioramas featuring stuffed mice. But you like him because he's very talented at his hobby. Paul Rudd befriends him with an ulterior motive, to invite him to the title dinner to impress his boss - but humiliating him in the process. But even before the dinner, Carell, trying to helpful, creates a series of  misunderstandings that mess up Rudd's relationships. This makes up the bulk of the movie and is very funny, if typical comedic misunderstandings, well staged with good comic timing. SPOILER: But the dinner finally comes and that's the
outstanding part, as we see the schmucks invited really are better people than the snobs who invited them, just ordinary people with some extraordinary talents -- but intensely funny. This is one to watch over again every couple years.",1404259200,,1287,4.986046511627907

An hour and a half later I regret that choice.

The acting is stale and you never get the sense that Carrell isn't just playing the part of an idiot.  Rudd is bland and unlikable through about 95% of the film.  I won't spoil anything but let's say that you don't mind his character as much by the credits.  That isn't saying much and is the only reason I'm not giving it a single star.

4311908,3,B004AV5GX6,"If there's one man in Hollywood who knows how to create a ruckus, it's....uh, Robin Williams.  But if there's one DIRECTOR who knows how to consistently bring sequential chaos to his films, it's Jay Roach.  The man behind the Austin Powers and Meet the Parents trilogies, Roach's talents are the pinnacle of persistent, albeit uneducated, humor.  There's nothing sophisticated about him, but it's difficult to stand by idly and maintain a flat face during pandemonium that is rivaled only by vintage Python.

During this (dinner) party, you'll feel stupid.  Let's just get that out of the way immediately.  There are no high brow comedic moments to be found in Dinner for Schmucks.  It sticks to its slapstick strengths, and doesn't wander more than a few steps from said territory throughout.

This is a film that is absolutely determined to make you laugh by its principles, and will fight tooth and nail to assure us and itself that these goals are met.  Is it a flawed strategy?  Probably, and it certainly won't make any friends in the movie industry, but funny's funny, straight up; the audience's destination to the laugh rarely matters.

That said, this is hardly an excuse for everything.  Indeed, Roach's nutcase of a movie occasionally finds itself floundering under the unpredictability of its own comedy, often indulging in itself so much that it leaves its audience clueless and in the dark.  You'll know these moments when they arise, and it will be a struggle to find the proper emotional response.

More often than not, however, the movie hits its mark, relying on viciously quick cuts and the understanding of its lovely cast to set the tone and keep it there.  When all cylinders are blasting in synchronization, the movie's a senseless riot that will crack ribs.

It really owes its success to a series of performances that are committed to the cause; given what this movie may or may not represent in the genre - that is, a degradation - that's giving a lot.  Carell's performance here is the stuff of legend, reveling in so many absurdities and peculiar idiosyncrasies - and pulling each one off, no less - that there's simply no stopping the uproars when he's on the screen.  Rudd is quick to join the esoteric group of actors who excel at playing themselves in every performance, and Galifianakis, for what may be the first and last time in his career, finds himself in the presence of even more ridiculous personas.

For what it's worth, it all comes together more cohesively than you'd think.  The premise is, ultimately, a gimmick, a one - trick pony, but it's one that goes a long way towards giving you your money's worth in breathless laughs.",1324166400,,2672,4.817982456140351

I could tell by the trailer(s) that it wasn't gonna be a hysterically funny movie like say any of Judd Apatow's films.
To me, it looked more of a humorous kind of film. To be honest, with a few edits/changes, this would've easily been a family-type movie.
I got some laughs out of it though. I liked it for the performances. In my opinion, I thought Steve Carell and Paul Rudd were
equally great with their roles. Their chemistry is always spot on. The director who made this film made ""Meet the Parents"" and I kind of saw that.
This movie has the same look and feel as ""MTP"". I think ""MTP"" is funnier, but I still enjoyed ""Schmucks"", very much.
A lot of people didn't like this movie. I can see why and respect that. I'm not gonna disrespect other peoples' opinions or anything.
It all depends what your taste of movies or comedies are, that's all. I'm the kinda guy that appreciates movies for what they are and have to offer.
Well, I have over 850 movies so I think I ""should"" appreciate them :) I added this to my collection a while ago. I have it right next to ""I Love You, Man"", another good film starring Rudd. But all in all, I had a good time with ""Schmucks"". Good film.

I dislike most of the 'stupid' humor in things like Napolean dynamite, superbad, american pie etc. but for some reason this movie just struck every chord correctly. I've seen it twice in theaters (laughed out loud during the first time, chuckled silently the second) and once at home, and I've enjoyed it every time. The plot is extremely ridiculous, and the movie does get slow in a little parts, and I do admit most of the characters aren't fleshed out as well as they could be, but the movie consistently makes up for it with amazing acting from Steve Carell and some truly awkward and funny moments (the lunch scene with the Swiss people come to mind). I also really like how the vulture idiot guy from the dinner is that one guy from Mulholland Drive, another favourite movie of mine.

If you enjoy Steve Carell's role as Michael Scott on the Office, or you like a goofball/awkward comedy, then this movie won't disappoint. I have no idea why this plethora of negative reviews plagues this film - I guess comedy movies are really one of the more hit-or-miss types of cinema.

4311916,2,B004AV5GX6,"Sometimes my love a certain actor will force me to subject myself to films I would normally run far away from.  `Dinner for Schmucks' is one of those films that I probably would not have ever even entertained the notion of seeing had it not starred Paul Rudd; an actor who I have this weird crush on (he's so pinchably cute and his sense of humor sits very well with me).  So, regardless of my initially worry, I didn't really have to be talked into seeing this movie since there are moments when `really stupid funny' does just the trick.

So...

While I did laugh, and at one particular point I was actually crying in laughter (that whole Darla fight sequence was hysterical), when all was said and done I was disappointed in the direction taken with what could have been a no-nonsense laugh riot.  Instead, `Dinner for Schmucks' is either too dumb or too tame for its own good.  It needed to find a balance that worked, or go to the extreme.  It just felt like it was holding back too much in parts, and then in others it went too far in a way that wasn't funny.

The film tells the story of Tim.  Tim is a hard worker with a life that would be the envy of nearly every warm-blooded male.  He has a gorgeous apartment, a Porsche and a smoking hot French (?) girlfriend who obviously dotes on him.  When he is given the opportunity to clutch a much deserved promotion, his life course hits a snag.  It appears that the higher-ups in the company are, well, very mean people.  In fact, they host a dinner once a month where they invite unsuspecting idiots and make fun of them all evening.  Tim is hesitant, especially since his girlfriend is disgusted by the idea, but then fate intervenes and he meets Barry; a taxidermist who makes `mousterpieces' with dead mice.  But, Tim should have never talked to Barry or invited him to dinner because Barry is lonely and accident prone (in about every possible way) and is determined to `help' Tim in any way possible; which of course does far more damage than good.

I wish I could say that the acting saves this, but it really doesn't.  When the gags hit right, they hit hard...but it becomes apparent about halfway in that the gags that hit are few and far in-between.  Carell can play the lovable idiot well, and so you can't help but laugh at some of his quirks, but I didn't feel a real connect between him and Rudd.  Rudd, sadly, phones this one in as well.  I really LOVE this guy but his schick doesn't work so well here.  I also kind of hate it when the script maps out such a ridiculously frustrated situation.  People DO talk to one another, and it is very odd to me to believe that a woman who loves a man so much she wants to marry him would refuse to allow him to explain a situation fully before leaving him.  I also found the fact that the dinner itself was such a small part of the film, and I really wanted it to be the bulk of it.  THAT is where you really had potential to make this so stupid funny it was actually funny, but instead it felt lazy and underdeveloped.  Yes, Zack Galifianakis is HILARIOUS and he does make his ridiculous dialog feel somewhat inspired, but there was so much more that could have been done to make this better.

The clichs are a sad inclusion (why does every comedy of this nature have to distress every relationship only to resolve everything in such a similarly contrived manner?) but an expected one.  I just really thought that Rudd and Carell would carry this movie on their shoulders, but instead they kind of dropped the ball in a major way.",1313366400,2,3542,4.36793893129771
4311917,4,B004AV5GX6,"I found this movie to be a lot of fun.  Steve Carell was amazing.  He really went above and beyond in his role here.

Tim (Paul Rudd) is an up and coming business tycoon that is forced into going to a special dinner if he wants the promotion.  The theme of the dinner is a contest for the biggest loser you can find.  In walks Barry (Steve Carell).  Julie (Stephanie Szostak) is Tim's girlfriend and is very upset that he would even entertain this idea and leaves to go work with the artist Kieran (Jemaine Clement).  Barry volunteers to help Tim, whether he wants his help or not, and almost ruins everything.

4311928,3,B004AV5GX6,"I love Steve Carell. He's the perfect blend of nice, nasty, geeky-cool. So, of course, Dinner for Schmucks would eventually have to hit my orbit.

The premise held great promise. And the dinner party itself had terrific moments of all out quirk and bizarre. Almost worth the price of the rental. And there was a sweetness that Carrell channeled. His character is inept and intense all rolled into one wacky guy with some serious relational dysfunctions.

Barry (Carell)has quirk...my favorite was his defense mechanism. When being hit (which is actually pretty often throughout the film) he plays dead. Amusing. And one scene with Rudd's character, Tim, was laugh out loud funny as he tried to explain to his girlfriend that he was being the him she didn't know via some snappy dialogue.

Speaking of dialogue, ugh, there's some lameness throughout. The movie relies on adolescent sex humor over cleverness several times. Tim (Rudd) is being stalked by Darla and Barry (Carell) ends up causing that situation to explode. There's an awkward few scenes where Darla is a Tim-hungry woman intent on seducing whomever will get her to Tim. Way too long scene. And then there is Barry's boss who has a certain control over Barry. Another awkward scene with the multi-use of clinical term for a female body part. Finally, a (throw up in my mouth) sexy artist who really, really gets into his work. This film is not kid friendly.

4311933,3,B004AV5GX6,"`Dinner for Schmucks' is an easy going comedy starring Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd.

When Tim (Rudd) goes after a promotion he soon learns that his boss hosts an annual dinner party where each of his staff has to bring an `idiot' guest along with him. The most entertaining guest wins a trophy and the member of staff who brought him wins the promotion. Although Tim is initially appalled by the idea, this soon changes when he meets Barry (Carrell) who is an endearing, but bumbling man who makes assorted dioramas out of stuffed, dead mice. Barry brings chaos, but his own brand of charm, into Tim's life and before long the film is in full swing.

Carrell is very good as Barry, who you can't help but like despite his annoying tendencies. He tries so hard to please and although everything falls down around his ears, he acts with the best intentions. I found this a lot funnier than I expected and whilst it doesn't have much sophistication, it more than makes up for this in visual gags and slapstick humour.

Some reviewers have given this a rough ride when comparing it to the original, but having not seen the French version I am in no position to judge. I can say however, that taken on it's own merits it is an entertaining enough film and raises enough laughs to warrant being called a comedy. Everyone plays their roles well enough and this is worth watching for the hilarious, quirky and strangely charming mouse dioramas alone. This is good, but not great, but makes for an evenings entertaining viewing.

4311935,2,B004AV5GX6,"DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS isn't really a good movie in any standard way -- though it does end up being reasonably funny in the last half-hour, to salvage the experience of watching it somewhat -- but it is an excellent object lesson in how to take a good movie and dumb it down in every way possible. SCHMUCKS is a remake of the French film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dinner-Game/dp/B0000A1HQP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dinner Game</a>, which was elegant, smart, pared-down, and absolutely hilarious.

Where DINNER GAME had a morally ambiguous man at its center, SCHMUCKS has Paul Rudd, playing Paul Rudd, the good-natured befuddled bright-faced boy-man he always is. Where DINNER GAME dove right into its central situation -- privileged folks have a monthly party, to which each of them bring an ""idiot"" for their secret amusement -- SCHMUCKS has to spend a prefatory half-hour carefully signposting every element of the plot and making sure Rudd's character is up to the Hollywood standard of likability. And in every way that DINNER GAME was understated and smart, SCHMUCKS is big and stupid.

So SCHMUCKS spends nearly an hour -- a long, tedious, obvious hour, particularly to anyone who has seen Party -- setting its trite, cliched plot into careful place, and then finally starts running downhill, as much as it can. There is nothing at all that this movie does that DINNER GAME doesn't do twice as well, and there is no reason to see this movie unless you have a very low opinion of your own standards, or a masochistic taste for bad American comedy.",1302912000,3,1608,5.204633204633205

But--I also had faith in Steve Carell to make something special out of something silly. We were not disappointed.  Carell's quirky humor hit us just the right way.  Our family loved the movie and my tween hasn't stopped talking about it and quoting it since seeing it a couple of weeks ago.

I was prepared to love Carell (who has never disappointed except in the bland ""Evan Almightly"") and to like Paul Rudd, but the biggest surprise was Jemaine Clement's turn as the overbearing artist Kieran.  Kieran is pretentious, narcissistic, and also hilarious and genuinely kinder to Carell's ""loser"" Barry than Paul Rudd's character is.  I ended up finding Kieran to be a strangely likable character who also some of the craziest lines in the movie.

The actual ""Dinner for Winners"" event itself was suitably odd and mostly funny, mostly because of Barry's mind war with his arch-nemesis Therman played by Zach Galifinakis. I could take or leave most of the other oddball losers on hand.

The movie's PG-13 rating is accurate and we had to fast-forward a few scenes with the crazy stalker Darla since we were watching with a middle schooler, but honestly, the kid in the room was the one who loved it the most.

To my delight & surprise, it turned out to be a cute, funny, & well-acted film that deserves much more acclaim than it's getting on this site.

First of all, whoever did the casting for this movie deserves a big credit for any success this movie gets.  I don't recall ever raving about the cast - let alone a FANTASTIC SUPPORT CAST but it's worthy of a big mention here.  Steve (Barry) & Paul (Tim) put in a fine performance but the supporting cast really helped to carry this movie to an even higher level.  Lucy Punch who played the stalker girlfriend really sank her teeth into her role as did Jemaine Clement who played Kieran the artist and of course Zach is never funnier as when he's trying to look serious.  I've always enjoyed Larry Wilmore & Kristen Schaal and they didn't disappoint here either.  There are so many more I want to mention but I don't remember all their names but some faces were very familiar.  They all did a wonderful job and Steve & Paul also deserve kudos for allowing the other cast members to steal the spotlight in many scenes as that kind of sharing made the movie that much more enjoyable & hilarious.  Thank God this movie wasn't just an ego ride for these two stars.

The mice and the dioramas were too cute and adorable.  Heck, even THAT added to my overall enjoyment of this movie!  I also knew I enjoyed the heck out of this movie when I watched every single second of the Special features just so I could keep this feel good mood going for a little bit longer.

Don't get me wrong, we're not talking rocket science here this is a comedy after-all.  But I sat down to this movie not expecting much yet I got my funny-bone tickled and when the credits rolled, I was disappointed the movie had already ended.  I wasn't finished watching & wondering what other collaborations Barry & Kieran would come up with and succeed at!

Lucy Punch and Jemaine Clement, who are you and where have you been all my cinema life?!  Heck, I kept thinking Nick Kroll WAS Jemaine Clement until I saw Paul Rudd doing an interview where he picked on Jemaine for the way his name was spelled.  Paul said we here in the USA use an ""R"" when we spell Jermaine XD

To my surprise, it's a really funny movie.  It reminds me quite a bit of another movie I just saw, Todd Phillips'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Due-Date/dp/B004I9SJH0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Due Date</a>.

I think the reason this movie didn't do as well as it could have is because the trailers focused on the titular party, but it's actually a very small part of the movie.  In fact, aside from two (pretty big) laughs, it's the weakest aspect of the film.
The movie focuses on Carell's Barry, a socially isolated, awkward guy who falls into the lap of Rudd's Tim, who's desperate to get ahead in his company, and how Barry causes complete chaos for him.  Barry drives Tim insane with his mangling, but Tim keeps him around because he needs an ""idiot"" for his boss's special dinner and knows Barry is pure gold.
Tim's curator girlfriend finds the idea of the dinner repugnant and Tim's involvement plus bungled attempts at being a savior by Barry seemingly drive her right into the buffoonish arms of her biggest artist.
The bottom line is really this: If you find Carell's borderline mentally-challenged Barry funny, then you will enjoy this movie.  If you don't, you won't.  The comedy is VERY broad here.  Zach Galifianakis shows up as a coworker of Barry's who claims to be a master of ""mind control.""  Lucy Punch (looking downright Amazonian) is a nightmare one-night stand stalker who terrorizes Rudd's character.
I never really thought the film gave Rudd much to do -- he's just a bland, likable guy reacting to the madness.  He doesn't have a disdainful, peevish edge to him the way Robert Downey Jr. did in ""Due Date.""
But every time Carell delivered one of his awkward lines -- an arrested-development dunderhead who's as naive as he is misinformed about history -- I laughed.  And that's good enough for me.

He's got to find an ""idiot,"" and invite him to a business dinner where he, and other ""idiots"", will be the unwitting entertainment.

4311950,4,B004AV5GX6,"The movie concept was great. In fact the dinner with the schmucks was very funny, I just wish there had been more of it. Rather than concentrate on what the title of the film would have us believe the movie is about, it takes its time to get there. The movie is about the relationship of Paul Rudd and various people including his gf, ex-gf and Steve Carell, the schmuck he has selected to take to a dinner filled with schmucks. This is a monthly event hosted by his boss.

Steve, our schmuck, uses dead mice to make menageries of his life and the history of mankind. He is really a nice guy, who through his stupidity messes up the life of Paul Rudd. The movie makers decided the movie needed a heart warming message that schmucks have feelings too, not thinking that the audience doesn't really care. I think making Paul Rudd attend multiple parties, building up to this one would have been better than the trek these writers took.

The movie was funny when it wasn't overly stupid. The reason why we laughed at those Pink Panther movies because there was a sense of possibility in all that stupidity. When you cross that line to no possibility, as this movie sometimes does, it becomes just stupid.

Listen carefully to Steve Carell's lines as he mixes up words. ""After sex you curl up and assume a fecal position."" Funny without fart jokes. While the humor is adult, I wouldn't classify it as overly crude. Three and a half stars for sure.",1298764800,3,1443,4.5

It's not my favorite comedy but it definitely grew on me and now I'll watch it now and again just for fun (but I also have a substantial movie collection of over 300 movies to watch when I'm in the mood for a movie).

4311962,5,B004AV5GX6,"What people seem to mistake about this movie is that it is going to be a goofball comedy. In many ways it is, but you also have to realize that there is an element of dark comedy here also. Steve Carell's character does a good job of screwing up Paul Rudd's character's life here, and you almost get irritated at times by how far it goes. That is why this is a dark comedy. Some people like it, some don't. A good movie to compare this to would be The Cable Guy. If you're like me and became pretty annoyed with Jim Carrey's character in that movie, then the people behind it accomplished what they set out to do.

My only complaint is that there are far too many dark comedies coming out nowadays, as if Hollywood thinks that's what the public wants or something (i.e. Easy A, Funny People, and, from what I've heard, The Dilema). Granted I thought this was one of the better movies of its kind to come out, as Steve Carell's character is very likable despite the actions he takes. There is one point during the movie, right in the middle of the obligatory fight between the leads, that Steve Carell's character almost gets to the point that he destroys what defines him as a character, but luckily he pulls back before he can do so. I think that in real life we probably would have seen him go that far considering what he was going through at the time, but at the same time audiences view comedies to laugh, not to be depressed.

So yes, the darker comedy here makes this a little more realistic, and will probably evoke an emotional response from you now and then, but this is still a very funny movie. Mostly because of Steve Carell's character, surprisingly. I saw this for Paul Rudd, and he was almost way too serious here. Still, these two worked well together. They did so in Anchorman and in The 40-Year Old Virgin, and the same is true here. While this movie doesn't quite measure up to those two, I still think it is one of the better comedies to come out in 2010. My only big complaint about this movie is Zach Galifianakis, who I don't find that funny at all. He plays a much more annoying character than Steve Carell does, which is appropriate since he's the villain, but I think this actor will be seen in a different light after having viewed this movie. It's an unusual role for him, I'll leave it at that.

In conclusion, I recommend everyone thinking about seeing this movie should see it. I've never seen the original, but I tend to enjoy comedies a lot. Yes, it's on the darker side, but the movie never completely falls apart. It may tread on the edge a bit, but there is a happy ending for almost everyone to be had here.",1296777600,37,2645,4.350202429149798
4311963,2,B004AV5GX6,"I waited almost the entire movie for this to get funny. I realized that it was the last 15 minutes that concentrated the humor that could have been throughout the whole film.

The actual dinner (which took too long to get to, in my opinion) was chock full of fun and laughs, but it didn't make up for the movie as a whole.",1296777600,3,379,4.066666666666666
4311964,2,B004AV5GX6,"This movie clocks in at nearly 2 full hours.  The dinner scene (which is most of what was shown in the trailer) doesn't occur until the last third of the movie, so there are plot lines and long scenes which should have been cut or reduced since they make the movie just drag along.  There were some funny parts, but this movie just couldn't keep the comedy up for that long.

My other complaint is the tone was very mixed.  It tries to be over-the-top funny, somewhat serious, a farce and black comedy all in one movie.  I've never seen the French version, so maybe that one is more succesful with its tone, but this movie seemed all over the place.

4311988,4,B004AV5GX6,"Dinner for Schmucks is odd, bizarre, uneven, awkward, a bit predictable, but definitely not shallow and ultimately an entertaining comedy with heart. It takes a while for the momentum to build in this film, but the film's second half, where we learn more about Barry and we wait for the dinner scene, is worth the wait. There's some formula to the story line as well, but the entertainment is in the eccentric, offbeat characters, particularly Barry (Steve Carrell) and his fellow IRS co-worker (Zach Galifianakis ), who deliver some laughs.

In the film, Tim (Paul Rudd) is trying to climb the corporate ladder at his job. When Tim wows his boss with a sales pitch, he is unexpectedly invited to a dinner with some of the big shots. However, there's a catch. His boss has an unusual (and mean-spirited) tradition of having a contest to see who can bring the biggest imbecile to the company dinner. Tim has a random encounter with Barry, who stumbles in front of his car. Barry is an odd sort of fellow, and he has an unusual hobby of recreating works of art with stuffed mice. Tim believes he's found his guy for the dinner. However, when Barry accidentally shows up a day early to Tim's place, he begins to inadvertently wreak havoc on Tim's personal life, particularly his relationship with his girlfriend, Julie. Tim can't seem to get Barry away long enough to correct things, and there are some great antics as we wait for the dinner the next day.

The odd assortment of characters adds to the film's entertainment. Clearly Steve Carrell was made for this role of Barry, and he makes the film more enjoyable. Carrell brings that innocent stupidity to his character that makes you sympathize with him. There's a great moment when Barry takes Tim to meet one of his coworkers (Zach Galifianakis), who supposedly can read minds. Barry is unable to overcome his coworker's ""power"" of mental detection. Later, Barry and his coworker square off in a battle of mind over mind at the dinner party. The dinner party scene, with its brand of oddballs, is comical as well.

Despite the mean-spiritedness at times in the film, Dinner for Schmucks is essentially a film with heart. Tim's character begins to change, as he feels a sense of guilt for what he is putting Barry through. Barry has a simple, innocent quality that makes him quite sympathetic. The film's resolution was fairly predictable, and maybe the film was a tad too long (just under two hours), but I don't think this film is as bad as people are making it out to be.

The extras include some outtakes, deleted scenes, and some behind the scenes with the cast.

With the exception of several, isolated, instances, this comedy is not funny. The problem is the script and therefore the directing, pure and simple, not the acting. Regardless of the French version, this is another instance of an old, re-rehashed theme beaten to death by Hollywood: a social misfit who accidentally creates havoc gets superglued to the straight guy, driving him bonkers, but by the end of the film the misfit endears himself to the straight guy and even saves him from some problem or other. Like I said, an old, old cliche done to death (You Me and Dupree is a relatively recent one, for example; What About Bob? had the saving grace that the straight guy never embraces the misfit and is instead driven mad).",1294704000,2,884,4.594936708860759

The story plot must have been written by the same people as the old 60's version of Batman and Robin. POW,ZAP, BAM.  Are all the screen writer in Hollywood really dead, they couldn't have somehow put a twist to this movie to pull it out of the trash.  I kept thinking that in the end, STEVE was in on a plot, to make Paul look foolish.  THAT their whole meeting was as they put it not by chance, that Paul had been set up by a bad joke created by his co-workers and STEVE was indeed in on it the whole time and they would reveal this at the dinner. BUT NO, NO ONE was smart enough to put an intelligent twist in the movie like that. The Mind Control Thing and the bird flying out the window, with the guys finger was so absolutely childished that this show made DUMB AND DUMBER look like an OCAR WINNER.

My guess is that this might be a good movie for an age group of 5 to 10 years old, but there is some content that does suggest sexual situations. Was this show funny... NO.... Absolutely stupid.  The worse show I have ever spent money on.

Now that I have completely trashed this movie I just rented for 5 bucks, let me say this. I DID FIND Steve's portrail of HIS Character absolutely brillent. Skipping from half mental to totally normal and back again. This was excellent. Steve was brillent. Paul was awkward.

Many reviewers believe that this movie falls on the two edges of it's comedic and narrative sword, but the deeper meaning is lost.

Though the characters are not redeemed, that is their redeeming quality.  The idiots may live in a world of their own, but it is a world of creativity and freedom.  This movie strikes a sharp contrast between their world and the world of the average person; an average person living within the confines of a scripted life.

This movie isn't about comedic redemption or even the uncomfortable situations.  This movie is about the viewer, and how he grows to appreciate the characters, even as they do not change.  Perhaps the idiots have it right.  Perhaps the average person has it wrong.  The characters are people, and some people are better at things than others.  Despite this fact, those that society looks down upon live with the greatest freedom of all:  Freedom of their own existence; unobstructed by convention, regardless of their merit in common life.

4312008,3,B004AV5GX6,"""Dinner for Schmucks"" has a great premise for a film that just isn't developed to its full potential. That doesn't mean that Steve Carell (""The Office"")and Zach Galifianakis (""The Hangover"")don't have their entertaining moments. If trimmed to about 80 or 90 minutes ""Dinner for Schmucks"" would have been nearly perfect and if Paul Rudd was given something to play other than a nice guy trying to get ahead, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" could have been a much better movie. Add in the fact that director Jay Roach focuses too much on trying to get us to care for the characters and unfortunately it gets in the way of the comedic antics deflating some of the best moments in the film. Still, ""Dinner for Schmucks"" isn't a BAD movie and has its moments it just doesn't live up to its potential.

For those interested in a summary of the plot it's at the end of this review.

For those who are interested in such stuff the film receives a nice looking transfer and has some nice extras including the gag reel, deleted scenes and a number of featurettes on the production of the film and one that focuses on the production of the dioramas. They are actually pretty good although there is a unfunny featurette that allows us to meet the various contestants to be the best ""schmuck"".

Rudd plays Tim who wants to work his way up the corporate ladder and is given the opportunity to rub elbows with his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood)at a dinner where the employee that brings the most idiotic, bizarre guest wins kudos and maybe gets that office on the 7th floor. Tim thinks he has found a ringer when he accidently hits Barry (Steve Carell)with his car. Barry an amateur taxidermy takes dead mice and puts them into dioramas representing modern art.

I'm sure on paper ""Dinner for Schmucks"" looked like a perfect project for everyone involved but director Jay Roach creates a number of weird and wacky characters and then doesn't allow us to laugh at their wackiness. We could like and care for the characters in a film like ""The Hangover"" for example and still recognize that they were idiots wringing humor out of their situation but here were not given that opportunity and it deflates a promising comedy robbing it of much of its humor.

I'd suggest renting ""Dinner for Schmucks"".",1294617600,2,2276,4.68

Interestingly enough, my favorite parts of the movie are the parts in which Steve's character is absent.  In fact, if they had completely removed his character and just wrote a script without that character, this movie would have been better.

Again, not to say Steve's performance wasn't decent, but rather, the script as far as his character was concerned just didn't work for me.

Also, parts of the script felt contrived, moreso than a comedy should.

It wasn't even the unfunny-but-maybe-if-you're-weird-you'd-laugh stuff like the Coen brothers create; it was just strange.

I think they probably overdid it with Steve C's character. News Flash: people do not want to laugh at a character who is clearly suffering from real mental problems (the sad kind like depression or loneliness, not the ""funny"" kind like Tourette's in movies such as Deuce Bigalo).

Ironically, in this movie Steve's character is invited to a party to be laughed at and the moral is that it's rude to laugh.

Maybe I'm an idiot, but I was tearing up in the theater from all the laughs. Steve Carell's destructive through stupidity schtick works, and Paul Rudd nails it as the straight man.

After watching the movie a second time on DVD, it's still great. As I expected, Schmucks has re-watchability, and the laughs were still there even when I knew what was going to happen.

If you're looking a movie to compare it to, it's definitely the same type of comedy as Dumb and Dumber. As in, can anybody really be that stupid? The answer, probably not, but who cares?",1294185600,4,761,4.421428571428572
4312028,3,B004AV5GX6,"This movie had a choice to make going in. Either jump off the deep end, make a mockery of everything, and fearlessly laugh at the uniqueness of others. Revel in the schadenfreude. The other option is to be self righteousness; take the sentimental road not taken by many. Invite the audience to the eponymous dinner for schmucks, even tempt us with snickering and smirks along the way, then entertain us with awkward absurdity during the main course, and then shove the guilty mirror of condescension in our faces.

Sadly, the movie takes the latter route, and it never lives up to the lofty, post-Hangover expectations.  Stuck between Apatow and chick-flick is not the safest bet for box office success.

Desperate to impress his girlfriend and get a promotion, Tim (Paul Rudd) finds his opportunity through some inside knowledge of an eccentric, foreign multi-millionaire named Mueller (David Williams). To Tim's surprise, he nails his one opportunity with his boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) by revealing his knowledge of Mueller, and learns of a dirty company secret...the dinner for schmucks. If he brings the biggest idiot to the dinner, he is guaranteed the promotion. Shortly thereafter serendipity delivers into Tim's life a man named Barry (Steve Carell), a talented mouse taxidermist (he creates anthropomorphic Mouseterpieces), a well meaning but awkward imbecile, an utter irritation with impeccably bad timing. Forrest Gump without the charm, good luck, or amiability. Too stupid to be outside of an institution, Barry is a 10-hour family car ride in a cramped VW Bug.

Along the way we meet a cast of characters, most importantly Tim's art curator girlfriend Julie (Stephanie Szostak), who looks down upon the dinner's concept and wants Tim to avoid the dinner, bizarre artist Kieran (Jemaine Clement), and fellow invited idiot Therman (Zach Galifianakis).

Despite picking up during the absurd dinner, the hearty laughs come unevenly. More childish than funny, Carell basically imitates a navely harmless but nonetheless bothersome child; in other words, he just plays Brick Tamland from Anchorman. Rudd does what Rudd does, nothing more nothing less. Even Galifianakis falls below his standard hilarity. The only refreshing contribution is Clement's completely over the top artist Kieran, who wears a Satyr costume like nobody's business, makes love with models in body paint, and is intriguingly funny. Strange but interesting guy.

Take it from me; this meal is a barely palatable, sour and sweet combo. Cancel your reservation.

4312029,2,B004AV5GX6,"It was mildly funny at times. But I have to say this is Steve Carell's worst. Not saying it was his fault but the character he played was not a Steve Carell character. It was more of a Jim Carrey/Ace Ventura character. Steve Carell doesn't need to try to be funny. He just is all by himself. The writing made him resort to 13 year old humor and it wasn't really needed. Carell is much funnier when he plays roles like he played in Dan in real life, 40 year old virgin, and Date Night. Not saying those movies were great but his roles in them were twice as funny. And in those he wasn't resorting to the type of humor found in this movie.

Don't get me wrong, there were times in this movie that made me laugh but it still wasn't really worth the time I put into it to watch. Don't watch this expecting classic Steve Carell. Your 14 year old might like it though",1294185600,4,861,4.125

I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was very well filmed, well acted, and seemed to flow quite well. I never really thought about it, but Steve Carell and Paul Rudd work perfectly together. They really balance each other out and mix the perfect amount of humor and crazy situations. Steve Carell cracked me up most of the movie simply with his facial expressions.

I found this movie to be very entertaining and I was highly anticipating what would happen next. It was a little predictable, however it was still very entertaining.

4312031,1,B004AV5GX6,"I can't remember the last time I watched such an awfully un-funny comedy. I had extremely high expectations given the talented duo of lead actors, and perhaps that fact has tainted my opinion, but this crapfest was just that: a giant festival of crap. I simply can't think of the words to accurately describe what a horrible, abysmal, and downright awful trainwreck of a movie this was. Steve Carrell obviously tried to make the best of the character he was given, but even his skill was no match for the dreck the writers came up with.

I've never written a review for anything anywhere before but I felt compelled to write one here in the hope that at least one person would be saved from the traumatic spiral of festering poop that is Dinner For Schmucks. Avoid, avoid, avoid!",1294099200,8,779,4.60431654676259

4312033,1,B004AV5GX6,"No spoilers in this review - don't worry.

This must be a polarizing movie for some reason - food for someone's psychology PhD perhaps?  I absolutely could not stand any scene with Steve Carell except the very end where he switches out of character.  I don't mind the guy in other movies but in this one he was painful.

Paul Rudd is great - he's a likable version of Ben Affleck - the guy should get more and better roles - he's underrated.

The psychotic stalker ""girlfriend"" is also cringe material - plus doesn't make any sense as a human being.

I absolutely loved the office scenes - great Dilbert material spilling over everywhere, they could have made sooo much more of this - that would have been really funny.

It struck me during the movie that not since Jerry Lewis have I had such a cringe reaction - I can't stand him either - overacting and being clumsy while grimacing is not funny.

So, if, like me, you never liked Jerry Lewis - stay away from this movie - if you are one of the many who liked Jerry Lewis, then perhaps this is for you.",1293580800,10,1054,4.314720812182741

The director's commentary read in a loopy French accent?  Outtakes in which the actors are randomly pelted with cream pies by midgets?  A hidden audio track wherein key pieces of dialogue are replaced with flatulent sound effects?  A musical cameo featuring Will Ferrell and Jack Black riding atop a donkey? A copy of the contract Zack Galifianakis signed when he sold his soul?  Seriously - it's hard to improve upon perfection; I don't think I've laughed so hard in all my life.

4312036,4,B004AV5GX6,"Dinner For Schmucks is a remake of the French film, The Dinner Game. It stars Steve Carell as Barry Speck, and Paul Rudd as the main character, Tim Conrad. In the movie, Tim has to get a promotion at his job so he can impress his girlfriend, Julie. His superiors decide to have the promotion hinge on how well he plays their ""dinner for schmucks"" game, which involves bringing weird people to dinner to make fun of them. If Tim can find the weirdest person he wins the promotion. After he and Julie decide that it's best not to attend the dinner, Destiny sends Barry into the street where Tim is heading home. He gets hit and the drama begins.

Steve Carell dishes out one of his greatest performances I've ever seen. His character is always getting into trouble, but maintains lovability throughout the film. Paul Rudd does a perfect job realistically keeping his character's cool where I'd have already lost it and gone insane. The more recent films Paul Rudd has been in usually have a message, which this movie does as well (that was a bad way to say that). Keep an eye open for Zach Galifianakis's performance as an IRS worker who's hobby is mind control. Watch out for the eccentric artist that Jemaine Clement plays. That's a warning not a recommendation.

This movie has a great plot and cast, but doesn't live up to the original story or use most of the cast as they usually are in other movies. Don't get me wrong this movie is hilarious, touching, and has a great message. Dinner for Schmucks is nothing more than a really great comedy. Definitely see it.",1292457600,3,1566,4.549645390070922
4312058,3,B004AV5GX6,"Dinner for Schmucks is a lot like getting a Shiatsu massage from a member of the women's German Olympic weightlifting team. Nice at first and you end up feeling good about it by the time it's over, but it can sure get uncomfortable along the way. The movie is funny. Very funny at times. At other times I feel like pulling  my hair. It's a mixed bag. However when you get down to it I didn't regret watching it and look back remembering the fun stuff more than the stuff I complain about.

The movie is a situation comedy. One dude (Paul Rudd) wants to rise up the corporate ladder and one of way of doing it is to get a schmuck for this joke dinner party. Dude finds a schmuck (Steve Carell), who then latches onto him and all sorts of embarrassingly crazy stuff happens. It's similar comedy that you would find in Due Date (maybe it's a Zack Galifianakis thing as he is in both movies). Sometimes it's pretty funny and sometimes you just wish they would quit running the gag as long as they do. In the middle of the movie it's especially exasperating and borders on being painfully droll. There is only so many times (and minutes) I can stand seeing Carell destroy Rudd's life in various little ways.

It's when they get off on that kick and move further into the absurdities and quirkiness of the characters that the comedy starts to take off for me. Jemaine Clement as the eccentric artist Kieran gives a refreshingly out of the box performance, Galifianakis' character is weird but gels right in with Carell. Much of the good stuff happens in the beginning and the penultimate ""dinner"" scene at the end of the movie. It's makes it worth the wait when you get there. You get a blind swordsman making funny challenges, a pet psychic talking to the food, even Jeff Dunham married to one of his dummies. There is a fair amount of comedy gold in the rough.

The movie is not just all hijinks as the main characters do a little soul searching and maturing throughout the movie. This includes Steve Carell's character getting a little growth along with Rudd's character learning a life lesson suitable for an after school special. The movie is far from perfect, but it does have heart.

The Blu-Ray release will be in AVC 16x9 widescreen format in 1080p with audio in 5.1 DTS-HD (dvd will be in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround). Extra features will be the following:

The Biggest Schmucks in the World featurette - Interviews from the stars. More of a promotional fluff piece than anything else.

""Schmuck Ups"" - Gag reel. Standard stuff like messing up lines and being goofy on the set, but it's funny.

Deleted scenes - Kinda funny, but nothing that the movie needed to keep.

The Men Behind the Mousterpieces - Self explanatory. About the Chiodo Brothers and their mouse dioramas. A Blu-Ray exclusive presented in High Definition.

Meet the Winners - Another Hi Def BD exclusive. A little character profile piece for the ""schmucks"" at the dinner.

Paul and Steve: The Decision - A sketch piece spoofing the LeBron James Press Conference (also a BD exclusive in Hi Def).

Dinner for Schmucks isn't for everyone. You gotta enjoy quirky comedy. And you gotta enjoy the kind of comedy that puts you in awkward moments. For those of you who do enjoy that you have a little gem here. For those who enjoy some, but not all I still say at least do a rental. You may be glad you did.",1291939200,20,3370,4.533772652388797
4312059,3,B004AV5GX6,"25 minutes into the movie, my IQ has dropped 25 points. I now have an IQ of -25, pull the plug now.

The movie has Steve Carell as one of the main characters (the guy from OFFICE, GET SMART, DATE NIGHT).
That should have warned you about the mentality of this movie.

Anyhow, it's amusing, but in a stupid OMG-WTH-IS-HE-SH*TTIN-ME-1+1=11? Kind of way. However, I've seen similar movies. I wouldn't watch this in the theater and if I did, I wouldn't bring anyone I really...actually...care and love. Maybe someone I hate or not really care for. Burns time, has so many over the top ridiculous moments.

The movie casts Steve Carell as Berry, Paul Rudd as Tim, and Stephanie Szostak as Julie. Julie is Tim's girlfriend. Tim has proposed to her twice, but has yet to receive a definite answer. I'll restrain myself from releasing the full plot, but the reason the movie is titled ""Dinner for Schmucks"" is because the movie involves inviting schmucks (SLANG- NOUN: incompetent, obnoxious, contemptible person)  over for dinner. The goal of the invitation is to see who is the biggest schmuck of them all. A competition of schmucks. You can guess who's the schmuck between those three characters, it's an easy guess.

That said, I'll let you watch the movie to find out the rest. Should you watch it? Sure, you might end up enjoying the dumbed down humor more than I did. It's amusing sometimes and does give you some laugh-out-loud occasions, but it's also the kind of humor that makes you, the viewer, embarrass just to watch it.",1291420800,6,1526,4.7218045112781954

I love The Office but Steve Carell was definitely at his funniest in this role, period!

He soon learns that it's a dinner where rich people make fun of the people they bring. Tim accidentally runs into a man named Barry Speck with his car. He decides to invite him to the dinner. Tim tries to survive Barry's silly antics before the dinner even starts. This is a very fun movie to watch. I highly recommend DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS!!!",1289347200,6,636,4.444444444444445
4312065,2,B004AV5GX6,"The first 30 minutes of this film are very very funny and seemed to indicate that this film was moving in a positive direction. However, soon after Rudd meets Carell's character the idiot formula gets very stale very quickly. Carell's character is so bad in fact, that he can only be tolerated in small doses, something lost on the scriptwriter and director of this movie.

This movie should have been primarily about Rudd interspersed with smatterings of Carell, the bumbling idiot, at his side. However, once Carell comes on screen he never leaves for the rest of the movie. And that is really what brings the movie down to the point of being almost unwatchable. Thankfully it manages to tie things together nicely at the end in a cute and humorous way, but it still doesn't make up for half the movie being some of the worst film making I've ever seen.

I was tempted to deliver a one star rating on this one, but I have to be honest and say that some moments are genuinely funny and I found myself laughing quite a bit. However, I found myself equally cursing the film during it's midpoint lull of horrible comedy that few would find funny. I recommend renting this one so you can fast forward through these painfully bad scenes.

Strangely enough, the feel good message of the film seemed to be lost on the audience. There was something highly ironic about a film teaching us to be kind to idiots while using those same idiots to generate all of it's laughs.

Honestly there was a great film somewhere amidst the rubble, but it just got completely bungled by moving the focus too much on Carell's stupidity and not enough on Judd's transformative journey.

On a final note I also want to add that Jemaine Clement is, as always, completely brilliant in this film in the role of Kieran.",1282608000,,1789,4.578125
4312066,4,B004AV5GX6,"Tim (Paul Rudd) is an analyst trying to get a big promotion, mainly to impress the love of his life, Julie.  His boss tells him to accompany him and his co-workers to their dinner where they bring idiots to make fun of them.  Tim thinks this is messed up, and so does his girlfriend Julie.  He tells her he won't go.  The next day he ends up hitting Barry (Steve Carell) with his car.  Barry is a lonely taxdermist who stuffs dead mice and puts them in costumes to create scenes.  Some are scenes from everyday life, like two mice having a picnic, or famous re-created works of art, like The Last Supper.  Tim realizes Barry is the perfect idiot to bring to dinner.  Barry thinks it is just a dinner with friends and it very excited to go, since no one really invites him anywhere.  Tim plans on keeping this a secret from Julie, but she finds out and breaks up with him.  That night and the next day consists of Tim and Barry trying to get her back, with Barry unintentionally complicating Tim's life even more.

I came to this movie not expecting much.  A friend dragged me along to see it.  I had read some bad reviews and only went to see it because Steve Carell was in it.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good this movie was. Critics were too harsh on this one.  The few trailers and promotions I saw did not do it any justice either.

Steve Carell does a great job as Barry, and is really perfect for his character.  He is the one making all of jokes, as you would expect.  The movie is very funny, but not quite hilarious. Everyone in the theater was laughing out loud.  Dinner for Schmucks is unique as well.

Dinner For Schmucks actually had a lot of heart.  The movie took itself seriously (for a comedy), which I liked.  It's goofy and funny but has a story to tell.  The dinner is not really the main story.  I think a lot of people thought that was the case and lost interest in seeing it.  The underlying plot is how Barry's wife left him and his heartbreak.  His mice are his only friends, and he conveys his feelings through the scenes he creates.  It won't move you to tears, but I definitley started to pity the poor guy.  The characters, even mean Tim, have emotional depth.  Eventually Tim and his co-workers at the dinners realize they are the real schmucks, and there is a happy ending.

The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of five is that it could have been more funny, and it was a little long.  Just don't go in with your hopes too high.  My friend did that and she enjoyed it, but was slightly dissapointed.  People have been saying it's mean, which it is, but eventually the joke is on the CEO's at the dinner, not the ""schmucks"".  I did not feel mean laughing at the jokes AT ALL.  I highly reccomend this movie, for it has a lot of laughs and a lot of heart.",1282176000,4,2798,4.244781783681215
