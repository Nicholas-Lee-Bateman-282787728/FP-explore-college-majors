8102626,5,B000DN5W2U,"This is a regular, daily series on PBS in NYC. Having moved to another state, I was extremely disappointed that it is not on our local PBS cable channel. This wonderful series incorporates classical dance into lovely storylines. What I liked best was that the dancers are both female and male, thus appealing to boys and girls. It is filmed live on a set (no audience) and the music is classical. The sets are basic, but the characters use their imaginations and colorful props to play out a storyline. If I remember correctly, there is a narrator and the characters do not speak. My son watched this until age two. It was the only t.v. he was allowed to watch. I am so thrilled to find this on dvd as it is not played on PBS (to my knowledge) outside the New York metropolitan area. P.S. who cares if the narrator uses silly voices, the children focus on the dance, not his voice! Great way to expose children to classical dance in a very wholesome, imaginative way.",1151280000,3,967,4.468926553672317
