You get a privileged peek into the classrooms of Jascha Heifetz at the University of Southern California. You get to watch him instruct his pupils and discern the interpretations of each piece they play. (And these videos have some great selections on them- Bach's Ciaccona, Wieniawski's Polonaise Brilliant No. 2, Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D Maj, Brahms Violin Concerto in D Maj, Op. 77, Mvt. 1, and on and on...)
You see Heifetz looking almost bored as he listens sometimes- and most the music he knows so well he doesn't even have to look at it to realize if the students are missing something. Other times, he gets almost violent as he corrects the students, or he starts smiling with such satisfaction as they play a beautiful part correctly. And besides all that, you are witnessing virtuosos in training (Erick Friedman is especially mesmerizing)!
For a Heifetz fan, this is invaluable- you get a look at ""Heifetz the teacher"" and gain a little more insight into such a non-public man. For a student or teacher of the violin, I must voice the same opinion. You will never regret buying these if you love music, violin, or Heifetz (or better yet- all!).",975628800,16,1205,4.826086956521739
