4439753,4,B004ODLUDK,"I know what you're thinking the minute you hear the title of this new DVD: who is Louis Prima? But for many fans they love the voice of the fun loving singer from way back when. And you'll be stunned when I tell you that anyone who's seen THE JUNGLE BOOK knows Louis. He was the voice of King Louie of the apes. Yeah, that was him!

His music and playing can be heard in movies like CASINO, RAGING BULL and ANALYZE THIS. This connects him with a number of movies based in the Italian scene of the fifties. But the fact was that Prima was loved by all.

Prima was noted for his jazz and swing styled playing and singing. At ease with a trumpet or vocally, Prima led his band into fame and fortune and was recognized by many as a talent to be reckoned with. There are a number of tunes he was famous for and while not all are represented here at least a few are.

The disc is made up of both commentary by Prima's son and by the performances collected for the disc. It's those performances that make it worth watching and having in your collection. If you've never heard Prima then this is a good place to start.

Included are songs where he sings with Keely Smith (who became his fourth wife) and with Gia Maione (his fifth wife). Most recognizable for many will be the songs ""Buona Sera"" and ""Just a Gigolo"" which was later a hit for David Lee Roth. But there are more great tunes to be witnessed and enjoyed on this disc.

The greatest thing that the disc offers is a chance to see a legend actually perform his own material. It's rare that this sort of opportunity exists and when it does it should be taken advantage of. And at a price of just $16, it's worth the investment for music, jazz and swing fans.

Here is a track listing for those interested:

4439754,5,B004ODLUDK,"I'm a huge Prima fan and can never tire of seeing performances of him.

This DVD was ""written, produced and directed by"" Joe Lauro of Historic Films, who has a massive archive of rare musical performances on film, in conjunction with the Prima Archive.

It consists of the 61-minute ""feature"" which was aired on some PBS stations earlier this year. This is ""hosted"" by Louis Prima Jr. who is a bit stiff and keeps saying ""my father did"" a lot. But Lauro was smart in indexing these intros so you can skip ahead on repeat viewings. The performances are - of course - great and all are complete songs - except one. The earliest is ""Loch Lomond"" from 1937 film  (great print but the sound is muffled) and last is Prima in 1971 with a young band - but still Sam Butera. There are some Keely Smith (his first wife and singing partner for seven years) numbers and some Gia Maione (later his second wife and singing partner) numbers and a lot from Ed Sullivan shows. (One from a Doris Day show too!). A nice selection.

The bonuses total 25 minutes. The longest is the rare 15-minute short ""Swing It"" from 1936. The sprocket must have stuck once or twice but the film is still fun. Then there is ""Sing Sing Sing"" (the Prima composition that became Benny Goodman's theme song) from 1943's Big Band Parade, A complete song in color from the Dinah Shore program comes next, followed by the funny ""Story about the dog"" from a 1965 Bob Hope Special. The ""Bonuses"" close with Louis Jr.and his band performing ""Jump Jive and Wail"" in Vegas. This last piece was filmed from the back of the room and the sound comes from the house speaker system so - sadly - there is a LOT of echo.

The package includes a four-page color booklet with a nice 3-page essay (uncredited by probably by Lauro) and two photos from the Prima archive.

But - for Prima fans - I can recommend this DVD that is a LOT cheaper than the price PBS stations were charging during their begathons. And for those who only know Prima from Disney's The Jungle Book or his recordings used in commercials or on soundtracks, this is a great chance to experience one of THE hardest working guys on the Las Vegas nightclub scene.

I was going to deduct a star for the sound on Louis Jr's performance in the bonuses. But the other rare material here more than offsets that so the DVD gets five stars.

Discover Louis. There will never be another like him!

4439798,5,B004ODLUDK,This is a great DVD. I will buy more of this for gifts. Louie plays his heart out and also makes us laugh. I wish there were more DVDs of him. He was one of a kind. I love this DVD. One of my favorites.,1344124800,2,202,3.511111111111111
4439799,5,B004ODLUDK,"The band was hot,Las Vegas was hot and Louis and Sam Butera lit up the stage whenever they performed! I was lucky enough to see Sam Butera in concert and now I can watch his mentor whenever I want to with this DVD! Louis is magic!",1342915200,,230,4.021739130434782
4439800,5,B004ODLUDK,"Well, let me tell 'ya, having hosted my own jazz/swing/big band radio show in the past, I had only one Louis Prima CD.  And it was a compilation.  So suffice it to say, I was not the biggest Prima fan.  Well, after buying and viewing this DVD, my ""Prima-appreciation meter"" has taken a one-eighty!  I can't stop watching it!  Let's get to the nitty-gritty...both positive and negative.

This DVD is chock full of live performances of Prima & Company showcasing all phases of his career from 1936-1973.  And don't forget the ""bonus extras"" as I did until the third time I viewed this gem.

The DVD is hosted by Louis Prima, Jr. and, unfortunatley, this would be one of the negative aspects of the DVD.  His son does a lackluster job at best and not only seems awkward and ""cue-carded"" in his reading, but I think, in all honesty, sets the ""quality documentary narrator"" genre back about thirty years!  Sorry Louis, Jr.

The early bio info is nice and gets right to the point,  and it remembers that we are here for the performances.  And performances there are!

Right from the start with 1937's ""The Bonnie Banks O'Loch Lomand"" (and I wish we could here this one in stereo!), you'll see that this man's body is in motion all the time.  He can't stop moving!...and it's contagious!  Throughout this entire DVD you will notice (among many other things) that Mr. Prima actually seems to be enjoying himself.  It's not work for this guy.  He LOVES what he does and it shows in every performance.  From the first tune we go to 1943's solo version of ""That Old Black Magic"" and realize that Prima was a superb big band singer.  Watch for when he throws his head back and scream ""baby!"".  Priceless!  He's in the groove man!

The early TV appearances are great gems too.  1949's ""I'll Be Seeing You"" features Prima sans toupee' and demonstrating what a great swingin' trumpet player he really was!

The mid 50's saw the introduction of a small group foregoing the full orchestra.  Enter...Ms. Keely Smith.  Now, I'll be up front with you.  She had/has a great voice.  And I know critically their ""stage presence"" was a big hit with the public...what with her looking bored as Prima pranced and danced wildly about the stage.  But you know?...it gets old with me pretty quick.  You can tell she has absolutely no real comedic abilities (she comes across as being and looking corny whenever she attempts to be funny)...tell me I'm wrong here...am I?  She can't dance either.  But, in all honesty, she has a great set of pipes.  And there is no denying that they had a number of popular hits (""That Old Black Magic"", ""Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody"", and ""I've Got You Under My Skin"")that help define Louis Prima's repertoir.

Also in the mid 50's...enter tenor saxophonist Sam Butera (along with the Witnesses).  My most heartfelt comment about this man is that he makes the DVD worth at least three times what I paid for it!  He's a master at what he does with Prima.  I don't care if it was part of the ""act"" or not.  Look at Sam and tell me he doesn't convince you that he'd rather be no other place than right where he is, reacting, laughing, playing, and swingin'.  He's an underated genius and I beleive he just loved doing what he did.  He stayed with Louis for over 20 years.  Check out his solos on ""Oh Marie"" and ""Just a Gigolo"".  Which then brings me to one of my two fave performances on this DVD...1960's ""Coolin'"" from the movie ""Twist All Night"" (sadly, omitted from your local PBS showing to make it stay within the hour time slot).  It's hilarious and shows how Prima and Butera worked off of each others' talents.  They told a story well, that's for sure!  You'll find yourself watching this one at least a few times!  And then there's Butera's  vocal solo ""You're Nobody 'Till Somebody Loves You"" which he hits a homerun with, singing the blues like all get-out! I beleive if you don't know who Sam Butera was, you'll fall in love with him on this DVD.  A note to the wise though.  His solo stuff with the Witnesses on CD doesn't have the same spark as the material with Prima.

After Keely...enter Gia Maione.  As with Keely, they married, (and this time produced Louis, Jr.) but their stage presence and coagulation was joyful and Maione not only had a great voice but was also quite sexy.  A great addition for sure!  Their version of ""Undecided"", trading lyrics back and forth, is priceless as is ""Won't you Come Home (Bill Bailey) Big Daddy"".

There are two versions of Prima's composition ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" (1964 and 1943) each with drummer Jimmy Vincent at the drums.  Both takes are worth watching as this guy could beat the skins like Krupa or Rich.

Ok, now for my second fave on this DVD.  1971's ""As Time Goes By"", most likely from Dinah Shore's variety show.  This proved that Prima could change and keep up with the times.  All solos are great but Butera's and Prima's swing hard and are both ""swingin' in the pocket"".  This is a track, again, worth twice the price of the DVD.  Sadly, the last selection from 1973 is poor quality in both the sound and video departments.  Wish they would have ended with the previous to keep you in that ""good feelin'"" mode.

The extras are worth mentioning.  ""Swing It"" features Mr. Prima singing, playing, AND acting!  It's fun and hokey at the same time.  The sheer excitement and novelty (not to mention the performances) make the poor sound editing worth accepting.  And ""Story 'bout the Dog"" with Sam is, as expected, a classic between two masters.  But a word to the afficianado.  Prima Jr's 2010 version of Jump, Jive 'An Wail"" is...well...just terrible.  Sound and video quality are just a one on a scale to ten.  And it just seems to me that this guy is singing bad and cashing in on his father's name.

In closing, here is my advise to you.  Buy this DVD.  You have to have it in your collection...trust me!  Watch it the first time and just take it all in.  Then watch it the second time and just focus on Louis Prima.  Then watch it a third time and focus on Sam Butera (and the Witnesses).  It will make you want to watch it over and over again.  Trust me on this one!  Enjoy.",1342051200,3,6151,4.504079782411605
4439801,5,B004ODLUDK,"Great DVD with Louis and his band.  It contained many wonderful, fun songs while maintaining a perfect timeline.  I would highly recommend this DVD to any Louis Prima fan.

4439803,5,B004ODLUDK,". . . . except for ""Buona Sera"" out of 28 performances. You got Keely,Sam,Gia and the Witnesses + extra's; There is some early Louis with Peewee Russell  talking to each other through their musical instruments,that is very funny and I think I spotted a young Lucille Ball in the 'Soundie"". The last performance in the Extra's is Louis Jr with his group. I had ""That old Black magic"" from His 1943 gig on an old VHS which I liked a lot and the picture here is much sharper; His gestures/posturing and singing is as hip today as it was then on that feature. Did I hear 'Mangia mi' in one of his songs?  Just a few performances are in color.  61 minutes is the total time on the 28 performances. and around 25 minutes from the Extra's. The first day We got this DVD, it was played twice.",1309305600,7,784,4.248322147651007
4439804,5,B004ODLUDK,"Sure, you can see a lot of Prima videos on YouTube. But this DVD has some gems that you can't: in the early 60's a German producer traveled to the States and filmed live performances of Prima with the Witnesses and Gia Maione, then aired them on German TV. Long missing, feared lost, a clip from the production showed up with Turkish television promos...and the search began! This DVD has several clips from that production, and great stuff from the 50's where most Prima fans seem to fixate. But this DVD is going to open some eyes when folks see how geat Louis was in the 60's and 70's as well. Drop the money on this one--it's worth every penny!",1308960000,11,648,4.408333333333333

8437182,5,B004ODLUDK,"This really is THE must have Louis Prima dvd.
While ""The Wildest"" documentary covers a lot more details from his personal live and information on his raise to fame in general
this dvd serves as a non stop display of many breathtaking taking live and televised recordings from his 50 year musical career.
While admittedly it would be nice for there to be even more shows on the dvd and more videos on the famous Keely Smith and Witnesses years; but you won't find another dvd out there with more raw footage of Louis Prima and his fantastic upbeat and seemingly timeless music",1412726400,,575,4.592233009708738
8437183,3,B004ODLUDK,"Louis Prima was one of New Orleans greatest exports. With a career that spanned 50 years,Prima never lost sight of his roots, while riding the current musical trends of the 30s to the 70s. Prima really hit the big time in the 50s with his revamped  band the Witnesses with legendary sax man Sam Butera and his wife Keely Smith. This was Louis at his height in the business. The 1960s saw Keely and Louis part ways professionally and personally and his new singer became Gia Maione. Gia was a talented and lovely lass who could match Louis on just about every level,like Keely had years before. Her delivery on I Want You to be my Baby was fantastic. But it just wasn't the same and the 60s rolled into the 70s and Louis pressed on,always cutting up on stage and putting on the best show he possibly could for his audiences. With Louis' passing in the late 70s we really lost an original who will never be duplicated or replaced.
This DVD is produced in conjunction with and narrated by Louis Prima Jr.(his mother is Gia).It gives highlights of Louis' career with a large dose of rare footage of Louis through the years and the various incarnations of his bands. And the best part is the videos/songs are in most cases complete,instead of the usually tantalizing but frustrating 10-30 second clips. There are some neat extras here like the 1936 RKO 16 minute short ""Swing It ""with Louis' exceptional band of the time(watch for a young Lucille Ball as Louis' girlfriend),Sing,Sing,Sing from 1943,a coloured clip of ""When you're smiling/The Sheik of Araby""(1959),a clip from an early 60s film  and the ""Story 'bout the Dog"" and finally a rendition of ""Jump,Jive and Wail"" by Louis Prima Jr.and his band.
There are a couple of things I must mention here. The outside jacket says the DVD is two hours long. The main vid on Louis' life is about 1 hour and 2 minutes long. The extras are no longer than 25 minutes. That is barely 1 1/2 hours long. A rather big discrepancy. Secondly near the beginnings of ""The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond"" in the main vid,and ""Swing It""in the extra section,the video becomes blurry for about 3-4 seconds. It seems someone in production didn't catch but SHOULD have caught those glitches and fixed them.
This video skips any hint of Louis' personal life except for the obvious,focusing mainly on the music. That is great,but to get the bigger picture,I would recommend you buy this DVD along with another DVD ""Louis Prima-The Wildest"":together they are the perfect pair to get a better handle on exactly what this swingin' cat was all about.
Louis I love ya and miss you a bunch. But luckily we still have your great musical legacy to lean on and listen to when we need a Prima fix! 3/12- 4 stars.",1412294400,,2723,4.612371134020618

8437185,5,B004ODLUDK,"Seeing Louis the wild man perform in-person is impossible now. This beautifully produced DVD is as close as you are going to get. Any documentary about a performer that entertains and teaches you is a success. That is what documentaries should do. Prima's fourth wife, and greatest partner bar none, gets the footage she deserves. That wife is the First Lady of Las Vegas, Keely Smith. For this fan, she is reason the Smith-Prima act was so incredible. Without Keely, Louis is... a good musician and good entertainer who is essentially a Louis Armstrong mimic.",1375228800,,560,4.905263157894737
