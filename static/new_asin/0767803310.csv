5531,5,0767803310,"Simple summary: conflict is bloody and horrible. Ironically enough, the ones who suffer the most are the ones that try to avoid conflict and live their lives. Occurs in some nameless Central American country. Good to great performances all around.

This movie presents the journey of one Dr. Cifuentes. Dr. Cifuentes is a very professional, knowledgeable  and respected medical practitioner. He recognizes that he is entering the nadir of his career. His wife has recently died and his kids are all grown up and living lives of their own. Time has given Dr. Cifuentes the opportunity to answer some nagging questions. Questions that he wants answered before he passes away. He wants to discover the value, or measure, of his life; his career, his teachings. What legacy has he left? What will he leave behind that's of any value? Now it's time for him to find the truth and the truth is not what he had ever expected.

I loved this movie. I watch it at least twice a year. Sayles is a great director and this is an under appreciated movie. 5/5 stars.",1342569600,,1050,4.695652173913044
5532,3,0767803310,"this film has not the promised subtitles. I saw it years ago with german subtitles and it was an impressive experience, but only with a few lines every 2-4 minutes you cannot follow the movie, only if you are a spanish speaker. I can understand a little spanish, but not enough to relax, and in Austria the understanding of spanish is not that great that you can watch the film with friends.",1295308800,,391,4.444444444444445
5533,5,0767803310,"As the Peruvian's review indicates, there are certainly Latin Americans who don't want to face part of their political reality, just as there are US citizens who like to deny or rationalize the violence of the United States of North America.  The ""Indian Wars"" of the US empire continue as this film on the oppression of Guatemalan Mayan Indians reveals.  While President Clinton did offer a near-apology for our decades of funding and organizing Guatemala's dirty war that killed 200,000 people, our corporatocracy continues to exploit the region and to wage economic warfare via NAFTA, CAFTA and the World Bank.

""Men With Guns"" beautifully shows all who care the sort of brutal madness that has been taking place in Central America.  I've shared this film with Guatemalan immigrants I know, and they confirm the suffering they endured at the hands of our proxy forces.  These US taxpayer funded troops wiped out Guatemalan villages in the same way the Nazis wiped out Russian villages.  It's such a disgrace that it happened, and that so few Americans know about it.  This film offers us a tool to raise awareness, and civic groups like Global Exchange and Madre offer us opportunities to act in solidarity with the victims of US foreign policy.

I'd also recommend books by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Rigoberta Menchu (who, predictably, had a Yale professor conduct a campaign to cast doubt on her credibility - a standard psy-op tactic of our military establishment) and the DVD documentary, ""When the Mountains Tremble.""

Also see ""Guatemala: Never Again!"", the official report of the human rights office of the archdiocese of Guatemala.  Sadly, Bishop Juan Girardi was murdered a couple days after turning in that report.",1156032000,9,1726,5.067137809187279

5535,4,0767803310,"When a civl war rages through a country, the line between the good guys and the bad ones is blurred.  Such is the case in Men with Guns.  Both sides in conflict abuse others, even the innocent ones, to secure their goals.",1142121600,,221,4.238095238095238
5536,5,0767803310,"The basis of the movie was taken from a secondary character in Francisco Goldman's book ""The Long Night of White Chickens"", which is about Guatemala during the civil war, also the cover photo is the work of a Guatemalan photographer, Palma. Excellent movie.",1108944000,6,257,5.0
5537,4,0767803310,"Federico Luppi, the fine actor from Argentina, takes the lead role as Dr. Fuentes.  He sets out to find his former students on the road to places he's never been. The shift in his life is caused by the death of his wife. He sets out in spite of his family not wanting him to leave. The aging doctor first encounters one his former students, now a drug dealer, using the same drugs he taught him to cure others, he is now using them for ill purposes. His journey has only begun and he finds many more dissapointments along the way. This is a beautiful film that is allegorical, historical, contemporary  and packed with messages for the viewer to interpret. In his quest to find his students he finds his country to be quite different from the view he had of it prior to his leaving the city. He encounters missing people  and tales of abductions from men with guns. The villagers call them white men with guns but are quick to say that the Indios are also now white men. Although the story takes place in an unnamed country, the parallels to Guatemala are clear. Having witnessed a corpse on the roadside while travelling in a bus (everyone gawked with little concern, as though it were a common sight) in Guatemala and seeing the treatment first hand of the military I am pretty sure this is where it is. However, this is unimportant as these occurences of hit squads and paramilitary goons, in cahoots with the military, are a frequent sight in many Latin American countries. Anyway, Dr. Fuentes picks up several people along the way to expand the tale. He picks up a ""liberation priest"" who abandons his collar and those who believed in him, a former military thug turned thief, an indigenous young woman who doesn't speak since she was raped by soldiers and a street-savy kid who is an orphan and Dr. Fuentes's guide. All represent the society Dr. Fuentes is unaware of and  as they tell their sordid stories, amidst flashbacks  and surreal dreams, a country whose people live in brutal chaos is revealed . This is a powerful movie, one to be seen more than once in order to fully enjoy. Although the story evolves around Dr. Fuentes and his crew,  there are several encounters with a funny couple who are ""informed"" tourists with bad Spanish accents  and worse pronunciation. A completly enthralling film, in spite of its length, that hits close to the harsh reality of life in Latin America. A beautiful film  that is set to the backdrops of the jungle and it's  relics from the past, as well as present day village life , it is a movie that is visually breathtaking and mentally stimulating. Recommended for those that like movies that carry a political and social commentary. Great stuff, see it before your next vacation to the tropics, so that as the guy from the radio says""and now you know the rest of the story"" before you get there.",1046736000,18,2846,4.575638506876228
5538,5,0767803310,"The main charachter is approaching his retirement. As for his last vacation, he decides to check up on his students. Students that he trained to help the poorer people of his country. However, he soon discovers that something is wrong. His students are missing, and the only explanation he can gather about them is that somehow ""Men with Guns"" were involved. What starts as a vacation soon turns into a quest. Soon more charachters join him, including an orphan boy, an awol solidier, an ex-priest (my favorite) and a mute woman. All of which leads to the ending. No hollywood fairytales here. Just a solid story, and a solid cast. Part thriller, part drama, this is a truly great film.",1029196800,4,686,4.725
5539,5,0767803310,"This is a great film.  Don't be deceived by the title, it is not a violent film, though it is about violence.
There seems to be a debate here about where the movie takes place, whether Mexico, Guatamala, or somewhere in South America.  According to John Sayles, the answer is all of the above.  Though it was filmed in Mexico, Sayles purposely set it in an unnamed country to illustrate that, at least in one sense, the various conflicts in latin american countries are essentially the same--one group of ""men with guns"" supposily is fighting with another group of ""men with guns,"" but really all both groups are doing is terrorizing the local people who live there.  To the villagers, it doesn't matter which group is the government and which are the rebels, or which ideology each group claims to be fighting for.  This general point could apply equally to many countries in latin america who have had rebel movements over the past 20 years (this includes Guatamala, but also Columbia, Peru, El Salvador, and unfortunately several others).  While people familiar with Central America will recognize that the villagers wear Mayan dress, that is more due to where the movie was filmed than an intent to set it in a particular country.  The soundtrack is comprised of music from almost every latin american country, from Argentina to Mexico, and Sayles says in the liner notes that he did this to emphasize that the film is not about any particular place, but rather what those conflicts have in common and why they remain so intractable.",1024704000,22,1537,4.799242424242424
5540,5,0767803310,"Ok, after reading all the reviews, I feel a bit of an obligation to correct some of the entries, especially since the ""most helpful"" one is blatantly wrong on this respect.  The movie, it is generally agreed, takes place in Guatemala.  this is not specified, though, but it is evident throughout the movie that this is where it is happening.  So don't believe that it was in south america, or mexico, or anything like that (though it was filmed in Mexico).  How many mayans are there in South America?  So I hope that this entry helps.  And its not my opinion, but the opinion of my college professor.
Oh yeah, and its an AWESOME movie.",1019692800,4,636,4.48695652173913
5541,5,0767803310,"This movie is obviously about Guatemala. The opening sequence shows a Mayan woman and her child in traditional dress. However bad things got in Mexico, they were not as bad as this. The events described and particular horror of the place closely follow the counter insurgency campaign in the Guatemalan highlands where the guerrillas were largely  annihilated as a military force. However the oppression of the Indians continues and the underlying political issues were never resolved, hence the feeling at the end of being left hanging. The film pulls the viewer into the abiguity and heartbreak  of a situation where the Indians were caught between both sides and paid the price.
It is a unique film and one has to respect Sayles' courage and insight in making it, and choosing to do so in Spanish.
Unfortunately that assured that much the audience in the US would not see it but Sayles has never seemed to worry much about commercial success.",1007510400,6,945,4.9
5542,5,0767803310,"This movie grapples with some serious issues.  What, exactly is going on politically in South America?  Where does individual responsibility lie? What does helping people really mean?  What kind of legacy is it possible to leave?  The setting of this movie is an unnamed country in South America. The writer/director, John Sayles, did this on purpose.  This is to show that the kind of thing depicted in the movie could happen anywhere.  However, it was shot in Mexico, in Spanish, with English subtitles.
The movie starts Federico Luppi as Dr. Humberto Fuentes, a wealthy doctor who is approaching retirement and has never paid close attention to the realities of his country.  His greatest achievement, the ""legacy"" he is leaving, is his participation in an international health program in which he trained young doctors to work in the poorest of villages.
I watched this movie with horror and then, finally, resignation, as Dr. Fuentes travels in the mountains and makes startling discoveries.  I made a few startling discoveries myself -- the abject poverty of the people, the disregard for human life, the acceptance by the people of this as a way of life.  He finds that the people have no food.  He finds that both the army and the guerillas are equally brutal.  The movie takes us all on a journey with Dr. Fuentes.  Along the way we meet a homeless child, a priest who lives with his own private demons, and a deserter from the army with a history of participating in the carnage.  The movie goes deeper and deeper into the despair and devastation.
This is not a comfortable video to watch as it brings the viewer not only into the realities of the political systems in South America, but to the basic question of individual responsibility.  I recommend it for those who are willing to take a fresh look at these things.  You will not be smilling after viewing this video.  But you will be thinking.",975110400,39,1908,4.771341463414634
5543,5,0767803310,"This is a wonderful movie.  A beautiful story is interwoven with complex  ideas about religion, death, politics, and ""might makes right""  philosophy.
I just want to point out that contrary to what a few  reviewers said, this movie clearly did not take place in Mexico.  Doctor  Fuentes specifically says, in one scene, that Mexico is North of where they  are.  What country it takes place in is not possible to determine, and this  seems deliberate to me.",965260800,8,455,4.805194805194805
5544,5,0767803310,"Those at a certain station in life will identify strongly with Dr. Fuentes, the main character in John Sayles' deeply insightful ""Men with Guns."" Aware that he's facing a terminal illness, Fuentes seeks  to leave behind a legacy in the way in which he trains others to use their  own gifts. He realizes this is the most effective way to pass on the  knowledge and awareness that he's achieved during his life.
That's why  I'm not comfortable when other reviewers have said he's ""naive.""  Yes, he's uninformed about his country's politics, perhaps intentionally  so. But he's also the only character in the film who treats all others with  respect and is able to interact with them all. And, without giving anything  away, note that Fuentes succeeds.
This is a deeply thoughtful, almost  spiritual film, and I have great respect for John Sayles for writing,  directing, and producing it.",958435200,25,886,4.925675675675675
5545,5,0767803310,"This movie is truly fantastic. The story is somewhat depressing but it also leaves a feeling of hope. It's dramatic, suspenseful, funny and sad but wholly engrossing.
The cinematography is wonderful. The writing,  casting, acting, locations and music are all superb. Even though the film  contains many 'flashback' sequences those parts are easily distinguished  from the 'present'.
Also, don't let the fact that it's (mostly) subtitled  put you off - you probably won't realise you're reading, after a  while!
Altogether, a wonderful film that would be enjoyed by anyone -  whether living close to Latin America or half a world away.",930873600,9,634,5.227722772277228

7788723,5,0767803310,"I just want to let people know that this  movie is clearly, on some level, a retelling of Dante's Inferno.  This is not my insight; it is that of a colleague from several years ago.  But it is clearly true.  Like the Inferno, it tells the story of a man, dedicated to reason and science, who journeys into hell.  There is even a glimpse of heaven and the beatific vision, at the end. People who are interested in Dante or who teach Dante might find this movie of interest.",1517097600,,472,4.258426966292135

I do not know what makes this movie so incredibly powerful. I think it is because it is about any country and about any good man who comes to realize what evil (military) has taken control of his country. I also think John Sayles worked his magic in sending a very profound  message. I am not sure if I am going to use this next yr. as it is SO powerful. I have  to watch it again.

- This is a very unique way of presenting the issues of Latin America.
