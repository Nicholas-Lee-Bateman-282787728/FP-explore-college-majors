The translations were superior compared to other companies. I was reluctant to order this drama from PMP but I'm happy to say that the English translations are great. Aside from the subtitles, Soo Ae is my favorite Korean actress and she is just wonderful in this drama. What a talent!",1398384000,,411,4.722222222222222
8604779,4,B00EEIHA5C,"This an absorbing, fast-paced but ultimately exhausting drama.  The cat and mouse game between the two main characters, former lovers now locked in a determination to destroy each other, is fascinating at first.  After a while, though, it becomes a bit one-note with over the top melodrama, repetitive scenes and too many unsympathetic characters.  In some ways it began to remind me of the high camp of US television series like Dallas and Dynasty with their larger than life villains.  Still, the performances are excellent, and it is certainly never boring -- just ultimately a bit pointless.  Recommended for being addictive viewing, but it will leave you kind of empty in the end.",1395964800,2,685,5.0265486725663715
