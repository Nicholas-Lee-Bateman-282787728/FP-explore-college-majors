8764768,4,B01H5BOHXW,"I find the only existing review of this disc to be overly hostile, so I'm adapting a review I posted on my website. (Google my name if you want to visit the site, and see more of my Shakespeare reviews.) I live just outside of Stratford-upon-Avon, and go to Royal Shakespeare Company productions regularly. This review was from the press night (opening night) performance.

From the first scene with Rodrigo and Iago taunting Brabantio about his daughter, Desdemona, having married Othello, it was clear that this was an inventive production. There was a sort of canal running through the middle of the stage, and Rodrigo and Iago were standing up in a small gondola. (That water, which would be covered at times by metal grilles with arabesque designs, was repeatedly used in the play.) The rest of the stage featured a slightly broken Gothic arch at the back, representing part of a church, and terraces on either side.

Yet this was a resolutely modern version of Othello. The soldiers are all dressed in modern uniforms, with contemporary weapons. Laptops are seen at times, along with electronic communication equipment. In one poorly considered bit, in the council-chamber scene when all the officers are discussing the military situation, a huge TV screen came down over the stage so one character could report on troop movements. That scene seemed to set a more modern tone than the rest of the play; it is, in fact, the only scene like that, because the play then moves to Cyprus, in a more military environment, where most of the scenery is ammunition crates, oil drums, and weapons.

One of the main talking points of this play is the fact that the RSC cast a black actor, Lucian Msamati, as Iago, which changes the balance of race, one of the main themes of the play. After I few minutes, I forgot all about this, except for the few lines where Othellos blackness is mentioned. To me, they were all just characters in a play, and the lack of the black-white theme made no difference. (In fact, many of the other soldiers were non-white as well, further erasing that dichotomy.)

Opposite Hugh Quarshie as Othello, Msamati was astounding. He managed to perfectly portray the truculence of Iago, and the complexity of his character. From beginning to the final shot, before the house lights went off, where Iago shakes his head, saying that he will not talk, Msamati was the driving force in this production.

Its not that Hugh Quarshie wasn't good in his role, but, at times, I felt he didn't go far enough. Through most of the play, Quarshie seemed to inhabit Othello fully, but in the final half hour  when he plans to kill Desdemona, kills her, and then regrets what he did  I found him flat and emotionless. Othello should show anger then remorse, and Quarshie remained strangely distant during those final scenes. This was clearly a choice made by director Iqbal Khan, but I don't think it worked.

Joanna Vanderham was very good as Desdemona, but she often seemed to be playing to the audience, rather than to the actors. She had some excellent scenes, and some where she didn't seem to be fully in her role. And her singing of the Willow song was a bit off-key.

There are a number of scenes with many characters in Othello, notably the one where Cassio  well portrayed by Jacob Fortune-Lloyd  gets drunk, and feels that his reputation is damaged by his escapades. This production had that scene become a sort of freestyle-rap battle between Cassio and Iago, which seemed to be a trivial way to approach it. But the play worked best in the scenes with just two or three characters, where there was much more dramatic tension.

Many of the supporting actors were excellent, notably Ayesha Dharker as Emilia, whose acting in the final scenes was top-notch, and Scarlett Brookes as Bianca.

The overall staging  aside from the dancing and the TV screen  was excellent, and the lighting very inventive; this was one of the more complex sets Ive seen at the RSC. I was also sitting in the upper circle, which gave me a very different view of the stage from the stalls, where I usually set. (It just goes to show that the best seats don't always let you see everything.) This highly visual production will definitely work well on screen; it is to be filmed and broadcast to cinemas on August 26.

The play was long, and felt long. At 2:55, I felt it could have been trimmed a bit. The first part seemed a lot longer than the second, and the last long scene, in Desdemonas bedchamber (her bed was at the front of the stage), seemed poorly paced.

Im probably being more critical than I should. I was feeling a bit tired last night, and it took me a while to get into the play. But things felt a bit rickety, unpolished. Actors made a few small flubs, and the timing didn't always seem right. I have a feeling that Ill like this play a lot more when I see it again in two weeks, when the actors have had more time to become comfortable with it.

I would really have liked to see Othello express a bit more emotion; in the end, if you look at this play as a battle between Iago and Othello, Iago clearly won in this version. As much as Lucian Msamati played a subtly nuanced Iago, Hugh Quarshies Othello felt a bit too shallow. This was a very good production, but it could have been better.",1476748800,11,5300,4.602332979851537
8764769,2,B01H5BOHXW,"Hugh Quarshie, the actor who plays Othello in this RSC production, wrote: I am not convinced that Shakespeare is an unequivocally reliable guide in the exploration of human nature; and I fear that we may see the world and ourselves through the distorting prism of his plays. (Playing Othello, published on the British Library website, July 19, 2016).
Let me comment on Hugh Quarshies statement by summarizing the play and then reviewing the RSCs production of Othello.
Othello is one of Shakespeares most difficult plays. No Shakespearean scholar, literary critic, theatre nor movie director has yet been able to grasp its meaning. Othello is one of Shakespeares wisest characters. In this sense, he is unique. Shakespeare emphasizes Othellos uniqueness by presenting him as a black man among white Venetians. Othello is charged with an incredibly difficult task. His task is to take Desdemona from Venice via Cyprus to Mauritania. According to Shakespeares symbolic illustration, each of these three places represents a specific state of the human mind. Venice illustrates an ordinary, i.e., unrefined state of the mind; Cyprus is a more advanced state; Mauritania is the highest state that is available to man (Mauritania is Othellos home-country; it is in this sense that he is from men of royal siege). Shakespeare emphasizes the progression between these states by having three different time zones operating simultaneously. The events taking place in Venice are measured by months (till now some nine moons wasted); the events occurring in Cyprus are measured by days (what, keep a week away? seven days and nights?) For those who are in Cyprus at the time of the festivities and are members of Othellos immediate entourage, their time is measured by hours (from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven). Shakespeare dedicated the entire Scene II.2 to indicate the period of compressed time.
The play is built around a technical term one has to die before dying, which means that in order to reach the highest state of the mind, one has to free himself from worldly attachments. This is the experience that Desdemona has to go through before she may reach Mauritania. (Friar Francis in Much Ado About Nothing refers to this experience as Come, lady, die to live; Friar Lawrence in Romeo and Juliet describes it as Shes not well married that lives married long; but shes best married that dies married young; Viola in Twelfth Night expresses her readiness for this experience when she states I, most jocund, apt and willingly, to do you rest, a thousand deaths would die; Miranda in The Tempest calls it fair play; for Hamlet, Mauritania remains the undiscoverd country). In other words, the entire play is an allegorical illustration of experiences associated with the development of higher states of the human mind.
The play illustrates the challenges that Desdemona is faced with when Othello guides her through this very difficult experience. Desdemona may seem to be totally devoted to Othello. Yet, she is somewhat disloyal. Foolishly, she tries to interfere with Othellos grooming of Cassio for his future role as deputy governor of Cyprus. It is in this sense that Desdemona has allowed Cassio to use her unlawfully. (Even though Othello demoted Cassio, it was Othello who requested in a letter sent from Cyprus to the Venetian Senate that Cassio be made deputy - Scene III.2).
Othello adapts his approach in such a way that he employs Iago to create situations that are part of his plan. Iago is a clever villain, but he is no match for Othello. Iago is so full of himself and so engaged in his scheming that he does not register what Othello is really doing. This is a typical Shakespeares trap used so masterly to point out our flawed reactive patterns, i.e., reactions which block the operation of more subtle layers of perception. The audience watching the play goes through a test. If the audience allows themselves to be driven by their cruder emotional and intellectual reactions, they will not be able to recognize Othellos function and understand his actions. In such a case, Iago will be able to lead them tenderly ... by the nose as asses are.
Othellos handkerchief spotted with strawberries symbolically represents an instrument of protection. At the beginning of the play, Desdemona is the holder of the handkerchief. At one point Othello decides to transfer the handkerchief to Cassio. After Desdemonas departure from Cyprus, Cassio will need the handkerchief to protect him, especially against Roderigos attempt to murder him. Othello has to arrange the transfer in such a way that it will be completely transparent to Cassio and Desdemona. Iago, who is driven by an entirely different motivation, helps Othello to execute this task by placing the handkerchief in Cassios lodging.
Desdemona is able to perceive the true nature of Othellos actions only after she dies before dying. It is then that dead Desdemona asks Emilia to commend me to my kind lord.
In his final words, Othello gives the audience another hint to help them understand his actions. He tells the audience that he has freed himself from any traces of jealousy and other egotistic tendencies. Othello refers to such tendencies as a malignant and a turband Turk whom he smote in Aleppo. This took place many years before Othellos arrival in Venice. Afterwards, Othello departs and follows Desdemona to Mauritania (For, in my sense, tis happiness to die). Their experiences were needed to prepare Venice for the next stage of the developmental process. After their arrival in Mauritania, the music that may not be heard becomes perceptible in Venice. A sequel to Othello is illustrated in The Merchant of Venice. It is there that Portia, just like Othello did with the Turkish fleet, will be able to destroy, and then recover, Antonios ships.
Lets now take a look at how Othellos story was presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company. Presenting Iago as a black man has definitively excited the critics. Playing up the blackness of Iago, however, has drastically diluted the uniqueness of Othello and made it much more difficult for the audience to grasp the meaning of the play. Secondly, by attempting to degrade Othellos nobility, the director of this RSC production has seriously altered the original play. Othello does not have to torture Iago to get out his testimony. It is the other way around; in the Temptation scene (Scene III.3), it is Othello who provides cues for Iagos narrative about Desdemonas supposed infidelity.
Finally, the removal of the scenes with the Clown robbed the audience from fully experiencing the play. Shakespeare used the Clown to indicate that the inner structure of the play goes beyond the boundaries of rational psychology. In his encounter with Cassio, the Clown advises Cassio that he should not use intermediaries in his attempt to communicate with Othello; instead he should follow the music that may not be heard. But Cassio is still incapable of perceiving such music. Later on, the Clown warns Desdemona about her misunderstanding of Othello (Hes a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies, is stabbing). Desdemona, however, is too preoccupied with Cassio to pay attention to the Clown and his messages.
As I have indicated in the review of The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeares music that may not be heard tends to play tricks on the directors who are insensitive to the subtle layers of the plays. So it is with this RSCs production. By trying to dilute Othellos uniqueness, the director has unintentionally created a black man bona fide villain in the play. To escape from this unwelcoming situation, the director had to coat Iago with some more sympathetic features. Namely, Iago becomes gradually wracked with guilt over the crimes he commits. At one point he mimics Lady Macbeths behaviour when he obsessively washes off imaginary bloodstains from the floor. The play ends up with an invented scene in which Iago tries to laugh, but his laughter is somewhat choked. In this RSCs production, Iago is no longer Iago; he has accidentally and prematurely been transformed into Little Iago. But this transformation could not have happened in Othello. In accordance with Shakespeares sequel, this transformation takes place over the course of several plays. Little Iago, i.e., Iachimo, is another Italian villain. He appears in Cymbeline.
In conclusion, I would like to pass to Hugh Quarshie the following advice. Forget about Jonson, Bloom, and Show. They are pretty much clueless about Shakespeare. Instead, for a starter, read the chapter on Othello in Wes Jamrozs Shakespeares Elephant in Darkest England. Then take on Greg Dorans offer to direct another production of Othello. You do not have to go tilting at the windmills of traditional interpretation. Just stay with the original text and make sure to cast the same actor to play the Clown and Othello. In this way thousands of spectators will greatly benefit from Shakespeares knowledge of human nature.",1474848000,7,9019,5.049631120053656
