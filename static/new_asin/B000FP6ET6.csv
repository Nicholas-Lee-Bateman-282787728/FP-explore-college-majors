8125291,4,B000FP6ET6,"Thanks to an internet download, I saw able to see this VHS tape of the second annual Great American Bash tour which was hosted by Tony Schavonie & David Crockett who gave the introductions & showed some background footage leading into each match.

Matches Include:
Hair Match: Jimmy valant vs. Shaska Whatley - Shaska attacked Valant as he got into the ring & kept beating on his head with repeated punches & headbutts until he was bleeding while Paul Jones had no issues getting his shots in from the outside before Valant was able to start gaining offense leading to allies of both men appearing making their presence known.  This was a pretty basic match with an entertaining aftermath.
As a side note, they showed the finish & aftermath of Hair Match between Valant & Paul Jones after this match.

Taped Fist Match: Ronnie Garvin vs. Tully Blanchard - This was a non-title match held under boxing rules of 10 3 minute rounds with a 30 second rest period between rounds with Wahoo McDaniels & J.J. Dillion in their respective corners as this match started out with a bang literally with one man getting knocked out before the match started as this was a one sided dominate performance for the first few rounds with one man being so ""punch drunk"" that he wasn't connecting any punches at all against his opponent but almost hit the referee a few times & even bleeding from his head before finally able to mount some offense busting his opponent open as well as this was limited with the match stipulations but definitely physical with some entertaining moments.

Chain Match: Road Warriors vs. Ivan & Nikita Koloff - This was held under tornado tag rules with all four men legal as this was a physical brawl from the start with each team double teaming & delivering big blows against each other using the chain heavily to their advantage with chokes & whips along with making their strikes more impactful to the point where one man was bleeding from the forehead as the referee kept getting caught up in the action on more than one occasion as this was just a very physical fight that couldn't be contained in the confines of a scheduled match.

NWA Tag Team Champions Rock N' Roll Express vs. Arn & Ole Anderson - Not only did Arn Anderson come into this match also being the World Television Champion but the Andersons were also involved in the attack that broke Ricky Morton's nose weeks earlier. The Andersons attempted to maneuver the Express into their corner only for them to quickly escape each time & taking control with double dropkicks while also Ricky got revenge for the Andersons breaking his nose before the Andersons were finally able trap & singled out one member of the team heavily working him over in their corner singling out body parts while also taking advantage of the referee to break the rules whenever possible in what resulted as a good match between two evenly matched teams.

Magnum T.A. vs. Nikita Koloff - This was the forth match in their Best Of Seven series with Nikita ahead 3-0 meaning that Magnum was in a no lose situation as both men went back & forth trading momentum throughout the first half of the match with neither man gaining a series of momentum with Ivan Koloff getting involved on the outside as well whenever possible as this just came down to one man being able to catch the other by surprise for the win as this was an average match that never left first gear.

Steel Cage Match: America's Team (Dusty Rhodes & Magnum T.A.) & Baby Doll vs. Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton & Dennis Condrey) & Jim Cornette - Cornette's bodyguard Big Bubba was on the outside of the cage with Baby Doll getting the first offensive move in the match that caused Cornette to attempt to climb out of the cage for safety with one man fighting off both members of the Express with Cornette getting his shots whenever possible only to keep running whenever Baby Doll got close to him with the numbers game eventually catching up to the point where he was bleeding from the cage & attacks coming off the top of the cage before things eventually broke down with not only Baby Doll finally getting her hands on Cornette but who was left laying after the match.

Steel Cage Match: NWA Champion Ric Flair vs. Dusty Rhodes - Both men attempted to play mind games with each other through trying to show the other man up before Dusty was able to keep staying one step ahead of Flair working him over & keeping him down before Flair was able to get the advantage heavily working over Dusty's leg & previously injured ankle as both men traded momentum using the cage various times resulting in both men heavily bleeding & constantly attacking the cut.

This was a nice 2 hour tape showing a collection of the complete matches showing most of the big attraction matches from the Bash that year.  They only downfall of this tape today is that most of the marquee matches on this tape have been released onto DVD so it's not worth going out of your way to buy unless your a collector but it's worth a viewing if your able to find a copy.",1416355200,,5328,4.610759493670886

The show is not the greatest.  Typical Dusty finishes and whatnot.  I got it for the Midnight Express/Jim Cornette vs. Rhodes/Magnum/Baby Doll.  It's even funnier in the rearview mirror.",1200182400,,303,4.882352941176471
