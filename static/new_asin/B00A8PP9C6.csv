What I think it lacks is reference that humans are discovering the benefits of moving into the heart centre or a ""liberation of the heart.""

Could it be possible that there might be a relationship between behaviour towards ""mother earth"" and one's unconscious feelings towards one's actual mother?  I imagine that from a newborn's point of view, mother is their earth to them with holding and feeding as their needed resources.  When trauma occurs during that time, deeply hurt feelings go underground and perhaps resurfaces and gets acted out onto ""mother earth"" in one form or another.  I once heard a speaker ask her audience what they thought might happen if reference to the ecosystem were changed from mother earth to father planet.  Since we expect mother, and by extension mother earth, to give and give, she wonders if we might become more respectful to the environment or relate to the environment in a different way, if we allowed ourselves to associate it with father/father planet.  Alice Miller said something to the effect that ""not all momma's boys are greedy but all greedy men are momma's boys.""

I wonder if another piece of the puzzle is the phenomenon some call ""identification with the aggressor.""  If a parent unintentionally abuses a child, the child may then identify with the parent and then abuse the environment when they grow up as a way to communicate what happened to them.  Since abuse causes the ebb and flow of feelings in the body to become repressed, and since feelings are the bridge between head and body, the child might grow up not knowing what they feel from the neck down and will thus live more from the head than from the heart in partnership with the head.  So if trees and wildlife are the earth's feelings and if a person experienced traumatized feelings, the theory is that they will traumatize the feelings of the earth.  It may seem simplistic but isn't it more likely that a person will relate to the environment in a different way if they feel calm and at peace within (ie: downgraded the status of their mother from ""all good"" to just a regular woman?)

Although this film isn't overly graphic and has its odd moment, I think it could have been more interesting had it included more understanding to why humans do what they do.",1381536000,,2441,4.726415094339623
