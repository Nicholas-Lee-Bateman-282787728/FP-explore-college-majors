6567429,5,B00MBI0B0I,"This is a film that the Warrenites are going to hate. Proof of altered documents,fake backyard photos,evidence manipulated to frame
LHO and much more. You can see many examples of documents changed to make sure that the patsy takes the blame,these altered
by the FBI...what a surprise. Very revealing are Johnson's plan to escalate the Vietnam War the day before JFK was assassinated and
Ford wanting to change evidence to be published by the Warren Comm. Backyard photos of LHO clearly a composite,FBI fingerprint
LHO while dead...anything suspicious about that?
There are so many things that the Warrenites are going to struggle to debunk in this video that almost guarantees it will not be shown
on mainstream tv..I hope that proves to be wrong.",1414195200,30,748,5.040322580645161
6567430,1,B00MBI0B0I,"Forget single shooter, magic bullet, or military-industrial complex conspiracies, this is just an all around terrible documentary film.

Jim Marrs, the narrator, is monotone and spends the entire film droning endlessly. This monotony is never broken since he is the only talking head featured in the entire film. The movie is a mix of photographs (Ken Burns style) laid over video of Marrs droning on in the same spot from his desk for the entire film. There is no separate narration track versus talking head track, but just Marrs sitting at the desk talking and talking and talking.  He also mispronounces the word irrelevant as ""irrevelant,"" (7:40) which shows how little time care was put into editing the narrative of the film.",1502928000,,732,4.991803278688525

members should all be erased from history. Our homegrown terrorists. And those who colluded or never spoke up. From JFK to every hush murder to everyone lost in VN war to our national debt. The damage to our heritage can hardly be restored. We suffer now from all the evil these horrid govt officials have done. The Oswalds are owed a resounding apology. All the suffering that ensued. Breathtaking. Jim Marrs' straightforward narration makes it simple for any listener to grasp. While a bit fast-paced, the top 3 docus on this subject are shown at hi-speed. Too much material, limited video space. Who transcribes these closed captions? Words/names are wrong, misspelled. Mess! If I were deaf, I'd be insulted.",1502582400,5,751,4.968253968253968

He was firm when it came to letting the world know he wouldn't tolerate threats and bullying and yet he strenuously strove for peace. It's too bad that L.B. Johnson and the Joint Chiefs aren't alive to be convicted of treason. Johnson and cronies wanted war with Viet Nam. Our poor boys.

The very fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was later murdered by a man who had only a few months to live was enough to say:  ""Hey, what's up with this?""  I think behind the scenes politics is a very dirty business and the common man or woman, or the POTUS who wants to do right by the common man or woman, does not stand a chance.  Politicians with the right influence and money can do about anything they want and have it covered up. Look at the Clintons.

6567471,5,B00MBI0B0I,"A few important facts were left out of this excellent documentary, such as: Vice President Johnson ducking below his seat almost a minute before President Kennedy was shot. Also the fact that Vice President Johnson telling his secretary a day before the assassination that he would not have the Kennedy's' to worry about very soon...Also, Jacklin Kennedy saying that it was Vice President that had Jack killed. Johnson knew he would not be the choice of President Kennedy as Vice President in the next election and that President Kennedy was going to investigate Johnson's corruption when he was a senator in Texas because of what Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes had said about Johnson when they were dealing with him.....Oswald was actually working for Bobby Kennedy who wanted to know about what the Mafia was up to in New Orleans. They found out about Oswald and had him framed, along with people in the government, with Kennedy's murder. Another fact about Oswald was that he was an intelligence officer while in the marines and had studied Russian so as to be able to tell the Russians on how to shoot down Gary Powers U2 plane in order to disrupt the Salt talks when Oswald defected to Russia. Another very important fact was when Oswald returned to America he was met by a man named, George de Mohrenschildt, who was the brother in law of Zapruder who filmed the assassination.....That film was doctored and did not show Kennedy's car coming to a complete stop before the assassination, or the fact that Kennedy's car escort had been waved off and left Kennedy's car to travel by itself as it entered the plaza.  The real assassin was Vice President Johnson's hit man who he used while a senator in Texas. This man was actually tried for murder and was let off by Johnson while Johnson was a senator...It is said that Johnson had his own sister killed because she was dating this man and Johnson feared she may have known what people he had murdered....The book: ""Dr. Mary's Monkey,""  has the rest of the facts about Oswald that were not in this film.",1470787200,4,2058,4.698060941828255

I thought the author (and narrator, Mr. Marrs himself) presented a pretty well-documented argument for his beliefs.  I'll give him credit for not coming across like a nut-job disguised as an alleged expert.  And I appreciate the detail he's gone into assembling his research, even if I'm not convinced by some of his conclusions such as suggesting Oswald had a doppelganger who did the deed and Oswald himself was the patsy, the one blamed, in order to cover up a coup at the very highest levels of government.  Or suggesting the 2nd shooter on the grassy knoll was either a Dallas cop or a sniper dressed in a Dallas police uniform.  Mr. Marr's enhanced photo 'evidence' stretches the limits of believability and his conclusions as to the identities of some of the plaza witnesses seems just idle speculation with no proof to back up his conclusions.

In the photo it is completely impossible to determine what it is a photo of.  Was there a consipracy?  Was there more than one gunman?

The trajectory of that bullet could NOT have caused that injury because the angle seems wrong...would it not also injured Jacky as well, given the apparent trajectory, to the right of the skull as opposed to the front. And, also, is it possible that the final shot came, not from the knoll, but the front, as in the overpass? What about the two drains on the right side of the road...someone mentioned that perhaps the final killing shot came from the drain and not the fence area. I am just wondering, and asking, why did not Jim Marrs address that possibility?

6567524,5,B00MBI0B0I,"In this DVD JFK assassination expert Jim Marrs presents what he thinks are some of the most blatant problems with the official version of the JFK assassination.

For people who haven't looked into all this the governments official story, the Warren Commission Report, is a joke. It was never a serious investigation.

What's puzzling is after 50 years even though this is obvious for anyone who looks into it nobody has ever done anything about it and they probably never will.

This DVD has the same name as a book Jim Marr's wrote about the assassination. The book goes into many, many more details.

I am completely convinced that Australian undercover detective Colin Mclaren is correct in his book ""The Smoking Gun"".  After some exhaustive personal on-site research and interviews, along with a picture I had never seen before Mclaren says that Oswald only fired two shots.  The third casing over near the closed windows was a plug to keep out dirt and had to be ejected before Oswald could fire the live steel-jacketed rounds.  One hit the curbing near the motorcade and caused a piece of the curb to hit Kennedy but not penetrate and caused Kennedy to yell ""I'm hit"".  The second hit Kennedy and subsequently Connelly.  Connelly and his wife were sitting in jump seats which were inboard and down from the Kennedys, allowing an alignment with the bullet.  The third and fatal shot was from an explosive round and was fired completely by accident by Secret Service Agent George Hickey in the car behind the Kennedys.  There is a great photograph I had never seen that show Hickey standing up in the back of the car looking back towards where the shots came from and holding an AR-15 with explosive rounds pointed at Kennedy..",1438300800,,1253,4.689497716894977

If you still believe Oswald killed JFK, then (like Marrs points out), you have to believe that a bullet can make a 90degree turn in mid-air.  Marrs does a good job of proving his objective -- there was a coverup. So now the question is why?  Having read multiple books on this assassination, I have little doubt that the mob actually worked on the logistics of the murder -- but there was no doubt that there was complicity at many senior levels. For those that want to read a serious researcher who has put it all together, read the book by Lamar Waldron.  And if you care to understand the mob angle, google the term ""CAMTEX"" and you will learn the feds have had a taped confession for many years.",1426896000,2,817,4.397350993377484

Watching this video, one gets the idea that Jim was sitting around his study and thought: hey, I'll set up a camera and throw together an hour-long video rehashing a few bits of info from my book and show a series of tired of old photos that everyone and his uncle has seen.

6567581,5,B00MBI0B0I,"Jim Marrs is a native Texan and credible journalist who interviewed many of the players.  He is a very reliable researcher and actually leaves out some of the most fantastic (but true) details such as the fact that the Zapruder film (and Nix and Muchmore) were edited and modified on the night of the assassination, the body of JFK was not in the coffin seen on TV being placed into the hearse, and Marina Oswald  was kept under house arrest for the entire Warren Commission, the autopsy doctors smashed his skull before the autopsy began and  wheeled another brain into the morgue as a ""stillborn"" baby (a news photographer captured the event!).

When you realize Jim Marrs knows all this and leaves it out, this little video is positively conservative and to those who know all the facts, it is almost boring.

The reviews that mock and ridicule just need to provide answers to the questions and their position will be fully accepted.

Who were the Secret Service men with valid looking identification?  Why didn't Oswald have a single box of ammo or even one cartridge anywhere?  Why did police chief Curry say until the day he died, ""The problem is no one can place Oswald on the sixth floor with the gun."" Why did the Lyndon Johnson duck before the first shot was fired? Why was French assassin Michael Mertz deported to Canada from Dallas on the afternoon of the assassination?  Why was Los Angelos hit man Jim Braden in the Dal-Tex building?  Why was an Oswald look alike seen handcuffed being taken out of the Texas Theater  by police 20 minutes after Oswald was arrested and taken out the front door? Why was Jack Ruby allowed into the police station parking garage?  Why did Lt. Day keep the fact that he had ""lifted"" a big, juicy perfect palm print all to himself for days?

And where is the source for all the assertions about how many people would have to actually communicate their explicit intention to conspire? What expert says it is not believable that the president of the U.S. (LBJ) could manipulate a handful of leaders who could issue orders to subordinates, none of whom would know any of the plot?

Common sense says it is astronomically unbelievable that 40 witnesses would get together to corroborate the story that they saw Kennedy only ever slump forward twice and never saw a head snap back and to the left and that the limo stopped or came to a near stop.  (They weren't experiencing time dilation because they didn't know what was happening unlike someone who gets in a car accident.)

8671444,5,B00MBI0B0I,Jim Marrs has done an excellent job in this movie to bring together the distillation of the conspiracy of JFK assassination to voice the opinion succinctly that JFK was killed not by Oswald but by a cabal of those in power. This concise presentation is one of the best and does not get bogged down in minutia but steam rolls through the more obvious and important aspects of this conspiracy to kill JFK. I highly recommend viewing this movie.,1509840000,,442,4.6075949367088604

8671446,5,B00MBI0B0I,"As much as anyone, I think the JFK murder was a CIA/military coup (with mob help) collusion. Jim Marrs was a veteran JFK researcher ever since I can remember. I was 4 when I witnessed the execution of Lee Harvey Oswald on live TV. I was alone in the room sitting about 3 feet from the TV. I remember all this because all violent events are traumatic and are filed (or compartmentalized) in the brain for future analysis because it's all much too much to process at the time it is happening.

Jim Marrs wrote Crossfire in 1993. It was a source for Stone's JFK movie which at least talks about the CIA. I don't know what Stone's motivation was/is. Is he a holly wood shill? Is he involved in the CIA's MK Ultra programs? Or maybe he is actually a holly-weird director with a conscious. If so he is one of the few, IMO

 If anyone wants to see a really good JFK movie, watch ""JFK to 911 Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick"" on the well-known video site. 3 hours but a LOT of content. I don't know if I agree with his analysis of the final head shot but it's possible. Hint: it wasn't Greer the SS driver. Yep it's a new theory (to me anyway) and again it was possible. At over 3 hours it's a VERY good movie to watch.",1507420800,,1211,4.14468085106383
