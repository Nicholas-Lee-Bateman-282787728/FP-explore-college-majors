8437146,5,B004ODNNWG,"Robin Shou has proven himself as an action star to me time and time again, and this film shows that he is a star behind the camera as well. With featured interviews and an exclusive short film cut in between that would give many Hollywood filmmakers a run for their money, Red Trousers provides background and history of a martial art that many are not aware of. The 2-disc edition has extended interviews with Sammo Hung and Lau Kar-Leung Sifu, and previews for many films that feature stunt actors who trained at the Beijing Opera School. I would say it is worth watching, especially if you enjoy action films and have wondered what goes into making the magic happen with no strings attached.",1390867200,2,694,4.650406504065041
