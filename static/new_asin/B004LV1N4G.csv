4405122,5,B004LV1N4G,"This boxed set contains three of Lynch's most surreal films, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. This review is for Lynch fans who have already seen the films so I will not go into detail about the movies themselves, I figure if you are buying the boxed set then in all probability you have seen the films. If you thought these films looked good on DVD then you absolutely must see them on Bluray. The boxed set is from Germany so you will have to change the audio to English if that is your native tongue, it plays on Region A B and C (I just edited this: the description says region B, my set is identical, so contact the seller and tell him to look on the bottom of the box, mine says region ABC region free, if they say it is not, look on other sites because this item is region free on every other site that has it listed) Bluray players which was very hard to find when I bought the set a year ago. Lost Highway looks great on Bluray, it looks like a modern film. I never really thought Inland Empire could look better even on bluray, I was wrong, the resolution is amazing on bluray, perfect. The biggest bonus on this set is Mulholland Drive on Bluray, the film breathtaking to look at. I've watched the film over 20 times in my life, every time I had watched it I would find more clues and interpretations, some of these clues I believe can only be noticed on bluray such as (I won't spoil it) some of the graffiti on a wall during the first diner scene is completely legible, there is a sticker on a post b4 the club silencio scene which I never was able to read. These are the only 2 things that come to mind but i'm sure that there were many more. The only problem that I had with the set were the bonus features, The supplemental features included on the three Blu-ray discs are encoded in PAL. Therefore, you must have a Region-Free player capable of converting PAL to NTSC in order to view them in North America. Therefore, although the three feature films are region-free, the supplemental features for each film are not. But all in all having these 3 masterpieces in one set on bluray is fantastic for me, David Lynch is my favorite director, his films challenge me and that is why I love them. I would love to get all his films on bluray but unfortunately the other boxed set with Blue Velvet, Eraserhead, Twin Peaks FWWM, and Wild at Heart (Lost Highway is also included) is only available to region B so I will wait patiently until the day that they come to region A. If anyone has any further questions about the set please feel free to comment. I hope this review helps.",1359072000,51,2606,4.3095723014256615

4405125,5,B004LV1N4G,"This is great! I've read that the special features won't work on an American bluray player but I watched lost highway on my ps4 and the special features worked! So if u have a ps4 maybe that makes the difference, just thought ps4 people would like to know this info :)",1426032000,13,268,4.2745098039215685
4405126,5,B004LV1N4G,"Well, it's about time! For the longest time the only Lynch movies I was able to get on Blu Ray (besides Dune) includes the French version of Wild at Heart which is picky and for some reason only works in 1 of my 5 BD players, and the player isn't even region free. That doesn't even make sense.

I managed to find a French/Canadian version of Mulholand Drive on HD-DVD which is the only reason I still own an HD-DVD player because my Euro BD of M. Drive is not region free. Now, I can finally watch most of my favorite David Lynch in Blu Ray glory, including other films not included in this collection.

As far as the movies go themselves, well, you either love Lynch or hate him. There are very few people I've encountered that fall in the middle. I could write a book as to why I'm a fan, but I'll make it very short: His movies evoke strong emotions and take me to a different reality to the point I don't know what is truly real... is it the version of me sitting in my recliner in front of the screen, or am inside the screen and in Dave's twisted but genius mind?",1424304000,2,1070,4.139423076923077

4405129,5,B004LV1N4G,Great collection of movies from one of my favorite directors and one of the only ways to watch them on blu-ray in the States. They are intended for the German market so you have to change the language to English when watching them but that's a small price to pay.,1419984000,,263,4.28
4405130,5,B004LV1N4G,"I love David Lynch's work and this set is exquisite. If there are any special features, they don't show up on my Region 1 player; the movie just starts playing when each disk is inserted. Picture and sound are both superb (notice, as other reviewers have already pointed out, you do need to select the English language trackbut that's no challenge) and all of these blu-rays are noticeably better than my older DVDs of these films; a lot of formerly lost detail is now crystal clear, even to the point of each of the stories now actually seeming more comprehensible. I would have preferred Blue Velvet to Lost Highway, but this is a perfect Mulholland Drive (which is one of my favorite films) and Blue Velvet can be bought separately, while, for some reason, American companies just don't want to bring Lynch's other films out on Blu-Ray. Inland Empire is sharp and wonderful; plus it all fits on one disk in this format. Obviously, those who aren't David Lynch fans should go read a lot of other reviews and study up and find out what's these films are all about and what sorts of people love them, before shelling out the cash for three whole films.",1416960000,11,1152,4.597087378640777

4405132,5,B004LV1N4G,"David Lynch is my filmmaking hero.  A man who takes risks that allow us reach into the depths of our imagination.  The risks he takes don't always come off, but that's the nature of risk taking. Each film in this this trilogy looks at the fear that lurks beneath the surface of the American Dream.",1413849600,2,297,4.381818181818182

4405139,3,B004LV1N4G,"I only want to mention that I have purchased this set, and can verify that the disc for Mullholland Drive worked in my American Blu-ray player via Mac Blu-ray Player software. The only hassle is you have to turn off the dubbed-in German soundtrack (which it defaults to) if you don't happen to speak German, but otherwise it seems to work fine. However, the disc for Lost Highway mounted on my drive but would not function in my player software. haven't tried Inland Empire yet.

As for the films themselves: Mullholland Drive is a masterpiece and one of the greatest films of this young century, Lost Highway is a semi-masterpiece, and I haven't made up my mind about Inland Empire.",1390953600,5,683,4.691666666666666
4405140,3,B004LV1N4G,I didn't realize it was primarily in German and a German Language Version. Maybe it was my fault for not looking closely.  I was able to find an English setting though... so that's ok.  Other than that it is great,1383609600,,213,4.3
4405141,3,B004LV1N4G,I was surprised that the sex scene was edited in Mulholland Drive! I watched it on the IFC channel and it was full on Naomi Watts and her amnesia girl friend. This cut was totally lame. Now I am wondering what cuts will be made in the other movies. I thought Germany would be less prudish then the USA.,1382659200,12,302,4.135593220338983
4405142,5,B004LV1N4G,"Great release. Plays on U.S. players. Too bad no U.S. release. Maybe Germany will now release ""The Straight Story"" and ""Twin Peaks; The Series.""",1368057600,11,144,5.041666666666667
8434895,2,B004LV1N4G,"What a horrible misfortunate. Lynch could have been viewed as one of the six or seven greatest directors in the history of worldwide cinema. Right up there with Godard, Fellini, Kurosawa, Wilder, Stevens, Scorsese, and so forth. He can bring camera angles, lighting, and editing together like very few others. And he can command great performances from his actors. Unfortunately, he never got out of junior high school emotionally. His films are into weirdness for weirdness sake. The man is not developmentally different, he's just plain strange. Weirdness with no point to it. Creepy for creepiness sake.

I can't sit through his stuff.",1513209600,,638,5.194174757281553

8434897,3,B004LV1N4G,"It's a great choice for a box set, I love all 3 films. They look wonderful & you can change the language to english quite easily.

8434901,4,B004LV1N4G,"If you are a David Lynch fan and own a Samsung BD player just get it - it's wonderful... I have a 3D Samsung with 4K Upscaling and have absolutely no problem playing the films or any of the Special Features. The quality on each film is superb - without a doubt. the ONLY reason I am not giving this set 5 stars is because it does not come with English Subtitles but the audio is in both English and German and with the press of one button can be switched to English before the film starts - a nearly perfect set. Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire look absolutely fantastic!!!
I actually did not buy my set on Amazon, but got it on eBay for about $30.00 with free shipping so that's $10.00 a film, great deal.
I already had the Criterion Mulholland Drive but wanted Lost Highway and Inland Empire so completely worth it plus the Concorde set has different Mulholland Drive special features and the quality is fantastic so I didn't mind double dipping... I'm in the process of completing my David Lynch Collection on BD and this is an absolute must to own. Eraserhead (Criterion 2nd Pressing), The Elephant Man (Studio Canal Digibook French Import Region A/B) Dune (U.S. Edition), Blue Velvet (U.S. Edition), Twin Peaks the Entire Mystery (Region Free), Wild At Heart (Twilight Time), Lost Highway (Concorde DL Box Set), Mulholland Drive (Concorde or and Criterion), Inland Empire (Concorde DL Box Set), Duran Duran Upstaged (Japanese Import).

8434904,5,B004LV1N4G,Worth it for the high quality German remaster of Lost Highway alone. It looks and sounds great. You will have to change the language to English if that is what you speak though. Small price to pay for the quality though.,1440892800,,220,4.390243902439025
