3122009,3,B00142UZ9O,"Warriors of the Deep was part of Peter Davison's 3rd and final season as the young & vulnerable 5th incarnation of the Doctor. Final down to a mere two companions, Davison's run as the Doctor had it's fair share of returning classic foes, this time was a double dip. The Sea Devils and the Silurians, both from Jon Pertwee's run as the third Doctor, are really a natural pairing as they are both prehistoric-sea species of Earth, it is almost astonishing that it hadn't been done earlier. Although the earlier incarnation of the Doctor could very easily been inserted in the place of the actual incumbent, most of the dialogue could have come from that era, down to the Doctor's thinly veiled distain for the destroyer / conqueror side of Humanity, thus his classic closing quote draws in sharp relief the return of the love/hate attitude that was in so much the third Doctor's lines, ""there should have been another way...""  This time the monsters are indigenous Earth prehistoric creatures so the humans are already the invaders in the scenario. Last time the Doctor faced the Silurians he made some hard choices of conscience bordering on treason (in UNIT's eyes) to do the right thing, as it were. This time that moral convection kind seems worn and thin, admittedly inspite of his young appearance this is an older Doctor, and in this story, a usually pessimistic Doctor.

This the 131st story or the six-hundredth and third episode of the 21st season aired in 1984. This was really a golden-age for the series (much like now with the 2005 return of the show). Of course, Tom Baker, like most Americans my age was ""my Doctor,"" but having followed the show through the reworking of the series by executive producer John-Nathan Turner (much like Russell T. Davies reworking for the 21st cen. ) I was as invested in Davison's portrayal as Baker's. This particular season was maybe the darkest of the series history (up `til then, see the Attack of the Cybermen with the 6th Doctor), with dark stories like Resurrection of the Daleks and the Caves of Androzani following this one, all with high body counts. ""Warriors of the Deep"" is set, like many of this era in the futuristic twenty-first century where a deep undersea base is under attack. Unlike most stories in Doctor Who's history the returning reptilians are unceremoniously revealed seconds into the show, as opposed to the traditional monster reveal at the closing minutes of the 1st part. Anyway, minus the loss of suspense, the creatures, like all returning monsters are all ""80ed"" up with body armor and latex. Another mystery revealed early is the entire plan of the baddies, followed by the Doctor's discovery of an obvious story resolution minutes upon boarding the base. This discovery is the Hexachromite gas which is serendipitously deadly to all reptile life.

The human characters aren't particularly likeable (maybe it's the eye shadow), partly by design to make us more sympathetic towards the oppressed sea species, very much the voice of the 80's, if only Sting had arrived in time to perform a benefit concert for them.
Unfortunately the ""monster"" characters are no more likeable, between the Sea Devils and the Silurians weird voices their lines are hard to understand and all that costume and latex remove all opportunity for any facial expressions from the characters. But, the Doctor's companions aren't free of blame, Tegan and Turlough (who are both intolerable at the best of times) immediately leave the Doctor for dead deciding he's drowned instantly because his fallen in some water at the episode's cliffhanger. Turlough does counter this later by melodramatically offering that Tegan save herself while he scurries toward eminent danger (which just seem contradictory, really.) Speaking of companions...where is Kamelion, the shape-shifting robot, who will serve as a plot device in ""Planet of Fire?""
Are his batteries low?

One major complaint about this one is on the technical side, the Silurians secret weapon is an oversized sea monster which sets Doctor Who back decades! In what is a pretty good story arc, with the return of some classic monsters, we have the ""WORST CREATURE"" presentation in I would dare to say the series multi-decade history (20 years at the point this was aired.) Bar none. The Myrka, as it is called looks like a scale pantomime lizard-horse, which is precisely what it is. Obviously, a couple of actors shuffling down halls, really well-light halls I might add.  But to add insult to injury one character sees fit to disbatch this embarrassing creature in the most embarrassing manner, ninja-kick to the lizard gut!!!  Pity considering the underwater base is one of the best sets of the season.

Over all this one just mixes too many genres to work effectively. It seems unsure of weather it wants to be a stylized action adventure or meaty drama with true emotional impact, resulting in flatly achieving neither. I love the 5th Doctor's final season but this one was poorly handled, even if it does round off a trilogy of prehistoric monster stories including: ""The Silurians"" and ""The Sea Devils.""  Both of those should be released along with this DVD. Watch for Doctor Who - Beneath The Surface (Doctor Who And The Silurians / The Sea Devils / Warriors Of The Deep)the boxed set.

3122011,4,B00142UZ9O,"This is one of the better Peter Davison episodes that I've seen (Caves of Androzani being the best). This is a classic episode with classic villians. Here's some notes about the DVD and the purchase experience.

3. The entire episode takes place in n underwater base (not a quarry)
4. The sets and costumes are on par with classic Doctor Who standards.
5. The story is a little all over the place with multiple villians and story threads. The different threads aren't setup the best and leaves a lot of questions.

That one function is served by the story.

Beyond that, the product suffers from many problems. The budgetary issues are the most glaring. It's hard to remember when effects have looked worse as the Doctor tries to pry an obviously foam ""wall"" off of Tegan. The story features the re-introduction of the Silurians and the Sea Devils and they look far worse than they did when they last appeared on Doctor Who more than a decade previously.

In addition, the story manages to mangle the established history of both species in Doctor Who. In addition, much of the run-time is taken up by a completely extraneous spy plot. And with the exception of the Captain, there's really no reason to care about any of the guest characters. Overall, this is the weakest Fifth Doctor story and perhaps the weakest story of a Season that also included the Twin Dilemma.",1464739200,,1161,4.7711442786069655

3122015,4,B00142UZ9O,"A good story for the Doctor and a reprise for two ""monsters"" from the Pertwee era, the Silurians and the Sea Devils. Unfortunately the story suffered from a few issues which knocked a star off the rating. I felt the overall story was strong enough to compensate for most of the deficiencies.

Primarily, the Silurians and Sea Devils seemed more cumbersome than in the earlier serials and the Myrka seemed extremely cumbersome. An unusually rushed production schedule for the story didn't help matters either. Ingrid Pitt's performance was almost laughable, especially her martial arts performance against the Myrka. The story also had a few continuity issues from the original serials but overall they didn't get in the way of the story.

There were many strong points however in the acting. Outside of Ingrid Pitt who was going at it a bit over the top, the other actors played their roles believably. Tom Adams as Vorshak was very well done.

This story was kind of a diamond in the rough really and didn't get the time needed to be cut and polished up properly but still, it was an enjoyable adventure with the Doctor. If they had the time to work on the story a bit more and the time to do the props and effects as planned, the story could have been one of the top 10 classic stories.",1446249600,,1288,4.615720524017467

3122019,5,B00142UZ9O,"Yes Icthar, I agree. Doctor Who Warriors of the Deep is an excellent story, and I liked it a lot. As you probably know, Doctor Who has never been a show (until now maybe) that has been known for stunning special effects, but there are still some great things in this story.

For one, I really like the Silurian costumes, and although the smiling is a bit tacky, it has lots of detail, and they really look very reptilian. The Sea Devils are nice too in my opinion, and I think the samurai armor was a nice touch. Yes, I noticed that the Sea Devil heads were tilted and seemed a bit wobbly, but maybe they just suffered a bit of tissue and muscular degeneration like Icthar said in part one. Also, I have seen in a lot of reviews that the pace of the Sea Devils and Silurians is a bit too lackadaisical, but to me it is great. Just think about it, large reptiles with thickly armored scales protecting them. Considering that many animals like that are somewhat handicapped by their lack of defined joints, I think they seem very realistic.

Then there are the sets. Yes, I know the sets shake horribly during the fight between the doctor and the guards at the end of episode one/beginning of episode two. But if you watch the making of the show in the special features, you would learn that they were up against a rock and a hard place so to speak with this story, and I think they really pulled it off.

Lastly, I thought that the acting was great in this story, except for the fact that many of the deaths by the Myrka were quite corny and seemed fake. To better realize this character, I recommend watching the, ""They Came from Beneath the Sea"" and ""The Depths"" commentaries with the actors playing the Myrka, because I think it helps to realize the creature better.

As a closing note, I would just like to say that  I hope that anyone who watches this realizes that you have to be watching with the attitude that this will be a good story, because if you do not, you'll end up only seeing all the bad things there are to be seen. After all, this is Doctor Who and if you can only judge a show on how many explosions there are, and how many CGI shots have been made, then maybe you aren't a real classic Doctor Who fan. You have to really think, and imagine the story beyond the small world they are able to project to you.",1416009600,2,2326,4.277272727272727

3122023,5,B00142UZ9O,"In the Peter Davidson era of Doctor Who episode entitled ""Warriors of the Deep"" The Doctor, Tegan and turlough have come to the 22nd century of Earth where two great powers are in control with bases ready to aim weapons of such power that they could kill everything in seconds.
  The TARDIS is being targeted by a space satellite and demands codes to prove they are not the enemy.  In the last seconds before its missles hit the TARDIS they move to a sea base deep within the ocean.  The base a secert location that houses weapons poised to attack when the correct codes are given.  On board the Commander along with his senior crew are at battle stations and fear the worse.  However one of them is really a traitor and has secertly kiled the key code officer and placed a back up tech not suited for the job on hand.  What the Commander doesn't know is that he is going to be betrayed by the rival power of the Eastern Block and gain the codes needed to destoy thier weapons for good and end the stalemate.
  While this is going on a strange alien craft has been searching the deep ocean for something and they have found it.  A Sed Devil colony that went into deep slumber millions of years ago to avoid the dangers that never came to happen.  The aliens in questions are none other then the Silaurians.  A race that lived before mankind left the trees and awoke during a time when the Doctor was on Earth and working with U.N.I.T only to have them blow up the caverns in which they went into slumber.  Only three survivied that explosion and now they have a small army togo through with thier plans. To destroy mankind and retake the Earth for themselves.
  The Doctor discovers its the Siluarians and pleads with them not to go through with thier plans.  He still belives that Humans and Silariuans can live together and be at peace.  However the Siluarians want nothing of what he says and the humans want to destroy while they recive a code stating to luanch missles and begin the attack.
  Can the Doctor make peace and see everyone live to see tomorrow?  Will the Siluarians win and claim the Earth with the Sea Devils?  What of the spy on the base? What of his plans will they come about or will the depths of the ocean crush him and his plans forever?  Tune in to see in ""Warriors of the Deep"".",1344988800,,2305,4.36150234741784
3122024,2,B00142UZ9O,"This Season 21 story, set between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Five-Doctors-Story-130-25th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0017XOFGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Five Doctors (Story 130) (25th Anniversary Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Awakening-Episode-132/dp/B004TPJMQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Awakening - Episode 132</a>, stars Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor, accompanied by Tegan (Janet Fielding) and Turlough (Mark Strickson).

For the first-time viewer, the setup of the Doctor Who series is basic enough: the Doctor is an alien who adventures in time and space in his TARDIS, usually with a human companion or two.  The villains in this story - the Silurians and Sea Devils - have appeared in previous stories, but since the writer here couldn't get the continuity right, there's no reason for you to care.  This can be taken as a stand-alone.

The TARDIS returns to 21st-century Earth, a time when the world is divided into two opposing power blocs faced with the prospect of mutually assured destruction.  After a run-in with a defence satellite, the TARDIS makes an emergency landing on Seabase Four, a secret missile launch facility - just in time for a strike by human traitors and an invasion by the Silurians and their Sea Devil troops.

The issues that plagued this production don't really matter; we have to judge what it is, not what it should have been.  Unfortunately, what it is, is pretty bad.

The setup had potential and I like the model work, set design and costumes.  But otherwise, this story has little going for it and the directing is a significant factor in this.  The action scenes lack credibility and the whole thing really drags.  This is partly because of the insane decision to make the Silurians and Sea Devils m-o-v-e a-n-d s-p-e-a-k s-o s-l-o-w-l-y, and partly because of the time wasted on woeful moments of ""humour"" and soapie-style significant looks.  The lengthy reprises at the start of episodes 2-4 suggest there wasn't enough script to fill the running time.  Curiously, everyone has time to make speeches in supposedly urgent situations.  The music is very annoying.

The acting is quite variable.  Peter Davison is excellent,  Mark Strickson is terrible.  Janet Fielding is fine, but has nothing much to do.  The guest cast range from just passable (Tara Ward as Preston) to good (Tom Ward as Vorshak).  The extras can't even die convincingly.

But the director and the actors certainly weren't helped by the script, which has an awful lot wrong with it.  Generally speaking, the dialogue is clunky, full of info-dumps and loaded with clichs, and it employs strange circumlocutions instead of just naming things.  Continuity with the previous appearances of the Silurians and Sea Devils is handled very badly.  If you know your past history, it's all wrong in this story, which undermines its credibility; if you don't, the Silurians and Sea Devils do nothing to justify the Doctor's defence of them, so why should we care about his posturing or their fate?  This issue undermines any claims to a message the story may have been intended to have.

Turlough's characterisation is all over the shop.  He's cowardly, then brave, then cowardly again; he's ready to cut and run to save himself, then he's handing out moral advice and judgements to the Doctor.  As for the Doctor himself, he comes close to single-handedly ruining this story.  He makes erratic, nonsensical decisions, doesn't share enough information and doesn't take decisive action until it's too late.  You're supposed to admire his ethics and feel for him in his dilemma, but he's responsible for all those deaths because he didn't want to get his hands dirty.  Turlough seems angry with him at the end, and that's how I felt, too.  Self-indulgent plonker.

Overall verdict: this is hardly Doctor Who at its finest.",1331596800,,3998,5.45928338762215
3122025,3,B00142UZ9O,"Ok, the classic series of Doctor Who was under-funded. I get it. Enough already. We see the cheesy special effects and man-in the-rubber-suit monsters and aliens. Is it really necessary to have DVD extras and special features with documentaries and interviews showing the actors and creative people going on about ""we didn't have the money"", ""we were short on time"". How about just using what you have to make an entertaining story? It had worked for Doctor Who for 20 years up to the ""Warriors of the Deep"". I think I could have liked this story if not for all that whining. So I will just say that this story is only ""worth a look"". And do yourself a favor...don't bother with the DVD extras or special features. No wonder all 3 of the main characters (the Doctor included) choose to leave the show at the end of this season. I could tell how short on time they were making this story. What actor would want a rush rush story...and the final result being completely sub-standard. I used to be sad Peter Davison left the show, now he has my sympathy. I bought this story as part of the ""Beneath the Surface"" collection and the 2 Jon Pertwee stories were much superior to this one, and they were done in the early 1970's.

Set in 2084 (one hundred years after the production date), the location is an undersea missile launching base.  Two large power blocs have consolidated their hold over Earth and tensions are rising.  We aren't told anything about the two power blocs.  From what is shown on screen, one can only deduce that one bloc is dignified and sensible, with reasonable security precautions and with only minute amounts of eyeliner distributed to their populous...  while we're stuck in the other one.  Meanwhile, both sets of Earth Reptiles are back and they have decided to invade this base for their own purposes.

It's difficult to know where to begin when discussing this serial's problems.  The DVD extras make much out of the fact that an unexpected Parliamentary election meant that the crew lost two weeks of rehearsal, pre-production and production time (the news division of the BBC required the studio space).  This lack of preparation time is very evident.

First of all, it's impossible for the sets to give any atmosphere to the story.  The walls, the props, the doors, everything is bright white and garishly lit.  There are no shadows for the monsters to lurk in.  The harsh lights also reveal a lot of the other production flaws.  Every prop looks extremely flimsy.  The Sea Devils' heads appear in danger of falling off.  The lighting really puts a giant exclamation mark on what is probably the worst realized monster ever seen on Doctor Who, the Myrka.

The biggest flaw in the story is the lack of any obvious ambiguity despite the repeated attempts by the Doctor to state that there is one.  The Silurians act just like every other monster invader on Doctor Who.  They're remorseless killers, placing no value in human life.  In the earlier stories they had been portrayed as intelligent, thoughtful creatures capable of violence but also reason.  This allowed the script to explore the morality involved with starting a war against such beings.  But that doesn't work here  because there simply isn't any reason for the audience to have sympathy with the invaders.

That said, there's no real reason to empathize with the humans on the base either.  I couldn't name a single interesting or sympathetic character.  Most of them are simply plot cyphers, frantically shouting their lines to convey the current state of the story, and then casually killed off when they're no longer needed.  The most impressive things about the base commander are his eyebrows.

So, we lose the moral complexity of THE SILURIANS, and we also lose the great action sequences of THE SEA DEVILS.  THE SEA DEVILS had some great stunt work done by the HAVOC team.  Great battle sequences, some decent special effects (when used sparingly).  But twelve years later, that aspect of the production looks far worse.  The special effects are heavily based on the level of electronic effects that were state-of-the-art for the BBC in the 1980s.  They therefore have aged far worse than the simple but effective explosive charges and physical special effects of the 1970s.

The choreography of the battle sequences also leaves something to be desired.  That is to say, there isn't any.  As Peter Davison points out in the DVD extras, the two opposing armies simple stand in a line and shoot at each other.  It looks absolutely ridiculous.  There's no tension.  No menace from the monsters.  The viewer simply has to wait for a battle to end before the next scene can begin.

These Doctor Who DVDs are always loaded with extras but apart from the great commentary track, even those extras seemed a little on the dull side.  Unlike other DVD documentaries where the participants seem amused by some of the production flaws (such as portions of the documentary on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ARC-OF-INFINITY/dp/B000TSTEOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ARC OF INFINITY</a>&nbsp;DVD concerning the design of the big chicken monster), everyone still seems to be a little stunned to realize that they were part of this story.  There's no joy had in revisiting the past; they all just seem annoyed they had neither the time nor the budget to do the show properly.

That said, the DVD commentary track is great, partially because the static battle sequences and boring dialog on screen allows the participants to go off on interesting tangents.  Peter Davison talks about his decision to leave the show after three years (the was the first story he made after that decision, and he probably felt vindicated).  Janet Fielding, Peter Davison and script editor Eric Saward discuss some of the good and most of the bad things about producer John Nathan-Turner's approach to the show without sounding bitter or insulting.  Visual effects designer Mat Irvine attempts to keep the focus on what's actually appearing on the screen, and then spends a lot of time explaining what exactly was up with the Myrka.

This serial was not well received when it was made and time has not been kind to it.  As a sequel it completely fails to recapture what made the originals fun.  What do you get if you take two previous stories and remove everything that was great  about them?  The answer is you get a lot of extras in the same type of rubber suits that came before, but not much else.",1217721600,4,6325,5.412065439672801
3122028,3,B00142UZ9O,"Over the many decades of its existence, Doctor Who has always been a show full of ideas--almost endlessly inventive and creative. ""Warriors of the Deep"" is no different. What a fantastic idea, bringing back the Silurians and the Sea Devils! The basic concept of this story brims with excellent potential and fantastic possibilities. All of which gets tanked like the Titanic by inept realization and shoddy production, sad to say.

What could've gone wrong? The Silurians and the Sea Devils, reptilian Earthlings from before the age of humankind who want their planet back, definitely count as some of the more intriguingly original and complex foes (one can't really say villains per se) from the era of the Third Doctor. Now more than a decade and two Doctors later, surely their tale can be developed in new ways. And to some degree ""Warriors of the Deep"" does indeed manage gestures in this direction, giving them individual names and personalities, revealing little aspects of their society and politics, and alluding to their ethical systems and life philosophies. On a different level, furthermore, those subtle but vaguely noticeable hints of a Cold War allegory wafting about before in the Silurian/Sea Devil stories by Malcolm Hulke are here cleverly brought vividly to the foreground by Johnny Byrne. He rephrases the conflict as that between two (wisely unnamed) competing human power-blocs in 2084, a conflict the reptilians intend to capitalize upon by hijacking an undersea station and provoking both sides to destroy each other, leaving the Earth all for themselves again. In 1984 such a ""mutually assured destruction"" premise was sure to get a viewer's attention, no doubt about it. And it still has something to say yet.

But whenever you bring back old foes there's always the risk of diminishing returns, and that's what happens here. All the moral complexity of the human/reptilian conflict is glossed over rather than actually portrayed and explored as it was before. It's taken for granted, really, and you have the Doctor ranting about how nice and civilized the Silurians are to his companions and the other (realistically unlikable) humans on the military sea-base, but so far all this story has in actuality shown them doing is being sneaky, mean, and nasty. In a misplaced attempt at continuity, the Silurians claim that twice before they offered the hand of peace to the humans and aren't inclined to do so again. This is a gross misrepresentation and oversimplification of the prior two stories that we are apparently meant to take at face value--a vast proportion of those stories' greatness owes itself to the fact that inevitable tragedy was brought about by aggressive and narrow-minded individuals on BOTH sides. To put all the blame on the humans and absolve the reptilians sounds sophisticated at first but in the end vastly mutes the intriguing moral dilemma involved (as well as being just factually wrong). To add insult to injury, the Silurians' ethical justification for triggering genocide is the most laughably contorted heap of mendacious sophistry imaginable, but again we're clearly meant to take it seriously--the Doctor, our compass of right and wrong here, listens to it all without so much as a blink or sarcastically wry smile. In short, the whole conflict driving the plot is unsatisfying and unconvincing, sinking the overall story like lead. Clunk.

A million other things go wrong with the actual production, and it would try the patience of this reviewer and any hapless readers to list them all. The extras go into them in hilarious detail, anyway. An important point key to the story though would be the actual costumes for the Silurians and Sea Devils: they look cooler and more realistic, and even have some animatronic eyelids, but something about their design is obviously more hindering than the earlier ones in the 1970's so that the reptilian characters come across as far less agile and realistic in their actual movements, making the battle scenes almost embarrassingly laughable--don't expect one of these Sea Devils to die with a back flip like in 1972. Anyway, and speaking of Cold Wars, Karl Marx might as well have been referring to ""Warriors of the Deep"" when he quipped that history repeats itself, first as tragedy and then as farce.

P.S. I know, I know, I keep referring to the two prior stories featuring Silurians & Sea Devils ad nauseum, but those classics and this DVD can all be obtained in one conveniently nifty package:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Beneath-The-Surface-Doctor-Who-And-The-Silurians-The-Sea-Devils-Warriors-Of-The-Deep/dp/B0013XZ6T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Beneath The Surface (Doctor Who And The Silurians / The Sea Devils / Warriors Of The Deep)</a>.",1213401600,5,4826,5.296344647519582
3122029,5,B00142UZ9O,"Honestly, this Doctor Who story should have been one of the first of Peter Davison's Doctor Who's to be released to DVD.  I rank this one right up there with Earthshock (which I think is his overall best story) and The Visitation.

The Silurians and Sea Devils, together, return in a future Earth time period for the magnificent Doctor Who story ""Warriors of the Deep."" Their previous experience with humans has taught them that the human race can not be trusted. They decide they have no alternative but to wipe out humanity once and for all in order to reclaim the world they once called home.

To do so, they assault and take over an undersea missile base to start a nuclear war that will destroy the ""ape-primitives"" with their own weapons.  This compelling story gives Peter Davison a chance to shine as a dramatic actor, with the Doctor not sure who he is more angry with-the Silurians or the humans. Especially since in a sub-story, human agents from a rival power have also infiltraited the sea base and unleash murder and treachery even amongst the Silurian and Sea Devil onslaught.

I really liked the fact that many of the human characters in the story, even some of the so-called good guys, were not really all that likeable.  They were cranky, irritable, stubborn, and very quick to threaten force on the Doctor and his friends to get them to cooperate.  Which makes total sense for characters who have been stuck in an undersea military base for months on end and are now under attack by unknown forces.

I also really liked the sets in this story.  It seems they really put a lot of time, energy, effort, and money into making the setting really look like a futuristic undersea base.  Right down to large water tanks for reactor coolant, which they use quite well in the story.

Ultimately, the Doctor is forced to make a choice-either destroy the Silurians and Sea Devils or let them slaughter all of humanity? This is despite the fact that the Doctor sympathizes with the Silurians and knows the history of their disastrous encounters with humanity in the past. When the Doctor finally makes his choice, his feelings could best be summed up in the Doctor's own simple, yet heartbreakingly spoken words, ""there should have been another way.""",1208476800,4,2257,4.717557251908397
3356506,3,B00142UZ9O,"Warriors of the Deep was part of Peter Davison's 3rd and final season as the young & vulnerable 5th incarnation of the Doctor. Final down to a mere two companions, Davison's run as the Doctor had it's fair share of returning classic foes, this time was a double dip. The Sea Devils and the Silurians, both from Jon Pertwee's run as the third Doctor, are really a natural pairing as they are both prehistoric-sea species of Earth, it is almost astonishing that it hadn't been done earlier. Although the earlier incarnation of the Doctor could very easily been inserted in the place of the actual incumbent, most of the dialogue could have come from that era, down to the Doctor's thinly veiled distain for the destroyer / conqueror side of Humanity, thus his classic closing quote draws in sharp relief the return of the love/hate attitude that was in so much the third Doctor's lines, ""there should have been another way...""  This time the monsters are indigenous Earth prehistoric creatures so the humans are already the invaders in the scenario. Last time the Doctor faced the Silurians he made some hard choices of conscience bordering on treason (in UNIT's eyes) to do the right thing, as it were. This time that moral convection kind seems worn and thin, admittedly inspite of his young appearance this is an older Doctor, and in this story, a usually pessimistic Doctor.

This the 131st story or the six-hundredth and third episode of the 21st season aired in 1984. This was really a golden-age for the series (much like now with the 2005 return of the show). Of course, Tom Baker, like most Americans my age was ""my Doctor,"" but having followed the show through the reworking of the series by executive producer John-Nathan Turner (much like Russell T. Davies reworking for the 21st cen. ) I was as invested in Davison's portrayal as Baker's. This particular season was maybe the darkest of the series history (up `til then, see the Attack of the Cybermen with the 6th Doctor), with dark stories like Resurrection of the Daleks and the Caves of Androzani following this one, all with high body counts. ""Warriors of the Deep"" is set, like many of this era in the futuristic twenty-first century where a deep undersea base is under attack. Unlike most stories in Doctor Who's history the returning reptilians are unceremoniously revealed seconds into the show, as opposed to the traditional monster reveal at the closing minutes of the 1st part. Anyway, minus the loss of suspense, the creatures, like all returning monsters are all ""80ed"" up with body armor and latex. Another mystery revealed early is the entire plan of the baddies, followed by the Doctor's discovery of an obvious story resolution minutes upon boarding the base. This discovery is the Hexachromite gas which is serendipitously deadly to all reptile life.

The human characters aren't particularly likeable (maybe it's the eye shadow), partly by design to make us more sympathetic towards the oppressed sea species, very much the voice of the 80's, if only Sting had arrived in time to perform a benefit concert for them.
Unfortunately the ""monster"" characters are no more likeable, between the Sea Devils and the Silurians weird voices their lines are hard to understand and all that costume and latex remove all opportunity for any facial expressions from the characters. But, the Doctor's companions aren't free of blame, Tegan and Turlough (who are both intolerable at the best of times) immediately leave the Doctor for dead deciding he's drowned instantly because his fallen in some water at the episode's cliffhanger. Turlough does counter this later by melodramatically offering that Tegan save herself while he scurries toward eminent danger (which just seem contradictory, really.) Speaking of companions...where is Kamelion, the shape-shifting robot, who will serve as a plot device in ""Planet of Fire?""
Are his batteries low?

One major complaint about this one is on the technical side, the Silurians secret weapon is an oversized sea monster which sets Doctor Who back decades! In what is a pretty good story arc, with the return of some classic monsters, we have the ""WORST CREATURE"" presentation in I would dare to say the series multi-decade history (20 years at the point this was aired.) Bar none. The Myrka, as it is called looks like a scale pantomime lizard-horse, which is precisely what it is. Obviously, a couple of actors shuffling down halls, really well-light halls I might add.  But to add insult to injury one character sees fit to disbatch this embarrassing creature in the most embarrassing manner, ninja-kick to the lizard gut!!!  Pity considering the underwater base is one of the best sets of the season.

Over all this one just mixes too many genres to work effectively. It seems unsure of weather it wants to be a stylized action adventure or meaty drama with true emotional impact, resulting in flatly achieving neither. I love the 5th Doctor's final season but this one was poorly handled, even if it does round off a trilogy of prehistoric monster stories including: ""The Silurians"" and ""The Sea Devils.""  Both of those should be released along with this DVD. Watch for Doctor Who - Beneath The Surface (Doctor Who And The Silurians / The Sea Devils / Warriors Of The Deep)the boxed set.

That one function is served by the story.

Beyond that, the product suffers from many problems. The budgetary issues are the most glaring. It's hard to remember when effects have looked worse as the Doctor tries to pry an obviously foam ""wall"" off of Tegan. The story features the re-introduction of the Silurians and the Sea Devils and they look far worse than they did when they last appeared on Doctor Who more than a decade previously.

In addition, the story manages to mangle the established history of both species in Doctor Who. In addition, much of the run-time is taken up by a completely extraneous spy plot.

3356512,4,B00142UZ9O,"A good story for the Doctor and a reprise for two ""monsters"" from the Pertwee era, the Silurians and the Sea Devils. Unfortunately the story suffered from a few issues which knocked a star off the rating. I felt the overall story was strong enough to compensate for most of the deficiencies.

Primarily, the Silurians and Sea Devils seemed more cumbersome than in the earlier serials and the Myrka seemed extremely cumbersome. An unusually rushed production schedule for the story didn't help matters either. Ingrid Pitt's performance was almost laughable, especially her martial arts performance against the Myrka. The story also had a few continuity issues from the original serials but overall they didn't get in the way of the story.

There were many strong points however in the acting. Outside of Ingrid Pitt who was going at it a bit over the top, the other actors played their roles believably. Tom Adams as Vorshak was very well done.

This story was kind of a diamond in the rough really and didn't get the time needed to be cut and polished up properly but still, it was an enjoyable adventure with the Doctor. If they had the time to work on the story a bit more and the time to do the props and effects as planned, the story could have been one of the top 10 classic stories.",1446249600,,1288,4.615720524017467

3356516,5,B00142UZ9O,"Yes Icthar, I agree. Doctor Who Warriors of the Deep is an excellent story, and I liked it a lot. As you probably know, Doctor Who has never been a show (until now maybe) that has been known for stunning special effects, but there are still some great things in this story.

For one, I really like the Silurian costumes, and although the smiling is a bit tacky, it has lots of detail, and they really look very reptilian. The Sea Devils are nice too in my opinion, and I think the samurai armor was a nice touch. Yes, I noticed that the Sea Devil heads were tilted and seemed a bit wobbly, but maybe they just suffered a bit of tissue and muscular degeneration like Icthar said in part one. Also, I have seen in a lot of reviews that the pace of the Sea Devils and Silurians is a bit too lackadaisical, but to me it is great. Just think about it, large reptiles with thickly armored scales protecting them. Considering that many animals like that are somewhat handicapped by their lack of defined joints, I think they seem very realistic.

Then there are the sets. Yes, I know the sets shake horribly during the fight between the doctor and the guards at the end of episode one/beginning of episode two. But if you watch the making of the show in the special features, you would learn that they were up against a rock and a hard place so to speak with this story, and I think they really pulled it off.

Lastly, I thought that the acting was great in this story, except for the fact that many of the deaths by the Myrka were quite corny and seemed fake. To better realize this character, I recommend watching the, ""They Came from Beneath the Sea"" and ""The Depths"" commentaries with the actors playing the Myrka, because I think it helps to realize the creature better.

As a closing note, I would just like to say that  I hope that anyone who watches this realizes that you have to be watching with the attitude that this will be a good story, because if you do not, you'll end up only seeing all the bad things there are to be seen. After all, this is Doctor Who and if you can only judge a show on how many explosions there are, and how many CGI shots have been made, then maybe you aren't a real classic Doctor Who fan.

  The TARDIS is being targeted by a space satellite and demands codes to prove they are not the enemy.  In the last seconds before its missles hit the TARDIS they move to a sea base deep within the ocean.  The base a secert location that houses weapons poised to attack when the correct codes are given.  On board the Commander along with his senior crew are at battle stations and fear the worse.  However one of them is really a traitor and has secertly kiled the key code officer and placed a back up tech not suited for the job on hand.  What the Commander doesn't know is that he is going to be betrayed by the rival power of the Eastern Block and gain the codes needed to destoy thier weapons for good and end the stalemate.
  While this is going on a strange alien craft has been searching the deep ocean for something and they have found it.  A Sed Devil colony that went into deep slumber millions of years ago to avoid the dangers that never came to happen.  The aliens in questions are none other then the Silaurians.  A race that lived before mankind left the trees and awoke during a time when the Doctor was on Earth and working with U.N.I.T only to have them blow up the caverns in which they went into slumber.  Only three survivied that explosion and now they have a small army togo through with thier plans. To destroy mankind and retake the Earth for themselves.

However the Siluarians want nothing of what he says and the humans want to destroy while they recive a code stating to luanch missles and begin the attack.
  Can the Doctor make peace and see everyone live to see tomorrow?  Will the Siluarians win and claim the Earth with the Sea Devils?  What of the spy on the base? What of his plans will they come about or will the depths of the ocean crush him and his plans forever?  Tune in to see in ""Warriors of the Deep"".",1344988800,,2305,4.36150234741784

For the first-time viewer, the setup of the Doctor Who series is basic enough: the Doctor is an alien who adventures in time and space in his TARDIS, usually with a human companion or two.  The villains in this story - the Silurians and Sea Devils - have appeared in previous stories, but since the writer here couldn't get the continuity right, there's no reason for you to care.  This can be taken as a stand-alone.

The TARDIS returns to 21st-century Earth, a time when the world is divided into two opposing power blocs faced with the prospect of mutually assured destruction.  After a run-in with a defence satellite, the TARDIS makes an emergency landing on Seabase Four, a secret missile launch facility - just in time for a strike by human traitors and an invasion by the Silurians and their Sea Devil troops.

The issues that plagued this production don't really matter; we have to judge what it is, not what it should have been.  Unfortunately, what it is, is pretty bad.

The setup had potential and I like the model work, set design and costumes.  But otherwise, this story has little going for it and the directing is a significant factor in this.  The action scenes lack credibility and the whole thing really drags.  This is partly because of the insane decision to make the Silurians and Sea Devils m-o-v-e a-n-d s-p-e-a-k s-o s-l-o-w-l-y, and partly because of the time wasted on woeful moments of ""humour"" and soapie-style significant looks.  The lengthy reprises at the start of episodes 2-4 suggest there wasn't enough script to fill the running time.  Curiously, everyone has time to make speeches in supposedly urgent situations.  The music is very annoying.

The acting is quite variable.  Peter Davison is excellent,  Mark Strickson is terrible.  Janet Fielding is fine, but has nothing much to do.  The guest cast range from just passable (Tara Ward as Preston) to good (Tom Ward as Vorshak).  The extras can't even die convincingly.

But the director and the actors certainly weren't helped by the script, which has an awful lot wrong with it.  Generally speaking, the dialogue is clunky, full of info-dumps and loaded with clichs, and it employs strange circumlocutions instead of just naming things.  Continuity with the previous appearances of the Silurians and Sea Devils is handled very badly.  If you know your past history, it's all wrong in this story, which undermines its credibility; if you don't, the Silurians and Sea Devils do nothing to justify the Doctor's defence of them, so why should we care about his posturing or their fate?  This issue undermines any claims to a message the story may have been intended to have.

Turlough's characterisation is all over the shop.  He's cowardly, then brave, then cowardly again; he's ready to cut and run to save himself, then he's handing out moral advice and judgements to the Doctor.  As for the Doctor himself, he comes close to single-handedly ruining this story.  He makes erratic, nonsensical decisions, doesn't share enough information and doesn't take decisive action until it's too late.  You're supposed to admire his ethics and feel for him in his dilemma, but he's responsible for all those deaths because he didn't want to get his hands dirty.  Turlough seems angry with him at the end, and that's how I felt, too.  Self-indulgent plonker.

Overall verdict: this is hardly Doctor Who at its finest.",1331596800,,3998,5.45928338762215
3356522,3,B00142UZ9O,"Ok, the classic series of Doctor Who was under-funded. I get it. Enough already. We see the cheesy special effects and man-in the-rubber-suit monsters and aliens.

Set in 2084 (one hundred years after the production date), the location is an undersea missile launching base.  Two large power blocs have consolidated their hold over Earth and tensions are rising.  We aren't told anything about the two power blocs.  From what is shown on screen, one can only deduce that one bloc is dignified and sensible, with reasonable security precautions and with only minute amounts of eyeliner distributed to their populous...  while we're stuck in the other one.  Meanwhile, both sets of Earth Reptiles are back and they have decided to invade this base for their own purposes.

It's difficult to know where to begin when discussing this serial's problems.  The DVD extras make much out of the fact that an unexpected Parliamentary election meant that the crew lost two weeks of rehearsal, pre-production and production time (the news division of the BBC required the studio space).  This lack of preparation time is very evident.

First of all, it's impossible for the sets to give any atmosphere to the story.  The walls, the props, the doors, everything is bright white and garishly lit.  There are no shadows for the monsters to lurk in.  The harsh lights also reveal a lot of the other production flaws.  Every prop looks extremely flimsy.  The Sea Devils' heads appear in danger of falling off.  The lighting really puts a giant exclamation mark on what is probably the worst realized monster ever seen on Doctor Who, the Myrka.

The biggest flaw in the story is the lack of any obvious ambiguity despite the repeated attempts by the Doctor to state that there is one.  The Silurians act just like every other monster invader on Doctor Who.  They're remorseless killers, placing no value in human life.  In the earlier stories they had been portrayed as intelligent, thoughtful creatures capable of violence but also reason.  This allowed the script to explore the morality involved with starting a war against such beings.  But that doesn't work here  because there simply isn't any reason for the audience to have sympathy with the invaders.

That said, there's no real reason to empathize with the humans on the base either.  I couldn't name a single interesting or sympathetic character.  Most of them are simply plot cyphers, frantically shouting their lines to convey the current state of the story, and then casually killed off when they're no longer needed.  The most impressive things about the base commander are his eyebrows.

So, we lose the moral complexity of THE SILURIANS, and we also lose the great action sequences of THE SEA DEVILS.  THE SEA DEVILS had some great stunt work done by the HAVOC team.  Great battle sequences, some decent special effects (when used sparingly).  But twelve years later, that aspect of the production looks far worse.  The special effects are heavily based on the level of electronic effects that were state-of-the-art for the BBC in the 1980s.  They therefore have aged far worse than the simple but effective explosive charges and physical special effects of the 1970s.

The choreography of the battle sequences also leaves something to be desired.  That is to say, there isn't any.  As Peter Davison points out in the DVD extras, the two opposing armies simple stand in a line and shoot at each other.  It looks absolutely ridiculous.  There's no tension.  No menace from the monsters.  The viewer simply has to wait for a battle to end before the next scene can begin.

These Doctor Who DVDs are always loaded with extras but apart from the great commentary track, even those extras seemed a little on the dull side.  Unlike other DVD documentaries where the participants seem amused by some of the production flaws (such as portions of the documentary on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ARC-OF-INFINITY/dp/B000TSTEOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ARC OF INFINITY</a>&nbsp;DVD concerning the design of the big chicken monster), everyone still seems to be a little stunned to realize that they were part of this story.  There's no joy had in revisiting the past; they all just seem annoyed they had neither the time nor the budget to do the show properly.

That said, the DVD commentary track is great, partially because the static battle sequences and boring dialog on screen allows the participants to go off on interesting tangents.  Peter Davison talks about his decision to leave the show after three years (the was the first story he made after that decision, and he probably felt vindicated).  Janet Fielding, Peter Davison and script editor Eric Saward discuss some of the good and most of the bad things about producer John Nathan-Turner's approach to the show without sounding bitter or insulting.  Visual effects designer Mat Irvine attempts to keep the focus on what's actually appearing on the screen, and then spends a lot of time explaining what exactly was up with the Myrka.

This serial was not well received when it was made and time has not been kind to it.  As a sequel it completely fails to recapture what made the originals fun.  What do you get if you take two previous stories and remove everything that was great  about them?  The answer is you get a lot of extras in the same type of rubber suits that came before, but not much else.",1217721600,4,6325,5.412065439672801
3356525,3,B00142UZ9O,"Over the many decades of its existence, Doctor Who has always been a show full of ideas--almost endlessly inventive and creative. ""Warriors of the Deep"" is no different. What a fantastic idea, bringing back the Silurians and the Sea Devils! The basic concept of this story brims with excellent potential and fantastic possibilities. All of which gets tanked like the Titanic by inept realization and shoddy production, sad to say.

What could've gone wrong? The Silurians and the Sea Devils, reptilian Earthlings from before the age of humankind who want their planet back, definitely count as some of the more intriguingly original and complex foes (one can't really say villains per se) from the era of the Third Doctor. Now more than a decade and two Doctors later, surely their tale can be developed in new ways. And to some degree ""Warriors of the Deep"" does indeed manage gestures in this direction, giving them individual names and personalities, revealing little aspects of their society and politics, and alluding to their ethical systems and life philosophies. On a different level, furthermore, those subtle but vaguely noticeable hints of a Cold War allegory wafting about before in the Silurian/Sea Devil stories by Malcolm Hulke are here cleverly brought vividly to the foreground by Johnny Byrne. He rephrases the conflict as that between two (wisely unnamed) competing human power-blocs in 2084, a conflict the reptilians intend to capitalize upon by hijacking an undersea station and provoking both sides to destroy each other, leaving the Earth all for themselves again. In 1984 such a ""mutually assured destruction"" premise was sure to get a viewer's attention, no doubt about it. And it still has something to say yet.

But whenever you bring back old foes there's always the risk of diminishing returns, and that's what happens here. All the moral complexity of the human/reptilian conflict is glossed over rather than actually portrayed and explored as it was before. It's taken for granted, really, and you have the Doctor ranting about how nice and civilized the Silurians are to his companions and the other (realistically unlikable) humans on the military sea-base, but so far all this story has in actuality shown them doing is being sneaky, mean, and nasty. In a misplaced attempt at continuity, the Silurians claim that twice before they offered the hand of peace to the humans and aren't inclined to do so again. This is a gross misrepresentation and oversimplification of the prior two stories that we are apparently meant to take at face value--a vast proportion of those stories' greatness owes itself to the fact that inevitable tragedy was brought about by aggressive and narrow-minded individuals on BOTH sides. To put all the blame on the humans and absolve the reptilians sounds sophisticated at first but in the end vastly mutes the intriguing moral dilemma involved (as well as being just factually wrong). To add insult to injury, the Silurians' ethical justification for triggering genocide is the most laughably contorted heap of mendacious sophistry imaginable, but again we're clearly meant to take it seriously--the Doctor, our compass of right and wrong here, listens to it all without so much as a blink or sarcastically wry smile. In short, the whole conflict driving the plot is unsatisfying and unconvincing, sinking the overall story like lead. Clunk.

A million other things go wrong with the actual production, and it would try the patience of this reviewer and any hapless readers to list them all. The extras go into them in hilarious detail, anyway. An important point key to the story though would be the actual costumes for the Silurians and Sea Devils: they look cooler and more realistic, and even have some animatronic eyelids, but something about their design is obviously more hindering than the earlier ones in the 1970's so that the reptilian characters come across as far less agile and realistic in their actual movements, making the battle scenes almost embarrassingly laughable--don't expect one of these Sea Devils to die with a back flip like in 1972. Anyway, and speaking of Cold Wars, Karl Marx might as well have been referring to ""Warriors of the Deep"" when he quipped that history repeats itself, first as tragedy and then as farce.

P.S. I know, I know, I keep referring to the two prior stories featuring Silurians & Sea Devils ad nauseum, but those classics and this DVD can all be obtained in one conveniently nifty package:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Beneath-The-Surface-Doctor-Who-And-The-Silurians-The-Sea-Devils-Warriors-Of-The-Deep/dp/B0013XZ6T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Beneath The Surface (Doctor Who And The Silurians / The Sea Devils / Warriors Of The Deep)</a>.",1213401600,5,4826,5.296344647519582
3356526,5,B00142UZ9O,"Honestly, this Doctor Who story should have been one of the first of Peter Davison's Doctor Who's to be released to DVD.  I rank this one right up there with Earthshock (which I think is his overall best story) and The Visitation.

The Silurians and Sea Devils, together, return in a future Earth time period for the magnificent Doctor Who story ""Warriors of the Deep."" Their previous experience with humans has taught them that the human race can not be trusted. They decide they have no alternative but to wipe out humanity once and for all in order to reclaim the world they once called home.

To do so, they assault and take over an undersea missile base to start a nuclear war that will destroy the ""ape-primitives"" with their own weapons.  This compelling story gives Peter Davison a chance to shine as a dramatic actor, with the Doctor not sure who he is more angry with-the Silurians or the humans. Especially since in a sub-story, human agents from a rival power have also infiltraited the sea base and unleash murder and treachery even amongst the Silurian and Sea Devil onslaught.

I really liked the fact that many of the human characters in the story, even some of the so-called good guys, were not really all that likeable.  They were cranky, irritable, stubborn, and very quick to threaten force on the Doctor and his friends to get them to cooperate.  Which makes total sense for characters who have been stuck in an undersea military base for months on end and are now under attack by unknown forces.

I also really liked the sets in this story.  It seems they really put a lot of time, energy, effort, and money into making the setting really look like a futuristic undersea base.  Right down to large water tanks for reactor coolant, which they use quite well in the story.

Ultimately, the Doctor is forced to make a choice-either destroy the Silurians and Sea Devils or let them slaughter all of humanity? This is despite the fact that the Doctor sympathizes with the Silurians and knows the history of their disastrous encounters with humanity in the past. When the Doctor finally makes his choice, his feelings could best be summed up in the Doctor's own simple, yet heartbreakingly spoken words, ""there should have been another way.""",1208476800,4,2257,4.717557251908397

It's a pity the weaker parts detract because the potential was there for an all time great. On balance, then, it's a good story where you have to overlook some flaws. If you can accept that Dr Who had a lot of rubbery monsters, not always convincing (and this story is hardly alone... just think of Invisible Enemy, Invasion of the Dinosaurs or Creature from the Pit) and some poor visual effects scenes, but the reason to watch for adult viewers was the characters and story, then Warriors of the Deep is a case in point. Watch for Peter Davison who is terrific here. His Doctor is in an unusual position in this story. He's feeling guilty about the past encounters with the Silurians, he feels he let them down on some level and he's keen to redeem himself, to make amends. He wants to avoid bloodshed, he is keen to find a peaceful solution and gets angry at humans when they seem too trigger happy. But, crushingly for the Doctor, it turns out the Silurians here are even more Hell bent on war and destruction than ever! And the Doctor's realization that he has no choice, that he must fight and kill, is quite heart breaking. His despair at the end is very real. I'm always left with an angry, bitter feeling that there are people like these Silurians who just won't listen to reason and that there really should be a better way than death and destruction. Davison and the character of the Doctor shine through the uneven, often stagey production standards.",1486080000,,1550,4.539285714285715
