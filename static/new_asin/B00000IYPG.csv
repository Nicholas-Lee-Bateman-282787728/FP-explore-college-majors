The first couple of times I used each of these tapes, I gave my rewind button a pretty good workout.  THen again, I know I'm pretty uncoordinated.  Also, his directions are ""off"" sometimes (he'll say left when he means right), and the people he has working out behind him are terrible.  But, overall, the tapes are fun and challenging-- and you don't feel like you're just doing another aerobic tape, since the host really puts emphasis on how these moves work as self-defense.",1119398400,,567,4.755102040816326
8259023,5,B00000IYPG,"I have become somewhat of a workout video junkie and Silk's quickly has become one of my favorites.  I did the beginner video for the first time last night and really enjoyed it!  Silk is funny and easy-going, not annoying like some of the other instructors.  He begins with instructions on all kicks and punches included in the video set.  Silk then encourages you to rewind if there was something you didn't understand.  It's a great workout and only 30 min. long, so it's easy to fit in!  Not to mention...as scary as he looks on the box...he's a hottie!",1041984000,,557,4.52
