8056999,1,B00093GKK2,"Just learn how to speak 101 words just that.  No combination or how to use them.  I'm intermediate Italian speaker and this DVD is useless.
Not recommended.",1310428800,,156,4.7407407407407405
8057000,5,B00093GKK2,We have both the French and Italian of this series. Easy to learn. Gives the basics for the casual traveler.,1179792000,2,108,4.45
8057001,1,B00093GKK2,"This DVD is of limited usefulness because of its extreme limitation. 101 words/phrases will do little for you in Italy; I knew several hundred of them and still had great difficulty on my last trip to Italy.  When I read Italian 101 I was thinking of a proper course, covering the topics shown with real life situations.",1136592000,5,320,4.614035087719298
8057002,5,B00093GKK2,I am a Spanish teacher and bought this company's Spanish DVD.  I had a problem with it and e-mailed them.  They sent me a replacement DVD overnight free of charge and also gave me an Italian DVD free.  Then they e-mailed me the very next day to make sure I had received everything.  They e-mailed again two days later to ask if the DVD I received had worked (it did).  This DVD is very simple and basic but if you want to start learning a new language it is a good place to start.  But if you want to become fluent in a language then you need to speak it with someone.  Nothing will replace a real live person.,1124064000,9,610,4.07563025210084
8057003,4,B00093GKK2,"This DVD was very helpful getting me started learning to see some Italians really speak Italian.  It is so hard to learn how to speak or hear foreign words from only a book.  The DVD is very nicely produced.  The speakers are nice looking and it has nice music and is easy to use.  I'm not sure why someone gave it a poor review for only teaching 100 basic words, when the DVD is clearly designed to only teach 100 basic words.  Personally, I have books, tapes, computer CD-ROMs, and this DVD and I still struggle learning Italian.  And I'm Italian!! This DVD is very well done even though it is basic.  If you are just starting to learn Italian, it's good.",1124064000,19,657,4.336065573770492
8057004,1,B00093GKK2,"I had such hopes for this to brush up on my italian and learn a few more phrases, but be wared ! it has only one hundred words, no phrases, its basic beyond basic, and I have used lang tapes for years.",1123027200,8,201,3.8095238095238093
