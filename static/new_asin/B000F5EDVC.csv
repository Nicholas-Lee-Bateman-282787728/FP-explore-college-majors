2551988,5,B000F5EDVC,we love all the songs. 8-month old watches all the time. very gentle -- STILL not sick of the songs. great video (love the Christian Theme and wasn't expecting it),1261785600,3,163,4.466666666666667
2551989,4,B000F5EDVC,"Good old fashioned fun with kids singing, our daughter will mimic the actions of the kids on the video. she loves the bumblebee song, which is why I purchased this to begin with.",1257811200,7,178,4.424242424242424
2551990,2,B000F5EDVC,"There are a lot of great songs on this DVD. My toddler enjoys it, HOWEVER... it's a bit cheesey.  I wish I could find a DVD where the kids or adults did the correct hand motions to the ""fingerplay"" songs instead of dancing around or making up new actions.",1242345600,6,255,4.204081632653061
2551991,5,B000F5EDVC,"Cedarmont DVDs are the best. All children should be able to view these. If you have only a few DVDs to buy for your child then you will  not make a mistake with Cedarmont. I bought at least 12..(if you don't find all of them with Amazon, then you'll have to order from their actual website which is a little more expensive) Of all the DVDs from Cedarmont, I think the Action Songs series were my daughter (and mine..hehe) favorites. They make Action Bible Songs, and Action Toddler Songs---both excellent...but then again, get the others

Excellent product.",1171152000,27,557,4.731958762886598

2551997,3,B000F5EDVC,In  my own opinion I found  one  song  Bill  Groban  Goat  a little  disturbing  especially  for young  children. I  think  that  song  is inappropriate  for  small  children ..,1482019200,,177,4.714285714285714
2551998,5,B000F5EDVC,"I actually love that these DVDs are ""outdated"". The children look and act like children. I appreciate the absence of overstimulating animation, and the songs are wonderful classics. My 18 month old is repeating almost everything she hears, and I love knowing that these DVDs will help her to learn and repeat age appropriate lyrics and biblical songs. My little one was sick for a week, and the only thing that calmed her were these DVDs. I had zero guilt playing them on repeat. My one critique is that I wish they had included more children of color in every song. I do think they made an honest effort to have a diverse cast. I noticed that they have a gospel edition, and their newer DVDs have a more diverse cast.",1481068800,3,718,4.488549618320611

2552010,2,B000F5EDVC,"I had read many good comments regarding the Cedarmont Kids that I went ahead and purchased this DVD for my 19 month old grandson. I can't remember much about it, except that I found it so grating on my nerves that I shut it off fairly soon into the recording. Also my grandson, who loves such DVDs as LeapFrog and PraiseBaby showed no interest in this particular DVD.",1425772800,2,367,4.411764705882353
2552011,5,B000F5EDVC,I bought this for my great granddaughter.  We had a VHS tape left from the grandchildren.  We still have a player so she wanted to listen to it all the time.  She loves this one also.  I cannot tell you how many times it's been played since we got it.,1424736000,2,251,3.96

2552015,4,B000F5EDVC,My 2 year old daughter lives these videos and will always ask to see them. I know it's good wholesome fun and don't have to be worried what she is watching. She loved to sing along. This is our 3rd dvd,1420416000,2,201,3.926829268292683

2552019,2,B000F5EDVC,"I bought this DVD with the hopes that my daughter and I could learn songs/actions to sing together. It is an OK dvd I guess, but only a few of the songs have the children in the video doing actions actions, even very popular songs that most people do actions to, the children in the video just sing. Also, the majority of the songs on this video are Church songs.  I didn't mind that (it just wasn't what I was expecting because this company does other DVD that are advertised as specifically church songs) but very few of these church songs had actions to it!",1395100800,,560,4.333333333333333
2552020,5,B000F5EDVC,"My daughter is obsessed with this whole series.  The kids voices are sweet and not annoying.  They sing, dance and do motions.  My one complaint is that some of these are not toddler songs, maybe older kid songs though.  Nonetheless, my daughter loves this DVD and could care less if some of the songs are harder to sing to or not.",1393891200,,331,4.377049180327869
2552021,5,B000F5EDVC,This has been one of the best for my grandchildren ranging in age from 2 to 8.  They sing along and try the movements.,1393545600,,118,3.9166666666666665
2552022,5,B000F5EDVC,The kids really love music. This dvd engages them in active dance. I would recommend Cedarmont Kids dvds to anyone with young children.,1393545600,,135,4.913043478260869
2552023,5,B000F5EDVC,My son has autism and just loves these.  I think it is because there are children singing and dancing to the songs!,1392163200,,115,4.2272727272727275
2552024,1,B000F5EDVC,This is not a sing along and it was difficult to understand what was being sung. I would not recommend it.,1386633600,,106,4.095238095238095
2552025,5,B000F5EDVC,"Great DVD with a lots of children's songs. It is old, so don't expect great graphics. The songs themselves are timeless and hold my children's attention.",1383004800,2,153,4.923076923076923
2552026,2,B000F5EDVC,"My wife and I bought this for our almost two year old granddaughter.  We already have the Action Bible Songs dvd, which she loves.  In that one, the children are playing and doing things that are fun and that other kids like to watch. Like jumping on trampolines, climbing ropes, swinging, and sliding. This one however, is not near as good.  The kids mostly stand or sit through the songs.  Where is the action? While it shows kids at a park, they are just standing around on the equipment and not using it!  While some of the songs are nice, it could not hold her attention. Maybe the older kids won't mind watching other kids singing like their in a choir. But I can't say it's a lively action video. I gave it two stars because it's cheap and I think the producers heart is in the right place.  I will try one of there other videos and hope for the best!",1380844800,6,858,4.265432098765432

2552028,5,B000F5EDVC,"Our special grand daughter (4 yrs old) does not make sentences, but she can sang some of the words in the songs. She loves music and even watching musicians play instruments. These DVD's have kept her entertained, which is easier on her and especially us. Sure rather watch the ones that has movements of children in them.",1370390400,2,322,4.666666666666667
2552029,1,B000F5EDVC,"This DVD is horrible!  The songs are unfamiliar and the music is terribly cheesy.  The camera person and editor must have had a field day trying out every single option on their video camera.  This looks like something I would find on youtube.'
The 4-5 star commenters must be employees or the makers of this DVD.  There is no way  anyone would give this such a high review unless they were part of the production.",1364947200,,414,4.466666666666667
2552030,1,B000F5EDVC,"Should NOT be titled as an ""Action Songs"" DVD.  Out of the 16 songs there are 4 that include actions and they are horrible! I'm a music therapist and this is probably the WORST selection of ""children's songs"" I've ever seen.  Songs aren't even familiar to an adult much less a child.  There are many many real action songs for children that could have been used. If the songs would have been listed to view before purchasing I would've never purchased it as I know they are not action song.  Extrememly disappointing. Total waste of money.",1323820800,4,539,4.583333333333333
2552031,3,B000F5EDVC,The songs and singing are good. The lip movement could be better to match the singing. Otherwise it is ok.,1314662400,3,106,4.35
2552032,5,B000F5EDVC,"My kids have been watching these for years.  They know many of the old-fashioned songs and the new ones too, because of these videos!  This one, in particular, is newer than the others.  My kids don't see the difference, of course.  They don't mind the ones made in the '90's!

This is not an instructional video of the 'fingerplay' games and motions to the songs, it is 'real kids' who have been instructed-following along to the songs.

Strangely, my girls (2,4 and 6) don't often pick these out of the video line-up, but once I have one in-they all plop down on the couch to watch to the very end.  The video is a good length, and I love the songs with a christian message mixed throughout.  And, I believe that Steven Curtis Chapman's kids are featured in this particular video!",1310083200,7,782,4.49645390070922
2552033,2,B000F5EDVC,This dvd is great but for older kids. My 2 year was not very interested in it cause the music was mellow and not exciting for her.,1304035200,2,130,3.8518518518518516
2552034,1,B000F5EDVC,"Old fashioned, cheesy, and my toddler won't even watch it -- and he'll watch anything with singing and dancing. Not nearly enough dancing or actions as advertised. I wanted him to be able to dance along, but it won't hold his attention. Would not buy any DVD in this collection again until brought into a contemporary decade.",1303603200,3,325,4.719298245614035
2552035,5,B000F5EDVC,"I bought this for my grandkids who are both experiencing language delay. Not only
does it seem to be helping them say more words, but they love it!  Especially my
four year old.  I also noticed how whenever he is upset, he likes to play his
""bumble bee"" music (the object of the first song).  I ordered more DVDs.",1293667200,10,313,4.271186440677966

8117612,1,B000F5EDVC,"Yikes. This DVD does not have follow-along movements for the songs as the title suggests. It's a video of a group of kids singing the songs throughout. Also, about 1/2 of the songs are Christian/church songs so be forewarned. The product description did not include that little tidbit and absolutely should. Again...yikes.",1496707200,,322,5.211538461538462
