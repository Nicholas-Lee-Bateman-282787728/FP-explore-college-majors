7979743,5,B000087F31,"This was one of the 1st anime movies i ever saw back in the 90's and helped turned me into the anime lover i am today.  It had a great story, the characters were cool and had alot of personality and was just very entertaining from start to finish.  I have even watched this quite a few times over the years as i never really tire of it.  A must buy",1389484800,,348,3.8732394366197185
7979744,5,B000087F31,"Whenever you watch anime, you have to expect the unexpected.  A futuristic cop drama could suddenly turn into a magical girl show and back again in the blink of an eye.  But Sukeban Deka, the story of a teenage detective who uses a government-issue yo-yo as her weapon, probably takes the prize for the most unexpected (and unappreciated) anime out there.

Based on a shoujo manga by Shinji Wada from the 1970's, Sukeban Deka (which roughly translates as ""Delinquent Detective"") is the story of Saki Asamiya, a lavender-haired teenage girl sitting in a prison cell for causing trouble at her school.  A man referred to only as The Dark Investigator offers her a deal--she can work for the police as an undercover teenage detective, infiltrating high schools and fighting crimes the police normally couldn't reach...or her mother, on death row for murdering her husband, will be executed.  As long as Saki agrees to be a detective, her mother's execution will be postponed until she can be set free.

Saki has no choice but to agree, and soon she's back on her old stomping grounds--Takaoka High School.  Unfortunately, she's not top dog anymore--the three Mizuchi sisters are the queens of this school.  Emi Mizuchi is famous for her art, but it turns out that all she does is copy other artists' work and pretend that it's her own.  Ayumi Mizuchi is treated like royalty and pretends to be very lady-like, but in fact runs a righteous extortion ring and drug trade within the school.  Reimi Mizuchi is president of the student council, but yeah, she's evil too--she ends up brainwashing all the Takahoka students into doing whatever she pleases.

Add into the mix a cute but personality-free girl named Junko who paints like an angel and keeps getting her shirt ripped off, along with Saki's would-be boyfriend, Sampei, and you have the ingredients for your a-typical early 1990's high school drama...or do we?  Sukeban Deka has some familiar school drama moments, such as the awkward first meeting between Saki and Sampei (where he declares her his goddess) and Saki and Sampei hanging out at Junko's apartment, but that's not the thrust of its two forty-five minute episodes.  The real meat of this series is when Saki starts striking back against the Mizuchi sisters and their illegal activities, using her indestructible yo-yo, fighting skills, and street smarts to dish out plenty of payback.

Even though this OVA only has two episodes, the hero characters grow, adapt, and change at a satisfying pace.  Saki turns from a wild school yard brawler to a responsible teenage detective and heroine.  Sampei shaves his head (at Saki's request--you have to see it to believe it) and is a real help to Saki in the end, along with being a good friend.  Saki's police liaison, Kyoichiro Jin, is one of those long-haired bishonen detective guys who probably inspired the characters in ""Fake,"" but takes on the role of keeping Saki grounded in reality when her anger gets the better of her.  Even Saki's principal, Numa, gets in on the action, agreeing to help the girl he once hated.

And let's not forget that there's plenty of fighting, too, and the majority of it involves Saki and her yo-yo.  Anime is known for its dramatic poses, long sweeps of the hands and feet (before a punch or kick), the shouting of attack names before you use that attack, and the colorful backgrounds that appear behind the characters as they perform said attacks.  Sukeban Deka uses all of these mainstays in its fight scenes, but not to the point to overkill.  Director Takeshi Hirota knew exactly which notes to hit on the anime keyboard, and he hits them all just right.

The character designs were adapted from the original manga by Nobuteru Yuki, who also worked on Cleopatra D.C., another favorite of mine.  Nobuteru's large eyes, long faces, and shoujo leanings all add a nice touch to the proceedings here and give Sukeban Deka a unique style that it can call its own.

Takashi Takaomi's music is a combination of synthesizers, electric guitars, some nice bass, and occasional orchestral interludes that accent each character's struggle to escape the hell their school has become.  The battle themes are particularly memorable, especially the one where Saki busts into the arcade and starts raising all kinds of hell with her karate moves and her yo-yo.

I've watched both versions of Sukeban Deka (dubbed & subtitled) and, oddly enough, I prefer the dubbed version, which features the talents of old ADV Films mainstays Amanda Winn, Tiffany Grant, Kurt Stoll, Jason Lee, and Rob Mungle.  Amanda Winn landed the role of Saki Asamiya, and she was born to play this part.  The hard edge to her voice, her screams of frustration, and her comedic timing couldn't be better.  Tiffany Grant plays Junko, and while she does an admirable job, there's little she could do to elevate this character.  Kurt Stoll takes Sampei's wackiness and off-the-wall humor to the umpteenth level and makes this character a lot more entertaining than he was in the Japanese version.  Jason Lee and Rob Mungle star as some of the heavies employed by Ayumi Mizuchi to keep Saki in line.  Even ADV producer & dub director Matt Greenfield gets in on the action as some of the obnoxious background characters.

If you're expecting an anime version of the live-action Sukeban Deka movies released by Tokyo Shock,  then you'd best look elsewhere.  The Sukeban Deka OVA remains faithful to Shinji Wada's original manga and gives us a presentation that's definitely suited for the anime style.  But don't let that deter you from picking this up, because this show has it all--action, romance, angst, drama, humor, and tragedy, all in a neat two-episode package.  So if you're in the mood for an early 90's anime flashback or just a quick, entertaining watch, look no further than Sukeban Deka.",1360540800,,5847,4.886524822695035
7979745,3,B000087F31,"Many anime series go a bit over the top in some way, either with characters that are so sweet you go into diabetic shock just watching, to amazing ways to defy natural laws.  Somehow they cna do this without destroying the entertainmetn itself.

Sukeban Deka definitely plays to that pattern, but here is the villains who are just way over the top.  Some of the James Bond villains aren't as heartless, cruel and conniving as the three sisters the heroine is sent to investigate.

The story does ahve flaws and plot holes.  The main character is convinced to return to school and investigate based on a threat to execute her mother who is on death row.  She accepts, but otehr than one later moment of doubt about the whole thing never really explores her feeligns towards the cops who are controlling her.

But for 100 minutes of show, the story holds together and is fun, if not amazing.  Worth adding if you like this kind of anime, not for lovers of mecha or magical girls as you won't find that here.",1329091200,,1005,4.513812154696133
7979746,5,B000087F31,"This is an 90's anime that only had 2 episodes which makes me mad cause in that case this should of been a movie if they won't make a series out of it with several episodes. It's the manga off of the orginial live action anime back in 1972 now animated.

A.D.Vision needs to stop rating mature animes like this 15 what are they dum.

It Saki vs the law, she ask two friends from her high to help her get her mother out of jail. This anime has a lot of action and adult situations in it.",1120521600,,486,3.9489795918367347
7979747,3,B000087F31,"I say that because to be honest, it's a cliche, by the numbers good vs evil story and there's holes you can drive a Mack Truck through. The makers tried very hard to make her an anti hero and they only sort of suceeded.

That said, watch it because Saki kicks ass and uses a yo-yo for a weapon. There are some wonderful fight scenes and she uses the yo-yo to great effect. Watch it for those. Heck, make a drinking game out of it.

I should also add that in the end, when she starts tearing up the bad guy's organization single handed, is when the animation comes into it's own.",1114819200,,578,4.151785714285714
7979748,5,B000087F31,"Excellent anime series, has 2 episodes, and WAIT! There's character development, Suffecient action scenes, AND A PLOT?!?!?

Wow! Oh yeah, and Saki Asamiya rocks in Sukeban Deka, yeah..It makes me mad how those people who made UTENA ripped off Saki's character design!!",1101859200,,268,5.380952380952381
7979749,5,B000087F31,"Ok the title makes no sense, but I suck at titles anyway. Alright Sukeban Deka is perhaps one of the best animes you'll ever see. It has all the things you'd love like action, comedy, love, good vs evil, and all that. I mean this movie is so full of emotion that it's just awesome and at times all the wacked out stunts proved to be great like the stuff you used to see in old Kung Fu, Western, and Samurai movies except it takes place in a high school, which is just so cool. Also the characters are just superb in the quality of who they are, and this goes for both good and bad guys. Also one of the major thing is that the fight scenes and action are just fantastic and hilarious at the same time for some of them. This movie has a lot to offer the viewer so this a classic that you have to see.

Hope this review was helpful.",1101686400,,830,4.0
