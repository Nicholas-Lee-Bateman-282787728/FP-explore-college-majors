3176756,4,B00180OU84,"I seen Maggie Baker, going through obstacles, being bullied around by mean girls like Liz and Camille.  Putting up with her overbearing mother who wants her to lose weight.  Maggie may not be rich, popular and spent some times bullied around by her mother played by Annie Potts and the mean girls from school.  Mostly Tara the girl who was groomed for homecoming queen and the most popular girl was quite a contender the crown.  Tara is the only popular girl who's really nice to maggie and became friends in the end. The mean girls had to nominate her as a joke, pretty soon they'll think the principal remove off her ballot and Liz's friend Tara gets the crown that belong to her. But it back fired, Maggie stayed on the ballot, got a hundred fifty signatures with her help of friends like Casey and her hot boyfriend who is a lot more popular than you think.  The mean girls tried to sabotaged the homecoming float, but Maggie still stayed and fought back.  That's the reason, why I like this movie is Nikki Blonsky song On a High and her fight to make a difference that nobody could ever do.",1254355200,,1095,4.45
3176757,4,B00180OU84,"Nikki Blonsky plays a teenage girl trying to become homecoming queen despite the fact that she isn't a ""model"" figure. She's overweight, has a overprotected mother who while having genuine care for her daughter's health, still comes off as controlling and discriminatory with her approach.
The fat-acceptance movement in America has been looking for something that best expresses the viewpoint of overlooking stereotypes, and I would say that they probably aren't going to find a better outlet or voice in their argument than this movie. Nikki plays a fat girl, but a REAL one, and yes, she DOES have a somewhat eating/snacking problem that has caused a lot of her weight, but she also does have friends who love her, does hold love for herself despite her flaws, and isn't a princess the despite the fact that she's the ""underdog."" The movie does portray her mistakes she makes with her friends and goes to show that an underdog, fat or not, does make the same mistakes anyone else does and is really no different from anyone else.
It's a cute and warm movie that people as a whole will geniunely like.",1234915200,13,1103,4.780104712041885

Desde que vi Hairspray y conoc a Nikki Blonsky me encanto. Poco despus me enter que hizo otra pelcula para TV, Queen Sized.

Despus de un tiempo, pude verla y me encanto. Ver a Nikki en otra faceta es interesante y el hecho de interpretar a un personaje que esta acomplejada por su fsico y que por azares del destino llega a ser popular con el apoyo de sus amigos, lo hace interesante.

Queen Sized es recomendable para toda la familia, con un gran mensaje.

3176759,5,B00180OU84,"This is A great movie for the whole family to watch.  Anne Potts does a great job playing an overworked, too busy, neglectful mom who pushes her teenage daughter to take care of her younger brother.  Nikki Blonsky of the movie ""Hairspray"" is the overweight, used, teen daughter who has no social life who decides to run for prom queen with the help of her friends. No thanks to her ""bad girl"" enemies in school, has more difficulties than any teenager should have to put up with.  However, this wonderfully talented young woman does prevail and does wear the crown of queen for her school.",1225843200,3,589,4.59047619047619
3176760,5,B00180OU84,This is an awesome movie.  No one had ever made a movie on this topic.  Nikki was great in this movie.  Fun movie for all.,1223337600,3,122,3.8
3176761,5,B00180OU84,This movie is a good family movie with a message.  Nikki Blonsky did an excellent job and Annie Potts was spectacular!,1219968000,5,118,4.619047619047619
3176762,5,B00180OU84,I saw this movie so many times and I'm not tired of it I'm going to watch it more times it came on time the price and shipping was really good  I love it thanks amerzon,1393113600,,168,3.6666666666666665
3176763,5,B00180OU84,"I so love this movie! It is the realest thing about how fat people feel, and yes, I am of the ""lard ass persuasion"". Damn that ""pretty face"" comment and those who use it! People complain that Maggie is a cliche of a fat person: of course she does the stereotypical things a fat girl does! Overeating when stressed, losing her temper, her against the world attitude, etc....her mother looks down on her and treats her like hired help. The torture she goes through at school and being afraid to trust the opposite sex about loving her. I love when Maggie does stand up for herself in those rare moments of the movie. Casey and Tara are her saving grace, her angels, but not everyone has that in real life. My mother was a fashion model and my father took pictures of models so imagine the scorn they had for their overweight middle child.....also, another thing: parents, don't just suddenly make a change and don't pick on your fat child. Make fitness and healthy eating a top priority the minute your child(ren) come into your life. Don't single out your fat child or humiliate them the way Maggie's mother does.",1382659200,,1112,4.565
3176764,4,B00180OU84,This is a movie that my husband has wanted for quite awhile.  This is a good movie.  I would recommend it.,1379980800,,106,4.0
3176765,3,B00180OU84,"The movie could have been a lot better. Whenever she got upset, she would run to the refrigerator, grab a gallon of ice cream and collapse into the floor. Seriously? The main character was annoying, and none of the acting was anything special. I didn't end this movie with feeling happy for the girl, and there were way too many scenes with her talking to her imaginary mother. Don't waste you time",1373846400,,398,4.541666666666667
3176766,3,B00180OU84,"Pros: I actually liked mom. She nags (just a little) but really - what is she supposed to say? ""Hey, honey, I'm glad you ate an entire pizza and snarfed on ring dings the whole night!"" But I did like the affectionate lose/lose situation moms of teens find themselves in. She buys healthy food for her daughter, invites her to join her for yoga, and tries to juggle mom duties/ employee responsibilities/ and being a woman and trying to go out and have fun.

I also liked how in her TV interview, Maggie compares ""fat haters"" to racists. There is a prejudice against the chubby.

I also like how eventually, Maggie realizes that nagging voice in her head (in her mom's body) isn't her mom at all. It's the visualization of her own bad thoughts.

Cons: Maggie isn't much of a heroine. She whines too much. ""They don't like me because i'm FAT!!!"" (uh, no, maybe they don't like you because you're too mired in a pity party). She eats too much and too obviously. Most heavy people won't eat in front of others. Most heavy people don't bawl as they're shoveling ice cream into their mouths. They use food, yes. But Maggie's food cramming and dependence on binge eating and hoarding snacks is more indicative of a serious eating disorder. One in which her mother has every right to be concerned about, imo. And teen obesity / early onset diabetes are real concerns.

Casting: Annie Potts was very good. Even Nikki Blonsky is good. I would like to ask the casting director: you do realize that folks in South Carolina have accents? Other than Potts, no one had a hint of a drawl. I'm not looking for over the top fake southern accents, but something. This could have been set in California.

It was a decent movie, a good movie to talk about with your own daughter, okay for a made for TV movie. I got it out of the library, and didn't find it a waste of time. I just wish it could have been better.",1329436800,,1892,4.425287356321839
3176767,2,B00180OU84,"I have to admit that through most of this movie I was a little annoyed. The main character, Maggie, has some serious issues with self esteem and basically has a ""poor me! I'm fat and no one likes me!"" attitude throughout most of the movie. Every scene in the movie has something to do with her thinking she is some sort of victim because she is fat. here are some ideas she expresses repeatedly through out the movie:
""You don't want me to be prom queen because I'm fat!""
""Everyone gives me dirty looks!""
""I can't wear the cool clothes because they don't have them in my size!""

The movie played out like it was supposed to be making us feel sorry for obese women because it's sooo difficult for them to find clothing in their size (Most department stores don't carry anything smaller than a size 6 in misses, but they have an entire section devoted to plus sizes. Hmmm...). Maggie repeatedly finds reason to think that EVERYTHING that happens to her is because she's fat and the other girl is skinny. It's get to the point where SHE is the one making her obesity an issue.

She is also portrayed as literally running to the fridge and scarfing down a box of ice cream and crying whenever she is upset. Her mom expresses concern that she could get diabetes, but she doesn't want to lose weight because she could be giving into the pressures of being thin.

So...it's better to be emotionally volatile and basically have an eating disorder, diabetes and a whole host of other problems, rather than just trying to lose weight because then she can't be a martyr for fat girls?

As with most Lifetime movies, there is an element of cattiness and hatred toward other women. In one scene, an obese woman says that there's a ""b*tch at the gym who stares at my thighs"" but that she thinks about the fact that her ""boobs are way bigger than hers"" and she feels better. So I guess that's how women are supposed to feel good about themselves...by trying to put down other women so they feel better?

Lifetime Movie Network has made a movie that teaches fat women have serious emotional eating problems, but that we should just ""accept"" them that way and not encourage them to change because it might make them feel bad. Oh and, all anyone cares about is how fat and skinny you are (it's waaaaay overdone in this movie). There were also only two fat girls in the entire school...lol. Obesity is MUCH more common than that now. Come on!",1309478400,,2423,4.4852607709750565
3176768,4,B00180OU84,"I picked this DVD up by mistake, as I was reaching for something else on the library DVD shelf.  When I brought it home I decided to watch it anyway, and it was a rather pleasant surprise.  The commentary this movie made was rather hard to watch, sad to see, and difficult to accept here in society.

Nikki Blonsky of 'Hairspray' fame stars as overweight high school senior Maggie Baker who was nominated for homecoming queen by the mean girls cliche at her high school.  Instead of bowing out and hiding in the corner, Maggie decides to lead the charge and become kind of a champion of the people.  She appeals to the outcast (the nerds, freaks, etc. - that is, everyone who is not directly part of or victimized by the mean girls cliche) set and, like the title and movie poster front suggest, wins the crown.  We are routing for the underdog, seeing what happens when all of us who felt like outcasts rise up and become victorious over the powers that be.

However, look past the obvious plot of the story and you will see things that you may or may not have ever experienced.  Maggie is haunted by the voice of her insecurities, that horrible demon that lingers over everything you do and say, who just happens to be in the form of her glamorous, thin mother (Annie Potts).  You see her stuffing her face with ice cream and candy and garbage, eating her feelings, trying to hide herself in food.  We have all been there at some point or another, but when something happens that makes you eat and eat and eat until it hurts.  Soon your find yourself 45 lbs heavier than you used to be, and people are telling you the same thing as Maggie's mom is ""Loose some weight and you'll be happy.""  Unfortunately, that really is the only alternative.  The world is not going to change, YOU have to change.  Maggie's weight did not budge through this movie, but she did learn to be a better person and to transform, because she hit rock bottom several times through this movie.  I would have liked to have seen what happened to Maggie after the homecoming events were over, let alone what happened to the person this story was based on.

Why not 5 stars?  The movie in general has a very adolescent tone about it.  Understandable as it is a movie about adolescents, but this could have had a more mature nature about it.  It is just as much an adult based movie as it is based on our teenage years.",1305244800,3,2390,4.403189066059226
3176769,3,B00180OU84,It was an o.k movie. But why all the scenses like she's talking to her mother.,1283126400,,78,3.9375
3176770,1,B00180OU84,"It is ironic that, though the mockery, pain, and condescension which the 'fat girl' here has to endure are utterly true, there are stereotypes reinforced which could lead to more of the same. One might think that those unaware of the abuse to which an overweight teenager can be exposed could develop some understanding from the presentation, but indeed viewers (who have not struggled with the problem) could think their criticism and misjudgement was justified and even helpful. Nikki is the stuff of prejudice - the girl with the stash of junk food under her bed, who orders and eats a whole pizza while tossing the 'healthy' meal into the rubbish bin, and so forth. As well, though there is a suggestion that her (thin) mother is nagging, judgemental and controlling, most of the words which Nikki 'hears' are in imagination - one could receive the impression that her 'caring' mother is only concerned that the girl not meet an early death from diabetes (as did her father), since the mockery of her appearance is a daydream.

Decades ago, I was an overweight teenager (though nowhere near the size of our heroine). I'd love to see a film which shows what many of us really experienced - constant struggles to lose weight, mockery of our weight loss efforts, assumptions that we were stashing junk food or eating sweets when we were not, being unable to be in the company of many people without instant criticism and condescending 'advice.' Such a film would need to include what it is actually like to have a nagging mother - I can remember my own poking me with 'is that all you?!', dressing me in dowdy dark clothes so I looked like a frumpy woman of 60, crying about her misfortune in having the fat daughter no matter how many awards I won for arts or academics. Even a simple Google search will tell anyone that (at least according to medical reports - not my own experience, since I reached a normal weight in my 50s by eliminating carboyhdrates) long-term or substantial weight loss is impossible - that no one could hope to lose more than 10 pounds, and it's impossible not to gain everything back. This film makes it implicit that the 'fat girls' stuff themselves endlessly and do no exercise, as if the slightest efforts in another direction would make them slender. A girl the size of this one could starve off 70 pounds and still be considered 'obese,' and the 25-pound weight loss about which her mother nags would not even show.

Though the film is accurate in showing utter cruelty and mockery on the part of the other prospective homecoming queen, its depiction of the main character is so unlike the situation of many other heavy women that it could inspire others to think that they are 'cruel to be kind' if they make similar assumptions.",1265673600,6,2763,4.683127572016461

Decades ago, I was an overweight teenager (though nowhere near the size of our heroine). I'd love to see a film which shows what many of us really experienced - constant struggles to lose weight, mockery of our weight loss efforts, assumptions that we were stashing junk food or eating sweets when we were not, being unable to be in the company of many people without instant criticism and condescending 'advice.' Such a film would need to include what it is actually like to have a nagging mother - I can remember my own poking me with 'is that all you?!', dressing me in dowdy dark clothes so I looked like a frumpy woman of 60, crying about her misfortune in having the fat daughter no matter how many awards I won for arts or academics. Even a simple Google search will tell anyone that (at least according to medical reports - not my own experience, since I reached a normal weight in my 50s by eliminating carboyhdrates) long-term or substantial weight loss is impossible - that no one could hope to lose more than 10 pounds, and it's impossible not to gain everything back. This film makes it implicit that the 'fat girls' stuff themselves endlessly and do no exercise, as if the slightest efforts in another direction would make them slender. A girl the size of this one could starve off 70 pounds and still be considered 'obese,' and the 25-pound weight loss about which her mother nags would not even show.

Though the film is accurate in showing utter cruelty and mockery on the part of the other prospective homecoming queen, its depiction of the main character is so unlike the situation of many other heavy women that it could inspire others to think that they are 'cruel to be kind' if they make similar assumptions.",1265673600,6,2763,4.683127572016461

8268233,5,B00180OU84,This is a great movie to help build self esteem in girls in high school that are overweight. I was teased and bullied all through school because I was overweight. The only downside is that they always seem to make that all big people do is stuff food in their mouth and that is why they are big. That is not always the case.,1481241600,,324,4.078125

8268236,1,B00180OU84,"The message of and casting for this movie totally miss the mark.  I think this was supposed to be about overcoming obstacles and winning ""queen"" because of ""inner beauty"" - problem is, Nikki Blonsky's character has none.  She's selfish and self-centered and takes her amazing, supportive mom for granted, as well as her best friend, who is selfless and loyal to the point of absurdity.  Blonsky's perpetual pity party leaves no room for her poor widowed mom's struggles to work 'round the clock and give her kids everything she can.  A polite and sympathetic comment about money troubles causes Blonsky to throw a tantrum and basically accuse her mom of not wanting to buy her a dress.  Her mom takes the abuse like a saint; if she were my kid I'd not be spoken to that way.  Weight is the least of this girl's issues - how about a new personality and some compassion for those trying their best to support you.

Funny enough, Tara - the conventionally- pretty homecoming shoe-in - is brimming with inner beauty and is selfless and sympathetic, and an academic superstar to boot.  One of my least favorite scenes takes place between Tara and Blonsky's character towards the end of the movie, in which Tara makes the awkward analogy that, like Blonsky being pigeonholed for her weight, Tara's been pigeonholed for being the ""pretty girl.""  The actress rolls her eyes as she delivers these lines as if she knows how ridiculous of a comparison this is.

If you like whining and pity-parties and mom-bashing and nonsensical messages about what it reallyyy meansss to be homecoming queen, you will love this movie.",1447891200,,1609,4.797101449275362
