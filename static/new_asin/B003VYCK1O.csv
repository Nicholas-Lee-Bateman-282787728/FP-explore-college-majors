8407206,5,B003VYCK1O,"Very well put together and extremely informative.  I'm sure at one time I knew most of what was on the DVD, but a refresher is always helpful.  I do wish it had gone beyond Clinton.",1300579200,,181,4.142857142857143
8407207,5,B003VYCK1O,"Mike Wallace is excellent in bringing a summary of political truth to light on 10 past presidents, their families, actions, and their policies. Outstanding, at a level for upper elementary to adult with continual live footage of the events presented, as seen on CBS when it happened. The episodes of the hindsight on huge political events were aired first on A&E and the History Channel and have their excellence of production level. This is outstanding, 5-star educational material. For those of us old enough to have lived through most of those presidents, it is worthy of 6-stars, the additional star for nostalgia. You will relive the moments, good and bad.

This series should be on every school shelf, usable in any 20th Century US &/or World History class. This DVD set would augment any US Government textbook, and provide a visual learning experience for school students and those adults who just enjoy a life of continued mental stimulation. History & Politics buffs: right up your alley. See reports by Murrow, Cronkite, Mudd, and more. More fun than election night!
SUBTITLES are available for all episodes. Bonus includes a viewer's booklet with added information related to each episode, and text material on the discs about political people and their life after the highlighted events.

Each episode is between 45 & 50 minutes, plenty of color (but some older film segments used are B&W), and quite family appropriate. My wife joined me in rating ""20th Century Politics & Presidents"" a TOP DVD set. Hooked after episode one, we did not want to stop watching.
