7817494,5,6301960173,"I totally think this movie rocks. Yes it is cheesy,but it is a really good movie. Personally I think the only good thing about the first one was the Romons and that is it. I would really like to see this movie on DVD.",1092009600,3,217,3.9545454545454546

7817497,4,6301960173,"Do you like fun?  I know I certainly do.  This movie is something to sit back to and let the good times roll...ROCK and roll that is!
To tell you the truth, I didn't appreciate this movie until I saw the original Rock and Roll High School.  The soundtrack is really the only good thing about the first film.  This one, the second, is the winner.
You see, it has all these really great characters that are fun to love!  For instance, the Bumbling Security Guards, the creepy witch girl (who sadly doesn't get enough play), the hot substitute teacher, the punk rock girl, and...and...best of all- COREY FELDMAN- The un-official God of Campy!
The film is shamelessly bad.  It's directed badly, the shots are horrible, and the music is tasteless.  But that, my friends, is a recipe for hilarity.  If you like any b horror films, you should have no problem with this.
It's all the things you wanted to do in highschool.  It's all the fashions you wanted in the 80's- and all the snapshots you burned 5 years later.
One highlight of this masterpiece is the Mojo Nixon cameo, he sings a song in a dream sequence, and utters words of wisdom never matched by any philosopher, living or dead.
To conclude, I suppose it's rather confusing that I at once call this movie bad and a masterpiece.  To clarify, this movie is a cheesy, kitsch highschool fantasy.  If you like cheesy humor, you'll love this.
It's a feast of all the hilarious badness of Driver's Ed videos and after-school specials.  It's a lot of fun, so sit back and enjoy it, and afterwards, put on your Breakfast Club soundtrack for a complete melt down of 80's bliss.",1026259200,3,1621,4.5326460481099655
7817498,5,6301960173,"Rock and Roll High School Forever is the sequal to Rock and Roll High School starring the Ramones.  This movie has a cheese factor of five stars as well, but it is funny enough and the songs are cool enough to keep  interest, the referances to Star Wars and Heart of Darkness were rather  amusing as well.  If you like B-class cult movies, this is where to be!",958003200,5,360,4.25
7817499,5,6301960173,"Corey Feldman was great in this movie (though he is in every movie) even though he was on drugs through most of it. Me being a devoted fan to Corey Feldman, liked this movie cause it was also a goo movie beyond the fact  that he is in it. So enjoy this movie-Manda",956966400,,264,3.981132075471698
