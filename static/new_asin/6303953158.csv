1176006,4,6303953158,"This was the first Manga-movie I bought. I had some money left in my wallet that I didn't know what to do with, so I bought ""TOKYO BABYLON"". I had been interestet in manga-anime-movies before but I had  never bought one before.  When I got home i slottet the movie (VHS) in to  the player. I was about to witness the best anime-movie I've almost ever  seen. This is the beginning of a trilogy that you will never forget. This  movive is just the great start of a super trilogy. You won't regret that  you've seen this. The colors are sharp and clean, short said,  extra-ordinary. =) Everythings fits, and works just as in a real good  manga, the story line is great... SE THIS MOVIE..",957571200,,684,4.373015873015873
1176007,4,6303953158,"Of course, what less could you expect from our favorite manga ladies? This anime is a delicious taste of something a little different and if you see it you'll know what I mean. It's a shame there isn't more anime of this  series to be seen, but you can always pick up the Japanese mangas if you're  hungry for more. :)",947980800,,318,4.19672131147541
1176008,5,6303953158,"Tokyo Babylon is a magnificent, heartbreaking CLAMP story (and a personal favorite) about young Subaru Sumeragi, his twin sister, Hokuto, and their friend, Seishiro Sakurazuka.  Together, the three explore Tokyo City,  commenting upon the hypocritical and unthinking masses and the damage group  mentality can cause the individual.  Subaru Sumeragi, as an onmyouji (a  Japanese medium and exorcist), is privy to things that a normal sixteen  only imagines.  In Tokyo Babylon, Subaru is the protagonist of a tale that  interweaves an existentialist Tokyo with traditional Japanese mysticism.
Unfortunately, the seven-volume CLAMP manga series will probably never  be commerically released in the United States, as it is primarily a  societal criticism with some male-male romantic underpinings between  Seishiro and Subaru.  Combining the knee-jerk reaction in the US toward any  suggestion of homosexual romance and the culture-bound nature of the  criticism makes for a story that is unlikely to sell.  However, the anime  demonstrates neither of these (despite the cover art's insinuation), so  this two-part anime certainly the most assessible manner in which to enjoy  Tokyo Babylon.  Unlike many anime OVA series based upon manga titles, the  anime comprises original stories, which, incidentally, were not created by  CLAMP.
The first volume details Subaru's confrontation with Negumo, a  young businessman with uncanny good luck that seems to leave anyone in his  way dead.  After Negumo's luck leads to the death of a colleague, the man's  sister seeks revenge, using spiritual means that endangers everyone.  Subaru must help this woman, but how can he reach a woman in deep  mourning?
In the second volume, Subaru witnesses a grisly murder on the  subway.  A postcognitive woman also witnesses the murder with her powers,  and Subaru immediately feels a connection to her.  Caught up in a  horrifying web of murder and madness, Subaru is forced to meet the serial  killer face to face.  This episode also includes a beautifully interpreted  animation of the famed ""Sakura Barrow"" scene.
Thus, though the  anime contains many of the surface features and motifs of the CLAMP  creation, it lacks much of the depth and passion that made Tokyo Babylon so  great.  For example, in both parts 1 and 2, Subaru needs physical rescuing.  In the manga, he is a onmyouji of great competence and professionalism;  when he needs rescuing, it is typically from himself, not others.
Also,  the anime is open-ended.  None of the underlying story arcs are resolved or  explained.  US Manga Corps changed the dub significantly to try to resolve  these issues, undoubtedly appalling purists, but, in the sub, the ambiguity  has been preserved.  In either case, though the complex relationship  between Seishiro and Subaru is sublimated and not at all well-represented.  This relationship between the two is explained and developed in another  CLAMP title, X.  For this reason, this anime is a must for those familiar  with X (X/1999 in the US).
Why, then, is the series called, ""Tokyo  Babylon""?  Such a question is not necessarily made clear even upon  repeated viewings of the videos but is essential to truly understanding the  story. The title is a metaphor, likening the city of Tokyo to the Biblical  city of Babel and criticizing the hubris of the modern populace. Their  selfishness and arrogance is compared to the purity and innocence of  Subaru.  The Tokyo of the anime is dark and oppressive; buildings loom high  overhead, threatening those under them and people brush past without a  second glance.
Nonetheless, the Tokyo Babylon anime is a delightful  story, subtle and impressive.  It has a provocative, if disturbing message,  one that will surely move any who take the time to view it.  I highly  recommend it to anime lovers interested in a story that transcends  super-powered robots and big-breasted women and definitively label it a  must for all CLAMP fans.",945907200,76,3970,5.221690590111643
1176009,5,6303953158,This was a very well writen and animated pair of stories. The DVD is a great format to buy this in because it allows you the flexability of watching it in Japanese with English subs or English Dubbed. The voices  used in both cases were quite good. This story keeps you glued to the set.  It has enough action to hold your attention and more then enough story to  keep you intellectually  stimulated.

1176010,5,6303953158,"This series is true to the characters and watchable by both the fans of the original 'comic' and of the beautiful animation. The voices in Japanese are supurb, and the story is dramatic. I highly recommend this series.",939945600,,218,4.7631578947368425
1176011,5,6303953158,"Any fan of CLAMP will enjoy these two side stories to their intricate ""TOKYO Babylon"" manga series (the forerunner to the more complex 'X' series). While the major underlying plot line will be lost on those who  haven't read the manga (a common problem in many anime OAV series), the  stories stand very well on their own and present the characters true to  form.
The first story deals with a young woman's attempt to avenge her  brother's murder by conjuring a dangerous Dog Demon and what happens when  it gets out of hand. The second tells the story of a young woman who's  psychic ability to ""see"" the recent events surrounding any object  she touches makes her the target of a psychotic serial killer loose in the  Tokyo subways.
Both stories run much like murder-mystery drama programs  and provide plenty of suspense and fantastic occult events. Those who know  the characters of Subaru, Hokuto, & Seishiro will enjoy their  involvement, but don't expect anything more than vague references to the  complex events & relationships that surround these characters from the  manga. All in all, a good reflection on the series and the artists.",939859200,3,1145,4.870466321243524
1176012,2,6303953158,"When I found this DVD, I was thrilled. I am a HUGE fan of the 7 part manga series and expected this to be the same. However, I was wrong. While this DVD has an interesting plotline and the same three main characters: Subaru, Seishiro, and Hokuto, it chops up the original story from the manga and distorts it in a weird way.

Now, I did like some of the elements of it (example: the relationship between Mirai and the older man. I found that sweet), but I rather liked the ending of the manga and was hoping they would cover it.

If you are a fan of the manga, I would advise to stay away from this DVD. It is not flattering.",1137369600,,625,4.073170731707317

I won't bother with a dvd review here; the reviewers on the other dvd's page captured its essence perfectly.

Needless to say, this OVA has an excellent few side-stories to the manga. However, as far as I can tell, the only difference between the two dvds is the color of the cover.",1126742400,12,473,4.552941176470588
1176014,4,6303953158,"Tokyo Babylon is one of Clamps best, if not the best, works. It is about a 16 year old boy named Sumeragi Subaru who is an onmyoji (or medium, as they say in the American version), who  takes on jobs dealing with the supernatural (curses, spirits, that kind of thing). His sister, Hokuto and his friend Seishiro, accompany him throughout the series.

In the first episode, Subaru has to confront a businessman trying to make his way to the top of a company with mysterious deaths surrounding him. In the second episode, he must solve a murder case which is comitted by a guy who walks onto the subway late at night, and kills someone.

I thought that the anime was well done with a few exceptions:

1. Subaru's voice actor. He made Subaru sound like a pathetic 12 year old when in fact Subaru is powerful and strong, and yes a little childish (he is only 16). If you watch this and then X/1999, you will notice a huge change in the voice.

2. They didn't follow the storyline of the manga. this may not bother most people, but I think the manga had a very good storyline.

3. The annoying theme song. It is sung by a guy with a very nasal voice, it sounds like he has a cold.

4. No indication of Seishiro hitting on Subaru or Hokuto trying to get them together, which is just about all they talk about in the manga.

Other than that, I think it was very well done and I proudly give it 4 stars (one of my favorite anime's ever!). If you liked this, definatley watch X, and get the manga for Tokyo Babylon.",1098230400,4,1506,4.2596491228070175
1176015,4,6303953158,"I don't really understand why they called it a prelude to X the movie, but they did. This movie is about Subaru, Seishirou, and Seichiro's life before X the movie. Mostly about Subaru, the story is about Subaru as a medium and the head of his family. There are 2 Stories. The first one is about Subaru solving a case with a man who is in accidents and never gets hurt but other people do. One of the men who was killed sister wants revenge so she puts a curse on the buliding. The curse is wrong and so it goes out of control. Subaru must stop the curse and the man before more people die. The second story is about a man who kills for fun. Subaru witnesses a woman being killed by the man. A woman who also has psychic powers is involved. She has the power to touch something and immediatly see something that happened in the past. They become friends and she is targeted by the man in the train station. Subaru must find them before she is killed.

1176016,5,6303953158,"Alrighty.  Looking over a few of the other reviews, let's throw in my two-cents.
First off, DON'T DON'T DON'T watch the English version.  Oh.  My.  God.  Someone shoot me for trying to listen through the first 3 minutes of that.  Subaru's voice actor completely ruined it for me.  And scrolling forward to listen to Seishiro and Hokuto made me want to bury my head in a hole and cry.  Watch the Japanese version.  Listen to the Japanese.  Read the subtitles if you're not fortunate enough to understand it, even though a good deal of the subtitles on this DVD are actually quite wrong.  :P  It's still better than listening to that English BS.
Personally, I love the Japanese vocal representations of the characters.  Koyasu Takehito as Sakurazuka Seishiro (yes, that's the same guy that did Hotohori from Fushigi Yuugi and Hanagata from Saber Marionette J and Zechs from Gundam W and... I'll stop there) made me dance for joy.  Itou Miki did a wonderful job as Hokuto, pulling off that wonderful laugh you see splayed across the pages of the manga to what I personally think is perfection.  And Yamaguchi Kappei as Sumeragi Subaru?  *DIES*  Gaw!  Love it!  'course, can't go wrong with the guy who did Haruhiko in Please Save My Earth.
Before we go whining that Subaru sounds like a wuss, remember that he's a 16 year old introvert in Tokyo Babylon.  *happily tries to wave manga around*  He's bashful, he's blushing, he's stammering like a fool and his sister yells at him for trying to downplay himself as an 'ordinary onmyouji' (yes, that's in the comics as well as on the DVD).  So, hate to say it, but the light and soft voice fits the very pre-X Subaru pretty darned well.
I found this DVD collection fascinating due to the fact that the stories that are presented NEVER appeared in the manga - they're all original creations, yet fit in PERFECTLY with the entire mode of the Tokyo Babylon series.
Only problem that I had was that Seishiro wasn't desperately hitting on Subby every few seconds like he is in the comic book, and Hokuto wasn't nearly aggressive enough in trying to get her brother to date the 'kindly veterinarian.'
Those of you who are watching this to understand the characters in X more?  Ur, I'd say not to bother.  There's almost nothing of the bet put out, none of the tragedy that creates the Subaru of 1999 presented, and no mention of that wonderful word 'Sakurazukamori' which happens very often in the manga.
But good news for all - with the manga having been licensed, it should be coming out soon enough in English for those who don't have the patience to painstakingly translate it to enjoy!",1066608000,5,2627,4.648590021691974
1176017,5,6303953158,"I really enjoyed this DVD. I like Subaru and Seishiro from X so that is really the main reason I got TB. I watched both movies and was amazed. It was so awesome! The animation wasn't as good as X, but that's because these movies are older than X (Movie 1 1992; Movie 2 1994). I agree with what people have said about Subaru-kun's voice, to wimpy. And Subaru-kun is not a wimp. I have downloaded the first 5 volumes of the TB manga so the movies do seem to make a little more sense, dealing with Subaru-kun and Seishiro. I suggest any X fan buy this DVD, it is very awesome. I just wish it was longer *sigh*. Tokyo Babylon is now my 2nd favorite anime (X being no. 1) I love CLAMP and all of their works. I strongly suggest any X, Clamp, Subaru, Seishiro or Hokuto fan, buy this DVD. It's cool!",1062201600,3,793,4.122580645161291
1176018,4,6303953158,"Tokyo Babylon is a good portion of the anime, but sadly if you have no background whatsoever on the story (which is hard to find, unless you are able to find scans of the un-released manga, can pick up whatever you can in watching/reading X/1999, or the like) or the characters for that matter, the anime seems quite useless. I suggest finding out information beforehand in order to appreciate the anime a ton more. ^_^",1056326400,,419,4.6
1176019,5,6303953158,"For those who are calling this DVD a prologue to the X TV series.. that's not really accurate. Tokyo Babylon is NOT NEEDED to understand X, but it's nice to understand the deeper relationship between Subaru and Seishirou, and why they seem to know each other so well in the X series. Both episodes cover cases that Subaru tackles during his Onmyouji duties. The animation isn't top-notch (considering how recently it was made), but it's not painful. Watching the subtitled version is recommended, as with most anime, because Subaru's English voice actor especially wasn't at his best. If you want to really learn more about Subaru and Seishirou, you can always import the manga (untranslated when I wrote this review) because I'm sure this disc will leave you wanting more. Also take note that it does not cover a LOT of important details later in the manga, mainly how Seishirou lost his eyes, how Subaru was betrayed, why Seishirou killed-- you get the point.
Basically, occult fans, bishounen, shounen-ai fans, CLAMP fans, and mystery fans should enjoy this nice little snippit from the Tokyo Babylon saga. I personally really enjoyed this disc as a TB fan.

1176020,2,6303953158,"Ok, I LOVE Tokyo Babylon. I have all but one issue and that because my sister's friend from Japan couldn't find it :(
I have both episodes on the original language LDs, from back when they were originally released.
I'd bought the DVD released in 1999, and I was terribly disappointed, even though it was my first experience with the series.
The picture was blurry, pixilized, jumpy, and the audio was bad. From the amount of work put into making the 2 episodes look like a movie that introduces X(it doesn't) I'd say thsi is more of the same. The editing to remove japanese texts was annoying to say the least, and infuriating to say the worst.
Ithe person complaining about the voice actor was talking about the Japanese actor, Kappei Yamaguchi, I think he did a great job. He was only SLIGHTLY too wimpy, but put just the right amount of sissy into it to get across that Subaru's well, kind of a sissy(for lack of a better word. he wants to work with dogs, and play with his Best Friend, but has to do exorcisms, etc.), forced into the role of a leader. Duty VS Happiness. Angst. CLAMP!!
IF they're talking aobut the English actor, I pity you. You've heard more than 5 seconds of that BS. The script's totally different.
The best way to look at these is as movies made for fans of the manga.
The original LDs ahve interviews with the actors, and music videos.
Neither came over.
Lame.
On the Manga front, FAKE just came over. There's hope.
Oh, The eye damage comes far later, and I'll say no more. Otherwise I'll ruin everything.",1055116800,3,1531,4.4714285714285715
1176021,4,6303953158,"The first two dragons seen in the anime movie ""X"", Subaru, a Dragon of the Heaven(Ten no Ryu), and Seishiro, a Dragon of the Earth(Chi no Ryu) were at one time close friends.  This is the story before opposite forces throw them into battling each other for Earth's future.
As always, the animation is beautiful, as it is with CLAMP. If you're collecting the anime series ""X"", get this prequel to a great series... Just think of this as an OAV before X.",1048896000,5,452,4.445783132530121
1176022,4,6303953158,"I originally picked up this title because I recognised it as a CLAMP effort, and, as a huge CLAMP fan, felt obliged to. Once I bought it and read the back, I discovered it could be considered as a prelude to the X/1999 series, and was naturally thrilled. After watching it, I can't say I was disappointed.
The drawings are, like all of CLAMP's works, beautiful. While the animation between the two parts is rather different (a brief online search allowed me to find out they were made at different times) it is still superb in both. I won't rehash the stories here, as I don't wish to spoil them, but both of them are fantastic. Mostly dark, but with a sprinkling of humour (particularly from Subaru's lively sister Hokuto) and likeable characters, Tokyo Babylon is a work of art.

It's not for the faint-hearted though- it has its fair share of gore, and a little occultism, which may offend some. It is also implied throughout the two parts, the second especially, that Subaru and Seichiro are slightly more than 'best friends'. (Readers of the X/1999 manga, or people who have seen X will know what I'm talking about here.) I understand that a male/male relationship may offend some.
I really only had a few slight problems with this title:
1) There were only ever two episodes made. (I remember reading somewhere that there was also a live-action Tokyo Babylon movie made, but I don't have much hope of finding it if it exists.) I really started to get into this series, and was vaguely depressed when it was over, and I didn't have any more.
This would be an easily solved problem, if the manga was released as well. However, due to the content of the manga (same-sex pairings) I don't think we'll ever see it here. Though Tokyopop is bringing out Gravitation, and I know that Tokyo Babylon was released in France a few years ago, so maybe there is hope...
2) Subaru's English voice-actor. Sadly, he just makes Subaru sound like a wimp. I'm sure that he's a very talented person, but I don't think he tapped Subaru very well. Subaru might be young in this, and a little whipped by his sister, but we do have to remember that he is the head of one of Japan's most powerful families- his voice needed a little backbone! And don't get me started on the Japanese chanting at the start of episode one...
All in all though, this is a charming series. Aimed more at women, this title would certainly appeal to men as well though, and is an excellent addition to any anime collection. For CLAMP fans, if you don't have this, you should be ashamed of yourself.",1048550400,4,2556,4.544468546637744
1176023,5,6303953158,"Before their appearance in the CLAMP motion picture/anime series/manga X, Subaru(one of the Seven Dragons of Heaven) and Seichiro(one of the Seven Dragons of Earth) had the earlier years of their lives shown in this great occult 2-part OVA series. Here, Subaru is a psychic from a long line of spiritualists who professionally help safeguard people from supernatural occurances. His sister is also a spiritualist of sorts and has a crush on their family's longtime friend, the vet Seichiro. The fate surrounding them in X is not truly given away in the anime, and only breifly mentioned in the X movie. But Tokyo Babylon is still a great look at mysticism in modern-day Japan. The two episodes are totally seperate from each other. The first one had Subaru being called in to investigate a possible murder involving a man with extremely good luck who seems to be the only one surviving all the tragic accidents happening at his company's construction site. The second episode is much longer dealing with a psychopath on a subway, and a woman with post-cognitive powers that allow her to see into the past. The animation is great with theatrical quality and sceneric imagery. This is one of the better of CLAMP's pre-Cardcaptors stories to be done as an anime.

His legions of fangirls will not be disappointed in these OVAs. These are side stories to the manga, and while not all character relationships from the original are fully explored, this definitely gives the viewer a taste of CLAMP's universe. In both stories, Subaru investigates a baffling paranormal case, accompanied by his two sidekicks -- Hokuto, his twin sister, and Seishirou Sakarazuka, a veteranarian and fellow magician (with a dark secret that's not fully revealed in these productions -- and, BTW, his Japanese voice actor is no other than the great Koyasu Takehito!). OVA1 is about a mysterious series of murders at a construction site, a man who seems to have been ""born lucky,"" and a woman out for a grisly revenge. OVA2 concerns a psychic who can see the past through her fingers and a killer stalking the Tokyo subways. Both are well-written and suspenseful (although the story of OVA2 is more engaging), the production values surprisingly good for OVA animation of this time period, and the Japanese voice actors give terrific performances (well, hey. . . it's *Koyasu*!) However, I'd stick with the Japanese subtitled version, as the dub makes some serious script changes (some of which alter the character of Seishirou). I'd recommend this to CLAMP fans, Koyasu fans, and people who like similar types of supernatural mystery (i.e. X-Files, Yami no Matsuei).

1176028,3,6303953158,"(Maybe 2 stars -- couldn't decide)
I think a good story progressively reveals information as the story goes on. The first episode is uninspired; the villian (and nearly everything else) is given away by exposition early. There's some shallow character development with the main characters, and virtually none with the supporting characters. There's a scene where the villian loses an arm that turns into a what I can only describe as a ""demon-spirit cannon"". I found it every bit as silly and over-the-top as it sounds.
The second episode is more interesting. There's a killer who's stalking people on a subway train, so the group tries to help the police catch the killer. There's some suspicion cast on the minor characters, which makes the story's end less obvious than the first episode. If you're only going to get one of these two episodes (and you're sure you want one of them) get this one.
The costumes for the main character were out-of-place. In the first episode (and some of the second) he wears a leather bodysuit with a red jacket and broad black-brimmed hat. OK, it *is* Anime, but... Michael Jackson sprang to mind and never went away. The cross motif is overdone on the clothing in the second episode, and I'm not really even sure why a cross motif was used for mediums.
To end on a positive note, the sister is pretty funny. She plays a self-centered bratty comic relief in the transition scenes.",994636800,2,1415,4.7560975609756095

The only hint of the series' true depth in these OAVs is a brief opening sequence.  Unfortunately it's been done in such a way that will leave those who haven't read the manga scratching their heads in confusion.
Still; the animation is excellent for its time, the action is fast-paced and the OAVs stand alone much better than CLAMP's other early OAV attempt RG Veda.  It's still enjoyable... just not as much as it could have been.",994550400,4,769,4.7164179104477615

Among so much technology and so much artificial light it doesn't  seem to be space for the spirits and, nevertheless, these exist, like  Subaru and Hokuto, the Sumeragi Twins know well. Descendants of a family of  wise spiritists, the Sumeragi twins live in the biggest city of the Pacific  shore. A proud metropolis that not only boasts of having reborn from it's  own ashes but that aspirates to rule the world. A city very parallel to the  biblic Babylon. A city that seems to be waiting for some god to punish it  for it's pride and it's inhabitants 'sins. Because each one of the many  millons of citizens of Tokyo city has his dreams, his yearnings, his  anguishes and his pains. Everyone of them are easy preys of despair and  feel tempted to turn to magical methods to escape from their little dramas.  Methods that, if wrongly used, can bring about the destruction and misery  of everyone that surrounds them. Sumeragi Subaru is a young Omnyouji,  Thirteenth Head of the powerful Sumeragi Clan. His duty is to unsummon the  painful spirits that still walk the world of the living. He lives with his  twin sister, Hokuto, whose main occupation seems to laugh at his shyness  and his deep relationship with Seishirou, descendent of another ancient  family, the mysterious Sakurazuka Clan. Seishirou is also an Omnyouji,  though he dedicates his life to veterinary, and seems as well to be hidding  a darker side of his personality from the twins as romantically interested  in Subaru. But, is there any shadowy bond that links the couple appart from  their relationship?
This anime is well worth watching even for those who  haven't heard of Tokyo Babylon. The relationship between Subaru and  Seishirou is a thing to watch out and the constant annoying Hokuto adds to  the lack of humor in the anime. The plot in the anime are quite typical  though but nevertheless entertaining and thrilling. Also, this anime have a  very mild Yaoi touch to it so becareful those who don't like this stuff.",958780800,2,2228,4.7795275590551185

7902066,3,6303953158,"The artwork/animation are good, I like the visuals.
The story is basically a supernatural crime thriller, and it was an average in my opinion. Voice acting ranges from decent to annoying, atleast when it comes to the English dub. The main guy named ""Suburu"" , has the worst voice acting in this thing.

The music is not memorable, except the song that plays that sounds like a emo pop song from the 80s, it's kinda odd , and was annoying but is catchy. But the overall soundtrack isn't bad. It blended well into the background , so nothing outstanding there, but nothing bad in that category.

 Basicly, Tokyo Babylon is an okay anime film. To me, it's more of a study of the artwork than anything else, along with the fact that it's supposed to be a prequel to the X story , so it was like a collectable.

This story seriously should be remade. They could do so much with the theme and the characters, i hope CLAMP ( the team behind this) revisit this and redo it.

Anyways, I will say that this movies strength is its artwork. Next to that is the supernatural theme that mixes in crime/detective thriller. Next time I watch this I will be switch to Japanese voice dub.",1460678400,,1170,4.423255813953489

Subaru is the 13th head of the Sumeragi clan. He is hired to exorcise a construction sight. His employer mysteriously dies. The only survivor is the only suspect. Now a woman is out for revenge, saying that the man is responsible for her brother's death. Subaru must find the truth and dispel the spirits that protect the guilty party.

Episode 2
A serial killer is on the loose in Tokyo. Subaru witnesses a murder, but can't identify the killer. He meets a woman that has post cognitive ability. She is able to help Subaru and the police track down the murderer, but things get very dangerous and all involved may end up as victims as well.

This is a very different kind of anime. I got it b/c it is the back story to one of the great X characters. The 1st tale didn't do it for me at all, I was very disappointed. The 2nd story is quite good though. For an older anime, the animation is really good. The English dub is below average, but tolerable. The soundtrack is very dated. You can tell when this anime was made just by listening to the music and seeing the outfits that the characters wear. Subaru's wardrobe reminds me a lot of Michael Jackson. One thing that kind of bummed me out was that Subaru would have died in both episodes if Seishiro hadn't been watching his back from the shadows. I was also kind of disappointed that the whole story of Seishiro killing Hokuto wasn't explained at all. That's kind of the reason I bought Tokyo Babylon. All in all, this is a pretty good little OVA. If you can sit through the 1st episode, you'll really enjoy the 2nd.",1355616000,,1580,4.389078498293515

The English voice acting is quite bad, that's well established by now. Oh well, there is the Japanese track with subtitles, right? Not quite. The Japanese voice acting seem decent enough but the subtitles are outrageous. The timing is wrong half the time (the text appears before someone speaks or long after they finish speaking) and even with my minimal knowledge of Japanese I can tell they left a lot that was said unsubtitled or partly subtitled. Worse than that- they sometimes added dialogue that was not in the Japanese script. What makes the makers of this DVD think they know better than the script writers of the OVA? Their job is to translate, not rewrite the script.

The video and audio quality is also unimpressive- not what you would expect to see on a DVD.

Overall- quite bad.",1165276800,4,826,4.682758620689655
