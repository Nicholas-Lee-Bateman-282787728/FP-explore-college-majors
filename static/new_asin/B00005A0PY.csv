7934824,1,B00005A0PY,"This movie is marketed as ""Introducing Tiger Yang. Twice World Tae Kwon Do Champion"". Funny thing is, Tiger Yang is NOT in this movie. I know this because I am a student of Moo Yea Do, which was created by Twice World Tae Kwon Do champion and now World Grandmaster Tiger Yang. I know Tiger Yang personally. If you want to buy it for cool fight scenes, then yes, do so. However, this movie does not have Tiger Yang in it. FALSE ADVERTISING!",1421366400,,439,4.301204819277109
7934825,3,B00005A0PY,"One person claimed there were 87 bodies, but I had counted at least 152 (it was so late by the time I rounded third on the body count that I passed out). The only reason I tried counting was that I kept seeing people rolling their eyes in the backs of their heads with blood spewing out their chests, necks, or mouths. Even ""Terminator"" didn't do this much damage; I don't think the trilogy could even come close to the number of 6-foot holes needed to bury the dead!

""YOU KILLED MY MOTHER, YOU'LL PAY WITH YOUR BLOOD!"" says Tiger Wong (played by Jimmy Wang Yu), who had already done in another two handfulls of bad guys, pausing before wrecking more havoc after his buttons were pressed too hard and too often. He finally added to the slaughter, perhaps more than halfway through the film!

The dubbing pretty much sucks raw eggs, but I feel that's part of the joy of some of the martial arts films of its day, when the Asian characters mouths move, while British voices are heard instead. The color is really bad in my DVD pressing (one I had gotten at a true dollar store, where everything costs a buck). And there's a serious crop issue with the transfer being made from a standard TV format (4x3), when the film seems as though it were filmed in letterbox (around 2.35:1). That means that about half the original film is cropped in the transfer. But the framing during filming isn't fully exploited (like the composition of the scenes in Star Wars or Jaws, for instance). So, viewing this movie, you'll see more arms cropped out, than essential characters missing in essential scenes.

My version, a dual-sided DVD (with Snake Crane Secret on the flip) was worth the dollar spent. If you purchase any version over a couple bucks, try to make sure it's widescreen and a direct film transfer from the master negative. Otherwise, just get the cheapest DVD possible, so you won't be too frustrated over paying too much for a badly-pressed DVD.",1164412800,,1945,4.583333333333333
7934826,4,B00005A0PY,"Some quick stats for fans of martial arts films. Body count: 87 (holy crap!), with 6 ambiguous. Nude scenes: 0. Best death sequence:  An old lady impales a marauder with a completely blunt *FIREPLACE LOG* which she flips at him with her cane.  Awesome!  Spoken dialogue dubbed over in English.

Firstly, do not believe the plot synopsis listed above.  The film has nothing to do with an ""infamous bandit"" or a commissioner.  The negative reviews posted are perhaps for another film of the same title.

In Rage of the Master, an estranged relative returns to his family's martial arts school in order to destroy it and to prove himself.  After wiping out most of the school and killing its master (his brother) and his brother's wife, some surviving members of the family go to a local farm seeking help.  After a few failed attempts, the family enlists the help of a young kung-fu expert, Tiger (played by Tiger Yang), and his aging, but highly skilled mother.  Meanwhile, the estranged relative plots from his casino to hunt down and kill the remaining family members, with the help of droves of casino cronies and some strangely dressed Thai boxing experts, one of whom is disturbingly similar in costume to Michael Jackson.  When the thugs catch up with the protagonists, there's plenty of action and non-stop bloodshed!

With so many characters to keep track of in the film, it can get confusing trying to keep tabs on each character.  The young male characters in the film are all in similar costume and hair and are difficult to differentiate at times.  Several side ventures also add to the confusion.

The acting in the film is on par, but nothing special.  Some characters are better developed than others, but this is forgivable, given the number of characters in the film.

The fight scenes in this movie are epic.  After a couple of low level skirmishes between the two parties, things really start heating up.  In the film's later fights, literally dozens of bodies drop during some encounters.  The choreography is fine, and almost all of the films fights are group-on-group, rather than individual one-on-ones.  The fighting is about 90% genuine martial arts skill and 10% special effects, which is a good blend.  An added plus is the display of Thai boxing, which makes a nice contrast to the kung-fu used by most of the characters.

The skill of the actors is obvious everywhere, but surprisingly, the most entertaining character in the movie is Tiger's aging mother, who performs such outlandish stunts as killing a man by hurling a pair of scissors into his chest, the aforementioned impalement by a piece of firewood, and later, hurling giant blocks of concrete with a flip of her cane.  She even manages to keep fighting despite being run through with a knife and suffering multiple stab wounds.

Rage of the Master's action is hard to beat, and gets an easy five stars.  The plot gets four, and the acting gets three stars.  Any kung-fu afficionado will definitely enjoy this movie.  I purchased it as part of a bundle in the Martial Arts Action Pack, which includes three other feature-length films, all respectable.  Regardless of how you purchase it, Rage of the Master is a must-see.",1142812800,2,3209,4.826007326007326
7934827,5,B00005A0PY,"I completely agree with the other guy who wrote a review on this movie. This has got to be one of the funniest conversation pieces in movie history. We picked up a DVD copy of this from the grocery store for about 2 bucks, and decided to bring it home and enjoy. Boy, were we wrong. This was definitely not the ""action"" entertainment we expected. I spent most of my time doubled up on the floor because I was either: 1- Laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. 2- Vomiting because the movie was so useless. This is the epitome of horrible martial arts movies of the 70s. It took me a few times to get through this movie cause it was so terrible, but that's why my buddies and I loved it! Now, anytime we're at the store we look for more copies to send to our friends!

Two things I thought were hilarious about RAGE OF THE MASTER

1- The description on the back of the DVD cover had NOTHING to do with this movie! They were describing some other movie!

2- Check out the last fight scene on the beach- That's quite a nice NUCLEAR POWER PLANT for the year 1000!",1097366400,2,1056,4.192118226600985
7934828,1,B00005A0PY,"If you are looking to watch a truly awful and completely pointless kung-fu film, then I can highly recommend the film ""Rage of the Master"" (which I believe was previously entitled ""Hero"" or ""Rage of the Tiger""), starring Jimmy Wang Yu and directed by Wang Hung Chang.  Originating in Hong Kong circa 1976, the film begins at a kung-fu school that is attacked (for unknown reasons) by a gang of superior kung-fu fighters wearing red hot pants.  The daughter & son of the school's headmaster escape and seek assistance (eventually) from a man called Tiger (Jimmy Wang Yu), who only goes after the gang in a rage of vengeance after the gang attacks his home and his mother.  The gang, which consists primarily of anywhere between 30 to 50 individuals who mostly wear unbuttoned, long-sleeved white shirts (or red hot pants), works for a group of evil casino owners.  From the very poorly dubbed dialog, it is never clear why the gang attacked the kung-fu school to begin with.  Instead, the film focuses more on numerous kung-fu fights usually involving multiple people, including both men and women and usually using long knives.  This includes a lengthy and rather pointless kung-fu wrestling match that involves members of the gang fighting audience volunteers. Though the various fights are supposed to appear very realistic, serious and gory, it's difficult not to laugh when someone gets stabbed or when one of the main characters gets killed.  One annoying aspect of the film was the frequent close-ups of a sign written in Chinese in Tiger's home.  At no time during the film is the sign ever translated into English.
Overall, for very poor cinematography, bad dialog, pointless plot, laughable fight scenes and terrible acting, I can only rate ""Rage of the Master"" with 1 star.  The only reason why I watched the film was because I was at a friend's birthday and he likes to watch really stupid films sometimes.  Memorable aspects of the film include the presence of a gang member seen only at the beginning of the film sporting a long hair style reminiscent of Sonny Bono, another gang member seen frequently throughout the film that has a giant mole on his left cheek with a long thick hair sticking out of it and when one of the main characters unknowingly walks backwards off of a cliff.  Other actors who performed in this forgettable epic include Chiao Chiao, Yu Yang Kun and Yu Wang.  Though the film was produced long before the existance of the first video game, it very much has the feel of one.",1085961600,,2511,4.773672055427252
