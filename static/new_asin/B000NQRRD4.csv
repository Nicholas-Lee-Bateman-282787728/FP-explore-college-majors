8180804,5,B000NQRRD4,"I love this gnomomworkshop dvd! This subject goes right up my alley considering this is the work I like and learning something new every day, ""I'm a Digital Environment Artist"", well it has many old as well as new names for example Matte Painting, Digital Set Extension Artist, Virtual Environment Artist, and so and so forth.

 Sometimes the dvds from thegnomonworkshop are a little bit blurry to view but they have invaluable information from the best that are in the business today!

  So if the good people at thegnomonworkshop could just make them crystal clear that would be nice. I mean I should know I have a pretty big collection myself and it grows as long as my wallet allows it to...LOL.They are all really great but this one reigns as one of my favorites.

 And if any of you like Feng Zhu's concept art the sketch is his. Well I hope this has helped I know not everyone will find this benefitting or interesting but it is worth it.",1211846400,,945,4.523529411764706
