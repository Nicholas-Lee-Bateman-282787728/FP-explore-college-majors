8318444,5,B001LM64A6,"We waited a long time for this and were very glad to finally find it available! We rewatch it every few months. Delightful stories, atmosphere, characters, actiing.",1388966400,,164,5.111111111111111
8318445,2,B001LM64A6,"Unrated???  Series 1 was just okay and the 2 stars are only given because of the acting talents of Finney.  I left my kids watching Series 2 and when I walked into the room they couldn't wait to tell me how the movie had turned 'bad'.  As I watched portions of the DVD back, to my dismay, they were right.  For all the suggestive sexual content, this movie should be rated PG-13 and no less.  I won't even mention the drinking, 'shacking up' and carousing that goes on throughout the entire series.  Very disappointed; in the future I'll be careful of movies that are rated ""unrated"".",1281916800,7,584,4.462264150943396
8318446,4,B001LM64A6,An enjoyable movie. I like British films and would recommend it to anyone who wants  to enjoy a pleasant evening watching a movie which just gives viewer pleasure and sends you to bed happy!!,1264032000,4,191,4.617647058823529
8318447,5,B001LM64A6,"I waited for this season to come out on DVD for a number of years. Inexplicably the second season was released on DVD, while the first season was only on VHS. Thankfully I can enjoy them both now without fear of breaking the tape. Albert Finney shines as the roguish, clever, profane Uncle Silas. Be sure to order both series one and series two at the same time. You'll want to watch them back to back.",1237248000,6,402,4.302631578947368
