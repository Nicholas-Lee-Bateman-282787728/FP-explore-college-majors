8617200,3,B00FNPQW7M,"Nova does excellent work usually but this episode could have been better. The sights and sounds are exquisite especially the space views. The DVD only offers the hourlong special and no extra special features. The episode was fine but there could have been more shots from space. This episode is done with experts from MIT and others though.

Sad to say there are no special features included on the DVD.",1530662400,,404,4.771428571428571
8617201,1,B00FNPQW7M,"Terrible. Every mundane and irrelevant 'fact' is repeated over and over again while actual science is almost absent.
Pretty much unwatchable which is a shame because it is a fascinating subject.
NOVA needs to lose the non science drama majors that flunked grade 6 science class.",1442102400,,278,5.065217391304348
8617202,5,B00FNPQW7M,"This documentary is a truly unique wonder to behold!!!  The hidden Sprites that cannot be seen on land during a thunder storm (sometimes, yes), are located by research planes and the International Space Station!!  The film will have you sitting on edge until you see the first incredible images, then several profound images of these later in the film.  Yes, now we know they exist and in all their incredible beauty!  What a treat you are in for and NOVA does it again.",1424822400,,470,4.626506024096385
8617203,5,B00FNPQW7M,"I must admit that I too was surprised that this was really about sprites and not other things like the aurora, but I found that it was better this way.  I have several books on aurorae, but have barely heard of sprites.

Sprites are lightning strikes that go upward from some thunderstorm clouds, usually very potent storm clouds.  They had been spotted by pilots for some years before the first photo of one was taken in 1989.  The problem is that they are not only rare, but they are very fleeting:  milliseconds, not the seconds that we usually see with cloud to ground lightning.

This program documents how they have been captured very well in recent years, a few times from earth orbit and now by a team of experts -- some on the ground picking out likely thunderstorms on radar, the rest in NASA jets that fly to those likely sites.  A combination of luck, skill, high-altitude flying and high-speed low-light cameras have managed to capture a number of them.  The results are beautiful, downright stunning, and they showed that sprites come in a variety of kinds and that they connect the tops of the storm clouds with the (charged) ionosphere high above.  The earth's atmospheric electricity has been studied for many years -- Nova has had a couple of episodes on lightning in the past.  But this is new territory.  The experts are already giving names to the varieties and a few sprites have been spotted on the other planets.

This is a welcome addition to the study of earth's weather, albeit a very different kind of weather.",1423353600,3,1538,4.655555555555556
8617204,4,B00FNPQW7M,"Sprites are an amazing phenomena that are little known and hard to observe. This DVD clears up some of the questions including how Ilan Ramon, the Israeli astronaut who died in the Columbia tragedy was photographing these electrical flashes. Some of his work survived the crash and is shown. The global electrical circuit is included also.

The cover and even description of this DVD leads one to believe that much more and differing information is included. There is a tiny bit add in about auroras, but not much more. The subject of sprites is interesting and it would seem the title, cover and description should have been more specific about what was being shown in the program.
The DVD itself is 60 minutes long and has English subtitles.",1409875200,4,743,4.8046875
8617205,4,B00FNPQW7M,"While the number of videos on outer space and related topics is enormous, this one fills in fascinating details not mentioned in the others. Good to have for a more complete knowledge of what's out there.",1405900800,,204,4.694444444444445
8617206,5,B00FNPQW7M,"Everybody knows about the Aurora Borealis or Aurora Australis; this phenomenon has been explored from just about every angle you can count.

Did somebody forget to tell us about sprites?

A sprite is a common term used to describe elf-like beings of supernatural legendary creatures. Moreover, it refers to various spiritual beings like ghosts.

No not that sprite. A sprite is actually an atmospheric electricity (lasting 10 msec) appearing as globular flashes of red (pink to blood-red) light rising to heights of 60 miles.

First seen in 1973 by a pilot. In 1989 it was photographed. Now we get to watch the attempt to photograph sprites from the international space station.

I can say I've looked at sprites form both sides now. And still somehow...",1403654400,3,754,5.0
8617207,4,B00FNPQW7M,"The cover implies that this is about the northern lights, but that is only about 25% of the content - the rest is about sprites, which is fine but at least try and be honest in regards to the subject matter..",1402444800,,208,4.097560975609756
8617208,1,B00FNPQW7M,There is way too much on sprites and not enough on other atmospheric phenomena...including the northern lights! This is a terrible dvd!,1398988800,,135,5.181818181818182
