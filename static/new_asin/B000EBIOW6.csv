8108200,5,B000EBIOW6,"I had read reviews about previous releases of this movie which pointed out that some scenes were deleted. I took a chance on this DVD in the hope that it would be the entire movie and I was not disappointed. I've always watched this movie every chance I could and now I finally have it on DVD. This is one of my favorite action movies ever. I don't believe Blue Thunder or any helicopter could ever be looped like a jet, but it was hysterical to watch. Interesting story line, great cast. A must have for your movie collection.",1488758400,,527,4.333333333333333
