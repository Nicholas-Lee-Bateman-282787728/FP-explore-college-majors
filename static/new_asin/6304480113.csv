You will see James Drury as the Virginian and Doug McClure as Trampas. This was obviously made when Bronson was not quite as famous in the movies and was hitting all the TV shows of the day. It is a great video.",1235433600,3,338,4.2153846153846155

8073805,5,6304480113,"This movie is one of Bronson's best westerns and the movie also goes by the title ""Bull of The West"".  Bronson plays Rancher Ben Justin that is just trying to make a living starting up a cattle ranch; the main problem he faces in this one, believe it or not, is himself.  He is mad at everyone it seems until he finds out that not being the richest man in town isn't everything.  Of course there are some bad guys over at a neighboring ranch, but they play into a minor secondary story that correlates with the main one with Ben Justin and his family.  Overall, I'd say this movie leaves you with a better understanding of life and leaves you with a good moral message.",1131753600,6,669,4.285714285714286
