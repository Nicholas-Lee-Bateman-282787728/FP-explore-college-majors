My first impression, before watching the video, was this is going to be one of those hokey, cutesy videos with Joan Lunden.  I wasn't expecting much in the way of learning anything.  Well I have now learned to not follow your first impression!  It was well done and very informative.  I am now looking for the video to buy.

My husband and I learned stuff that we never knew or thought of before.",1018310400,2,663,4.512605042016807
