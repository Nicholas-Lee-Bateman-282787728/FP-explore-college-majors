8187145,1,B000OY0RZ0,The commentary is gross. A late middle aged man providing overtly sexist compliments to scantilly clad model/assistants. I was shocked to find this in the kids section of Netflix.,1519862400,,179,5.206896551724138
8187146,5,B000OY0RZ0,"I never much cared for magicians when I was a kid.  As an adult, I found them reprehensible.  But I am fascinated by how anything works, and these ""behind the scenes"" look at several long term magician's tricks kept me riveted.  The only bad thing is, they make the layman think they can do magic easily.  Fortunately, to do most of the tricks in these videos would cost a fortune.  Well worth a peek if you don't mind being disenchanted, or if you are enchanted by seeing the inner workings of tricks.",1474502400,,502,4.413043478260869
