8198979,4,B000R57W8Q,"First..Thanks VCI and Kit Parker - You really do find some lovely obscure films and issue them in MINT condition!!. A Prime example is on this Vol 6 of vintage Hammer films before the ""Horror"" hit the trail. Second...The films...THE BLACK GLOVE (Face the Music in the U/K and a much better title-I never did get the ""Black Glove"") is I think much the better of the 2. Filmed at Bray studios and on location in London this benefits greatly from the presence of Alex Nicol who carries the whole film (the support cast is rather weak). It's a good murder mystery with a bit of humour and some great 50's music courtesy of trumpeter Kenny Baker's Dozen. Well worth the price on it's own methinks. The second, DEADLY GAME, stars LLoyd Bridges and sadly is a bit of a bore (subjective opinion of course). Lloyd is good tho, but again the support is weak except perhaps for a young just beginning Maureen Swanson who looks good. Another murder mystery without much mystery and stock shots of Spain, otherwise all studio. There is no denying that Hammer did make some poor films in their early days, but it is so good to have the opportunity to see them and judge for ourselves. A few tit bit extras (trailers, trivia etc) and of course, to repeat, Excellent prints. Well worth a visit, just not quite 5 stars.",1359936000,,1302,4.521186440677966
