1900654,3,B0000A1HPU,"This DVD is great, but could've been much better. At only 75 minutes, SNL/NBC are giving a [weak] product.  Of course Will Ferrell doesn't disappoint at all on this though. Skits include:
-Behind the Music: Blue Oyster Cult (""more cowbell"")
-Spartan Cheerleaders @ a chess match
-""Dissing Your Dog"" commercial
-Harry Carey show
-the annoying lovers (with Rachel Dratch)
-the pretentious NYC store clerks (with Jimmy Falon & Sean Hayes)
-the bum as the nude art school model (can't remember his name)
-fishing with Bush Jr & Sr
-Jeopardy with ""Burt Reynolds"" ""French Stewart"" and ""Sean Connery""
-Robert Goulet does gangsta rap
-Bobby & Marty Culp at the Drug Awareness seminar
-Inside the Actors Studio w/Charles Nelson Riley
-Roxbury guys with Jim Carrey
the extras are pretty cool..especially the deleted skit with the ""old prospector."" I think that's the funniest thing on the whole DVD.  It also has Will's ""tryout"" with SNL, and 2 Conan O'Brien appearances.
But what is missing is the Neil Diamond Storytellers. I can't believe they left that off. SNL/NBC really could have given everyone a quality product but they just phoned it in.",1060905600,101,1138,5.047872340425532
1900655,5,B0000A1HPU,"This was a DVD that had to be made, and everyone knows it. Sketches include:
--Anti-drug school assembly musical number
--Blue Oyster Cult (""I need more cowbell!"" shouts Christopher Walken)
--Robert Goulet infomercial for his CD
--Craig the cheerleader working a chess match
--Ferrell as: George Bush, Janet Reno (boxing Rudy Giuliani), Saddam Hussein (on 3 way phone call with Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky)
--As James Lipton of Inside the Actor's Studio interviewing Alec Baldwin
--His Harry Caray impression
--As Alex Trebek on Jeopardy, with contestants including Sean Connery and Burt Reynolds
--As professor Roger and his hot-to-trot wife Virginia in the hot tub, harrassing poor business traveler Doug (Jimmy Fallon)
--As one of the Roxbury brothers with Jim Carrey and Chris Kattan
--Substitute art class nude model Terrence Maddox
--Infomercial for Dissing Your Dog
--Weekend update special guest Jacob Silj
--Father of a dysfunctional family with Sarah Michelle Gellar as his rebellious teenage daughter
Extra features include his SNL audition routine (he does his Harry Caray, a Ted Kennedy, and some original characters), two Conan O'Brien guest appearances, some outtakes, and one hilarious dress sketch which never made the final show in which he played Old Prospector Gus Chiggins, assigned to accompany an army unit into Afghanistan.
You know this stuff is good--in half the sketches, the other actors are sobbing they're trying so hard not to laugh. Especially Jimmy Fallon, who finds Ferrell so funny he snorts out half his lines. And through it all, Ferrell stays in character, fully committed. As James Lipton would say, ""What courage! What humanity! We are in the presence...of greatness!""
But any Ferrell fan will instantly rattle off several classic Ferrell sketches which are missing: Doug, the face of erectile dysfunction; the bad doctor; the commercial for the hamburger helper mix with antibacterial agents for weeks old ground beef, etc. NBC really needs to honor Will's body of work by issuing a second volume, or a box set, even. Such work must not be relegated to the whims of Comedy Central reruns.",1060732800,22,2134,5.26099706744868
1900656,3,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell is a genius, there's no getting around that. But I only recommend this to the hardcore Will Ferrell fans. At only 72 minutes, and a few more minutes of extras, it's just not worth it. Once again, another DVD a company produces to cash in on. And how could they not include Will's FIRST SNL appearance with him yelling at his kids to ""GET OFF THE SHED""!? A classic skit that wasn't included on this. What IS included is Celebrity Jeopardy, Bobbi & Marty Culp, Spartan Cheerleaders, The Roxbury Dancers, Hot Tub lovers, Naked/Homeless model,Devil singer,  ""MORE COWBELL!"" and more. I like Will, but this DVD does show his comedic ability. Go with Old School, or Zoolander.",1060732800,,683,4.739495798319328
1900657,2,B0000A1HPU,"I must say that I was dissapointed in the best of DVD for Ferrell.  It was only 73 minutes and most of that was filled with the cheesest stuff like ""The Spartans"" cheerleeder crap.  You do get Terrance Maddox and the Cow Bell but there is no ""Neil Diamond"" or the ""Bad Doctor"" stuff.  There is only one Harry Carry part and only 20 second clip of his George W Bush work.  SNL missed the boat on this one.  If you like the ""Alda Music Teachers"" type stuff then this is your DVD.  I would rather see Mr. Tartanian beat the crap out of his employees than watch the cheese of the Roxbury Night Club.  That is just not funny.  The best of Will Ferrell should be a 3 Disc set so everyone gets what they want out of it.  We get one commercial parody of the ""dog trainer,"" and I admit that it is funny.  Only one though. One Celebrity Jeopardy but it wasn't the sharpest or ""best of.""  I know a lot of people who were waiting for this to come out and they are going to be upset. NBC and the Producers at SNL don't really know the fans of Will Ferrell.  A few laughs when it could have been great.",1060646400,9,1088,4.0327102803738315
1900658,5,B0000A1HPU,"This DVD is one of the funniest things that you can buy.  Will Ferrell is mad funny and this DVD has all of his funny stuff from SNL.  Even though most of us have seen these sketches before, they are just as funny when you watch them on this DVD.  I highly reccommend this for anyone who wants to laugh for a lil more than an hour straight, and I think everyone will get a laugh from the Blue Oyster Cult sketch.",1060646400,,412,4.0
1900659,3,B0000A1HPU,"After viewing the new DVD featuring Will Ferrell's ""best"" on Saturday Night Live, I must say that I am a bit disappointed.  While many of the sketches featured were funny, such as the Blue Oyster Cult Behind the Music and the Culps singing about saying no to drugs, I felt that much of his most knee-slapping material was omitted from this DVD.  Where's the Janet Reno Dance Party where the former attorney general actually shows up?  Where's the Spartan cheerleader sketch with Jim Carrey as foreign exchange student Lockmiel?  Most importantly, where are the Bush/Gore sketches that were highly successful during the 2000 election?  We only see Ferrell as Dubya for a split second on this DVD!  I hope SNL is planning a ""Best of Election 2000"" DVD. Otherwise, there is no excuse for leaving this stuff out.
If you are a fan of Ferrell's sketch work, I would recommend renting this.  I personally would not buy it.  I've seen funnier ""Best Of"" collections from former SNL alumni.  I don't think this DVD does justice to Ferrell's long run on the show.  But do enjoy what is offered anyway.  I wouldn't call this DVD a total loss, but I would call it incomplete.",1060214400,10,1162,4.674876847290641
1900660,5,B0000A1HPU,"I would assume this DVD will contain the bits played during the ""Best of Will Ferrell"" episode they aired this past Saturday night 7/26/03. Included:
* Blue Oyster Cult with Walken - ""More Cowbell!""
* Dissing Your Dog commercial - CLASSIC!
* Dysfunctional family with Buffy as daughter - gets old quick
* Harry Carey Space show with Goldblum - ""Its a simple question doctor, would you eat the moon if it were made of ribs?"" Awesome!
* Nude art school model - Very gross!
* Lovers in hot tub w/ Fallon & Barrymore - everyone cracks up!
Plus lots of small clips from his skits. All in all it will definitely be worth the money. The dissing your dog commercial is worth full price right there! I'm glad they included that. The only thing I wish they would include is when he played the devil trying to write a hit song for Garth Brooks. The songs are hilarious!",1059350400,11,858,4.40251572327044

1900679,5,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell is positively hilarious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  There are so many good scenes, that's why there are 3 DVD's.  My personal favorite is the session with Christopher Walken as Bruce Dickenson directing Blue Oyster Cult playing ""Don't fear the Reaper"".  ""More Cow Bell Baby"" and ""I have a fever and the only prescription is more cow bell"".  Will is all over the studio running into everyone.  Jimmy Fallon is playing the drums and he can't stop laughing.  Will also plays Harry Carey talking to Jeff Goldblum asking so many stupid questions.  And finally he is introducing Charles Nelson Riley (Alec Baldwin) as one of America's ""biggest delights""!!!!  You can't stop laughing!!!!",1427328000,,688,5.247706422018348

They both had different covers (younger/older version of Will Ferrell) with different directors listed on the front and different copy write years on the back but the DVDs were identical text.

Where is the sketch about Will having his children sing multiple times ""Happy Birthday"" to their grandmother on the phone?  Where is Neil Diamond?  Where is the yoga sketch where Will takes advantage of his extreme flexibility?  Where is the faux commercial about the bottled water where one town goes and murders the other town in order to own the wonderful water (okay, not so funny, but edgy and interesting)?

Will is a talent and can be both extremely funny and subversive.  Unfortunately, we don't get enough of that in these DVD's.",1291680000,,613,4.735849056603773
1900716,5,B0000A1HPU,I always looked forward to Will Ferrell sketches on SNL. He created so many eccentric and memorable characters and was always 100% invested in the role. One of the few SNL alumni to have made a smooth and successful transition from tv to big screen. An unabashed performer and as Conan O'Brien once observed he's not at all self-conscious about his body.

1900718,1,B0000A1HPU,"I LOOOOOOOOOVE Will Ferrell, esp. from his SNL days but previous reviewers are right esp. J Evans - they did a TERRIBLE job of picking which skits to include in this DVD (and Vol. 2).  Even for the classic long-running skits they didn't pick the funniest segments to run.

They left out a lot of great George W. and Janet Reno skits which they just put together in a short montage of clips at the end - WHYYYYYYYYY?!??!!

Based on J Evans list of skits:

Dissing your dog, the pretentious NYC store clerks, that pirate theater show with I think Goulet, and the bum as the nude art school model - Not funny - who decided to waste time with those?!  WHYYYYYYYY

Wish they had picked better Spartan cheerleaders, Jeopardy, Culps, and Inside the Actors Studio segments.  WHYYYYYYYYYYYY

My DVD didn't have fishing with Bush Jr & Sr. and I agree, how did they not include the legendary Neil Diamond skit?

The Harry Carey show with Goldberg was great.  Roxbury with Jim Carrey was good, just cuz I love Jim Carrey.

Pretty much, this whole DVD had me screaming WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY??!?!?!!  Why don't they know what's funny?  Why did they pick some of the worst segments?  Why did they waste our time?  Why is it called ""Best of Will Ferrell?  WHYYYYYYYY",1279324800,,1254,4.631818181818182

MY favorite by far is Bush.  Here was my let down.  YOU WOULD THINK LIKE I DID YOU WOULD GET AN ENTIRE BUSH SKIT.  NOPE, YOU GET ONLY PART OF 1 & IT WAS NOT ONE THAT WAS REPLAYED BECAUSE IT WAS REAL GOOD.  Nope, whoever's idea it was to do that made a major mistake.

GOT a full skit of ""Jeopardy"" with the Connery & Reynolds being played.  Really enjoyed seeing that.

More cow bells is here.

1900724,4,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell is one of the funniest cast members of ""Saturday Night Live"" since the original cast left, and as such has more than his share of golden moments which can't all fit on one DVD. This DVD is volume one of Ferrell's best work, and has some stunningly brilliant moments (and a couple of letdowns as well.) The ""VH1: Behind The Music"" skit with Christopher Walken is one of the best skits ever to grace the show; Ferrell's willingness to fit into that way-too-small wardrobe and play the cowbell like a maniac plays perfectly off of Walken's scary straight man intensity. Other highlights include ""Inside The Actors Studio"" (his James Lipton is beyond wonderful), ""Jeopardy,"" and Craig the Cheerleader for the Spartans.

This DVD has a couple of extras including an audition reel, outtakes, and more. Everyone has their favorites from the show, and given the amount of material Ferrell was in, chances are that not all of yours are here. Fear not, as there is a second volume available, which is enjoyable, although not as consistently good as this one.

1900729,4,B0000A1HPU,"I bought this disc and have watched it a few times... it's the kind of thing you have to break out every year or two, which compliments Ferrell's funniest movies like Anchorman, Old School, Elf, and Zoolander quite well.

It captures most of his funny SNL material with only a few misses.  If you want more, also buy Volume 2 (not nearly as funny on its own, but the extra volume of sketches will help your collection).

Here's my rating of the sketches, each out of 5 stars:

Marty & Bobby Culp: Drug awareness assembly - funny, too short, 4/5
VH1 Behind the Music: Blue Oyster Cult (with Christopher Walken) - A true classic, 5/5
Dissing your dog training video - Hilarious, 4.5/5
Spartan Cheerleaders Chess Team tournament - Quirky, 3.5/5
Robert Goulet: Coconut Banger's Ball  - Highly amusing, 4.5/5
Snips - Will in thong at business meeting/Mini Cell Phone - Disturbing / funny, overall 4/5
Rachel Dratch gives birth to Will - More disturbing!  4/5
Jeopardy: Burt Reynolds, Sean Connery, French Stewart - Classic, 4/5
Inside the Actors Studio: Charles Nelson Riley (Alec Baldwin) - Classic, 3.5/5
The Devil teaches Garth Brooks a song - Amusing, 3/5
Snips: George W. Bush/Janet Reno boxing Guliani/Clinton, Monica, & Saddam on the phone  - Good versatility, 4/5
Space the Infinite Frontier with Harry Caray (& Jeff Goldblum) - Weird! 4/5
Hot Tub Luvas (with Drew Barrymore) - Amusing, 3/5
Roxbury Guys (with Jim Carrey) - Dated but worth a chuckle, 3.5/5
Snips: Good Morning Latte/Dog Show  - Amusing, 3.5/5
Nude guy poses for Art Class (with Lucy Lawless) - Creepy!, 3.5/5
Family yelling at dinner (with Sarah Michelle Gellar) - Amusing, 3.5/5
Jacob Silj: Voice Modulation (on Weekend Update)  - Amusing, 3/5

Extra features:  Audition as Harry Caray, Conan, etc. - Good stuff, 4/5

Overall rating, 4/5.  Basically if you are a Will Ferrell fan at all you need this DVD in your collection.  They definitely could have had more Bush, Goulet, and the Culps, but definitely worth having!!",1229299200,,1991,4.869436201780416
1900730,3,B0000A1HPU,"This has some funny bits in it.  Some of the best skits are hilarious because of someone else in the sketch.  Christopher Walken steals the ""Cowbell"" sketch, and Jim Carrey adds that something extra to the predictable ""Roxbury"" sketch.  Some of these just aren't even remotely funny like the Robert Goulet one, while the quick takes offer some of the funniest laughs.  Some of these just drag on too long.  The Harry Caray bit is funny, but after a while it just seems like Will is simply trying to think of something funny to say.",1221868800,,531,4.5473684210526315

Especially in what has to do with impersonations and over the top funny situations.

I recommend this DVD to Ferrell's fans, since they will probably get a kick out of some of the sketches, but you should be warned about the fact that this is not even close to the best Ferrell has to offer. For those people that have not had that much exposure to this comedian, I would suggest that you look elsewhere, there are many movies starring Ferrell that will provide you with more enjoyment and a better way to gauge his talent.",1198540800,,730,4.572519083969466

Toss in a few other all-time classics and you've got one of SNL's real MVPs. No one beats Hartman, but Ferrell and Murray are right up there, all tending to bring out the best in the other cast members.

Will's James Lipton is also classic, as is his W (accurately smug and moronic), his Harry Caray, the hot tub couple, the now-ubiquitous cowbell skit, the cheerleaders, and on.

A lot of unique and hilarious moments here, from a really funny guy.

1900746,1,B0000A1HPU,"As a fan of SNL from the beginning, I'd have to say that overall, these collections are poorly edited. Many of these performers BEST work never show up on these compilations. These discs have the feel of a slap-together, push-em-out, sell-them-off quality. Many of the skits are cut and not complete! I remember far funnier stuff that was omitted, while less humorous stuff was included! Many of the skits on these ""best of"" compilations appear on each others' compilations (one on Ferrell's appears on Walken's. for example) The running time on most of these discs are an hour or LESS! (Couldn't they expand the length of these things to 2 hours or more?? These are supposed to be showcases of these guys BEST work!!!??) I don't really care for the multi-pack compilations either. I think to include Sandler in this package (as well as the 10 performer multi-pack!) is merely to cash-in on his big screen success. He really never contributed much to this show- his screen time was limited, and he really was not much of a comedic presence, much to the disagreement of ""Happy Gilmore"" fanatics! (I would've included either Hartman, Lovitz, Ackroyd, Carvey..someone who actually carried the show, or was a major player!) My advice-- buy individually who you like, and while watching, think back on some of the funnier stuff that they left out!",1188345600,19,1342,4.890350877192983
1900747,4,B0000A1HPU,"I have to agree that these are not the best moments of Will Farrell from his career on Saturday Night Live. The segment selection here leaves much to be desired. This man is one of the most gifted comedians of our day but I almost felt as if the producers of this DVD were intentionally leaving some of his best stuff out. For one thing, there's nothing here from the 2000 Presidential Debates in which he masterfully lampooned George W. Bush so I was left somewhat disappointed by these two volumes. The bottom line, however, is that, in what remains, a good bit of it is absolutely hilarious. The skit on the dog trainer was something that I replayed three times in a row and only then could stop convulsing with laughter.

My favorites are the Cowbell and the Roxbury sketch which is in this dvd. But I was hoping for some more Jeopardy sketches because the one in the dvd wasn't my favorite. I do have admit that the sketches of Will seemed to be thrown together randomly. I especially disliked the actor studio sketch with alec baldwin. But everything else I totally loved. I kind of miss Will on SNL because SNL sketches aren't as funny anymore. Will does love to ad lib though which you can see in the sketch of ""Space the infinite frontier"" playing as Harry Caray. Jeff Goldblum was confused and Will Ferrell actually made the sketch more funny because of that. Overall it is pretty good but I want more sketches!! Vol 2 isn't as funny. I wouldnt recommend Vol 2.",1166140800,3,889,4.36144578313253

Some of the sketches seen on Vol 1 are more extended verisons like the sketch were Will is wearing a half t-shirt and a thong like underwear to the office, celebrating patriotism. Another one would be an extended verison of Will being born. I didn't find this as funny especially towards the end. Vol 1 is definitely better. You should buy it if you want Will Ferrel beating up Rudy Giuliani (former Mayor of New York). I got a kick out of that. But I do suggest people buying it separately.",1166140800,,544,4.29126213592233

1900758,3,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell is in my oppinion the best cast member SNL has ever had. Vol. 1 of this collection includes pretty much all you need. All his famous characters: Marty Culp, Gene Frenkle in the famous ""More Cowbell"" sketch, Alex Trebek in the ""Turd Ferguson"" Celebrity Jeopardy sketch, The Spartans are on there of course, Robert Goulet, James Lipton, Harry Carry, The Lovers... The only thing it lacks is a really good Bush. There is a short Bush segment, but not the finest. Vol. 2 opens with the ""Access of Evil"" Bush sketch, but unless you are a die hard Ferrell as Bush fan, don't waste your time with vol. 2. The only things Vol. 1 really lacks is a ""Morning Latte"" or ""GET OFF THE SHED!"" I would have loved to see that on there, but alas, one can't camplain too much. Plus, Vol. 1 has a hilarious blooper reel and Will's apperance on Conan as Robert Goulet. Bottom line, don't bother with vol. 2, there's nothing on it you can't live without. I give this collection 3 stars just because vol. 2 isn't worth it. You can buy them seperatly, and had I known ahead of time, I would have rather than buying the set. I give vol. 1 5 stars.

1900763,4,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell was a giant in the recent history of SNL and none of the contemporary male cast come close, in my opinion.

I've only seen volume 2 of this collection, which I thought was a little flat in places maybe, but overall was of a very high quality.

There's nobody does angry or outraged like Ferrell, and the evidence is there for all to see in the sketches where he is an office manager (with Pierce Brosnan) or a patriotic office worker (with the bloke from American Pie). He is such a great physical comedian, he really throws himself into these parts 100% so that it is truly invigorating to watch.

The disc also contains a couple of interviews with Conan (the Irish one in particular being very funny) and some sketeches that never got aired.

I think these SNL DVDs could maybe be a bit better value for money, since you only get an hour and a half of material at best, but because they are all divided into sketches it helps for flipping through the disc to get to where you want. It's the kind of disc you can view over and over again, so I recommend it. I have no doubt Volume 1 is better, but vol 2 is a pretty decent substitue.",1146700800,,1147,4.271889400921659

1900765,4,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell was one of the best performers in SNL history, and as of a couple of years after he left, they still do not have anyone in the cast who stands out the way he did.

Many of the critical comments made in the earlier reviews are valid. Nevertheless, I believe these two disks are a more than worthwhile purchase for SNL fans. Ferrell was a fearless performer who, according to one of the SNL writers, actually gained weight for the show simply because he thought it was funnier to be fat. Watch the Blue Oyster Cult ""cowbell"" skit, and the ""Dale McGrew - U.S.A!"" bit and it's hard to disagree.

I do wish they had included the bit where Will gets a badger stuck up his butt, but you can't have everything. Enjoy Will Ferrell while we wait for the next stand-out SNL performer (with one eye on Mad TV).",1140652800,,811,4.328947368421052

There are plenty of skits on the DVD that people are well familiar with, such as the James Lipton skit, Craig the Spartan Cheerleader, Harry Caray, etc. Yet some of these skits had escaped my attention, like the ""Dissing Your Dog"" skit. I had to watch parts of that one a few times over... hilarious. Will Ferrell never disappoints me.

Moreover, many of the skits are just bits where Ferrell plays a minor chracter in them. This DVD is also very brief. It just comes across like a rip-off.

1900775,3,B0000A1HPU,"If you are a fan of Will Ferrell, you should get this collection.  While some of the recent SNL releases have been pretty lackluster, resulting from the fairly lackluster performers that have graced SNL in recent years, Will Ferrell is truly a character actor that deserves his own set.  In fact, my only real complaint of these two DVD's is that they don't provide us with more footage.  There is a ton of material that they left out--easily enough for another two DVDs.  I'm not holding my breath for volumes three and four, but if you ask me, they ought to be on the way.

VOLUME 1 provides you with some of Will's best sketches, including the Blue Oyster Cult scene, Harry Carey, Jeopardy, Robert Goulet, Inside the Actor's Studio with Charles Nelson Riley, and more.  Even more impressive are the extra features.  This disc provides us with a glimpse of Will's audition to SNL, two of his hilarious appearances on Conan O'Brian, and the best sketch ever: the Old Prospector.  It was a sketch that was cut from one of the aired shows, but it is hilarious.  Simply hilarious.

VOLUME 2 fails, in some ways, to keep up the pace.  I do not think that the disc is an overwhelming disaster, as others have stated.  Often times the second volume of any compilation will lack punch, but I was pretty pleased with this one, due to the depth of Will's career.  While not as good as the first disc, this volume picks up several of Will's one-time characters and shorts.

Overall, as I said, I feel that there was a wealth of material that did not make these discs.  Of course, that is bound to happen in any compilation.  But if these discs are going to be some of the flagships of the SNL series (and I believe they are), why not give us more than 70 minutes of action per disc?  Why choose some of his mediocre sketches when you can throw in his better ones?  It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

My recommendation: if you are a moderate fan of Will Ferrell and SNL, you can buy VOLUME ONE without any worries that you are missing something by passing over VOLUME 2.  If you are a true fan, buy the double pack.  But don't say I didn't warn you.",1125878400,22,2148,4.387341772151899

1900778,5,B0000A1HPU,"I actually never really watched Will Ferrell on Saturday Night Live so I don't know if this is his best stuff, but I think it's absolutely hilarious. It has a lot of great sketches but also contains just really small portions of really good sketches. I wish they had those sketches in their entirety! But, the ones that they do have are great. My favorite are:

- Harry Carey

- Craig the cheerleader

- Commercial ""dissing your dog""

- Jeapordy with French Stewart, Burt Reynolds (Turd Ferguson) and Sean Connery

- the Roxburry guys! Awesome stuff!

- Will Ferrell as the devil

- the father of a troubled family (I own a Dodge Stratus!!)

And sooo much more. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have A LOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTT of laughs.",1120003200,,739,4.587786259541985
1900779,5,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell fans, rejoice!!  This DVD set promises more laughs than a year of lesser quality comedy.  Ferrell shows once again (in full character) why he is the ultimate King of Comedy.  From Robert Goulet (Goulet!) to Gus Chiggins, the old prospector, to the Devil, Ferrell does it all in style...and with side-splitting originality with help from writing genius.  Cameos from Christopher Walken, Garth Brooks, Drew Barrymore, Alec Baldwin, Jeff Goldblum and others push the hilarious momentum to an uncontested speed.  The usual cast shines - and tries not to laugh - when next to the ""Brilliant blinding light from heaven"" that is Will Ferrell.  The bottom line;  if you haven't seen these DVD's you haven't lived (Note to reader: YOU WANT TO LIVE) There.  I said it.  Now run to your nearest HMV and purchase the two disc set before something terrible befalls you and you leave this world having not lived a full life.",1118016000,3,923,4.865384615384615
1900780,1,B0000A1HPU,"I rented this movie, hoping it would be ""the best"" of Will Ferrell. I am very disappointed, out of about 15 sketches, only 2 were reasonable enough to watch.

Will Ferrell is one of the best comedians in the USA, this dvd makes him look awful, he should've protested this garbage.

Atleast they still show SNL reruns on tv still....",1117065600,,332,4.516666666666667
1900781,5,B0000A1HPU,"Is it any wonder why Will Ferrell has been compared to such ""Saturday Night Live"" legends as Dan Akroyd and Phil Hartman? He is so talented and was the first out of a number reasons to watch the show between 1995 and 2002. Despite a spectacular gathering of comedic talents, Will carried the show on the back, eliciting laughs in even the worst sketched and creating over 100 impressions and charatcers in a seven yeear period.

""Satureday Night Live - The Best Of Will Ferrell"" contains all of his classic moments - the Culps, ""Celebrity Jeopardy"", the Spartans, the Roxbury Guys, Harry Carrey, Robert Goulet and so much more! Just try not to laugh when you see him shake his a- while banging the hell out of that cowbell in the ""Blue Oyster Cult"" sketch. Or even make an attempt to sit still as he, as James Lipton, sucks up to an equally hilarious Charles Nelson Reilly (Alec Baldwin). Trust me, you will not succeed.

My only qualms is that there are a few great moments left out. We only get forty five seconds of his classic Bush impression (though to be fair, when do you the same impression 30 times it's kind of hard to pick which one's the best) and only brief clips of his Janet Reno impressions, ""Dog Show"" and ""Morning Latte"". Also, they don't show any of the ""Storytellers"" sketch with Neil Diamond, which is a fan favorite.

But what's here is here and what's here is hilarious. My advice is to go out to the store and pick up this dvd today. (But please, don't get ""The Best Of Will Ferrell, Volume 2"").",1111795200,2,1519,4.456834532374101

I only found myself laughing out loud maybe 3 or 4 times, and even then they could have done better. Will Ferrell is such a genious comedian yet this DVD makes him look almost like an amateur. These sketches are OK, but there are SO many more ferrell's that could have and should have been chosen. If you like Will Ferrell and enjoy collecting Ferrell DVDS or what not, then its worth the buy...or if you enjoy just collecting the ""SNL Best of's"" then have it...but if you want to get a DVD that will make you laugh non stop till you are crying then this is definitely not a good buy. Just stick to the old re-runs that are on E! everynow and then, those will make you laugh more",1106352000,2,831,4.232704402515723
1900783,5,B0000A1HPU,"This is great. I miss SNL because I have problems staying up that late. So I bought this and I was laughing so hard I thought I was going to have a heart attack. Almost every skit is funny. My favorites are Celebrity Jeopardy of course with Burt Reynolds Sean Connery, and French Stuart. Norm MacDonald does the best impersonation of Burt Reynolds and Darrell Hammond is really funny too as Sean Connery. The second best is the Blue Oyster Club where Ferrell plays Jean a 70's sort of hippie. Just the way he talks, looks, moves is hilarious even the other guys could not hold it in. Christopher Walken is also in this one as the lengendary Bruce Dickinson who wants more cowbell. I also loved the dissing your dog commercial especially the last dog ""he disses"" poor Margaret. These 3 are the highlights of the DVD, but the rest is also funny.

Will is also great as he impersonates Saddam through a 3 way call between him, Clinton, and Monica Lewinsky, its short but very funny. There is a short short clip of Will as George W. Bush thats lasts about 1.30. There are edited skits on this DVD that can be found on the 2nd DVD in its entire version. They are Will as Janet Reno boxing Rudy Guiliani, Dale Mcgruer when he comes in late to work wearing a half shirt, no pants, and has thonglike shorts on where you can see his azzcheeks, a very short clip of him playing Bush Jr. with Bush Sr. played by Dana Carvey trying to catch fish and where he works as a blind gay manager at a clothing store with gay men. I didn't enjoy the annoying lovers one that much, where Will plays the father trying to control his wife and rebellous teenage daughter played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, a skit where Will dressed up as the devil and helps Garth Brooks belt out some tunes on his guitar. I did however enjoy the skit where he plays a homeless bum named Terrance Maddoxx and poses for art students in the nude and says some really perverse lines. Its gross but funny as well. Of course there is the classic A Night At The Roxbury with Jim Carrey and Chris Kattan which makes it all the better to watch. One of my other favorites is when he plays Harrey Carey and asks Jeff Goldblum the most stupidiest questions but just the way he does it makes it great.

The skits that are not too bad include inludes Bobby and Marty Culp at a highschool drug awareness seminar, Craig the Cheerleader, and Will as James Lipton. The one with James Lipton includes Alec Baldwin who I thought was really funny too. There is a skit that never aired live but it is included in this DVD. Ferrell again with his impersonations impersonates a 70 year old man named Gus Chiggins who wants to fight in Afghanistan with all the younger recruites. All the younger recruits could not hold in there expecially Jimmy Fallon. I am sad this never aired live because it is extremely funny and I am glad they included it is this.

1900784,2,B0000A1HPU,"I think there are much better comedians out there, but there were many funny Will Ferrell moments on SNL.  Too bad such a small percentage of them are featured on this DVD.

ONE Jeopardy skit?  Not even the funniest one?  No Janet Reno stuff - I truly expected to see the Dance Party.  I don't even recall seeing George W. skits.  I also didn't like that many of the skits were truncated.

I expected this DVD to be a LOT longer - slightly more than an hour total was too short. I would've paid more to get one DVD that contained a lot more skits.

To be fair, most of the skits contained on this DVD are funny.  But this is overshadowed by the disappointment of not seeing the best of the best and the too short duration.

I planned on buying the other ""Best of"" DVDs - Eddie Murphy, Phil Hartman, etc., but now I think I'll try to rent or wait and get them used.",1104710400,4,864,4.119760479041916

There are so many bland skits in this collection (the post 12:30 AM garbage) that you wonder who complied this thing.  The distributors must be considering parcelling out the best skits among several disks (perhaps including those under the names of other SNL best-of titles).

But i thought the funniest was the Night at the Roxbury skit (which was made into a movie). That was so funny. Probably because of Jim Carrey in it. So over all i thought it was a great movie and highly reccomend it to someone who would want a good laugh.",1103414400,,515,4.309278350515464
1900788,4,B0000A1HPU,"I bought this because I started getting into the reruns of SNL on Comedy Central last year.  SNL has always been hit and miss, and depending on the cast, either funny or just plain stupid.  When Will Ferrell was still in the cast which I think was about 5 years, it may have been longer, he created some unique and funny characters.  The funniest skits on here are the ""Behind the Music"" with Christopher Walken and ""Don't Fear the Reaper"".  I need more COWBELL is hilarious!  The Robert Goulet album endorsement is also extremely funny as well as his playing the organ as a medley with Ana as an older couple trying to act hip, a classic character combination.  The voice modulation character is hilarious but I would have rather saw a different one where I believe he was talking about China.  Unfortuantely, they cut this short with the ending credits, unnecessary.  All is not great but the majority will get you laughing.  I just bought volume 2 hoping for some of the bits that didn't make this one.  I only saw Adam Sandler's SNL dvd and this is much funnier.

Will Farrell, in my opinion, is one of the funniest actors to hit the set of SNL.  There were mountains of classic sketches from which to choose when compiling these this set, yet these releases are terrible.  Volume 1 has one Jeopardy sketch (quite funny, of course) and a very, VERY small snippet of Farrell doing his Bush thing.  Everything else is pretty much trash on Volume 1.  Scattered throughout volume 1 are a bunch of three- or four second clips from ""C+/C"" sketches.  I kept getting pissed when one would start and I'd think to myself ""finally, one that I can force myself to laugh at"", and it would get cut off.  Well, in volume 2, some of these sketches are shown in their entirety.  You can't but feel double-charged for SNL's double-dip on these clips.  Volume 2 is just as empty as volume 1 in that it really doesn't contain Farrell's best material.  Where are the presidential debates?  Where are the other jeopardy sketches (remember: out of BOTH releases, we only get ONE)?  Where are the sketches of the angry father who lashes out at his kids in sudden bursts of rage?  I'm not exaggerating when I say that the entire collection seems like the producers ordered all of Farrell's sketches from ""most hysterical"" to ""barely made the cut"", and then started at the wrong end.

I won't be surprised when volume 3 is released:  ""Best of Will Farrell:  No, seriously.""

This entire collection is just dreadful.  I'm a big fan of Farrell's and this collection is a disgrace.  I wouldn't recommend either release to even the most loyal of fans.  I'm giving it two stars instead of just one only because it's Farrell.",1100044800,9,1753,4.57556270096463

Anyway, I don't think I've ever been filled with more joy than I have been while watching these DVDs.  My birth?--nope.  Christmas morning?--nope.

I think Goulet is also the base for his Anchorman character.

Definitely worth buying but taking away one star for not have Neil Diamond VH1 Storytellers.  This is by far his best skit and has by far his best line ever: ""NO, I WILL LEAVE YOU IN"", how can the call it a best of without it???

The problem with these collections is that fans have their favorites and almost always a few of them are missing and that's definitely the case here.  In fact, some of the particular recurring sketches like ""Jeopardy"" & ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" could've chosen better examples than what ended up here for those.  Again, what is here is funny and the extras are nice too.  Here are the sketches in order that make up the main feature (the sketches are pretty complete except for where I list them as ""snips"":

VH1 Behind the Music: Blue Oyster Cult (with Christopher Walken)""More Cowbell, baby!"" - A personal favorite!

Dissing your dog training video

Snips - Will in thong at business meeting/Mini Cell Phone at new wave store/Rachel Dratch gives birth to Will

Jeopardy: Burt Reynolds, Sean Connery, French Stewart

Roxbury Guys (with Jim Carrey)

Snips: Good Morning Latte/Dog Show

Outtakes: Hot Tub Luvas (with Winona Ryder), Goulet as Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Sketch (with Seinfeld), Voice Modulation on Weekend Update, George W Bush & George Bush Sr. (Dana Carvey), Neil Diamond on Weekend Update, Fight in club (with Ellen Degeneres), Tap dance (with Katie Holmes), and Mini computer email at New Wave shop (with Pierce Brosnan)

As you can see, the disc is above average in content and as far as these collections go, this one's up there.  None of these collections will be perfect because the focus is on stars who have done a slew of hilarious sketches and many of them will be left out.  Personally, I was disappointed to not see the VH1 Behind the Music on Neil Diamond...priceless.  I agree with a previous reviewer that said Will needs something like a three disc set to even scratch the surface of his hilarious work on SNL, but this is better than nothing and probably as good as it will get unless SNL one day sees Season set releases.

1900800,5,B0000A1HPU,"Even though he only left the show two years ago, you still feel a tinge of nostalgia when you watch Will Ferrell on ""Saturday Night Live"". Perhaps it's because his versatillity evoked memories of such famed castmembers like John Belushi, Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman. Or maybe it was because he was just so damn funny.
""The Best Of Will Ferrell"" tries its best to capture the best from Ferrell's 7 years on the show, and while it's far from definitive, it makes a vailiant effort. All the sketches here are hilarious. Whether he's Craig The Cheerleader, Robert Goulet or George W. Bush, Will will have you in sketches. Some sketches, namely the nude Art Class sketch, grow on you, but you'll learn to enjoy them. The best sketch by far is ""Celebrity Jeopardy"". In addition to Will's sidesplitting (if not entirely accurate) Alex Trebek, he gets additonal support from Jimmy Fallon as French Stewart, Norm MacDonald as Burt Reynolds, and Daryl Hammond's infamous Sean Connery. There's also the classic ""Blue Oyster Cult"" sketch, which is naturally to funny for words.
Everybody has one sketch not here that they would have loved to see. For me, it would be the Jeopardy sketch with ""Chardonay"". But other than that, this is a hilarious dvd. I also suggest watching Will's auditon tape, especially his hilarious Ted Kennedy impersoantion. Get this dvd today!",1088726400,3,1356,4.9

This DVD has sketches including many of your favorite Will Ferrell characters, but I would not say they're the best sketches with these characters... Sometimes the audience barely laughs through the whole scene. Shouldn't that be a major indication that the sketch isn't that great?
Some of the sketches are totally incomplete and only feature very short portions of the scene. Why? The DVD doesn't even have a very long playing time. They could've easily fit in more video.
But that being said, it does feature some humorous sketches. I enjoyed watching the scenes where they would bust out laughing.

This DVD is missing some stuff like the 2000 Election skits but there are pletny of notable skits here.
The Blue Oyster Cult skit with Christopher Walken is excellent. I was rolling over in pain he was so funny. All the guys on the set were laughing and they couldn't even look him in the face.
Craig the Cheerleader is great. He was great as the cheerleader and it's one of the funnier skits on the best of. Will and Cheri Oteri are great together. The skit they do as the singing teachers is great also. Great parodies.
I was disappointed their wasn't a whole lot of Bush stuff. He was great as George and there is only a brief moment he is on there doing him.
I was disappointed they didn't do the whole dress down patriotic skit with Sean William Scott. Will is great in that g-string panty thing he is wearing. That was one of the funniest skits I've ever seen and I wish there would have been more of it.
There is a Jeopardy skit on there. It's not the funniest one they ever did, but it did have Sean Connery and Burt Reynolds in it, so you know it's going to be good.

While I agree some better stuff was left off, what is here is a good selection of skits(including two of my faves...Will as the devil trying to make a hit song for Garth Brooks and the 'more cowbell' session with Chris Walken).  However, whatever is lacking in some skits in the main feature, is more than made up for in the extras.  They include:
* audition:  here he does Harry Carey(sp), the ""get off the shed!"" dad, and his cat playing with a toy impression.  it's just a curiosity piece really, but interesting to watch once.
* photo gallery:  nicely done,  but only a handful of pics!  seems like an afterthought really.
* dress rehearsal:  an ""old prospector in the military""  skit.  this one was funny mainly because Will(as he usually does) was cracking everyone up in this segment.  worth at least a few views.
* outtakes:  here we go...some great stuff here.  it only lasts a few minutes, but has some LOL moments!
* tv appearances:  2 from Conan.  one has him doing his Robert Goulet persona throughout, the other has him promoting his Roxbury film(in that revealing outfit, then doing his 'Patton'  speech audition).  Both segments are shown in their entirety surprisingly.
True, the outtakes coulda been longer and more 'never seen' skits coulda been included, and the best Will Ferrel/Conan segments(Will as the 'sexy' leprechaun) coulda been shown;  but perhaps a best of Will Ferrel V.2 will handle all that?

Ferrell is a comic genius, however the producers of this disc are not doing him justice.  This is a rental, not a purchase.",1075248000,3,626,5.038834951456311
1900819,4,B0000A1HPU,"Will Ferrell is one of my all-time favs from SNL.  I rented this DVD first and liked it so much I bought it to add to my collection of SNL best-of's.
This contains most of his funny characters...the Professor and his ""lover,"" the cowbell skit, Pres Bush, Craig the cheerleader, the morning show, and of course the high school music director.  These are great to have on hand to pop in when I want a laugh.
There are a few skits missing...I wish they had put the skit when he is in the backyard yelling at the kids to ""Get off the Shed""!!! But overall, I think the hits are here.
If you are a Will Ferrell fan, I don't see how you can be disappointed with this collection of skits.",1074643200,,680,4.183206106870229
1900820,1,B0000A1HPU,This was the first 'best of' that i have gotten from SNL. I was not impressed at all. It only had like 12 skits on characters he's played. I was expecting to sit down and see 30 skits. That didn't happen. Not really worth it.,1073779200,,225,4.022222222222222
1900821,1,B0000A1HPU,"Everyone with half a brain knows that the best & only cast of SNL worth watching was back in the late 80's to early 90's with the likes of Dana Carvey, Phil Hartman, Kevin Nealon, among others.  Every cast before or since has been nothing but a sinkhole of talentless, boring, pathetic losers trying to be something they're not.... funny.  The only way any of these people, especially Will Ferrell, could make me laugh is if they fell down a few flights of stairs and broke thier necks.  Please, if you are entertaining the idea of purchasing this dreck, do something more constructive with your money... throw it out the window.  That's what your doing anyway.",1072224000,3,661,4.672413793103448
1900822,3,B0000A1HPU,"This DVD set was a let down.  As always Will Ferrell is hysterical, but the selections of clips that were included in this DVD were disappointing.

I can never stop laughing when I watch that.  YOU CANNOT TALK TO ME LIKE THAT, I AM A DIVISION MANAGER... I DRIVE A DODGE STRATUS!!!  Pretty much, it just doesnt get much better than the best of Will Ferrell... cept maybe the best of Chris Farley, but that is a whole different story.",1070236800,,458,4.267441860465116

1900825,4,B0000A1HPU,"The only reason I'm not giving this DVD a five-star rating is that I was never a fan of the Lovers sketches and they include two of them here (one from the show and one from a bloopers segment).
I am giving it the full four-stars for the Celebrity Jeopardy (always a classic), Ferrell's always side-splitting impersonation of Harry Carray, Robert Goulet singing rap (and Ferrell appearing on Conan O'Brien as Goulet), James Lipton from ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" (although I preferred the Toby Maguire as Screech better), and a VH-1 parody of ""Behind the Music"" where the always-hysterical Christopher Walken insists on more cowbell for a Blue Oyster Cult recording.  There are several more very funny ones but these are my faves.
Other really interesting segments includes a sketch cut during dress rehearsal and Will Ferrell's actual audition tape.
I'm looking forward to other SNL Best Of editions if they're as decked out with extras.",1067126400,3,939,5.019230769230769
1900826,5,B0000A1HPU,"There are so many great Will Ferrell skits but these are just a few of his most hilarious. Be sure to check out the extras, because the Gus Chiggins skit is the best and who could forget.....Goulet!",1066608000,,198,4.378378378378378
1900827,4,B0000A1HPU,"There is no way you can view this DVD and NOT laugh at some point. However, I have to agree with what many others have commented: there are too few skits, and many of his funnier skits are not present on this DVD. Two of these include his portrayal of the corporate businessman's childlike temper tantrum, and an older commercial (I think it was a ""Time-Life"" parody) of classic Thanksgiving family arguments in which he plays a father who keeps losing it when family problems arise at the Thanksgiving dinner table. In sum, although this compilation certainly contains hilarious Will Ferrell moments, it does not truly capture his ""Best,"" as the title suggests.",1066608000,2,662,4.867256637168142
1900838,1,B0000A1HPU,"This may be the worst collection of Farrell clips they could've put together. I loved The best of Chris Farley, but this was a mess. The skits we're weak and nothing we haven't seen before in their many compilation shows.. How many times has he played Trebek? Do we really need to see the same one with Sean Connery, Burt Reynolds, and French Stewart again? And not even the whole skit on top of it all.. What a waste of money this was! What a shame......",1065484800,3,455,4.3023255813953485

1900840,3,B0000A1HPU,"I have no idea why they would put so little of his best stuff, or so little generally (72 minutes, including outtakes, dress rehearsal, tv appearances) onto a DVD.  Did these people have anyone review these selections, or watch the whole thing, prior to releasing it?  Doubt it.",1062374400,3,278,4.770833333333333
1900841,4,B0000A1HPU,"A DVD can hold around 3 hours of video per side, so think of all the unused potential in this disc that only runs 72 minutes.
Ferrell was my all-time favorite cast member, and there are literally DOZENS of his hilarious skits that didn't make it in this collection.  Remember his portrayal of Fred Friendship in the ""Jingleheimer Junction"" sketch with Tim Meadows and Cameron Diaz?  I nearly passed out from laughing too hard when I first saw that one.  And there are too many more to mention.
I looks as if SNL just took the bits from the TV-aired ""Best of Will Ferrell"" episode and put it on a DVD, along with a few other bits and pieces.  If they'd truly mined for Ferrell gold, they'd have put out a 2-DVD set with a LOT more.
To be fair, though, there are some features on this disc which are very interesting and were previously unavailable.  We get to see 2 of his appearances on Conan O'Brien's show (featuring Will in character as Robert Goulet in one of them) and his audition spot for SNL in the mid 1990's.  In that spot, we get to see the origins of some characters and sketches that would find their way onto SNL over the years.
Still, having this DVD is better than NOT having a Will Ferrell DVD.  But distilling his best bits onto a 72-minute DVD is like releasing a Beatles ""Best Of"" compilation on a 4-song EP.",1061856000,9,1328,4.352226720647773

1900843,5,B0000A1HPU,"Picked this up as soon as I saw it on the shelf, as I am a HUGE fan of Ferrell's comedy.
The disc runs about an hour and 15 minutes. It contains mostly full sketches, but there are also a few 'quick peeks' at other memorable moments from Will's 7-year run on SNL. The Spartan cheerleaders, the Roxbury guys, Terrance Maddox, Bill and Marty Culp, Angry Dad, the Lov-ahs, and Robert Goulet are just some of the classic sketches included.
The special features aren't many, but they are quite entertaining. They include outtakes, part of Will's SNL audition, some Conan O'Brien appearances, and a never-before-seen sketch [cut during dress rehearsal].
Funny, funny stuff. More COWBELL!!!

1900845,5,B0000A1HPU,"I'm convinced that will ferrel doesn't even need any material to be funny.  Whats funny w/ him is not the mechanical SNL catchphrase, but the entire performance, the characters he brings to life.  Plus he has that Aykroyd anonymous/everyman quality that makes his sketchy behavior stick out even more, it allows more contrast.  He knows the inner goofball of the collective unconscious.",1061164800,,386,5.193548387096774
