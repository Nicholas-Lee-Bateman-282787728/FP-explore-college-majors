4127914,3,B003IPD97A,"Read the first book and watched the movie when I was too young to do either LOL, was surprised to hear there was a part 2 watched it and unfortunately hated it lacked originality and Judy's kidnapping was silly, plus I was pretty sure that I had been appraised that the Prince was the Baby-Daddy in the book so didn't get the necessity for Lace 2.  If your a diehard and just want it go ahead but I would stick with the original film.",1393804800,2,434,4.166666666666667
4127915,5,B003IPD97A,I saw this series years ago and loved it so bought it and loved it all over again.  Great Entertainment!,1381795200,,104,4.2
4127916,4,B003IPD97A,"I have been looking for this movie for a while, but for this price it isn't going to happen from Amazon. ProStore has this entire DVD set, both Lace and Lace II for only $24.99.. I buy a lot of my movies from Amazon but for this one time it is not the best place.",1373760000,10,263,3.8
4127917,5,B003IPD97A,"What a fun sequal to the popular ""Lace"" mini-series a year before this one. The first Lace had lili(Phoebe Cates) character,finding which one of you bitches is my mother?The sequal has Lilis mom kidnapped and lili trying to put money together and finding her real dad. Although I liked the actress who played her mom way better,thsn the one in Lacd 2..the movie does have great moments and song by Deniece Williams. This is a must add for Phoebe Cates fans,the Lace films bring the glitz,glamour,fashion,soapy Dynasty type feelings that makes it easy to watch and be glued in and Phoebes beauty does help..fun film!",1313280000,3,615,4.866666666666666
4127918,2,B003IPD97A,"Don' let the steep price fool you; ""Lace II"" is really an awful, tacky sequel to one of the most dazzling, even epic mini series of all time.  This one lacks in just about every department.  gone is Lily's crazy Euro accent, along with her bitchy, biting persona.  Now we have an Americanized, 'girl-next-door' type who likes to wear sweaters and browse photo albums with her mother.  Also Judy is no longer Bess Armstrong, but another actress. I guess Bess read the script and decided to steer clear.  The script is just plain stupid.  It contradicts the events of the first one, and makes no sense.  Characters that were innocent in the first are villified here. for example, Prince Abdullah genuinely loved Pagan in ""Lace I."" In part II, he rapes Judy and keeps it a secret from Pagan for decades? What the hell? Really awful. And there is some insipid plot aboout Judy being kidnapped and held hostage in Vietnam or some jungle.  sure it is fun to see Maxine and Pagan again, but ""Lace II"" lacks the polished sheen and epic scope of the first one.  I guess it had a much smaller budget as well.  Take it from a true fan of the original franchise; here is a sequel that is a waste of time...",1310169600,14,1194,4.435779816513762
4127919,1,B003IPD97A,I  should not rate this DVD as I have not purchased it.  There seems to be some difficulty in purchasing and the price is prohibitive.  I think I'd better hang on to my VHS copy that I taped from the original airing on TV.  I just purchased  and received Lace I.  I have not had a chance to view it.  I hope it is as the reviews say it is.,1292630400,2,339,3.757142857142857
4127920,1,B003IPD97A,"I ordered this movie and not even a day , they cancelled my order without a reason. I wish Amazon would take stuff like this off ! If the seller can not produce the goods avertised they need to REMOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!",1291248000,4,215,4.142857142857143
4127921,5,B003IPD97A,"I am a sucker for the 80's and older types of movies. when I first saw this movie, it inspired me as a teen. To see a young lady go through hell and back but came out thru it all smelling like a rose. This story reflects what happens sometimes in reality. her strength but also her anger brings this movie to life. It is a movie laced with passion.
This movie reminds me of Charlene's song ""I've never been to me"".

It is not easy to find movies that educates and motivates women. This is one of them.

I also recommend you to watch the movie 'A woman of substance'.",1279584000,6,566,4.09009009009009

8397628,3,B003IPD97A,I think the story itself could have been presented in a better.  On the whole it was okay.  It was nice to find it after searching for it for so long.,1489104000,,150,3.806451612903226

8397631,3,B003IPD97A,"Unlike Lace, it fell short of doing the book justice. I can only guess that, since it was the 80's, they shied away from a lot of the material in the book. What was re-written for the screen was written well, but the book is a powerful story and this adaptation, while good, didn't measure up.",1442966400,,293,4.25

8397633,5,B003IPD97A,"Thank goodness this is on DVD.  I love Lace I, especially the ending.  Lace II is even better in my opinion.  I just hate that the mother from Lace I didn't do this sequel.  Oh, well.  It's still a good movie with action, adventure and Lili being the fascinating, beautiful creature who is woman and child wrapped in a very appealing package.  Yet she's matured since Lace I and nothing and no one can stop her from rescuing her kidnapped mother.  Lili is a fascinating character.  I don't care what anybody says, I love Lace I and Lace II.  I love the character Lili.  She's always fascinating and interesting to watch.  You never know what she'll do or say.  She's unpredictable, vulnerable, sexy, good, bad, sweet, naughty and a woman of action.  She's a survivor.  She's an enigma.  She's always changing and evolving.  Nothing and no one can stop her when she goes after something.  Enough said.",1440547200,,900,4.630573248407643
