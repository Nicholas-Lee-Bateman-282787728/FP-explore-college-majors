I would hurry home to watch it.  It wasn't like other soap operas or serials.  Watching them has brought back a lot of happy memories.  I have 1 - 12 at the moment and I am enjoying them everyday.  The whole show revolved around vampires, witches, gypsies, portrait of Quentin Collins (EX. Portrait of Dorian Gray) murder, mayham, and mystery.  I give the entire series a thumbs up!!!",1219968000,3,708,5.825242718446602
1974351,5,B00016MCAE,"Having seen all the episodes and story-arcs of ""Dark Shadows"" this is the set  I started with until one day I buy the final one (Collection 26), and if you're not really a hardcore fan than you might consider starting off here as well because this is where the supernatural elements of ""Dark Shadows"" really kick in.

""Collection 11"" is where we're first introduced to Quentin Collins whom in this story-arc is an evil ghost, and Barnabas' main adversary. Not to spoil future episodes, but the character of Quentin evolves a lot through later episodes to be nearly as indispensable a character as Barnabas Collins.",1166745600,8,614,4.838095238095238
1974352,5,B00016MCAE,"This DVD continues the story of Angelique as the vampire.  In the previous DVD, Nicholas had put the curse on Angelique because she disobeyed him.  After a series of events, Angelique was allowed to bite Barnabas.  This is the storyline that is on the Dark Shadows View Master from 1968.  It is most enjoyable as the plot thickens around Nicholas and HIS plans conflicting with Angelique and HER plans.  There are plenty of twists and turns that will keep you glued to your set.
Eventually the plot segues into a new story about Chris Jennings who comes to town looking for his little sister.  When the moon is full, Chris transforms into ""an animal that walks like a man.""
When we first hear the growls coming from the animal from behind a door, our interest grows even more.  As we watch, we wonder what is this curious sound coming from inside the room?
As this DVD shows, the audience for Dark Shadows had plenty of reason to keep coming back in ever increasing numbers.  The show continued to grow in popularity even to the extent of the beginnings of Dark Shadows merchandising.  The first bublegum cards, books, posters, and other items got introduced at this time.  Dark Shadows was a hot property on ABC, and 1968 was one of its best years ever.  In terms of ratings, only the storyline to follow in 1969 was hotter.
If you like Dark Shadows, you'll want to continue watching to see how the story from the last DVD set plays out.  We don't like him, but what becomes of the violent and heartbroken Adam?  Where does Angelique end up?  Does she make Barnabas a vampire again, or does he stay as her slave?  Can Julia and Willie rescue Barnabas?  Does Nicholas succeed in creating a whole race of beings like Adam and Eve?  And what does he do with Maggie Evans?  What about Maggie and Joe?  Will they get reconciled?  Will Victoria reconcile with Peter Bradford?  And finally, what happens when the new terror strikes when the full moon rises?
All of those questions and many more can be answered by watching this excellent story on Dark Shadows DVD Set 11.  You will enjoy it!",1088812800,29,2085,4.548387096774194
1974353,5,B00016MCAE,"This latest Collection 11 of the daytime gothic supernatural TV masterpiece, Dark Shadows, brings a very welcome turning point in the plot of the series, along with some unwelcome cast changes.
The truly dreadful storyline involving Adam (similar to Frankenstein's creature) who was played by Robert Rodan is thankfully almost over. This story almost sank Dark Shadows when it first aired about 40 years ago, causing viewers to tune out in droves, and I fear that it may have done the same to many of those viewing the series for the first time via DVD. But please rest assured, we HAVE hit rock bottom. The plot only gets better and better as Dark Shadows embarks on some of its best storytelling and acting of the entire series.
The 40 episodes collected here not only pretty much close the aforementioned awful story arc, but also restores everyone's favorite reluctant 175-year-old vampire, Barnabas Collins (played to perfection by Jonathan Frid), to his former glory. It also introduces the mysterious Quentin Collins (portrayed by David Selby) in a Turn-of-the-Screw type plot that is facinating as well as frightening. Child actors David Henesy, who played David Collins, and Denise Nickerson, who played Amy Jennings, are terrific and spooky as the children controlled by Quentin's malevolent spirit.
Sadly, this set also marks the departure of Alexandra Moltke who portrayed Collinwood governess Victoria Winters and whose character had been the lynchpin of the series. Moltke's departure left a permanent void in the show. It was her voice viewers first heard when the show debuted in 1966. In the first episode, Moltke, as the innocent but compelling governess, was traveling by train to Collinsport, Maine. The scene opens with a now historic audio prelude that began,""My name is Victoria Winters."" The use of an audio prelude performed by a cast member continued throughout the entire series. Kathryn Leigh Scott, who played Maggie Evans, eventually became the Collins' family governess.
Other cast members including Joe Haskel and Jeff Clark/Peter Bradford (portrayed by Joel Crothers and Roger Davis respectively)also leave the series. (Davis would return for a short stint later playing a different character.)
This collection of episodes also interjects a werewolf for the first time to the deadly perils of life in Collinsport, a creature that would remain a staple with the series almost as long as vampires and evil curses.
If you've stuck with this terrific show through the forgettable Adam story line, you owe it to yourself to view these episodes before judging this remarkable series too harshly. It remains one of the truly great, groundbreaking TV shows of all time.",1077840000,71,2694,5.195402298850575

One day my child-care provider introduced the series to me and I was hooked ever since. Never, had I known or seen the ending, so this is my chance to see it all over again with a more understanding of the series. Because of these DVDs, I was able to attend my first Dark Shadow Festival in Brooklyn, NY, the year before Jonathan Frid past.  I got to meet Lara Parker, David Selby, Jerry Lacy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Roger Davis, and many others because of these DVD's. Thanks Amazon.",1388793600,,632,4.3931623931623935

1974376,5,B00016MCAE,"I was a Dark Shadows fan when the series first aired and am having a delightful time wandering through Collinwood again. My interest peaked when Quentin appeared and that is where my focus still lies. This set contains the story line where he first appears. He has no lines but his looks convey all the bitterness in his heart. Even as a child I enjoyed the campiness of the sets and stories. I still do. There is a spookiness conveyed that is missing in so many of today's offerings. Today it seems all about shocking the audience. Dark Shadows is more true to the great early films with its mystery, it's haunted rooms and creaking doors, the Maine fog and the dank underground cellars and caves. If you like to think about your mystery stories, this is the series for you.",1357948800,,775,4.50354609929078

1974380,4,B00016MCAE,"More or less, Volume 11 takes you away from the poorly themed episodes of the ""Adam "" and into what made a person interested in Dark Shadows to begin with.  I also got tired of watching episode after episode of Angelique being scripted to cause evil and death in everyone's life and felt they were overdoing her part just to showcase her beauty and perpetuate the writer's lack of imagination.  She never seems to get her come uppance ....quartered by 4 horses would have been nice.....but is allowed to linger.  I think this gets very monotonous and boring so I skipped volumes 8,9,10.....",1353715200,,590,4.70873786407767

1974382,5,B00016MCAE,"Remember watching this series on television.  Am now enjoying it all over again.  Brings back a lot of memories.
If you are a fan of this type of stories, well worth it.",1350604800,,169,4.25
1974383,4,B00016MCAE,love the fact that the first episode in this collection originally aired on Halloween. Dr. Julia Hoffman is at her best,1350432000,,119,4.714285714285714
1974384,5,B00016MCAE,"In this collection the Adam - Eve relationship really goes haywire leading to a chain reaction of terrible tragedies. Angelique, aka Cassandra continues her wicked ways and manages to outdo Nicholas and lure Eve into no good (which wasn't far to go). Nicholas is becoming more human. He marries the human being he loves - Maggie Evans...things do not go happily ever after. We see the hellish place and creature that Nicholas and Angelique claim their allegiance to. The hellish creature is not someone you make deals with...and they find out. Alexandria Moltke is looking rounder in the middle and is here for the first few episodes (then leaves for her real pregnancy). The replacement actress for Vicky (Betsy Durkin) makes her appearance and Vicky finally weds her love Jeff/Peter after their second attempt, but they do not live happily ever after either. Does anyone in Collingwood really do? Adam continues his revenge rampage against Barnabus and Julia and hovers on the edge of suicide or life without love. The kind Prof. Stokes once again takes Adam in while while lamenting about his failure with Adam the first time. We also have the twin of Tom Jennings, Christopher (played by the same actor) and sister Amy make their appearance in Collingwood. Christopher has his own dark secret that he keeps from everyone.

Some additional thoughts on this Dark Shadows Collection. I know that things must twist, bend and turn and things cannot stay the same in real life - or soaps. This Collection makes me sad because we see less and less of the longtime DS characters. A favorite is gone with the real Vicky. I just cannot get used to this new Vicky (Betsy Durkin). I found myself dozing off through some of the episodes. The new characters are not as likable as the old favorites, neither is their storyline. I remember watching DS as a young teenager after school and many of these parts in this particular collection I do not remember at all...especially the replacement Vicky. Could it be that I lost interest then - and even now (dozing off)? I do remember the upcoming Quentin storyline and I will continue watching just to see it coming up next.

I still do adore Dark Shadows and the old characters. The acting is incredible.

I do have to add that this MPI Dark Shadows Collection has terrible humming audio in the DVD titles. I a tried viewing on my laptop, my flatscreen TV with DVD player, and my BlueRay player. The hum does not go away. If you can find this collection through another video dist. do try.

Now, onward to Collection 12 I go!",1350086400,2,2561,4.7225950782997765

1974386,5,B00016MCAE,"I enjoyed this collection, but wasn't pleased with the plot of Nicholas Blair exit. He left showing weakness and he was known for his strength and power and should have been written off in that manner.  I was also disappointed that Adam scars were not removed.  Yet, the collection was quite entertaining.",1323734400,,305,4.846153846153846

1974388,5,B00016MCAE,"And about darned time I might add. A lot happens in this set and I'm only going to touch on them briefly so as not to spoil. Angelique continues to terrorize Barnabas as she schemes to reunite with him for all eternity - but she needs a little help from a *friend* to get Nicholas Blair out of the picture, and oh what an interview that was! The Adam/Eve story finally winds down, as does that of Nicholas Blair (what a delicious ending). There's also a newcomer to town, Chris Jennings who bears an uncanny resemblance to recently vanquished vampire Tom Jennings, and boy does he have a whopper secret of his own.

Best of all though, is the beginnings of the Quentin storyline (my all time favorite), and the possession of the two children, David and Amy. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Seriously spooky stuff and had me enthralled the entire weekend. Fans of the old series should enjoy getting a second look at the action, cheesy sets or not.

1974392,5,B00016MCAE,"Barnabas is amazing & I adore Jonathan Frid no end. Much of the series success is attributed to him. He's my favorite.

Was curious if anyone knew if on some of the DVDs, a scene skips a few lines, like when Sherrif Patterson questions Julia & Mrs. Johnson about Barnabas' attack. It's happened occasionally over some of the dvds, so I'm wondering if this is simply one of the dvd glitches by MPI.

the scene I'm referring to is on the second episode of collection 11. As I said, not too often, but every now & then, a few lines by the characters is skipped during a scene on the DVDs from MPI. Otherwise, they're spectacular & I love my DVD sets.
