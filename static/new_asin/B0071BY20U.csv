8508128,5,B0071BY20U,"Just a few comments...Seeing these motion picture artists who are still active in their ""old age"" is a great experience. If you know their work or not, you can't help but cheer for these men...and only hope to be doing as well, after having done so well, IF you are blessed to live as long. Why the so called ""film buff"" gave this film one star is beyond my understanding and somewhat sad. Take Care!",1429401600,7,400,4.346666666666667

8508130,5,B0071BY20U,Love learning the unknown side about successful films! The stories behind the art direction for some classic films are told very well if you are interested in this stuff. I purchased and don't regret owning it. Fun watch.,1401408000,3,221,4.842105263157895

(Not to mention, experience the roller coaster of emotions that comes from watching it.)

The first time I watched it on my laptop as a $2.99 download. But then I bought the DVD. Because I wanted to watch it on a large screen and because I was ""hooked"" by intriguing list of ""Special Features.""

Got my money's worth.

For me, the top three extras are:

> ""The Man on Lincoln's Nose"" (For Alfred Hitchcock fans, a must-see documentary);
> ""North by Northwest: String Quartet"" (one of ten ""Deleted Scenes"");
> Unedited, 23-minute video of Robert Boyle teaching at the world's best film school.",1349049600,3,777,4.725925925925926
8508132,1,B0071BY20U,"This DVD arrived yesterday and I am an avid Film buff and a teacher of Film studies on the high school level.  The presentation was dry and boring and the information was minimal.  I was disappointed after I viewed it and the ""bonus material"" was stringent at best.",1342915200,,265,4.5
8508133,5,B0071BY20U,"You know the type of film that somehow gets under your skin and you find yourself revisiting little details long after you saw it? This is one of those.

It's a last-reunion story, a capturing of priceless moments and shared insights between 6 of Hollywood's most iconic film artists of the last century. We've had lifelong love affairs with their work, but never knew their names or recognized their remarkable contributions. Until now.

From production design to cinematography, the incomparable talents of the 6 profiled - all that's just a backdrop of sorts, like a grand set design, for a much larger, incredibly moving human story. The values of these wonderfully humble guys repeatedly rise to the top like cream in milk. Their lifelong friendships have endured and ripened over time.

Production designer Robert Boyle was a treasure, solidly grounded with a keen sense of humor that kept things light. Age can do many things to us, but ultimately our character shines through. And his remained young and beautiful.

Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Daniel Raim did a masterful job weaving the elements of the story together into something unexpectedly greater than the sum of its parts. And for that, a standing ovation.

As far as rating the film goes, I'd give it 10 stars but Amazon's rating system ends at 5.

Spectacular. See it if you can. A worthy addition to any film collection.",1331856000,5,1396,4.969957081545064
8508134,5,B0071BY20U,"With the emphasis so many modern filmmakers place on dazzling moviegoers with CGI and pyrotechnics, it's easy to forget the talented people who've always worked behind the scenes, creating movie magic with techniques predating our current digital age. SOMETHING'S GONNA LIVE (SGL)is bursting with absorbing, entertaining anecdotes about the golden age of filmmaking, including appearances by Haskell Wexler, Production Illustrator Harold Michelson, and Director of Photography Conrad L. Hall. As if the presence of these greats didn't already guarantee that SGL is a must-see for film lovers, Raim focuses most keenly on three longtime friends and colleagues during the twilight of their lives: Production Designers Robert F. Bob Boyle, Al Nozaki, and Art Director Henry Bumstead, a.k.a. ""Bummy.""  Of the three, I'd say Al had the most crosses to bear; as if his unfair incarceration at Manzanar wasn't bad enough, he also had to contend with retinitis pigmentosa slowly stealing his eyesight. I found myself in awe of Al's incredible grace and fortitude under the circumstances.

Bob Boyle matter-of-factly muses, ""I think everybody's here by accident. At any moment, anybody could get cancelled. Then there are all those things that we do to ourselves. In my case, I overindulged in almost everything. I smoked too much, I drank too much, I lived too long.""  Nevertheless, onscreen the trio's increasing physical frailty doesn't slow down their sharp minds. These men are just as witty, smart, and on the ball as any young hotshots. I especially liked Bummy's quips about film sets that don't look lived-in enough. No doubt their love of their professions kept them young in mind and spirit over the years -- proof of the importance of spending your life doing what you truly love, if you're lucky!

I must say the gents were pretty darn dashing, too, wearing suits and ties on the sets of THE BIRDS and NORTH BY NORTHWEST. There's a particularly nice photo of Bob, Harold, and visual effects whiz Albert Whitlock, no slouch in the dashing department either. As a Hitchcock fan, I especially enjoyed these particular anecdotes, including Bob's theory that if Hitchcock was alive and making movies today, he'd happily use the current digital technology as long as it truly served the story's purposes. Bob and Harold's return to THE BIRDS' Bodega Bay after 37 years was one of the film's highlights. Bob, Bummy, and Al joke about being ""three old farts,"" ""three old bastards,"" and ""three tottering people,"" but I think Bob nailed it when he described them all as ""three old soldiers.""

Raim caught the friends on film just in time; sadly, 91-year-old Bummy died in 2006; Al died at the same age in 2003; and Bob died in August 2010 at the milestone age of 100. Still, this remarkable film left me feeling like I'd had a chance to be part of their outfit for 80 minutes; it was a pleasure and a privilege to get a look at these men's exciting, meaningful lives being truly lived to the fullest.

SGL is like a fond, wistful, yet buoyant time machine voyage, deserving a place on the must-see list of anyone who loves movies inside and out. It's a thoroughly entertaining yet heartfelt documentary with much to say about the art, heart, and soul of filmmaking, as well as the duration of friendships, the passage of time, the team effort required in such endeavors, and the legacies that all talented people inevitably leave to enrich generations of creative artists to come. If movies and moviemakers intrigue and thrill you, SOMETHING'S GONNA LIVE deserves a place in your movie library!",1331510400,11,3588,4.981636060100167
