3695348,3,B001MDEK32,"I like John Edward - so don't get me wrong about that. One thing he can't control are the people responding to the information he offers them. Some of these people are so Slow and dopey!! - I want to slap them. I can't think of a real example - but like: ""Did you have an uncle named Ralph??"" - Five minutes later - it dawns on the person - 'Yes - they Did have such an uncle!"" - DUH!! - This is a 10 DVD set and every other DVD only reviews the episode of the previous DVD. I either Don't need that - or they should have just put his comments WITH the DVD in question. I went to see John Edward in 2008 - Impressive -- but $175 a ticket!! - Come On!! He said in his book that being a Medium comes first - Not the money. $40 would have been more like it - esp without a reading. Scott MacNeil.",1353110400,2,793,3.812121212121212
3695349,5,B001MDEK32,"I have seen the series and purchased the set to pass ""singles"" on to friends. I lost my 10 year old son, John Thomas, a few years ago and the comfort that I find from John Ewards readings is undeniable. I have faith that my son is near but now I KNOW that he is!",1297641600,6,262,3.7818181818181817
3695350,5,B001MDEK32,Watched the entire dvd set in one weekend.  Can't get any better than this if you are into psychic readings.  I've seen him in person as well.  He is the real deal.,1270080000,6,164,4.0625
8320957,5,B001MDEK32,"Skeptics will glaze over the amazing capabilities of John Edward (McGee) without paying attention to what is transpiring.  It is easy to adopt the slogan ""there is no such thing as psychic power"", and leave the major question hanging, how in the world can he 'guess' the specific details of a person's life and relationship when they have been dead...or crossed over into another reality...for many years?  It is too obvious that his subjects, the people whose private lives he 'trespasses' into, are not paid teary eyed actors.  They are real folks, common folk like you and I, and the exhibited contact with their friends in the reality after this one, and the joy of contact should warm the heart of every observer.",1487894400,,718,4.821138211382114
8320958,1,B001MDEK32,"Waste of time. Hack ""psychic"" nonsense that any teenager can figure out without prompting.",1475712000,,90,5.5
8320959,5,B001MDEK32,"John Edward is always a joy to watch.  This is the second set of Cross Country I bought, because I wore out the first one.  Love it!
Just wish Cross Country 2 would come out.",1454544000,,174,3.942857142857143
8320960,5,B001MDEK32,Love it!,1414108800,,8,3.5
8320961,2,B001MDEK32,Would buy it again,1409097600,,18,3.75
8320962,4,B001MDEK32,John is amazing.  I love when people say no and he contradicts them.  I was not sure that I would like the back ground information but it proved to be the part I like the most.,1392336000,,176,3.861111111111111
8320963,5,B001MDEK32,Yes there is some duplication so I only watched the five discs but am still very happy with my purchase and John Edward.,1391990400,,120,4.260869565217392
8320964,5,B001MDEK32,"We really love John Edward and have seen him twice in person. But I think this season is even better than in person. Because there's the up close and personal conversations and his thoughts on the readings. Anyone who has lost someone, I think could heal from this. I know it helps me know that my loved ones aren't gone. They are still with me.",1391904000,,345,4.323076923076923
8320965,3,B001MDEK32,"Love John Edward's shows.  These are excellent.  BUT it says it is a 10 DVD set.  In reality, it is two copies of a 5 DVD set.  I've never seen this before, but every other DVD is an exact duplicate.  Very bizarre and given that a lot of people question John Edward, it seems like not very good press to deliberately misguide the buying audience.  Still for $10, a great deal....just not very honest representation.",1388793600,,415,4.466666666666667
8320966,5,B001MDEK32,"Being a Medium myself, I love John Edward. He brings so much peace and hope to those in crisis or looking to connect. He gave me answers that I was looking for and peace with death. If you are very spiritual and interested and interested in life after death. Try reading one of his books or just get a video or two. You won't be disappointed.

 The one thing with this package though is, that the 2nd CD in each one, is a repeat of the first, just with added bonus footage. So it was really false advertised that it was complete season 1.",1383609600,,538,4.163461538461538
