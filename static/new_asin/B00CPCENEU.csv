8584441,5,B00CPCENEU,"Amazon has done a great disservice to this magnificent recording featuring Gutierrez by placing ALL the rave reviews in the wrong place-under the very average Mei DVD of Somnambula. Placing reviews under the wrong DVD is becoming an increasing, careless trend at Amazon, but this is the worst I have seen- virtually all the 10 enthusiastic reviews in the wrong place and only one very lukewarm review under the correct DVD-",1426723200,4,423,4.971830985915493
8584442,3,B00CPCENEU,"I love traditional productions, and this is definitely a beautiful, traditional production.  Scenery and costumes are absolutely perfect.  The singing, also, well above average, with the sole exception of the leading man.  I am sorry to say, the tenor is quite annoying.  He has an unusual voice with an unconventional timbre--dry and reedy with a fast vibrato, not what we are used to hearing, completely out of place in this cast of otherwise typical and pleasing Italianate voices.  I will say he acts convincingly.  However, this is not a small part and it really detracts from the whole.  So much so, I am afraid I'm not much interested in sitting through it again.

I can't help but wondering if he was deliberately cast because the part is such an unlikeable character, therefore he ought to have an unlikeable voice?  If so ... that is no way to run an opera.  Is Rigoletto's Duke of Mantua a role model?  Should we therefore have to cringe when we hear ""La donna e mobile""?

But if he was not cast for that reason, then why?  These people obviously know how to put on an opera, so maybe there is a reason ...

I hate to criticize, but for the price of this Blu-Ray, and it is not cheap ... I really expect excellent quality throughout.  And I think others would like to know, if they are looking for a enjoyable opera DVD.  This one is problematic.",1406937600,4,1357,4.522633744855967
