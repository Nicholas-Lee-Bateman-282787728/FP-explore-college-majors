4099439,5,B0039ZBM78,Excellent. We purchased the DVD for Wheels on the Bus and found the additional stories and songs every bit as enjoyable. Music is pleasantly appealing and often even soothing background to stories. Who doesn't love Burl Ives ? Animations and illustrations wonderfully done. Excellent choice of stories. Each presented well. One of our very  favorite DVD s which is a pleasure to listen to and children never grow tired of watching.,1297814400,6,431,5.070422535211268
4099440,4,B0039ZBM78,I bought this item for grandchildren who are 22 months old. It was bought as  a Christmas gift at the suggestion of their mother. They watched it several times during the time we spent with them and they enjoyed it very much.,1294444800,,225,4.357142857142857
4099441,5,B0039ZBM78,"I have a 6 year old boy that I bought this DVD for, also purchased Dem Bones and Wheels on the Bus books to go along with it and he loves them. The DVD would be great for a toddler the imagery is simple like a book and has nice soothing music to go with it, I found it very relaxing. Great DVD to add to your collection on long car rides.",1291593600,2,338,3.7083333333333335
4099461,3,B0039ZBM78,"I bought this DVD because my 2 year old (almost 3) LOVES Wheels on the Bus song and another show based off of it. I was pretty disappointed when it played and the animation was just so-so and the actual Wheels on the Bus part is extremely short. The other cartoons on the DVD are okay at best, my 2 year old won't watch any. I gave 3 stars only because my daughter still loves to watch Wheels on the Bus.",1365811200,,404,4.0
4099462,4,B0039ZBM78,"I had bought this DVD before and it wore out from so much use. So I reordered it and I assumed it would be the same as the other one. But this one had different extras and did not have the video "" Dem Bones"" which was a favorite of my Grandson. We were disappointed that it wasn't the same.",1363305600,8,290,3.85
4099463,5,B0039ZBM78,They memorized all the songs and they sing it everywhere. Actually it was really funny that 2yrs old kept try to sing a song.,1355788800,,125,4.25
4099464,3,B0039ZBM78,"I love the Wheels of the Bus version on this DVD.  Much smoother and classier than the YouTube ones, but my only drawback is that the rest of the 6 songs (up to 7 total) are as follows: 4 read stories with musical background and 2 songs like the Wheels of the Bus (which is really what I was expecting).

With this being said, not really worth the $12.81 that I paid but my 18 month old loves the Wheels of the bus...",1355184000,3,417,4.0120481927710845
4099465,2,B0039ZBM78,"This was not the DVD I thought I had ordered. I thought it had Dem Bones on it, a wonderful teaching tool on the human skeleton. I didn't like these renditions of the stories. As a music specialist, I expect higher quality then this from Scholastic.",1353888000,2,249,4.434782608695652
4099466,5,B0039ZBM78,"He loves to watch this and sings/talks along with it.
He is three.
I am not even sure of the reason for the appeal..??",1353196800,,118,3.9583333333333335
4099467,5,B0039ZBM78,My daughter wasn't interested in any of the Scholastic DVDs until she was a few month past her2 year birthday. Now she loves them. I like them because they get her interested in stories.  When we read the books together she acts out what she has seen on the DVD.  Makes it fun for both of us. We own both Wheels on the Bus DVDs (blue and red) because they have different stories on each DVD.  I assume she will enjoy these for years to come.,1345507200,,441,4.104651162790698
4099468,5,B0039ZBM78,This is a Great DVD!! My grandson really loves to watch this! I would highly recommend this for anyone 2+ years. :),1339027200,,115,4.2727272727272725
4099469,5,B0039ZBM78,"My two sons love this book - they are 3 years old and 2 years old.  The text is colorful, and the incorporation of movement is very clever.  There are several stories within the story, so there is a lot to notice each time you go through it.  The only problem with the book is that we cannot leave our boys alone with it - they completely demolish all the moving parts - this has happened twice.  So don't leave the book out where toddlers can play with it solo!",1316390400,,462,4.1

8392570,2,B0039ZBM78,Beware that this is an actual musical production of the song and not like the ones you may be accustomed to via youtube.,1490400000,,120,4.260869565217392

8392579,5,B0039ZBM78,My grandson loves this song so I bought the DVD for him. The best part is that it's the Bacon brothers who sing the song-great! The rest is very good too but that's our favorite. An excellent purchase.,1370476800,4,201,4.315789473684211
