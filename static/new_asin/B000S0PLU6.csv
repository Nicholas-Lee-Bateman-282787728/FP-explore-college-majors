2878116,4,B000S0PLU6,"Not to claim that Larry Davis was an angel because he was a walking demon, but his brutal lifestyle was mirrored to that of the NYPD.  As one knows not all officers of law are corrupt.  Having said that the depth of crooked officers that set out to kill this man and the attempt to off his family was a eye openner, but all to real for those who live in the hood.  They police fueled his drug trade and when he wanted to opt out of the lifestyle of a drug dealer they wanted him dead and their money back.  This one needs to be made into a movie.  Forget American Gangster (although a great flick) this Larry Davis story would make millions money and bring an awareness to the corruption of certain police and the final end of individuals for getting into the drug game.  This is a must see!",1200096000,8,791,4.171052631578948

8203583,5,B000S0PLU6,Very interesting documentary on the life of Larry Davis.  I remember I was around 12 in the 8th grade when the whole thing went down. It was all over the news and in the papers.

8203586,1,B000S0PLU6,"Left Wing Propaganda! Mr. Davis should stay in jail for the rest of his useless life, especially since though he shot numerous white police officers, those that he was accused of killing were men of color. The only bright spot was that his ""Limousine Liberal"" attorney, Bill is now deceased. The video is a waste of time and money.",1391817600,,331,4.627118644067797

8203589,5,B000S0PLU6,"This is very typical all over this country and world. It's SIMPLE, ask yourself where are the drugs coming from?!? I can tell you it's definitely not ""Blacks"" (Hebrew Yisraelites) but they exploit the Hebrew people's plight which forces the weak to affiliate themselves with the poisons trying to make a living but we end up dead or jailed (matt 24:9)(luke 21:12). This is the continuation of MANY wedges driven into Hebrew families keeping them NUMB to their enslavement (rom 8:36). It's a VERY VICIOUS CYCLE that stems from economic castration and miseducation of our religions/books and literature/schools/universities/world governments/all police departments/elite world banks/the media/friends and family/the vatican and other evil agencies worldwide (deut 28:1-68). God was surely with Larry Davis and his family throughout this attempt assassination! I really hope many people especially ones who are pushing these poisons in our communities would wake up and take full responsibility of our lives/families/environments! I commend Larry Davis for not panicking and always thinking rationally through-out this whole ordeal and NOT allowing the ""BEAST"" to murder him and ""they"" write/create the ending as ""they"" DO and have DONE. The Hebrew Yisraelites/""Blacks""+Browns have and are enduring many forms enslavement since their existence on this oppressive evil land! But it is written in the old and new testaments that God our father will deliver his children of faith again from a house of bondage! peace!",1296604800,4,1511,5.545454545454546
