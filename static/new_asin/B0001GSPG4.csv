1999544,1,B0001GSPG4,"Words can't describe how ludicrous and painful the whole ""Snowbeast"" experience is. Retailing at around $4.00, this is one of the most overpriced DVDs that I have ever seen.

The concept is that a Bigfoot-like monster is haunting a Colorado ski resort immediately prior to the annual ""winter carnival,"" and is shredding the skiers. This movie, made for TV in 1977, is such a blatant ""Jaws"" knockoff that I imagine the only reason the makers of ""Jaws"" didn't sue, was because they were convulsing with laughter. Where to start? Well the music is as good as any other place...it is a wonderful tribute to the ""Jaws"" score; the ""we have to close the beach"" theme from ""Jaws"" transmogrifies into ""we have to close the winter carnival""; instead of the shark scuttling the boat, the creature rolls a bunch of logs down a hill and knocks a camper out of commission (!); and instead of the lucky shot to the oxygen tank blowing the shark up in a man versus beast finale, there is a ridiculous twist (that made me groan out loud) involving a tree, a ski pole, a hill, and a very silly camera angle from the point of view of the Bigfoot. These aren't all the parallels, but you can have the fun of spotting the rest.

Believe it or not, the screenplay for this mess was written by the same guy who wrote ""Psycho"" for Hitchcock, Joseph Stefano. This is not his best work. The story is ludicrous, and in addition to the standard monster stuff, includes a love triangle subplot, a greed subplot, and much, much more.

All this brings me to the monster himself. This is, simply put, the lamest monster I have seen since Phil Tucker's ""Robot Monster."" Normally we can only see one paw of the creature reaching around things at us (Scary!), and there is one shot where you can see him grabbing a guy and you can clearly see where the monster glove stops and the human arm begins. Occasionally you also get to see a close up shot of the monster's mask, but the only time you ever get to see the monster as an entire entity is from very far away, when he is indistinguishable from, say, a spider monkey, or even Napoleon Bonaparte. The point here isn't to make fun of spider monkeys or the French; it is to say that this film is a piece of cheese, and rank, runny, smelly cheese at that. A particular effect you will grow to know and loathe is after each killing (since we only get to see the monster paw and the victim in frame at once) the paw turns red in the one not-so-special effect in the movie. (This signals a commercial break.)

In summary, this movie would have been perfect fodder for MST3K, but watching it as is makes for a painful night of entertainment. This movie is for hardened bad movie buffs only. Perhaps the box for the DVD sums it up best when it simply says ""Big Foot - Loch Ness Monster - Abominable Snowman - Snowbeast!"" Right.

1999566,2,B0001GSPG4,"While the movie itself is great (it's been a favorite of mine since childhood), this DVD is definitely NOT remastered in any way. It's the same version that's been floating around in various public domain compilation sets: grainy/fuzzy and washed out. As with all those versions, there's a very, very brief scene missing which I was hoping would be included in this remastered set. But nope, it isn't there.

I first saw this flick when I was a kid of eleven and it scared the crap out of me, living in the country as we did with woods all around.  If you don't get your expectations up too high, you'll probably enjoy this classic ""bigfoot in the snow"" flick.  You may laugh, as my wife did, when they show the monster's face at one point but it's really not bad considering 1977 and no CG, just old fashion movie making.  Since it was made for TV I just thought they did a good job of making it kinda scary with the limitations of made for TV movies.

The plot is pretty simple, ""Bad Monster Attacks People"". The ""monster"" is NOT a ""classic"" or ""traditional"" bigfoot.  This allows the production to get away with a scary monster that's not trying to ""live up"" to the bigfoot look.  I think that what makes this movie work is the ""scare-factor"" the producers had to come up with for a TV-Movie and not one going to the theaters. The ""digitally remastered"" version here doesn't really do much, and that is a disappointment.  It looks pretty much like all the other cuts I've seen - But the price is reasonable and if you want to add it to your collection, this is a good way to go.  It's better than a lot of the ""bigfoot"" movies out there and is a ""fun"" flick...If you like this sort of thing.

1999662,5,B0001GSPG4,"This is a sentimental favorite because it evokes a certain period in time.  It's a made for TV movie (there are brief blackouts where the commercials would have been inserted, there was no attempt to smooth out the transitions).  The monster in question is not identified as Bigfoot but as something not human and not animal.  It's never fully seen in all its splendor, just glimpses of it.  The filmmakers favored heavy breathing, the occasional roar or growl, and POV shots through the trees as the `monster' spies on its victims.  There are no kills shots, no bodies shown, just enough blood so you get the idea.  They `suggest' rather than show anything.  The plot is vaguely familiar.  It concerns a ski resort and the town's annual winter carnival.  The owner of the resort (Sylvia Sidney as Carrie Rill) is overly anxious that the carnival play out as intended.  She is more than a little miffed that a skier had the gall to go missing and when it's reported that she's dead, old lady Rill happily suggests that they kind of cover it up for the time being.  ""I'm not being insensitive.""  Said as she delivers a veiled threat to her grandson (Robert Logan as Tony Rill) to cover it up.  As if that wasn't enough, they introduce an old triangle of sorts, Tony's ex-girlfriend (Yvette Mimieux) who dumped him for Gar Seberg (Bo Svenson), a former gold medal Olympics champion in need of a job.  Soon, it's up to the sheriff, the grandson, and this husband and wife team to put a stop to all the killing.

I wouldn't exactly classify this as horror movie (monster notwithstanding); it's more of a suspense thriller (albeit watered down).  It also serves up far too many skiing sequences to suit me.  But the actors are all amiable.  The plot is tried and true (having been used often in a variety of films).  It's old enough that it scores on nostalgia alone.

The transfer is iffy and the sound isn't the greatest (I had to turn the volume on my TV to 100 % in order to hear the dialog).",1425513600,,1991,4.523809523809524

1999664,4,B0001GSPG4,"This is one of those old made for TV movies where your imagination is required to fill in for where budgetary and script limitations tend to let you down a little.

There is a pretty neat movie at the heart of this, a kind of Jaws at a Ski Resort during a Winter Festival. Instead of a Great White Shark we get a big white Bigfoot with a craving for ski bunnies.

It has a pretty decent cast of fun to watch actors, with Yvette Mimieux kind of a stand-out, as a TV Reporter with a Bigfoot past, who looks quite fetching in her form fitting ski suit.

You've also got Robert Logan, (he was a regular on 77 Sunset Strip and also the old Daniel Boone TV series), looking here like a TV stand-in for Warren Beatty. He's the fellow that runs the Ski Resort under the watchful eye of his Grandmother (played by Sylvia Sydney, who'd been hot stuff back in her 1930s film career, and stuck around for years and years as a talented character actor). In SNOWBEAST she kind of has the same function as the Mayor of Amityville in JAWS. After the first Ski Bunny 'disappears', with all signs pointing to a hungry white Bigfoot, she tries to cover things up. It's is the 50th Annual Winter Festival after all, and who wants to scare away customers?

Of course the film's real draw, casting wise, is the chance to see Bo Svenson and Clint Walker in the same production. Both of these guys look to be about eight feet tall. Spoiler: although you'd expect these giants to battle it out War of the Gargantuas style at some point, that unfortunately never happens.

Bo Svenson plays the film's main hero, a sensitive former Olympic Ski champion, the husband of Yvette Mimieaux's character, who has been in a rut since winning a string of Gold Medals in the '68 Olympics. After all his success he'd put away his skis because he didn't want anyone to think of him as a 'has-been' (70s era psychology I guess). Yvette Mimieux is clearly bored by this early on, a bigger issue for Bo, especially with the Warren Beatty look alike Robert Logan having some romantic back-story with her.

Clint Walker is under used in the film in my opinion. He plays the local Sheriff (one imagines that any local bad guys have long since moved away out of respect for this colossus with a badge). He does (spoiler) get to deliver one of the film's best lines, after finding the first victim stuffed into the hayloft of an old barn (it seems the monster likes to store his Ski Bunny left-overs for later snacking, kind of like the giant Croc in that movie ROGUE), anyway Clint calls Robert Logan to the scene to hopefully help him to ID the body. Logan says ""Maybe if I get a look at her face"" and Clint deadpans ""Well she doesn't have one"". Great stuff for monster movie fans.

One of the film's other big highlights is an Altmanesque (or is it Michael Ritchiesque?) sequence that features the Snowbeast making a direct attack on the Winter Festival. Sylvia Sydney takes a spill here that looks like an accident more than a stunt. There's a bit where we see the Snowbeast's face looking through a window that made me think of the gremlin on the wing of the plane in that old Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner. Cool creepy stuff.

This TV movie was written by Joesph Stefano who'd previously worked on THE OUTER LIMITS and ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS. He might be best known for writing the screenplay for PSYCHO. Later in his career (post-SNOWBEAST) he would adapt the SWAMP THING franchise for a TV series.

So if you enjoy TV horror films from the 1970s, and are willing to fill in some of the blank spots here with your own imagination, then you will likely find this to be quite enjoyable. It does have its faults, the wrap-up could've been more exciting. There were some very good opportunities here for a few last minute surprises (I'm thinking about Clint Walker's role in the film) that are unfortunately wasted.

On the technical side I think the version(s) available via Amazon Prime have had their color pushed up a bit (remastered) resulting in a little visual harshness occasionally. You can find somewhat faded prints of this on you tube.

Also there is another, more recent film with the same title, and what appears to be pretty much the same kind of white monster bigfoot, that looks like one of those SyFy films (not sure).

1999721,3,B0001GSPG4,"A feature of made-for-television movies beginning in the 1970s was loading up on B-list and former A-list actors.  The most awarded actor in this 1977 movie is Oscar nominee Sylvia Sidney, who was awesome at the end of her career as Grandma Florence Norris in ""Mars Attacks.""  Bo Svenson, a veteran actor of dozens of movies and television shows, including ""Kill Bill 2"" and ""Heartbreak Ridge,"" plays a former skiing champion looking to redeem himself.  Yvette Mimieux, who I will always remember as Weena in the original, and better, ""The Time Machine,"" as well as Dr. Kate McRae in ""The Black Hole,"" is Svenson's faithful wife.  Robert Logan, who was quite popular in the 1960s and 1970s and starred in a number of films about a family living in the wilderness, is part of the family that runs the ski resort where the snowbeast appears.  Then there is the sheriff, played by Clint Walker, who was the star of ""Cheyenne"" in the late 1950s and early 1960s and had an up and down career appearing in films such as ""Killdozer"" and ""The Dirty Dozen.""

The snowbeast makes an auspicious appearance at the beginning of the movie by attacking, and apparently eating, a beautiful young female skier.  The skier's friend skis away as quickly as possible to try to get help (too late!) and to warn everyone about the monster.

Then follows the interlude where no one believes the report of the beast, followed by the realization that there is a beast, especially after the beast appears at a school and breaks in a window.  This scene then sets up the exciting climax where our heroes set off into the wilderness to track down the beast and, with a little luck, kill it.

Sadly, we only get to see brief glimpses of the snowbeast.  On the other hand, since the budget for this movie was likely minimal, keeping the appearance of the snowbeast to a minimum was likely a wise and effective move.  It is better to see less of a cheesy costume.  In this movie, the parts we do see are a bit scary.  I loved it when the monster's face appeared in the window, which may have been the scariest scene in the entire movie.

In the monster subgenre of the horror genre, most monsters have ended up in some awful movies.  Somehow, big foot, Yeti and other snow-related beasts seemed, to me, to fare better than most other monsters in that many of the directors of these low-budget films have used their monsters very carefully and effectively.  Such is the case in this movie.  Much of the time we see events through the snowbeast's eyes, so we know where it is in relationship to victims as well as hunters.  These scenes often make you want to yell ""run!""  We also see partially obscured or brief glimpses of the snowbeast that tantalize us while avoiding overexposure of a potentially cheesy costume.

I do have two minor complaints about this movie.  The first is the clich&eacute; subplot regarding several of our main characters.  In this case, there are a couple of subplots.  One is a former relationship between two of our heroes before she married another of our heroes.  The other subplot is the need for one of the main characters to find redemption for some supposed failure or psychological issue.  My other complaint is the clich&eacute; involving how the monster catches victims.  In every case our victims fall, stop, and in one case, sit, waiting for the monster to grab them.  When people fight back or run, they generally live.  There is a moral in there somewhere.  On the other hand, if people did not do stupid things, how would the monster eat?

There are not very many movies featuring shaggy creatures running around in the snow and attacking people, so if you enjoy these kinds of movies you have to watch this one.  Even better is that the director handled his monster reasonably well using the ""less is more"" philosophy, though I would have liked to have seen the entire creature at least once.  Even the acting seems better than average for this type of movie, which should hardly be a surprise given the experience of the main characters.  This movie is one that you should consider watching if you have yet to see it.  You may find that you want to keep this one in your library.

Sidenotes:  The picture and the sound are reasonably good, though not remastered.  I believe this film is in the public domain, so it is unlikely that anyone will remaster it any time soon.

1999735,4,B0001GSPG4,"Yes, it's one of the many cheap ripoffs of Jaws that came along in the 70's, with dialogue that is often hard to listen to with a straight face.  Yet, after first seeing ""Snowbeast"" on TV when I was a kid, there are still some elements in this film that make it enjoyable to watch.  It's what I like to call a cheese popcorn movie...it won't do anything for you but it does taste good.
So what do I like about it?  For starters, there's the lovely Yvette Mimieux, a little-known blonde goddess from the early 60's.  Here, as a brunette, she almost resembles Jackie Kennedy and is clearly the best actor in the film.
Secondly, and especially for a TV movie, the cinematography is quite nice.  Filmed in Gunnison County, Colorado, the beautiful skiing sequences (the best of which has Bo Svenson's character skiing alone at night) and mountain scenery are alone worth giving this movie a look.
Lastly, as one of the limited genre of ""Bigfoot films"", this is one of the better ones.  That may not be saying much but it does rank the film a notch above its peers, within a category that includes some truly awful movies.
No, it is not in the same league as the Steven Spielberg film that inspired it, but it certainly is not the worst 90 minutes I've ever spent.",1262476800,,1258,4.447826086956522
1999736,3,B0001GSPG4,"""Snowbeast"" is a 1977 TV movie filmed a year after the popular ""Jaws.""

It's got quite a few positives: Gorgeous alpine locations -- filmed at Crested Butte Mtn Ski Resort, Colorado; a very likable 70s cast, including Robert Logan, Bo Svenson, Yvette Mimieux and Clint Walker; and a decent-looking malevolent Sasquatch for a TV film of that era, although you barely get to see him.

Unfortunately the film lacks originality as the plot rips off ""Jaws"" verbatim. The only difference is that it takes place at a ski resort rather than a beach and the monster is a sasquatch rather than a shark. Like ""Jaws"" there's a scene where a bear is hunted and killed, making the skiers think the slopes are safe again, but the main characters know it's not the culprit; one of them even states that the dead bear's stomach should be opened up to see if human remains can be found. I hope Peter Benchley got royalties! Despite the similarities, ""Snowbeast"" lacks the suspense and pizzazz of ""Jaws;"" in fact, it's kinda boring, but well worthwhile if you're in an alpine mood and/or if you're a fan of the four stars. After all, any film with Clint Walker can't be all bad; plus Yvette looks real cute in a tight ski outfit.

The film runs 97 minutes.

FINAL SAY: I've seen ""Snowbeast"" three times now and always enjoy it despite its lack of originality and slightly lethargic spirit. It's a must for devotees of the Bigfoot mythos, as well as fans of the cast and those wanting to see great alpine locations. Just keep in mind it's a 70's TV movie.

The acting as well is beyond reproach, which places Snowbeast at the top of the genre canon. Robert Logan, as Tony Rill, a veritable Hammer of Yeti's, is sublime. His cool demeanor, fitted ski suit, and Ted Bundy hairdo, bespeaking his proactive, ""it must be destroyed,"" aggressive anti-Yeti campaigning. And Bo Svenson, excellent as Gar, the has-been ski champion-cum-pacifist turned conscientious Yeti slayer, has some classic cuckold moments as Tony casually seduces his very sexy and equally disillusioned wife Ellen (the petite, and yet fantastically busty, Yvette Mimieux).

A quick aside: In regard to the creature itself, though I refer to it as a Yeti per it's being white furred, and while it is never positively identified in the film, but rather implied as being a malevolent ""Bigfoot"" that has wandered out of the wilderness and into the resort area, the creature is in fact more closely akin to that described by the ""... weather beaten old mountain hunter, named Bauman."" A creature which stalked him, and murdered his trapping partner, in the lonely mountain pass with the evil reputation. ""... Something either half human or half devil, some great goblin-beast."" As told first-hand to then president Theodore Roosevelt, and recounted in his 1892 classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wilderness-Hunter/dp/0760756031/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wilderness Hunter</a>.

<Spoiler Alert> The only real problem I have with the film, while minor in the extreme, is what I like to call the Snowbeast ""Magic Logs"" theory. This is in reference to the creature's attack on a motor home, wherein it rolls a huge pile of logs down an embankment crashing broadside into said motor home, knocking it over, but these ""Magic Logs"" (in full defiance of the laws of physics, and more so, film continuity) inexplicably manage to end up INSIDE the motor home, thereby trapping Sheriff Paraday (the uber-manly, Clint Walker), and literally securing his demise.

All said: If you are a fan of any of the classic, non-CGI, Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti genre films, then Snowbeast (1977), a true masterpiece of the genre will most assuredly take it's place as a cherished part of your collection.

1999740,3,B0001GSPG4,"If you grew up in the 70's like me you remember that phrase well. In a time before cable and V.C.R.'s, us old timers had to watch what came on and even had to go to the T.V. to change the channel(unless you could afford the high priced remote T.V.'s of the day). Every Friday night children like myself were treated to an episode of ""The Night Stalker"" (The best show ever to me at the age of 11) and at least one or two horror movies. ""Snowbeast"" was one of about five movies that showed up regularly on those long ago nights(""Shock waves, ""The Devil's Rain"", ""Race With The Devil"" ,and ""Terror At 37,000 Feet"" rounded out the others) and at least every three to four months one would play.

  The story, about a Bigfoot like snow monster was played as ""Jaws"" in the snow. At the age of 11 this movie was silly,but very cool and even scary at times.

Well I'm not 11 anymore and most of the scares are very lame now, but i still felt some magic as this piece of cheese unfolded in front of me.

1999742,2,B0001GSPG4,"Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) brought about a number of things, the first and foremost being an unprecedented level of worldwide success, the second being a few sequels (including one in 3-D), and last but not least a plethora of generally cheap imitations just itching to leech off the gravy train, in this case a lackluster, made for TV feature titled Snowbeast (1977).  I should mention I don't necessarily mind Hollywood's continual cannibalization in order to squeeze every bit of profit from a premise as possible, but I do mind overly obvious, lacking in effort rip offs, such as we have here.  Directed by Herb Wallerstein (""I Dream of Jeannie"", ""The Brady Bunch"", ""The Six Million Dollar Man""), the telefeature stars Bo Svenson (North Dallas Forty, Heartbreak Ridge), Yvette `Weena' Mimieux (The Time Machine, Where the Boys Are), and Clint Walker (The Dirty Dozen, Yuma, Killdozer).  Also appearing is Robert Logan (The Adventures of the Wilderness Family, Mountain Family Robinson) and Sylvia Sidney (Madame Butterfly, Blood on the Sun), whom I best remember as the character Juno, the chain-smoking social worker in the afterlife from Tim Burton's Beetle Juice (1988).

As the movie begins we see a couple of female skiers shushing down the mountain.  One of them wants to turn back because she feels uneasy, but the other thinks she's being foolish...guess who gets it?  Back at the lodge preparations are underway for the annual winter carnival, including the hanging of a banner stating ""A day and night weeks orgy of fun and games""...well all right...Tony Rill (Logan), the manager, gets word one of his guests has gone missing, and he organizes a search party.  After finding a bloodied and tattered ski jacket, the surviving girl relates a tale of how a monster got her friend.  Tony's grandmother (Sidney) wants to keep things hush hush, as not to spoil the upcoming events.  Soon Tony's friend and washed up former Olympic gold medalist skier Gar Seberg (Svenson) makes the scene with his wife Ellen (Mimieux), as Gar is hoping to land a job at the resort.  I should probably mention Ellen is a television journalist, one who just happened to do a story on Bigfoot not too long ago.  Soon the missing skier's body is found (sans her face), and Sheriff Cole Paraday (Walker) makes the scene.  As the creature claims another couple of victims, Ellen begins snooping around, and Tony, the Sheriff, and Gar make plans to eliminate the growing threat (Gar the pacifist was against the idea at first, but after seeing the remains of the mutilated woman, he's all on board now).  After an attack on a school gymnasium during the crowning of the snow queen (and yet another murder), Sheriff Paraday, Tony, Gar, and Ellen decide to head up the mountain and kill the murderous beast once and for all, but it ain't that easy as the creature is smart, smart enough to trash their camper and steal their weapons...the hunters have now become the hunted, and it seems like nothing, nothing human at least, is going to make it off that mountain alive...

Snowbeast is pretty much what you might think it is, a forgettable TV made knock off whose only intent at the time was to capitalize on the popularity surrounding the films Jaws.  If there was any doubt in my mind towards this, it was satisfied during one, particular sequence.  At one point news gets around the sheriff bagged the creature responsible for the deaths.  Turns out he ended up killing a bear (most of the population wasn't aware exactly what was responsible for the recent maulings), the intent being to put the townspeople and tourists minds at ease.  Gar and Ellen happen to be on hand, and they have a good idea the bear wasn't the creature responsibly for the recent spate of deaths due to the fact they only just recently had a run in with the real monster.  Gar suggests to the sheriff they cut the dead bear's stomach open, and see what it had been eating, as to verify if in fact it truly is killer.  If you've seen the film Jaws, you'll recall a very similar scene after a large shark is captured.  Oh, and let's not forget the cover up perpetrated to ensure the carnival goes off without a hitch and tourist dollars keep flowing...anyway...between the seemingly excessive amount of padding shots (skiing and snowmobile sequences), there is something of a story, populated by a lame group of characters.  The script really isn't very good, and features some painfully forced drama, particularly between the characters of Gar, Ellen, and Tony (seems Ellen and Tony had a history before she chose to marry Gar).  This sets up a really unintentionally funny uncomfortable moment as Tony comments on Ellen's beauty right in front of Gar, who can't really say anything since he's come to the resort in hopes of find a job.  Another fine example of the excremental scripting comes when Gar finally relates to Ellen why he hasn't picked up a pair of skis since he won the gold during a not so recent Olympics...ugh (where's that damn face ripping sasquatch when you really need him?).  Yvette Mimieux is worth hanging around for, as she's just as hot in the mid 1970s as she was when she appeared in the film The Time Machine (1960), but at a diminutive 5' 4"", she must have felt miniscule among the cast given the prominent male actors in the film were all six feet plus (Logan was 6' 3"", Svenson 6' 4"", and Walker a whopping 6' 6"").  Given the gigantism of the male leads, I kept hoping for a scene where at least one of them got into a hand to hand battle with the Bigfoot monster, but it never happened.  There are a few, extremely brief shots of the creature, but otherwise everything else is limited to endless point of view shots, lots of growling, and ominous musical cues as the creature stalks its prey.  There's virtually no blood anywhere to be found, but that not surprising given this was intended for television audiences (so much so you can see the obvious commercial break insert points as various scenes fade out, in blood red, no less).  About the only reason to check this feature out is to see Yvette Mimieux in a tight snowsuit, but other than that, the movie is about as much fun as smacking yourself in the forehead with a two by four.

The picture quality, presented in fullscreen, on this Legacy Entertainment DVD release is fairly rotten.  It's grainy, muddled, and I wouldn't doubt if the original source here was a VHS tape.  The audio, which is supposedly in Dolby Digital, isn't much better, as the first hour its very soft, almost impossible to hear at times.  After an hour, it kicks up dramatically, for whatever reason (make sure to have the remote handy about an hour in, especially if you've got the volume cranked).  There are no extras included, but there are chapter stops.

8012424,3,B0001GSPG4,"Silly, fun made-for-tv 1970s horror. In no way shape or form on par with classics like Don't Be Afraid of the Dark and The Night Stalker, or even the lesser-known but still fun Horror at 30,000 Feet;  but if you grew up in that eara and had a fondness for these movies as a kid, and/or understand and appreciate the 1970s made-for-tv horror sensibility, you might find it a worthy way to spend an hour and a half, especially if you have some laundry to fold, or something, while watching.",1513900800,,488,4.4222222222222225

8012429,3,B0001GSPG4,"I bought this movie out of a sense of sweet nostalgia. I remember first seeing it as a prepubescent youth, and having the bejeebers scared out of me. In fact, I was sufficiently spooked to avoid cross-country skiing or snowshoeing alone for several years after. Upon watching it again some 40 years later, I was struck by how bland it actually is. It's not a terrible movie, but it isn't great, either. Even the likes of Clint Walker and Sylvia Sidney cannot rescue the lame dialogue and the slightly ridiculous premise. Many have commented that Joe Stefano (of Psycho fame) penned the screenplay, but all I have to say is, even talented artists sometimes have to bastardize themselves in order to put food on the table. The only reason I gave this three stars instead of two is that it's still fun to watch with a group of friends late at night, over a cheap bottle of something intoxicating.",1507507200,,893,4.622641509433962
