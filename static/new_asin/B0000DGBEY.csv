1924460,5,B0000DGBEY,"Don't believe any of the negative reviews written about the 4th season of Babylon 5. I think this is the 2nd greatest season of the series. Lots of plot twists, action and resolution to many of the series' storylines. Earth vs. Babylon 5, Vorlons vs. the Shadows, the fate of Mr. Mordon, the ascendence of Sheridan and Delenn, and the departures of some very endearing characters. Babylon 5, Season 4 has it all. Buy this DVD set!",1072396800,3,430,4.597402597402597
1924461,1,B0000DGBEY,"it isn't what you expect of the details,it has too much techinical errors,it was far least than i expected,such a huge
dissapointment for me as a long time fan of babylon,star gate
and many other sci-fi's the DVD resolutions are good but it isn't enough the quality and the scripts aren't as they used to be..",1072310400,,309,4.535714285714286
1924462,5,B0000DGBEY,"J Michael Strazynski (an avowed atheist if memory serves) offers up a most compelling myth with Babylon 5 overall and Season 4 in particular. He explores the themes of both Creation and the Messiah and he does so in a way that is both intelligent and believable. Aside from creating a science fiction tour de force, JMS has offered a provocative essay on the age old questions of where we came from and why we are here. Or to use a B5-ism ""Who are you?"" ""What do you want?"". These are the questions that have inspired/plagued humankind for millennia; we have invented gods and religions to explain these questions, and men great and small have used god and religion to build and destroy throughout history. JMS hasn't just created great science fiction he has imposed upon his viewers the moral burden of answering those questions and given them gripping insight as to the importance of the answers.
If all of this is a little too heady rest assured that Babylon 5: Season 4 is science fiction at its best. Winner of multiple awards including Hugos and Nebulas (not to mention a slew of  Emmys), Babylon 5 is probably the finest science fiction ever produced for television, and I am speaking as an old line Star Trek fan who remembers the first run of the original series.
For those who want tightly written, fast-paced, hard hitting sci-fi look no further than Babylon 5. For those who desire a journey into the meaning of the human condition B5 is worth very serious attention. It is a moving and exhilarating blend of story-telling and philosophy in the great tradition of the Greek morality plays.",1070668800,12,1602,4.701067615658363
1924463,5,B0000DGBEY,"Despite not being released yet..i have seen all of Season 4 so this review is only on the grounds of the episodes and story writing.
This is one superb season. You witness the latter end of the Shadow war which comes to a fantastic conclusion and the rebellion against the new regime now based on earth under the control of President Clark unfolds into an all out war. This season has spectacular battles all throughout and will tug at nearly ALL of your emotions from great anger to sandess and despair.
I recommend buying this DVD once its released!
5 out of 5 stars!",1070582400,4,569,4.480769230769231
1924464,5,B0000DGBEY,"The fourth season of Babylon 5 wraps up the series admirably, and in my view is much stronger than season five.  If not for ""Sleeping in Light"" it would be fine if the entire series ended with ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"".
The season itself is very tight.  There isn't a lot of non-arc stuff, which is fine with me.  Of the many subplots and loos ends that get resolved, look for Londo to sink even deeper into darkness while in Emperor Cartagia's court.  The Minbari civil war comes to a head, with a very unexpected outcome for both the war and for Neroon.
The acting is more than adequate.  Of particular note, Wortham Krimmer is fantastic as the sadistic and depraved Emperor Cartagia.  Andreas Katsulas has never been better as Citizen G'Kar.
We understand the reason for the Shadow/Vorlon conflict...if if you don't know what the reason is, stay tuned...you might just find yourself agreeing with the Shadow point of view.
Looking forward to a good long acquaintance with this B5 season.",1068163200,42,1002,4.763005780346821
1924465,5,B0000DGBEY,Decades ahead of their time. Casting and writing is excellent. What I really enjoyed is the authors notes on the Babylon 5 website that give the back story and more. I am going to watch the series again once I complete it. If you love Star Wars this is just as good in my opinion. Some of the underlying themes and messages are like I said far ahead of its time.,1509235200,,362,4.112676056338028
1924466,5,B0000DGBEY,"This review is for the 2004 edition. Based on the other reviews, the 2009 edition is probably better. (check)

This is one of the best seasons of the show (the other was season 3), but it's also quite dark, although not as dark as the new Battlestar Galactica.  Since they didn't know they would get a fifth season, JM Straczynski moved his plots around so the Shadow War would be done after episode 6, with the rest of the season dedicated to the war against the corrupt Earth government.  Darkness: death and resurrection, creepy Lorien, an insane emperor (played like John Hurt's version of Caligula), bad Kosh (aka Ulkesh), the betrayal and torture of Sheridan, Garibaldi's, um...(spoiler deleted), sacrificing one life for another, and an apocalypse 500 years beyond 2261.  But through all the darkness, eventually victory is achieved.

Major new characters this season: Number One (Marjorie Monaghan) - leader of the Martian rebellion; Emperor Cartagia (Wortham Krimmer) spoken of but not seen in season 3, and Lorien, THE First One, played by Wayne Alexander, who was also Sebastian in season 2, ironically enough.

1924473,5,B0000DGBEY,"Babylon 5 was one of our favorite sci-fi series of all time. The entire five seasons hang together in a continuing drama with procedural episodes thrown in. That both serves to break the tension and add interest. If you are going to catch up on their series, you need to watch it all. And that is no strenuous task. It's great.

I admit it, I'm a sci-fi junkie. I'll give any sci-fi more than an even break, and that's what I did with Babylon V. I thought that the premise of the show sounded a bit trite and cliched. I thought that some of the first season episodes were somewhat lame. I wound up changing my mind on all of that. J. Michael Strazynski claimed to have a five year story arc in mind, and in the early days of this show I was highly suspicious of that claim. I'd seen it before and I'd been let down.

This first time through, I liked the show but I wasn't completely sold on it ... but I kept watching (see my first sentence). By the later seasons, I realized that JMS DID have a long term story arc going on, and he was living up to his promise. Events that seemed odd and poorly thought out the first time through suddenly made sense in the context of later plots. The show absolutely turned out to be unique in that there obviously was a long term plan from the planning stages of the show that was carried out through the course of the five seasons.

 I thought the show just got better and better through its run. The good news is that DVD sets for Babylon V have been out long enough that you can get great deals on them. I recently bought all five seasons for a total of sixty-five dollars ... thirteen bucks a season. That's a good deal in anyone's book. Unlike some TV series, you'll want to watch every season of this one. Some things that happen in season one don't really make sense until season five. Events in season five won't make much sense unless you watched season one.

Through the show, the acting is uniformly solid. As in many shows, actors grew into their roles over time, and so some of the performances in season one, especially in the first few shows, were a bit immature compared to later in the series. That's unavoidable in most cases, and not something that should hold you back from watching season one of this show. Highly recommended.",1498435200,,2284,4.327102803738318

1924502,5,B0000DGBEY,"I never watched this when it was on TV, I saw the first couple episode and ""bagged it"" - a couple of the characters were ""too eccentric"" for me, Kosh's costume makes sense only to the costumer, and the special effects were too cheap/obvious.  That being said, now, with wiser eyes, I keep in mind that the special effect in the 90s just were not up to today's standards and TV shows often don't have the budgets that movies have.

Too many people I know said the show was good.  So, I finally watched it - all of it.  The technical aspects of the production/delivery are adequate and, I forgave the costumer, more or less).  And I am actually fond of all the characters.

The  story line is great.  An example of what a good writer can do, if the network execs don't meddle too much.  The sequel series only made it one season - I never understood what network execs can't be happy with a good show that is popular, but not wildly popular.",1476921600,,939,4.32

1924548,5,B0000DGBEY,"The entire B5 series tells a great story arc over the 5 years.  But it is in season 4 where many of the key storylines come to their culmination.  I already had the complete B5 set, but discovered that most of the discs in my season 4 had some kind of damage at the layer shift, so I needed these as a replacement.  Fortunately, the set I bought on Amazon were perfect!",1455580800,,369,4.097222222222222

1924551,5,B0000DGBEY,The fourth & arguably the best of the  seasons. Conflicts in the galaxy and on Earth are resolved with great costs on both sides. Excellent performances by the entire cast. The casting of the then Mrs. Bruce Boxleitner as Sheridan's presumed dead wife Anna was brilliant. Walter Koenig as Psi Cop Bester was just AWESOME( no more sweet Chekov)! He also got a few episodes in Season 5. This entire series proved Bruce Boxleitner was NOT a wooden actor! Highly recommended to ALL sci-fi fans!,1454371200,,490,4.764705882352941

1924561,5,B0000DGBEY,"B5 is the best sci fi ever made in my opinion.  If you have not seen it, the first few episodes are a little slow, but if you hang in there you are rewarded with an amazing, mind blowing storyline, incredible acting, and phenomenal character development. Things will happen through the show that you  do not know what they mean, but as you progress, these past events are revealed and their significance.  I had to watch the series twice to really appreciate the early events that hinted at what was to come, there were so many.  The first ones are awesome and the ""first"" first one is amazing.  Very very sophisticated story here.  Characters who seem almost like buffoons in the beginning will morph into characters of incredible character and with unexpected out comes.",1446249600,,772,4.723880597014926

1924570,5,B0000DGBEY,"Creator / writer JM Straczynski wraps up the series with the end of the Shadow War and the tying up of loose ends on Earth.  The show has a tendency to be bombastic and talky at times, but I cant help but be impressed with the ambitious storytelling.  I was underwhelmed by the way the Shadow War wrapped up, but the defeat of President Clark and the assassination of the mad emperor on Centauri Prime concluded those story threads in a very satisfying fashion.  There is still one season to go, but this would have provided a very effective ending.",1436227200,,549,4.47

I love the Babylon 5 series.  Somehow, over the years, I lost Season 4.  I decided to order this over Amazon's digital network instead of buying the actual DVD's.  What a mistake.  The digital version is the worst quality I've ever seen.  If there's a way for me to get my money back I'm going to try.  I have digital versions of quite a few movies and I'm happy with all them, but not this one.  I realize it's SD, but it is like a copy of a copy of a copy of a VHS tape.  Buy the real thing!

Amazon has already refunded my account.  It took less than a day.  This is why I love using Amazon and will continue to in the future.  Thanks Amazon!!",1434585600,,714,3.978723404255319

It's the US first series ever to have a five-year story line from the beginning. Also the first TV show to use movie-like special effects graphics.

He is escorted by an enigmatic alien named Lorien who claims to be the first sentient in the Galaxy. The Vorlons join the Shadow War, but their policies become a great concern for Sheridan and the alliance when the Vorlons begin a slash and burn policy by destroying whole planets which they deem to have been ""tainted"" by contact from the Shadows. Babylon 5 search-out other powerful beings the First Ones to aid against both the Shadows and the Vorlons. Through all of this Sheridan and Delenn ratify their relationship and begin planning for a future together. This season, will cover a whole of story line where there are a quite a few story threads that come to the fore and for some this season is their conclusion.

In the season finale you get a vignette of scenes showing a future timeline 100, 500, 1000, and one million years depicting Babylon 5's permanent influence throughout history. The resultant is very satisfying and some ways grounding break approach to giving glimpse what is to be.

1924645,5,B0000DGBEY,"I didn't see this series until it was in reruns. After a few episodes, I was hooked. The acting is the best, the special effects and makeup are excellent (especially in light of the small budget of the show), and the overall storyline is excellent. That overall storyline was greatly influenced by the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, which I noticed more and more after the first season, but I'm a writer who has published a lot of Lovecraftian tales; the viewer isn't required to know anything about Lovecraft to follow this series. One of the later full-length films is blatantly a take-off on Lovecraft's ""Call of Cthulhu"", only it is set in space.

Some episodes fall short of the typical level of script quality, but generally the episodes are darn good and then some.

Trekies don't seem to take to this series, but I think it is great. It has spiritual undertones about the mystery and meaning of life and even good and evil; it speaks to the thinking viewer. It's not that ""Star Trek"" didn't appeal to thinkers, it just did it in a different way. I like both of these shows, but I prefer ""Babylon 5.""",1391644800,,1104,4.570707070707071

1924647,4,B0000DGBEY,finally!!! i have had seasons 1-3 since 2005 but for some reason never purchased 4 or 5. now i have them and can FINALLY continue the saga. good stuff.,1391299200,,151,4.241379310344827
1924648,5,B0000DGBEY,see my review on season one. Basically each season gets the same review from me. It was a great series and I still have a hard time watching the last episode when the end comes.,1390521600,,177,4.085714285714285
1924649,5,B0000DGBEY,"I have the full set, but Season 4 is the best of the 5 seasons. I still highly recommend getting the full series though. Many great shows with exceptional characters, great storylines, and well done CGI. Excellent mix of sci-fi, drama, and humor.",1390348800,,246,4.744186046511628
1924650,5,B0000DGBEY,Awesome season of a highly recommended series. I found it difficult to stop watching the episodes and go to sleep at an appropriate time.,1390176000,,137,4.75
1924651,5,B0000DGBEY,just not what I expected and pleasantly surprised. Anyone that loves this juonra of scifi will find this entire series exceptional.,1389398400,,131,5.285714285714286

1924653,4,B0000DGBEY,"The 4th Season is action packed and the best of the 5 Seasons. (If you can get through the first 3 episodes in Season 1, then the character development and storyline starts to engage you through the rest of the 5 Seasons.)",1386892800,,222,4.309523809523809
1924654,5,B0000DGBEY,"The best season of B5 (imho), plus some good commentary from the creative team. If you are already a fan of B5, I need say no more. But hey, new fans are born every day. Watch, and enjoy!",1385856000,,187,3.9473684210526314

1924657,5,B0000DGBEY,When the show was on the air it was unknown if it would have a fifth season. So the fourth season was a wrap up of story lines.  The writing was fantastically done.  Anyone who loves great scifi will find the entire series well done.  Season 4 culminated in the fantastic season wrap up final episode which was also a portend to the future if season 5 was cancelled by the producers. So all the story lines were completed by the end of season 4. Highly rewarding if you watch season 4 all the way through.,1382140800,,505,4.239583333333333

1924659,5,B0000DGBEY,"For ""Babylon 5,"" Season 4 was Frodo at Mount Doom. This was the big payoff we'd been waiting for.  Actually, that came mid-way through this season; ""the Scouring of the Shire"" was the rest of it, but that was a pretty good story, too.

Buying just one season of B5 is like buying only certain chapters from a book.  You have to buy all five season and watch them through, in order.  You'll appreciate it more.",1381190400,,409,4.342105263157895

At the time this aired on network TV (filled with commercials) I was unaware that there was a 5th season. My local network pulled the series after 4 seasons.

1924684,1,B0000DGBEY,"This is a review of episode 22: The Deconstruction of Falling Stars.

This episode is terrible.  Do you want to hear a bunch of news commentators jabber back and forth on an newscast about the importance of the sci-fi show that you're watching--the award-winning sci-fi show that seems to be fizzling out before your eyes?  Wondering how in the world it could be burning out in this way?  I mean, it was great in the middle of the 4th season.  But then...what happened?  It just wasn't that great all of a sudden.  Is this final episode REALLY the climax?!?

If you don't like watching news commentators banter against one another, perhaps you'd enjoy watching three boring college professors who know nothing about anything talk about the social significance of the history of Babylon 5?  No?  Sound boring?  Yes, I thought so.

Okay.  How about you watch some dictatorship puppet argue against Babylon 5 holographic representations about how justified that dictatorship is?  Sound weird and boring?  Okay.

How about watching some clergy wringing their hands in a rectory a thousand years from the exciting events of the show you started to love?  No?

So...you sound like you hate the idea of watching a show about people talking about your show.  If that's the case, then you can bet that episode 22 will suck big time for you.  How could this final episode of season 4 be so FUBAR?

Episode 22 is awful.  Avoid spending the $2 for the instant video.  If you have the CD collection, you can afford to skip it.  I assure you, it's not worth your time to watch.  I started off watching this thing, then got distracted by wikipedia.  An hour and a half later, I saw that I was halfway through the video, and so I skipped around until I reached the end.  Boring.",1362528000,,1762,4.636363636363637

Image my disappointment to find that 2 of the episodes on the disk #4 were damaged!  I may try renting this package from Blockbuster.  Love the show, hate the quality of the product.

1924697,5,B0000DGBEY,"Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season is over sixteen hours and was released on DVD on January 6, 2004. Season 4 is a combination of two seasons in one. J. Michael Straczynski did not know from Warner Brothers if there was going they were going to pick up season five. It was not till the end of season four. Season four was going to be the Shadow War and season five was going to be the Earth Civil War; so in season four you get the combination of two wars. In my opinion season four seemed the most rush season of them all; if you missed an episode then you might be lost. Also I felt there were more drama and less comedy this time around. Don't get me wrong some episodes did contain few laughs. Mainly am going to express my thoughts on what I did and did not like. What I did not like was the combination of two seasons in one, if just did not flow with me. Also what I hated was the Falling Toward Apotheosis Commentary by Bruce Boxleitner, Jerry Doyle, Peter Jurasik, and Patricia Tallman. To me it was basically four people shooting the breeze and not even commenting on the episode. At on point Peter Jurasik tries to explain what apotheosis is and everybody around him jumps in and interrupts him. Also there were long pauses between the four and you would hear the episode. What I did like was the Face of the Enemy Commentary by J. Michael Straczynski and Director Michael Vejar; that got more into the details of making that episode. Also for the first time the Special Features came with Celestial Sounds extra, a No Surrender, No Retreat Suite. Basically you shrink sixteen hours into six minutes, and for the first time a Gag Reel. Overall I feel that season four could have been better, but don't forget that J. Michael Straczynski did not know if there was going to be a fifth season. Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season gets an A-.

1924698,4,B0000DGBEY,"Fascinating, sometimes maddening mix of wonderful and silly,
intelligent and dumb, insightful and obvious.

At it's best it's the 'Wire' of science fiction, challenging
'Battlestar Galactica' for intelligence and emotional depth.

The weakest element of the show year to year is the numbers of episodes or
sections that felt like they got away from the core issues.
If this show could have been 12 episodes
a year instead of 22, as is the case with most current serialized series,
there would be a lot fewer episodes feeling lacking
in substance, as if the show were just marking time.

Season 4 pulled off the neat trick of having the series feel like it
answered it's whole core question that gave it a reason for being, only
to replace it with new story lines just as rich and strong. Again, it
was episode to episode how interesting and germane the stories were.

I wish the series was even more consistently great, but - in the end - it was
more than good enough.

P.S. To echo what others have written here, be careful with the special
features. They sometimes have a nasty habit of acting as spoilers and
giving away plot twists to come.",1347753600,,1144,4.643564356435643
1924699,2,B0000DGBEY,The product arrived in the prescribed time frame. However one of the dvd's was badly scratched and did not work. I realize it was a used item but I think they should have screened it and let people know that one of the dvd's was bad.,1342224000,,233,4.086956521739131

1924702,5,B0000DGBEY,"It was touch-and-go whether JMS would be able to complete this incredible series prior to the conclusion of Season 4, so this could have been written as an open-ended clifthanger that would entice Warner Brothers to hard-sell the production and distribution of a 5th season to all interested parties who owned independent television stations. Instead, the fourth season finale became a projection episode the likes of which I've never seen before - a series of video entries that project the future legacy of Babylon 5 and the people who set the course of future events in the Interstellar Alliance! One of the ""future entries"" contained a scene from a Season 5 episode, ""Phoenix Rising,"" that was being shown as an historical event that was Sunday-morning quarterbacked by ""scholars"" the way that commentary shows like ""The McLaughlin Group"" present their topics and issues. If only real-life pundit segments ended like the ""appearance from a surprise guest"" did!

Overall a surprise-filled package of stories that can literally stand the test of time as well as add foundations to future B5 stories that could be told long after JMS ""goes over the rim.""",1336089600,,1155,5.078947368421052

I was afraid that the effects would look cheesy compared to today's modern effects, but not bad at all. It feels like re-reading Lord of the Rings after years away, you can't wait until you get to see your favorite scenes over again. Good fun!",1332720000,,402,4.302631578947368
1924705,5,B0000DGBEY,"Unlike ""The Coming of Shadows"" and ""Severed Dreams"", ""The Long Night"" didn't win the Hugo Award.

It should have.

I have watched every episode of Babylon 5 at least three times, but I've lost count of the number of times I've watched this one.  ""The Long Night"" was not only Babylon 5's single best episode, but one of the finest hours of television ever created.  Everyone involved in the making of this episode deserves an award.

I won't give you a blow-by-blow account of the action (I've never understood why any reviewer would do that; ruin the viewer's enjoyment of a show he's encouraging you to watch), but almost all of the many threads in the B5 universe are headed toward their pinnacle.  Success or disaster awaits all of the players around every corner.

I *will* tell you that the most enjoyable part of the show is watching the Oscar-worthy performances of Peter Jurasik (as Londo Mollari), Andreas Katsulas (as G'Kar) and Wortham Krimmer (as Emporer Cartagia).  The subplot that revolves around Mollari's desperate attempt to save his homeworld from destruction by the Vorlons was a stroke of genius by series creator (and primary screenwriter) J. Michael Straczynski.  The action that takes place in ""The Long Night"" is the most eventful, and makes possible the final resolution that follows in ""Into The Fire"".

Bryan Cranston (best known for his role as Hal, the father in ""Malcolm  in the Middle"") has a guest role as White Star Captain Ericsson, and series regular Stephen Furst (Flounder in the funniest movie ever made, ""Animal House"") really chews the scenery here opposite Peter Jurasik.  Watching these two guys play off each other should be required viewing for anyone even thinking of becoming an actor.

1924716,4,B0000DGBEY,"Coming off the best of the 5 seasons in season 3, season 4 comes across as a rush job as if JMS felt convinced that the network was going to pull the plug on the whole thing and so we go through a lot of interesting storylines that unfortunately do not get the chance to play out properly.  Even so, this season would have been a great way to end the entire series with the final episode of a look back into time from a million years in the future.  Instead, as if JMS was surprised that B5 was given another year the fifth and last season comes across as bereft of ideas and one is left feeling that B5 carried on one season too long.  Still, the best storylines albeit rushed and almost feeling forced out are in season 4.  We get the assassination of the Centauri Emperor and G'Kar's torture but eventual liberation of Narn, the later abrupt and lame conclusion to the Shadow war which took so long to build up and yet to end so limply, the rebellion against Earth force and the establishment of the Planetary Alliance which as mentioned earlier would have been the ideal way to end the entire B5 series.

For this reason, while there is no faulting the content of the fourth season although it is overall less as good as seaon three, I do have an issue with the picture and sound quality which is poor although admittedly a lot better than for seasons 1 & 2. Even when watching this on a Blu-ray player that upscales to 1080p the improvement is slight and many imperfections like dirt, specks, white and black spots, some clear frames and many soft/blurred ones are obvious plus the Dolby 5.1 surround sound option doesn't quite make the most of the property as the sound is still pretty much coming from the front speakers.

I hear that Warner may be releasing the entire series on blu-ray soon and if so I do hope they don't stinge on this and take the full time and expense to make the many, many improvements that are needed to bring this close to what one could describe as blu-ray reference quality. I thought Star Trek TOS blu-ray did an admirable job in their recent release and if that kind of blu-ray quality can be done on a 40-year old master surely we can expect a whole lot better from a much, much younger master!

I wait with great anticipation to see what Warner has in store for a hopefully sci-fi blu-ray set to set the standard for the rest to follow.",1284681600,,2375,4.35972850678733

1924720,5,B0000DGBEY,"As most people who are interested in the 4th season probably know, Babylon 5 is considered to be one of the better science fiction shows ever on TV. This seasons does not disappoint. A number of story lines are resolved in this season and the stage is set for a somewhat new direction for the show in the 5th season. The only somewhat odd aspect to the show was that it was sort of designed to be the last season when they thought it would be so everything left to tell was compacted into one season. This means that one of the major story lines of the series up to that point, namely the Shadow War, gets resolved somewhat abruptly right in the middle of the season and then the second major story line, the political situation on Earth, gets resolved in the second. This makes for a very packed schedule in which the action never seems to stop. Some of the episodes, especially near the end are very emotional.

I would say that there were only a couple of things I didn't like. The first was how Captain Sheridan seems to go missing and then come back from the dead not once, but twice only to carry on almost as if nothing happened. The other thing I didn't like was the Minbari Civil War. It seemed almost like an afterthought tacked on as a background for a story about Delenn and the creation of a new Grey Council. Some people may also be disappointed about the departure of two popular characters at the end of the season. In any case, all of these things are very minor. This season is really one that will keep you at the edge of your seat and wanting to see what happens next. It ends up with a not-so-well-liked substitute season finale which imagines the impact of the new alliance in the future, but I personally kind of like the episode.

It seemed that things were very rushed to wrap up the Shadow War and the conflict with EarthGov, but as I understand it this was going to be the final season before it was unexpectedly extended for an additional season.

This season follows the excellent season 3 and only falls a little short because of the rushed pace. There are some great (and frustrating) character developments that has the B5 command staff and the various Ambassadors split up a lot of the time performing various missions. There are also a lot of well thought out ship-to-ship battles that work to show how much thought went into making this series believable.

Ultimately instead of the knock-down drag out we were expecting we get one of the most notorious cop-outs in recent television history.  As a consequence the final resolution of the Clark Administration while it is satisfactory happens much too quickly.

Then they got picked back up by TNT and he told so more story, but all the good material had been used. It's not bad, just not as good.)

The author wanted to do a real arc story with an epic sweeping scope. Seasons 2 to 4 tell that story and tell it very well.

Because he thought out the whole story from beginning to end the end result is a very tight plot that ends up having great meaning. I'm still wowed about how one of the scenes in the very first episode (after the pilot) turned out to be directly relevant to an episode shown years later.

1924729,4,B0000DGBEY,"When Warner Brothers renewed Babylon 5 for its fourth and supposedly penultimate season, they had a problem. B5 was one of a number of shows that had been commissioned as part of an attempt to create a new network out of a number of syndication stations, dubbed PTEN. PTEN collapsed during B5's third season, resulting in some legal and funding problems in getting the show to continue. Whilst its ratings remained decent (outperforming the rival Star Trek shows in some key markets), there was some discussion about if the show's modest success was worth the considerable effort and expense to keep it on the air. Producer J. Michael Straczynski was informed of this debate and decided to take drastic action. To protect the integrity of the series, he decided to collapse several long-running plot threads that had been planned to extend into Season 5 so they ended in Season 4 instead, and pull back on the foreshadowing for Season 5. This way, if Season 4 was the end, the show would have a decent amount of closure whilst simultaneously not making a fifth season an impossibility. Unfortunately, this meant that JMS would have to write all 22 scripts again himself, and also change the nature of how a B5 season works in terms of pacing.

Season 4 picks up a few days after thee events at the end of Season 3. Half the Galaxy is at war with the Shadows, but with the Shadow homeworld of Z'ha'dum apparently devastated in a nuclear strike and their ships regrouping, the alliance of worlds brought together by the B5 crew is collapsing as its members withdraw their ships to defend their homeworlds. Sheridan is feared dead amongst the ashes of the Shadow homeworld, Garibaldi is missing, Londo has been summoned to high office on Centauri Prime and the Vorlons seem to be preparing to go on the offensive, and not too concerned about collateral damage along the way.

This is B5 at its most serialised. Straight from the off, JMS rams the accelerator pedal right down and the Shadow War is concluded with almost indecent speed, whilst events on Earth and the Minbari homeworld are suddenly back brought into the limelight before the audience can pause for breath. It's certainly a different approach, and whilst the dropping of the irrelevant non-arc filler episodes is laudable, it can be argued that the relentless action comes at some of the expense of characterisation and worldbuilding we saw in earlier seasons. That said, the story itself is gripping, with Jerry Doyle in particular delivering standout work showing how far he's come since the first season, and every character gets their moment in the sun as the crew of B5 finally decisively strike back against the chaos of the last three years. Special mention must go to Worthram Krimmer as the Centauri Emperor Cartagia, one of the most memorable characters to appear in the show, whilst Walter Koenig does some sterling work later in the season.

One sad loss between seasons is the dropping of Foundation Imaging as the providers of CGI on the show. The replacement effects are adequate, but are nowhere near the quality of Foundation in terms of imaginative ship design or the use of real-world physics, which is a shame.

By the time Season 4 ends, the feeling is that the story is over. The Shadow and Earth Civil War storylines are resolved, if rather messily and not fully, and there is the distinct feeling that there isn't much more to say. As it happened, the show was rescued from cancellation by the TNT Network and a fifth season was commissioned, which proved to be a controversial decision among fans.

Season 4 of Babylon 5 (****) is fast-moving and provides generally impressive and decent resolutions to a lot of the show's long-running storylines. However, the series has to sacrifice some its pacing and more subtle elements in the rush to cram the story into as few episodes as possible, which leads to some problems.",1223596800,,3906,4.815201192250373

No, I want to praise the collection itself.  The CDs in each set are beautiful.  Each set is color coded to the box it comes in.  Each season comes in 6 disks, all clearly numbered and illustrated.

The disks themselves play on every DVD player I've ever put them in.  No funny tricks or anything beyond the basic DVD format, and work like a charm in the crappiest of DVD players.

Enormous attention was given to the crafting of the disks: no commercials, production ads, or other time-sensitive garbage.  Even the FBI warning is tacked onto the end of the last episode of each disk.  The disk can be played without a remote.  By default, subtitles are turned off, the title track is played and the disk automatically cues up to a ""play all episodes"" choice; just hit play and enjoy.

But, of course you can delve in, change settings, even skip straight to a specific scene, yadda...

The only down side is the small number of episodes with commentaries or additional info.  I really enjoy getting into the heads of the people who make entertainment, listen to in-jokes, bloopers, etc.  But this series has, usually, 3 episodes a season for which they've elected to create a commentary track, and no more. Sure the final disk has a couple of other extras (making of clips, etc) but very skimpy on the second audio track.

1924734,4,B0000DGBEY,"My favorite season of BABYLON 5 is Season Three, where the war against the shadows dominates.  Season Four focuses more on the war to unseat President Bush . . . uh, I mean Clark, who has made a mockery of civil liberties, engaged in a propagandistic war of redefining such concepts of loyalty and treachery, and pretty much brought about the kind of world that many believe our current president probably fantasizes about.  Indeed, B5 boards are full of threads about the prescience of B5 in not only reading the nature of the far right in the US in the nineties, but anticipating the nature of their ascendance to power in the first decade of the new century.  From its very beginning B5 was an intensely political show.  If it was slightly less topical than BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, it nonetheless was far more specifically critical of trends in American politics.  If BSG's main purpose is to make the current political situation less black and white but considerably grayer, B5 is out to condemn certain trends in our political situation.  I will hasten to add, however, that apart from President Clark, who is an almost pure embodiment of the fondest hopes and desires of many in the far right of today  (if you read the writings of many of the Dominionists, who have had considerable influence on many leaders in the GOP -- including James Dobson, Mike Huckabee, and Pat Robertson -- they insist on using the power of government to enforce ideological agreement).

For a number of reasons, however, I didn't find Season Four as compelling as Season Three.  A good deal of that lies in arc that involves Garibaldi becoming a sleeper agent for the Psy Corps.  At no point did this seem quite right.  Nonetheless, overall this is a very fascinating season.  Looking at BABYLON 5 as a whole, I have a number of beefs with it.  I detest the look of the aliens, especially Londo's utterly ludicrous hairstyle, which is only slightly more appalling than his accent.  If I eventually got used to it, I never came to like either Londo's look or voice.  Nor, really, the look of any of the aliens on the show.  I also had trouble imagining a human falling in love with a half-alien with a gigantic bony protuberance encircling her head.  But the show also did a number of things that I very much liked.  Let me enumerate those.

First, B5 is not afraid to shake things up.  Although I am suspicious of the claim that creator J. Michael Straczynski had all five seasons meticulously planned out as many claim (if he had, the series would have peaked in Season Five, not Season Three, nor would the final two seasons be somewhat anticlimactic to the Third), there definitely is a lot of forethought put into the stories that Straczynski wants to tell.  The best was the Shadow War, but there were also thrown out there the story of a totalitarian right-wing Earth president and the problem of what to do with the telepaths.  All these elements were put out there in Season One and gradually resolved in the subsequent four seasons.  But along the way Straczynski showed a willingness to shake up the cast.  There are very few characters who started off in the TV movie that began B5 who are there at the very end.  Even some major characters are either gained or lost along the way, trading Sheridan for Sinclair after Season Two, keeping Marcus Cole for only two seasons, and loving Ivanova after the fourth.  I like shows that show no fear in changing everything around from time to time.  More shows need to try this.

So, all in all, another good season for B5.  In fact, Seasons 3 and 4 combined are easily the highpoint of the series.  Season 5 would be a bit of a let down both in terms of story and in cast, as many characters either leave entirely or play a more subdued role.",1203984000,,3777,4.594029850746269

1924742,5,B0000DGBEY,"A friend of mine put it well, Babylon 5 was like a book.  The first was the setup, second the entry of the primary villain, the third the filler (not in a bad way), the 4th the climax, and the 5th the epilogue.  The end to the Shadow War was a little lame as was the human war, but still, this is some grade A television.  I own seasons 2-4 and there are only a few lame episodes in out of the 66.  It's really a great series.

This season is the culmination of a 4 season build up to a massive war against the forces of evil, the Shadows.  This group of aliens hibernates for a millennium before spreading out across the galaxy and causing destruction and chaos.  There theory is that a trial by fire will improve the other races of the galaxy.  The Vorlons, their counterparts believe more in traditional guiding of other races, though aren't above tampering with their DNA.  Despite this epic struggle, the season ultimately boils down to the people of Babylon 5 freeing earth from the evil that has taken hold there, because of the Shadows.

What was so disappointing was that the final battle was all punches being pulled.  It wasn't a major military battle, ship vs ship.  The leader decides not to make it look like an alien invasion, so he gives up most of his ships and only uses human ones.  To even this out and avoid the uncomfortable killing people thing, the authors wuss out and give the Bab 5 people a secret weapon that just disables many of the Earth ships.  Then the actual battle ends up being vs automated defense platforms.  It was just a real let down after all that buildup.

Still, despite it's issues, this is a really good season and a really good series overall.  You could do a lot worse looking for good scifi.",1187654400,,1740,4.370716510903427

1924747,5,B0000DGBEY,"Babylon 5 Season VI continues to shed light on the ongoing adventures and parallel stories of prominent people aboard a major space station under Human control in neutral territory orbiting Epsilon 3.

The date is 2261 and representatives from both the major and minor space-faring races have all gathered at Babylon 5 in a last effort at achieving victory during the most deadly conflict the universe has seen to date... the Shadow War!

Bruce Boxleitner, Mira Furlan, Andreas Katsulas, Peter Jurasik, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.

The only setbacks are in relation to:

1) Enough with the writer's, J. Michael Straczynski's, obsession with the Germans, the Soviets and WWII; it gets tiring after the first THREE seasons!  JMS, as he himself states in The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5 website, has a lot of (too much) personal issues/baggage going back to the WWII era: ""I have had a longstanding interest and familiarity with this area...and through my European roots with relatives who were in Germany and Poland when the camps were in full swing, and later when the Russian government beat down its people. I have plenty of personal background on this one.""

JMS would do well to keep all these personal issues... personal (!) and to himself.  This is an outstanding sci-fi show that should not become the instrument or the means for anyone's personal agenda and not-so-hidden messages.

2) In the episode ""The Exercise of Vital Powers,"" JMS trash talks Greeks through Garibaldi by stating that happiness for a Greek consists of ""3 goats and some wine.""

I wonder though, why JMS doesn't make similar ""witty"" jokes about Ivanovas' faith... Hmmm... He is a self-professed atheist, but is he though?  I wonder...

3) What has happened to Vir?  He is so much thinner, hyper and so much less adorable now...

On the positive side:

1) The OUTSTANDING plot and subplots keep getting better and better!

2) The GREAT characters become more and more developed, and

3) The wonderful feeling of being addicted to the show and wanting more!

4) The music has gotten even better in this season.

1924750,3,B0000DGBEY,"I just wanted to comment briefly on the video quality of this set. I just bought a new HDTV and was looking forward to watching this series filling that nice large screen in a proper 16:9 aspect ratio. As everyone probably knows, all the DVDs in this series suffer from some quality issues due to the way the CGI shots were originally done. This was noticeable in previous season releases as well as this one. So I was prepared for this when I popped the first disc in. But I wasn't prepared for the extreme amounts of grain in the video. When watching this on my old 32"" Trinitron TV, the video looked fine. But on my new 46"" HDTV, it looks really, really awful. All the flaws are laid bare on a large HDTV screen. At first, I thought it was an issue with my TV. But all my other DVDs look fantastic. So I tweaked the settings as much as I could, but it didn't really help much. Then for comparison purposes, I popped in a disc from Season 1. There is some noticeable grain there, too, but it's still quite watchable and it even gives it a nice film-like quality which is kind of pleasing. I also tried the movie ""A Call to Arms"" from the Babylon 5 movie collection set. It looks pretty good, too. But on the Season 4 set, and on ""Thirdspace"" from the movie set, the grain is seriously distracting and looks just plain bad. It has unfortunately ruined my enjoyment of this very good season. From what I've read, this seems to be a problem with the source and not with the DVD transfers themselves, so I don't know if this will ever be correctable. And like I said, it looks fine on a regular TV. But I just wanted to give a warning to anyone who plans to watch this on an HDTV someday.

1924759,5,B0000DGBEY,"During this season we see the wrapping up the shadow wars. Captain Sheridan returns from the dead to lead the opponents of the darkness into battle. The Vorlons show their true colors, the Shadows and their role are understood and the last of the first ones travel beyond the rim, once and for all.

With the end of the shadow Wars the focus is brought to the legacy the Shadows have left behind: the darkness remaining on Earth and the other worlds allied with the dark ones. In this season we see our heroes mostly dealing with liberating Earth from the evil clutches of President Clark, the Psycore and their allies. Lots of great episodes right until the end of the seasons that ends with the superb episode ""Deconstruction of Falling Stars"". In this episode, we see the story of B5 and the aftereffects of the actions of our heroes as a part of the recorded history one million years removed from our story. This is a great conclusion to the season, wanting to show how the work of few people can really effect long lasting change. JMS, the writer and creator of B5 is very hot on the personal responsibility of individuals in creating change for the many i.e. we should never feel that it is a waste of time to act even alone, to create collective change, as the actions of the few people of integrity can create lasting for all. This episode is almost a manifesto for his beliefs in this regard, as well as showing how history is fickle in its representations of events, depending on who is in charge at the time. Lots of wisdom in this last episode, that is also very moving in its very final scenes.

Lots going on in this season, mostly because it seemed as if the funding for B5 was going to be cut, making this the last season. But at the last minute a venue for the last season for B5 was found, making Season 5 possible. By then however some o the actors had found other work, so this is for example the last time we get to see Ivanova...So enjoy her in this season, as she will be gone in Season 5. Generally speaking, this is the last majestic season of B5 and probably its most natural conclusion. A great, great show.",1150588800,,2135,4.388888888888889
1924760,4,B0000DGBEY,"This is the year that Babylon 5 ended. And then ended again. And then again. And then was picked up to end again a year later.

The Great Maker, JMS, wrote to save the day, fearing that his show wouldn't make it one more year, and wrapped up everything he could in his grand five-year plan in this fourth season.  The series suffers for it, overcompacted as that made it, but also soars in some places.

The Shadow War plays out in the first six episodes. That ends and you really sense ""the show is done... they don't have to say much more after this, do they?"" at the end of the sixth episode, Into the Fire.  But, lo and behold, there's more dragged back in on that in ep. 7, Epiphanies... And ep. 9, Atonement, is a lovely look back to the past after that... But a series so strong and running at such a pace shouldn't let itself run on fumes - see the godawful ep. 8, The Illusion of Truth.

Then, the Minbari have a war and Earth has a war and the series ends with a new finale - all things resolved and brilliant - the whole world nearly at peace - in Rising Star. Ahh.

Then, for some reason, the series has an epilogue of variable short stories tacked on.  A coda of occasional genius (see the brothers preserving the Rangers segment) and downright stabbing pains to the senses (the faux talk show segments), ep. 22, The Deconstruction of Falling Stars, ends the series on a sublime note as humanity finally leaves the sun behind and transcends this plane of existence. Neat, that.

Wham, there's more.  The fifth season remains to establish the Fall of Centauri Prime and the final destinies of the lead characters, the station, and the potential for the aborted spin-off series Crusade.  It's really a bit like ""this year gets the plot and that year gets the characters..."" only, it's not quite that way at all. This year has Marcus and Ivanova - that's a major advantage. And the fifth year does have some plot... some.

But this climax season is surely still nearly just about all it needs to be to end the series. What comes to Lyta, Londo, G'Kar, Vir, and Sheridan is all fairly expected in year five.  What we get here is the completion of much of the really suspenseful part of the series.  At least two thirds of the glorious plot arcs are consummated. Wham.

The 4th Season - ""No Surrender, No Retreat"" - the Climax. The first third averages 8 out of 10, the second third averages 6.5 out of 10, and the final third averages 8.5 out of 10.

Enjoy Mars. Enjoy G'Kar and Londo, of course. Enjoy three, count 'em, three (!) giant, meaningful ideological wars and their resolutions.  Enjoy, finally, the tying-up (or, at least, addressing well) of just about every plot thread that you can think of from Day One of the series. Enjoy the best episodes of the series, the one-two-three punch of Exercise of Vital Powers, The Face of the Enemy, and Intersections in Real Time, a very bleak, very, very brilliant stretch of television there.

Enjoy the tearful tragedy and the so sweet rejoicing of these endings. Cherish your B5 collection.",1138320000,2,3052,4.490054249547921
1924761,5,B0000DGBEY,"Nominated for 6 Emmys and 3 Hugo Awards in its five-season run, Babylon 5 changed the landscape of the TV science fiction series genre. Following on the heels of hit series such as Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5 is unrivaled by any of its peers in its application of special effects. The brainchild of J. Michael Straczynski (writer for such shows as Murder She Wrote and Walker, Texas Ranger), the hour-long sci-fi drama series breaks new ground by deploying a five-season storyline that follows the outline of a traditional novel. As such, Babylon 5 is more like a mini-series that lasts five years instead of the usual three to five nights. And also unlike its predecessors, the series showcases original advanced technologies, believable alien characters (who speak alien and not English), and boasts of superb costume and makeup. Premiering in mid-season 1994, Babylon 5 established a solid audience and continues to inspire new generations of fans via syndicated reruns on cable...

Babylon 5 follows the daily events that transpire on Babylon 5, a five-mile long space station from the year 2258. Built by the Earth Alliance, Babylon 5 orbits a lone planet in interplanetary (neutral) space. The setting for an Earthling military post and a transportation hub for businessmen and general travelers, the space station's primary purpose is to provide a safe haven for the airing of differences between the alien races. Similar in function to the United Nations, Babylon 5 is tasked with preserving the peace between the five primary space-traveling civilizations - the Earth Alliance, the Mimbari Federation, the Centauri Republic, the Narn Regime, and the Vorlon Empire. Headed by Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (Michael O'Hare), and later by Capt. John J. Sheridan (Bruce Boxleitner), Babylon 5 is home to almost 300,000 humans and their alien counterparts. With so many confined to such a small area, the space station is ripe for internal struggle, racial conflict, regular cast members' personal problems, and showdowns between various political interests. It's this intricate and diverse storyboard, coupled with amazing visual effects, that makes Babylon 5 one of the most successful sci-fi TV shows in recent memory...

The Babylon 5 (Season 4) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""The Hour of the Wolf"" in which Capt. Sheridan and Garibaldi are both missing and presumed dead in the aftermath of the Z'ha'dum explosion. Meanwhile, Londo has taken on a new job as a security advisor to the emperor of the Centauri Republic... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Illusion of Truth"" in which a pack of ISN reporters arrives on Babylon 5, incurring Capt. Sheridan's wrath and later his blessing, and ""The Face of the Enemy"" in which Garibaldi betrays the trust of his former commander, Capt. Sheridan, setting a trap for him and using Sheridan's father as the bait...

1924762,5,B0000DGBEY,"Tyler C. Powell got it straight on when he discussed B5's use of it influence, it's a great write up, and he gets to the point better than I ever could (although I can't figure out why he thinks Buffy the vampire Slayer is the greatest TV show ever, but oh well no ones perfect!!!)

In my opinion B5 S4 is the best season from B5, it wraps up The Shadow war, and then goes on too the war to liberate Earth (or so it seems) alot of things happen fast, and the season is non stop actually I can't even remember a filler episode, it's that good!!!!

It's important to note that series was at this fast pace because the makers thought that WB's were going to pull the plug after season 4 (which they wisely didn't) and though the best of the best, it does affect the overall quality of the fifth season!!!

Some notes I made:

1. Everyone has a purpose- B5 took the unpresedented step in making both The Vorlons and Shadows as bad as each other, I can't remember a Sci-fi or any sci-fi TV show ever doing this!!!

2. The Sheridan interrigation episode. Obviously influenced by the Cardassian interigation of Picard from STTNG, this though is even more vicious, definitely not for the soft hearted!!!

3. Delenn & Sheridan- Has there ever been a greater Sci-fi couple!!!!!

4. Garabaldi- just brilliant his change in behaviour and betrayal of Sheridan, it was shocking, yet brilliant!!!

5. Bester- He is a bad man after all

6. Minbari civil war- Even the purist aren't perfect

7. G'Kar & Londo- Suprise, suprise, brilliant again, is it me or are they starting to like each other (no it can't be...)

8. Ivoniva & Marcus- Perhaps the most tragic thing ever!!!!

9. Lennier & Vir- The greatest second cast characters ever!!!!!

10. This is a brilliant show, need I say more!!!!",1122163200,,1773,4.485981308411215
1924763,4,B0000DGBEY,"Season 4 continues the quality of the previous two seasons. If you're new to Babylon 5, start with the first season (or, rather, the first movie). Now then, a topic I'm interested in: the originality, or lack there of, of Babylon 5.

It's an interesting question--Does unoriginality make something inherently worse?

The plotlines of Babylon 5 are not original. They are taken from other, sometimes famous, sources. But the show does not try to hide this, either. The war against the shadows is straight out of Tolkien, repleat with the shadows coming back every so often and the passing of the elder races to the Gray Havens, er, I mean, beyond the rim of the galaxy. The Menbari are clearly elves.

Earth's development into a dictatorship follows Nazi progression (especially with Nightwatch) and other, similar historical sources, with a nod or two to Orwell. For instance, in the second season they speak of the development of the Ministry of Peace, which they call MiniPax, and the Ministry of Truth--straight out of 1984. The decadance of the Centauri court seems Imperial Roman, and Cartagia a veritable Caligula (is the similarity in their names coincidental?). Garibaldi's betrayal of the messianic figure of Sheridan is certainly a re-enactment of Judas Iscariot, and specifically as represented in Jesus Christ Superstar where Judas explains that Christ has started to believe his own press, and that the man has become more important than the mission. Bester's frequent farewell of ""be seeing you"" evokes The Prisoner, and again, I doubt that this is coincidental given everything else.

So, does any of this matter? Does it take away from the power of Babylon 5, that its central storylines are culled directly from other sources? I don't believe that it does take anything away. Instead, it makes Babylon 5 an interesting pastiche of many of the themes and stories that interest us against a sci-fi backdrop. And it's certainly a clever idea, regardless of whether we approve or not. Further, the characters are individual enough that, despite the similarity of plot, the stories are always unique. There has never been G'Kar in any other work, if you understand my meaning.

In conclusion, Babylon 5 is not weakened by its use of earlier stories and is, in some ways, strengthened by it. It fortunately does not try to hide its relationship to the sources on which it draws, making explicit references to items such as the thirty pieces of silver and the night of the long knives. And so, Babylon 5 (itself a reference no doubt to the Tower of Babel, man reaching out onto the heavens, approaching God) represents humanity and all our stories come together. Can't be done all the time, but, done once, it's pretty neat.",1114992000,6,2734,4.947712418300654
1924764,5,B0000DGBEY,"Season 4 on B5 is when it all comes apart and gets back together again for the characters and plot lines on this fabulous show.

It's a shame it's not still on the Sci-Fi Channel or TNT because even rewatching the show again and again is a pleasure.  Luckily, we have the DVD sets so all us ""B5'ers"" can continue to enjoy the experience.  I have no complaints about disc quality, not being a techie with a state-of-the-art video/audio system.  The dvd's play nicely on my little cobbled-together group of boxes, and besides, I'm so absorbed in the shows I rarely notice glitches!

The only other ""space opera"" that followed such a closely planned arc of stories was ""Deep Space Nine"", which is for my money superior to B5 in sets, acting, and special effects---the Star Trek bunch just had more money!  However, for pure entertainment with some excellent actors (who became better over the 5 years), it would be hard to beat Babylon 5.  The 4th season is a wild ride on the wild side of science fiction television, and I highly recommend it to all its fans---present and future.",1104710400,3,1078,4.612565445026178
1924765,4,B0000DGBEY,"This is one of the best seasons of B5.

It showed to end of the shadow wars, the resoltion of the earth conflict. This is a show that I would skip out on my friends, miss family meeting, pretty much drop everything I was doing for fear of my VCR failing and missing a show.  (More of a threat is the way the cahnnel in San Anonio shamelessly kept changing the start times without ever mentioning it.)

This is what SciFI should be.  In fact it is so good that it retractivly destroy TNG in my mind and set up at lot of different show (even outside the scifi scope) with high standards to reach.

Continuity is not something that was important to me before this show but it is now something I expect for any good quality show.

This is one of the few SciFi shows that doesn't abuse the fact that it is SciFi to get its characters out of a jam or to force them to act in a way against their character.

My only complaints is that the end felt rushed (not B5's fault since at the time they did not know that TNT would be picking up the series.) and I did not really like the way the shadow war ended - but that shadow war ending made perfect sense that is just a personal dislike of mine.

All-in-all another successful season.",1104624000,2,1224,4.135021097046414
1924766,4,B0000DGBEY,"I started watching this series beginning with season 2(by recommendation from many reviewers here) and by season 3(the best in the series, by far) I was thoroughly hooked to buy this, season 4.  With the Shadow War in full swing throughout season 3 there was bound to be a let-down in the following season.  The Shadow War overflows into season 4 and the final battle is a magnificent climax with stellar(excuse the pun) special effects but with a fairly lame resolution.  There are 22 episodes here and with nearly twenty episodes to go after the climax the next phase in the story unfolds: that of reclaiming Earth from President Clark and his Orwellian empire.  There are a few average shows leading up to the confrontation, with side-stories covering specific characters and their agendas, but when all the pieces are in place(a Queen's Gambit, to be sure) the fireworks begin and the show has renewed vigor and purpose.  I have a minor complaint regarding the dialogue.  For the most part the teleplays are sharp and seldom strained, but occasionally there is a feeble jab at humor regarding love-making or something else with similar predictability that felt forced.  There is also frequent use of modern-day slang, which I'm certain will not be as hip in the middle of the 23rd century as it was in the mid-nineties when this show was created.  Someday the dialogue in this show will definitely show its age. Then there is the occasional flashback to season 1 which was horribly written with tepid performances from some characters that make a return here; and seriously speaking, I can see why they were either replaced or their lines were cut to shorten their fairly unremarkable performances.  This series ends with a complete wrap-up of all the characters and an all-encompassing final show that had me scratching my head in lieu of the fact that there is yet another season left to be seen.

I too had a few occasions where the picture would break up and even freeze as someone else has mentioned.
I removed the dvd from the player and cleaned it useing a cd/dvd spray cleaner. When I reinserted the dvd and played it again I had no further problems.
I have encountered this on one or two other brand new dvds of other shows and in each instance a good cleaning solved the problem.
The discs never look dirty or scratched and are always played fresh out of the case which leads me to believe it may be a coating of something that cant be seen by the naked eye but is detectable by the players laser.
It may not solve everyones problem but its worth trying before returning the discs for an exchange and then encountering the same problem.

Yes, Babylon 5 is the best sci-fi show ever produced, and season 3 and 4 are the best of the best.  After a rather boring first season, J.Michael Straczynski (series creator) took the reins and wrote 100% of season 4.  AND IT SHOWS.  In a mere 22 episodes the following events happen: End of the Shadow War.  Minbari Civil War.  Earth Civil War.  Mars Independence.  And the Birth of the Interstellar Alliance (like Trek's Federation-a galactic government).  Season 4 in my opinion is the best season...of any show...ever.  (NOTE:IF YOU'RE NEW TO BABYLON 5 I recommend you start with season 2... which is where the show truly starts to shine.)",1079136000,4,688,4.754237288135593

1924773,5,B0000DGBEY,"The fourth season of Babylon 5 is titled ""No Surrender, No Retreat"" and boy o boy does it meet that title head on wear it proudly.  Simply put, this fourth chapter in the five chapters (seasons) that ingenious creator J.M. Straczynski wrote entirely on his own is one of the most incredible and entertaining seasons of television ever produced.  From the very beginning of the series J.M. Straczynski had been tailoring this extraordinary space ""opera"" to an ultimate conclusion through a multiple faceted series of plots, sub plots, twists and turns and all of that is paid off in immeasurable quality through this fourth season which is a collection heartrending, enlightening and ultimately supremely satisfying episodes that are, to say the least, unforgettable.
This wide sweeping season imparts a great many details that are incredible in the breadth and scope of the entire series.  In past reviews for Babylon 5, I've highlight episodes that stood out among the rest.  In the case of this fourth season, I find that to be impossible as every single episode of the season is incredible; so, what follows is a synopsis of the season which I hope gives everyone a good idea of how the season goes without breaking it down into to much detail.
The fourth season:
At the conclusion of the third season, Sheridan had ""sacrificed"" himself in the hopes of destroying the Shadows at Z'Ha'Dum.  The fourth season leads in with Sheridan still missing which also leads into a search for Mr. Garibaldi who went missing at about the same time as Sheridan.
This incredible fourth season coalesces into several universe shattering events such as; Sheridan's return from Z'Ha'Dum despite no one ever doing so before and he's brought with him ""a"" First One in Lorien; G'Kar leaves B5 to search for Mr. Garibaldi as he is his only non Narn friend which leads him to a doom ""and"" enlightenment he could never have imagined; Sheridan and Delenn organizes the League Worlds into an alliance against the Shadows; Garibaldi returns but he is not quite who he used to be; Mollari determines that Emperor Cartagia must go before Centauri Prime is wiped out as the Vorlons begin eradicating any planet that is under Shadow influence; Sheridan finds he must remove the Vorlon ambassador from B5.  The Shadow War comes to an extremely exciting battle involving Sheridan's forces which includes the League Worlds, the White Star fleet and several of the First Ones against both the Vorlons and the Shadows all ending in a somewhat melodramatic but highly intriguing conclusion to the Shadow War...  Beyond the wonderfully scripted Shadow War in this first part of the season there are the wonderfully crafted scenes in which Mollari goes to Centauri Prime and removes Emperor Cartagia, resulting in a great surprise for him but one in which he had previously envisioned.
With the Shadow War now concluded, Sheridan now begins to look at the untenable situation at home with President Clark; Delenn is called home as her relationship with Sheridan is in question and in doing so she discovers a truth about Minbari racial purity that is quite telling; Garibaldi involves himself in a scheme to remove Sheridan; Franklin and  Marcus embark on a plan to assist the Mars Resistance; due to the Grey Council having been disbanded by Delenn during the Shadow War a civil war breaks out on Minbar between the religious and warrior castes resulting in an amazing scene on Minbar between Delenn and Neroon.
Sheridan, no longer able to stand by and watch President Clark kill innocent civilians launches his fleet towards Earth via Proxima 3 and Mars, hoping to free those worlds of the Earth Force fleets blockading them; Garibaldi expends the ultimate betrayal upon Sheridan only to find that he wasn't exactly in his right mind in doing so; Sheridan must endure torture at the hands of Earth Force interrogators; Ivanova leads an incredible battle against Earth Force ships enhanced with Shadow technology which results in the ultimate sacrifice of two characters down the road; Garibaldi, now free of the influence he was under, leads a mission to free Sheridan.
In one of the most incredible hours of episodic television ever created, ""Endgame"" brings the entire series to the ultimate moment of decisions as Sheridan's forces free Mars and head for Earth to remove President Clark.  Few series has ever created such a dramatic episode through years of setup such as this one; this episode is a true treat for the fans!  What follows in ""Rising Star"" is fairly incredible as well as Sheridan is forced to resign but he and Delenn made plans for that eventuality as well.
I highly recommend not only this incredible fourth season of Babylon 5 but the preceding three and the fifth season to any and all fans of great Science Fiction that includes extraordinary writing, acting and visual eye candy.  Simply put, this is an incredible and extraordinary season and series!  {ssintrepid}

1924774,4,B0000DGBEY,"Well, it's time for the final showdown between the Vorlons, Shawdows -- and everybody else. When I saw the fourth season on television for the first time, I felt that the story arc regarding the intergalactic armageddon was a bit of a let down. I was expecting the Vorlons and Shadows to go down in a blaze of hatred for each other, that they couldn't get past their mind sets about how the younger races of the galaxy should evolve. In addition, I expected to see that the other races, led by Sheridan and D'Lenn, would come to appreciate that the same thing would happen to them when the Vorlons and Shadows wiped each other out. This would be the basis for their peaceful co-existence, I felt. Finally, while I appreciated the second story arc in which Sheridan brings President Clark down, that story arc also felt anti-climactic -- you knew what was going to happen.
However, my views definitely changed once I saw the context in which JMS was working with for the fourth season. It was definitely wiser to make Sheridan and D'Lenn offer a ""crucible"" to bring out the truth, that the Vorlons and Shadows wanted the younger races to choose which side was ""correct"" in its method of ""helping"" them to evolve. Lorien's role as a father figure also helps to make all the parties realize that war and conflict are in nobody's interest. Seeing him fly off with the Vorlons and Shadows at the end of ""Into the Fire"" gives this element of the Babylon 5 storyline a proper sense of finality.
It also made sense to have Sheridan's conflict with President Clark end in the way it did. Clark is a tyrant who has to be stopped -- even if that means a civil war. Sheridan is a reluctant hero. He doesn't want to use military force that could result in the deaths of fellow officers and soldiers, not to mention the deaths of civilians. But he knows what he must do -- make sacrifices and accept the consequences for his actions. He has to do this so that humans don't have to live under a tyrant, and to be able to live in peace and prosperity with the other races. In essence, Sheridan is sacrificing himself for the sins of others, and this makes him an even more compelling character in season four.
That said, the fourth season of Babylon 5 on DVD is the best yet, although I feel there are some minor flaws with the content. First of all, I think JMS's first commentary track should have been about ""Into the Fire,"" and not ""Following Toward Apotheosis."" It would have been more interesting to hear his thoughts about how the final battle between the Vorlons, Shadows and other races should have unfolded, versus what he might have originally envisioned for it.
However, I did enjoy his commentary about ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars."" It was surprising to hear that there were only going to be four seasons of B5, and that this episode had to be put in place of ""Sleeping in Light,"" which was the final episode of Season 5, and of the whole series. Nonetheless, I enjoyed ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"" because of its documentary feel and that the human race would one day evolve to the level of the Vorlons.
I think one of the other good episodes in Season 4 was ""The Illusion of Truth."" I don't think Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minster, could have done a better job of trashing Sheridan's reputation.
I also enjoyed the story arc about D'Lenn being forced to bring the Grey Council back together for the survival of her people. I also liked her twist -- having more Worker Caste members on the council than either the Warrior or Religious Castes. ""They do not wish to conquer or convert -- only to build the future. War and religion must work in the service of the people, not the other way around."" This is as liberal-democratic as you can get, as far as I'm concerned.
The other supplemental materials JMS provided for the fourth season DVD package of B5 are pretty much standard fare. I don't know if this is good or bad, but the supplemental materials in the other DVD packages are very similar to those found in the fourth season.
However, if there is thing that really stands out in the fourth season DVD package, it's the audio. If you have a surround sound system, you will come to appreciate the Dolby 5.1 audio found with this package. The explosions, the engines' humming and screaming, and other sound elements really come through in my speakers. There are hints of the Dolby 5.1 audio in the other DVD sets, but they don't come close to the fourth season.
All in all, the fourth season of Babylon 5 on DVD is worth every penny! While I feel that the third season of B5 is the best of all the seasons, the fourth season is comparable for the way it resolves many of the story threads that were weaved in the first three seasons.",1078531200,3,4763,4.526682134570765
1924775,5,B0000DGBEY,"Babylon 5 is unusual for american television and television in general because it is great science fiction. You are presented with characters you can like, characters you can hate, and characters that will disappoint you. The characters are not one dimensional, and the show keeps you rivetted all the way through. Most shows have a kind of villian of the week mentality, and what happened the week before has little relevance to what happens this week. Babylon 5 doesn't, and in fact there are things characters do in season one that don't make sense till season 3 and beyond.
At the start of the season after the ""cliffhanger""(Oh, I know this is a terrible pun) ending of season 3 we watch as the characters have try to figure out what to do next. Sheridan is most likely dead on Z'ha'dum, and Garabaldi has disappeared. The Shadows have paused as they try to recover from the large hole the whitestar made in there homeworld as it made its final attack with two powerful nuclear devices. Londo is on Centauri Prime and has one of his nightmares confirmed as the Emperor gives the shadows a small island to use as a base. G'kar has decided to go looking for Garabaldi. From here everything starts getting worse as the Shadows and Vorlons begin using massive planet killers to destroy anyone supporting the other. The Alliance Sheridan struggled to put together is falling apart, G'kar is captured by the Centauri, and when they find Garabaldi he is not the same.
Then when all seems darkest Sheridan returns with one of the best lines ever. (Drazi Ambassador) ""Captain...we thought you were dead."" (Capt. Sheridan)""I was. I'm better now.""
Sheridan revitalizes the alliance and gathers together the largest fleet the younger races have ever put together, and prepares to launch a last desperate battle against the Vorlons and Shadows. Meanwhile Londo strikes a deal with G'kar that if he helps Londo get rid of the Emperor, Londo with free the Narn. The stage is set for one of the most climatic two episodes of the entire series, and of television as the fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of Londo/G'kar and John Sheridan.
And like all great heroes they accomplish their victories, but at a terrible price. John's attack on Z'ha'dum has left him with only twenty years left to live, and G'kar has lost an eye. This is only the begin of this great season which by then end will give up a Minbari civil war, and a human civil war. We will learn what has happened to Garabaldi, and find new reasons to hate Alfred Bester.
Then in the final episode of the season we are treated to with the exception of Joss Whedon's dream episode in season four of Buffy, the most original episode of any American Scifi show. An episode that gives us a look at the future of humanity, and how our characters actions will live through time. This is the best season of Babylon 5 as all the characters are stretched, and must pay a price for each victory they achieve. Heroes are boring if they win without some sacrifice and not just a physical one. Emotionally this is the most powerful of the five seasons.",1078185600,,3092,4.644160583941606
1924776,5,B0000DGBEY,"I too was no big fan of season one, after a couple of episodes when it debuted, I tuned out; it was too derivative of Star Trek and Straczynski had yet to find B5's unique and astounding voice.
Season Four is a stunner, bringing two wars to conclusion, raising heros from the dead, a wicked conclusion to Bester's most fiendish plot (in his defense, he was fighting for his freedom and his life).  As always, ""The Demolished Man"" joke is a great one--and if you don't get it, you need to learn a LOT more about sf!
Once again, the writing is amazing, the direction tight, the CG splendid--the explosions finally stop looking like bad video games from 1985--and the acting, well, the ""torture"" ep--that's all I'll say--should have one a certain actor an Emmy.  But...we know he didn't.  I'm afraid the same fate awaits Peter Jackson, et al, on Feb 29th.
This season also contains my fav ep of all time, ""Deconstruction of Falling Stars.""  Another ep that deserved an Emmy.  I can't say enough in it's praise. B5 can no longer be labelled at ST's ... little brother: it's an equal in every sense.
The cast commentary is hilarious.  You can tell that these are people (Boxleitner, Christian, Tallman, etc) who genuinely like each other and the camraderie and friendship is still there, six years after it all ended.  Straz's three ep commentaries are interesting, but I wish that one of the actors or ep directors could have been present to discuss the eps; Staz's voice, contrary to his pen, can be monotone and a little somnolent, but, once fully awake, what he says IS interesting.
This review of the serious still says everything that I feel needs to be said.  It goes straight to the heart of the B5 series and the real core.
Eh, voila...
J. Michael Straczynski and Robert B. Parker (of Spenser fame) have both achieved the same thing with very different subject matters and in very different media: they have made the moral choices of their characters the primary, indeed, almost the SOLE focus of the action. Straczynski's task is probably that much the harder because, unlike the novel, he can only graphically illustrate his characters' inner worlds. The result is triumph; presenting something so rare on TV: real people.
Yes, as in the Parker novels, there is plenty of violence. Also there is no downplaying certain characters' relish of the test of battle and their love of soldiering. Straczynski has a real respect for the military and does not let his correct skepticism of government (even if does repeat the McCarthy myth on a commentary track) spill over into disrespect for those who put their bodies where ""the metal hit the meat."" His use spectacular special effects only enhances.
The ground breaking CG had one real drawback: B-5 explosions simply don't look real. I guess they just didn't have the processor power to simulate them on their budget. Even now fire is said to be impossible to model and thus its creation is more the work of artist than artisan-something the insane schedule of network drama simply doesn't allow.
Both series place characters--whatever the literary allusion--in situation where they have choose between expedience and principle. Straczynski does a superb job of dropping his characters--ones obviously very beloved to him--into horrible situation in which they die or undergo the most dreadful pain and loss. Then there are those, like Mr. Morden, Mr. Bester nice ""Demolish Man"" joke), and ""President"" Clark who clearly took the road of expedience. Straczynski shows, graphically, the very real consequences of their actions not only for themselves but for billions of other humans and aliens.
The main theme was taken from an old Poul Anderson novel whose name eludes me. He pictured a war between vastly powerful species whose mere existence was outside human comprehension but who used humans and others as proxies in their never ending struggle. Redux the Shadows and Vorlons--who turn out to be as amoral as the Shadows when crossed.
As with the Spenser novels, Babylon 5 rises far above genre to achieve what is so utterly rare in any historical era: art. They both show us the recesses of the heart, the secret places we hide from everyone else. We are also shown the devastating consequences of moral failure or necessity. In a hundred years B-5 will still resonate in a way my beloved Star Trek never can. Star Trek, you see, is fantasy, the way the world ought to be. Babylon 5, unfortunately, is the way the future WILL be.",1077062400,10,4486,4.839634941329857
1924777,3,B0000DGBEY,"I gave B5 Season One zero-stars because it is horrible, and for some reason watched season II hoping for a little entertainment (to no avail) but there is a dedicated fan following, so I tried again with the 4'th and got a little entertainment.

The show is still peppered with a few bad actors that make you cringe when they say their three lines. And there is STILL something terribly wrong with those graphics, yet SOME are really good. It's so puzzling, and weird that they would spend so much on set-design and then have that horrible CGI mixed in. Almost everything did improve on my scale (writing, acting, money-shots, etc.) but it's hard to see this show ever being more three stars.",1075680000,,692,4.626016260162602
1924778,4,B0000DGBEY,"I have waited impatiently for Season Four to be released, now I wish that I'd waited longer for Warner Bros. to improve upon the quality of the transfer. Into the Fire was possibly the worst episode in terms of the inconsistent quality of the shots. Some screens are downright grainy and poorly lit and yet the next can be truly watchable.
For the show, 9/10, for the transfer 4/10. Warner Bros. can and must do better for Season 5.",1075680000,,432,4.481012658227848
1924779,5,B0000DGBEY,"Combining plot elements reminiscent of Tolkien and the Arthurian legends, writing that's rarely been equalled, characters you actually care about, an epic story spanning ages and generations, and still with more believability per frame than most non-SF dramas, B5 is in a class of its own.
Like some others here, I'm replacing my tapes with DVD's as they are released. The ability to quickly visit any scene from any show easily justifies the extra cost.
Season three is where most B5 fans got hooked - I know I did. I watched season one on and off. With season two, I found myself watching more. By the time the story arc began to unfold in season two, I was watching every week. By season three, watching every week's episode had taken on the nature of an almost spiritual imperative. Unlike some here, I don't necessarily consider season four a close second, but pretty much equal to season three.
B5 broke so much new ground, it's hard to list it all. It certainly was one of the first to show bad things happening to good characters. It took the bold step of letting you believe for years that certain characters were good (or bad), when they might turn out to be much more complex in the end. The characters become so real to us that I've seen grown men choke back their emotions when a character you only saw in a robotic suit incapable of expressing emotion get killed. B5 was a pioneer in admitting to and exploring issues of faith even though its creator and writer is an avowed atheist.
Even in its portrayal of relationships, romantic and otherwise, it was unique. Everywhere else on TV, characters were introduced in act 1 and in bed by act 3. As in real life, this also happened on B5, but you also got a chance to savor the growth of relationships you could never hope to see on episodic TV. B5 had its share of great love stories but they were never formulaic. Two were cut short by tragedy, but one of those was never consummated while the other grew from a one-night stand with political motives. You even saw people who were close and had some obvious attraction, but chose for various good reasons not to act on those feelings. Based on perhaps limited experience, these people seem more real and interesting to me than most I see on TV.
At a time when most entertainment teaches few positive values, B5 celebrates commitment to a greater cause. It balances this with cautionary tales that suggest we be constantly vigilant that our cause is really just. It teaches self-sacrifice. Simply watching most episodes of B5 is like a workout for your conscience. It makes you think. The characters themselves think. It taught that victories aren't always won by violence and that the only persistent peace is achieved through conscience, commitment, and determination.",1075334400,17,2782,4.69120654396728
1924780,3,B0000DGBEY,"... for not improving on the quality of the telecine transfers. There are probably more dust specks and garbage on the few episodes I've watched than in all three previous sets combined. And the DVD compression hasn't improved any -- artifacts all over the place, with some live action scenes practically shimmering on my high-end home theater system. (The sound, while not perfect, is acceptable).
Can I say that I love this show so much I'll buy the damn things anyway? Warner Bros. knows this is true for millions of fans. Too bad they're producing these sets as cheaply as possible, with no additional funding for cleaning up the transfers. Recently I witnessed the processing of transferring a network hourlong drama onto DVD, and it was amazing to see the operator clean up video artifacts on the fly -- erasing them just like Photoshop. Sure, it adds to the bottom line, but I think Warner Bros. can handle it. Reportedly they're making so much money off these boxed sets they're gonna OK a new B5 project in 2004, simply because it'll turn a profit off the subsequent DVD sales alone.
Warner Bros., you've got us in the palm of your hand. We're fans of the show and we want more of it. Now that you've got all our dollars, howzabout treating us with a little respect?",1074297600,20,1275,4.646017699115045
1924781,5,B0000DGBEY,"Likely the greatest of the 5 Babylon seasons, season 4 contains a majesty and scope unequaled in pretty much any other television series. Within it there is the fall and rise of empires and the demonstration of just what one person at the right place in history can do.
The quality of this show continued to grow in even this season. The FX shots are of much higher quality, which pays off to no end during the many, many extended battle sequences that take place throughout the entire season. Like the rest of the series prior, these sequences are works of art, with the ships and fighters buzzing around each other in actual combat strategy, not just sitting there and trying to pummel each other. The writing is stellar once, despite Straczynski's penchant for just gobs of dialogue at certain parts, and the quirky humor and one-liners that are dropped in from time to time keep things fresh.
The story, though, is where this season truly shines. All the major arcs that have been building over the previous seasons are resolved, sometimes with unexpected results. The characters all move in new directions, some further into darkness and some come into the light.
While some people accuse this season of being rushed, that is not the fault of the writer, but rather Warner Brothers. JMS simply had to finish as much of the major narration as possible before WB pulled the plug at the end of the season. While this didn't happen, it wasn't known whether it would till the production of the last few episodes.
As for the DVD set, all that was good about them before is back. The JMS commentaries are interesting, especially the one with Michael Vejar as that gives a technical view of how an episode was put together. The cast commentary was good, though there was very oddly a lot of instances of dead air. It seems as though the recorder stopped working at times. Also, Jerry Doyle comes off a bit obnoxious during some of the beginning. Still, very worth a listen. The data files are small, filling in only the pieces new to this season. The gag reel, however, is in plain sight on the menus this time, but it's still as funny as always.
Overall I was extremely pleased with this set. The only disappointing aspect to it was that now the best is behind is and there is only the end to look forward to.",1074211200,4,2307,4.57487922705314
1924782,5,B0000DGBEY,"This season was jam-packed with action, adventure and tragedy. What more can one want in a television series??
 Ok, so there's the comment that the Shadow War ends anti-climatically. But that's what happens with a war of ideology. It cannot be won with wars or force, and warring over ideas can seem sometimes trivial from the outside. How does one solve the who is right argument?
 What makes up for the lack of fighting is the Earth ""civil"" war and the Minbari Civil wars. Wars galore!, each with a purpose and meaning.
 The ""what happened to Mr Garibaldi"" question was answered frustratingly slowly, and the resolution didn't get enough resolution for me. We don't have to see how Sheridan came to trust Garibaldi again, but it would have been nice to get a little more closure on that subject. After all Garibaldi did, Sheridan couldn't just trust him, could he? Or maybe he could, and that's a telling characteristic of Sheridan, and a brilliant piece of unspoken writing by JMS.
 No flat characters here! Thanks to JMS and his dynamic writing, the characters of B5 twist and turn and show different sides to the audience with every new season, and every show within that season!
 The CGI has improved, despite their tight budgets, and the show was supposed to end this season! What a way to go out, had it done so! Luckily, we still get one more season! The actors are deeply rooted in their characters and it shows!, the story line is top-notch and engaging throughout, and everything is actually *happy* by the end of this season! A thoughtful and exciting show. Very satisfying at the end.
 Sadly, the end of the next, 5th and final season never gets closure, and the under-rated, under-funded ""Crusade"" never got off the ground. Pity. It needed proper treatment and respect and still does! I'm still hoping that someone somewhere will realise what a LOSS this story is uncompleted, and will fund it and treat it right. HOPE, everyone! It's what we've been taught to do!",1074124800,,1979,4.738372093023256
1924783,5,B0000DGBEY,"like season 3, season 4 was superb.  Unfortunately, because JMS thought there may not be a season 5, he rushed to cram almost everything into season 4 making it the most exciting season of the show and leaving himself a little dry for season 5.  No season of this show is really bad, and even though season 5 starts off slow, there is plenty still to come on this show.  On my t.v. and dolby pro-logic it looks and sounds great.  There are some scratches in the film, but to get the wide screen version, I understand they went back to the original negatives so they wouldn't have to crop the picture.  My only true disappointment is that every episode should have a commentary.  Not just one or two.  There are more cast members, crew, directors etc who could have contributed but alas it is not to be.  These sets are worth it for the show alone.",1073952000,3,847,4.350318471337579
1924784,5,B0000DGBEY,"Things are looking dark for our heroes.  As this year opens, Garibaldi is missing and Sheridan is missing, presumed dead.  Even though they are both alive (as we learn from the opening credits), things are dark.  The Vorlons and the Shadows are no longer hiding behind allies and have launched a full scale war, using the younger races as the targets.  Can Sheridan use what he's learned to bring a peaceful end to the fighting?  Plus there's the situation on Earth with dictator President Clark.  Throw in Garibaldi's weird behavior and you've got a full season that catches your interest and never lets go.
Since JMS didn't know for sure if he'd actually get season 5, he worked hard to bring major plot threads together in season 4.  As a result, this year is packed with action and story, but there are some wonderful character arcs as well.  I've always found Garibaldi's to be the most interesting of the season, but Vir gets some great moments early on as well.  Londo and G'Kar's relationship also takes some unexpected turns that are wonderful.  I love watching that duo at work.
Frankly, this season will always hold a special place in my heart because it's when I started watching.  Hard for me to believe now, but my first episode was ""Into the Fire.""  If it weren't for some very patient friends, I would have been lost, but I managed to stick in there, getting so hooked on the Earth plot that I couldn't stop watching.  Later, when I'd seen the rest of the show, I realized exactly what I had missed in way of back story.  Naturally, I don't recommend starting here.  The way JMS is able to bring plot threads together is truly amazing this season and worth every hour spent watching the first three seasons for the payoff (not that that's a chore by any stretch of the imagination.)  Still, I'll always have fond memories of waiting impatiently each week to see what happens next and the long wait over the summer to see how they'd resolve the mid season cliffhanger.
This DVD set is in perfect keeping with the others that have come out.  Picture quality is mostly good with the occasional grain or spot.  A tad distracting, but overall sharper then my video tapes.  Sound is wonderful in full surround.  Again we get three commentaries.  The cast commentary, featuring Bruce Boxleitner, Jerry Doyle, Peter Jurasik, and Patricia Tallman is entertaining if not very informative.  (I'll never look at Jerry's head the same way again, however.)  JMS does his usual two commentaries.  He's joined by director Michael Vejar on ""Face of the Enemy"" for a fascinating look at creating that pivotal episode.  And he does his usual interesting look at ""Deconstruction of Falling Stars,"" the unusual fourth season finale.  The special features are rounded out by an introduction on disc 1, a new documentary on the music of the show, a new suite of music set against visuals from the season, the usual data and personnel files, and finally a gag reel.  I will confess I almost missed this, but it was great.  Makes me wish more then ever that we'd gotten to see the gag reels from the previous seasons.
If you're a fan of this show, you must get this set.  It's worth every penny spent.  And if you've never seen the show, DVD is a wonderful way to discover this wonderful show.  I just suggest being smarter then I was and starting with season 1.",1073865600,44,3353,4.64176570458404
1924785,5,B0000DGBEY,There is by far more action per/second in the fourth season than in any 2 of the previous seasons combined.  Almost all the story lines started during the early episodes are brought to a satisfying conclusion.,1073779200,,209,4.805555555555555
1924786,5,B0000DGBEY,"Wow, the sound blew me away!  I could feel the jet engines rumbling.  Ok ok, I know that you can't hear engines rumble in space, I liked it anyway.  The voices are very clear and understandable.  There is only one audio track though, no DTS or stereo track.
The video was not nearly as good.  As other reviewers have reported, there are some problems.  I would still call it above average for a TV show.  The video quality was better than my cable signal.  It's in widescreen, of course (1:78:1).  Although the extras aren't as good as the previous seasons of B5, they are still much better than many other TV shows.  There's an easter egg, like the previous seasons.
It's hard to stop watching.  The episodes flow into each other and the tension increases throughout the season.  There are several references to prior seasons.  I don't recommend this DVD if you haven't seen the first three seasons, you won't get the full effect.  Excellent DVD set.",1073692800,3,951,4.616766467065868
1924787,3,B0000DGBEY,"I enjoyed the series of Babylon 5 very much, so I was anticipating my new boxed set of season 4 with all the extras. When I opened the box two disks were loose, and their movement inside the box had badly scrathced them. This had to have happened at the manufacturers, as the packaging is tight enough that if the disks had been properly placed on their center posts they would never have become loose through shipping. Now I have to send them back, wait to see if they refund it, and buy another set elsewhere (so I can hear if the package rattles. Beware of rattling disks, it is the sound disks being damaged)",1073606400,5,612,4.3304347826086955
1924788,5,B0000DGBEY,"Season 4 takes us on a rollercoaster ride. High tension and quiet introspection. Deft intrigue and sprited action.
In this one season we participate - for we cannot help become invested in the story - with the crew in
- ending the Shadow war, where the heroes had no chance to match the force of the Shadows
- a Minbari civil war
- an Earth civil war
- a season long sub-plot with a key individual
- love, peace, violence and death
Was the cast comprised of only the  greatest thespians? No.
Is the CGI starting to look a little rough? A bit.
Is the story constantly compelling? Damned straight!
As a season, this one is excellent. And Babylon 5 is exceptional as a whole.",1073520000,,672,4.376
1924789,5,B0000DGBEY,"I just got the S4 set today in the mail from Amazon (and it was only shipped yesterday free via USPS - I am impressed!)
I naturally set out to watch all the original stuff first - the commentary, specials, and bloopers.
I must say that the commentaries were subpar compared to the rest of the DVD sets. There were two main problems.
First, the cast commentary had too many people: Boxleitner, Doyle, Jurasik, and Tallman. When they were on, they were very, very funny. Through most of the episode (""Falling toward Apotheosis""), though, they seemed afraid of stepping on one another and so kept silent. They were also (bar Jurasik and especially Tallman) woefully ignorant of the episode, and so kept stating clunkers like ""why did I do this?"" The least they could have done was watch the episode ahead of time so as not to sound like boobs. When Doyle said ""Maybe I should have watched this series"" in the season 2 commnetaries it was funny. The joke has worn thin by now.
Second, JMS shares one of the commentaries with director Mike Vejar, and selects the mosy unlikely episode of them all for his own commentary. The co-Vejar ep, ""Faces of the Enemy"" is an excellent episode to show the directorial side of things, and Vejar should have been left to himself for that one. The solo JMS episode, ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"" wasn't worth a commentary. It was obviously quickly written, filmed, and edited to make the schedule to be shown at the end of season four (because it wasn't started until the beginning of season five, so it could replace the original season-four-ending ""Sleeping in Light"") and quite frankly was a clunker of an episode. JMS's commentary seems an attempt to lift up its rep but the show and his defense of it just demonstrate the severe (and understandable) shortcomings under which it was filmed.
I think JMS commentaries on ""The Long Night"" and ""Epiphanies"" would have been more appropriate (or maybe ""Endgame"" instead of one of the above).
As for the specials, to be totally picky, I loved the original Christopher Franke orchestral score done for the DVD, but have to ask why it couldn't have been done as a accompaniment to a chronological video representation of the series? As it is, the video messes with series sequence quite badly. In chrono order, it would have been more powerful and maybe could have been released to the music video channels as an ad for the DVD. Even better would have been the chrono vidoe with the music PLUS SOUNDS that made CF's work so striking. The purely musical element left out half of CF's repertroire.  What we get is beautiful, moving, and interesting, but also expectations that are never met.
The special on the musical scoring effects is the best special of the DVD seies to date, beating out (barely) season three's ""Making a Better Narn.""  Though mostly an understadable lovefest (for it is Franke's scoring which makes JMS's writing so emotionally moving) it still allows us to see the thinking behind how the scoring is accomplished.
I have only seen two actual eps, but they seem much superior in CGI to the earlier efforts.
This is the most action-packed of the B5 seasons, with both the Shadow War and the Earth War being resolved (prematurely in the latter case, as JMS thought that he wouldn't get a season 5), and I am looking forward to watching each episode, especialy because my VHS copies from on-air weren't all that hot to start with and have suffered from repeated viewings.
Any B5 fan has to have these DVDs. Non-B5 fans need to get the earlier ones (especially seasons 2 and 3) to get up to speed.  You will not be disappointed - the only people who are not B5 fans are those who don't know the series.
In summary, the overall emotional quality of this set seems a touch below that of the incomparable season 3 - which for my money was the best TV season ever in any genre. Technically, it it superior. Musically (espcially the incredibly moving intro score, which may be worth the series price in and of itself) it is also superior.
I'm gonna give it five stars because my complaints are so minor relative to the overall quality of the show.
As a side note to the goobers like me, JMS promises at the end of this DVD set that he will tells us ""lots of cools stuff"" in his commentary on season 5.
I for one cannot wait!",1073433600,3,4320,4.607792207792208
1924790,5,B0000DGBEY,"Science fiction is the only place where you'll find an avowed atheist like Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Strazynski exploring life after death. That's the nice thing about fiction you can dive into things, stir things up and see what happens. Season 4 of B5 begins with an ending. Our main character John Sheridan is dead having died on the enemy world of Z'Ha'Dum. If there's any doubt, we're reminded by a glimpse of the jump Sheridan made when he had his ship the White Star crash into the city of the damned. Sheridan jumped off a balcony of a building into the jaws of a pit two miles deep. That's about as dead as it gets. So clearly resurrection is the only option for Strazynsky and, not surprisingly, Sheridan does the only other known resurrection since Christ. All isn't as it appears, though and if B5 referenced a popular religious figure, it wasn't in an attempt to convert others to the cause against the Shadows. Sheridan destroyed Z'Ha'Dum, killed a large amount of human Shadow collaborators (including his wife Anna Sheridan but...well she wasn't his wife any longer but something else entirely). So if the Shadow War appears to end a bit prematurely forgive JMS; he got the feeling that B5 might not be renewed and, unlike some series creators, he wanted to conclude his epic even if it was premature. Strazynski brings his savior back to the nasty war being fought against the evil Shadows. He manages to reunite a splintering alliance and convert those characters still sitting on the fence about the war itself.
That meant that season 5 acted more as an extended coda for the war demonstrating the aftermath. Unfortunately, the dramatic conflict of a war is difficult to compete against and season 5 also had 4 previous well received seasons to work against. Nevertheless, season 5 is worth picking up for a number of outstanding episodes as well.
The highlights are many during season 4 which is probably the best season for the show. Highlights include ""The Big Burn"", ""No Surrender, No Retreat"" in which Sheridan takes on the corrupt Earth government which is continued in the arc episode ""Rising Star"" and ""The Deconstruction of Falling Stars"". The entire cast continued to give strong performances during season 4.
I hate to say it but the transfer here actually looks worse in spots than during season 3. There's numerous digital artifacts, edge enhancement and the grainy, dark images only highlight the weaknesses of this transfer. The opening episode is among the worst with lots of grain problems evident in just about every scene. The image quality improves periodically throughout the disc. So expect variable image quality. At its best, B4 looks very good, at its worst, it's problematic.
On the plus side, the analog artifacts have been reduced but it's not much of a trade off. It's a pity as it's unlikely that Warner will do another transfer of the series in the immediate future.  Reportedly, the discs were mastered from new widescreen transfers (remember, it's not anamorphic. Anamorphic refers to the use of a lens to distort and stretch the picture. Widescreen essentially means that it's been matted).
The optical effects vary in quality. In some scenes they look stunning while in others they are fuzzy looking. This is particularly noticeable in scenes where there's live action integrated with effects shots. I'm not really clear if this is due more to the higher frames per second ""speed"" for television or what was considered acceptable resolution when the series was produced. I had hoped that Warner Home Video might have solved this problem but I'm sure they probably had fairly tight budgets for revamping the series for DVD. No doubt sacrifices had to be made and it appears improving the resolution and sharpness of the opticals was one of them. It's not a huge distraction just a bit annoying at times.
The sound varies from fair to exceptional. I noticed a considerable amount of compression  during some episodes which made the dialog difficult to hear particularly if you listen to it in Surround Stereo. The remix is flat and static sounding dominant feature is dialogue. The sound quality varies from episode to episode with a lack of regularity.
The extras are just as nice as the previous boxed sets We're  treated to the season ending gag reel. I wish more boxed sets had these. It gives the viewer an inside peak into the fun and games that occur during the production of a series. We also get Data and Personal Files similar to previous seasons. They provide a bit of background on the characters and situations in the series.
There's two episodes with commentary tracks provided by series creator J. Michael Strazynski and one with most of the regular cast. The former commentaries are interesting but be warned that Strazynski mentions a number of spoilers on future episodes and the fifth season. The cast clearly are having a ball ribbing each other and their fun is infectious. I'd recommend watching the episodes without commentary the first time (particularly the ones with Strazynski commenting). Curiously, there's never been an episode with commentary by the effects supervisors or directors. It would have been interesting to hear about the creation of the optical effects and how an episodic director approaches an individual episode of a series.
Hidden inside this nicely packaged set is one of B5's finest seasons. The image and sound quality varies from very dicey to good. I'm a bit surprised given the fact that these are new digital transfers that the picture quality wasn't cleaned up a bit more. While there's less analog artifacts, the digital artifacts dominate much of the set. The sound quality varies from muddy and flat to very good. I'm curious if there were alternate scenes shot for European and Asian markets. If so, it might have been interesting to include these.
The B5 extras have always been excellent despite the budget limitations that exist at putting together these DVD sets. I would have liked to see more features on optical effects and compositing. The commentaries by Strazynski and the cast are enlightening and fun.",1073433600,2,6127,4.923597678916828
