6433501,4,B00KM0AUSU,"The phenomenon that The Rocky Horror Picture Show transcends what it was originally, like any classic movie should.  Picture yourself as a teenager in this day and age and you crack open the case on this movie and insert a Blu-ray into your player and a pair of shiny red lip-sticked lips and glowing white teeth start to sing to you...  What would your impression be of this movie?  Probably not what my impression is.  Rocky Horror is not for everyone.  It is not a good movie.  It's a traipsing of bad dialogue, strange sexual encounters, and ridiculous costumes.  The story is about a couple of geeky, sexually-repressed teens (Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick) that get caught in the rain when their car breaks down and wind up in a house inhabited by a transsexual (really just a cross-dresser) freaky scientist (Tim Curry) trying to manufacture a man for his homosexual delights and his bizarre staff of twisted denizens.

Songs abound.

That is Rocky Horror. Ridiculous.  Insane.  Debauched.

Sad but true. But wait...  Michael Rennie was ill the day the earth stood still...  The soundtrack is infectious.  It's just a jump to the left... Hmmmmmm.  Oh. Very infectious.  And the ridiculous debauchery of the story is really quite funny.  So come up to the lab, and see what's on the slab....Rocky Horror is a masterpiece of cinematic and musical genius.  It's a tongue-and-cheek nod at sexuality within the framework of haphazard 50's and 60's sci-fi/horror B-movie hilarity.  Ever see The day The Earth Stood Still?  The Thing From Outer Space?  Them?  Plan 9 From Outer Space? The Blob? Sci-fi movies were cheesy.  Classic but cheesy and Rocky Horror works in that vein as a purposeful homage.  There's a light, over at the Frankenstein place...  Curry is hilarious as Dr. Frank N. Furter.  Meatloaf rock and rolls in rockabilly rebellion as the dismembered (and slightly digested) miscreant Eddie.  Richard O'Brien. Susan Sarandon.  Barry Bostwich. Patricia Quinn. Nell Campbell.  Jonathan Adams. Peter Hinwood.  Classic casting.

Like I said.  Rocky Horror isn't for everyone.  Many people will see this movie as idiotic and juvenile and ask themselves what-the-f*ck? Homophobes need not apply at all.  But if you have a love for comedy, music and horrible B-movies, you will be amazed. On Blu-Ray this is about as good as it's ever going to look and sound so delight in that.  The transfer is clean and crisp, the soundtrack is resounding in its kick-ass brilliance. Embrace the phenomenon that Midnight Movies created from 1975 and forward, rose tint your world, and prepare to visit with the sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania.  Hot Patootie! Bless my soul!  I really love that rock and roll!

6433502,5,B00KM0AUSU,"Great version, love the extras.  Metal case is well made, not a cheap one like the wal-mart specials released at Christmas 2014 in stores.  Painted and anodized metal, not just a skin.  No embossing, though the pictures would lead you to think there is..",1425600000,2,254,4.7272727272727275
