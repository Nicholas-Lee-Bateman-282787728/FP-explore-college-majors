6567903,2,B00MC1F7UI,"Oddly, this is photographed with a  handheld camera from Grace's p.o.v., yet the character never holds a camera.  Her mother had been raped by a minister and then Grace's Grandma reluctantly and harshly raised her.  Then there was some sort of possession and...I don't remember much because it is very forgettable.",1414368000,2,314,5.117647058823529
6567904,1,B00MC1F7UI,"The idea of a film dealing with possession as seen through the eyes of the possessed seemed like an interesting concept, but fails badly here. Because of the way it's filmed, the movie has the same look and feel as a 'found footage' film including the awkward camera movements.

The acting here is laughably bad, especially by the main actress playing Grace. This is probably due to her fact that her lines were obviously dubbed in from a sound studio after the film was completed. The actors are all playing directly to the camera which really doesn't work here. Amateurish and not at all frightening. We actually found ourselves laughing unintentionally.",1441238400,,656,4.90990990990991

6567913,2,B00MC1F7UI,"It's actually pretty freaky that anyone thought this movie would be a good idea.

It's worth noting that a demon ends up punishing a priest for doing something horribly immoral.  The body count is also far smaller than most action hero movies rack up.  I think this makes a pretty good case that the movie glorifies Satan as the good guy.

As it should be.",1428192000,,356,4.430769230769231

6567916,1,B00MC1F7UI,"Grace: The Possession is a film told from the devil's point of view. It stars the gorgeous Alexia Fast,the sexy siren who seduced Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher,as the Grace,a beautiful college freshman that appears to be naive about the real world. But apparently,she appears to be possessed by devil,who has complete control of her mind and body. After an incident happens at the university where Grace is attending during a party,her grandmother takes her under her care and tries to seek the help of priests to free her from the devil's spell before things really get out of hand for Grace.

The film was definitely original as it was told from the devil's point of view as I have mentioned in the previous paragraph. The viewer may somehow have to adjust watching it as we see the camera moving in an awkward way wherein it focus towards to the character while speaking. Aside from depriving us of the virginal beauty of Alexa for most part of the film,the way the director shot the film proved to be somewhat more of a distraction to the viewer especially when some scenes are shot incoherently and the camera gets shaky from time to time.

As far as the story goes,there was nothing original as it was clich&eacute;d and predictable. What also bother me is it is somewhat subtly has anti-Catholic themes as it shows that Catholics including priest and deacons are helpless against the devil. Although it was pointed out that the grandmother is somewhat being punished after she left the church,it still could not hide the fact that the film portrays them to be absolutely helpless no matter how great their relationship is with the Lord. Finally,too bad that the movie wasn't adventurous enough to show something new story wise since what will be featured is something that one have already seen in other movies of the same genre.",1421971200,,1833,4.761006289308176

6567918,4,B00MC1F7UI,"A very unique first person point of view of possession. Even though I felt that all the ""cool stuff"" was shown in the trailer, I still loved watching it all the way through. Avoid watching the trailer for an even better experience if you can!",1419811200,,242,4.4
6567919,3,B00MC1F7UI,"Sometimes all we need to breathe life into a tired subject, specifically stated here as the demonic possession sub-genre, is a fresh perspective. Director Jeff Chan, who co-wrote the mostly intriguing script with Chris Pare, showcases this with a mostly first person perspective and just enough new ideas and creativity to give this often reaped topic the fresh jolt it needs. The movie mostly works, thanks to an adept and perfectly embodied performance by the main lead, Alexia Fast, of the innocent and naive school girl who finds herself slowly turning to the darkness around her and within.

  The movie has many layers of religious symbolism, Fast's character begins her descent into wickedness after acknowledging her subdued desires, that could come off as heavy handed. Luckily, it works well thanks to Chan's competent and gradual pace, his focus on characters and a wonderfully wily performance from Lin Shay as Fast's overly Christian grandmother. As she proved with her high caliber portrayals in the ""Insidious"" films and ""Ouija"" she often get's typecast in these roles. Given how consistently wonderful she is at this off the walls genre types it is easy to see why she is so often cast this way.

  There are the usual familiar elements which weigh it down. The film begins predictably in a University setting and ends in a church. Many of her peers are the stereotypical genre teenage partiers, the attempts at a romantic sub-plot which brings the ""beast"" to the surface are strained and there is nothing particularly unique, outside of the first person perspective,  about the opening twenty minutes or so.

  The best ideas come, appropriately,  near the finale with surprisingly good effects and somewhat of a surreal tone to the concluding act. By than Fast has made the character her own believable entity and there is enough emphasis on her struggles to make us care, the underpinnings of her recently discovered sexuality will resonate with many viewers and it succeeds in many of the risks it tales to be an above average entry in the genre.

  Even if the ending is deliberately taken from William Peter Blatty's novel and William Friedkin's film of the same name, ""The Exorcist"" , it's an enjoyable wink at the audience. It may not be as original of a conclusion as this movie feels it is leading to, or that it deserves,  but so much else works, and still this finale never seems desperate or cheap in context as it may sound, that the audience winks back in enjoyment.  Helped by it's brief 86 minute run time it is too the point, courageous and original enough to be worth seeing.",1418947200,,2610,4.8710407239819
6567920,4,B00MC1F7UI,"Grace was a real good film, at first i was like ""oh great its in like a first person shot"" type way, but i started to really like it! it was creepy, I'm a horror movie buff, major critic also, the ending was kind of like a i don't know...and a i don't think it's possible for that then i had to think about all the other demonic things i have seen that other film makers have done, history of things..but i do REALLY like it. i'd definitely buy it again for someone as a gift it's a good flick!",1418774400,,494,3.95
6567921,2,B00MC1F7UI,Terrible camera work.,1418515200,,21,6.333333333333333
6567922,1,B00MC1F7UI,"Most of the movie is done like home recording way too many scenes of Grace's feet and her hands nervously fiddling with the skirt part of her dress. Unlike The Exorcist, The Possession etc where you see full scenes play out you will not see that in this film instead it's like someone running around with a camera at first the scenes are shaky, if not for that this would have been an epically amazing movie

Things I hate most

1 Grace's grandmother dear god for a bible thumping religious fanatic she is dumb. In church the priest puts a communion wafer in Grace's mouth and immediately the poor girl vomits it out along with a good sized amount of blood. What does grandma do? You may ask drags Grace out the front door of the church ranting about humiliating her. I was thinking target aquired please somebody give me a gun, bang, bye granny

And before all that the sudden very strange behavior in a kind calm docile girl who did mention something was in her head big warning sign there. In one part grandma actually tells Grace she should have never been born, nice goin granny you suuuuuck. Ooooo does she get her comuppance near the end, muwhahaha smiles evilly

2 The demon can enter the church without burning and wreak havoc tossing the priests around, making them lose their hold of the cross etc, we all know when an evil being tries to enter a church pain and burning follow

I do however give major props for the exorcism that was good very creepy I was like holy crap. But I hate what happened in the end. The characters are great and the actors did an above excellent job love em",1418342400,,1596,4.414965986394558

6567924,2,B00MC1F7UI,"Grace (Alexia Fast) is a college age girl who hallucinates, has night mares, and is sexually frustrated having never bumped up against a washer in the spin cycle. Her mother (Alexia Fast) died during child birth and it appears Grace may have a touch of possession...if you happen to read the title to the film. After a bad passing out experience at Midleton [sic] State University, she returns home to live with an overly religious and protective grandmother (Lin Shaye).

The film is shot through a ""Grace eye view."" We see what she sees, so it feels like we are watching a hand held camera film. We don't see much of Grace unless she looks in a mirror.

If you think about what a possession film would look like made by low budget Canadians, this is it.  2 1/2 stars

Okay as a Redbox rental.

6567926,3,B00MC1F7UI,"Good acting, great audio and angle in which it was shot. The ending however, in the last 10 minutes was too over the top ""noisy"".",1416873600,,129,4.2
6567927,3,B00MC1F7UI,"This is one of those films that walks the thin line between being just okay and possibly great; the acting is decent, the production values are through the roof, and the special effects are convincing. Everything that would make a movie like this a roaring success. But it was just missing that one element that make for classic cinema. Some of the camera tricks are amazing, and the last 15 minutes made for a very compelling ending, but the set up took too long, and by the time it was over, I was not as amused as I thought I was going to be. The team responsible for this movie are obviously talented, it shows in every aspect of this film. I just wish that they had the right material to showcase this. Overall, not the worst movie ever made, but it is certainly forgettable.",1416268800,,780,4.386206896551724
6567928,2,B00MC1F7UI,"As others have mentioned about the premise of this story being told and retold in one form or another over the years and much more effectively by some than IN this version.
A young woman strikes out on her own to attend college after living a very strict and religious life under the watchful eye of grandmama. Her mom died during childbirth or did she, so her only memories come from dear old grandmama NOT!
The girl experiences problems at school and is sent home after her release from the hospital. There isn't much to the story so if I give any details you'll know all there is to know. She begins to piece together her mothers history and realizes just what happened to her mom and who her father might be or is or????
This is an ok movie with ok acting, direction, cinematography and a not so good script.
There just wasn't much to the story to set it apart from the pack and its so transparent that you know very early on everything you need to know about the characters and the story to stop it and watch something else.
There is drug and alcohol use and cursing including the fword and sexual dialogue without any nudity that takes place on the college campus and at grandmama's house (sex)",1414886400,2,1200,4.40990990990991

6567930,3,B00MC1F7UI,"The thing that I remember most about this film is getting bored with looking at Grace's feet.  Although a good idea to shoot from Grace's point of view, I would've appreciated a variety of camera angles as opposed to the seemingly unending view of the two feet walking.  At one point I lost it, laughing uncontrollably at myself for watching as it's obvious that we were only going to get the view from above.  Instead of listing the actress, I suggest you give credit where credit is due (or clearly not due) to her feet!

6567932,2,B00MC1F7UI,"The first person view was really the only somewhat novel aspect of this film. I actually, for the first 20-30 minutes, really thought this film was going some place interesting, especially as the lead actress has been quite good in other roles, and, again, the camera angle (I hoped) was going to really develop this into something above the usual b-movie horror fare. Sadly, the film just ends up the typical cliched Devil vs overzealous church family dynamic we've seen so many times before. The last 10 minutes, in particular, were so filled with cliched dialogue that it went from just being another bland recital of the same film we've seen so many times before, to disappointingly...well...lame. No interesting plot twists, no real scares (other than one ghost scene that actually caught me), and really just an average walk-through in the acting department. It's not a terrible film, but it's really just one you can throw on the pile of average b-movies and wait for it to come out on Amazon Prime or Netflix one day.
