5712469,5,B00CBMWLU2,"the star's career has taken off so much that there are only four episodes in this third season.  however, the high quality continues in each episode.  as usual, he not only has to figure out the mystery and solve it but also survive the plots of those in the department who are after him.  The black policewoman who was after him last season ups the ante this season, trying to recruit his partner as an informer. meanwhile, Luther is busy solving the cases.  Indris Elba who plays Luther is a terrific actor and is now starring in movies as well.  Netflix streaming also carries this series. i love the music in the series too.

the humdinger of a story in this series is a vigilante, tom marwood, who is trying to avenge his murdered wife by murdering criminals. although he is initially sympathetic, as tom gets more out of control, he becomes a menace to society in general and Luther in particular. in this episode we also see the return of red haired Alice, who looks out for Luther even though she is a criminal fugitive.  although Luther has a new girlfriend, mary, i frankly can see him with Alice better.

there is only one aspect i didn't care for but i suspect it is personal to me and i have put it as a spoiler below.

update with POSSIBLE SPOILERS:  one of my frequent readers took me to task about such a short review of Luther.  i commented back that something had bothered me about season three but i could not figure out what it was.  i have now figured it out and i am rather surprised at myself.  what bothers me about this series of Luther is that there is heavy involvement in the cases of two cops doing an internal affairs investigation of him and trying to get him dismissed.  i was a huge fan of Rebus by Ian Rankin.  But I could not stand his new series on an internal affairs cop and stopped reading it. i loved Denzel Washington in TRAINING DAY where he won an Oscar for playing a cop gone bad.  Other than that film, however, I really hate these tv shows about incompetent cops trying to remove someone who is getting the job done.  I absolutely HATED the black woman policeman and the Scot male policeman, who with coarse and heavy handed methods, investigate Luther. i think the moral for me is that i personally am done with internal affairs plotlines. if you are not, this is otherwise up to the excellent standards of the prior two seasons.  in all good conscience, i cannot mark something down because something is hitting my own personal buttons.

5712470,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Season three returns the series to the quality exhibited in the first season.
While the casting and acting is always excellent, season two lacked the gripping story lines from season one.
Season three corrected this with above average villains and one somewhat sympatric.
The overall story is a special team investigating Luther, read get em, that is going outside of normal procedure.
The season is two stories in four episodes on two DVDs, with about four hours of viewing.
While not as good as season one, this is much better than season two and well worth buying.",1487376000,,567,4.855670103092783

Idris is a masterful actor who commands a presence but is at the same time very vulnerable.  He has the utmost confidence in his judgment and you are never quite sure which way he will turn, which makes this series fun and exciting.  See the full series without a doubt.

In ""Luther,"" he uses the rather tired trope of ""tortured cop with troubled personal life Breaks The Rules to catch bad guys"" to create a powerful and compelling character (see, for example, Luther's grudging acceptance of a homeless teenage girl, and his inescapable fascination with sociopathic killer Alice).

5712667,4,B00CBMWLU2,I enjoyed all 3 seasons of the series Luther staring Idris Elba. The episodes were fast pace and kept me on the edge of my seat. Elba plays a very complex character and he carries the lead role very well. The only thing I didn't like about the series was the number of episodes per season. It would have been nice if the stories were drawn out over 10 or 13 episodes instead of four. I hope that there are more seasons ahead for this character.,1415059200,,444,4.174418604651163
5712668,5,B00CBMWLU2,I've heard about this series in passing and decided to give it a chance one weekend. Really glad I did. It's very original with impressive acting and an original take on detective work. I had a time getting through the British accent at times so I had to turn on my close caption to assist but that didn't hamper my enjoyment. I'm only sorry it was only 3 seasons long.,1414800000,,369,4.285714285714286

Spoiler alert: When will the next season which ought to be titled 'The Neverending Adventures of Luther and Crazy. Loved it. The BBC knows drama and crime. The BBC also knows what good, quality entertainment is all about. Luther is fearless, gritty, contains characters whom you really care about. This character driven 3 season series makes you want more and more and more. Like I have said before, if it has 'BBC' connected to it, it is guarenteed to make the waching of it worth your time and effort.",1413936000,,572,4.73

5712694,5,B00CBMWLU2,Better Best ..It is nice to see as well as think while looking at a TV program. I guess I am used to watching American TV so much I just forgot how it is to see a story come together without a lot of sex etc. Idris Elba is Luther from his deep look to his strange dress code or whatever he calls his fashion. This is something like a good book you hate to see it end.,1412380800,,367,3.717948717948718

Thankfully it looks like there will be.  The acting was superb and the creators and writers are on a par by themselves.  This was the most exciting and engrossing series I have seen in a very long time.  Wish there was going to be a season five, six and more. Once you've watched it you will feel the same, I guarantee it.

5712720,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Idris Elba is a powerhouse of an actor with his deep voice and imposing size yet as DCI John Luther we find a mix of gentleness and toughness. Season 3 of LUTHER brings the series to a close and the best of the previous two seasons are combined with new characters and stories to make the final episode shocking and satisfying.

John Luther has a new assortment of serial killers and criminals to fight in Season 3. Somehow Luther always gets his man or woman--whatever the case may be. Luther has a new love interest Mary Day played by the lovely Sienna Guillory. We see his softer, gentler side just as his world is crashing down. Nemesis DCI Erin Gray teams up with an unsavory former detective George Stark (David O'Hara) to bring Luther down by charging him with murder. It seems like everyone close to Luther ends up murdered. Is it murder by association or is Luther scheming to destroy everyone around him.

Luther's methods are unconventional and it is here that he often does the wrong thing for the right reasons and he tries to solve crimes. The moral dilemma becomes clear when he butts heads with a vigilante killer out for justice - his way. The line between right and wrong become blurred and everyone around Luther is in jeopardy.

The last episode has some shocking surprises. Delightful Ruth Wilson returns and the mysterious and murderous Alice Morgan. It's clear all the actors in LUTHER are phenomenally talented and the casting director assembled a dream cast of talented actors. LUTHER 3 will keep you riveted with anticipation as to what is to come next. The only disappointment is this is the last season of LUTHER. We want more!",1410220800,,1655,4.680412371134021

5712726,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Luther was/is a departure from what you would think of a police drama. Since it's British, there was no gun play by the detectives. Just good old reasoning.

The interesting part is his relationship with Alice. Their opposites and making sure the they had each other's back was great.

The other thing that is/was different is the fact the on BBC America, if you can tell a story in four episodes, then that is your season. There was no overkill for the sake of a twenty two episode season. That was refreshing. It leaves you wanting more.

If it were longer, I still would have watched.",1409443200,,587,4.518867924528302

5712750,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Superb acting, especially when it comes to Idris Elba and Ruth Wilson.  The plots stretch the bounds of reality a bit, but what crime drama doesn't.  Elba does a marvelous job portraying a basically optimistic individual that has become bogged down by the fatigue, despair, anger, and sadness that arise from the victims and psychopaths he encounters in his profession.  There is none of the over the top cynicism one might expect given the character and the plots.  Wilson's character, Alice Morgan, is completely unbelievable, but her acting is so good I was perfectly willing to suspend belief and simply enjoy her moments on the stage.  She provides the few comedic moments in the series and is simply fun to watch.  The series is well filmed with an excellent score to accompany the plot.  For those used to CSI-Whatever levels of violence, be warned this show is graphic and bloody.  Bring on the full length movie!",1407888000,,921,4.858974358974359

The characters are so well developed, the story lines are crisp, fresh, and truthfully, frightening. Idris Elba, who is Luther, is a complex character, who by Season 3 is understood by the viewers. Elba is gloriously handsome and a fine actor to boot. After Luther, it is hard to get interested in other crime oriented cable and tv shows.

5712833,3,B00CBMWLU2,"We found this series not as good as the first 2. It was still exciting but many of the victims in it could have done a lot more to help themselves, so this was annoying. You know, why is she sitting in the wardrobe when she should be phoning the police on her cell phone and running down the road to the neighbours for help? Also the ""police plot"" against Luther seems to be getting fantastical and is not at all believable in terms of police procedures for internal affairs.",1403654400,,475,4.288888888888889

This was an amazing British series that I watched because Idris was in it, plain and simple.  I am one of a million women that would watch anything he's in.  But you stay for Luther because of the superb writing, acting and Alice.  I hear there will be a movie.  Can't wait.  And I hope they are smart enough to have Alice in that as well.  If you don't know who Alice is, you must not be watching Luther.  And if you like cop shows and mystery genre you will enjoy Luther.",1403308800,,568,4.0

5712840,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Luther is a very well done British crime show. Idris Elba is a brilliant actor.
Ruth Wilson who plays Alice is also spectacular.
I am disappointed that there will not be a fourth series.",1402790400,,186,4.5
5712841,4,B00CBMWLU2,"This four parter 'Luther' series satisfies some of what I hoped Luther would become. It seems John Luther, played by Idris Elba, the rogue policeman, is his description, will always be on the outside looking in. The man who cares too much about the crimes of injustice, just does not have enough time to look for his own life. That seems to be the way with the stand out English Detective series, something keeps these cops from fulfilling their lives.

This time, Luther has a lot going on. He has an old murder case that has come alive, and quite a strange one at that. John Stark from another detective series, has come out of retirement to pursue Luther for who knows what. Someone in Internal Affairs has a thing about Luther. This part of this series was so far fetched, in my opinion, it never should have been included. It detracted from anything sensible, and the unbridled violence from Stark was not conducive to the tale. Luther's partner may be off track, and Luther really wants to share his life with someone. Luther is an excellent detective, knows his job, but seems to have very little insight into himself.

And, then, along comes Alice Morgan, played by Ruth Wilson, that delicious sociopath. The killer who loves Luther or something like that. She brightens up the series with her wit and cleverness. She is exactly what the series was missing. I loved watching her, Ruth Wilson can become her character, the look, the wink, the raise of the eyebrow. This woman deserves a show of her own. But back to Luther, Alice can do what Luther can't, and the combination makes a perfectly fine pair. After the violence and the guns and the nails, we settle down to Luther doing what he does best.

5712842,4,B00CBMWLU2,"I have had a hard time with Season 3 of Luther; the endless ugly violence, mostly against vulnerable women, far more graphically shown than in Season 1. There's a great shot from under the bed though, showing a woman taking off her shoes, true tension there. But lacks the psychological fascination of earlier episodes. And the whole internal affairs investigation of Luther seems tenuous and cheesy. I couldn't take my eyes off of Seasons 1 and 2, but I could barely stand to look at most of Season 3.",1402531200,,502,4.651685393258427

5712882,4,B00CBMWLU2,"We enjoy British mystery series -- they are much better than our own.  This series was all too brief - 14 episodes in 3 seasons.

Actor Idris Elba has created a wonderfully complex, intriguing character.  John Luther is a London police detective whose hot temper and willingness to bend the rules are turned into effective weapons in stopping serial killers.

The fact that Luther is a black man (Elba's parents hail from Sierra Leone and Ghana) is never mentioned by him or by any other character in the series.  He is presented simply as a stunningly handsome, brilliant and flawed man whose career is constantly in danger of being derailed by his compulsion to stop his prey by any means necessarily.

Police protocol (and at times, the letter of the law) go by the wayside as he cunningly ferrets out the killers from the hundreds of likely suspects his able team identifies - employing logic, computer databases and London's thousands of CCTVs.

Luther's superiors and coworkers consistently doubt him, his methods, and his leaps of deductive reasoning, and he is frequently under investigation by Internal Affairs and unrelentingly targeted by envious coworkers for character assassination

His love life is much less successful than his detective work, and the women in his life, including wife Zoe (beautiful Indira Varma) and suspected murderer Alice (a young Ruth Wilson, whose seductively curled lower lip speaks volumes), are as problematic as they are attractive.

You'll have to pay for season three (4 episodes, $10.99 for the season), but the first two seasons (10 episodes) are available for free to Amazon Prime customers.

Superior cast and scene shots we don't normally associate with the UK from travel shows and advertisements. Wish they could have continued the series...it would have well been worth watching!,1395878400,,324,4.803571428571429
5712902,4,B00CBMWLU2,This is an intellectual series. It won't turn your brain to mush. I would really like some more of it.,1395705600,,102,4.15
5712903,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Amazing show. Watched most on Netflix but had to watch the remainder. The show, to date will not be renewed but a movie production is underway. Very excited to see it. This shown in its entirety,  has prompted the most discussion of any show we have ever watched.",1395705600,,263,4.479166666666667

clever and very enjoyable

would love to see another season",1395705600,,117,4.086956521739131
5712905,5,B00CBMWLU2,Love his acting in this series. Luther is a man with angst and deep feeling running out of control but with a balanced sense of righteousness. He knows how to solve problems and is the detective you want working your case when you have a need. Elba is an accomplished underused actor and also a musician. Look up some of his lyrics and songs. Elba is great fun to watch and extremely entertaining and talented.,1395705600,2,410,4.48
5712906,4,B00CBMWLU2,Luther season three was very good. The first season was my favorite. Fans of the show won't be disappointed. If you enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 you will enjoy this one. Recommended for fans of Idris Elba.,1395705600,,200,4.4324324324324325
5712907,5,B00CBMWLU2,"My husband and I are very sad to see the series end.  Each of the seasons in the series has 2 discs only, and the stories are great.  The acting is wonderful, and, if you need help, 2 and 3 have English subtitles.  Luther is a disappointed, almost broken, man, due to the disappointments in his personal life.  Will he meet wsomeone else?  Will Alice, the sociopath who l;oves him, capture his attention?  You'll have to watch this short series.",1395619200,,445,4.5

5712909,5,B00CBMWLU2,The show has not lost its vigor. Several other shows that I've watched seemed to fizzle as it neared the end. Not this one though. Hoping for a season 4.,1395360000,,153,4.133333333333334

5712916,4,B00CBMWLU2,"the main characters are intense a well meaning cop with an explosive side, anything to get the job done and a sociopath that will do any thing for Luther for now. She like you aunt Shirley you have locked away,you go visit but as the sign says BEWARE.",1394755200,,251,4.25
5712917,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Idris Elba is spectacular, the story lines are compelling, and the acting is brilliant throughout.

5712919,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Idras Elba is mesmerizing, and the show features the greatest female sociopath ever. What's not to like?

5712923,5,B00CBMWLU2,"I was thrilled when I saw that Luther was back for a season three! I was not disappointed. Season three has the same dark complexity of the previous seasons and then some. John Luther's enemies are even closer at hand but he discovers that he has allies he didn't expect. I've only watched two episodes so far but the plot line was intriguing, the characters dark and gritty and the entire story kept me enthralled until the conclusion. Luther does certainly explore the darker side of human nature but it does it with such an honesty that you will barely question Luther's own sometimes questionable ethics. He doesn't always follow the rules but he does always have a very strong sense of what is right and what is wrong.",1394496000,,723,4.612403100775194
5712924,4,B00CBMWLU2,"Series 3 has it all:  suspense, romance, tragedy, showing a range of emotion for hard-bitten DCI Luther.  In Series 3, the show returns to top form after what was arguably a weaker Series 2. Excellent job by supporting cast members Warren Brown and Ruth Wilson.  Idris Elba, as usual, sizzles.",1394409600,,293,4.82

5712926,5,B00CBMWLU2,What an amazing tv show this is! It has always pushed the envelope and I love how rich and dark and complicated this world that Luther lives in is. The return of Alice was also a wonderful bit of writing.,1394236800,2,204,4.125
5712927,5,B00CBMWLU2,it was amazingly emotion provoking the characters meld very well together and the creator of the show is magnificent at writing a plot.,1394150400,,135,4.913043478260869

5712930,3,B00CBMWLU2,"The first season was good, second was okay, this one's silly. The plot-lines just get more and more unbelievable, and the implied social commentary more ridiculous.

Don't waste your money; wait 'til it comes out on Netflix.",1393891200,,224,5.054054054054054

5712933,5,B00CBMWLU2,Great series!!! I was really hoping for a much stronger opening for the 3rd season but was still wonderful watching this season.,1393718400,,128,4.863636363636363
5712934,5,B00CBMWLU2,"This is excellent casting and acting. Sophisticated and suspenseful. The character, John, is strong and vulnerable at the same time. I'm enthralled once again by a series and glad to have access to it on Amazon. Thanks.",1393718400,,219,4.945945945945946

 That's  just my opinion",1393718400,,154,4.666666666666667
5712937,4,B00CBMWLU2,Luther is up there on my Top 5 Binges.  Edge of your seat excitement with interesting characters. Hooked after first episode!  Only wish there was more to watch!,1393632000,,161,4.714285714285714

5712939,5,B00CBMWLU2,This is one of the best television cop show series I have ever had the pleasure to view!  I am devastated that the series has ended.  I want more Luther!!,1393545600,,154,4.1
5712940,4,B00CBMWLU2,"I really do like this show.  The acting is good, the characters are interesting.  Idris Elba deserves every bit of the accolades he gets.  Honestly, I miss Alice.  The dynamic and relationship they had going added a lot to the story line and I wish they would have done more ""consulting"" (ahem!) together. :)  Not sure about the story with the other DCI trying to take down Luther...I wasn't a huge fan of the DCI Erin Gray story.  But, overall, really interesting and well developed.",1393545600,,484,4.635294117647059

5712949,4,B00CBMWLU2,Simply put - Idris Elba is THE man!!!  Stringer Bell and John Luther - two completely different characters but Elba makes them both seem equally believable.  The stories this season have a certain level of predictability - but the acting is superb.  Great show - sorry that they stopped the series but hopeful that they come out with the movie.,1392854400,,344,4.7

5712958,3,B00CBMWLU2,"I loved Season One, liked Season Two, and was baffled by Season Three.  What happened?!?!??!  At the very end they brought in the mesmerizing Alice from Season One, and she markedly improved things.  Maybe she was out on pregnancy leave or something so they had to write her out for awhile and she's back for the next season.  I hope so.",1392422400,,337,4.475409836065574
5712959,5,B00CBMWLU2,"This is top notch. All the characters are tightly drawn, and really unique. Lots of unexpected turns, Luther's homicidal friend is unlike any character I have ever seen. Great story inventiveness, acting and sets and atmosphere, all really work, and are convincing. The best of the unlikely but somehow realistic despite extreme situation crime drama. Bomb scene in the truck is way inventive and intelligently conceived. I say it's the best of the genre out there right now, next to ""The Killing"" and ""The Fall"". Go for it. Idris Elba rocks, makes a significant contribution to the driven compelled and tortured cop persona. You can't help but love the guy even though he's a super smart wack job. Lot's of fun.

5712975,4,B00CBMWLU2,"Pros: Alice returns and Luther is as richly complex as ever.
Cons: The whole investigation of Luther seems forced and non-sensical.  So much obvious evidence has to be ignored to believe anyone would take that investigation seriously.  It could have been done--if they'd focused on different material from his past.  But the assumptions jumped to by the two investigators negates any credibility they have and seems like too cheap a way of get the audience to feel indignation.",1391385600,,477,5.089743589743589

So, start with season one if you haven't already.  Then go ahead and watch the White Chappel series, too.  This will help you a little once you cant get a Luther fix anymore.  That said,  there's reallly not much of a replacement for luther. D@mn shame.",1390867200,,299,4.444444444444445

5712987,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Was worried it'd taper off, but, manthat 1st episode alone is worth ittruly terrifying.
Season 3 has great suspense, tragedy, anti-hero-ness, and even a little flirting (if you're into that.)",1390435200,,191,5.4

5712991,5,B00CBMWLU2,I have followed Luther from the beginning. I love the character of John Luther and his relationship with Alice Morgan. The constant question that you ask yourself what would you do in Luther's situation. I wish that they would do either a movie or a few more seasons.,1390262400,,267,4.583333333333333
5712992,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Each episode was spellbinding and intense. Idris Elba is surely one of the finest actors today. Superb directing and writing by Neil Cross and loved Ruth Wilson in her extraordinary role as Alice Morgan. ""Luther"" is a series I could watch a number of times. Loved it immensely!!",1390003200,,278,4.8125

5712994,5,B00CBMWLU2,I love Idris Elba! He is an excellent actor. The series is riveting and exciting. I wished the season had more episodes and hope that BBC continues doing other seasons.,1389830400,,168,4.633333333333334
5712995,5,B00CBMWLU2,This show is a well acted display of skill and wit on the part of the actor and the producers. Not many are aware that London itself is a character in the series.,1389830400,,162,3.9393939393939394

5712997,5,B00CBMWLU2,Maintains the quality of previous seasons while adding a plot twist that forced Luther to show some accountability. It was one of the best shows in the bbc while it aired.,1389744000,,171,4.548387096774194
5712998,5,B00CBMWLU2,Best season yet.  All the complex drama between the main characters carries into the new season with fresh twists.  For me the thrilling action of pursuing murderers is second to the drama among the main characters--on either side of the law.  Wonderful series.,1389657600,,261,5.023255813953488
5712999,5,B00CBMWLU2,"This is a very short series which really did disappoint me, but frankly it was incredibly well done.

Both my Wife and I sat down and watched all three season over the course of a single weekend! We simply could not stop!
The acting was compelling and believable. The story line was riveting (and shocking at times). I really want to know what is going on in the lives of the ""FICTIONAL"" Characters...",1389657600,,401,4.493150684931507

5713002,5,B00CBMWLU2,"I was not sure about this series at first, but got hooked fast.  I do have  problem with Amazon giving two  or three seasons free on Prime then makes the current available season pay-view.

Anyway, back to Luthur...very well written and acted. Idris Elba  is intense and could overpower his cast mates but they hold their own and then some. The villains can make on shiver with fright and disgust...but then we get Alice who is he best villain of all. The sexual tension between she and Luther jumps off the screen like a hot chunk of coal. I keep wondering which of the two might kill the other.

American tv needs to take some lessons from the BBC and learn to rely on well  written character driven stories. .
After watching shows as well crafted as Luther and others I cannot sit thru  an episode of most acclaimed crime series on US tv.",1389398400,2,841,4.415584415584416

The best part of this season is the unveiling of a softer side of DCI Luther.  Too bad there won't be a season 4. We'll have to wait for the movie.",1389312000,,399,4.32

5713007,4,B00CBMWLU2,"Luther is a complicated, flawed personality who seems to become more alienated from people the more he tries to help them. Luther creates suspicion, jealousy and frustration among co-works and superiors and fear and distrust in those who try to get close to him. Only Luther would end up with the ""bad"" girl at the end. When it is done you are not sure if she is going to love him or shoot him in the back when he isn't looking. Unusual anti-hero portrayal stimulates this interging character study.

5713010,1,B00CBMWLU2,I enjoyed Seasons 1 & 2 but this Season the writers must have been on crystal meth.  The story lines were laughable.  By the third episode I kept watching only to seem how much stupider the plot would get... and it kept getting more and more stupid.  The BBC should be embarrassed for airing such drivel.,1389139200,,304,4.392857142857143

Question: How is it possible that Midsomer Murders can last 20,21years...i don't know,too long in my opinion but a fresh new show like Luther end with only 3 seasons under it's belt ? Makes no sense to me either,but that's what happened and we're just gonna have to live with it....oh well. the funny this was, is that i didn't know i that i was watching the finale as i was watching it,i was reading one of the reviews here and it gave me the impression that this was it for the show,so i looked it up on Wikipedia and BAM it was comfirmed. This series is excellent and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves crime/drama tv. Speaking of crime & drama might i suggest the BBC miniseries Father & son starring Dougray Scott and Reece Noi it has four parts to it and costs like $5.99 0r something.

5713060,3,B00CBMWLU2,"There was nothing, nothing better than seasons 1 and 2 of Luther.  That said, I was dismayed and disappointed by the hodgepodge of the last season.  It seemed rushed; chaotic, way, way over-melodramatic.  Where did the band come from?  How were they taught to intrude on every dramatic scene. The music was superfluous; the acting, except for Idris, was strained even weird.  This was the best dramaa on TV without question.  But the spoiler is season 3. It was just forced and not memorable..",1387497600,2,493,4.809523809523809
5713061,5,B00CBMWLU2,"I think that about sums it up.  Nothing is black and white in this show - boundaries, morals, lines... they're all shades of grey and the characters struggle with what parts of their soul they have to trade for justice and the consequences of their choices.  They feel the pain of the murders they work and it affects them deeply.

Like real life.

The acting by Alba (all the characters, really) is subtle and deep.  I haven't enjoyed TV this much in a long time. I did like Alice better - hope they bring her back.",1387238400,,516,4.333333333333333

5713064,5,B00CBMWLU2,"LUTHER is is by far the best televised crime based series show on the market. Its beyond a typical crime show like law and order and criminal minds both of which I enjoy. This takes it to the next level. IT even tops most movies I've seen. I can't wait until the prequel movie comes out. Most shows in the end you know the good guy will be the good guy and the bad guy will get hurt/caught. That is boring and predictable episode after episode which is not the case with Luther. This show right here is the definition of unpredictable. Go ahead and guess what is next and you will be wrong every time. Luther's character is AMAZING! I promise you will want to watch all seasons in one day. IT will be extremely hard to focus on a project or exam once you get started watching this series because you will be drawn to keep watching against your freewill. I watched episodes while I was walking on my way to work, on lunch breaks, I mean anywhere with internet access. The way the crimes are solved are so drama filled that it takes more than one episode to solve the crime. THE SERIES IS EPIC!",1387065600,,1092,4.2548076923076925
5713065,5,B00CBMWLU2,"I must say get your glass of wine or scotch only if you prefer, and get ready to use the left hemisphere of your brain. In which, I mean your analytical skills. This season of Luther has done it once again. I have never been a fan of detective drama such as NCIS, Criminal Mind, Law & Order, and etc. Mainly due to America's standards on moral compass. I mean must you always do what is legally moral or what is humanly moral? Well, I let Luther answer these question for you.

The reality that the director render to the viewers is by far the most vivid portrayal of what impaired criminal minds inhabits the urban jungle of New England. How Batman Gotham city is suppose to feel, dark, grimey, and unable to be saved. In reality there are times where a detecive can not solve an unethical situation with ethical protocol. However, most TV shows/Movies use the ""ethical"" route to solve each crime because it is morally correct. This is what made most drama series distasteful to me and also due to the fact that by the first 15 mintues of the show it was already predictable who the culprit was.

If you're looking for something that finally has the substance you've been waiting for this is it! Far from the norm. After my review, I still feel that I have not done justice to this show's caliber. That my words have only tainted its credibility. AMAZING!!!!",1387065600,5,1359,4.475806451612903

5713088,5,B00CBMWLU2,"Like the series ""Orphan Black"", Luther is compelling, unpredictable, and thoroughly enjoyable to watch.  Season 3, like the previous 2 seasons, shows the darker side of London and its policing. The season's four episodes while focusing on two new cases, also wraps up some tantalizing questions/loose ends from the earlier seasons.  The bonus was the return of Alice in the last episode, the quirky confident narcissistic sociopath that helps to make the series what it is. All three seasons convey, as they should, that policing, good/evil, is always a gray area, neither black nor white.  There are no easy solutions. All the main actors in this series are excellent in their respect roles and this series deserves to be watched.  I'll let you discover the plot lines yourself.",1385424000,,779,5.0625

They had no real evidence on Luther but were somehow given wideranging authority to invade Luther's house, kidnap his girlfriend and harass him based on nothing more than some pictures of dead people. I think the writers could have come up with something more compelling so the audience questioned whether Luther could actually be in trouble. Instead the writers introduce a straw man with this plot line, creating conflict for conflict's sake. Still, the actors and the cinematography were able to make it worthwhile.",1385424000,,606,5.1938775510204085

movies in the past two years. I doubt Mr. Elba will  be doing another Luther anytime soon. Hopefully, Neil Cross (series creator and writer) and the BBC can get Mr. Elba do one more Luther  for us. Just to give us closure.

LUTHER #3

Luther continues using his own police style to catch the criminals as seen on the first two episodes of this series.
Luther #3 starts off with internal issues in the department. There's a criminal and crimes that need to be addressed and resolved. Luther finds a new love interest; Alice is back! In watching this episode there was a painful loss I didn't see coming at all. The end of this story produced an expected denouement .While at the  same time I wondered if it WAS the right ending.

5713122,5,B00CBMWLU2,"What a treat to have another great season of ""Luther"".  Season Three (3) of this superbly directed, acted and written British detective series is so very good that I just loved it.  I adored Seasons One (1) and two (2) so very much never expecting a Season Three (3) BUT here it is and it's sublime.  Of course, this season is very well written with great British murder/mysteries for the very intense and wonderful British detective Luther to ""get to the bottom of"".  Idris Elba as ""hunky"" detective John Luther is simply brilliant being so very tough but so very vulnerable and having a very ""good"" heart--I admired him so much in Season Three (3) and I am so very glad that Mr. Elba is receiving the recognition  he so richly deserves--I am a great fan of his.  Elba brings superb acting to his role of Luther (as previously) in Season Three (3)--my god, he's so very good!  YES, Luther's nemesis Alice (fabulously and frightenly acted by Ruth Wilson) is back with her crazy self to torture Luther--the scenes between Alice and Luther set the screen on fire.  As a previous reviewer so succinctly phrased it: Ruth Wilson, as Alice, certainly ""nails"" it. She makes a ""breathtaking"" entrance and begins to dominate the screen and proceedings from that point on--Brava!!!

In Season Three (3), Luther not only has crimes to deal with but has ""Internal "" tensions/investigations to deal with along with those intent on ""getting him"".  As is obvious, I adored Season Three (3) and hope for more seasons

(I must give special mention that the direction of these episodes in Season 3 is outstanding.  There are scenes that ""scared the pants"" off me!!)",1382745600,,1647,4.7403508771929825

Very Shady characters mix with very earnest motives, combined with (by any means necessary) tactics that touches a part of you that wish you could act at times in your own life in this manner.

  If you stumble on this first, go back and see the prior episodes first, then dig in for a different view of London, and a return of the semi-unarmed police, the passion of Luther for his work, and, behind the scenes, fabulous writting and camera skills.

In fact, the whole ensemble cast is exceptionally good. This is not a formulaic crime drama.  There are no cliches or stock characters to be found.  Rather, it is creative, fresh, and edgy.

5713146,4,B00CBMWLU2,"I love this show and I plug it all time. However this season the revolving plotline about the other cops who are trying to pin some murders on Luther has gotten ridiculous. It doesn't make sense and it makes the show seem unrealistic. Also I can't imagine there are this many serial killers in London. I get so scared when I watch this show and I am home alone o.m.g. They should just cut the number of crazy plot twists. The show would be way better if they just stretched the stories out a little. It seems like they packed an entire season into 4 shows, which by the way is totally lame. I think Luther must live in hell with the bad luck this man.",1381363200,,651,4.174603174603175

5713152,4,B00CBMWLU2,"I enjoyed this series mainly because I like the Actor who plays DCI Luther. I also like how the Character (Luther)helps others , he is loyal, he fights to keep some sense of balance of justice while trying to stick to the rules. He does all with great conflict since sometimes has to bend the rules in order to save someone's life. He values those victimized by others. He is tough, doesn't get intimidated and is extremely clever.
One thing about the show is that I feel people in London should get ""peep holes"" really they just open there doors to anyone. I live in NY would never even answer the door unless your expected. Last season when the former abused hooker opens the door to the bad cop I cringed...come on could she not figure out that Luther would have his own key...really it drives me crazy when they just mindlessly open the door whenever someone knocks on it. They taught me that like when I was toddler in NY....look through peep hole if your expecting someone...if your not do not even answer the door. Sorry just one rant I have about the show lol...other then that I have enjoyed watching Luther and even have felt sad for all his losses....Too short a series :(",1380844800,,1183,4.481481481481482

5713156,5,B00CBMWLU2,The series continues to grab viewers attention. Although Season 3 starts slow it continues to be a great show. Luther is the best crime mystery show produced. I can't wait until it comes to the big screen.,1380672000,,205,4.5675675675675675

5713158,2,B00CBMWLU2,"I have a long list of specifics about what is wrong with season 3 of Luther but I'll force myself to be vague as to not spoil it for anyone who decides to watch it anyway.  Seasons 1 & 2 portrayed an antihero/superhero cop who was interesting enough to make it worthwhile to ignore the lack of situational realism that all too frequently cropped up.  Season 3 embraces all the negative aspects of the first two seasons, magnifying them immensely, resulting in a third series that is just too irrational to take seriously.  Scenarios are just laughably implausible.  Additionally, the show tries to teach some moral lessons that are so questionable that I often found myself rooting against the hero.  Seasons 1 & 2 were flawed but interesting.  Season 3 insults your intelligence.  There are only four episodes so I'm sure fans of the first two seasons will indulge - just be prepared for a disappointment.",1380585600,5,906,4.769230769230769

5713161,3,B00CBMWLU2,"I loved seasons one and two and could not wait to watch season three. After having done so and recovered from the shock, I can honestly say I don't understand what the creators were thinking in having the characters make the choices they made. And the women, this season, were just two-dimensional victims for the most part. I'd probably re-watch seasons one and two but, sadly, not this one.",1380499200,5,392,4.695652173913044
5713162,5,B00CBMWLU2,Love love love this show but four shows is a little less than I would like to see for a season of such a great show.  The time between the seasons was too long.... but this is still probably one of the greatest series on television.  Thanks.,1380499200,,241,4.1063829787234045
5713163,4,B00CBMWLU2,"I think Luther has gone through some changes for this third season.  It's still very well written with a group of terrific actors. But I found the episodes to be not as edgy as the previous 2 seasons. The storytelling style is different, slightly more similar to other crime/detective TV shows. I consider this season the ""Terminator 2"" season for Luther.  Luther turns from a good cop/detective willing to do occasional bad things, to get ""just"" or morally correct results -- into a good detective who gets the job done. This isn't a bad thing, completely. It's just a bit more of a watered down Luther than I'm used to.
It may come from the fact that Idris Alba is now working with/for Disney/Marvel, and must become more of a heroic character actor than before. Still, Alba is a great actor in any role.",1380412800,,806,4.590277777777778

5713166,3,B00CBMWLU2,"The previous two seasons were better.  The problem with this season is that the core storyline just didn't make sense, with Luther being harassed by his own police force with no real evidence.

5713167,4,B00CBMWLU2,"The Brits are delusional in their pricing - $30 (street) for 240 minutes of programming - the equivalent of about five 50 minute episodes of an American cable drama - $6 per episode.  The best American cable series have a street price of around $35 for 11 episodes - about half the price per episode.

It's not just Luther.  Check the prices for Inspector Morse and other series.  The only exception seems to be the older dramas from the BBC vault, which are much more reasonably priced - especially when Costco or Amazon has them on sale.

That's why we borrowed Luther Series 3 from the library. Great stuff, particularly the third and fourth episodes. Alice rocks!

Just watched the fourth episode again - it's genius.",1380326400,,721,4.682539682539683
5713168,5,B00CBMWLU2,"I debated giving this season 4 stars instead of 5.  The first two seasons are a solid 5 stars but, this one got off to a slow start for me.  It redeems itself when Alice Morgan comes back in 3rd episode and the whole thing just comes together there, for me.

I was sorry to know that this is the last season of the TV show that they plan to produce.  But, apparently, this is going to be spun off into a movie which will wrap up any loose threads (like Firefly, I guess).  I was VERY HAPPY to know that the Alice Morgan character is supposed to get her own series after this.  Count me in.",1380326400,,589,3.9914529914529915

(Mind you, his character 'Stringer Bell' in The Wire was compelling enough, but it's his Luther that sealed the deal.) However, it's not just his good looks and swagger that keep me engaged; the writing is outstanding, digging deep into each character and really bringing them to life (Alice Morgan for example is phenomenal as the brilliant and sociopathic nemesis/friend). And I appreciate that the story lines are not wrapped up in a tidy little package at the end of each episode, yet, play more like a mini-series throughout the season, granting the time to develop long lasting relationships with each character. Season three did not disappoint, and I do hope that they continue this show going with a season 4.",1380153600,,816,4.877697841726619

5713173,3,B00CBMWLU2,"I thought season 3 was a rung below the first two excellent seasons of 'Luther'. The writing wasn't as compelling, nor were the villains  this time around. On the bright side, the final did seem to indicate closure for the show, which was positive because I'm not sure where they would take the character in a fourth season and it would likely only tarnish the show's reputation. Seasons 1 and 2 are both very good, however.",1380067200,,424,4.578947368421052

I was really looking forward to Season 3.  Unfortunately, I cannot say that I enjoyed this season as much as the other two.  First off, the relationship with the blond woman just seemed forced.  The two actors didn't really have any chemistry.  Second, her character just wasn't interesting or compelling.  I didn't care about her at all.  I think it would have been way more interesting to have kept Luther's wife alive.  Third, I liked seeing Alice again but the way she came back out of the blue was kind of random.

5713230,5,B00CBMWLU2,"I looked at the few reviews of Season 3 that are posted here as I write this and most seem to complain that the ""Season"" is too short. I'll agree that I can't get enough of this British crime series but what we have here is a mini-series which follows a story arc. These mini-series (the BBC does quite a few that run four to 6 hours) are self-contained. And it just means that they can make more seasons. With that said...

If you have not seen Luther 1, I'll suggest starting there and moving forward. You'll watch the character grow. I won't discuss the plot - actually it's irrelevant as you are here to watch the title character, not to solve the crime. If you want that - and realize there will be ""spoilers"" - then read the other reviews here.

The US DVD release is apparently the original uncut British series as each episode runs 60 to 61 minutes and, honestly - is quite brutally graphic at times (no that's not a ""spoiler""; just an alert). There is one ""bonus"": A 12 minute ""Making of"" which focuses on Season 3 and includes comments from the cast and production team. Not essential but, still, a bonus.

I'll now await Luther 4, and maybe Luther5,6,7........

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5713236,4,B00CBMWLU2,"this series is a little more histrionic than the last ones. With a strange off the books investigation of LUTHER. that wasn't needed, but it does add drama,
However it's a good series. Luther is a beloved police character and I love him too. Idris Alba is a outstanding actor and the supporting cast is great too. However this series has too  much of bad guys going after luther etc.  And the vigilante character is more intent on going after luther than killing criminals. That adds drama for sure and luther is really more of a drama than a police show. It's a good drama though and I hope there's a fourth season.  typically the bbc only did a very short series.  It makes no sense but that's the way the bbc is.  At least they gave us ten episodes of copper!.",1378598400,,763,4.345070422535211

5713241,4,B00CBMWLU2,"I LOVE this show.  But the second and third seasons were appreciably shorter than the first.  And the shorter the seasons, the more the writers seemed inclined to pack into each episode.  The more overpacked the episodes, the sloppier, the less appealing, and the less engrossing the show became.

This last four episode season was absurdly overpacked.  This meant summary character development.  This meant borderline implausible twists.  This meant that the detective work dedicated to capturing the killer suffered.  [In fact, there was really little to no actual detective work applied to home-in on the vigilante.]  The first season was packed with great and telling flashes of John Luther's personal life -- those flashes raised the stakes when the personal and professional overlapped.  Here, Mary -- the entire sum of Luther's personal life this season -- was nothing more than a throw-in.  We knew next to nothing about her, beyond the fact that Mary was cute, smart, had a job, and was smitten with Luther.  If we had been able to see more of her, then maybe we would have cared more when Mary ended up in trouble.  But I admit I am most displeased with the Ripley arc.  I thought he grew over the second season and was becoming a great show focus in his own right.  But he was utterly wasted in the third season.  [The very idea that those other two cops could so easily put him in any kind of bind reduced Ripley's character to a mere cipher.]

And Alice Morgan.  [Sigh.]  I really wish they had done better by her incredible character than use her as a deux ex machina in the very last act.  I would have liked to see a return to the jousting between Alice and John that made Season 1 so intriguing.  Instead, Alice just happens to creep in just when she's needed.  And when she arrives, Alice -- with little digging -- simply lays bare all her motivations.  Which was entirely out of character, but necessary as they waited until the eleventh hour to re-introduce her.  Ugh.

I still LOVE this show.  [Double sigh.]  Hat's off to Idris Elba and Ruth Wilson.  They are beyond fantastic.  If there is ever another season, then please let there be:  (1) a reasonable number of episodes to allow developed content; and (b) a lot more of Luther (his struggles of conscience, the emotional impacts his job had on himself, his friends, and his loved ones) and Morgan (the cold observer, the careful catalyst, the lever against John's fulcrum) in each and every episode.",1378512000,43,2476,4.690697674418605

Neil Cross you're the greatest. What a character...Luther; no words can describe.  You can't put this masterpiece of a man on the shelf after Season 3 and the movie! Do something!!! We are addicted and dying for quality actors/writers/story lines. Don't leave us this way :( I still watch Seasons 1 & 2 and several of my friends are addicted as well.

5713247,5,B00CBMWLU2,"""Luther"" --- Why can't U.S. TV studios make something like this? I discovered this late in the game after I got DirecTV and was able to watch the BBC America channel. I guess it's too intelligent for most American viewers, as it requires the attention span of more than a gnat which is far above the 18-31 aged viewer they so desire. That said, this show needs to be a FULL run of 16 to 20 episodes per ""season"", not the teasers we're getting. Pay Mr. Elba whatever he wants --- just keep ""Luther"" on the case!",1377993600,44,510,4.268041237113402
5713248,5,B00CBMWLU2,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:

4-episode (3-storylines/2-cases) season.

The overriding theme of Series 3 being an Internal Affairs investigation of Luther. The 2-cases involve a serial killer cum woman's shoe thief and a vigilante.

Apparently, the inspiration for Luther came from both ""Sherlock Holmes"" and ""Columbo"".  While I don't see all that much of ""Holmes"", I came up with ""Luther"" as ""Columbo 2.0"" on my own.

As an American watching ""Luther"", I found myself frequently screaming at the TV, ""where is your gun!""  There was also a dramatic scene where even though I knew it was coming, it still provided my with a jolt that my wife commented on the next morning!  So what pushes ""Luther"" over the top from 4* territory to 5*?  Namely, as intriguing a character as there is on television, the deliciously psychotic Alice Morgan, played brilliantly by Ruth Wilson.  Alice, a recurring character from past series, made a surprise entrance in episode 4, which pushed the series as a whole into 5*.  I hear that there is talk of a spin-off.....

Amazon UK has a great package price for Series 1-3 (all-in 14-episodes).  As I stated in previous reviews, a region free DVD player will pay for itself with the savings on a few purchases by virtue of the Amazon/Amazon UK pricing differential (even factoring in shipping).",1376784000,34,1313,4.918181818181818
