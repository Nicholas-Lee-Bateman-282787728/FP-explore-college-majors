1022009,4,6305412820,"I think I liked ""Raining Stones"" better, but this movie captured me mainly because of its strong script and magnificent acting (Wow! for Peter Mullan). The critics who stuffed the VideoHound movie guide with  their babble only attributed two of their ""bones"" to this film.  And they seem to be a little uneasy with the ""difficult"" Scottish  accent. A little racist there? Get a grip folks, and, make an effort to  watch and review a movie that could expand your minds. Don't stop, Ken!",950227200,3,485,4.738095238095238
1022010,5,6305412820,"Ken Loach has done it again.  This uncompromising story of an out-of-work alcoholic in Glasgow combines all the best elements of Loach's previous work (Raining Stones, Ladybird, Ladybird): social realism, intense,  immediate acting, naturalistic cinematography by the great Barry Ackroyd.  Peter Mullan is magnificent as the hapless wanna-be-good Joe, juggling his  flirtations with Sarah (Louise Goodal) with his desire to help his friend  Liam (David McKay) get out of his problems with the local drug dealer.  Some American critics took issue with the film's major dramatic turn, as  Joe, trying to fix things for Liam, opts to work for Glasgow's major drug  dealer.  Stupid.  Just stupid.  The film climactic final moments are the  best half hour of sustained drama that I have ever seen.  Ken Loach, here  in his later years, is still at the top of his form, proving that he's not  gone the namby-pamby way of some other British directors.  Recommended  without reservation.",926812800,10,979,5.212903225806452
1022170,5,6305412820,"wow, am i surprised to find this movie on here.  no one knows about this movie (at least in america).  it's set in scotland and i think it has subtitles even though the characters speak english, so you can understand what they're saying.  this movie is totally amazing.  i'll never forget it.  it's probably the most real romance i've ever seen..  the guy is a charming, poor, recovering addict who falls in love with an ordinary, caring social worker.  but there's a problem.. joe needs money, and he can get it from his ex-dealer.  to get it, he'll have to do just one drug deal...  but is it that simple?  and how does it affect his romance with his new love?  this movie is so touching and not the gushy romantic garbage you're likely to find at the theater.  yes you might have to buy it on VHS instead of DVD, but buy it anyway.  it might be a movie you'll never forget.",1151539200,2,876,4.300613496932515
1022171,5,6305412820,"Contrary to the right-wing crap espoused in the Houston, TX review, this work underscores the very raison d'etre of a Loach film - good, solid, honorable, decent working-class lives, brutalized by the horrors of international capitalism - the horrific choices they face each day, in pursuit of food, shelter, companionship and self-respect, and the oft tragic costs meted out to them, for these basic necessities of every-day life. If you come out of the theater having witnessed a Loach film, and still hold any fond thoughts for Reagan, Thatcher or Bush, you weren't watching the screen ! Excellent, hard-wrought movie ...again...and again...",1123372800,9,644,5.323529411764706
1022172,5,6305412820,"Pain. Redemption. Addiction. Sacrifice. Recovery. Death. Money. Life. Sex. Love. Rage. Unemployment. Crime. Honor.
This film has it all, one of the most powerful stories I've ever seen with ""real"" people, not stereotypical cutouts so beloved by lazy filmmakers and studio suits. The story chronicles the struggles of ""Joe,"" a recovering alcoholic as he attempts to crawl back out of Hell and into honesty, hope, love, honor, daylight. It's not a pretty film in the sense of being ""...and they all lived happily ever after,"" but hope shines the brighter for a darker setting. (The Scots brogue of the actors is so thick, subtitles are a necessity, not an affectation. Without them, I'd understand probably one word in 10. Maybe 20.) The film shines for never taking the easy way out, never going for that ... plastic ""feel good"" resolution, but never descending into ""more angst-ridden-than-thou,"" either.",1049932800,4,904,5.156462585034014
1022173,4,6305412820,"Cripes, but this is one bleak, beautiful movie.  Plot is a recovering Scottish alcoholic house painting soccer coach, while pursuing a budding romance with a social worker, finds himself taking on the responsibility of one of his drug-addicted soccer charges who owes money to a local gang boss.
This is drama in its highest form.  This is a movie on par with the greatest moral dramas the cinema has ever produced (On The Waterfront, The Lost Weekend, etc).
Okay, its bleak, but don't go into this expecting some utterly incomprehensible European mess -the characters in this are readily accessible blue collar `joes' with realistic problems, and when they are being good you get a warm feeling, and when they connect you want to cheer, and by golly, when they fail you are as shattered as if it was you or someone you know on the screen.  The characters do speak with a heavy Scot accent, but I really wish I could've turned the subtitles off  - I felt like somebody somewhere assumed I wouldn't understand it, and with the crutch of subtitles I really have no hope of attempting to (and they're a little distracting from the screen when perhaps they don't even need to be there).
Peter Mullan's performance as Joe was the very best of that year - how the American Academy passed over this film is God's own wonder.  It is a heartbreaking masterpiece.",1047340800,13,1353,4.69198312236287
1022174,4,6305412820,"This story clearly points out why the British Isles have economically fallen behind even Italy in gross national product. Director, Ken Loach, allows us a peek into the sad  destructive results of the socialist nanny state prevailing in the British Isles.  Joe is supposedly a sign painter who has plenty of time to coach a soccer team, but rarely  does anything to earn a living.  He knows that he will get his welfare check, and there is little reason to search for steady employment.  Joe reminds one of the comic  strip character, Andy Capp.  There is an insightful scene in the movie where Joe rages at a welfare official who has photographed him earning money under the table.  Joe is  not in the least bit apologetic for violating the rules, but instead argues that he is still entitled to his parasitical allowance!  The government owes him a living, and that's all there is to it. We meet  Joe's social worker girlfriend and soccer team buddies.  The former serves a governmental welfare agency that does its best to further a therapeutic enabling milieu.  The buddies are drug users and part time thieves.  Everyone of them is chronologically between the ages of 20 to 40, but none have any interest in  assuming adult responsibilities.
Joe is placed into an awkward predicament by one of the younger soccer team members who owes money to a local mobster.  The mob leader according to the mores of the gangland social group refuses to cut the young man any slack out of fear of losing respect with his peers.  This is where the movie truly comes alive and compels the viewer to pay full attention.  The  ultimate resolution of this crisis forces Joe to reexamine the direction of his life.  The film is something of a dark comedy.  Loach, however, has the courage not to  indulge in sentimentality.  There is no happy ending, and we sense that similar troubles await most of these people in the future.  Only Joe and his girlfriend  might possess sufficient maturity to learn from the final tragic event.  I enjoyed this modest film immensely.  Thankfully, I might add, the director added subtitles  which helped me to follow the Scottish accent.  I hope to see more of Loach's work in the future.  The reader would do well in locating a  copy of ""My Name is Joe.""",974505600,5,2274,4.695431472081219
1022175,5,6305412820,"All the reviewers here on Amazon have it right. The acting is spectacular.  It's an eerie sense that you are spying on the lives of these people. The  movie does start out on a fun theme and takes a serious turn - but that was  the point. It's a common literary/cinematic theme for a decent man to help  out a troubled friend and then set off a worse chain of events. From what  I've read about Loach, he specializes in portraying the pitfalls of the  underclass and of institutions - I am happy that he does not do it in this  film with a heavy hand or with cheap shots. This film handles it  magnificently.
Here is an interesting tidbit for you: The supporting  actress, Lorraine McIntosh is (was) a wonderful singer in a Scottish pop  band called Deacon Blue. Check them out!",961372800,7,778,4.3776223776223775
1022176,4,6305412820,"I expected this to be good. I was still surprised by how good it was. However, it's bleak, bleak, bleak. It's a black comedy in the same vein Delicatessen is a black comedy-- you'll laugh, but don't rent this on the  same day you buy a new package of razor blades. The acting is some of the  best deadpan I've seen in years, and it works-- the parallel between  Sabine, the junkie, and life in a dead Scottish town is a little too  in-the-face at times, but it's still handled with sharp-tongued wit  throughout. The camerawork is somewhat uninspiring, but we should be used  to that in things coming out of the British Isles these days. Besides, it  doesn't have to be good. The characters carry this one. But prepare to be  depressed, and you'll want to keep away from sharp objects during the last  ten minutes.",961286400,8,814,4.482993197278912
1022177,5,6305412820,"My Name is Joe is not only a realistic portrayal of everyday life but it also achieves a certain amount of optimism in the audience. The acting is superb - Mullen as Joe is fantastic and it can't be long before he begins  to take the British film scene by storm. Ken Loach's directing is not only  innovative but extremely rewarding for the viewer, and My Name is Joe  promises future success for this director. The film is a gritty,  thought-provoking drama which does not feel the need to have a  Hollywood-esque 'happy' ending. A truly enjoyable film. I would recommend  it to all.",957398400,8,584,4.5673076923076925
1022178,5,6305412820,"This is one of my favorite British films. It is about a Glaswegian man that used to be an alcholic, he coaches a soccer team, the rest you'll have to find out yourself. If you liked Trainspotting you'll love this gem. The  only thing that bugged me where the subtitles, everyone was speaking  english, there was no need for them.

1022179,5,6305412820,"An absolutely brilliant film that portrays the hardships oflife as only the British can.  It features the ""MotherSuperior"" from Trainspotting in the leading role and the rest of the cast is great too.  If you happen to see this and liked it, as I know you will, I also recommend ""The Dreamlife of Angels."" Similar tragic themes.",954979200,2,328,4.7368421052631575
7888933,1,6305412820,"As noted in other reviews, the accents are very strong, making the film unintelligible. I turned it off after 15 minutes. Seems this is often the case with Irish and Scottish films (and even some from Britain).",1517529600,,210,4.702702702702703
7888934,4,6305412820,"I love this movie -- it's such a relief to see a story about realistic people just trying to get by through their considerable troubles.  Only four stars rather than five because the low-budget filmmaking won't please everyone -- it's not a glossy, Hollywood film.  But the lead performances are deep and very appealing.  Definitely worth your time if you like character-driven pieces or are a working-class recovering alcoholic looking for a representation that rings true.",1505865600,,474,5.2105263157894735

7888938,5,6305412820,"Finally got to see this one - after having lived in and around Glasgow, for 24 years, I'm now in the USA, and I felt right at home with the chaotic ways of communication, the broad brogue, and the characters.
This is a must-see movie, even if you have to switch to subtitles (I did'nae...): the drug scene, alcoholism, and mayhem are more or less the same, wherever you live, and the human tragedy, the desperation in having to live in a jungle, are the same, all over the world. Outstanding performances by all the actors, even if the background soundtrack was a bit too much in the foreground, sometimes.
An Oscar for Peter Mullan!!!",1452988800,,635,4.530434782608696

7888940,5,6305412820,"This is a rough film...no sugar coating...gritty and as real as they come!.

Peter Mullan delivers a most riveting performance as Joe Kavanagh, a man ten months sober in AA, struggling in the welfare district of Glasgow, Scotland to survive and turn his life around. He coaches a welfare soccer team, goes to his 12-step meetings and does painting jobs on the sly in order to make ends meet. Life really takes a turn for the best when he meets social worker Sarah Downie (Louise Goodall).Their relationship is sweet and quite charming. How nice it would have been if the McGowen Boys did not rule the town and the drug trade. Joe is forced to make decisions that threaten his sobriety and his relationship with Sarah as he tries to protect his best friends from falling deeper into the world of addiction. No small wonder that Mullan took home the best actor award at Cannes in 1999 for this role. This is acting at it's most primal!

Director Ken Loach always takes on the grim realities of life in his films, and MY NAME IS JOE is not for the faint at heart. Loach exposes Scotland in it's poverty, crime and underworld drug trade through the eyes of a man who is in much need of his own recovery. Loach examines the difficulties that confront those trying to heal from substance abuse in a place where temptation and thugs exist around every corner to thwart the addict's recovery. Loach has one very interesting scene where tourists are seen taking their pictures with a bagpiper who "" only knows three songs."" Joe remarks ""Ah, good ol' Bonnie Scotland!"" showing the stark contrast in which outsiders see Scotland as opposed to the problems that it really has.

This film is RAW and has extremely coarse language throughout. There is a lot of explosive emotion. This film, though ,is not without it's very tender side. Definitely adult content, MY NAME IS JOE is excellent for understanding the ups and downs of addiction and highlights absolutely some of the finest acting that you will ever see. In English, with subtitles provided in order to maneuver the thick Scottish accents!

A good companion film would be CLEAN AND SOBER , 28 DAYS (Sandra Bullock Version), and MARIA FULL OF GRACE.",1191456000,6,2195,4.693506493506494

MY NAME IS JOE deals with one of Ken Loach's favorite themes: if something must change socially or politically in a given situation, it's only by means of a collective action that things will evolve. Even if Joe Kavanagh manages, for a moment, to help juvenile delinquents around him, he won't be able to eradicate by himself the London underworld. Ken Loach's cinema is terribly pessimistic but, in its small way, it could multiply its seeds and wake in the audience the desire to live in a better world.
