7876770,3,6304673825,"I purchased this set for one reason. I enjoy the occasional Saturday afternoon early Western, and I wanted my children to share that with me. John Wayne did this with the best of them. You remember that kind of movie, where the plots were simple, the bullets endless and hats never fell off (even in fights)?
Sure the film is grainy and the sound scratchy; all the easier to recapture the feel of the old Bijou Theater(s) sprinkled across the MidWest.
These movies provide an hour's respite from today's tragic world, offering instead guys in white saving the ranch in the nick of time from guys in black. Butter some popcorn, pop a Pepsi, sit back and enjoy becoming simple for an hour. The world's problems can wait.",1064448000,4,718,4.6171875
