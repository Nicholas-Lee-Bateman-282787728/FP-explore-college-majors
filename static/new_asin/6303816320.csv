724567,4,6303816320,The Gift of Winter is delightful.  My 3 and 5 yr old grandones loved it. An unexpected pleasure was the half rather antique cartoons that followed. There is one about a Norwegian troll that is delightful.,1390176000,2,204,4.666666666666667
724568,5,6303816320,"A unique precursor to Witch's Night Out, this has the voice talents of Gilda Radner and Dan Aykroyd. Somewhat archaic and clunky animation, but fun to watch.  Also includes bonus cartoons that put you in the spirit of Christmas. Have a look if you want to enjoy versatile voice acting from these actors.",1347408000,,303,4.716981132075472
724569,5,6303816320,"One of the curious aspects of this particular piece is the fact that ALL the sound effects in the mini-movie are voice acted.  The sound of a door closing loudly is actually someone saying ""Slam!""  When the children are trying to catch up to the adults, the noise their feet make is ""trudge, trudge"" in the children's voices.  It would be annoying if a series was like this, but in this particular piece, it's creative and charming, kind of like reading a comic book (Where a punch is ""Blam!"").  The voices may annoy some viewers, they are corny.  The story is short, it's nice, but not super deep or preachy. Christmas is mentioned, but it's a non-religious piece if that matters to anyone.  My particular copy seems a bit shaky when watched...but I think this is something pretty obscure, probably recorded from an old VHS originally.  The DVD cover art does not greatly resemble the actual animation.  It's an inexpensive, fun, and short low-budget cartoon with it's own unique charm.",1303948800,2,987,4.764705882352941
724570,5,6303816320,It was funny when I was 16 and is still funny at 32. Has many celebrity comic voices and shows some of their comic genius.  A classic!!,1240358400,,135,4.0
724571,2,6303816320,"I got this for a few reasons.  Dan Akroyd does a voice, its from the 70s and I had never heard of it before.  I would tell you what it is about but I really am not sure.  The reason is because you can hardly understand the voices at all.  Seriously it is almost impossible to understand half of what they are saying.  I mean I paid less than 2 dollars for it.  So it's fine with me.  I am also keeping it because of the reasons I got it.  But it's hard to give it a better raiting.

There are some ld cartoons on after the main one though.  Which adds to the experience.  You can understand the other cartoons well.",1233360000,,615,3.959016393442623
724572,3,6303816320,"This is a true case of ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"", or in this case, the VHS.  This particular cover illustration is a million times prettier than the actual movie, with jerky animation and an elementary school art style.  The story is short and quite sweet, however, and the cheese actually adds to its appeal.  It's fun to watch the wonky, quirky characters on their journey with the voices of Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner.  Despite its faults, this little flick might just grow on you.  (I'm still throwing around the line, ""You're a sugar, Maple!"", courtesy of the two rather ""fabulous"" talking trees.)",1198108800,,613,4.745283018867925

7854743,4,6303816320,"Not exactly a venerated classic like the Holy Trinity of Yuletide animation (Charlie Brown Grinch, Rudolph), but a quirky and unpretentious tale of how snow, oddly enough, put warmth into the winter season. Animation Scrooges may grumble about the lack of in-betweens which make the characters' movements herky-jerky, and the visible construction lines typical of the Xerography era, but there should only be this much charm in contemporary CGI animation. (Bazooey wouldn't have the same pizazz in digital 3D.) Speaking of the character design, it clearly influenced cartoonist Cathy Guisewite, whose eponymous character--who premiered in 1976, two years after this--looked an awful lot like ""Tender"" in the strip's early years. But why did Dan Aykroyd make the trees gay?",1513728000,,772,5.495798319327731

7854745,3,6303816320,"Bought this because we loved ""Witches Night Out"". This is only fair, was expecting better.",1480982400,,90,5.066666666666666
7854746,5,6303816320,"The Gift of Winter is the mysterious prequel to Witch's Night Out, and though you can tell this was an early animation version, the characters remain practically the same from the Halloween Special itself.  Originally developed as a pilot for PBS about how things came to be, the Gift of Winter was produced in Canada, and was created by the same animators who made some shorts for Sesame Street.

The late Gilda Radner narrates the tale (not to mention playing some of the characters as well) about how once Winter had no snow, and we're introduced to the characters of Small, Tender, Goodly, Nicely, Malicious, Rotten and Bazooey.  Basically the story is about how they decide to go to the Ministry of Winter to protest the desolate conditions the Season brings, in hopes of making it better, or at least more enjoyable.

What's interesting about this short is the fact, though it was done on a low-budget, the animated tale does have its charm.  For instance, the sound effects are genuinely spoken than just imitated.  Also are some hilarious moments, like when Goodly and Nicely attempt to do a romantic scene, where Malicious interrupts by proclaiming, ""They make me sick!""

The tale is great for the fact the plot is simple and not so preachy, though I will warn some parents of today, there is one scene you make not like, and that's where Rotten and Malicious secretly plan to blow up the Ministry with dynamite.  But you have to remember, this special was produced back in the 70s, where stuff like that was kind of the standard for cartoons.  Other than that, it does have a bit of a moralistic message where Bazooey explains to Small and Tender why Winter seems so mean, but in a way can't really help it.

Which is interesting since I can recall most animations of the time, you rarely see the heroes solve the problem though frank discussion.  What makes this film really enjoyable is the way the characters interact with one another, with a fun ending to it.  I would recommend adding the Gift of Winter as a Holiday Classic along with the standards like 'A Charlie Brown Christmas.' Since it does send a fun message without being incessantly preachy or sappy.  Definitely an interesting purchase!",1479254400,2,2212,4.729166666666667
