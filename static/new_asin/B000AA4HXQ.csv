8443698,5,B000AA4HXQ,"""Postcards from Buster"" is out on DVD and unlike most of the ""Arthur"" DVD releases, they're really on the ball with this. This DVD contains four complete episodes of the show as well as some great special features.

""Postcards from Buster"" features live-action and animation. It shows the character Buster, from the hit series ""Arthur,"" visiting real kids.

The episodes on this DVD all have a musical theme. Buster visits San Francisco, San Antonio, New Orleans and Leiper's Fork/Nashville on this DVD. He meets kids who do hip-hop, kids who play musical instruments, records a song at a recording studio and much more. The episodes are packed with fun music, interesting kids and neat animation.

This DVD has two great special features --- Drawing with Marc Brown and a series overview for Parents and Educators. The Drawing segments feature Marc Brown himself teaching how to draw the characters Arthur, D.W., Buster, Pal and Baby Kate. This is a good segment and just by following along, you'll be able to draw these characters too! The series overview is excellent. It features actual segments from Marc Brown and executive producer Carol Greenwald, among others, talking about the rationale behind the series. Viewers will learn how it supports learning of the English language and plans for the overall educational outreach. There are also promos/trailers for ""Spongebob Squarepants,"" ""Rugrats"" and ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.""",1135987200,4,1457,5.244635193133047

Not only do kids get to meet some little girls who are great dancers in San Francisco, but you'll meet an accoridian virtuoso from San Antonio.  There are 2 other great stories and all are ethinically and locationally diverse and interesting, interesting enough for parents to find themselves watching along with the kids.  The music is cute and catchy, and the characters are extremely likeable.  Don't cheap out and get the video as you only get 2 episodes as opposed to the 4 on the DVD!",1131580800,,558,4.606060606060606
