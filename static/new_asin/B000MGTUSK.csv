2735229,3,B000MGTUSK,"Deadlands: The Rising (Gary Ugarek, 2006)

Gary Ugarek's microbudget zombie flick Deadlands has received almost universal scorn since its release three years ago. While I guess I can understand why, given that most people don't watch nearly as many microbudget horror movies as I do, I have to be the voice of dissent on this one. While its harsher critics are certainly accurate in their assessments of the movie's amateur feel, both in the acting and in the technical details, and the slowness of the thing to get anywhere, I didn't think either of these shortcomings outweighed the surprisingly realistic feel or the solid script.

Plot: two guys, Dave (Dave Cooperman) and Gary (Gary Ugarek), find themselves in the middle of a zombie invasion after a military experiment gone horribly wrong. Yeah, that's pretty much it. And I should mention, since this seems to be one of the bones of contention among the movie's many, many critics, that the actual zombie invasion doesn't really take place until the final half of the movie. There's quite a bit of character setup and the like for a movie that runs shy of eighty minutes.

Because of this, a lot of how you feel about the movie is probably going to be based on whether you're expecting Hollywood-quality acting from a next-to-zero-budget movie. If you are, you're looking in the wrong place. I've seen a few microbudget horror films with incredible acting, but in general, they're indie flicks that got Hollywood actors who were willing to work for very little because they believed in the project (Deadbirds and Shallow Ground being obvious examples). This is way, way more indie than that; it's a bunch of guys with a camcorder who decided they wanted to make a zombie movie. Of the main cast in the film, three had worked in font of a camera before at all, and of the three, only one was appearing in more than his second film (Cooperman, who mostly works as a TV character actor). We're not talking about a cast where a casting director made a couple of agent calls and everyone was lined up. This is friends, family, etc. If you're not willing to take it as it was intended, then do yourself a favor and pass this one up entirely; you have to go into this one expecting it to be substandard in pretty much every way. If you do that--take it for what it actually is and evaluate it in that vein--Deadlands: The Rising is, dare I say it about a movie so universally loathed?, an above-average example of the microbudget-zombie subgenre. Why? For the exact reason everyone seems to hate it--because it takes the time to build the characters, and it allowed the actors a great deal of leeway in doing so, from what I understand (a good deal of the dialogue, especially between Dave and Gary, was supposedly improvised). Like all good zombie films, this one is a lot less about the zombies themselves than it is about the people who are confronted with the zombies. And in that vein, I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, any microbudget horror flick I've seen in the past year. ***",1238371200,2,3045,4.656133828996283
2735230,3,B000MGTUSK,"In my opinion, the latest living dead movie to beat is ""The Zombie Diaries."" And that is not because Zombie Diaries is a good movie.. it's actually one of the worst hunks of crap ever made, even though some hype it up. So how does Deadlands stack up against the Bowel movement of the year in Z.D????? Deadlands is one of those low budget movies that is a few steps above the ultra cheesy cam-corder look. The dialogue can be a bit corny in parts, and the the movie can be humourous in spots.. (especially those few zombies wearing glasses.)The acting is by no means first class, the script needed work.. BUT... there were a few good scenes that worked out pretty well for what the budget had. It was kind of a fun watch all things being considered. Some of the zombies looked okay and the movie had it's own little atmosphere. So was it a great movie??? No.. but even this low budget special beat the pants off of Zombie Diaries. For that, and for being a fun and sometimes funny watch.. 3 stars.",1235433600,,996,4.360215053763441

This was probably done over a couple of days with a digital camcorder by about a dozen people with a very slim idea of what plot means and what special effects look like.  The worst movie I have ever seen.  I have seen home movies and slide shows that had better pacing and that built better suspense.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!  Run from this dog of a pretend film.",1220313600,3,508,3.98019801980198
2735232,2,B000MGTUSK,"Well...here's goes...

1) ACTING: Not bad; typical for low budget fare. Some are good, some are bad, some are REALLY bad, the usual. Again, some of the lines that the actors had were a little tough, and I wonder if even the best of master thespians could have pulled those lines off. While it is nice to see ""everyday people"" in a movie, Hollywood has almost demanded that the main heroes are ""pretty people.""

2) PRODUCTION: Again, not too bad. I enjoyed the scene where all the cars are backed up in traffic and the zombies attack. Nicely done; very apocolyptic. Some minor lighting issues (one dark scene had the ""Gary"" character talking to someone, and only Gary's ear was in the light...unintentional humor). The blood and gore wasn't all that bad...for what there was of it. One continuity goof that REALLY stuck out was the Conner's dog. It is written into the script, the scene where Conner's mom goes upstairs to get the dog. She comes back downstairs with the dog and...that's it. Conner and his mom leave the house, seconds later, and the dog is nowhere to be seen. This little slip ruined the next scene for me where Conner's mom finds the cop dead after being attacked by zombies. I was so distracted by the missing dog, I had to hit reverse on the DVD player to see if I missed anything. There was also a lot of slow-motion shots used in the movie that I really didn't understand why. And the ending was rather abrupt. I wasn't even sure the movie was over until the credits began to roll. Of all that I seen, I think the biggest problem was the script. Minimal action for the first 30 minutes or so caused my mind to wander. I know that plotlines need to be set up to be put in motion, but perhaps they could've been woven into some action to get us to the second part of the movie when the zombies attack and the action really starts. In my opinion, I believe that this movie could have been better, if the director was not part of the acting ensemble. I think that way he could've focused more on the script, the filming, and the budget, tightening things up.

3) THE ZOMBIES: We have a mix of ""Romero shamblers"" and ""Snyder runners."" There seemed to be no ryhme or reason, as some shambling zombies would run, stalk, and attack in later scenes. Some of the zombie were almost like ninjas, as they silently would appear out of nowhere. The make up consisted of white / grey face with dark sunken eyes and minimal facial applications. Nothing really new is brought to the zombie genre in the movie as the zombie do what they do best, kill and eat.

4) THE CAUSE: While nothing solid is ever mentioned, I imagine that the zombie epidemic is related to the explosions that hit a lot of U.S. cities.

5) NUDITY: None.

First and foremost, I am NOT a movie director. I have NOT made my own film, and most likely, never will. But, as a PAYING CUSTOMER whose dollars support this film genre, I deserve the best damn product that can be made. Some of the dreck that gets put out nowadays is an insult to both me and my wallet. That said, back to my review.

I do not hate this movie. This movie is not the worst zombie movie ever made. Is it incredible? The 'Citizen Kane' of zombie movies? No. But, it is an average, passable entry into the zombie movie genre. Sadly, I think it will be dismissed as another low budget zombie flick and easily forgotten. I really believe if the script had been tighter, and if the director was not acting as well, this could've been a pretty good movie. Being a first time director / producer, hopefully the director will take notice of any problems that may have occurred and be able to correct them in his next production.

2735234,2,B000MGTUSK,"C- = A little disapointed I must say. After watching tons of zombie movies, several of them indie recently - I set a high bar for Deadlands. The expectation did not meet the result. Sorry to say.

The editing was poor. Several shots showed nothing but empty street. And showingcasing that Mustang - was boring.

The two protagonists - drew no sympathy from me. Neither did the fat mother and the child. I could not wait until they all got eaten.

The two interesting characters - survivalist gun nut brother in law, and the guy with the hat who warned the folks at the shelter - did not get enough airtime.

Gun handling was terrible in this movie. No regard for the rules of safety. And drinking while shooting. Wow. Another terrible stereotype.

The entire National guard squad - was unshaven, did not have full uniforms. One can only suspend ones disbelief for so long.

Lastly one side of the freeway is jammed with cars, yet the other side is wide open. None of the people decide to do the smart thing - turn back. Genius.

Sixty three minutes for $17.99? Not worth it. Wait until it hits the $5 bin if you really need a mediocre zombie movie.",1177632000,25,1148,4.464114832535885

2735251,1,B000MGTUSK,"Deadlands: The Rising (2006)

 This amateur film has Gary Ugarek as the director.  He appeared as a Zombei in the 2005 film Land of the Dead.  Apparently that experience led him to believe that he could make a Zombie movie.  And by golly, he did make a Zombie movie. The producers include Gary Ugarek, Brian Wright and Lisa Brandt.  Gary Ugarek wrote the screenplay (badly with stilted dialog and little action).  The cast includes Gary Ugarek, Brian Wright, Michelle Wright, and Connor Brandt.  The entire production seems to be a family affair.
 We are used to films made with very little money but this one might set a new record.  The budget estimate is just under eleven thousand dollars.  No catered canteen for the actors folks, or pay either unless I miss my guess.
 The Zombies mix us up a bit.  Usually they are traditional slow strollers with jerky action but from time to time they rush their victims quickly.  Naturally the film provides no reason for this.  The make up is acceptable with the longer term Zombies having chalk white faces under their bloody mouth parts with others have more minimalist make up.  The make up has no consistency, I just invented the rational for the white face Zombies.  Again, the film explains nothing about it.
 In the story, a terrorist attack in Baltimore, the setting, sets off a Zombie Apocalypse.  Ordinary folk are featured in the film, folk who are not particularly bright or active.  Most of the action consists of people talking to each other trying to understand whats what.  And they go from place to place, room to room with no real intent other than motion.
 Even given all the stuff that we can blame on the super low budget ie- National Guard guys who are wearing random cammo uniforms and a random assortment of weapons, acting like the actors are untrained members of the general public who must be content with a single film take due to the constraints of the cost of film, sound that is uneven and the like-the script does not compel our attention.  A brilliant script by Ugarek would have made up for the other deficiencies.  But Ugarek instead give us a coherent script (which puts it above other Zombie films) but one with no tension and little action.
 I want to speak well of this little movie but I can't.  It contains too little beside ambition (hubris?) to recommend it.  The one saw blade film I found tedious and with nothing to recommend it, even to fans.  It does show that you can make a film with almost nothing but talent.  But you must have talent.  It runs one hour and 38 minutes.  It is not rated but would be rated with an R for a few graphic gut gobbling scenes.
 Against all odds this low budget film must have made some money.  Ugarek made another ultra low budget Zombie film later on.  I can only imagine that he somehow made money on the first one to stimulate him to make the second.  It was not stimulated by favorable reviews.",1426723200,,2922,4.553846153846154

2735264,1,B000MGTUSK,"When I rented this movie, it was rated at 3.5 stars. Normally, Amazon's rating system is more accurate than Netflix's, so I figured, 'hey, must be a decent movie, anyhow.'

I'm not even sure where to begin on this movie. It is cheap, and not just 'B-movie' cheap, but watching it, you feel like you are watching your own camcorder work, in action. I am quite-confident they didn't mean to do this, like a 'Blair Witch' or anything, this was the result of doing this movie with simple over-the-counter phone cameras and camcorders.

The script drags badly. It's like watching the movie being shot in your backyard, and listening to your redneck friends all carry on, during the filming. It ambles, it is slow, REALLY SLLLLLOOOOOWWW to develop, and when they are saying something, they aren't saying much anyway.

Ok, the show is supposed to be located in Maryland, but when the zombies come out, so do the guns. I own several, and even like the 'shoot the zombies' movies, but this one is so 'in-your-face' with 'we're loaded for zombie shootin' that it's just too much. I kept thinking during the movie, 'I don't think there are that many pistols IN Maryland, due to their gun laws, anyhow. Really bad, when that catches your attention.

The zombies are mad-dash runners, and not something you see in too many movies. If anything, they are STILL the best acting in the whole movie, and almost on level with what you'd see in 'The Walking Dead - Season 1', compared to the rest of the cast, which seems like just anyone they decided to grab off the street to read a line for the show. Watch the faces in the rescue shelter, and you'll understand what I mean.

As for all the high reviews, I'm quite convinced that most of those who watched it and rated it 4-5 stars are one of the hundred-plus zombie actors in this show.

Even if you like 'B-movies', take a pass on this one, your kids could make a better film, just get them a camcorder and some greasepaint.",1363478400,13,1959,4.5354107648725215

The one big traffic jam scene was so horrible i couldn't tell which ones were the zombies or the humans. The lack of special effects/make up/costumes/acting made it impossible to tell who was who.

The only question that remained was whether or not I wanted to waste my time following the rabbit down this particular hole to see where it would end.  I opted to waste my time.  To begin with, I don't think it is even appropriate to compare a film such as Gary Ugarek's to the Romero Dead films or the 28 .... later cycle---how superior you reviewers must feel to be able to spot the flaws in an ultra-low budget film like Deadlands.  Ebert will definitely need to step his game up with you guys on the job.  So much for the apology.  Ugarek, however, gets a big high-five for casting everyday joe-blows for the leads.  Take a good look at who takes your money when you fill up your car with gas, or who serves you coffee at your favorite greasy spoon.  Believe it, these are the people who will be left standing in the advent of a zombie holocaust-not the clueless silver spoon hotties who have probably forgotten how to look after and care for themselves.  So, if the zombies move like middle-class porkers who've just put the kaibash on a lunch buffet, that's because 2/3 of America has a weight problem--don't expect Hollywood, they have better things to do than mix with the likes of us (like get eaten!).  The trade off is in the obvious flaws in the film, namely the wooden and allegedly ad-libbed acting.  As a result, just about every character is pretty much non-sympathetic.  I truly could care less if they got the chomp put on them.  In this case it certainly wouldn't have killed Ugarek to invest in a script person and possibly a couple of decent actors.  Yes, the lighting is also pretty bad.  Me, I personally had no problem with it, b/c that is really how I see at night anyhow.  The makeup wasn't bad, although the zombie actors seemed to be hamming it a little too much, except for #11 zombie-watch out for him!  The gore, what there was of it, was not bad due to some very clever camera work that didn't over focus on the carnage-you saw just enough to have it register in your mind and then it was on to something else.

8168999,2,B000MGTUSK,"Yes, its low budget. Yes, it starts like every low budget clich. Yes, it was another pre-zombie to beginning of zombie outbreak movie. The one thing I liked is the actors didn't try to be something there not. I hate when the average zombie movie maker makes actors try to be Brad Pitt, or Sam Jackson on Snakes on a Plane style. They were 2 buddies that banter like 2 friends should. The joking around and being smart a$$es to each other made me settle in to see if the story had some meat. The wife/mother waiting at home after the, yes i know, clich terrorist atack seemed real. She just listened to radio, open book shes really not reading, and trying to get thru during a sporadic cell service to her husband.  Meanwhile the average citizens are confused. Theres the dumb, dumber, and dumbest people ive ever seen in the traffic jam, and I couldn't wait to see them get eaten. Then the lame ""safe zone"" for everyone to gather. Budget really showed up there. The pathetic interpretation of national guard and citizens was laughable. But, when the story went back to the family I didn't mind it so much. The initial reveal of the zombies was alright to meh, but there was some good shots during traffic jam. I thought the side mirror slow down showing the zombies was not to shabby. There was some semblance of a eye for creativity. Then the reuniting of the family wasn't to bad, but the flash forward was lazy. Best friend worried of complacency, and the lack of supplies was classic set up. Ending.... well lets say, ""nice try"" They missed a opportunity to do something special with what worked, their natural family cohesion. Low budget, 1hr, and could be worse make up was worth the try.  I'm trying to give all the low budget zombie movies a run since I love the genre, but if you are meh to zombies pass on it.

8169000,2,B000MGTUSK,"There has been such a glut of zombie movies in the last decade that when you decide to watch one of the free ones, no matter what the source, they will not be B-movies but amateur movies. I can be pretty lenient on these because I appreciate the effort and enthusiasm of those who made it. However this movie is so ineptly made I can't say that I liked it at all. I saw it once before, too, since it's been floating around on YouTube for a number of years. I just wanted to see if it was as bad as I remembered. Guess what? Yes, that bad.

To its credit, this film was made just when the whole genre was becoming popular again: after 28 Days Later in 2002, and the Dawn of the Dead remake and Shaun of the Dead in 2004. So it's a little early, before every teenager with a digital movie camera or a smartphone started making them episodically (though those are generally better than this one. The error here was thinking too big with limited means to execute the concept. This is plotted as a full apocalyptic zombie film with big scenes before ending up in a remote country cabin. Here they tried. It has a large cast of both extra townsfolk and zombies. But its clear neither had much coaching and no one knows what they're doing. The best moment is halfway in when they actually had a street closed and set up a traffic jam-zombie attack. The time leading up to this is excruciatingly slow and involves too much of Gary Ugarek (writer, director and actor) and his friend Dave going out to drink and shoot guns. No one in the film can act and the script is uninspired and disjointed at times.

Still, they tried. Believe it or not there is a second installment, Deadlands 2:Trapped, and it's a giant step above this attempt. The director wisely does not appear in it and it takes place mostly at a multiplex theater.

8169007,2,B000MGTUSK,"If this was a first time effort by a young filmmaker I would say NOT BAD. That's why I gave it 2 stars. When you take out the very elongated credits and pauses between scenes, the movie is actually less than 1 hour. If you are expecting more than the basic DIY movie, forget it.

Now for those do-or-die zombie fans that were expecting more. I know: poor wooden acting, weak scene transition, barely believable zombies and unimaginative ending........take away another star.

Something to watch while your clipping your toenails or nose hair, or both.",1486684800,,551,4.7894736842105265
