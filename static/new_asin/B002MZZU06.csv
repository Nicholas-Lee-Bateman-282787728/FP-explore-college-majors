8374431,5,B002MZZU06,"This was very much a delightful film to watch even if, by today's standards, it is a little corney.

It was nice to see Conrad Veidt playing a good guy for once.  He always seems to land the roles where he is either the villan or some creeped out weirdo!  It was a very nice change of pace to see the character he was playing upbeat, cheerful and smiling.  Major Strasser this is not!

I really am not keen on Amazon refering to this as ""sinister cinema"".  It had its usual climatic moments of crisis as do all films, complete with a raging thunderstorm outside the house to symbolize the turmoil within, but this is not a movie meant to frighten.  At various points in the film each character faces a moment where they must choose to either move on with hope or give in to despair.  The viewer is kept on the edge of his/her seat with suspense wondering which choice each respective personna will make.  The darkest emotion evoked by this film is more one of angst than fear.

Once it is established that Conrad's Veidt's character is there to be a force for good (and this fact is quickly established), all aire of sinisterness disappears.  Once seen what The Stranger does for Vivian, the viewer drawn that much deeper into the plot waiting to see what he will do for all the rest of the lodgers.

This movie is a very good movie to view but with the caviat that, as said in other reviews, this is an old film and quality of video and audio especially will reflect that fact.  In spite of that, I would highly recommend the film to anyone.",1289692800,,1542,4.34965034965035
8374432,4,B002MZZU06,"Whether arch villian, or arch angel Veidt's performances are always so compelling.  Here, he is the mysterious good wanderer, quietly changing the lives of snobby tenants in a London boarding house.  This is an English movie and social class is a major theme.  Another fine English movie, Hobson's Choice, also deals strongly with social class.

It is a wonderful change to see Veidt as almost angelic, suffering with the other characters when he can't save them torment.  One of the boarders, however, is his opposite, viciously cultivating dissention.  It is a very interesting confrontation between the two.  The wonderful English actors struggle with the newly found visions of themselves, or really reality according to Veidt (he is not given a name).  They had been living in visions.

Its a pity more work wasn't done restoring this film.  Background noise drowns out the dialogue in places.  Also, a few times the actors talk so fast its hard to get the words.  But most of it is quite watchable.",1271376000,3,1004,4.946107784431137
