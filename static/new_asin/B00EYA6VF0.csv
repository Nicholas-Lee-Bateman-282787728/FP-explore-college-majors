5956150,4,B00EYA6VF0,"IN MY humble, unprofessional opinion each of these actresses is a star in her own right but the humor isn't as striking as in Frasier,  Golden Girls, Harry's Law and others. .I have watched all the seasons because I like each actress and I keep wanting to see the show come together humor-wise. I especially love Jane Leeves and Betty White.  But if Betty White weren't in this show, even with the other three leading ladies, I don't think it would have made it through the first season. To me, the writing just isn't there.  But I'm very glad the show is experiencing as much success as it is, for the sake of everyone involved in it.  I am JUST a viewer and a fan of the four stars, obviously, not a professional anything. This is just my response to the show.",1417478400,,762,4.345070422535211

5956191,5,B00EYA6VF0,"Very funny, the best part is you can start from any season because they bring you up to speed on the first episode.  Nothing is too much for them, it's kind of like a modern Golden Girls.  Love it, this show is one of my top shows!",1392595200,,231,3.893617021276596

Yet each DVD cuts out out half way through most of the episodes and moves to the start of the next episode.  None of my other Region One DVDs suffer in this way.

5956197,5,B00EYA6VF0,"What's not to love about a sitcom with Betty White? The story is surprising, even in season 4, the girls are charming and the characters get clearer and mor substantial. I ordered all the DVDs to Germany because we don't get them here which is a shame! Maybe after another year they will discover this sitcom and also show it in Germany (hopefully!).",1389657600,,350,4.571428571428571

5956200,5,B00EYA6VF0,"I'm a big fan of Jane Leeves, but have discovered a brilliant comedic cast in Hot in Cleveland! As Hot in Cleveland does not air in Australia, purchasing the series is my only option. It is a hilarious program, that allows us to see a little of our own idiosyncrasies in others. Laughter is the best medicine.",1389052800,3,309,4.43859649122807

5956207,5,B00EYA6VF0,"Hot In Cleveland has definitely hit its stride during its 4th season. Along with some fantastic guest stars visiting nearly every week, the scripts are stronger, funnier and more creative than ever. While I appreciate TV Land carrying this show, it deserves getting a wider audience on a major network. Kudos to the cast and staff of Hot In Cleveland! Thanks for the great season! Looking forward to Season 5!",1385251200,6,409,4.857142857142857
