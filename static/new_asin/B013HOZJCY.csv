7365068,3,B013HOZJCY,"I am an older-school fan of Leslie's, in my early 30s, and one that has until recently collected all of Leslie's workouts (post VHS). I am not feeling these newer releases, as in, the post-gym ownership workouts.

The angles in this workout and most of the newer ones along with some of the cast having mics as well as the overall production and vibe leave it feeling like a blast from the past in a not so good way. I was never a fan of Crunch Fitness. I didn't like the jostling of the camera, people being mic'd, the banter and scripted expressions, along with the ""whooping"" and overly enthusiastic shouts. I don't understand why Leslie has taken this new approach except to perhaps draw a new generation into her workouts. Ok, good business model I suppose, but these are lacking what so many of us long-time fans have been drawn to: The warmth, personality (genuine), familiar friends and family of Leslie's, the people that you walked with over the years and got to know them not only through the workouts, but also on her old forums; you got to know the back stories. It wasn't about color splashes and what's fashionable, it was about working out to honor the ""temple"" that God gave you. ""Come as you are"" was the style and approach, her workouts would meet you where you stood, literally and spiritually. Now it's phony, let's pretend this workout is hard and sweaty. It's obvious with the shape of the cast these are not the typical Leslie-walkers. Let's make comment about sweat and being out of breath when you can see plain as day, that's not the case. God has been removed, grace is no longer something she shares without fear, it's totally bland and secular.

What happened to Carol and Mary Kay? Cheryl? What happened to Leslie wanting to really connect with her audience? She's still charming and sweet, that is something I cannot deny. However, it's different. She's not as relaxed and with all the makeup and fashion, lack of Spirit, she's not her old self. She's gorgeous, yes, but not the ""light"" she was. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's taking her in a direction that she wasn't going and fitting her into a Hollywood-fitness mold that she was doing so well without.

The workout is true to the cover. You'll get exactly what is advertised which is why I gave it 3 stars. I took 2 away because Leslie's workouts have lost something very special that long-time users have loved and enjoyed for decades. It wasn't broke and didn't need to be fixed. A few new moves, a couple of new tunes, and perhaps a workout here and there filmed outdoors, sure, variety!. I'd rather workout with her sans cast and crew than with these newer faces and new style. It's Crunch meets 2015. I think for those like myself, it's best to save the cash and just use the older workouts and hit the pavement more. I feel a little sad when I watch these new workouts. It's missing the connection and spark that used to draw me in, that loving yet sweaty quality I became spoiled by. I stopped working out with other instructors because of this connection or lack there of from others. I miss her spirit, the Spirit, in her workouts.

Perhaps it's just me. But I'd bet there are many that feel this way. If you didn't collect her workouts prior to 2010-2011, you really cannot relate to this review. So it's for the old-schoolers, like myself.",1442966400,39,3350,4.550580431177446
7365069,4,B013HOZJCY,"Mile 1: EASY BEAT MILE
0-20:05
3 mph pace doing her usual movements.

Mile 2: BRISK BEAT MILE
20:05-35:20
4 mph pace doing movements like step/knees, v steps, 8 quick steps.

Mile 3: SUPER BEAT MILE
35:20-47:25
5 mph pace doing movements like shuffle/punch, jump rope, jogging. Because the pace is faster, this mile has more impact than the other two selections.

COOL DOWN and STRETCH:
47:25-52:25
or 12:00 on mile 3/Super Beat mile selection

BONUS SEGMENT:
This segment is to strengthen the mid section-the core.

0-11:00
You will be on the floor on your back doing movements like leg lifts, crunches, bicycle, bridge, scissors-several times repeated.

11:00-16:55
This segment is still on the floor, but you will be on your knees and not on your back. Movements include plank and leg lifts-couple times repeated.

16:55-21:10
Full body stretch on your back laying on the floor.

This entire dvd is just cardio-no strength training. My heart rate stayed in the 120-130s range which for me is fat burning mode. I consider myself an intermediate to advanced fitness level and have been doing Leslie Sansone workouts for about 5 years.

I enjoyed this workout and the different paces that you can do with the different walks. Because of my fitness level, I would use this dvd for my easier days or for family walks.

If you are looking for a tougher workout, or a workout that includes strength training-you won't get that with this dvd just to be clear.

I noticed that Leslie has been doing alot of boosted walking (jogging) and more intermediate movements in her last several DVD releases which appeals to some, but not others.

If you are looking for an easier pace and less complicated movements, I think you will like this workout! With the exception of a little bit of jogging in the 3rd walk, this DVD does not have high impact movements.

I received a complimentary copy of this DVD from a PR company in exchange for an honest review on my blog and social media-all opinions are my own. I also purchased an additional copy of this workout from Amazon.

7365070,4,B013HOZJCY,"I'm sorry guys! I just wasn't feeling this one. And that's okay, becuase her other videos are super. But this one...Meh. I would have given it 3 stars, but I gave it four becuase it actually delivers what it advertised on the front cover.

Walkers:
There were only two people I did not recognize. But Marvin is here, so is Wendy, Tami and Suzy from Walk to the Hits, Nick, and Kamilah, a face I hadn't seen in awhile from the colorful miles, 4-mile power walk, and Five really big miles. Her attitude is so expressive and she looks great.

Music:
The music is terrible, in which it would have been a lot better had she just used songs she had in the past. I've only enjoyed probably 2. But my ears couldn't pick it up. It was just very irritable and noisy. I'd give it a 3/5. But at the same time, I understand why it was designed that way, to get you to stay on the beat.

Easy Beat Mile:

There's a thorough warm-up with a song so annoying, I couldn't wait for it to go off. By the time the warm-up was over, she put us in a 3.0 mph walk. This is very low impact. But I found this mile to be pretty boring, but very simple, nothing new or fancy. By the time the second song hit, things were starting to get a little interesting. But one thing i noticed is that Leslie gets a bit distracted. I've never seen her this engaged in her walkers before to where she actually stops moving and just watches everybody else. There was a time where we did high knees while she kept talking to Wendy, and forgot about us a bit. So, my knees were getting tired.

Brisk Beat Mile:
This is a 4.0 mph walk. Two new moves are the v-step and 8-step. By the time I got to this mile I daydreamed...just zoned out. It was just pretty boring. I honestly could not mentally get into it.

SUPER Beat Mile:
This is a 5.0 mph walk. This has a slight high impact, but not much at all. She'll have you do one round of shifts with side punches. Then, there's a jump rope.

Cool Down:
This actually had a nice song, but the cool down was way too rushed. We should have been walking slowly a little longer than how she had it. That's one thing I wish she'd improve on, is longer and thorough cool downs.

Floor Work:
The floor is very relaxing. Everybody is there with her. You will do things from bridges, leg scissors, stretches, planks, she'll give you some varieties. But again...It was just not what I was looking for. I won't feel anything the next day from this. I felt like I was just moving for the heck of it on the mat.

In my honest opinion, this DVD is one I could have done without. But it was only $9, so, invest if you like, especially if you're looking for something that's steady with a little kick and not too much of it.

7365081,3,B013HOZJCY,"I have several of Leslie's videos and I enjoy almost all of them, but after doing this newly purchased one today, it's not my favorite. She has a very bubbly personality which I love, but she is especially chatty in this one and it's distracting!

7365100,5,B013HOZJCY,"I love Leslies DVDs. I own quite a few and actually trained for my one-time-only half marathon using one of her DVDs as a side from running.  I like this one in particular because it takes it up several notches, especially the five mph walk.
If I had one wish, I would wish that the cool down would be one separate track so if I wanted to (which I do often), I would put the five-mph walk on continuously without having to include the cool down every time.",1517097600,2,456,4.181818181818182
7365101,5,B013HOZJCY,"Another great video from, Leslie.  You won't find anything that feels particularly new in this video if you have used her workouts before (Leslie sticks to the four basic moves), but that's what's so good about her workouts.  They are never intimidating.  There is no special equipment for this one - just good old fashion speed to get your heart rate up.  It's a perfect video to use if you're traveling and don't want to pack hand weights or stretchy bands.  It's also under an hour and broken into three segments if you want to squeeze in a simple, uncomplicated workout.  I'm happy I bought this one.",1516492800,,604,4.598130841121495

The three aerobic segments move at increasing speed, but are all very manageable.  The last segment gives a good overall stretch and strengthen workout to the whole body and is nice to do on Friday.

Same old stuff for the first part of the DVD. I noticed that you have to go through all of the same old stuff to get to the new (and faster paced) workout. Why couldn't they format it differently? I would have liked it better if the entire workout was more fast paced with some of the newer moves thrown in earlier. Nick, you're cute, but you don't have to say, ""oh yeah"" and look so darn happy all the time. The shaky camera thing just gives me a headache.

It often seemed as though she was trying to upstage Leslie, and that got annoying.  The rest of the walkers, and there are a total of 8 of them in this one, were easier to take.

7365148,5,B013HOZJCY,"A self proclaimed fitness junkie, I have lost ~ 60 pounds and kept it off (for more than a year) with Leslie's help.  Her spunky attitude, uptempo beats, easy yet effective steps/moves, and merry band of walkers have kept me buying Just WALK videos almost monthly for the past couple of years.

This video has probably one of her most advanced segments, mile three which is at 5 MPH.  That mile alone is ~2k steps in 12 minutes, and all three miles combined are 6655 steps in 47 minutes.  I do the first 2 miles with an internal frame backpack loaded with 60 pounds (Disclaimer: I started at 20 pounds 2 years ago and slowly worked my way up) because those miles are truly low impact but still involve enough arm & core work that I rarely need to lift weights at the gym.  Mile 3 is higher impact with some jogging and jump ropes (imaginary, of course) but for me, it is perfect!

In my opinion, this would be a good ""gateway"" WALK video, in that it's one of Leslie's easiest to follow and one can advance to the faster miles with improved fitness.",1482624000,4,1048,4.348717948717948

7365189,5,B013HOZJCY,"I have over 15 Leslie Sansone dvds and have lost a lot of weight and gotten into a truly healthy lifestyle with her help.  My routine tends to be a 3 mile video every day with longer ones when I can.  This Burn To The Beat is an excellent workout that definitely gives you a good burn and has me fully energized by the end.  It is also excellent for it provides the user with many options.  Mile 1 is an estimated 20 minute 3 mile per hour walk.  You then progress to a 15 minute 4 mile per hour walk and then you get to the amazing 13 minute 5 mile per hour walk.  This dvd allows a beginner to start by only doing the first mile and then jumping to the cool down, intermediates can do the first 2 miles and then the cool down or do as I do and do all 3 miles. I find the progression of exercise levels provides a more thorough workout.  I am getting a real thorough warm up with that first mile and even though 3 miles per hour it is still very energizing.  The 4 mile per hour mile is a perfect pace that has your hear rate really up and you are constantly on the move.  The last mile which is 5 miles per hour is indeed walking like a runner as Leslie says.  By progressing through the 3 levels of intensity I find I can really get into doing the moves correctly.  Leslie is filled with helpful information throughout this dvd,  is filled with motivation and I love the rest of the workout crew as well.  Nick is always my favorite and he is my go to as to how to do the moves.  I am pretty much at the same level as him and watching him helps me even more to be sure I am doing all the moves to their most beneficial.  When done with this dvd I really feel I have had an excellent workout.  I highly recommend this dvd for all level users from beginner to advanced.  It is one I use the most.

7365208,5,B013HOZJCY,Have never been disappointed by any of Leslie's DVD's I have purchased in the past. This is one of my new favorites. Love the music.,1459728000,,132,4.32
7365209,3,B013HOZJCY,"After a long hiatus from exercising due to several serious injuries I consider myself a beginner exercise.  I have been exercising regularly for less than six months. I am looking for exercise videos to help build my strength and fitness back up. As such, I have decided to borrow a variety of DVDs from the library before investing in purchasing them.

I had tried Leslie Sansone's Just Walk DVDs several years ago as a way to get into shape and decided to try one of her new DVDs. This brought me to the Burn to the Beat DVD. The workout is based on four moves, stepping in place, kicking, knee ups and side steps. Leslie says if you can do those four moves you can do the entire workout. I found that to be true.  The workouts are based on those simple moves as well as other basic aerobic steps such as V steps. There were only two steps in the 3 miles total that took me a couple tries before I got them down.

Music: The music in the video is instrumental beats that go with the speed of the workout. I did not find the music horrible but after doing the workout once with the music etc. on I ended up muting the TV and playing my own workout music mix while working out to the music.

Instructor: Leslie Sansone is a bit of a chatterbox and some of the background people have microphones as well so not only do you get to listen to Leslie you get to listen to the other people too. Some people may like this, I do not. I find Leslie to chatty which is another reason I muted the DVD and listened to my own music. She does do a good job of explaining the steps and does a good job of cuing.

The workout gives you the option of doing the entire workout of all three miles followed by a cool down or you can pick the mile of your choice. There is also a bonus after the burn segment. The first mile is the easy beat mile which lasts 20 minutes and is supposed to mimic walking 3 mph. I found that fairly accurate. The second mile, the Brisk Beat Mile, is 15 minutes and is supposed to mimic walking 4 mph. This mile included one of the tricky steps but otherwise was easy to keep up with. The third mile, the Super Beat Mile, is 12 minutes and is supposed to mimic walking 5 mph. It had the other tricky step. I am not sure how they figure out the pace to mph but I don't think it is accurate. I walk outside on the days that I don't do exercise videos and walking at 4 mph or jogging at 5 mph is a lot more challenging for me than these segments of the video. If you complete all three miles and the cool down your workout is just over 50 minutes.

The bonus, After the Burn is a 20 minute segment of easy floor exercises. Crunches, leg lifts, planks etc.

Overall, I give this DVD a 3.5 star. It is definitely an easy, beginner level workout but I think you would get tired of it very quickly. I have down it 2-3 times a week for 3 weeks and I am already bored. This one will be going back to the library and I will be trying something else.",1459555200,,2948,4.061962134251291

7365220,3,B013HOZJCY,"This is the newest addition to my growing collection of Leslie Sansone DVDs. I like how it starts out slow, then picks up the pace. I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers are referring to about bad camera angles. I thought the camera work was well done and kept moving without any abrupt interruptions. The music was also good for keeping the pace throughout the workout. The steps are easy enough to jump right in and follow along without much preview. There are several moments though, where Leslie stops walking and starts kibitzing with the other walkers and gets distracted from the routine. When this happened during knee-lifts, I became very fatigued and wondered when she would get back on track with the workout. This happened several times which made me skeptical about using this video again. The last chapter contains a whole body stretch and some Pilates moves, which I didn't care for. But that's just my own personal preference as I don't like Pilates.",1455840000,3,974,4.803571428571429

7365225,3,B013HOZJCY,"I have several of Leslie's workouts and love having the indoor walking option when weather is bad. Especially like the boosts.

This DVD was a decent workout. I enjoyed the three miles each being different paces. Enjoyable.

What I DIDN'T like:
(1) The bobbing and flying camera. Stay still and focused for heaven's sake.
(2) The mikes on the walkers that picked up their inane comments. Distracting.
(3) Smarmy, smug smiles and attitudes among some of the ""walkers."" I will not name names.
(4) Leslie seemed disinterested and cared more about yakking it up with the ""talent"" than in being our leader this time.

Frankly, if I were at the YMCA and saw this class in action I would not feel welcome or interested. It gives the appearance of being for young hardbodies and not for those of us who are fighting the real fight of flab. I wish there had been some folks who seemed to be over 35 (Marvin may have been) and possibly had an ounce of fat on them. I would have felt it was for me in that case.

I see Amazon will give me $1.01 in gift credit if I send this back. Since i like so many of her other workouts better, this particular Leslie may just go back.",1455062400,8,1161,4.361111111111111

7365240,5,B013HOZJCY,Great video,1450828800,,11,5.0
7365241,5,B013HOZJCY,"this is probably her best DVD as far as I am concerned and I own about 12 of hers. What I love about this one is there are a total of 3 miles, but she starts you off slowly and gradually builds you up in each mile instead of slamming you right into a hard workout. By the end of the 3rd mile I am fairly sweaty and breathing hard. And each mile gets shorter, the 1st is approx 20 mins, the 2nd is 15 and the 3rd is about 12 which takes me a little past my minimum workout time of atleast 45 mins.",1450828800,2,496,3.7333333333333334
7365242,4,B013HOZJCY,"I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan and this CD lives up to her reputation.  This is a fast-moving heart pounding 3 mile walking workout.  I particularly enjoyed the bonus 20-minute muscle workout.  Relaxing, but effective.  I have only one complaint...I tired of her endless chatting with the walkers behind her.  I appreciate her upbeat nature, but this was just annoying.  I'll continue to use this workout, but geech, shut up!!!",1450310400,2,427,4.943661971830986
7365243,5,B013HOZJCY,These workouts are easy to follow and give a great workout.,1450137600,,59,4.454545454545454
7365244,4,B013HOZJCY,"Absolutely love Leslie and this is a great DVD. My only ""problem"" is that I THOUGHT (so it's my mistake) that is was 3 different full workouts giving you options.  I didn't realize it was 3 different miles",1449446400,,205,4.394736842105263
7365245,5,B013HOZJCY,Great and fun video from beginning to end and before you know it it's all over! Nicely builds from a 3 mph to 4 mph then 5 mph pace which you can modify up or down based on your individual needs. The variety is also great when time is limited and you can't do the full 3 miles (perfect for those mornings I want a quick 12 or 15 minute workout before going to work or church!).  I enjoy the banter of Leslie and her crew and she is her usual encouraging self. I haven't done it every time but the after the burn is also nice. Highly recommend! I don't get the negative reviews.,1449360000,,577,4.017391304347826
7365246,4,B013HOZJCY,It's good like other ones as well I think I own them all  LIKE THE HIP AND THIGHS ONE IT'S GREAT,1449100800,,96,3.5714285714285716
7365247,5,B013HOZJCY,Just getting started with Leslie and I like her style.,1449100800,,54,4.5
7365248,5,B013HOZJCY,"This two workout DVD is great - the 30 minute walk session is challenging with a bit of walk-running and I like the weights session. It's challenging, but not stressful.",1449014400,,169,4.666666666666667
7365249,5,B013HOZJCY,"This one is just right. Marvin is a gentleman, Nick is fun, and Kamila is delightful. I'm always glad to see these walkers. .",1448755200,,125,4.25
7365250,5,B013HOZJCY,"this is one of my favorite Leslies - my only complaint I think is there's not a way to choose 2 of the 3 walks with warmup and cooldown separate. I sometimes only have time for 1 or 2 miles not all 3 but would like a brief warmup for all but the first mile though I can do my own cooldown / stretch but would be nice to have the option to pick like on her 10 min walks dvd.

the first mile is about 20 min and has the warmup and is a slower pace (I was a little bored til I amped it up a bit with more arms). the 2nd mile is about 15 min and I prefer this pace once I'm warmed up. the 3rd mile I've only done maybe once (due to time and getting familiar with the dvd by starting at the beginning) this one is even faster from what I remember and seems a little more impact though all her stuff can be modified up or down IMO.

I would like the option to program though since I would prefer to add the 1st mile to the end for a 4 mile walk when I have time or do a warmup then mile 2 and 3 then mile 1...

also this one uses SPACE unless you're ok with modifying. she does double sidesteps but also does a lot f 4 (or 8 steps) but 4 'sets' - instead of doubles she does 4 forward back and side steps. I was doing diagonal in my room (and it's pretty big and open) if you get frustrated with having to do singles or doubles when she's doing 4s then you will be frustrated several times in this walk. the 2nd mile she takes the 4 forward back 'up' a little - I added a light jog - but I tend to do that anyways if I feel more energetic.

I liked the music in this dvd ok and the setting - she doesnt' use her 'out of shape normal walkers' in this one- Nick is there along with some other fit looking people though their ages vary - there's an older looking guy but he's pretty in shape IMO. I enjoy Leslie's variety - I mix her walks with Jessica Smith's for variety - but she's offering more variety now- I have a LOT of her walks and some tend to be used more than others. some of y faves are  her older walks along with the new offerings she's done. there have been a few of hers I've not liked (one is a 4 mile one with a 2 mile classic walk and 2 mile more intense walk- that one has TOO much bouncing IMO and a 3 mile super walk that came in a set focuses way too much on moms for me(no kids so no interest) but otherwise hers fall into like and use a lot and ""I'll do for variety' and just af ew in 'nuh uh not for me'. I'm also not a fan of her 'gadgets' and this one doesn't have gadgets - also not a lot of knee lifts/kicks that I can recall in the first 2 miles- she does a lot of side steps and forward back but DOES mix in the other moves just not like she's going in order with a set number of steps, kicks, knees",1448668800,,2724,3.7469458987783595
7365251,5,B013HOZJCY,This is my favorite Leslie Sansone DVD. I love the easy-to-follow beat of the music. There are no words - it is just an uplifting tempo sound. I never get bored with this routine - I actually should challenge myself a little bit more (I do add light hand weights to the routine to work my arms more) by rotating my work-outs but this DVD brightens my morning.,1448668800,,359,4.294117647058823

7365256,4,B013HOZJCY,"Although I love her other new DVDS (Walking off the Pounds & Five Boosted Miles), Burn to the Beat is not my favorite.  There's something about the repetitive beat that gets monotonous quickly.  Leslie has one of her walkers count for her several times, and since the walker is not miked well, it is difficult to hear. In summary, if you have her other DVDs and need something else for variety, then I recommend this.  However, if you are trying to make a decision on which of her new DVDs to buy, this one would not be be top choice.",1447545600,2,534,4.32

7365274,5,B013HOZJCY,"OK, FINALLY she's brought back a couple of ladies who aren't 20-30 years old and perhaps aren't doing everything just perfectly.  I LOVE that since all people need to work at their own pace and these ladies kept moving so they, too, are getting a workout despite not being able to keep up with others.  Do love seeing Nick in each one - I'd miss him if he was gone.  Better pace than Walking off the Pounds - you can get a good 30 minute workout (2 miles) and it gets your heart rate up.  Good job!",1446940800,6,498,4.103092783505154

7365276,5,B013HOZJCY,This is a fun workout. I have several of Leslie's workout videos and this is my new favorite. It starts out with a 20 min mile at a steady pace then gets faster during mile 2 and super fast for mile 3. It is a great workout especially for those of us that have several of her tapes and there are only so many moves that can be done while walking in your living room but yet she manages to keep the moves feeling fresh and even throwing in a new twist to some of the moves. I have not done the bonus segment so I can't rate that.,1446681600,3,528,3.853211009174312

7365281,5,B013HOZJCY,"I have always loved these videos by Leslie Sansone. I feel the same way about this one. It is definitely a great workout. You can choose between three different mile workouts, each one a little faster than the other. They are awesome. You can burn anywhere from 100 to just over 400 calories if you do the exercises along with the bonus floor exercise portion. I always use a heart rate monitor when I work out since I love to see what I burn and I am always happy with the burns I get from this video. I would definitely recommend this product.",1446163200,14,545,4.300970873786408
7365282,5,B013HOZJCY,I liked this one and will be adding it to my Leslie workout rotation.  I am a regular exerciser and I got a decent heart rate increase from this one.  I use her videos when the weather is too nasty for outside exercise and for recovery days.  The music is fine.  I appreciate Leslie's positivity.  Not sure that having the walkers wear mics was the best choice but that is a minor quibble to what I thought was a solid walking workout.,1446076800,,435,4.2560975609756095

I find that the miles are way too easy, especially the first one. I am really looking forward to her  next two DVDs coming later in October and one in November. I really hope that they are much better. After working out with Leslie for many years, I still want to keep my shape and be healthy and this means that I need to work harder. Leslie SHOULD make DVDs for the advance walkers and some for just the beginners, this way, we would know which ones to buy. I regret buying this one without viewing it. I AM HOPING THAT HER 5 BOOSTED MILES coming in November will be fast and sweaty. Also, I wish Leslie would do her next workouts in another location. ALWAYS THE SAME LOCATION IS GETTING BORING.

----

It must be quite a task to come up with new variations of just 4 basic walking steps for each new DVD released by Leslie over the last two decades, and after reading some of the not so favourable reviews, I think some people are forgetting that this is a walking workout, i.e. how much more can you do than a few variations of those same 4 steps?  I don't mind the music in this DVD nor the camera work and it's nice to see new participants, as well as some of the regular ones again. My favourite is Nick (who is also a walker and strength leader in the new ""Miracle Miles"" DVDs). I'm very happy with this new addition to my collection 30+ walking DVDs.  I think this DVD will appeal to many age groups and also to different fitness levels.",1443225600,130,1163,4.052631578947368
7365342,5,B013HOZJCY,"Not sure why this one is getting so many neutral reviews, I just finished and it's my new fave. The cast is great, very enthusiastic and diverse with lots of familiar faces. The music is good - all instrumental, and nothing that stood out as annoying. Leslie is her usual, positive self. She does go around and talk to cast members several times, but I enjoyed it. The interaction with the cast is fun. I didn't mind the camera angles at all, it isn't to noticeable and kind of had a reality TV vibe. Not a bad thing. She throws in a few newer moves in this one, and a small bit of high impact - both things I enjoy.
About me: I'm 42, intermediate exerciser, have purchased every Leslie DVD for the last 15 or more years. I love that she can't still produce a new DVD and it doesn't feel old or stale. Leslie is my go-to for cardio, and though I own many other DVD's, I always come back to her.",1443139200,72,894,4.14367816091954
7365343,5,B013HOZJCY,"This was a real let down after her last few new ones.  I was hoping to get something new in the cardio group as I alternate with strength training.  I did not do the first mile as it seemed too slow, so did miles two and three which were nothing special.  I realize there is not much one can change with the 4 basic steps, but she added to the reps and a new V move and that was about it. The stretch was the best part, although I am still trying to figure out where the arms and thigh toning comes in.  It is a lot of core work which was great with bridges, planks and some side stretches.  Because I did not do the first mile there was no warm up and given I work out within half hour of getting out of bed this was not a good thing  so will need to stretch before I start.  I am hoping the Miracle Mile workout comes to Amazon as it is looks awesome.  I love Leslie and will  continue to get her DVD'S, but need to be more selective as I am an advanced walker and this was more for beginners as far as I am concerned. UPDATE.  This is now one of my favorite workouts. I do it every 3 days as part of my cardio workouts.  I walk faster then she does, never walk in place. I love the 8 step count and have found by the time the workout is done, minus the excellent core work which is now part of my daily PT routine I have 6k steps on my Fitbit.  I just wish she would come out with other weight training DVD's soon",1443139200,8,1416,3.8448275862068964

7365345,3,B013HOZJCY,"I'm giving this only 3 stars because the video work is AWFUL.

The workout was very good and the paces are as advertised. The camera work is AWFUL. It is almost as if the camera operator was also doing the workout because in many parts the camera is moving side to side and up and down.....so much that in  a few parts it made me feel dizzy! And this is a new release - I'm disappointed that the video work is so awful.

The entire walking part of the video, from warm up through the cool down walk, gave me 3.16 miles. I wear a Fitbit and I know the steps accurately measure. I have also done the ""Super Beat Mile"" alone and that is NOT a full mile, but more like .85 miles.",1442966400,3,675,4.022388059701493

8727735,5,B013HOZJCY,Always love her workout DVD's.  Nice and comfy to do at home.  You can't beat the fact of not having to drive to a fitness facility and not pay a membership fee.  You are free to choose what time of day or evening and can adjust how much time you can spend doing it.  Highly recommend.,1533600000,,285,4.035714285714286
8727736,3,B013HOZJCY,"Leslie is my favorite. I have several of her DVDs. I do alternate with a few other instructors just to break monotony. I decided to buy a new dvd from Leslie and debated between this one, the boosted miles and one with abs.

I was hoping for more of a challenge. The first mile is slow to me. The other 2 miles are faster which is good. There is a new move in the last mile that resembles jumping rope. I really like the bonus section for abs and core. I felt like this dvd had more positive reviews than the others I was looking at which I why I chose it. And its hard for me to give Leslie a bad review because its not bad its just ok.",1530144000,,637,3.9
8727737,5,B013HOZJCY,"This is on of Leslie's better tapes. Her only problem is all her chatter, but at least the cast is following her and not doing their own thing. And we don't have to listen to crazy noises from her group. I prefer her a little more serious instead of losing the beat because she can't quit laughing. Make more dvds like this.",1529798400,,324,4.241935483870968
8727738,5,B013HOZJCY,One of my favorites. Very energetic and its easy to follow.,1529539200,,59,4.454545454545454
8727739,4,B013HOZJCY,"I think all of Leslie's videos can be greatly improved if you use your own music and just follow your moves! I am sore, I gave the moves my all and I think there was only one small part that had jumping-I just walked right through (2nd floor problems). I used a spotify cardio [playlist and it made the workout really fun. It would be five stars if it didn't include the jumping bit-I do walk videos to not jump. If I want jumping I could just do Zumba videos or almost any other work-out video!",1528502400,,495,4.166666666666667
