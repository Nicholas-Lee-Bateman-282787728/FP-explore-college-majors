If you are a Collector this one is a must.
I have collected 2005/08/10/11..
They're all good but for some reasson this one I would have to say
stands above.
No matter how many riders have been killed at the TT races; in 100 years
more than 200 have lost their life in this sport.. it will not make it
any slower.. the risk involved it's what makes this festival so attractive.
Fast passed, full of adrenaline.
Like any armchair or active motorcyclist you know that we can never have enough,
you'll be coming back for more!!",1345507200,,583,4.457943925233645
8292726,5,B001DCUX9W,"For the last 101 years hardy and brave souls have been racing the fastest motorcycles in the world on the longest road race course in the world. They have used the Snaefell 'mountain course' since 1911 and 2007 brought us the first 130mph average lap of the 37 3/4 mile track. Duke video have been providing the 'long review' for many years.

This year the coverage is even better than before. More and higher resolution on bike shots cut in with more and better resolution external and air to ground shots. In the 1990s when a bike went out you had to believe they had identified the rider, now you can read the number yourself and even see his expression. On bike shots are so sharp you can see the gravel in the road surface as they accelerate towards 200mph. They have, somehow, eliminated most of the sun flare issues that used to plague the on-bike cameras in the past. The only remaining issues seem to be bugs and vibration, but they have so many cameras on each race that one bug splat does not ruin the coverage.

The coverage follows all the races, the three 1000cc races (Superbike, Superstock, Senior), the 600cc Junior and the two 600cc sidecar races.

The racing was faster than ever too, it seems like all the bikes have some trouble putting the power down without flipping over backwards over each crest. Even the sidecar outfits are slipping and sliding around. I can especially recommend the race between the first two sidecar outfits in the second race. Fairings rubbing at well north of 150mph. A real competition.

Anyway, words, or at least mine, can't do it justice. I think it's well worth buying to see for yourself.",1219104000,,1642,4.613013698630137
