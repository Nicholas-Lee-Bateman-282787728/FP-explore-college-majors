6161363,5,B00HF98SKI,GOOD INFORMATION ON THIS STORY AND HOW THING MIGHT HAVE POSSIBLE GOT STARTED 3 DIFFERENT STORIES ABOUT NOAH AND THE ARK,1403049600,2,119,4.714285714285714
6161364,3,B00HF98SKI,"This was OK, but didn't open anything up very much and seemed a bit cautious and weak in the way it handled the story of Noah and its implications. Broke no ground that I could see.",1400716800,4,181,4.055555555555555
6161365,5,B00HF98SKI,"I WOULD recommend this movie to anyone. It is very well made, and so Interesting!!! Do not hesitate to buy it!",1398211200,5,110,4.285714285714286
6161366,5,B00HF98SKI,"The Bible: Testament Documentaries are serious.
Rusell Crowe-Anthony Hopkins's new movie about the great Ark & Flood is a ""Science Fiction Fantasy Film"" ... misleading the true story of Noah with more of 900 yrs of age. His Wife and His three sons with their wifes (to one to each young men); counting 8 people in total, without having babies inside or out the Ark (only after the flood)on land.
The movie is filled with good acting very well performed by the two women (lead and supporting actress. It's a fantasy with(Angels falling on Earth and turning into ""Rock-Lava Talking Giants"") helping Noah & fighting the battle with the desperate rebels(sinners).",1398124800,,659,4.945945945945946
6161367,1,B00HF98SKI,As the first review said Please if you are looking for the new  Crow release 2014- THIS IS NOT IT Amazon made a fool of me on this one . Into the trash for my copy. Waste of my time and money.,1396742400,,192,3.5714285714285716
6161368,1,B00HF98SKI,"It might be a good movie but it was not the movie I thought I was ordering. That said, my mistake so I'll keep it",1396742400,,113,3.56
6161369,5,B00HF98SKI,This is the documentary from Time Warner's History Channel. It is an interesting and beautifully done rendition of the Biblical account of Noah and the Ark.,1396137600,10,156,5.038461538461538
6161370,1,B00HF98SKI,"When I chose this movie I thought it was the New Movie Noah, only because it said next to the title 2014.  I feel like this was just a way to trick me into thinking it was the new movie with Russell Crowe . I chose not to send it back because of the shipping price I would encounter. Please if you are looking for the new release 2014- THIS IS NOT IT..Thanks",1394928000,43,358,3.904109589041096
8632265,5,B00HF98SKI,awesome,1516492800,,7,7.0
8632266,1,B00HF98SKI,This is so heavily dependent on Jewish mystical tradition and possibly Gnostic tradition and not on biblical information that it is worthless as a resource on what happened in Noah's day or Noah himself. Utterly vain fantasy. Not worth even a moment of serious consideration.,1489881600,,275,5.133333333333334
8632267,4,B00HF98SKI,"This features three documentaries which are each about 45 minutes. The first shares legends of Noah that appear to be gathered from a number of sources. Includes interviews and paintings.

The second is more of a scientific approach and examines the impact of floods. The third is back to a Biblical view with interviews and paintings. Occasional insight.",1484697600,,355,5.120689655172414
8632268,1,B00HF98SKI,Really dumb and poorly produced.,1458691200,3,32,5.6
8632269,3,B00HF98SKI,Didn't seem to correlate with the bible as I thought it would.,1438646400,,62,4.25
8632270,2,B00HF98SKI,"It claims to be a documentary.  I found it very squishy scholastically.  They mish-moshed Old Testament Bible, with Jewish Midrash & the Pseudepigrapha (the Jewish old testament version of the Apocrypha).  Having read all of the above, I had a clue when the producers were bringing in questionable information.  Only once did I hear them refer to ""according to the Midrash"" -- and most non-Jews would not catch that.  Frequently they simply said "" according to Jewish tradition"", which didn't let you know if it was Midrash or Pseudepigrapha.

If you find things like the Pseudepigrapha tantalizing I would recommend the book ""The Other Bible"" most libraries carry this book.  If your library doesn't have a copy, use the Inter-Library Loan option.  It usually takes about 3 weeks to get a book from another library delivered to your library.",1429574400,2,842,5.0071942446043165
8632271,1,B00HF98SKI,"NOT BIBLICAL AT ALL!  In fact they are trying to put doubt in your mind.  If you believe the Bible don't get this.  AND it was poorly put together....the info was put together in a choppy, kind-of unorganized way, that didn't make much sense.  I threw it away.",1420243200,5,260,4.354166666666667
8632272,2,B00HF98SKI,Interesting but I found it a bit off track.,1415404800,,43,3.888888888888889
8632273,5,B00HF98SKI,"Amazing! I don't know W=H=A=T a-m-a-z-e-s me M=O=S=T...
the fact that h-a-l-f of the ten reviewers THOUGHT this was the
new Russell Crowe movie... or that five of these people actually
had the ''stones'' to SAY so! They went with ""2014"" and just ass-
umed [hyphenated wrong on purpose] that this was the theatrical
release.
YOU can keep the theatrical release, I want these three docu-dra-
ma-mentaries from THE HISTORY CHANNEL... YOU buy the one
about the Stone-Transformers, and history based on a sub-plot of
an old TV-mini-series. Doesn't anyone read The Bible anymore? Oh
yeah... people don't READ [period] anymore. And, by-the-way, I am
not the sharpest tool in the shed, MYSELF, but I know you should do
like a carpenter does: Measure TWICE; cut once... LOOK before you
LEAP; READ before you hit the PURCHASE button...
No..ah... get it?
No-ah didn't buy the wrong movie... I bought the RIGHT three!",1411171200,7,905,4.9605263157894735
8632274,4,B00HF98SKI,"Was a good movie, BUT I thought is was the newest version of Noah (2014).  It should have been posted or advertised differently, thought it was the one at the movies.",1405209600,,166,4.354838709677419
