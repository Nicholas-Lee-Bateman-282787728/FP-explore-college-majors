8366365,5,B001ULDK3W,"If you think about adventures you would like to undertake, things you say you want to do, people who you think about but never have the time to reach out to...please don't wait.  Life is short - we'll all die.  That is a given.  This film is truly inspirational!  It really takes only a moment to make a decision.

I hope you enjoy this film and are energized to do those things you have thought about doing, but have yet to do.  Sometimes it takes more time and energy to make excuses!  So, live free, in peace and with much joy!

8366366,5,B001ULDK3W,"Many motorcycle clubs do charity rides.  This club happens to be the most awesome group of compassionate women I have ever seen! They dedicated the documentary to one of their own; K.Lee, a Renaissance woman who took the last ride she could manage due to a long battle against cancer.  Even if you are not a motorcycle rider (I am not) you will be touched by the generosity and good will toward all from the women in this film.",1238371200,3,427,4.3924050632911396

The sisterhood, camaraderie, compassion, free-spirit, determination and good-will is who we are. And it all started with an idea for a roadtrip.

Battling the intense heat, hail, fierce winds, thunder, lightning and rain...not to mention the bugs in our teeth! We wouldn't trade this experience for anything.

Besides traveling through 13 states on our motorcycles, the highlight was bringing toys and gifts to the homeless children of Presley Place in Tennessee! I'll never forget that.

This documentary will make you laugh, smile and cry.

Thank you John!
