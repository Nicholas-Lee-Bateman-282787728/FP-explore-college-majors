7847466,5,6303457800,"This movie  begins with a hanging: Lupin III (or so they say). When Zenigata (voice of David Povall) comes upon another person after driving the stake into Lupin, who does he come face-to-face with but Lupin III (voice of Bob Bergen)! Now Lupin's after the Philosopher's Stone, and he steals it. Fujiko (voice of Edie Mirman) then double-crosses him and realizes that this Philosopher's Stone was a fake! Lupin and co. then get attacked by mysterious forces and flee to the coast. Lupin is then kidnapped by Mamo (voice of Robert Axelrod). But Lupin escapes to Colombia, where Zenigata, after realizing that the Lupin case has been finished, resigns his commision at INTERPOL and goes on a vendetta against Lupin. Only then does Mamo tell Lupin and co. about the history of mankind. Then an earthquake (perhaps caused by Mamo himself) occurs. Lupin manages to find Mamo and Fujiko in the ruins. Since Mamo and Fujiko were Adam and Eve, he figures, then Lupin himself was the snake in Mamo's plan (Genesis 3 joke). Mamo then tells Lupin that it was indeed the clone of Lupin that died at the gallows in Transylvania and is soon killed by his own weapon. But the real Mamo was just a huge brain! Afterwards, Special Agent Gordon (voice of Michael Forest) states that all who know the secret of Mamo must be terminated, and he unleashes the military on Lupin and Zenigata! (Rated PG-13, suitable for ages 16 and up; nudity and sexual situations.)",1125273600,,1443,4.749003984063745
