2156983,5,B00061QK0W,"Whether it be written or completely improv, Will Ferrell is THE man.  This movie is non stop hilarity and the out-takes are just as fun.

SNL is absolutely not the same without all of Mr. Ferrell's wild and wacky characters.",1104278400,3,224,4.575
2156984,3,B00061QK0W,"Will Ferrell is a heck of a talent.  Although I've never been a huge fan of SNL, I must say that Ferrell had some of the best moments on it.  With last year's OLD SCHOOL and ELF, he proved that has the potential to carry a movie by himself.  Sadly, with ANCHORMAN, the problem isn't with Ferrell himself, but mainly the writing on the film (ironically, co-written by Ferrell).  The film is choppy, uneven and underwhelming.  However, it does have some pretty good laughs spattered throughout.  Much of the movie feels improvised... mainly because much of it was.  The 90-page(ish) script had a first cut of about 3 1/2 hours(ish).  So, a lot of stuff was trimmed.  In fact, so much was trimmed that with this set, they have released a feature-length film entitled ""Wake Up, Ron Burgandy - The Lost Movie"".  The film contains many scenes that didn't make it into the theatrical cut, many alternate scenes, and even an entire subplot tossed from the original film involving a radical group of bank robbers calling themselves ""The Alarm Clock"".  ""Wake Up"" is funny, but like ANCHORMAN, feels very uneven - but has many funny moments.  If you have to get an ANCHORMAN DVD, get this 2-pack set.  If anything, it pushes your bonus material up by 92 minutes.",1104278400,,1251,4.657534246575342
2156985,4,B00061QK0W,"I can't understand why so many people gave this movie such negative reviews.  I've seen this movie twice and thought it was absolutely hilarious, and so did everyone else in the theatre.  I haven't laughed that hard or heard more people laugh at a movie in a long time.  I consider myself to have a sophisticated humor, and I still found this movie to be really enjoyable.  I highly recommend it!",1098662400,3,396,4.535211267605634
2156986,4,B00061QK0W,"Comedy has been looking for an 'everyman'...someone that can be funny in just about every role thrown at him.  Phil Hartman was one of these, and when he died, there was a big, gaping void that somehow never had been filled...until now.  Will Farrell has been able to play to hell everything from an overgrown elf to an arrogant TV newscaster with such a flair.  He has truly come into his own with this latest release.  On the other hand, many people outside the broadcasting industry (of which I'm in) may not get some of the jokes in the movie.  You may notice that there's a minimal amount of profanity in this movie...the four-letter F*** word back then was far more shocking than it is now.  Which made it all the more funny when Farrell's character said it on the air.  Not exactly a blockbuster, but still a strong success.",1096156800,2,831,4.5

The movie isn't really a sequel they just had a lot of extra footage and erroneous storylines that they edited together. That being said, WATCH THIS! Haha we're still quoting this movie.

2156989,1,B00061QK0W,"As of January 2009, this ""double feature"" costs about $20 more than Anchorman alone. What do you get for your extra $20? All the deleted scenes from Anchorman put into a coherent new movie. But these aren't scenes that were deleted for timing, these were deleted because they NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY THE PUBLIC. Wake Up has, maybe, two funny scenes. It's not worth $2 more, let alone $20. Buy Anchorman without Wake Up and be happy.",1231804800,2,439,4.569620253164557

Loved Anchorman in the cinema (nearly choked to death on my popcorn your know - ah, good times) and the DVD is even better with the additional full length movie 'Wake Up Ron Burgundy'. The extras are great too, especially Ron's ESPN job interview and his MTV Awards interview with JC.

Anchorman is definately in my Top 10 favourites and its keeping some pretty impressive company in there too, I can tell you.

So buy it and laugh your socks off. Just be careful to swallow your popcorn properly young man!",1179964800,,522,4.602150537634409

The second disc with the 'Alternate Movie' Wake up Ron Burgandy is just as rich in special features as the main disc!

Both of these films will also give you a boat load of quotable lines that are funny no matter how many times you hear them.

I cant beleive the ""Glass Case of Emotion"" scene didn't get an Oscar nod!

2156993,5,B00061QK0W,"Now you can own the hilarious comedy triumph ""Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy"" Unrated and Uncalled for edition with an all new half assed, but funny continuation film ""Wake up Ron Burgundy"" As the boys go in on a news story of a group of criminals called ""the Alarm Clock"" who kidnap Veronica, it's a funny, delightful direct to DVD flick, in which the real major motion picture is way better, because it just is, it has more of story, but this 2nd film is fun, if you loved Anchorman, I give it 5 because it's two movies together, if was just Anchorman it gets 4 stars.

2156994,5,B00061QK0W,"Commenting strictly on the Bonus DVD, ""Wake Up Ron Burgundy"", I must say that my expectations were far surpassed. I was expecting a bonus disc of deleted and extended scenes, cast notes, etc... I had no idea they had filmed enough footage to cut another movie together. I loved the original Anchorman movie, so I was pretty excited to see this ""bonus movie"".

""Wake Up Ron Burgundy"" contains some scenes that could easily have been used in the original movie. There is some hilarious material to be discovered on this disc. The DVD also contains Rehearsal footage, Ron Burgundy's award acceptance speeches, MTV Movie Award interviews and even some skits they seemed to film for no other reason than their own amusement. This is great material to have if you like the ""Channel 4 News Team"", as they are truly permitted to run wild in these bonus features. I have not been able to find this DVD offered on its own and I'm assuming it is of limited quantity, so get it while you can...

As far as I know, the only way to get it is to purchase it in the bundle with the original. I actually had to buy the movie again when I found out there was another DVD to be seen. The original had left me with countless lines to quote and so many scenes I found myself rewinding over and over again that I decided to splurge and get the bonus disc along with another original copy.

If you enjoyed Ron, Champ, Brian & Brick in Anchorman, you will definitely enjoy this movie.

2156996,2,B00061QK0W,"The title of my review says it all.  The first time I saw this film I passed it off as childish and ridiculous.  I thought Adam Sandler was over-the-top and childish, but Will Ferrell takes the cake.  The jokes are very twisted in this film, but the storyline is well narrated and the characters are well developed.  Ferrell did a decent number on this one.
Steve Carroll's character was one of the funniest.  It was bizarre characters like Carroll's which made the movie so funny.  Vince Vaughn did well in his role.  Ben Stiller's appearance was most confusing, but the fighting scene is a riot (get it, haha? bad joke).  I don't know how the movie could have been written or acted better.  Maybe the dopey and immature Adam Sandler should take a hint from this film, grow up, and write something similar.  Lately, Sandler's films have been stupid and trashy, but Will Ferrell has emerged onto the moviemaking scene and is now one of the U.S.'s fastest rising movie comedians.  Two thumbs up, Ferrell.  Keep the movies cranking.",1125273600,,1030,4.692737430167598
2156997,5,B00061QK0W,"This movie is great. Will Ferrell is one of the funniest actors out there. I don't know what some of these people are talking about saying it's so bad. I think that rather than being aimed at people with low intelligence levels, (being a 4.0 student myself) that it is aimed at people with a sense of humor.  By the way Jeff Willis, it's spelled amoeba not ""ameba."" Oh and yes we can really see the intelligence in the review titled ""AAAAAAAAAAWWWFFFFFFUUUUUUUULLLLL,"" Where we basically have the sentence ""Will is not funny"" repeated 5 times. Plus we see the well developed vocabulary when the self proclaimed ""movie master"" (Nerd alert!) says Ferrell is ""so F*ckin lame."" So to all of you out there, if you're looking for a good flick and a lot of laughs then check this one out. With one of the greatest Saturday Night Live veterans out there, plus cameos from an all-star lineup including Jack Black, Luke Wilson, and Ben Stiller, You won't be disappointed if you're looking for good old fashioned comedy . This one's a keeper. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to feed my pet amoeba.",1122854400,13,1089,4.61340206185567
2156998,1,B00061QK0W,"This abhorrent movie verifies what I've been thinking a long time-that so-called comedy writers get so coked-up (not Coca Cola if you get the drift) that even grocery lists would be fall on the floor funny. Who in the hell greenlighted this lame thing? Probably a coked-up producer.

The title name is not funny, the idea is not funny, Will Ferrell is NOT funny, not pretty to look at (white, fat, flabby, hairy, eyes too close together!)and the movie is nothing more than one very long sexual harrassment joke from the 70's. Having worked in that era and constantly being groped and dirty joked by co-workers who were stuntedly developed as horny 14 year olds, why would I want to relive that? I tried to watch it on HBO, but after 10 minutes, there was nothing new to see. This is just one more reason Hollywood box office receipts are taking a huge hit this year.",1122422400,6,866,4.551282051282051

2157004,1,B00061QK0W,"I didn't like this movie.  I wanted to like it, and I watched the whole thing, but I still didn't get it.

First, having lived through the 70's, I can tell you that it ws not lived as though life was a porn movie set.  However, with the over the top hair and suits, it sure seemed to me that Will Ferrell (who co-wrote this movie) has the idea that Boogie Nights is a definitive picture showing the 1970's.  The entire movie seemed to be ripped off from Boogie Nights and the Beastie Boys video for 'Sabotage.'  The pool scene where Ferrell does the cannonball - right from Boogie Nights.  The girls running around - I don't think so. Gee, start playing some awful music and see what happens?  If this was a running joke, it didn't seem to be funny.

I don't understand Will Ferrell.  I know many people think he is HILARIOUS.  I don't.  I guess what bothered me about this movie is that from the start it doesn'it decide what it is doing.  Is it being played straight so the audience laughs -- no.  Is it being played as camp by the cast so we all laugh - not really.  Is it just unfunny - to me, yes.  If you appreciate overacting this is a movie for you.  Personally, I didn't need to see a male erection in the movie - what was the point (he liked the girl?).  If you want such comedy, I recommend the far more hilarious Steve Martin movie 'The Man With Two Brains (1983).'  Now, that is funny.  Here, it seems as though Mr. Ferrell is just utlizing a comic persona as one big Saturday Night sketch.  In fact the entire movie seems as though it is a SNL sketch without network censor constraints. This movie could't even get San Diego right.  For crying out loud, the buildings are all contemporary, and definitely not 1970's style.  Sheesh.  Could they have used a 1970's era shot of the city?  What was with the charecters.  The cowboy sports reporter - an overrated version of Don Meredith (way too over the top).  The weather guy ( a slow bus rider) is too stupid for comedy.  However, in the movie he supplies the best laughs with his comment ' LOUD NOISES.'  Yes, that was funny.  His pick up lines on Christina Applegate's charecter were funny as well, I have to say.  Paul Rudd's charecter, I didn't understand.  Frankly, the movie just didn't go anywher.  Kinda funny enough to keep you watching hoping for more laughs that never come.  Pleasure Town as an animated sketch - call the TBS boys - not funny.

If your like me, you can appreciate comedy. I can appreciate stupid comedy movies.  I loved Dodgeball - that is a funny movie.  Here, it is obvious Will Ferrell is a dreadfully unfunny comedian.  His comedy is insipid, unfunny and uninspired.  He is a mediocre talent ( I don't mean to be so harsh, but it is my review).  He can be mildly amusing, and at times funny - at times. However, my Aunt Edna can be funny at times as well - she isn't on tv or in the movies. It is sad to me that our standards are so low that Will Ferrell is seen as some major talent.  He is not, but he is LAUGHING ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK.

If you under 21, you may find this movie to be great , and that is wondeful for you.  If you think One Night at the Roxbury is a very funny movie, then this movie may be for you.  However, if you like to really laugh, then I think this movie is a waste of time.  Mr. Ferrell cannot act at all.  I cannot fathom if he is camp, or more likely just so bad of an actor that his charecter doesn't exist.  Either way, why give this movie  your time.  Rent Handball, or anything else for that matter.",1109980800,9,3531,4.207772795216742
2157005,2,B00061QK0W,"This is a pretty funny movie that succeeds because it seems to fly in the face of political correctness.  I thought ""wow, he must be getting feminists really angry with this film"" and it was nice to think of Ferrell as being free from the Hollywood requirement to think alike.  Then he throws in a useless and cliched jab at President Bush at the end (I am no fan of Bush) and I lost all respect for him.  It was like he did not have the guts to fully carry out this assault on political correctness and let his fans down in the end in order to kowtow to the very people he mocks the whole movie. It reminded me of the racists who say ""well i am not a racist since I have a black friend.""  Pathetic.",1108944000,,699,4.043478260869565
2157006,5,B00061QK0W,"Everything about this movie is funny.  Will Ferrell, Steven Corell, everybody else (almost every working comedian of any worth is either in it), the deleted scenes, the bonus movie (this version comes with a bonus movie fashioned from deleted scenes), etc.), the commentary with Lou Rawls, EVERYTHING.  Sure, the plot is probably lacking compared to say Sideways or whatever is considered to be witty and clever lately.  Maybe that movie is good AND has a plot, I don't know, I haven't seen it.  I do know that Anchorman is definitely funnier and it doesn't even have a plot.

Will Ferrell is always entertaining and humorous but I thought the plot fell flat.  To me, the chauvinism of the news team was bogus and unrealistic.  Of course, as is the case in everything Hollywood puts out, the female lead (Applegate) has all of the talent and the men around her are just dumb fools.  Such a view is merely misandric fantasy and I, for one, am tired of men being portrayed as oxes on film.  It's worth seeing but I did not think it was great.",1106352000,,588,4.398148148148148

I'm not sure what the problem is -- maybe its the fact that instead of being totally ridiculous, they're trying to sneak some kind of moral or something into the story, but it just doesn't work. And I think the lewdness gets to be a hindrance of just about every buildup to a joke.
