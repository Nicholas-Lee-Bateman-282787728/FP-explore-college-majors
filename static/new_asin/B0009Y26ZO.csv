8070012,5,B0009Y26ZO,For those who are fans of David McCallum - Illya Kuryakin from The Man From UNCLE - this is a must see.  He demonstrates his skill to take on a controversial role and turn it into one hysterically funny movie!!,1396656000,,210,4.25
8070013,4,B0009Y26ZO,"Basic romantic comedy.  Actually, I take that back, as the basic romantic comedy is usually bordering on horrendous piece of tripe.  This one is enjoyable and worthy of repeated watchings; however, I can't be trusted.  Because this movie provides one of the few opportunities to gaze upon the gorgeousness that is Isaach de Bankole without having to follow a distressing plot, I'm unable to be truly impartial here.

It's this simple.  If you like light-hearted rom coms that aren't overly schmaltzy, you'll probably like this one.",1239840000,2,531,5.127906976744186
8070014,5,B0009Y26ZO,What a fun film. Indies are the best. Shalom Harlow is wonderful in the part of a very naive 20 something. The cast especially the magnificent David McCallum as her uncle's lover are just right together. This film should have gotten wide release. It's beautiful funny and a great script. The production company did a journal during the making of the film. According to the producers they had loads of stuff for the dvd if it was ever released. What a shame the dvd distributor didn't get in touch with them.  Wish I could give it more stars,1139875200,8,540,4.510204081632653

8070016,4,B0009Y26ZO,"I have no idea what the makers of this film were thinking when they titled this film. But despite the horribly cliched title this film is funny, charming and romantic. I would reccommend it to any romantic movie fan because I don't think that this film will disappoint!!",1123027200,8,270,4.645833333333333
