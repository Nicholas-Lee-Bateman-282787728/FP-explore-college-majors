8277402,5,B001AH0IBI,"I wanted something updated but in the classic Firm style.  This workout features the legendary Susan Harris alone, which I find less distracting than a room full of exercisers. The choreography is as smart as all of Anna Benson's and employs weights and compound movements to keep the heart rate up without being dancey or hard to follow. I suggest going through it without weights once so you can gauge your weights, which will determine the intensity of the workout.  The video itself isn't HD but it also isn't fuzzy or hard to see.  Great to have in a rotation or to use every other day as a one and only.",1436140800,3,609,4.468468468468468
8277403,5,B001AH0IBI,"I recently purchased this,as well as FitPrime Floor Burn starring Susan and gave both 5 stars! I am a new fan of the Classic Firm workouts(1-4 I love)and Susan is my favorite of the Firm instructors. I am an at home workout fanatic and have quite an extensive collection but now that I'm 48 and have had several injuries,I need workouts that are easier on my joints. This was not an easy workout but there wasn't the constant jumping found in many other workouts. For a workout under an hour,I felt very worked and sweaty,yet not wiped out. I highly recomend this!",1431993600,5,564,4.53921568627451
8277404,5,B001AH0IBI,"I LOVE this tape. Some people have made comments that the production values are not like the old Firm tapes. While it's not as fancy as the old Firm days, the workout is great. Better than the new Firm workouts in my opinion. It's fast and you don't need a lot of room. I loved the music and you can't get any better than Susan Harris and Anna Benson teaming up together. I will be returning to this one again and again.",1430006400,2,420,4.134146341463414
8277405,1,B001AH0IBI,Great workout but very poor recording.  I question whether this is a bootlegged copy or not. The workout is classic firm quality.  Too bad it's grainy and blurry.,1383609600,3,162,4.75
8277406,5,B001AH0IBI,"I have oodles of exercise DVD's.  It is hard to find one that works for your individual taste.  This one fits the bill.  A very nice overall workout, that doesn't appear to damage any ""older"" joints.  I love Susan Harris and wished she had more",1274054400,9,244,4.355555555555555
