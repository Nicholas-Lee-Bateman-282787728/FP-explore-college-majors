6787527,3,B00P4FU74K,"Let me say, first of all, that I am a huge huge huge MASH fan. This show is iconic, and is one of the best TV shows the US has ever put out. I used to watch the show on Netflix, and loved having it at my fingertips. Netflix removed it, and I was forced to look into buying the DVD's. After looking at many different options, I went with this bulk set. Partly for the convenience of getting the whole series in one purchase, and partly for the price, as this was cheaper than buying all of the seasons individually. Now if I was just rating the show, it would get the full 5-stars. For this set, I had to knock off 2 for the sheer annoyance of having to select every single episode you want to watch. Normally, in my experience, when you pop in a disc, you have the option to ""play all,"" and when selected it simply auto-plays from one ep to the next. Well this set isn't formatted that way. There's no option to ""play all,"" so after each and every episode, you have to go back to the main menu to select the next one. You think this wouldn't be that big of a deal, but let me tell you, it's super annoying. It's gets even more annoying over time the more you have to do it. If I had it to do over, I would buy a different set, or get the individual seasons as I read those do have the ""play all"" function.",1493683200,86,1305,4.003831417624521
6787528,5,B00P4FU74K,"This was a wonderful buy!! All DVDs played perfectly bought it for my husband's birthday!  He loves it! Received it a bit later than we were supposed to, but, it was worth it!!",1490400000,2,176,4.333333333333333
6787529,4,B00P4FU74K,"I think 1 dvd froze for a second but other than that everything worked fine. On the negative side if you like a lot of extras on your dvd sets you have the wrong set. All you get is the episodes, nothing else.",1488412800,12,209,3.883720930232558

6787540,1,B00P4FU74K,"Strongly advise that you not buy this product. Episodes in the first few seasons locked up or would not play. By season 5, the disc would not even load. Of course, Amazon's return policy says you must return for refund within 30 days. Who watches 11 seasons of a TV show in 30 days? That's absurd. I escalated this within Amazon's customer service group and got very polite assurances that they had done all they could. Amazon provided a partial refund and did not even offer a replacement. They referred me to foxconnect.com, though Amazon's web site says that the provider was CG Movies and Games. In short, the product was defective and no one takes responsibility for it. I am extremely disappointed - particularly as a very loyal Amazon Prime member. I had seen a few online reviews of this series, suggesting poor disc quality, but none of the reviews indicated Amazon as the source. I expected a higher level of quality assurance from Amazon.",1476403200,70,949,4.72289156626506
