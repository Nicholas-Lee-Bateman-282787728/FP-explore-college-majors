8514870,3,B007D1J6EU,"Very illustrative, if not superficial. There are no preparation exercises and detailed, step-by-step, demonstration of each movements, including separate training of arms and legs technique further combined into the whole one for each specific fist. Ignoring of internal power phenomena is also detrimental to the whole content of this DVD. All supposed health and martial art benefits are reduced to so called ""correct body mechanics"". This constant ""demistifying"" of the art does not serve the purpose of this DVD. All in all this material looks as very basic and, as such, cannot be used as a full scale learining aid for mastering the art. Sorry about that.",1437955200,2,661,5.186915887850467
