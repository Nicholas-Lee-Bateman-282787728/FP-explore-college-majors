5772868,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,The movie is not as good as the original was but it good for the younger generation.  I wish I could have seen more of the original character.,1391644800,,142,4.071428571428571
5772869,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,Great Movie House Party : Tonight 's The Night  this House party is kind a like the other House Party that i love,1384300800,,113,3.9130434782608696
5772870,4,B00D3RQQ9Q,"This was a nice spin on an old classic! We were skeptical about renting this on redbox at first, especially after House Party 4(What a catastrophe!) but after seeing that Kid n Play had their hand in this we decided to give it a shot and I'm glad we did. It's the same scenario where a teen and friend throw a party while the parents are away and things get out of hand. Classic school yard characters such as a hot girl who's taken by the jock who's a jerk, nerdy kids, a shy fat girl, wannabes, and also a busty neighbor who's also a shameless cooger. Light cursing, nothing worse than what real high school kids actually talk like and some sexual refrences but a good movie in all and some pretty funny moments to go with it.",1381190400,,728,4.244604316546763
5772871,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,"Loved the movie. Great fun. Would highly recommend it. It was a great production was fun to work on. Fun, fun, fun!!!",1378339200,,117,4.363636363636363
5772872,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,HILARIOUS!!! Especially that Victoria Meyer! Love the whole cast! Have watched five times! Tell everybody. It's good to laugh. Great music and dancing too!,1377734400,3,155,5.5
5772873,3,B00D3RQQ9Q,"This movie isn't bad by any means. It's not great either. The fact that the movie has ""House Party"" in the title and has Kid N Play on the cover is misleading. *Spoiler alert.......Kid N Play don't even appear until the ending credits. This movie is a comedy but I really didn't laugh all that much. It was OK.Three stars might be generous but it's light years better than House Party 4. I won't bother to describe the movie. Nothing new was done here. I rented it for 5 bucks on Comcast. Not really worth more than that.",1375833600,,521,4.326530612244898
5772874,4,B00D3RQQ9Q,House Party genre continues. Dancing highlights include the brilliant dancing of one Tristin Mays. 2 words: Ankle Gun... She also plays the Love interest to the little brother from Everybody Hates Chris. Highlight of the movie as the rest of the plot is basically the same,1375142400,3,272,4.934782608695652
5772875,4,B00D3RQQ9Q,Hey the film is atypical house party but the dancing was incredible and the music was excellent but looks like they aren't bringing a soundtrack album out which is a real shame as i know a lot of people who would buy the music for some of the mixes they did that's why i only give it 4 as WB have missed a trick here by not releasing a soundtrack,1374883200,3,346,3.9571428571428573

8589168,1,B00D3RQQ9Q,"I don't liked , it's a poor quality.
I want my money back because I can't watch this ...
Thank you",1491523200,,98,3.7142857142857144
8589169,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,Good movie,1466467200,,10,4.5
8589170,2,B00D3RQQ9Q,Movie was corny,1455753600,,15,4.333333333333333
8589171,1,B00D3RQQ9Q,"Welp it looks like they've finally hit rock bottom and completely white washed the ""House Party"" name. This movie is filled with nothing but a bunch of light skin or racially ambiguous, or just flat out white characters. If you're from the House Party I, II, or even III era's then you're going to hate this movie. I don't know who they are trying to appeal to... maybe the Hannah Montana/Disney audience? It's not funny at all, the ""rapping"" is weak at best, and overly used slang from all of these suburban looking kids was extremely annoying. This movie just sucks basically.",1446249600,3,578,4.676470588235294
8589172,4,B00D3RQQ9Q,not too bad... decent movie,1428278400,,27,4.6
8589173,4,B00D3RQQ9Q,"If you liked the originals than you'll enjoy this. Yes it's not amazing and you get a brief kid n play cameo. It's all about a house party! It's about having pre adult fun, we the adults are away the kids will play.",1424304000,,215,4.023255813953488
8589174,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,Very good movie. I bought it for my son. He love it!!! Good service!!,1420329600,,69,4.0
8589175,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,Came quick and loved it! Thank You!,1405814400,,35,4.142857142857143
8589176,5,B00D3RQQ9Q,"HOUSE PARTY V: TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT turns out to be the best sequel to HOUSE PARTY that ever happened - and a lovely comedy with enough raunch, laughs and romance to turn any night into HOUSE PARTY night. The acting is very funny, the script is absolutely brilliant and funny and even touching when it turns towards more serious gritty matters.  This is a keeper - they should do more HOUSE PARTY movies with the same writer - slam dunk!  Kick step!",1399507200,,448,4.451219512195122
