8243867,5,B00124SNFC,"""One of the funniest films I've ever seen"" is easier said than understood because there are different opinions about what is funny. Perhaps comparisons can be helpful. In my opinion ""Wakeful Nights"" has a humour quite similar to Kitano's ""Getting Any ?"" and Sabu's ""Monday"". Both I find extremely funny, therefore I refer to ""Wakeful Nights"" as being indeed one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Perfect timing, brilliant ensemble cast. The script can't be beaten. For admirers of the absurd. By the way, excellently subtitled (as always).",1444348800,,543,5.112359550561798

8243869,5,B00124SNFC,"Very funny but the humor might be a bit much for some people.  Rather raunchy - says something that in the ""making of"" portion they say most of the jokes and stories gathered from geisha and others could not be used as they were a bit too raunchy to put on screen.",1363737600,,264,4.076923076923077
8243870,2,B00124SNFC,"This is a movie targeting the adult mature audience, as I believe the term of art is, the Japanese adult matures however.  As such, I don't think that it will have much cross over appeal to the western audience.  For, it is slow moving and relies upon the audience's knowledge of Japanese vernacular speech.  The sets, however, are wonderful stylized set pieces which depict 'traditional' Japanese homes, restaurants,shrines, etc., and as such may be worth the look for these alone.
It is likely that the director took such care with these traditional set pieces because the movie itself is set around a traditional story-telling artform known as 'Rakugo.'  This is actually what makes the film so clever, for the dialogue depends upon the audience catching on to the numerous double entendre, and other cultural signifiers (for instance, one musn't eat a certain type of food at a Wake because it signifies joy, etc.).  Much of this will go over the heads of a non-Japanese audience, even though the producers of this dvd did thoughtfully add sub-sub-titles which attempt to explain the nuances.
The story itself revolves around the serial deaths of members of a troupe of Rakugo performers and subsequent events at which stories are told (Rakugo about Rakugo artists).  As I said, much of this is aimed at the adult mature audience, quite a bit of the stories are raunchy/crude and they are likely to shock and perhaps offend many viewers.
I would watch this only for the wonderful sets and to witness stylized Japanese rituals which are utterly foreign to occidental cultures (although I haven't witnessed an Irish Wake....so perhaps not all occidental cultures).",1250553600,,1666,5.018115942028985
8243871,4,B00124SNFC,"If there is such a thing as sophisticated potty humor, than this is it.  I don't know if I have ever seen a filthier movie pulled off with such style and substance, maintaining the delicate balance between the high and the low, the sacred and the profane. A comedy set around death and dying is nothing new, bringing to mind Itami Juzo's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Funeral/dp/B00000IREH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Funeral</a>, but this is done in an entirely different, and outrageous, style.  And there is a dancing corpse.

The jokes, some of which I blush to recall (and I never blush) are clever word-play rather than simple sight gags, that had me laughing so hard I had to pause the movie just to get it all out.  The Japanese love their body humor, and aren't afraid to find giggles in the toilet, but this is no Eddie Murphy flick with the funniest bit being a fart and a fat person.  This is comedy set in the world of rakugo, professional comedic storytellers that are as much a part of the venerable and traditional Japanese theater tradition as Kabuki and Noh.

As the story begins, a master storyteller lies in his deathbed, and his disciples gather around him to ease his passage.  Offering to fulfill his final wish, they lean forward to hear what the master has to say.  His voice is faint, but he manages to whisper out that he would like to see a...oh yes, exactly what you are thinking.  A nice juicy honey pot. And from there it only gets better, or worse depending on your perspective.

""Wakeful Nights"" has an impressive cast, all famous faces and pros of the Japanese film industry such as Sasano Takashi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-and-Honor/dp/B00116FOOO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love and Honor</a>), Nakai Kiichi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/When-the-Last-Sword-Is-Drawn/dp/B000BQ5J18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">When the Last Sword Is Drawn</a>) and Kinoshiita Houka (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shinobi-Heart-Under-Blade/dp/B000HXDWOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shinobi - Heart Under Blade</a>).  Director Tsugawa Masahiko is making his first film here, but he is an experienced actor who knows his way around a camera.  The movie is a bit uneven, moving from pure riots of hilarity to sudden slowdowns of seriousness that are well done but leave you hungry for the next burst of comedy.  There isn't much here by way of sub-plots and character development, which is missed, even in the face of such stellar laughs.

This DVD by Animeigo deserves extra props as well.  Because so much of the humor in ""Wakeful Nights"" is based on naughty puns and double-meanings in the Japanese language, the subtitles do extra duty translating the cultural elements above and the regular dialog below.  I could imagine this might be a touch annoying to someone just looking to shut their brains off and enjoy a flick, but anyone who is interested in Japanese language and /or culture will find this a treasure trove. Also, along with the usual features, like deleted scenes and such, there is a fantastic sing-along section for the tunes in the dirty-song contest feature in the movie.  Rarely have I seen such an original and fun bonus feature, which means you spend a long time playing with the disk after the movie is over.",1217203200,3,3428,5.499047619047619
