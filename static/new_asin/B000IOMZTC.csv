8147117,4,B000IOMZTC,"I had heard of Lama Surya Das, but had never seen him. He is a bit of a bear of man with a New York accent and a fun attitude. He takes a light hearted approach to meditation and while some of his joking may seem a bit dated, his sunny delivery more than makes up for it. He seems like the kind of guy you would love to have a beer with at the local watering hole. The DVD isn't long, 30 minutes, but it is adequate to deliver his message, explanations, and introduction to dzogchen. The methods are so easy and inviting anybody can do them. There is an eyes open meditation, skygazing, chanting the Dali Lama's mantra Om Mani Padme Hum, and some explanations and hints to assist the meditation process. I suggest if you are interested in doing mantra meditation including this one, you might want to use a mala or prayer beads. Don't feel obligated to get anything expensive. If you are crafty there are instructions on the internet on making your own mala and even crocheting and knitting malas. Usually there are 108 counting beads plus 1 ""guru"" bead. If you want a shorter mala you can use 54+1 or 27+1 beads. There are videos on YouTube explaining how to use a mala. The Hindus do not cross the guru bead, many Buddhists do, in my mind just follow your preference as it is saying the mantra with your heart more than messing with the mala that makes the difference. I have found the mala helps me to keep on track chanting. I enjoyed this DVD and only wished I could have spent more time meditating with Lama Surya Das. Perhaps if Sounds True updates this DVD they can add a session or MP3 of 108 chants of Om Mani Padme Hum. This same DVD is also listed as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Natural-Meditation/dp/1591793114/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Natural Meditation</a>&nbsp;with a slightly different price. As of the date of this review I was able to find about an 8 minute sample from this DVD on YouTube you can view before deciding to purchase.",1332201600,3,1999,4.681818181818182
8147118,5,B000IOMZTC,"A wonderful 30 minute transmission from one of America's most loved Buddhist teachers. Lama Surya Das
offers these teachings that are fully accessible to any and all. With humor and genuine teaching skill, he brings these esoteric Tibetan teachings into the contemporary world. A blessing.",1211760000,6,289,5.444444444444445
8147119,4,B000IOMZTC,"This is a short (30 minute) video with a 7-page booklet presenting a full Dzogchen meditation session including mantras, breathing exercises, dedication, etc. The video & sound quality are very good & important points are annotated on the screen. The scenery (Arapaho/Roosevelt National Forest) is lovely as is the background music from ""Songs of Peace."" Das (formerly Jeffrey Miller) is a Western Buddhist who translates Eastern teachings into easily assimilated works (e.g. best-seller ""Awakening the Buddha Within"").

As usual Das integrates humor into his offering, saying, ""Dzogchen is more fun"" & demonstrating the ""user friendly mantra ""Ah,"" & with Buddhist prayers nobody's listening. He seems to define ""Natural Meditation"" differently than in his ""Natural Radiance"" book/CD set. Much of this video well-addresses Dzogchen Sky Gazing, which most authors merely mention. But he describes it as a ""metaphor for inner infinite space"" reminiscent of a Zen blank wall--which CAN be used if there are no windows nearby.

Of course, he describes the Dzogchen View: ""Let It Be"" (sounds like the Beatles to me!), mingling heaven & earth/inner & outer--a natural flow, & emphasizes quality of presence vs. quantity of time: Dzogchen in many small moments. This makes Dzogchen ""totally integratable with daily modern life."" Furthermore, one can p. 5 ""continually open your heart & mind, & to radiate outward toward all beings who need the spiritual energy you have to give."" Sounds true to me.

8147120,5,B000IOMZTC,"Lama Surya Das always makes everything sound so simple in his books. In this video, he demonstrates just how easy meditation is. Lama Surya Das takes you step by step through a simple (but powerful) daily meditation. The practice is called ""Natural Great Perfection"" and the video will have you practicing like a pro-even if you've never been to a meditation class. It is suitable for beginners and the more experienced. Lama has a great sense of humor and a practical, common sense approach to meditation. I highly recommend this video to one and all.",1094947200,7,552,4.821052631578947
