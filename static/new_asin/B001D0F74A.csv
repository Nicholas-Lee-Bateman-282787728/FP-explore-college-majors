3521090,2,B001D0F74A,Okay for the Duke Ellington-like fans but did not really have much recognizable rock and roll.  I was looking for more Chuck Berry type music.,1393459200,,142,4.68
3521091,5,B001D0F74A,"I watched the program with my family the other night, and we loved it.  Live Ellington!  Nat King Cole ( the Trio.  With Oscar Moore.  None of this Mona Lisa jive)!  Big Joe Turner!

My 16 year old asked why is it the Rock 'n' Roll Revue  if it has all this jazz, which gave me an opening to teach him about the history of rock, the importance of Joe Turner, and how he sang Shake Rattle and Roll years before Elvis did.  When we were driving in the car a couple days later, another Joe Turner song came on, and this time he listened to the song, because this show gave him the background to appreciate it.

All said, and these 5 stars are for the fantastic music, there is a big 10 minute hole in the middle of some godawful ""comedy"" with jokes that were old back when this was filmed 60 years ago.  Just fast forward if you can't watch that.",1391990400,2,843,4.085365853658536
8290659,1,B001D0F74A,They've had years to fix the labeling of this title and haven't done so - so you can draw your own conclusions.  All other versions are honest and say it's 37 minutes - only Synergy has this bogus time label.,1522800000,,208,4.2
8290660,4,B001D0F74A,Great performances by classic musicians.  The MC is a cornball guy who is a distraction and the quality of the video is fair to poor. Worth watching if you overlook the quality issues.,1455580800,,184,4.575757575757576
8290661,5,B001D0F74A,Really good music program,1446940800,,25,5.5
8290662,3,B001D0F74A,It is ok.,1444867200,,9,2.3333333333333335
8290663,3,B001D0F74A,"Okay, but disappointing since they had some talented stars, but the songs that were presented could have been some of the more popular ones that the stars recorded.  The music that was chosen was simply not my taste.",1438214400,,216,4.684210526315789
8290664,3,B001D0F74A,This show's title is misleading. It's not really about rock and roll.  It's mostly jazz and early rhythym and blues.,1437177600,,116,4.8
8290665,4,B001D0F74A,"I loved it, but more for historians.",1433721600,,36,4.285714285714286
8290666,1,B001D0F74A,"Beware..! Do NOT buy the ""Synergy Entertainment"" version f this dvd. It is a shameless rip-off. At least half of the movie is missing. The dvd runs for 37 minutes despite amazon's claim that it runs for 75 minutes. The dvd box states that it runs for 1 hr and 15 minutes but that is a lie. Many artists shown on the poster (Lionel Hampton, Ruth brown, etc..) are simply not there. I knew something was up when I helD the DVD-R up to the light and saw that only about a third of the disc space was written on.. This is a cool all-black variety show but do NOT buy the dvd from Synergy. You'll be sorry you did. Get it from another distributor.. Alpha or Something Weird Video (if they still stock it).",1426291200,,700,4.192592592592592
8290667,1,B001D0F74A,"good 30's and 40's music, but NOT R&R",1420416000,,37,3.75
8290668,3,B001D0F74A,The picture & sound quality was average for the age of this video.  The production of this video for this time period was good as were the groups in this revue!  I enjoyed this video!,1404086400,,183,4.2
