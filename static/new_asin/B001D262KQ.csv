3522164,1,B001D262KQ,"I just had to make this review as a public service announcement as to how bad and deceptive this movie is.  I saw a trailer that made the movie look pretty good.  I went and saw all the Ghost House Underground series and they were all packaged nicely, promoted well, and many looked promising.  I took a chance on this thinking at the very least it would be a decent gore film.

What you get is an obscenely low budget dubbed italian film which is boring, plodding, and has little in the form of character building, plot, or logic.  Even the 2-3 gore scenes are just your typical run of the mill effects a teenager could have made at home.  Do not buy this.

I'm a big horror fan and am used to the low budget films.  I own plenty of those 50 or 20 movies for 10 bucks sets and that is where this movie belongs.  It is simply not at any level where it should be packaged or sold on its own.  It looks like it was shot 30 years ago too.  If you want cheesy bad films, go for one of those cheap sets.  If you want good italian horror - rewind 30 or more years and explore Argento or Fulci's best work.",1253059200,3,1099,4.037037037037037

I know this hasn`t even dawned on most of you, what with meager English skills that have been even further reduced by all that texting you do (usually while driving), but give it a try sometime, you might be surprised at what the film director actually tried to convey sublimely, instead of expecting to be beaten over the head with a dull plot device designed for seven year olds...I apologize for the intentionally inflammatory remarks, but we Americans have become imbiciles when it comes to cinema - mea culpa.",1250812800,,987,4.5195530726256985

3522168,4,B001D262KQ,"Basically a somewhat serious, psychological story of an insane family of murderer-cannibals and a number of their victims. Sometimes, ridiculously over-dramatic, but it has staying power. I'm upset!

I hear the english dubbing isn't so great, but I watched it today in italian, (with subtitles), so I wouldn't know. The Ghosthouse Underground DVD gives you a choice.

Not the most mature work in the world, but very sick and unusual. Also, considerably more depressing then most of the gaillos and 70's horror movies that the filmmakers say inspired it. Silly in a sense, but it really goes all out. Kind of a combination of a junk horror movie and what a particularly, emotional Tennessee Williams play might seem like on drugs.

Not without merit. Also, not a good movie for little kids.",1235952000,5,789,4.962121212121212

It has been said by many others on here, but please listen:  DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP!  I'm not some movie snob and can usually appreciate most bad low budget films...but not this one.  I almost stopped the DVD player to chunk this crap DVD straight into the garbage can!  This is some of the worst acting I have ever tried to watch.  The people who created this trash should be ashamed to have their names associated with it.  This is supposed to be a horror film ,but it is not scary.  There are a group of thugs in the movie that drive around finding women to rape.  They sit in the car telling each other what they want to do to a woman or how horny they are.  All the while using the worst voice actors ever.  Then there are these guys wearing really bad make-up to look like hillbillies. I wish I could post pictures of this here.  How could they think people would be frightened by this crap?  I have seen amateur films posted on youtube that are better than this.  oh and by the way, also stay away from another Ghost House Pictures release, Brotherhood of Blood.

3522170,3,B001D262KQ,"Let's get something out of the way, first.  If you love the current crop of Hollywood garbage that passes for horror; you know that mindless, artless, rehashed drivel that exists merely as edifices from which to hang tons of special effects and jump scare per minute with little to no atmosphere, then I suggest you stop reading this review right now because I guarantee that you will hate The Last House In The Woods.  Now, allow me to follow up my introductory statement with this and that is if you're over 40 years of age and remember going to the movies to see the greats of 70's and 80's slasher films, especially the Italian giallo and horror of Bava, Argento and Fulci, then I think you will enjoy this movie considerably.  Far from perfect and its budget evident in every respect, especially that cheesy score, this little shocker is for the most part very effective and executed relatively well, some over-wrought acting notwithstanding.  No, it's not terribly original, with some desperate ideas thrown into the mixture for obvious reasons, but what it lacks in polish or freshness it made up for with sheer enthusiasm and fleet footed direction.  There's some unusual camera work that gives the film a kind off-kilter quality that I liked, almost oppressive at times suggesting encroaching madness.  Some set pieces were especially effective, including the young Julio chomping down on a bloody leg that rests on an immaculate white tablecloth all the while his freakish family looks on with twisted delight.  The film plays out more often than not like homage to many of the films by aforementioned giants of Italian horror and in that sense may across as derivative in many ways, but that's okay because as far as I was concerned, the results were more than satisfying",1231718400,,1782,4.861386138613861
3522171,1,B001D262KQ,"DO NOT BUY/RENT IT FOR THE GORE! IT IS EXTREMELY CHEAP AND USUALLY OFF CAMERA!

this movie is horrible. its obviously shot on digital. the acting is seriously some of the worst ive ever seen,especially the english dubbing. the lighting effects are all off(you can usually tell they're on a set) most gore moments happen off screen, and when they do its some of the cheapest, least believable effects ive ever seen. some effects litterally looked like mustard and milk. if you want a somewhat by-the-numbers horror flick with a lot of blood, look elsewhere, theres plenty of enjoyably simple bloodbaths out there, and this isn't one of them. you cant take one second of this movie seriously. its just too cheap in every way to be even worth a rental.

if it really matters its the story of 2 people who, while trying to escape some thugs, seek refuge in the home of a seemingly trustworthy couple to find out they would've been much better of with the bullies. TCM style hillbillies/cannibalism ensues and they try to survive. just watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre again if you want some rednecks kill people scenario.

and i considered a lot of the After Dark 8 films to die for collections to be half decent. that tells you just how horrible this is. if you want simple bloody horror, any of these would be a much better choice:

Inside, High Tension, Black Seep, Botched, Dark Ride, any TCM except Next Generation(ugh!), The Signal, Friday the 13th part 1-4, Wrong Turn 1 or 2, Boogeyman 2, See No Evil, Saws, Hostels, any Romero zombie flick is a great choice, Automaton Transfusion (despite horrible camera work. its a blood bath) hell.. i could go on and on. don't even bother with this one.",1226275200,2,1693,4.671140939597316

3522176,3,B001D262KQ,"If you want to get me excited, drop the name Sergio Stivaletti into a conversation. I know his special effects are not always perfect, but he believes in getting his hands VERY dirty and his physical effects always satisfy my lust for Eurohorror thrills. So, I was shocked to see the recent Ghost House Underground DVD, The Last House In The Woods, includes his name as not only effects man but also as a producer.
I needed to see it...just as soon as someone returned the sole copy at the rental shop. I lucked out and grabbed this up, and I can say that it certainly does warrant a rent from any Italian horror fanatic. A classic? No. A splatterfest? At times... A throwback to the glory years? A bit.

Il Bosco fuori (The Forest Outside) starts off in classic euroTRASH fashion as a family gets trapped on a lonely road, only to end up getting smashed (literally) and pummelled to death. Dad and mum go down in front of their son...but what happens to the little boy that sees the Giallo Killer?
It ain't pretty...

After the engaging start, things meander as we meet our protaganists, Aurora and Rino. She is pretty and likes to draw with crayons while Rino gives her the what for. Sure. Rino however...well, he comes off as a fairly pathetic loser that can't get his head around the inevitable break up. The pair go off on a lonely road to talk and have more senseless, and off screen, sex.

Of course, while crayon gal and Mr. Please Take Me Back are chatting we meet three idjits that tripped over a few decades and fell out of Demons. They are just looking for some action and find our emotionally conflicted friends. They try to rape the girl, but are stopped as a passing motorist threatens to kill them. The motorists seem so nice...they offer to help the pair out. Rino got a beating and needs a little rest.

A shame that their house is way out in the woods. And their son is wearing the kid dentures from Phenomena!! Oh, and the pair are ooky...really ooky. AND...they keep some deformed dudes with chainsaws on the property.

Now, we could go on with the plot, but once you get to the chainsaws I'm both sold and happy.
Director Gabriele Albanesi has his heart in the right place and his blood bib firmly secured so that Stivaletti gets to work plenty of his particular magic. The gore flows as chainsaw dismemberments, gunshots and stiff beatings are passed around. And this is all good, just the Stivaletti contributions make the film worth watching. However, and perhaps this is a throwback to a large portion of 80's eurohorror, the pacing is way off. It is really slow (instead of suspenseful) for a good stretch. But all is forgiven by the end of the 88 minutes.

Made with very little funds, you can obviously see everyone putting an extra effort in to making it a worthwhile film. It is weird that most reviews of this film I've stumbled across relate this to a Giallo. It is in no way like a giallo. This is straight up Eurotrash, more a hybrid Texas Chainsaw Massacre by way of Andrea Bianchi would be more suitable. Maybe that sounds like a backhanded compliment, but that is high praise from me. So, I can't complain.

Well, I can complain about one thing. I can't believe this was released, but THE TORTURER, directed by Lamberto Bava and even gorier than this film, is just sitting on a shelf (and Russian dvd). Somebody point Tapert and Ghost House that way please!

I did learn a lesson about the place of music in Italian horror. I can overlook many many small problems with a movie. I can overlook many big ones, such as the dubbing on the film. But MUSIC is a key ingredient. Dario Argento's horror films would not have been as good without Goblin in my mind. No way, no how, would a classical horror score helped Suspiria become the eurohorror classic it is. Even in the often maligned 80s I can name several composers that I will happily buy up on CD. Carlo Maria Cordio, Al Festa (yes, Fatal Frames guy) and Stefano Mainetti are always in my musical playlists. So, can Filippo Barbieri and Federico Bruno pull this part of the equation off?
Sort of. I loved this score-I want it on CD. Fantastic in some parts and eerie in others-it is almost a trance version of a deranged 80s horror soundtrack. However, it fails the film. The movie isn't spooky...ever. It is over the top and when you place this music beside the visuals it detracts from the intensity of the images. A shame, because the two elements stand apart very well-but don't come together for me.

So...go rent it. Enjoy seeing Sergio Stivaletti bring the pain as he usually does and take it as a tribute to an era that has perhaps gone by. I don't think I'll be going back for more, but as a one shot viewing, this is an entertaining chainsaw throwdown.",1225238400,4,4752,4.497103128621089
3522177,2,B001D262KQ,"When I got ""The Last House in the Woods"" in the mail it turned out the description on the sleeve was not for this Ghost House Underground movie but for a different one, namely ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Room-205/dp/B001D262K6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Room 205</a>.""  Since that one is about a college student moving into a haunted door room and this one has parents driving with their young boy out in the country, it was easy to tell this was not that movie.  After watching ""The Last House in the Woods"" I was wishing this had been the other movie, because despite my limited knowledge of the laws of probability I have to believe it is way better than this one, which currently has the distinction of being the worse of the six GHU films I have checked out on DVD so far this month.

Rino (Daniele Grassetti) has broken up with Aurora (Daniela Virgilio), but as he tries to get back on her good side the unlucky couple are attacked by a trio of thugs.  The good news is that the parents with their son come along, rescue the couple, and take them back to their house. But since this is clearly the last house in the woods, this is really bad news. Ultimately, what I am remind of are some of the exploitation films from the 1960s I have seen, like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizard-Of-Gore/dp/B00004S89C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizard Of Gore</a>,"" in that ""The Last House in the Woods"" is trying to provide a similar level of blood and gore.  The problem is that we are almost a half-century past that approach, so I have to wonder what is the point?  If you have never seen a good old fashioned exploitation film with buckets of blood, then this one will get you back up to speed.  But at least exploitation films were always trying to come up with some distractions, no matter how weird or inane, to justify all the blood and gore.  This one just has a single-minded ""kill, baby, kill"" mentality that is so rudimentary it is ultimately boring.

Written and directed by Gabriele Albanesi, this film's original title in Italian is ""Il Bosco fuori,"" which translates as ""The Forest Outside"" and makes no sense as the title of this particular horror film since almost all of the horror takes place in, well the last house in the woods and not outside in the forest.  The PAL version of this movie actually calls it ""Italian Chainsaw"" and that is ultimately as good a two word encapsulation of this 2006 film as you can have, and as soon as that is said I have to assume that everybody has seen better chainsaw movies, whether we are talking an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/original/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">original</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/remake/dp/B00018D44K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">remake</a>.  Yes, it is probably absurd to accuse a chainsaw movie of being inelegant, but even bad artistic pretensions are better than none.

In terms of DVD extras, the cupboard is not completely sparse here.  Albanesi provides a commentary track along with his short film ""L'Armadio"" (""The Closet""), where how the little kid acts after the ""punch line"" is revealed does not jive with his actions prior to that point.  You also have a backstage featurette and the trailer (the trailers for all of the other seven&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-House-Underground/dp/B001ECDVGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost House Underground</a>&nbsp;films are at the start of the DVD, and it is more interesting to go back and look at them after you have seen the movies to judge how well (or not) they set up these films (at which point you will learn that what they thought would be the hook for this one was something other than ""chainsaw"").",1225152000,2,3893,5.392092257001647
3522178,1,B001D262KQ,"The series from Ghosthouse Underground hasn't actually been all that bad, but no horror imprint would seem to be complete without a torture flick.  That's where this Italian horror dirge comes in, which you may wish you had left on the shelf.  Like a previous review already mentioned: there was a time when Italian horror was pretty much a sure bet to be something quite good.  The Last House in the Woods is not only proof positive that those days are long gone, it also displays that at least we horror fans here in the states aren't the only ones to have to suffer through hordes and hordes of mind-numbing, unimaginable torture flicks.  After escaping an attempted rape, a young girl (Daniela Virgilio) and her boyfriend (Daniele Grassetti) find refuge with a seemingly kindly older couple who have a very dark secret.  Soon enough, the blood and guts start to flow while torture and cannibalism become the name of the game.  While a majority of the gore effects are well-done, the film as a whole isn't frightening in the least bit, the viewer doesn't care about what happens to the characters, there's plenty of non-sensical leaps in logic, and there's horrid, uninspired direction from writer/director Gabriele Albanesi.  Worst of all, The Last House in the Woods comes off as being more boring and tired than anything else.  If you love all the Saw's and Hostel's and the like, The Last House in the Woods may be right up your alley, but for the rest of us who are tired of the torture sub-genre already, your time is much better served elsewhere.",1224720000,4,1556,4.715867158671586
3522179,2,B001D262KQ,"Once upon a time Italian horror was one of the leaders in the genre; from the 60s through about the mid to late 80s Italian horror was a massive influence on the horror genre and gave us some of most memorable and fun movies this genre ever gave us. While Italy gave us some great filmmakers a lot of the elite filmmakers weren't exactly great filmmakers such as guys like Umberto Lenzi, but they knew how to craft a fun movie. But in time filmmakers like Lenzi and Lucio Fulci started to make some really awful films and excellent filmmakers such as Sergio Martino started doing knock offs of popular American movies.

It got to the point to where anyone not named Dario Argento couldn't get funding and when they did the budget was very low and the movies suffered. Nowadays when any of these filmmakers do work their films don't get released in the States with the exception of Dario Argento. The Italian horror film as we know it is all but dead again with the exception of Argento. So with the release of The Last House in the Woods I was quite excited to see the future of Italian horror filmmakers.

But if Gabriele Albanesi is the future of Italian horror, well let's just hope it stays dead. The Last House in the Woods if not mistaken in the debut feature for Gabriele Albanesi and well he gave us a total mess of a movie. The script written by Albanesi was simply horrid! The horror genre isn't always known for great writing and in particular Italian horror, but the script here is just bad. The characters are boring and never once interesting. While they don't really say anything stupid they never say anything of importance. The script just fails at every level and really was horrible.

As director Gabriele Albanesi doesn't fair any better. The influence of such films as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Last House on the Left and The Hills Have Eyes are clearly shown. In the audio commentary Albanesi also mentions filmmakers such as Sam Raimi, Tarantino, David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick and Dario Argento as influences and well it's quite clear he didn't pay very much attention to their films. The directing is a total and utter failure on almost every possible level. Zero suspense, no scares and very poorly paced scenes. The Last House in the Woods is never boring, but it's also never once all that entertaining except a scene or two at best.

There's an attempted rape on a woman and rather than being disturbing it's laughable at how poor it is. When you mess something like that up you know you have some problems. The backwoods killers are idiotic and there is even a cannibal kid and like the attempted rape scene is laughable in how poorly done it is. A lot of scenes aim for shock value and to disturb, but never once do they reach that level.

The one thing I always loved most about Italian cinema is the visual look the films have. Even poor films were beautifully shot and well this movie the visual look is horrible. There are attempts from Albanesi to create a look in the style of Dario Argento. Note to Gabriele Albanesi; you aren't Dario Argento so please don't try to copy his style. Even in Argento's poor movies they are far better looking than this. There are scenes also with rapid camera movement in attempts to create suspense, but it looks like the camera man is going into convulsions.

In any review I write I always try and say something positive about the film and honestly sometimes that's really tough, but believe it or not there are some positives here. The one thing Gabriele Albanesi does sort of get right is this movie does have the 70s/80s exploitation vibe going for it, while it's still a terrible film he does sort of capture that vibe, but not in a good way. Also there is no CGI gore F/X and it was great see gore that wasn't CGI. The F/X was done by Sergio Stivaletti and overall they look fairly decent. I was never really a big fan of his, but he has done some solid work and some solid work with Argento who he has worked with a lot. The gore was really cool and there is a lot of the red stuff.

But don't be fooled into seeing this for the gore; once the gore starts its pretty cool for the most part, but bottom line is this; you can find movies just as gory and gorier that are far better than this. Gore can save an average movie or slightly below average movie, but gore cannot save a terrible flick like this.

In closing The Last House in the Woods is a lousy flick and its no wonder why Italian horror is dead. Even if you are a gore hound trust me skip this. Again you can find movies with far better gore that is actually entertaining.",1224633600,,4619,4.432273262661956

8291157,2,B001D262KQ,"Part of Lionsgate's eight film Ghost House Underground collection, writer/director Gabriele Albanesi's first feature film, The Last House in the Woods (2006), is a pretty gory take, on the familiar ""isolated house where evil atrocities take place"" theme.  The weird tale involves murder, kidnapping, cannibalism, dismemberment, and some very twisted love.

Shot in Italy, the film has a kind of stylized look, with some odd colors.  With lots of gore, some simplistic characterization, stiff acting, and dubbed English dialog, the movie is in some ways reminiscent of 70's style Italian horror.  The story centers on young lovers Aurora (Daniela Virgilio) and Rino (Daniele Grassetti), who are attacked by three punks high on drugs, while parked alongside a road.  Aurora is about to be subjected to some vile indignities, when a passing car stops and interrupts the proceedings.  The driver Antonio (Gennaro Diana) pulls a gun, and scares off the scumbags.  A shaken Aurora and an injured Rino, accompany Antonio and his wife Clara (Santa De Santis) back to their home, to recover from the shock.  Once there, the fun begins.

Featuring a collection of strange cartoonish characters, and some intense gore, what happens makes little sense, as cannibalism figures into a macabre family secret.  Following what seems to be a horror convention, Aurora faces danger alone after managing to make an escape from the house.  The three punks spin back into the picture, as looking for trouble they invade the house, and get much, much more than they expected.

A subtitled making of featurette, provides some insight into the backstory behind the production.  Director Albanesi displays abundant enthusiasm and pride in his project, citing a number of classic horror influences.  The film is fairly well executed, and the English dubbing is fine, although the dialog is generally terrible, and the acting rather clich&eacute;d and unpolished.  Definitely B-movie material, but those interested in retro-Eurostyle horror, with some chilling moments and ample bloodsplatter, may find this of interest.",1287878400,2,2092,5.374233128834356
8291158,2,B001D262KQ,"Two teens run into trouble off the side of the road, but the young punks that are harassing them are the least of their worries... Their would-be rescuers take them back to a house of horrors in the woods, where they are beaten and tortured by a demented family of freaks! As the familiar title indicates, LAST HOUSE is a complete throwback to the Exploitation films of the early 70's, and it is jam-packed with all of the abusive sexuality and excessive gore that the genre is known for. Many of the characters and scenes draw heavily from influences like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and (obviously) THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but when it comes time to distinguish itself from the others, it never manages to find meaning or create its own unique voice. This, combined with the weak performances and amateur direction, makes THE LAST HOUSE IN THE WOODS nothing more than a cheap imitation. It would not even be worth mentioning if it were not for the gruesome make-up and gore FX provided by Italian designer Sergio Stivaletti (DEMONS, CEMETERY MAN).

very unhappy with this movie.
it was dubbed in English, and a lot is usually lost during translations. so maybe that could be a factor.
I would not recommend this movie.",1270857600,,319,4.614035087719298
