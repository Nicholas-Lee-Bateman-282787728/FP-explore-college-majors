8422040,5,B004BMK0OO,"Really good video. Made carving a ball and claw foot really easy. See also tells you all the tools you need which was probably the most helpful thing. Most of the other stuff I could have found on YouTube, but her instructions are really good and it was well worth the money.",1483488000,,275,4.3076923076923075
8422041,5,B004BMK0OO,Excellent - Highly Recommend.  Step-by-Step instruction as Mary May carves the Ball & Claw Foot.  DVD comes with patters with which to lay out your carving.  Assumes some basic knowledge of tools and techniques.  However - this is an excellent DVD for the beginner.  As in all carving projects sharp tools and an accurate layout are the key to success.  The patterns help ensure an accurate layout.  Wonderful to watch the Ball & Claw take shape before your eyes.  Mary May has several DVDs available - and - I intend to pick them up as time - interest - and - projects dictate.,1408924800,,578,4.543689320388349
