5774434,5,B00D4C6780,"Fantastic! I am a rabid Max Fleischer fan and have been waiting for years for high quality prints of these wonderful cartoons to be released on DVD. I got Volume 1 this morning, popped it in and was very well pleased with the high quality of the image. There have been so many crummy releases of the public domain stuff over the years. We now have Fleischer's Popeye & Boop cartoons presented in the quality they deserve! I can't wait to get my grubby little mitts on the next three volumes...",1377043200,2,493,4.428571428571429
5774435,4,B00D4C6780,"This is the first legitimate DVD release of the Fleischer/Paramount Betty Boop cartoons still covered by copyright...and long overdue I might add! About 44 of the Betty Boops are in public domain and have been released by several companies on DVD, mostly using the Republic Laserdisc box sets or well used 16mm prints as their source, Olive Films has licensed 48 of the copyrighted films from Paramount and apparently is using the excellent UCLA restorations as their source material. Purists won't like it that the U.M.& M. TV logos have replaced the Paramount mountain logo on the main titles but those were apparently cut into the original negatives when U.M.& M. TV acquired the TV rights way back in the mid 1950's. Volume 1 (of 4) of this series consists of 12 cartoons, mostly from the early and best (pre-Code!) Betty Boop era. The cartoons are look terrific! No heavy noise reduction which ruined the two Republic box sets, the cartoons have never looked better since their original release in 35mm.

I'm taking one star away from my rating only because this is the typical no frills Olive release with no extras of any kind and lackluster two color carton packaging, Betty Boop really deserves some special editions with documentaries, commentaries, etc. Too bad they didn't invite cartoon guru Jerry Beck to participate and make this series something special. The price is a bit high for no frills DVDs with only 12 cartoons per disc too. That being said I highly recommend these discs and commend Olive Films for doing what no other previous owner of the Betty Boop elements had any interest in doing....giving us stellar quality Betty Boop cartoons...and in Blu-ray too!",1376870400,46,1683,4.926056338028169

5774441,4,B00D4C6780,"I bought the Blu Ray Of Volumes 1 Thru 4 so this is an overall review of the entire collection. Honestly, I don't know if this collection includes every single Betty Boop cartoon ever made but it's plenty enough for me. I am especially thrilled that the earlier (and somewhat cheekier) shorts from the early 1930s are here. It's also nice to have her family-friendly toons from the late 1930s included but the earlier shorts are more my speed.

Personally, I thought the toons looked amazing. The visuals are crisp and the sound is quite good. I think Olive Films did a good job with restoring these classic toons on Blu Ray.

Only two gripes. Firstly, I wish Olive Films was able to include a featurette or two in this collection. I had previously purchased a VHS collection of Betty Boop shorts from Republic Pictures and that included a decent retrospective about Betty Boop (her origin, search for her ""voice"", the controversial aspects of the early Betty shorts, Betty's influence on pop culture, etc.). It would've been nice to get some historians and ""official Bettyphiles"" to talk about her legacy and even have some commentary for her more notable shorts. These volumes have the shorts and nothing but the shorts.

I also wish the volumes were in chronological order. I guess Olive Films figured that some people might just buy one volume so each disc has shorts from the early 1930s to the late 1930s. Each disc has its own kind of retrospective showing Betty's range from her risque antics to her homemaker heyday. The shuffling of the toons sparks spontaneity and the toons are stand alone adventures so it's not like some major plot continuity is being disrupted. Still, my preference would've been for the toons to be shown based on release date.

Overall, this is a great treasure now preserved on Blu Ray to be enjoyed for many years to come. Like the Looney Tunes shorts, Betty Boop's cartoons are genuine classics that endure even now. This is a must have for Betty fans who have been waiting for a well-done release of Betty's toons on Blu Ray (and I can only hope the DVD versions are just as good). This is also a plus for film buffs, animation fans and nostalgia lovers. This was worth the wait. Thank you, Olive Films.",1418083200,6,2241,4.680203045685279
5774442,3,B00D4C6780,"This set does not have the original apertures. About 1/4th of the image has been cropped top and bottom to make these classics fit on 4:3 televisions screens. It looks as if they cropped more off the top than the bottom. And in Bamboo Isle, the opening shot of the Royal Samoans has been inexplicably widened.
In Snow White, on Betty Boop: The Essential Collection, Vol. 4, the executioner cries while sharpening his blade. His head drifts off the screen for most of it. We see him crying only when he lowers his head. From what I remember, from seeing these in a theater, his head is clearly visible through the whole blade sharpening sequence.
There are a few speckles in the image, too. But, this set is great otherwise. Certainly, this is not the definitive Betty Boop set, but it's the best around. Oh, and the sound is great. The mix is lively and rollicking fun.",1415318400,6,869,4.54140127388535
5774443,5,B00D4C6780,"Love It! Can't wait to get Volumes 2,3, 4. A must have for Betty Boop fans!",1406678400,,75,3.75
5774444,5,B00D4C6780,"On this DVD there are the cartoons CHESS NUTS, BETTY BOOP MD, BETTY BOOP'S BAMBOO ISLE, BETTY BOOP FOR PRESIDENT, BETTY'S PENTHOUSE, BETTY BOOP'S BIRTHDAY PARTY, BETTY BOOP'S MAY PARTY, BETTY BOOP'S HALLOWEEN PARTY, BETTY BOOP'S RISE TO FAME, BETTY BOOP'S TRIAL, BETTY BOOP'S LIFE GUARD, AND THE FOXY HUNTER

Here is some basic Boop history: The dog Bimbo (who appears in some Betty Boop Cartoons) was a semi-star long before Ms. Boop was created. However, over time Bimbo's career slowly died, and Ms. Boop's career (her first appearance was as a dog like character in ""Dizzy Dishes"") took off. Ms. Boop was a star for about a decade, and in the beginning of her career (early 30's) she was known to be a little risqu. However, over time the sensor's office won, by taking more and more of her risqu qualities away from her. By the end of Mrs. Boop's career she was dressed/ personified more as an innocent house wife/working girl (though she wasn't married). Betty had started her career as a sexy character, and she had replaced Bimbo (the dog) in the beginning, but towards the end of her own career Betty's dog (Pudgy) took over her films. Gradually Betty was seen less and less, as the cartoons began to evolve more around Pudgy.
Now, about this DVD. Personally, I have seen certain shorts (like CHESS NUTS) on other DVD/ VHS formats, and most of the time the images are grainy, sound quality poor, and scenes cut out/edited. However, from what I am use to seeing of the Betty Boop transfers, this is by far the best quality/ un-edited versions of her cartoon shorts. Yes, there are flaws throughout each episode (fuzzy, lines, ect.), but it's not pronounced enough to take away from the Betty Boop Cartoon stories. These are 80 year old shorts that ( have not been as cleaned up as some Fleischer Popeye cartoons), but have been restored very nicely indeed. At times you'll get great restoration on both film and sound (on this DVD). Other times you might just get better picture then sound, and visa-versa. What I really loved about this DVD is that there were cartoon shorts that I had not seen on any other Betty Boop DVDs. Also, I loved how almost all the shorts revolved around Betty, and not Pudgy!!!!! In the past I have bought, so called, ""Betty Boop"" DVDS, only to find that a good portion of those cartoons revolved around Pudgy (Betty as a side character)...On this DVD it's 99%  Betty Boop. Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
As for children watching These cartoons???? I, personally, would allow my children to watch this DVD. Yes there are times where her dress might flip up and you see her bloomers/ bra, but by todays views it looks like a bathing suit/short skirt???? I don't know, you need, as the parent, to watch/ gage whether these cartoons are right for your children OR not. Also, it depends on your child's personality! Some children could careless about old black and white cartoon shorts, especially when My Little Pony is on TV. However, there are other children who would enjoy these Betty Boop cartoons. Personally, I never cared for Mrs. Boop as a child. I thought her cartoon shorts were just silly, and some times confusing.  However, as a teenager, and now as an adult, I have grown an appreciation towards these old classic shorts, and now I love Mrs. Boop. Please keep in mind about your child's personality when purchasing this product. No, I don't think that moments of Betty's skirt lifting up, is to kinky (especially by todays cartoon standards). She NEVER wears a thong, or even lace panties, they're mostly white bloomers/ slip. Initially, these quick scenes might surprise an adult (due to this ridiculous current cultural notion that animation/ Hollywood was so innocent back in the 1920's/30's). I know that when I first saw Betty (years ago) I wasn't expecting to see her bloomers, and yes, it made my eyes widen for a second, then I was over it...no great shock. Also, there are occasional references to ""possible"" alcohol, and other adult activities (a bird might pick up a mug of frosty beer/what looks like a beer-not actually labeled as beer and drink it.).you decide. I've seen more offensive scenes in modern day kid's films then Betty Boop cartoons, but that does not mean that you'll feel the same way, and I am aware of that. Also, there are adult moments, which parents will get the meaning/reference of, but I doubt that a child would???????? You figure it out. Also, in the short BETTY BOOP FOR PRESIDENT the word ""ass"" is used. However, it is not used as a curse word, but instead as a reference to the donkeys (Democratic Party). Also, read the following...might help you in deciding if this DVD is right for your child, or not.

If you are an adult buying this DVD for yourself, and are not familiar with Ms. Boop please keep the followings in mind (1) There are the occasional kinky moments. However, it is NOTHING like what you see on modern shows like Family Guy, Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, etc. Don't buy this with the expectation of being shocked/ for shock value (un-less you have a thing for bloomers). (2) Yes, there are certain episodes where there is adult material suggested. For example in CHESS NUTS the king takes Betty into his bedroom, and the bed comes out (reference to the bed not wanting an inappropriate sexual act happening on it). However, if a child was watching this same scene chances are that he/she would not get the meaning/references. In my opinion modern day films, like the Shrek Movies suggest sexuality WAY more then the old Betty Boop Cartoons. After all, you won't see in a Betty Cartoon (unlike Shrek 2) a cat licking his privates, and then coming onto a women. I am not bashing Shrek, I am just making a point. (3) The average Betty Cartoon revolves around a basic story plot, lots of singing, and often filled with abstract scenes. Some of the scenes will not make sense to modern day viewers. The Fleischer company was well known for creating images/ scenes that were strange and abstract. The early Fleisher cartoons, by some, are considered to be the inspiration for modern day music videos. One example of an abstract scene (in Betty's cartoons) revolves around a baby who is singing, and his face gradually morphs into a hairy man/ wolf like face. (4) You should watch these shorts with more of an nostalgic flavor in mind (like, ""wow! This is what was cool 80 years ago.""), not necessarily seeing it through todays eyes. However, if you are an artist you may appreciate it more with your current perspective. Give it a chance, watch at least five shorts to help you in developing a flavor (if you don't have it developed already) for Ms. Boop and her classic cartoons. Chances are that after you watch this DVD you will end up singing one of her songs.
These are also very old cartoons with different standards/ views compared to todays standards/views. Some people might find some Betty Boop cartoons (a little) offensive?...even at times sexist? Please keep in mind that Betty Boop was seen as a sort of ""trail blazer"" of her era. She was a working girl (never married-not an acceptable choice for women at that time), she took care of her own life (didn't rely on a man to survive financially). In one short she even tried to become the first woman president. On the other hand she could at times be dependent on a male to save her, and or occasionally use her sexuality to get out of predicaments. The one episode BETTY ON TRIAL started out strong (concerning women's rights/lib.). At first she refused to cave into the advances of a handsome cop (she stood up to an authority figure). She ended up in court, and was against a sexist, all male, courtroom (it was even implied that she was not taken seriously because the judge took notes on her legs/figure). However, though it starts off strong (concerning women standing up against a sexist 1930's world), she quickly caves in, and takes off with the cop (at end). By today's standards, this can be viewed as an insult to women. However, in the 1930's it was seen as a type of revolutionary movement (being against a sexiest, male society). However, in the 1930's it was an absolute male run world, the Fleischer Company wanted to be revolutionary, but at the same time they did not want to completely anger the culture norms/way of thinking of the time (that is why Betty ended up with the cop). Just the idea of a woman standing up against a male dominated world (in the 1930's) was a break through in movies/culture...basically, what I am saying is, ""respect Betty and her cartoons for what they are/were"".
p.s. the original Betty cartoons were designed mostly for children, but also for adults, however, when watching these shorts don't expect a Family Guy (more modern) sort of adult cartoon. 95% of Betty's cartoons are silly/ meant for children, but it is the other 5% that can become/ get a little adult (but not a PG13 rating).
Basically my final thought is, ""at least watch Betty to see what all the interest/ cultural hype is about"".

5774445,5,B00D4C6780,This is the original Betty Boop and maybe a little too reiue for the younger one in your house. But adults will enjoy it and catch the double meanings and the laughs,1395360000,,165,4.1875
5774446,2,B00D4C6780,"The industry is still working in the analog era with little to no understanding with digital.

First off it is irrelevant for a Blu-ray HD 1k downscaled image as to what it was scanned in at, despite what the industry may think. You are still getting a 1k (1080) image NOT a 4k, thus anything 4k is lost on 1k downscaled copy.

Secondly 35mm is about 1k, so for 16mm film scanning at 4k is a waste of space and purely overkill.

Thirdly there is no technical advantage to ""downscaling"" as opposed to actually scanning in at native. In fact scanning in at 1k (1080) would avoid any downscaling artifacts based on a set software algorithm, thus native scanning is better.

With that said don't expect to be blown away by this unless you are a Blu-ray fanboy and don't fully understand any of the technology and just listen to what the industry puts out (i.e. where is 3D these days? Same place 4k will wind up.) Quality is OK but nothing I would rave about because it was scanned in at 4k, 8k or 16k all are irrelevant for a BD anyway.",1394236800,2,1033,4.33678756476684
5774447,4,B00D4C6780,"Hands down, the most indispensable DVD/Blu -ray collections released in 2013 are the two volumes of the Fleischer original Betty Boop cartoons from Olive films. Betty Boop, The Essential Collections, Vols 1 & 2 (2013) are long overdue. Although Volume 1 is not perfect (more on that later), it is the best Boop collection we have seen since the eight volume Definitive Collection distributed by Republic on VHS in 1996. (Earlier this year, Legend Films released The Uncensored Betty Boop, which is exactly what it says it is: pre-Hays Code Betty, but of fairly low-grade quality).

The Definitive Collection conceptually broke the Fleischer shorts into the Birth of Betty  (she debuted in 1930), pre-Code, Surrealism, and Musical Madness. However, the collection also featured the later, watered down, post-Code Betty, complete with her Promise Keeper-styled housedress and a boyfriend (to keep her monogamously domesticated). Since Republic strove to release a complete collection, this inclusion was necessary, but its certainly not Betty at her best. Indeed, it is the post-Code Betty which is indirectly responsible for the bland fridge magnets and license plates we have been saturated with by companies and persons who have probably never seen Betty in in her original incarnation.

The basic rule with Betty Boop is that the shorts are best up through 1934. In Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) Betty (making her first on-screen appearance in 49 years) tells Bob Hoskins that she was ruined by color. Actually, Betty Boop was spayed and destroyed by the Legion of Decency and by Will Hays. The proof of pudding is in shorts like The Foxy Hunter (1937) from Volume One, in which Betty is anything but foxy. Stuck in a servile, matronly role, she plays second banana to mans best friend. Her trademark garter is long gone; remnants of a past sex life. In its place is Betty, stuck in a Dan Cathy-approved dress and relegated to June Cleavers kitchen. (Most, if not all, the Betty shorts featuring Pudgy the dog are painful to watch, especially after seeing Betty in her prime. Fortunately, her prime makes up most of Volumes 1 & 2).

Flappers Clara Bow and Helen Kane were the primary models for Max Fleischer and animator Grim Natwick when creating Betty. Kane attempted to sue Paramount and Fleischer studios for wrongful appropriation. Her suit was unsuccessful, despite the fact that Betty was clearly modeled after Kanes distinct baby Bronx accent, look, persona, and songs such as I Wanna Be Loved By You and Boop Boop a Doop. Four different actresses had the dual job of voicing Betty and Olive Oyl from Fleischers Popeye the Sailor cartoons: Margie Hines (who was the first, hired because she sounded like Kane), Bonnie Poe (the only one of the four who  played a live action Betty, in a 1933 Hollywood on Parade short opposite Bela Lugosi as Dracula) Kate Wright (briefly and sporadically, a fill-in), and, most famously, Mae Questel (who voiced Betty the longest, from 1931 all the way to her 1988 Roger Rabbit cameo). Fleischer spotted Questel performing in a club act that mixed elements of both Bow and Kane.

It is surprising that Olive Films has not included any of Bettys jazz-scored shorts, but this concern may be premature, since the distributor has announced these are the first of  four volumes (the next two are slated for a 2014 release). Reportedly, Olive does not plan to release any of the public domain Betty cartoonswhich is odd since the company has previously released several volumes of public domain works, to well-deserved accolades.

Although the shorts have been beautifully remastered, they have not been restored, which means, yes, they still look like film stock. Considering how some of the Disney classics (most notably Pinocchio) have been digitally restored to the point of losing their visual film edge, this is probably a good thing. There are no supplemental extras, just the cartoons.

Volume One opens with Betty, already fully evolved, in Chess Nuts (1932). Betty, along with other Fleischer Inkwell Imp favorites, Bimbo and Koko the Clown, all literally become chess pieces to liven up a boring game played by two old geezers. Mixing a bit of live action with animation, Betty almost becomes victim to a fetishistic old King Cole. During the ensuing chaos, Betty shows a tad too much tush, but a table obligingly closes the blinds on her draft. Koko was taken out of temporary retirement to join Betty and he, like many of the early Fleischer characters, deserves a retrospective release all his own. (1928s mind boggling Earth Control, starring Koko, is an example of Fleischers bizarre, unorthodox style).

Betty Boop M.D. (1932) finds Betty and Koko hawking medicine oil. Koko enlists Bettys sex appeal to loosen the change of a financially conservative crowd. The results of Bettys Jippo wreck havoc, of course, with no less than a cameo of Frederic March as Edward Hyde.

Betty Boops Bamboo Isle (1932) features Betty and Bimbo setting sail for an exotic island. Bimbo was one of the stars of Fleischers Talkartoons and would occasionally appear, as he does here, as Bettys canine boyfriend. Due to the hints of bestiality, Bimbo would go the way of the dinosaur with the advent of the Production code. Racial stereotypes abound here, as does a semi-topless Betty engaged in a hula dance.

Betty Boop for President (1932) has Betty morphing (albeit briefly) into Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Durante as she runs for prez against Mr. Nobody. Clever lyrics (which I stole for the Hillary Clinton caricature in W The Movie) secure her win (yes, its a cartoon). Its an idealized portrayal of America, in which neither left nor right are extremist loons and misogyny is a thing of the past. Under Bettys watch, the thugs of the world get transformed by receiving a large dose of femininity (obviously, Phil Robertsons vision of hell), everybody gets ice cream, and Prohibition is forever repealed delightfully dating the short).

Predating Jimmy Stewarts voyeuristic Hitchcock protagonist, Bimbo and Koko get an eyeful of Betty bathing (shades of the biblical King David) in Betty Boops Penthouse (1933). Our inkwell imps rush to save her from a would-be rapist modeled on Boris Karloffs Frankensteins monster. Al Jolsons Mammy characterization makes a cringe-inducing cameo.

We are invited to a triptych of 1933 Boop-styled parties with Bettys Birthday Party, Bettys May Party, and Bettys Halloween Party. Predictably, the best is saved for the All Hallows Eve get together, with King Kong himself crashing the proceedings in his attempt to ravage our heroine.

Max and Dave Fleischer appear in Bettys Rise to Fame (1934). She pays homage to Fanny Brice, pulls a Victor/Victoria for Maurice Chevalier, and arouses Daves pen. Cab Callow voices the Old Man On The Mountain and joins Betty in a little Hi De Ho.

Betty Boops Trial (1934) features a male cast of raging libidos as Betty is tried for resisting an officer.

The androgynous Freddy is Betty Boops Life Guard (1934). He cant save Betty from her poor swimming skills, which transform her into a mermaid.

Volume One ends depressingly, with Bettys boop-oop-a-doop stolen in the aforementioned Foxy Hunter.

High definition transfers from the best possible source material. No other release of these cartoons has looked this good before.

The design work of the packaging is nicely done. The Blu Ray (and I assume the DVD too) comes in a nicely designed slipcase that actually does contain a little bit of information about the cartoons including the years that each one on the set was released. Even the on disc printing is nicely designed and the cover art looks much better in real life than it does listed on Amazon.

The cartoons are in chronological order

Cartoons are uncensored.

WHATS NOT GOOD

While these are scanned in from the best possible source material. There has been no attempt at restoration. No cleaning up of the film scratches, no restoration of the original opening and closing titles (The original film titles where changed when they where sold to TV). They could have at least restored the original opening and closing film titles (they do exist).

No extras. No commentary tracks from animation historians. No extra bonus features. There are only 12 cartoons in this set and quite frankly a little something extra would have been nice and made this set a better value for the money that they are charging.

THE VERDICT

If you are an animation fan or Betty Boop fan: GET IT.

I have to admit, I almost didn't get this because it was such a bare bones release with only 12 cartoons for 25 dollars.

The price point for this package was ""almost"" unacceptable, and I have heard that some animation fans are not buying it for that reason.

But we need more vintage animation restoration releases and not buying this will only send a message that there is not enough market to justify doing it (as opposed to sending a message that these releases need to be done properly....which they do).",1378252800,39,1818,4.700315457413249
5774455,5,B00D4C6780,"While these classic gems may not be ""restored"", the original 35mm Nitrate Fine Grain masters have been used to master this Hi-Def release.
The image is sharp, the contrast is good.  The sound is crisp, clear and free of most noise.
There is occasional picture movement that could have been fixed with an image stabilization program, but this would be restoration work, which was not done.
White negative dust does appear, mostly at the beginning & end of the cartoons, but it is not distracting.

One advantage of a lack of 'restoration' is NO DVNR like the old Laserdiscs & VHS tapes.

It has been demonstrated at the Cartoon Research webpage that in the early days of sound Max Fleischer did not use the standard 1:37-1 square picture ratio.  His cartoons were made in a slightly narrower frame ratio (called Movietone Ratio).  These cartoons have been scanned to capture the original full frame, but slightly stretched to fill the 1:37-1 square video image.  For the most part this stretching will be unnoticeable, but if you compare the frames to old VHS tapes you will see more picture at the top & bottom on this new HD Blu-ray transfer.

Unfortunately the original Television distributor spliced their replacement UM&M-TV logo right into the Nitrate Fine Grain masters!  So the original Paramount Logos are lost.  This poor judgement on UM&M's part keeps their name on the films forever even though they were only in business for a few years.  However, many of these have their original Paramount title cards intact.

AS FOR THE CARTOONS: They are classics.  Many of these are ""Per-Code"" and have risque humor, you will see Betty's garter & underwear here.  Only the last two cartoons are ""Post-code"" and had to be kept clean for the Hays Office.
While Max Fleischer lacked the big budgets of Walt Disney, he made up for this in clever surreal story lines.  You can tell these gray cartoons are a product of New York City and not glitzy Hollywood.
CAB CALLOWAY makes a brief appearance in a clip for the ""Old Man Of the Mountain"" used in the ""cheater"" cartoon ""Betty Boop's Rise To Fame""
While ""BETTY BOOP'S LIFEGUARD"" was technically released 13 days after the Hays Office took force, it still has the feel & flavor of the pre-code Betty Boops, complete with garter-belt & boobs that look like they want to pop out. The Fleischers may have gotten away with this because Betty was wearing a swimming suit.
However ""THE FOXY HUNTER"" hardly has Betty in it at all, it is a PUDGY & JUNIOR cartoon that hardly deserves to be in this set. The only reason to watch it is to realize how bad the Betty Boop series got after the Hays Office cleaned it up.  It seems as if the Fleischers wanted to destroy the series by taking all humor out of it and turn the series into cartoons with morals to teach,  Hardly how Betty got her start.

Once you finish watching this disc you will be yearning for more!  Be patient, volume 2 is on the way (along with future volumes if sales warrant it).  I just wish a second disc was included with the non-Betty Boop Fleischer Cartoons, that would be the only way we would get to see those gems.  And Jerry Beck's input is missed here, he would have replaced those Paramount logos like he did with Popeye and given us some good background on these gems.

THE MENU is brief but it does give you the option to ""PLAY ALL"" or select specific ""SHORTS"", at least on the Blu-ray version a pop-up menu bar gives you the shorts to select from.

Accidentally Preserved, Vol. 1
Animation Cartoon History: Tramp, Tramp, Tramp DVD (1924) Directed by Max Fleischer. Starring Koko the Clown.",1377734400,4,5772,6.656458055925433
5774456,4,B00D4C6780,"This set is the best set that featured the shorts of the Boop girl. No restoration, but quality still looks great in Full HD. Every cartoon still bears the U.M.&M. logos in the beginning, and end, but none of the scenes were cut. Six of the cartoons still bear the Paramount copyright, but still has the replaced logos in the beginning. They could've done better with that, since it was licensed from Paramount. But the quality still looks very superior than any set you'll find out there!! Very impressed! They used 4k scans of original elements, and it sure looks like they did! No extras, or captions, by the way. Olive Films have done it again. I recommend this set.",1377216000,8,670,4.591666666666667
5774457,5,B00D4C6780,"This is THE animation release of the year for us fans of classic cartoons.  I was beginning to think we'd never see official, restored releases of these true treasures of animation.  I love cartoons from most every studio and era, from Looney Tunes up through the ""limited"" animation styles of the 60's.  But no one made 'em like the Fleischers in their pioneering early days.  Along with the studio's early Popeye shorts, the Betty Boop's are simply some of the most creative, zany, funny, and (let's face it) weird short films ever committed to celluloid.

A few others have complained about Olive Film's plans to release the cartoons in four single-disc sets, with a dozen cartoons per set.  I assume the studio is doing this to test the waters, and be sure there is a market for the DVD's before they make them all.  But even if, on a more cynical note, it's just to make more money. . .who cares?  The target audience for these films WILL buy them all, and I for one am grateful to Olive and Paramount for investing in this long-neglected property.

As for the A/V quality, both are almost uniformly excellent.  Anyone who's suffered through bootleg tapes, discs, or scratchy Youtube videos of these cartoons will be delighted at the clear and vibrant images.  I did notice a few of the title cards seemed a bit grainy, but the main body of each short is probably the best they will ever look.  If you love old cartoons, or Betty Boop in particular, there's no question that you need this set in your collection.",1377043200,4,1517,4.598513011152416
