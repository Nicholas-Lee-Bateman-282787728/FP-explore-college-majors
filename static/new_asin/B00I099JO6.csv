6245305,4,B00I099JO6,"I was very excited when I heard about this collection. Never before had all of the Gamera films been collected in a single collection. The only concerns I had was that this was going to be released by a budget DVD company. Well my expectations for an awesome set were met, but I do have a couple of concerns to point out.

First I would like to point out that the picture quality is really good on this set. I watched the original B&W Gamera last night and the picture looked better than I expected for a movie of a certain age. Grain and film lines were non-existent. The movie was even in glorious widescreen!! I don't really enjoy the 4:3 ratio that these budget companies use most of the time for classic movies.

Second I would like to point out the language options on this set....which is none. The films are spoken Japanese with English subtitles only. This provides an authentic viewing experience, but I sometimes enjoy listening to the poor dub work on English audio tracks. Not a very big deal for fans of this genre.

Third I would like to mention the packaging, which may disappoint some. When I unboxed this set what surprised me first was the slipcover. I have never seen a slipcover come with a budget set like this. Also the cover art is very nice for this release. The next thing I noticed when I opened the box is the stacked discs. Many people do not like this, and I personally prefer swinging hub style cases. I may have to replace the case so that I can protect these discs better.

In conclusion, this set is awesome for any new or old Gamera fans alike. The movies are entertaining and the picture quality is good. The package is overall very nice, but could provide better protection for the discs. I would definitely not pass on this set. If you like old Kaiju or Japanese monster movies pick up this set.",1398729600,61,1833,4.43026706231454

6245334,4,B00I099JO6,What I mean is there's no English dub movies and I prefer that but I don't mind reading English subs because I watch a lot of akira Kurosawa movies. The one thing is really bad about this set and you'll see this in almost every review is the discs on stacked on top of each other. Why not just a four disc flap or something. But it's a budget set so I guess it's what you expect. All in all not bad but needs improvement,1486944000,,420,3.9529411764705884

My personal favorite is ""Duel of the Giant Monsters: Gamera vs. Barugon"". It has a pretty dark storyline. ""Return of the Giant Monsters: Gamera vs. Gayos"" is pretty good as well. The revamped trilogy from the 90s is pretty good with the first, ""Gamera, Guardian of the Universe"", being the best, IMO.

6245361,2,B00I099JO6,"My kid is a fanatic for Godzilla and other Japanese monsters so we were psyched to find this Gamera set at such low price. He's been intrigued by Gamera for months.

However you get what you pay for. the movies have English subtitles and not dubbed. For a little kid who isn't that fast of a reader, this is a total buzzkill. He had trouble following along, and the wording visually blocks stuff as subtitles are won't to do.

Dubbed versions of at least some of these movies do indeed exist, we've borrowed some from the library or seen clips on YouTube.

If you don't mind subtitles, then this is a great deal.

On a side note regarding packaging, the DVDs are stacked directly one on top of the other in what looks like a regular DVD case - just deeper groove than the standard solo case so case not ideal for long term storage.",1473033600,,831,4.341935483870968

6245365,5,B00I099JO6,"I had seen some of these movies, dubbed in English as a kid.  At the time, I preferred Godzilla films waaaay more than the Gamera films. I thought the Gamera films were way too corny and cheesy. After all, I thought, Kaijus taking over the world was too serious to make light of. As an adult, though, I really do appreciate the cornicheese of it all. And it's so much better in the original Japanese. It makes the movies just much more authentic.

This item has 4 discs, and contains 11 movies. I don't know if you'd want to binge watch these films, though, unless you want the Gamera song playing inside your head non-stop later on.  Kidding aside, nostalgically, my favorite in this set was Gamera vs Viras, better known to me as Destroy All Planets.  It was the most shown of the Gamera films on local tv when I was growing up, but before viewing it from this set, I had never seen it in the original Japanese.  For me, this alone was worth the purchase, and 10 more films, including the original - hard to beat this set for Gamera films.",1471910400,2,1041,4.345360824742268

I don't see how blu ray can do a whole lot for such older made movies but Id be happy to hear from those whove seen and feel im wrong.

6245389,5,B00I099JO6,"Godzilla may be ""king of the monsters"" but let's face it, Gamera is a contender for the crown! If you love giant Japanese monsters (Kaij) then Gamera movies are among the best, and the worst. He's a giant turtle with tusks that can fly and breath fire for heaven's sake...what do you expect  from a movie like that? Not great acting, not great special effects, but a whole lot of fun. The original Godzilla movie was actually a very serious movie that was well acted and dramatic. Less about the monster and more about plot. Not so with Gamera! These movies are really about the monster.

6245440,5,B00I099JO6,"Like all Japanese monster movies, there is a fine line between having a campy cheapness and being just plain stupid, and this series crosses the line often, especially when they show footage from previous movies, as they do in Super Monster.  But thats the way it is with the genre, and you take the good with the bad.

The Gamera monster seems to have a distinct and recognizable personality, more so than almost any other monster except Godzilla.  One of his characteristics is that he likes children, which is fine, except that it means that the movies often include annoying child characters.  But the story lines are creative and the alien enemies are well conceived.

You see a lot of stuff in the series that may have been borrowed later on by Hollywood.  For example, in Zigra, the spacewoman, played by Eiko Yanami, goes to earth on a mission to kill someone, and when she arrives, she needs earthling clothing, so she takes some from someone she encounters on arrival  just like in the Terminator.  The best part is; the first person she encounters is a girl on the beach in a bikini, and so Yanami dons the bikini and walks around Tokyo.

All 11 are good enough transfers, and the Japanese language format is a plus for people who know some Japanese and want to practice listening to it.",1431216000,2,1298,4.608695652173913

Before you buy, though, just understand that all the films are in Japanese audio with English subtitles.  There are no other options.  Also, there are no extra features.

That is because they tried to fit too many movies on a single disc rather than spread them over a couple more.  One color title suffers from it most but in general, I am glad to get all 11 movies from Showa and Heisei (it does not have the last movie of the series from 2006 ""Gamera the Brave"" from another studio) in hand for my collection.  Why I gave it 4 stars is because it does not include an English audio track, only subtitles.

Seriously, if you're considering this set, get it before the price goes up (ie goes out of print or renewed interest in Gamera, whichever comes first). For me, the main attraction is the 90s trilogy, which alone is worth the price of this set. These films are a treat, even enjoyable for a casual viewer or movie buff.

I keep looking away from the screen for a moment and missing something.

Eleven of the twelve Gamera movies are included on four discs. They all go on one--whatever it's called. The inside of the case is much cheaper than most multi-discs DVDs I own. There are no special features on any of the discs.

All of those are very minor complaints. Much more serious is this one: They've left out Gamera the Brave! Why?

6245512,5,B00I099JO6,"A few weeks prior to its April 29th street date, I was browsing around here on Amazon and learned that the release of this new Gamera box set was right around the proverbial corner. I was excited by this news and pleased to see that Mill Creek was responsible for this set. Those folks have given hardcore Japanese giant robot show fans like myself excellent collections of old tokusatsu (special effects) programs like Super Robot Red Baron, Iron King and, best of all, Ultraman.

Having first seen them as rentals, for many years I had wanted to have in my library the post-Showa Era Gamera films that were made between 1995 and 1999. Prior to their inclusion in this GAMERA LEGACY COLLECTION, those films had been previously released in a super affordable GAMERA TRILOGY blu-ray box set, also produced by Mill Creek. I, however, don't own a blu-ray player, and I wasn't ready to scoot out to get one just so that I could finally have the aforementioned films.

As it often does, though, the heavenly virtue that is patience paid off and I now have all three of the 1990s Gamera films in DVD format. But I also have a whole lot more, and all for a really great price. In addition to those films, Mill Creek's GAMERA LEGACY COLLECTION gives me all eight of the Showa era Gamera films made between 1965 and 1980. As a kid growing up in Chicago in the 1970s, I had only seen four of those.

When they were released roughly a decade ago, I bought the Alpha Video releases of GAMERA THE INVINCIBLE, ATTACK OF THE MONSTERS, DESTROY ALL PLANETS and WAR OF THE MONSTERS, which completed my small collection of the four versions I once saw on TV as a kid. And, since I already owned those, I was very pleased to learn that Mill Creek was releasing all of the Gamera films in the original Japanese with subtitles -- since the pangs of youthful nostalgia were previously satiated by the Alpha Video releases.

Also, I think I'm becoming something of a purist when it comes to foreign films. This first only applied to American remakes of foreign titles, but it lends itself now to old movies that I first saw as dubs. Thus, the DVD issues that I find myself liking most are those that, like some of the recent Godzilla issues, feature two discs that provide the original Japanese and also English dub of a film. This way, whether I'm feeling snooty or nostalgic, I have a version that will feed either need.

I'm also quite aware, too, that the visual masters for the American English dubs aren't always available for licensing. Taking into consideration that maybe not all of the eleven films included in this collection have even been dubbed into English, I applaud Mill Creek for just releasing them in their unadulterated form. I've always wanted to see all of the Gamera films and now I have them in their pure form for a price that I would have happily paid just for three of them.

Mill Creek has done it again, daikaiju fans, by releasing yet another great collection that will please the hardcore fans of Gamera who also happen to be...literate. The picture quality on the earlier gems in this collection is the very best I've ever seen (considering now what is very noticeably lost in the DVD transfers of the old Americanized versions. It's almost like seeing these movies for the first time). The sound quality and the subtitles are also top-notch, contrary to any reviews here that may whine otherwise.

Another nice job, Mill Creek. Keep up the good work!",1402790400,,3460,4.59805510534846

Most of the movies are subtitled pretty well, but I found with ""Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris"" the translation was not done very well. Throughout the film there are (what appear to be) important chunks of dialogue that are not translated. Usually it is during a conversation between characters where one character's response is not given a subtitle and the audience is left to guess what was said. Sometimes this seems to contain some vital exposition that would be helpful to have known. Having not watched all the films in this collection yet I cannot say if this problem exists in other films.

6245517,3,B00I099JO6,"Mill Creek Entertainment has come a long way from releasing public domain 50 movie packs advertised on late night television. They've acquired a massive collection of all types of interesting media, as one look on their website will show. Lately they've been jumping on the giant monster bandwagon, and just at the right time too with 2014's Godzilla becoming a blockbuster at the theater. Everyone's 2nd favorite big monster from Japan gets some love here in this 4 disc collection. 11 of the 12 Gamera movies are included. The only one missing from this set is Gamera The Brave from 2006.

Gamera: The Giant Monster (1965)
The first entry of this Sci-Fi epic takes place midst the peak of the Cold War, as conflict between the East and West transforms into a nuclear disaster! This atomic explosion releases more than massive radiation, it awakens an ancient and long-forgotten legend of  Gamera! B&W 2.35:1

Gamera vs. Barugon (1966)
Once the fear of Tokyo, Gamera returns to Earth to save it from the malevolent monster Barugon who is able to freeze anything its path. This unholy battle between fire and ice challenges the survival of mankind while bringing them an incredible slam-bang, knock-down monster slug-fest! 2.35:1

Gamera vs. Gyaos (1967)
The third entry of this classic monster series continues when a volcanic eruption awakens Gyaos, a gigantic vampire-like bat who has a ravenous hunger for blood. Gyaos is Gameras most popular foe, returning in four more films (not counting the stock footage in SUPER MONSTER). Can the fire-spitting terrapin Garmera defeat this nocturnal beast? 2.35:1

Gamera vs. Viras (1968)
The reign of terror continues when aliens take two boy scouts hostage to blackmail Gamera into aiding their invasion of Earth. When that plan fails the giant alien leader Viras battles the flying turtle in a duel to the death. 2.35:1

Gamera vs. Guiron (1969)
Gamera, the giant flying turtle, spins into action when two young boys board a spaceship and are hijacked to a strange planet on the other side of the sun. While the boys evade the clutches of two brain-hungry alien beauties, Gamera must deal with a knife-nosed monster named Guiron. 2.35:1

Gamera vs. Jiger (1970)
The fire-breathing action continues as Gamera battles one of his greatest foes, Jiger, a horned monster reminiscent of the Triceratops. Drawn to the World Expo in Osaka by an ancient statue, the evil reptile injects Gamera with its parasitic offspring to eliminate the super turtle. 2.35:1

Gamera vs. Zigra (1971)
The shark-like alien Zigra attacks Earth to enslave the human race as food. Aided by spacewoman X-1, Zigras wicked plan goes swimmingly until the invaders are challenged by Gamera and confounded by two trouble-making kids. 2.35:1

Gamera: Super Monster (1980)
The final entry of the Showa Gamera series plays as a highlight reel reviving all of the previous evil monsters. When the alien Zanon tries to conquer Earth with an army of monsters, three superwomen enlist the help of Gamera to foil the invaders plans. 1.85:1

Gamera: Guardian of the Universe (1995)
Gamera is back with a vengeance as he takes on both a misguided military and a trio of hideous, man-eating flying monsters. 1.85:1

Gamera 2: Attack of Legion (1996)
A freak meteor shower brings with it electrical problems, overgrown plant life and a whole slew of rather irritable critters that drop in to threaten the human race. Its up to Gamera to destroy the bugged-out invaders. 1.85:1

Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris (1999)
The Gyaos have returned along with a new, tentacled super-monster named Iris. Dr. Nagamine and Asagi Kusanagi are reunited to help Gamera in his relentless quest to stop his enemies from overrunning the Earth. 1.85:1

There are a few drawbacks to picking up this set. I found that every film in the set had a bit of pixelation. Not enough to ruin the movies, but I did notice it. I have a 42"" widescreen T.V. And while that's not anything spectacular, it gives you an idea of what I was watching the movies on, and saw the pixilation. The major drawback for me was the subtitles only option. Yes, I'm giving this a high rating because the movies themselves are cheesy fun, but I'm also making sure to point out some things you might want to know before picking this set up, because there are other options available. I saw a lot of these movies when I was a kid, and they were all dubbed into English. They were fun, campy, and a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. I find that now, as an adult, I want to have the same option to watch these in dubbed English if I choose to, and that option is not there. Parents picking this up in the five dollar bin for your kids to enjoy, beware of this, because I don't know many kids that enjoy reading subtitles. If you can handle those two problems, then this is the set for you, and priced right. If these are problems you want to avoid, some of these films are in the public domain, and dubbed into English under alternate titles, and also Shout Factory released most of these films a few years ago as well. Be sure to check out all of your options before you purchase.",1400630400,4,5126,4.772009029345372
6245518,5,B00I099JO6,i first came across gamera films when i was very young i already own most of the series american dubbed anyway so i was interested to see the original versions in thier native language. very impressed would recomend this to anyone who is a fan of classic kiaju films.,1400457600,,267,4.469387755102041
6245519,3,B00I099JO6,You would think with all the room on disks today or even the blu-ray copy of these movies they would have put the English version somewhere.  I love movies in original form cause I don't mind reading subtitles. My kids on the other hand let me know their opinion.  If you think your kids will enjoy these movies not understanding Japanese then go for it.  Otherwise be prepared for the constant complaining that they don't understand anything.,1400025600,2,443,4.7272727272727275
6245520,5,B00I099JO6,"While I own most of the older classic gamera movies I bought this one because it had a few that I did not plus the mid-late 90's trilogy. Having wanted to see the mid-late 90's trilogy for quite some time but putting it off and ending up being disapointed with other stuff I was not putting off instead. I must say I am kicking myself in the but for not getting these gems of Kaiju movies sooner. I own over 30 Kaiju movies and I must say I enjoyed Gamera Guardian of the Galexy and Gamera 2 Attack of Legion more than any in my collection, Including any Godzilla movies I have seen to date! Bold statement I know, but these movies rocked my socks! I feel it to be true. Two concern some buyers might have with this product is that there is not a scene selections option in the main menu and it is not an english dub. The subtitles are in english but all 11 movies are in Japanese. these did not bother me however and I feel that the awsomeness of the 90's trilogy and the number of movies one gets for the amount of money is so very worth it. Best $12 i have spent in my life.

Also as a long time Godzilla and all around Kaiju fan I might add that Gamera in attack of legion and revenge of Iris is so powerfull he puts any other Kaiju I have seen to shame! Though I love Godzilla, it is my opinion that the Gamera in these two movies would decimate any godzilla to date. If you buy this and have not seen the 90's trilogy get ready for one bad A** Kaiju!",1399852800,8,1456,4.038062283737024
6245521,3,B00I099JO6,"I'm upset.  Its all in Japanese with subtitles.  However, it's my fault for not reading the description more carefully.  Wish they would have made it more clear.",1399593600,,161,4.888888888888889
6245522,5,B00I099JO6,"this compilation iz magnificent...the only knock i have against it, they could've left  the stinkbomb known as gamera: super monster outta the mix, besides dat mistake...the rest will suffice!!!! love u' guys until da' next episode sayonara!!!",1399507200,,243,5.5675675675675675
6245523,4,B00I099JO6,I loved all 11 of these films and im glad that they are in widescreen and in their original language. Asian movies with a english language just sounds stupid and ruins the film.,1399420800,4,177,4.393939393939394
6245524,5,B00I099JO6,"These are Gamera monster movies made prior to the year 2000 so don't expect Avatar.
The movies are about a turtle that breathes fire and flies.
Most of them were not intended to be serious dramatic movies; they entertain kids and some adults.
They were made in Japan so the audio is Japanese and there are English subtitles.
There are no other audio or subtitle options.
There are no special features.
There are no chapter scene selections in the menu other than the individual movies. You can advance between chapters within the movies.

I am tired of reading reviews on Amazon from people that failed to read the available product details.  The details provided for this set are very clear and accurate; in particular it is clear that the audio is in Japanese and there are English subtitles.  Maybe too many people are using apps instead of going to the full Amazon website if they have questions - the product details on the website are sometimes better.

The product should be reviewed on what it promises and delivers.  This set has dropped in price to less than ten dollars in August 2014 and it is a great value for the money.  I purchased this set to view these movies on a regular basis in their original audio.  I have collected other versions and I appreciate them as a collector; for casual viewing this set is great.  I scanned through a few of the discs and the video is pretty good considering the age of the available materials. My overall opinion is that you don't have to be a huge kaiju fan to enjoy these, but it does help to be a fan of international cinema and Asian movies in particular.

One note: I will be also be getting the two Blu-Ray editions of the first 8 movies on this set.  I like Blu-Ray but I liked the price of this set.  There were reports that the first movie in the Volume 1 Blu-Ray set has lines in the image, but I have also been told that the lines may be part of the original set backgrounds that are visible in the Blu-Ray detail.  The DVDs look fine to me anyway.  I do have the Gamera trilogy Blu-Ray of the newer movies which have extras including a really fun English audio track on one film.

One more note: There is one more Gamera movie not included in this set - Gamera The Brave. Some people really like it, and some don't.  I haven't seen it.

Happy viewing to everyone that enjoys classic fun monster movies!",1399075200,47,2366,4.417050691244239
6245525,3,B00I099JO6,"when people buy these movies they should have the option of watching in english,when i was a kid i watched these movies and they were in english the subtitles go by so quick! and sellers of these movies should say if its in english or not! i ordered another gamera i pray its in english damn it!",1398988800,,295,4.192982456140351
6245526,2,B00I099JO6,"The Godzilla and Gamera films have become a much loved guilty pleasure in my household, and my five-year-old son and I watch them on a regular basis. Many reviews do not mention audio options, and I was grateful to read a review of this set that noted the only language option, in terms of audio being Japanese. I'm all for art being true to its original form, but I am a visually impaired/legally blind individual, and am unable to read subtitles.
When I read the reviews for the Shout Factory releases of Gamera everyone praised the quality of the picture, but did not reference the audio selections available. I was fortunate to stumble across a YouTube video that specifically stated that they were only in Japanese. I was excited to see this box set, despite it being from a less reputable company, however my excitement was quickly diminished after reading the review.
I fortunately own a Gamera collection of six movies on two discs that I'm able to comfortably enjoy watching with my son, however I have yet to find an affordable collection of the 1990s Gamera movies on DVD.
If you don't mind reading subtitles, I'm sure this set is a worthwhile investment, however do read the other reviews before buying.
In addition to being legally blind, I'm also physically challenged, and when I read that the discs are stacked, rather than placed in individual slots, or on a flip book style like the Godzilla collection, this was another downfall of this set in my opinion...",1398902400,,1476,4.747081712062257
