8085763,1,B000BF0CP2,"I saw the original video on cable tv, and loved it.  Unfortunately, this dvd seems to be one of those that are produced by some weird process, maybe in small batches, as needed?  I struck out, and both copies I ordered would not play--the first generated a distorted frozen frame/menu, but would not play on any of the 3 standard dvd players I tried.  I returned it to Amazon, and they ordered a replacement, which would not generate any kind of image.  Amazon was great about standing behind their product, but until they sort out the manufacturing problem(s), I'd recommend you look for an OLD copy somewhere to view.  The one star is because there is a manufacturing problem on these dvd's as of 2017-2018, not because the content of this program is bad.",1523577600,,757,4.619402985074627

8085769,5,B000BF0CP2,I missed this on the A&E Network and am so happy I have this in my DVD collection now.  It's magnificent and all the other words that go with it.  Shows off the jewelers' craftmanship at the finest and definitely a lost art by any standards. Each item featured was better than the one before. I don't think I could find my favourite Faberge egg. This is a DVD I will enjoy viewing again and sharing with friends and family.,1367280000,3,423,4.275
8085770,5,B000BF0CP2,"What I like about this DVD is that you learn about the tradition and history of the Faberge eggs and how they were gifts to members of the Imperial family to each other.  The only problem that I have with this DVD is that they don't show you all the Faberge eggs that were made and describe them in detail.  At the end of the DVD, they mentioned that Malcolm Forbes had purchsed some of the eggs at an auction, but they don't tell you which ones they are.  The DVD needs to go into further depth about the Faberge eggs that are still around.  They should also update the DVD to include a list as to where the eggs are now.  In fact, the Queen of England owns one of the Faberge eggs, and that fact isn't mentioned on the DVD.",1271116800,4,725,4.077464788732394
