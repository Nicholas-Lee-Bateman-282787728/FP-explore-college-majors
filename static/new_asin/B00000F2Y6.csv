Aspect ration is not correct, colors are washed out, and the entire video appears to be out of focus.  Too bad really, as I couldn't finish watching this due to the terrible image.  So I can't say anything good or bad about the flick itself.  But I figure it should be pretty good, as I like all the actors involved, so I gave it an extra star. Honestly, if you have the VHS tape, and a VCR that still works, don't bother with this DVD.",1413504000,,513,4.151515151515151

1206477,3,B00000F2Y6,"I hate to disagree with the majority of positive reviews posted here, but Sam Peckinpah reached rock bottom with this 1978 action-road movie which cashed in on the then popular craze for trucking and CB radio. Disillusioned with the box office failures of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974), The Killer Elite (1975) and Cross of Iron (1977), the great director was desperate to score a financial success that would resurrect his Hollywood career. As irony would have it, Convoy did go on to be the biggest earner of his career, but resurrection wasn't to be. This was due mainly to his alcoholism, cocaine addiction and consequent erratic on-set behavior. Apparently he spent long stretches of the shoot fashed n fagged laid up in his trailer while his friend James Coburn came in and directed (un-credited) much of the footage. After Convoy wrapped, Peckinpah disappeared from view, only coming back to direct the instantly forgettable The Osterman Weekend in 1983. By the next year he was dead.

The films B. W. L. Norton script was initially a mangled mess based as it was on a song and a dis-satisfied Peckinpah tried to get his large cast to pitch in a little improvisation to no great effect. Finally the story was whittled down to its basics which consists of a contest between super-cool trucker Rubber Duck (Kris Kristofferson coasting enjoyably) and nasty Sherrif Lyle Cottonmouth Wallace (Ernest Borgnine over-acting and stealing the picture) who is intent on extorting money from him. Other truckers come to the rescue (most memorably Burt Young as Pig Pen) and before we know it we have a huge convoy of trucks demonstrating against the tyranny of the powers that be. Ali MacGraw joins the party right at the beginning as Melissa, a photographer who has no purpose in the film other than make Rubber Duck look cool. The film is a succession of road chases, slow-motion crashes, fist-fights and a non-stop CB radio commentary barrage which may or may not amuse according to taste. The movie meanders meaninglessly for the first hour, but then picks up a bit of plot when one of their number (a black trucker named Spider Mike played by Franklyn Ajaye) gets arrested and is used as bait to lure Rubber Duck into a final confrontation with Wallace. A whole town is demolished and there is a cheeky pay-off.

The film is very much a light tongue-in-cheek project reminiscent of The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970) and Junior Bonner (1972). It is nowhere near as good as those and it would be a mistake to get all critical and analytic over it. Suffice it to say there is much parody of The Wild Bunch (1969) with the story of a group coming to the aid of a member in need, the bridge explosion, the brief rendition of Peckinpah standard Meet Me at the River, a character named in the credits as Deke Thornton, a truck-full of Christian revivalists and the mythologizing of Mexico as that promised land of romantic escape and macho life-enhancement. There is no sex or violence for a change, but feminists will blanch at the stereotyping of McGraw and Rubber Ducks movement from one female piece of flesh to the next with the director applauding his macho sex appeal. Also the substitution of phallic trucks for horses will appear faintly ridiculous to some. Best perhaps to just relax, let the film wash over you and treat it as eye-candy with the odd good joke spliced in.

Aside from Borgnines hilarious hamming, by far the best thing about Convoy is the excellent luminous photography (take a bow Harry Stradling, Jr) which captures the great American West magnificently. The films opening images are especially arresting. I know this is a cult-classic of sorts and those in the loop will need no further prompting to buy it. Also those into the trucking lifestyle will no doubt enjoy, but for Peckinpah devotees this is undoubtedly rather a sad footnote to an extraordinary career. Still, at least failures such as Pat Garret and Billy the Kid, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and Cross of Iron have been re-evaluated as masterpieces. Just goes to prove commercial success certainly does not equal great film-making and that the latter will usually win out in the end. Its a shame the director couldn't control his private demons well enough to stay alive and savor the transformation of his professional reputation.

On the technical side there is nothing wrong with the DVD, the visuals (aspect ratio 16:9 widescreen) sharp and truthful and the mono sound acceptable. There are a few extras, but nothing substantial. As the films script is based on a song I thought people might be interested in reading the lyrics which I reproduce here  laugh or cringe as you choose:

Convoy (lyrics: C.W.McCall and Chip Davis)
Arizona, noon, on the seventh of June
When they highballed over the pass
Bulldog Mack with a can on back
And a Jaguar haulin' ass
He's ten on the floor, stroke an' bore
Seatcover's startin' ta gain
Now beaver, you a-truckin' with the Rubber Duck
An' I'm about ta pull the plug on your drain
[Chorus]
'Cause we got a little ol' convoy
Rockin' through the night
Yeah, we got a little ol' convoy,
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the U-S-A
Convoy!
New Mexico I-four-oh
Like Texas lizard on grass
We were goin for broke
On a cloud of smoke with a thousand scream trucks
Sayin praise the Lord, shut the back door
And follow that Rubber Duck, ten-four
[Chorus]
'Cause we got a great big convoy
Rockin' through the night.
Yeah, we got a great big convoy,
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way.
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the U-S-A.
Convoy!
Texas dawn and the charge was on to the pits of Alvarez town
We had nine of our best comin' outta the west
And the ultimate hammer was down
Yeah, speed-trap city and we showed no pity
'Cause the whole damn place was a pile
We could tell by the smell it was trucker's hell
And the devil was Dirty Lyle
New Mexico, on I-four-oh
Like a Texas lizard on glass
One thousand pedals was mashin' the metal
Them bears was a-walkin' the grass
We trucked all day and we trucked all night
Pig Penny improvin' our style
We could tell by the smell
We was headin' for Hell
And the Devil was Dirty Lyle
Now Lyle was a creep,
He was tacky and cheap,
But he had him a badge an' a gun.
He hated the Duck and he hated his truck,
And he loved to bust truckers for fun.
So he followed the line,
And he bided his time,
And he watched for his chance to strike.
Then he picked on a trucker,
Yeah, a wiry ol' sucker,
Yeah, the trucker they call Spider Mike.
But the great Rubber Duck,
Sorta run outta luck
When he crossed that final bridge.
There's choppers and rigs full'a guns an' pigs,
They's wall-to-wall on the ridge.
He showed no fear as he grabbed his gear,
An' he stuck it in grandaddy low.
Them guns went boom,
An' his ass went zoom
An' the Mack took a terminal blow
Well, that big black Mack stopped dead in her tracks
When the trailer blew high in the air
There was pieces of truck and some pieces of Duck
And junk and debris everywhere
Then the rig took a drink an' commenced to sink
And there was no Duck no more
But that evil smile from Dirty ol' Lyle
Shone south from the north Texas shore

[Chorus]
'Cause we got a mighty convoy
Rockin' through the night.
Yeah, we got a mighty convoy,
Ain't she a beautiful sight?
Come on and join our convoy
Ain't nothin' gonna get in our way.
We gonna roll this truckin' convoy
'Cross the U-S-A.
Convoy!
Convoy! Ah, 10-4,
Convoy! Pig Pen, what's your twenty? Omaha? Well,
Convoy! they oughta know what to do with them hogs out there fer shure. Well, listen, good buddy,
Convoy! keep the bugs off'n your glass and the bears off'n your ass. We'll
Convoy! catch you on the flip-flop. This here's the Rubber Duck on the side. Southbound an' down.
Convoy! We gone. 'Bye,'bye.",1411516800,,7974,4.579831932773109

With Kris Kristofferson fresh off of a career performance in A Star is Born and Ali MacGraw a shining star after Love Story and Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway, Convoy added another great flick (after Smokey and the Bandit) to further document the great CB radio era of the 70's.

Yea - it's in wide screen (sort of).

When you play this DVD, it looks like someone transferred a VHS copy of the movie.  VERY low quality video.  Looks like MAYBE 280 lines of resolution.  Quad letterboxed as if the original was standard definition letterboxed to give correct resolution and then transferred to TRUE 16x9 from an SD source.

Super crappy video quality.  Super crappy audio quality.

What you have here is a DVD that got its source from something far less than DVD quality.  Like recording an LP onto a CD.  The LP has NOISE - the DVD does NOT have noise.  But what you get is a digitally clear, non-noise recording OF NOISE.

If you really like this movie - at least you get that.  But the quality couldn't be worse if they tried.

Edit to add:

Even within the constraints of 16:9 the picture is stretched; a poor conversion from 2.35:1 I'm guessing.  Audio is also out of sync with the picture, approx 1/2 second behind.  Very annoying.  In some cases audio is distorted, but this might be a limitation of the original source.

1206763,4,B00000F2Y6,"Convoy, 1978 film

We see a number of tractor-trailers traveling togther in a convoy. [This reduces the chance of any hijacking. Their highway seems to be a two-lane county road, not an interstate highway.] They are stopped by a County Deputy Sheriff for speeding. Will they pay a cash fine right now or be taken in for processing and lose days of work? Later they stop at a road-side diner. Deputy Sheriffs arrive to question these truckers. This is followed by a lot of action. The police come off second best. [Maybe this explains why this movie is seldom shown on TV. Are there such places out West?] Young women hang out in the diner to meet lonely truckers and go for a ride. After this the truckers head for the state line. [The end of railroads as prime freight carriers after the 1950s led to interstate trucking. They used oil, not coal.] A sharp turn causes one truck to overturn with its cargo of 6"" by 6"" lumber.

A fast-moving car goes off the road [to provide action]. These truckers want to take a back road to New Mexico to evade the Arizona police. CB radios are used for communication (no license required). Can the police catch these truckers? The sand kicked up on dirt roads acts like a smokescreen. A helicopter flying overhead has Federal Officers who order them to halt. No one answers. They are warned of a road block with twenty armed men down the road. But the lead truck is carrying explosives! They pass on by. An announcer says the Governor is interested in them (its an election year). There is a reference to Nixon and Watergate, plus other topics on economics. One trucker was arrested, beaten, and put in jail. Will he be used a bait? Can he be rescued? A CB message calls for help. The Governor shows up. Can he profit from their grievances? [Could this happen in real life?]

It is protest against the 55 MPH National Speed Limit. This affects truck transportation, which transports most of the goods shipped to people. It was not passed by popular request. [I know of the need to conserve fuel. The real cause was Nixons permanent devaluation of the dollar which led to less value for oil producers.] We hear the song that inspired this movie. One truck runs into a building and destroys it. This is repeated again. [This symbolizes an attack and destruction of the Establishment. I think it is unrealistic.] Now look what youve done! What good are you?

Does a badge make killing alright? The truck drivers then leave town. There is a minor accident whey they arrive at the next town. Rubber Duck slows for a road block, he is alone. He drops a passenger. An Army tank prepares to fire its machine gun. Built like a Mack truck? The tractor goes off the bridge, its trailer explodes and burns on the bridge. The other trucks sound their horns in mourning. The Governor compares truckers to the cowboys of olden days. He will support their cause when he is elected to the Senate. Others talk about him. The truckers leave to continue work. What next?

This movie is unusual in its populist (or anti-authoritarian) viewpoint. Its weakness is the characters portrayed as heroes. Would you like to be like the truckers or the cops, etc.? What is the problem with a National Speed Limit? For those who drive long distances it could mean the difference between getting home to their family or having to spend money at a cheap motel. The longer you drive the more tired your get (or have to take pills). Didnt the accident rate go up ?",1387411200,,3466,4.565916398713826

This is a movie to watch on a day when you just don't feel like thinking.  You just put the disc in the player, lay back, un-plug your brain and enjoy the ride.  It's very entertaining and it throws a nice punch at the corruption that many of us native southerners have seen for ourselves in some small town sheriffs.

1207137,4,B00000F2Y6,"1978's ""Convoy"" starring Kris Kristofferson and Ali MacGraw was directed by Sam Peckinpah.  He later worked on 1983's ""The Osterman Weekend"" but it was cut by the studio and is sadly, I consider, unfinished although it is in release.  ""Convoy"" is a fitting ending as it is based on the popular song by C.W. McCall and the screenplay is written by B.W.L. Norton and it provides Peckinpah with an excuse to use ""Convoy"" as a canvas on which he paints a mural of his slow-motion ballets of violence for which he is famous.  Far from his masterpieces like 1969's ""The Wild Bunch"" it is still worth seeing as everything by Peckinpah deserves to be seen, even ""The Osterman Weekend.""  He has worked with Kristofferson and Ali MacGraw before and they are joined by Burt Young, Madge Sinclair and Franklyn Ajaye and especially he again is working with Ernest Borgnine as the villain of the piece.  It is Peckinpah's film, but an admirable presentation of the song of which McCall should be proud.  I gave the DVD four stars as it is for Kinowelt's widescreen, uncut version which seems made on a computer and could be better, but I appreciate their presenting it uncut.  There are a number of other editions, several by Cheezy Flicks (even now a restored version), but the reviews were horrendous and they generally provide cheap editions which are only worth it because they don't cost much.  They are sacrifices to less quality.  Apparently United Artists, who initially released the film, did not think enough of it to provide better.  It is the only Peckinpah film to observe his treatment of film so radically like the art it is.  Graeme Clifford, who would later direct Jessica Lange in ""Frances,"" was editor and director of photography was Harry Stradling, Jr.  Kinowelt is a German company and the trailer as an extra is in German as is the menu and some copy of the back cover.  Moreso it is folklore than a great story, but grand Peckinpah.  ""Convoy"" deserves a bravura presentation, but this will have to do.",1339632000,,2011,4.724928366762177

1207170,1,B00000F2Y6,"Greetings.

For those who demand a viewing of Convoy, HD TV film channels have added Convoy, uncensored, uninterrupted, and a vivid presentation, to schedules.  Next showing, Monday, December 5th, USA.  (I send this on Nov. 28th).  Convoy background can be read on the Internet, including Wikipedia.  Commentators fail to grasp both the song Convoy's and the film Convoy's essential element:  that the truckers presented are private contractors breaching contracts by not delivering loads.  The ""Rubber Duck"" payload is one of those payloads destroyed in the course of truckers absconding across state lines with loads those drivers contracted to deliver.  How might ""Rubber Duck"" compensate those whose load he destroyed, and the jurisdictions in which his destructive acts caused personal, property and environmental damages?  Convoy, as song and film, is immature action without consideration of consequences.  Credited Director (see Wikipedia for back-story) Sam Peckinpah's cartoon film, using many of his prior film performers.

1207173,5,B00000F2Y6,"Movie is great, bought it for husband, who remembers going to movies with his parents to watch it. The title says it all. Simple story line, It's about truckers, a cop who hates truckers and will try anything to put them in jail, and altercation which cause some trucker friends to join together to head for the bordering state to possibly get out of cops jurisdiction, along the way other truckers start joining in which cause a very long line of semi-trucks hence the title ""Convoy"".",1312761600,,485,4.651162790697675

But overall it is very watchable. The next flaw has to do with the running time. The movie actually runs about 112 minutes (I still have my vhs copy).The dvd runs 5 minutes shorter. The problem I see is from the mastering of the sound. Seems to run a little faster than normal. Both Ali McGraw's and Burt Ward's voices sound a little higher than in the original. If you can look past that, then this is an ok deal. Will just have to wait til someone actually remasters this properly.",1312329600,2,631,4.401709401709402

Yes, Cheezy Flicks' two versions-- as discussed roundly here-- are second-rate in terms of video and audio quality, and Kinowelt does offer a somewhat sharper picture (though still grainy and a bit dark) with the aspect ratio corrected, but be aware that the latter's disc is DVD-R format, which generally is considered inferior for repeated viewings and may not work at all in some players.

I'm not sure, but wasn't this movie released in stereo? To some things up here, I thought this was a decent copy of a movie that was made in 1976. Though $20 is steep for a copy, it's a pretty good copy and I haven't been unable to find an original DVD release of the film ""Convoy"".

The other time was with ""Andy Warhol's Bad"" which wasn't that great a movie but that disc had all kinds of skips and pauses that I had to throw it in the trash.  This disc isn't as bad as all that but the flick is muddy and the sound isn't that great.  Panned on initial release by the critics the film deserves to be reevaluated in light of director Sam Peckinpah's body of work.  Certainly not one of his best but is a piece with his repertoire.  This film reminded me of ""The Getaway"" on a more cartoonish level.  This was released in the Summer of '78 and it works on a non-think level.  Sam seems to be having a lot of fun here.  You don't necessarily have to see Peckinpah's other work to enjoy ""Convoy"".

1207386,4,B00000F2Y6,"""Convoy,"" the 1978 action trucker flick, is one of those movies you like but are afraid to admit to. It's the kind of tape you hide in the closet when friends are over. I first saw this crash epic at the theater as a kid and sat through it a second time because I liked it so much. Time has only slightly worn down my admiration, but in terms of the trucker genre, it's still the best.

Ah, the 1970s, those days of CB handles,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokey-and-the-Bandit-Special-Edition/dp/B000EQHXOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokey and the Bandit - Special Edition</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Line-Fever/dp/B000RPM9H0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Line Fever</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaker-Breaker/dp/B00004ZBVH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaker, Breaker</a>. Can you believe we flocked to the theater in droves to see these films? ""Convoy"" came out at the tail end of this pedal-to-the-metal hoopla, about the time the song ""Movin' On"" was included on the B-side of all of those K-tel LPs. The film's director was the one and only Sam Peckinpah, now closing in on the end of a turbulent career. He was suffering from addictions and barely functioning as a professional. Yet even through the haze of alcohol and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wild-Bunch-The-Original-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BT96CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wild Bunch - The Original Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;dreams, shreds of his wonderful talent can be seen. It's ironic that a film considered the worst of his career is the best of a genre (fans of Jonathan Demme's fine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citizens-Band/dp/6300216918/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citizens Band</a>&nbsp;may disagree).

""Convoy"" is a muscle epic, with a genuine attempt at portraying the gritty lifestyle of truckers. I like Kris Kristofferson in the lead role, a brooding presence who makes a fine hero. I have always had problems with trucker films because the actors never really seemed appropriate for their roles (with the exception of Jerry Reed, of course). Kris is just right, exuding a sort of blue collar charisma that fits the role like faded jeans and a dirty red bandanna. The supporting cast is unusually excellent, including Ernest Borgnine in fine villainous form, Burt Young, Franklyn Ajaye and Madge Sinclair as salt-of-the-earth truckers, and even a distracted Ali MacGraw jogging around in bell bottoms and mini-fro.

The movie, based on the kitschy hit song by C.W. McCall&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/C-W-McCall-Greatest-Hits/dp/B000001FE3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">C.W. McCall - Greatest Hits</a>, is about a trucker who runs afoul of a surly cop and then forms a convoy of trucks to escape corruption, jail, whatever. There's a few subplots, including a governor who wishes to tout trucker rights, a jailbreak somewhere in Texas and eventually a standoff with the National Guard on the Mexican border. It all sounds like a Marty Robbins' song.

The cinematography by Harry Stradling Jr. is extraordinary, taking full advantage of the on-location vistas of New Mexico and Arizona. There's also a barroom fight and a car crash that must rank as the finest ever put on film. And you even have salty lines of dialog straight from the cynical pen of Peckinpah - ""Mann Act's for 18 year olds, not someone who's seen the better side of thirty!"" Or my favorite, when Kristofferson is asked what's the purpose of a convoy, ""Purpose of a convoy is to keep movin'.""

Poor Sam, in the throes of alcoholism, struggled mightily during the making of this movie, and it still performed well at the box office. Never-the-less, his career was in ruins after ""Convoy."" He would make one more film before riding off into the western sunset. Not many people involved with ""Convoy"" are fond of it due to the problems during production. But what a party it must have been.

If you squint your eyes just right and laugh at its absurdity, the wind-blown pages of this mediocre screenplay possess poetry of haunted men chasing ghosts down highways of the American southwest. ""Convoy"" is an example of A-list talent tackling C-list material, the end result being a unique film that raises the level of a crude genre.",1230163200,3,4529,6.003095975232198
1207387,5,B00000F2Y6,"Much better than the other CRAP versions, picture was the correct aspect ratio (everyone's not stretched too skinny)and it includes the stuff that was cut out of the others, like where they are interviewing the truckers in the convoy.. in the other ones some of them are edited out.. and the guy mooning the reporter is cut out.. but in this one it's all there and COMPLETE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The sound was good but it's Dolby Digital Mono.. so it's not a Stereo soundtrack... I looked it up on IMDB and it says it right there in the filming specs that the movie was shot in Mono.. so there can never be a true Stereo track for it.. that was kind of a bummer.. because it makes it seem a little low and had to turn it up a bit more than normal.. but at least it was Dolby Digital Mono so they cleaned it up some.

I had bought the Cheezyflicks one a few years ago and it was just plain terrible.. it would lock up and freeze and the picture quality when it did play was terrible..

1207394,1,B00000F2Y6,"I made the mistake of buying the CheezyFlicks DVD of Convoy. This movie was shot in Panavision which is an anamorphic process whereby the camera lens ""squeezes"" the image horizontally to fit in a normal 35mm frame. The picture is then ""unsqueezed"" to an aspect ratio of 2.4:1 by the projection lens.

The ""widescreen"" CheezyFlicks DVD has an aspect ratio of about 1.85:1 and the image remains ""squeezed"" so that everything -- people, trucks, scenery -- is shown at about half its proper width. The distortion is so great as to make this DVD unwatchable. I would have given it zero stars if Amazon permitted.

There is no excuse for putting out a DVD in this manner. Pan and scan (""full screen"") would have been better -- at least the half of the original image that was on the screen wouldn't be distorted.

If this is an example of the integrity of CheezyFlicks then their products should probably be avoided. I certainly won't be buying any more of them.

Please don't write me off as one of those ""purists"" who enjoy nitpicking over aspect ratios. The problem with this disc is not the aspect ratio, but rather the gross distortion of the image.",1220227200,2,1148,4.640394088669951

1207430,4,B00000F2Y6,"I picked up a copy of ""Convoy"" from the bargain bin at my local Wal-Mart the other day and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality from Cheezy Flicks. I've never heard of Cheezy Flicks so I wasn't sure what to expect from a low budget video company. This review is for the Feb 19/08 DVD release of ""Convoy"" from Cheezy Flicks. After viewing ""Convoy"" I can say that there is nothing wrong with the video and sound quality from Cheezy Flicks. Either the original print was in really good shape or Cheezy Flicks spent some money on cleaning it up for their 2008 DVD release.

Filmed one year after ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Breaker-Breaker"" the film stars Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, Burt Young and Ernest Borgnine. Kris Kristofferson really shines as trucker ""Rubber Duck"" and Ernest Borgnine is at his very best as the mean and very corrupt cop appropriately nicknamed ""Dirty Lyle"". While Burt Young gives a good performance as Pig Pen / Love Machine the same can't be said for Ali MacGraw. Her character Melissa doesn't really add anything to the movie and her performance is average at best.

Based on the song ""Convoy"" by C.W. McCall and directed by the legendary Sam Peckinpah this 1978 Drive-In classic still manages to entertain thirty years later. The disc packaging has professional look to it and Cheezy Flicks should be commended on the job they did releasing ""Convoy"" on DVD. The film is Region 1 coded and is presented in Letterbox format and it runs approximately 106 minutes.

It also states on the front cover that this version of ""Convoy"" is a Special Edition and the film has been Digitally Remastered. If you're a fan of trucker movies you won't be disappointed with this one. Unless one of the Major Studios re-releases ""Convoy"" on DVD this is probably the best it's ever going to look and sound. That's a big `10-4' good buddy over and out!

1207431,2,B00000F2Y6,"Somewhat surprisingly, the watchable but completely forgettable Convoy was the biggest hit of Sam Peckinpah's career, though by all accounts Peckinpah was so stoned on drugs and booze throughout the shoot that he directed little of it, with assistants and James Coburn filling in on the many occasions he couldn't get up the enthusiasm to leave his trailer. It's the kind of film that makes Smokey and the Bandit 3 look substantial and is pretty much a shoo-in as Peckinpah's worst film. There is one good almost balletic sequence of police cars running off dusty backroads set to the accompaniment of a semi-classical version of the C.W. McCall country-and-western song (originally written as a jingle) that provided what little inspiration there was for the film and some good support from Madge Sinclair's Widow Woman. But you can't help feeling that it's straining for significance a bit at times to hide the thinness of it all - truckers are the last of the real cowboys, just tryin' to live free without rules or reasons, don'tcha know - and that it would have been a whole lot more fun with Burt Reynolds and Jackie Gleason in the Kris Kristofferson and Ernest Borgnine roles. On the plus side at least the action scenes are better handled than in The Killer Elite, although even here some of the signature slow-motion here seems almost accidental, with some scenes fuzzily step-printed in post-production to slow them down (presumably because the few big stunts happened too fast to register onscreen) sticking out like a stylistic sore thumb amid the clarity of the much more effective sequences shot in genuine in-camera slow motion.

A word of warning on the DVD too - the English-language territory releases all omit the three-minute sequence of the governor's aide interviewing the truckers which contains Peckinpah's cameo as one of the camera crew. The German DVD is the uncut version with English soundtrack, though the 2.35:1 transfer is not very good quality.",1203206400,,1977,5.009118541033435

STARRING: Convoy is a 1978 action film directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, Ernest Borgnine and Burt Young. The movie is based on the 1975 country and western and novelty song ""Convoy"" by C.W. McCall. It is considered a member of the CB Radio/trucker film genre which rose to prominence in the 1970s following the success of Smokey and the Bandit, White Line Fever and the television series Movin' On.

SUMMARY: Truck driver Martin ""Rubber Duck"" Penwald (Kristofferson) comes into conflict with Sheriff ""Dirty Lyle"" Wallace (Borgnine). Rubber Duck and his trucker friends, Pig Pen (Burt Young), Spider Mike (Franklyn Ajaye) and Black Widow (Madge Sinclair), get into a fight with Wallace and his deputies at a truck stop. After handcuffing Wallace to a barstool, they decide to head for the state line to avoid prosecution. Melissa (MacGraw), a photographer whose car has broken down, agrees to ride with the Rubber Duck, and the pair soon falls in love. The truckers drive across Arizona and New Mexico, with Wallace in belated pursuit. Additional independent truckers join them to form a mile-long convoy in support of the Rubber Duck's vendetta against the abusive Wallace. The truckers communicate with each other via CB Radio, and much of the jargon associated with the CB craze is sprinkled throughout the film. The trip touches on social empowerment issues of class, race and gender as well as the place of the law in society. As the rebellious truckers run from the police, Rubber Duck becomes a reluctant folk hero. It becomes apparent the truckers have a great deal of political support and the Governor of New Mexico, Jerry Haskins (Seymour Cassel), meets Rubber Duck. At about the same time, Wallace and Alvarez, a brutal Texas sheriff, arrest Spider Mike, who left the convoy to be with his wife after giving birth to their son. Wallace's plan is to trap Rubber Duck. A janitor at the jail, unaware of the plan, messages by CB radio that Spider Mike has been arrested and beaten. Various truckers relay the message to New Mexico.

QUESTIONS: Why did Governor Jerry Haskins want to meet with the Rubber Duck? Why was Spider Mike in jail? Why did some of the other truckers join the Rubber Duck and head to East Texas? Why was Wallace and the National Guard called in on this situation?

MY THOUGHTS: This was a good truckers movie. Once again this was the type of movie that kept you on the edge of your seat. However once again in my eyes this movie had no leading lady. Based on the action and no leading lady I give this movie 45 weasel stars.",1171497600,,2646,4.808791208791209

1207532,4,B00000F2Y6,"If you like truck driving & older shows such as BJ & The Bear, then you should like this dvd. Kris Kristofferson is outstanding in my opinion as the Rubber Duck lead driver in the movie. Point of the movie is to show the hatred there was toward truckers by cops in the late 70's as the head Sherriff in the movie (Lyle Wallace AKA Smoky Bear played by Ernest Borgnine) doesn't seem to have anything better to do with his time than ride around harrassin them. The only flaw the movie has is the piss poor acting job done by Ali McGraw, I mean she was just absolutely terrible. She looked like crap and spoke her lines like she was reading it right off the transcript for the first time. This movie was being shot around the time when Sally Fields & Burt Reynolds were just gettin started so she was obviuosly unavailable. If you like trucking enough though like I do, you can find a way to look past her (McGraw) and just enjoy the movie.",1123372800,8,937,4.269662921348314
1207533,3,B00000F2Y6,"The ""Smokey and the Bandit"" target audience never knew what hit them when they went to see ""Convoy"". Used to a diet of direct-to-drive-in films they had no conception of what could happen when Hollywood threw big bucks and a competent (if distracted) director at the genre. What they got was something that movie historians are still trying to classify. A movie based on a CB radio song that morphed into a poetic homage to machinery; where trucks are turned into mythological monsters and filmed cruising through the heat-radiating desert to a score of classical music.

Why Sam Peckinpah elected to take on this project has really never been explained, although that decision certainly supports those tales of substance abuse, and the final cut is bizarre enough to also fit that explanation. It is an amazing film as it wobbles between self-parody and self-importance to a degree never seen before and never seen again until ""Apocalypse Now"". I'm not sure how much attention and interest Peckinpah actually showed toward the making of ""Convoy"". It has the disjointed feel of multiple directors or of a Director of Photography filling in many times when Sam was not motivated to make an appearance on the set.

Kris Kristofferson is fine as trucker ""Rubber Duck"" although Earnest Borgnine pretty much steals the whole thing.

But ""Convoy's real claim to fame is as the film where Ali MacGraw's career spectacularly crashed and burned. She did not just fade away but shattered into a million pieces. MacGraw got into acting in her late twenties but looked young enough to be believable as a college-age girl in her first two starring roles; the excellent ""Goodbye Columbus"" and the pathetic but hugely popular ""Love Story"". Her age worked to her advantage as her two characters (particularly ""Goodbye's"" Brenda) came off as poised, stylish, classy and smart. She picked up a huge following of male viewers who would have bought tickets to anything she was in and she was generally inoffensive to female viewers. She was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar, started fashion crazes, and made the cover of Time magazine. She also picked up the head of Paramount Studios (Robert Evans) as a husband dedicated to advancing her acting career. It was a done deal that she would get the lead in ""Chinatown"", a role that would fit her rather limited range (poised, classy, stylish). Her only obstacle was managing the transition to middle age in a way that her smitten fans could accept.

Unfortunately she dumped Evans for a short marriage (5 years) to Steve McQueen. Just how badly her image and career were managed after she left Evans is illustrated by her bad haircut in ""Convoy"". Just glance at the promotional poster and you may be able to hear the sounds of a million bubbles bursting in the minds of her male fans. The idea of ""Brenda"" playing a truck stop mama with short curly hair would have made it too painful to even contemplate seeing this movie. Her fan base literally melted away with the start of the film's promotion campaign. They never returned, the illusion had died. Ironically had they actually seen her horrible performance in ""Convoy"" they might have felt better, as the performance is so absurd it achieves a sort of surreal quality. But a couple years later they discovered replacement Jennifer Beals and moved on.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1114214400,17,3384,4.8765217391304345

The DVD version of this scene has a broken conversation with the Duck, then the Preacher, and back to the Duck. In addition to this the sound quality is not that great and a few times it is mute for a second. At the very beginning of the movie the video jumps once or twice but is good for the most part.

This is one of the best movies from the 70s.  Kris Kristopherson plays ""The Rubber Duck,"" the leader of a truck convoy across the U.S.A.  The convoy communicates via CB radio.  For those of you old enough to remember, CB radio was huge in the late 70s.  When the speed limit on highways was lowered to an overly oppresive 55 mph, truckers (and most other highway drivers) snapped up as many CB radio systems as they could - they would communicate via CB whenever they saw cops.
Convoy is all about these disgruntled truckers and their CBs.  Kris Kristopherson fights back against the cops and takes his convoy on a cross-country trip.  Kris is the most aggrieved of the bunch - Ernest Borgnine plays a cop who sets false speed traps just so he can harass Kris and give him tickets and grief.

1207623,5,B00000F2Y6,I love the movie Convoy. Enve though I'm only 17 I have seen this movie atleast 200 times and am Displeased to find i can no longer order it. Having missed the chance to buy it long ago i am stuck in a rut. I can not find this classic anywhere. I think it is one of the top 10 movies of all time and if you have any info on where i can get my own copy please post or e-mail me.,1017360000,4,377,3.5542168674698793
1207624,5,B00000F2Y6,My wife heard the song Convoy by C.W. McCall for the first time in years. I had to explain to her some of the reasons behind the song and the movie. This movie was a social statement of the times and has become a classic like Animal House. I was very disappointed when I went on line and could not find it.,1016323200,,306,3.9516129032258065
1207625,5,B00000F2Y6,"I really liked it. I would love to see it re-released on VHS and DVD. Loved the music, not many people know that the music was written by the same man that does Mannheim Steamroller, Chip Davis.
  Its about an independent trucker (Kristofferson) who starts out by running from the local sherrif after a fight at the Silver Cloud Truck Stop. Later trucks continue to join his Convoy. Each trucker has his own reasons for joining. It becomes a national phenomenon before the National Guard steps in to break it up.
  I recomend it and I encourage everyone to speak up for its re-release!",1011225600,,585,4.596153846153846

I was young when the film was released so it has become part of my childhood.  Like Starsky and Hutch and The Dukes of Hazard, when watched as an adult you laugh, but it still brings back fun memories.  Convoy represents the 70's and the way we thought at the time.  A great truck driving movie about standing for your beliefs no matter what the cost.  How can you argue with that?  And lets not forget that you can purchase Saturday Night Fever on DVD... Talk about a stupid movie.  If you want to call a movie bad lets be happy most people forgot about Xanadu!",1001116800,15,699,4.203007518796992
1207649,2,B00000F2Y6,"C.W. McCall's 1975-76 #1 hit song ""Convoy"", about a group of truckers united against law enforcement abuse, while very vivid and full of redneck wit, simply could never have made for a very good film, no matter who directed or starred in it.  The fact that the man behind the camera is Sam Peckinpah, the man behind such superb and disturbing films as THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS, just makes it pitiful.  There's no point to the story.  Subliminally, Peckinpah knew it--but drugged and boozed as he was, he never showed his disgust loud enough.
Even given the appearances of such actors as Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, and Ernest Borgnine, CONVOY is an unfortunate terrible clinker, the nadir of a director's career.  It should be seen, but don't expect anything near the quality of Peckinpah's earlier films.",999561600,3,815,4.884057971014493

1207653,1,B00000F2Y6,"The 1970's were known to produce some of the most horrible films of all time.  To be sure, it was a premiere time for those totally without any sense of taste or discretion in movies.  Enter, this movie.
Basically, this is one (among numerous) [bad] movies that Kris Kristofferson did.  A failed country singer, and even worse of an actor, he is redeemed only by the fact that he wrote some of the greatest angst-ridden country tunes to date (i.e., ""Sunday Morning Coming Down,"" ""Bobby McGee,"" etc.).  But just as he cannot sing..., he can't act.  I don't care if Waylon, Willie and Johnny (and even Merle) all call him a friend.  He's pathetic.  This role could have been better acted by Don Knotts (aka Barney Fife, Fife the Fierce, Fast-Gun Fife, Crazy-gun Barney, etc.).
Who...knows the real point of this movie.  Each of the dimwits who joins the convoy thinks the message being sent is unique to them.  One sees it as a statement of the oppression of blacks (particularly those who fought in Vietnam and then came home to ""live in the ghetto."").  Yet another sees it as a statement against OPEC and the gas-crises of the 1970's.  Whatever.  Get a life, as well as some taste.
It boils down to this.  This movie picked a genre that was popular and short-lived in the 1970's and exploited it.  CB movies and trucker movies (and car movies) were all the rage back then.  Enter ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" ""Duel,"" etc.  Some of the most horrible movies ever made.  Each showing Hollywood fools trying to capitalize on the thrill of the moment. ""Smokey"" acheived alot in that department, capitalizing on cars, trucks, and cb's.  [You'll also notice a troubling obsession with great disaster movies and creature movies back then as well (i.e., ""Earthquake,"" ""Ants,"" ""Bees,"" and dare I say it, yes ""Jaws,"" etc.).]
There is a REASON this isn't available in any form--it's not the result of some great conspiracy to deprive the world of some great art piece.  If so, gearjammers unite and construct a convoy to protest against the failure of ""convoy"" to be released.  Otherwise, see the big picture and know that it is buried (hopefully VERY deep) because it never derserves to see the light of day again.
10-4 good buddy.  Want a real classic?  Go get ANY movie with Steve McQueen (particularly ""Bullit,"" ""The Great Escape,"" or ""Le Mans"") or get any of the following:  ""Cool Hand Luke,"" ""One-Eyed Jacks,"" ""Billy Jack,"" or ""Easy Rider."" That will at least give you a good START.",990057600,2,2472,4.7109557109557105
1207654,5,B00000F2Y6,"Of all the trucking movies filmed, Convoy has to be the premier!  What amazes me is that one can obtain any one of the other trucking movies to come out of the '70's and '80's, yet convoy remains elusive like the finest of gems.  Convoy relates to the trucking industry as much today as it did when first released.  Unlike the others, Convoy remains a true classic.  I rate convoy as the best trucking movie to come out of Hollywood, ever.  BRING THIS MOVIE BACK!!!",986688000,,465,4.423529411764706

It definately has some great scenes and Kristofferson is as handsome as ever. There are not enough movies about trucking and without trucks where would America be?

7907492,4,B00000F2Y6,"I thought this would have stood up to the test of time better than it has. It is the movie that many of us who saw in theaters still talk about. Maybe it is because the song is so catchy and we have memories of 'rubber ducky' on the radio and the cb talk.

Here is what I know having watched it recently with my thirteen year old son. He wanted to see it after hearing the song on the radio.
It is much slower moving than  movies made today. Parts that I remember as exciting are really not so much exciting anymore.

It is still funny and the cb talk is still entertaining. But without all of the special effects that you can see in movies today, this movie is much slower paced than I remember it being.
