8302480,5,B001FRNB8U,"Seeding of a Ghost gives asian horror its very well deserved mystique. It is exactly what you expect a movie from this genre,Evil Dead 2013 was clearly inspired by Seeding of a Ghost but not as good. Asian horror movies from the 1970s and 80s burst with an energy and freshness no horror/scifi can provide today. I get a copy before the dvd goes out of print.",1375401600,3,359,4.373134328358209
8302481,3,B001FRNB8U,"I have been putting this off for a few years (I have had the DVD since 2009) mainly because I thought it was going to be shockfest that outdid The Boxer's Omen in gonzo-style horror. Well it was not even close to The Boxer's Omen which still holds a place deep in the suppressed subconscious of my cranium (actually it is more weird and gross than actually scary). In fact this has to be one of the most overstated and overhyped horror films of Hong Kong though this is not a horrible film.

Chow (Phillip Ko: The Boxer's Omen, Shaolin Intruders) interrupts black magic by inadvertently saving the life of a black magic priest who is being chased down by an angry mob. Because of this the priest says at best he will get very sick and at worst his whole family will die. Since this is a horror film we know which scenario is going to take place. A film with him just being sick would not be as fun. But it is especially hilarious that it seems that the angry mob gets off clean and that he picked up the priest far from where the incantation went awry. I am probably over-thinking this.

Chow's wife Irene has been cheating on him because of his lowly taxi driver job, taxi drivers are a deranged lot (ask Anthony Wong), and his hair (seriously one of the worst wigs I have seen, worse than a Sammo Hung haircut). She is enticed by playboy Anthony Fong Ming (Norman Chu Siu-Keung: Bastard Swordsman) who visits her job of dealing cards and showers her with money, gifts, better hair (to be fair to Phillip check out Norman's perm in Hong Kong Godfather) and affection. One night those two adulterers have a fight and she gets out of the car and goes off by herself. Never good to be alone late at night when ruffians are about. She is confronted by two young hooligans who chase her down, one rapes her and ultimately she gets killed (why she runs into an abandoned house I do not know, why there would be an abandoned house in an abandoned area Hong Kong I also do not know).

When Chow finds out she is dead, he is ultimately a suspect for about 15 seconds. Fong is another suspect and despondent Chow finds out about the affair. He gets bad ideas in his head and wants revenge at all costs for those involved and goes to the black magic priest (still dressed like a shirtless jungle native; I wonder if he goes to the store like that) to seek revenge. This requires that they dig out his wife's corpse and he is warned that his monomaniacal revenge will likely result in his demise as well. The corpse is used quite effectively and it is creepy, the most scary aspect of the film. You can see it on the cover of the DVD and poster.

Fans of horror could do worse by seeking this out. I do not think it is as unique/interesting/gratuitous as Black Magic or The Boxer's Omen out of the Shaw Brothers horror oeuvre and I would suggest seeking those out first. This film overdoes the sleazy exploitation aspect of it, elongates the nudity and the film comes off more as a voyeuristic exercise especially in the beginning which starts to drag on. The slow motion topless running scene becomes almost absurd in its length and its use of the zoom lens. But you do get the benefit of a few fight scenes decently done involving Phillip Ko (still mad about the outcome with Norman Chu) who proves once again that you should not mess with taxi drivers or Phillip Ko. You also get a variety of gross out moments, Taoist priests, scares all done better in a variety of Hong Kong films. However, when the ghost is seeded there are plenty of horror elements, while keeping the exploitation element alive, especially towards the finale that will be of interest to viewers. There you get to witness a creature that seems inspired by John Carpenter's The Thing while a segment from the soundtrack from Alien is played.

I have the R1 Image release and it has English and Spanish subtitles. It comes with the Mandarin mono dub only. The R3 IVL release comes with both the Cantonese and Mandarin dub. At the time of the Hong Kong audience would have heard the Cantonese soundtrack, but most of the transnational audience would have heard it in Mandarin. Since at the time post dubbing was the norm and multiple dialects were often used on set it does not matter as much to me. However, this is a controversial topic where some have to have the ""preferred"" dub. I personally would like a release from this time period to have both the Cantonese and Mandarin language, but I will take what I can get. There are plenty of the Image released Shaw Brothers trailers (not the original trailers) on this release, but no trailer for the movie.",1320278400,3,4618,4.447461629279811
8302482,5,B001FRNB8U,"It seems that almost any film made in the eighties is better than the crap we get mostly today, in particular for horror fans. This was the last film in the Shaw Brother's ""Black Magic Trilogy"" (1975 Black Magic and 1983 Boxers Omen) and made in 1983 it was a gore effects gooey rubber splatterfest. No CGI here we have guts, blood, magic wizards, naked bodies, rotten corpses, and supernatural necrophilla...wow. Although the horror is really too over the top to be scary, it is still fun to watch the wacky politically incorrect monster effects sorry ladies. I have read some reviews that compare it to John Carpenters ""The Thing"" and ""Evil Dead"" but it might be actually a little of both, gooey rubber tentacled monsters that morph out of random body parts like ""Thing"" and crazy horror lunacy like ""Evil Dead"". So sample the Asian craziness in a culture that makes it's films without a rating system and before Asian horror became nothing more than long haired groaning female ghosts.",1232064000,16,988,4.783625730994152
8302483,3,B001FRNB8U,"Tons of nudity,a corpse and weird gross rituals. Forget the plot you can read that in the editorial review from Amazon. If you like horror movies about unfaithful wives, possesion,and the dead then check this Chinese gore out. If you like sleaze then you should be satisfied. Just don't expect The Exorcist. Do expect nastiness and a silly,goofy,laughable goodtime worth watching at least once.",1229472000,7,394,5.171875
