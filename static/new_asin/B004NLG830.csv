8436751,5,B004NLG830,"Loved, loved, loved the DVDs, the pictures were so clear and crisp, quality was excellent, and best of all, the commercials were cut out and I could watch the whole movie all at once rather then having to wait the following week for the next episode, this compared to watching this series back in 1995...only thing, the English translations were a little off, good thing I understand Japanese but to a non-Japanese understanding person...oh well, guess they wouldn't know the difference...thank you, thank you...also, your shipping time was so fast!",1314921600,,549,5.111111111111111
