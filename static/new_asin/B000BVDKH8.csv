I was glad to find it on Amazon because apparently, it was very difficult to find elsewhere.  Thanks!",1341878400,2,277,4.392156862745098

8093204,5,B000BVDKH8,"This is one of the best live DVDs I've seen in a long time!!! I love the interviews, the behind the scene stuff, and most of all I absolutely love the brilliant performances for both shows!!!  :) The video quality is very good, and the audio quality is awesome!!

For anyone who's a fan of Jesse Cook, Ottmar Liebert, and Strunz & Farah... this DVD is a must have.

Simply one of the best purchases I've ever made!!!

I would highly recommend this to any Nuevo Flamenco, World Music fan.

8093205,5,B000BVDKH8,"I knew JP Durand through high school.  As we approached our 20 high school year reunion, I learned he was in this band.  I couldn't help but be extremely curious since JP was always a great guitarist (at least he was in high school).  I was amazed to see just how far he's come, along with a terrific band...all amazing musicians who really seem to love what they are doing.

I was very impressed with the quality of the sound and the actual footage of the concerts (especially the Thousand Oaks concert which really captures the energy the music creates).  It is mesmerizing to watch.  They sound great, and the songs are beautiful.  JP and Band, I am very proud of your success and wish the band more good things to come in the future.

I only wish I could play guitar (or any instrument) as well as the members of Incendio can play!  Just a great DVD!",1151712000,5,854,4.3544303797468356
8093206,5,B000BVDKH8,"This DVD is an outstanding portrayel of the Fire and Passion that is Incendio. The band is caught in full flight as they take the veiwer on an exotic journey through many different styles and rhythms. The veiwer can partake in the energy projected from each of the band members in a way that was previously impossibe unless you were at an actual concert.

Incendio's ""Dia y Noche"" is a great way to bring the full Incendio expierence home to enjoy whenever the mood strikes. ""Dia y Noche"" is a must have for any Incendio fan and a great addition to any music collection.",1133740800,6,570,4.480769230769231
