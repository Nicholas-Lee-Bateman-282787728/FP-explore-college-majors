8299184,4,B001EOQWL2,"A beautiful film, depicting the life of a mother and her son trying to recover from the traumas the civil war has left in her family (the disappearance of her husband and father of her son).

The man's death declaration tears mother and son apart: the son has already accepted his father's absence, and moves on with his life trying to deal with his everyday problems; while the mother refuses to do so, still hoping that her man will come back one day, and his death declaration (wanted by the son) makes her realize her morning.

An interesting and sensitive film not on the Lebanese civil war dramas this time (such as the excellent ""West Beirut"") but on the post-war ones, marked to an ordinary family and its way of trying to cope with them.",1235088000,3,746,4.518518518518518
