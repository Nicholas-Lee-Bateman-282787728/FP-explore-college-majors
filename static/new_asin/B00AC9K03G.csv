In this exploration of profound loneliness and loss, Erik Peter Carlson miraculously has made a life-affirming, even inspiring film. Seamless camera work, gorgeous art direction/cinematography and truly challenging scenes help to bring us deep into the mind of an eccentric man who chooses an eccentric way to heal from his extraordinary trauma. Carlson has made a movie that subtly captures the essence of what we all love about cinema...that singular carnival ride that transports us into someone else's life experience.

My name is Randy Becker and I run NexTV Entertainment. We get thousands of submissions each year from emerging artists trying to make a mark on the list of significant industry players that we bring to our panels. TRANSATLANTIC COFFEE stands out not just because of the cohesive and compelling aesthetic or the challenging and topical subject matter, but because, at its core, it tells us a great story...one well worth experiencing.

5409033,3,B00AC9K03G,"This film has nothing to do with coffee. It's a love story wrapped in mystery, about two dysfunctional people who fall in love via the internet. The twist at the end makes watching this entire 'dramady' to it's conclusion a must.",1415664000,,229,4.609756097560975

5409035,4,B00AC9K03G,"I liked the actor and actress in the film. They were really well cast and talented. This director has a new film coming out, facebook.com/thetoysoldiers and this next film is much more mainstream, a full length feature film. Transatlantic Coffee more just for the indie crowd. I liked the theme, but of course not a lot was spent on the production. If you can stream it that would be good.",1394150400,2,389,4.571428571428571
5409036,5,B00AC9K03G,"From the writing to the directing and all the way down to the acting, this is a great looking and important film. Really enjoyed the music, the New York scenery, and the dark writing. Of course smaller movies like this won't be for everyone, and don't be fooled it's not so much a comedy as it is a dark dramatic movie. I don't know why it's written as a Comedy in some places. We may have laughed a handful of times the rest we were really moved and sad. I like this director and see he has another movie coming out.",1392854400,3,517,4.128712871287129
5409037,1,B00AC9K03G,"This movie is neither romantic nor funny. There is a lack of structure in this movie that is not at all redeemed by the dialogue. The actors are okay, I suppose, but the writing leaves much to be desired.",1388534400,,204,4.256410256410256

5409039,1,B00AC9K03G,"Consider me a genie in a bottle or a pseudo second-coming... this is a forewarning...

This movie lacks plot, direction, or humanity. It is more like a porno flick than an independent film. Roughly 30% of the movie is the main character chocking his chard.

Read a book, shave your mustache, or runaround in your wife's underwear... these are all better choices. If you watch this movie, Jesus will be laughing at you in your life review after you kick the bucket.

I've warned you.",1376784000,,482,4.647058823529412

5409041,2,B00AC9K03G,"After reading all the ""genuine"" five-star reviews -- talking about how ""crazy,"" the ending was, and how it would ""knock you for a loop,"" and was the ""best climax of my life,"" -- I was stoked.  As it turned out, all this gushing hyperbole that sounded a little too good to be true, was just that.  I seriously figured out what the ""huge"" twist was inside of fifteen minutes.

I did appreciate the fine performance by the male lead, but couldn't get over the female lead's transient accent.

I can also say that I did enjoy just about all of the music.",1375056000,,550,4.362745098039215
5409042,5,B00AC9K03G,"This was a great drama love story with a crazy twist. This is a must see............
I loved the movie beginning to end, the character development was beautiful and keeps you involved. Anyone that loves movies with a twist will enjoy this one.",1362614400,3,243,4.674418604651163
5409043,5,B00AC9K03G,"Great movie, never seen such a thing!
Gritty, dark, the director is great.
Drama, NYC, mind twisting.
Eric Peter Carlson made a great job in this movie, don't miss the opportunity to see it. Great independent film.",1355875200,3,214,4.8108108108108105
5409044,5,B00AC9K03G,"Just finished the movie. Excellent performances by the two main
characters. Soundtrack was great. Angel Eyes is one of my favorite
standards. I loved that Mandie wore Doc Martens. I love that they went
to Poughkeepsie, and you guys actually shot there. (My Hometown!) Love
the scene when they first get back to the apartment and talk about the
power of music. One of my groups is the performing the track in which
they are dancing too. I was pleased to see where you guys chose to use
our song. The entire scene is Wonderful. As a musician I loved how
music played a huge part in the film. Especially Jazz. I definitely see
why the film won soo many awards.",1355356800,4,657,4.43801652892562
5409045,5,B00AC9K03G,"It'll keep you engaged. It'll keep you wondering. You'll feel awkward, but its insightful raw-ness will you keep you planted in your seat. The dialogues will make you smile. The music and the scenes will lure you in. The ending...completely satisfying: not I just had good lunch satisfying, but I just had the best climax of my life satisfying.",1355356800,2,344,4.8474576271186445
5409046,5,B00AC9K03G,"It's a shame that most people will not be able to enjoy this gem in a theater, but the DVD is still well worth the price (especially since you'll want to watch the film a couple of times). The performances by the two leads (Kevin Pinassi and Rachel Marie Lewis) were superb, and the visuals and soundtrack add another layer of depth to a great film.

The story centers around a sad man's search to recapture happiness through his friendship with a young woman. It's a pretty dark tale, which is why it's well suited for a theater, but pick a rainy day or quiet evening and watch this film with someone else because you'll want to talk about it immediately.",1355097600,5,656,4.421487603305785
5409047,5,B00AC9K03G,"I have watched many(!!!) movies in my life (long time ago I happened to study film for 3 semesters), but without any exaggeration, I must say that Transatlantic Coffee is one of the best films I've ever seen. I ordered this movie a few days ago and got it last night. Although it was late, I put the movie on and then... I could not sleep for a long time. Transatlantic Coffee made me think.
All this Hollywood trash seems so shallow and predictable, especially when you compare it to those profound, beautiful, meaningful films made by unknown artists. Erik Peter Carlson, whoever you are, you're already one of my favorite movie directors.
I will watch this movie again and probably again and... again.
I will show it my friends and order another copy for my parents.",1354838400,2,769,4.62043795620438
5409048,5,B00AC9K03G,"This film had me from the start. It was easy to relate to the characters and their individual situations. Like all great films it kept me thinking. But there was an angle that caught me off guard and ultimately left me feeling snookered. This alone would have been worth the price, even if I had not enjoyed the film in it's entirety. BRAVO...",1354665600,4,343,4.4603174603174605
5409049,5,B00AC9K03G,"Transatlantic Coffee takes you on an amazing love adventure between a 41 year old clown named Alex and a teenage stripper named Mandie.  Both characters are battling inner demons.  Alex sees life through black and white and Alex is as colorful as a rainbow.  The director and writer Erik Peter Carlson uses vibrant energy with splashes of color as he takes you on an amazing journey of love, color, inner demons and knocks your socks off at the end leaving you in awe. Can this love affair work?  You have to see it with your own eyes.",1354665600,3,535,4.484536082474227
5409050,5,B00AC9K03G,"I have seen many independent films in my life, and just when I thought nothing on the big screen could surprise me anymore.  Transatlantic Coffee proved me wrong, not your standard romance film it's cinematography and  soundtrack are magical.  From the start, you fall in love with the characters in this movie.  The two main characters are seemingly complete misfits yet completely charming and awkward.  Alex, played by (Kevin Pinassi) I think there is an instant connection with this character; you can't help but adore him.  Mandie, quirky and clever girl played by (Rachel Marie Lewis), is adorably flawless.  A movie you can get lost in.... I anxiously await another Erik Peter Carlson film.",1354579200,3,697,5.06140350877193
5409051,5,B00AC9K03G,"From the first few seconds into the opening sequence of Transatlantic Coffee, I was hooked. The beautiful shots, the soulful melody of Alix Paige and expert use of lighting all blend together perfectly in setting the tone for this wonderful New York original.

We notice straight away that the man sat in a carefree New York City blues bar is troubled. His edgy disposition accompanied by jarring images of distant or recent memories flash on and off screen against the tempo of the music, portrays a man burdened with repressed thoughts that are invading his mind. As the opening sequence ends with a very high pitched drawn out noise, a speeding train races past a block of apartments, sharply bringing us back to Alex's morose reality.

The film begins quite slowly, establishing Alex (Kevin Pinassi) as a depressive, drunken man whose choice of employment, (providing entertainment as a clown), contrasts with his disdain for life and sullen nature. His longing desire to find someone that will allow him to escape from the constant loneliness he has submitted himself to, is where his story begins.
Over the course of this film, we're given the opportunity to tread in the footsteps of this lonely man's quest to feel love again. Set just a month after 9/11, Alex's story serves as a metaphor for the trauma New York citizens dealt with after the attack. The city itself; grey and in stasis, Alex also seems somewhat out of touch from reality. His hostility towards life, towards his family and his only friend are a result of his disconnection from society.

Early into the film we discover Alex has met a teenage girl from London online and has asked her to stay with him in The Big Apple. Mandie (Rachel Marie Lewis) is a high spirited stripper with a lust for living life to the fullest; a juxtaposing element to Alex's depressive lifestyle. Nevertheless, the couple spend several weeks together, bonding over different aspects of each other's personalities, and things begin to look up for Alex. The film however, constantly reminds us of how conflicting the individuals are.
A very poignant scene shows Alex and Mandie sat awkwardly making small talk to break the ice after weeks and weeks of relying on the social barrier of internet messaging. Alex, not wanting to give much of himself away, is hesitant to talk; Mandie on the other hand, makes herself comfortable as soon as she enters his apartment. As the airy tension between them rises, the music in the background becomes more dominant and Alex begins to describe how he associates music to memories, he feels that ""music is the one way you can capture a moment"" - this, to me, is just the epitome of his character and of the film. Music is very apparent in Transatlantic Coffee; it consistently sets the tone, the atmosphere and the mood of each character and each scene highlighting how Alex sees each moment of his life.

Alongside the usage of musical and visual cues, Transatlantic Coffee also utilises the concept of individual perception to explore another predominant theme; that of Alex and Mandie's attraction to one another despite their rather overwhelming differences. Alex, during a memorable moment whilst they stand looking over Manhattan at night, tells Mandie he is colour blind. Mandie responds with ""I'm so sorry...it must be horrible living in a city like New York and not being able to enjoy the colour and vibrancy of it all"" to which Alex states, ""Not really, it's all I've ever known"" - from this brief conversation we get to understand the characters a little better. With Alex's depressive nature and Mandie's colourful outlook on the world, they are `different in their own way'.

As the film progresses differences melt between the two. Mandie paints a picture for a close friend back home in England, when Alex sees this painting he realises he can see colour. He associates this new profound ability with the love he holds for Mandie and is therefore awakened from his black and white world; this reinforces Alex's need for her to be a part of his life.
The sexual tension between the two characters is admitted very early on, however Alex is hesitant to act upon his desires. The film pushes you to feel how real every situation is throughout the story and how the relationship shared between the two, is full of genuine emotion. Every glance, touch and embrace feels so honest and meaningful that all your senses tell you it's real.
This is a beautiful independent picture directed and written by Erik Peter Carlson. It focuses on visual energy and atmosphere created by spectacular cinematography, scenic locations, choreography and costume designs. The script highlights how beautiful life can be yet with the help of a well structured narrative; the storyline illustrates the ugliness that sometimes can creep through. The subtle flashbacks from Alex's memories and out of place lines were suggestive to the films conclusion, nevertheless they were almost unnoticeable. An almost flawless motion picture, Transatlantic is an independent wonder, enriched with fantastic colour, unforeseen twists and occasional eroticism.",1354492800,7,5125,4.982476635514018
5409052,5,B00AC9K03G,"While clearly there is a place for the mega-million budget films, there is in turn a definitive place for thought provoking and beautifully arranged independent film! Erik Carlson is able to capture both the beauty and tenderness of human beings, along with the ugliness and shallowness of them. And then, BOOM...hits you square between the eyes with an ending that makes you shake your head and reevaluate and question everything you just watched. It has fine acting and visually, is a cinematic beauty. I loved it and will certainly watch it again!! Can't wait to see what they have in store next.",1353888000,3,599,4.882352941176471
8549939,5,B00AC9K03G,"I just saw this film on amazon prime and it was so beautiful and exquisitely sad. It's meant to be hard to watch, it's brutally uncompromising in it's vision. His facial expression at the end physically hurt my heart. I loved this film!!!! I wish that someone had done an analysis that breaks down the symbolism in it. I would like to hear what other people's theories on the whole vampire thing were.  Here's to hoping this amazing film will reach cult classic status  I've been showing it to everyone. This is the type of movie that when you re-watch it, you will get something entirely different out of it.",1511481600,,609,4.527272727272727

8549945,1,B00AC9K03G,"I decided to watch this because it had a 4 star rating.  This is the last time I'll do that, unless there are hundreds of ratings. I'll bet a lot of the people that gave this a 5 star rating were either: related to someone in the movie, or have a financial interest in the movie.  This movie sucked!  The main character is a loser.  His mother is portrayed as a bigoted, judgmental Christian, a part which has been so over done in movies, that it makes me wonder why these movie writers can't come up with more original characters.  If you have problems with Christians, get over it.  This is getting so old!  The last two minutes of the movie gives you the explanation as to why Alex is such a crack pot, but at this point, after suffering through this boring movie, it's too little too late.  Don't waste your time.  You'll get more satisfaction watching paint dry.",1447545600,,867,4.36875
8549946,4,B00AC9K03G,"I love indie films that are about real characters, but often the movie bogs down because of a lackluster story.  In this case, i was held in my chair thoughout, and i doubt i will ever forget the male lead--just stellar.",1437264000,,220,4.365853658536586
8549947,3,B00AC9K03G,"Moments of brilliance bursting from banality.  Pinassi's performance is stellar.  I had real problems with Lewis who plays Mandy.  She's a wonderful actor, but a bit long in the tooth for the role of an underage girl.  Her ""British"" accent was all over the place -- it seemed as if she couldn't decide if she were Mary Poppins or Eliza Doolittle.  This may have been intentional after the final scene reveals all.  Same goes with the visit to Alex's parents.  The film began to bog down for me three quarters of the way through, but I decided to stick it out, and I am glad I did.  The payoff makes the not-so-brilliant moments very well worth the time invested.",1434153600,,662,4.504201680672269
