5584114,5,B00BEGZS8S,"This is a great package....  I bought this movie for the blu-ray copy of Rio Bravo.  I have watched all of the films and must say they are all very different.  Pale Rider is not one of Eastwood's best, but really pops with blu-ray.  How the west was won is just short of fantastic and one that if you have not watched it you really should.  The Wild Bunch is gritty and really worth the price of the set just by it self.  Last buy not least ""The Searchers""  is in my mind one of the best ""Wayne/Ford"" Films ever made.  You cannot got wrong with this set and the price is really great.",1413676800,13,584,4.06140350877193
5584115,3,B00BEGZS8S,Not bad for the money but does not have the quality of American made Blu-ray.  Colors are off but for the price it's not bad.  Not quite sure where these are made but it is made in a Latin Country.,1412640000,5,197,3.9
5584116,5,B00BEGZS8S,"I bought this set mainly for the Rio Bravo movie that is part of this set. That alone costs more than this entire set so it was a good value for me. Of the others in the set, my next favorite is How The West Was Won, with a ton of stars playing various parts. Good epic movie to watch. The Blu-ray quality is very good on all of these, naturally better that any DVD versions.",1400457600,17,375,3.9473684210526314

8566968,1,B00BEGZS8S,Returned for not working in either of my DVD players.,1486944000,,53,4.4
8566969,5,B00BEGZS8S,"If you like good westerns, this is an excellent choice. When growing up, most westerns were made for the imaginations and mo0ral guides for children. These are for adults:-)",1477958400,4,173,5.0
8566970,4,B00BEGZS8S,"""How The West Was Won"" was the main drawcard of this collection, however the film that has stuck with me most is ""The Searchers"". I grew up in the 80s and early 90s, and John Wayne was just ""that old guy"" on Saturday midday re-runs. However watching ""Rio Bravo"" and ""The Searchers"" (apparently two of his better works) as an adult, it's easy to see the manly appeal and on-screen presence John Wayne had; which contributes to those movies' success. ""How The West Was Won"" is pretty good especially for the unique cinematography. Since buying this collection I've picked up some other western films - can recommend ""Shane"", ""True Grit"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (probably my overall favourite) too.",1447113600,5,706,4.747967479674797
8566971,4,B00BEGZS8S,This was a gift to a true fan of western movies. He liked it.,1437436800,,61,3.4285714285714284
8566972,5,B00BEGZS8S,Mother in law seemed to enjoy it,1433376000,,32,3.7142857142857144
8566973,5,B00BEGZS8S,"Great western 4 pack. Only issue is that its not USA. They all look great and play as they should, but movie names are printed around the edge of the disc and have multiple codes on them for various regions.",1423699200,3,207,4.2
8566974,5,B00BEGZS8S,Just as described great seller,1420329600,,30,5.2
8566975,4,B00BEGZS8S,"I like only two of these movies, but the main point was to get Rio Bravo, and also I do like the Searchers. Rio Bravo was TOO expensive by itself, so I bought this instead.",1420243200,8,172,3.942857142857143
